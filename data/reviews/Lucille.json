{"text":"As a pizza enthusiast, I was really looking forward to trying the trendy flavors this restaurant offers. Unfortunately, the pizza fell somewhat short in comparison to other pizza venues around town. Not only was the pizza a little pricy, but I felt as though it lacked the unique flavors described on the menu. On a different note, the service was absolutely wonderful. Our waiter was constantly checking up on us and even gave us free drinks when someone from outside accidentally threw a cigarette butt into my water glass."}
{"text":"Very nice space and great location. We went for lunch. The food wasn't great though. We had a burger that was overcooked and not fixings. Salad dressing didn't have much flavor. Service was slow. We will likely not repeat."}
{"text":"Great interior design, decent service but not amazing. Staff floated around making marks on iPads without interacting with customers - struck me as a bit odd.  My 2-star review is due to their wheat-contaminated gluten-free pizza crust.  Granted, everyone makes mistakes, but when I let the front-desk staff know that I suffered all weekend because of wheat contamination from their pizza, they shrugged and said 'ok.' and looked away.  No 'oh, thanks for letting us know, we'll work on that.' or 'sorry.'  Just nothing. Can't recommend, as a result."}
{"text":"Really cool decor and ambiance, but seems like a better place to get drinks than a full meal. The pizza -- both styles -- was just okay. The cocktails we tried weren't great either but we could have just ordered wrong. I think it's best to go here for just a nice spot on the square but there's certainly better places nearby to sit down."}
{"text":"Tagline: All the noise and long waits of Merchant but little follow through on the end product. As a Merchant fan, pizza boy, and next door neighbor to Luicille I thought this would be the joint. I am disappointed. 

Beer selection is good.
Meatballs were either undercooked or just fundamentally wrong, mushy and lacking seasoning.
Asparagus salad was ok but for $13, do better. It's just a few veggies with an over easy egg cracked on top.
Pizza/sauce - I tried the Fontana. Overall essence is SALTY. That said, good quality topings, I liked the crust, sauce is blah. Pizza Brutta is better for half the price."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!! Great job!  Pizza was a major disappointment. The deep dish is par baked slabs of dry bread that sits out drying out until someone orders a deep dish pizza. Then they top it and heat it up.  Sorry but we deserve better.  I think they will learn that is not going to work even though it saves prep time.  I will try again in 60 days to see if they nailed the food. Another table waited 90 minutes and they had little kids.   The place is super cool so I will try again after they hopefully fixed the startup issues."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday -- service was very slow, they were busy but no different than typical for a place on the square.  Had the lunch pizza special, it was served with a side of greens and bland vinaigrette.  I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Lucille is one of my favorite restaurants!  We went into today and our server recommended a cocktail special called the Nightmare Before Christmas.  It was one of the best drinks I have ever had.  Despite being busy and without a reservation, the manager, Tara was able to get us a table in a reasonable amount of time and was very accommodating to our needs."}
{"text":"Loved the wood fired pizza. We had the Udemi, super flavorful. The apps looked good too. the atmosphere is fun. See if you can get the seat upstairs looking out on the Capital."}
{"text":"We had such a great dinner at Lucille. While they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday nights, we were thrilled that they could seat our party of 4 on a Friday around 7pm. Very rare for downtown Madison!

They were very accommodating to someone in our group who had a soy allergy, and the staff did a great job of checking ingredients. We loved our cocktails and the $3 shot special. The nachos were amazing and the pizza was delicious! They had plenty of vegetarian options. The service was pretty speedy considering that it was a weekend evening. Love the decor and ambiance. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great if you're looking for a hip atmosphere but you can find more creative and tasty pizza elsewhere in Madison. Good spot for a first date or quick drink but their pizza was expensive and forgettable. Their garlic mascarpone and mushroom pizza was simple and tasty but that was as interesting as the pizzas got."}
{"text":"Pizza for the Merchant crowd. Decor ala Merchant. Bad music. Pizza doesn't touch Sal's...especially for the price...seriously guys? A place you'd take your undergrad sister/brother/out of town cousin."}
{"text":"The food and vibe here is outstanding. It's definitely a place where I'll be taking all our friends when they come into Madison.

For starters, the fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had. If you like buffalo sauce, it's a home run. 

Meatballs - pretty tasty themselves, but the red sauce is magical. 

Entrees:

The pizza sauce is perfect. While I love a good wood fired pizza, the steel pan pizza is Madison's pizza. I mean spotted cow in the dough? It's a thicker pizza with a cheese baked onto the outside of the dough. 

The black mushroom truffle wood fired and Calabrian sausage pizza were the two our table tried.

Dessert:
The only dessert currently in the place is the pizza cookie, but it's all it needs. A partially baked cookie covered with vanilla ice cream. Drool... The entire table can share it and it's a whopping $5. Get 1 per 4 people and you're set.

There's a lounge downstairs, amazing beer selection, and much more I could talk about. Check it out. You won't be upset."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with a small group. The nice-ish toppings on the pizzas, both the wood-fired and the pan, were overwhelmed by the thick, gluey crust mountains. Sort of what you might expect from the pan pizza, but I was disappointed in the crust of the wood-fired pizza. Also, there was a only a shadow of toppings on both pizzas. The music was ridiculously loud for lunch time. 

On the plus side: plenty of chic attire and ambience if you want to look around instead of talking.  Salads are pretty standard greens with dressing, but they remain the meal's high point. Doesn't add much that is new or interesting to the Madison restaurant scene (though maybe the bar time crowd is the target audience?).

I am, however, a huge fan of Chef Evan. I just wish he was still making his Spanglish-inspired sandwich at 4 & 20."}
{"text":"Loved the food and our server, Jenna. Great service and great food!

We ordered the cheese curds and basil + mozzarella pizza. Yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about.  They don't take reservations on Friday nights and we waited for more than two hours, in a hot and steamy \"bank vault\" bar in the basement.  It was stifling and outrageously loud.  The seven of us could not carry on a conversation, except for one on one and even that was super tough.  When we finally got our table upstairs there were so many people standing everywhere, surrounding the bar, but circling our table, that it begged the question of whether or not this establishment is having an identify crisis.  Is it a nightclub or a restaurant?  The crowd was mostly 20 somethings and quite trendy, so honestly, it seems more of a hot spot that food spot.  We again could not carry on a conversation just like in the basement bar area, between the music and the jam-packed space, it was off-the-chart loud.  In fact a child about 8 or 9 walked by our table with his fingers in his ears.  The chairs?  Dear god, what were they thinking?  You have to sit straight up as if on a stool despite there being a chairback.  Now for the food:  Seriously, what is the fuss?  It was not good.  The salad was odd.  The small garden type was huge and bitter with too much dressing.  The pizza?  My partner and I had the veggie steel-pan for 2-3 people.  It was giant and mostly a super thick oily crust with more of a marinara type sauce and not much else. Other folks in the party had a thinner crust variation for 1-2 people.  It was okay.  Just not great.  (A spot on Willy St. has far superior pizza!!!) We ordered three of the cookies with ice cream for dessert and they were seriously inferior--dry, overcooked and uninteresting. The food and ambiance were 100% not worth the wait on a fall Friday night.  We were thinking maybe, just maybe the top floor would be calmer and a tad quieter for a conversation, and we were also thinking that lunch-time in the summer, with all the side glass doors open might make for a much more doable situation."}
{"text":"Quick review:  Food:  delicious.  Service:  Poor.  SLOW.  

Five of us tried Lucille today for lunch.  We were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly.  But, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food.  Lunch should not take nearly two hours.  Patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  

Our wait staff seemed inexperienced.  PLEASE train the staff before you open.

Our party had both the Detroit panned pizza and the Neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza.  We all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch.   Not quite to the standards of Pizza Brutta, but very good.   Pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  

I know the place is new and I will try again.   But, service needs major improvement.  I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places in Madison.  It's got great views of the capital, is new, clean and spacious. The various floors and open center makes for a great airy place to people watch.  The service was outstanding--from the hostess to the bartenders and servers.   They were friendly, conscientious and attentive.  The food was tasty and the portions were generous.  Overall a great place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Had the Hawaiian and Italian Pantry salads, both were exceptional!!! Did not try the pizza but it looked tasty. Attentive service, just right. Perfect spot for a break from the Farmer's Market. Highly recommend!!! Named after B. B. King's guitar???"}
{"text":"I work close by. Went in there when it first open and was not impressed. To clarify, I WAS impressed by the space - it's gorgeous. But my first lunch there was odd because they only had two daily types of pizza for lunch and that's all that you could get. I asked,\"Can I just get a slice of pepperoni?\" Nope. Only whatever they were serving that day. So much for giving the customer what they want. It was more like take it or leave it. I told my friend at work that they would have to change because the rent was surely too expensive to allow the place to be empty at lunchtime.

Today I stopped in again because they finally broke down and started serving more options for lunch...tacos, sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. Aside from a couple of large parties, the place was almost empty. We sat at the bar. I saw some food coming out and it looked really good. I ordered the banh mi and my friend ordered a wrap. Even though neither of our lunches had to be cooked, only assembled, it took forever. It was hard to understand because the kitchen is exposed and we could see that they had five or six people making food. Realizing how long it was taking, the bartender kept coming back to us saying our order would be right up. After we ordered, we sat there over 30 minutes waiting for our food. Finally, we just got up and left. Never did get our food. 

After having two bad experiences there, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I wanted a pizza but the toppings were extremely weird and unappealing so I ordered the tuna ceviche. Who puts canned mandarin oranges and canned mandarin orange juice on sushi grade tuna? Ick! Totally lame, uninspiring dish."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to Lucille, but was disappointed. Too pricey. Our server was just \"ok\". Food was good, and the atmosphere was urban rustic cool. I might maybe probably go back to try again...

But I'll look through the whole menu and find the \"cheap date night special\" next time before I order."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place and location!  We had the nachos (toppings put on in layers!) and shared a pizza.  Food is excellent and wait service was perfect.
Take a few minutes and enjoy a cocktail downstairs in the vault area (very cool)!

Looking forward to many more meals at Lucille!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, location, and drinks, being right off the square and the open concept with high ceilings.  The evening breeze on a hot July day was great.  They also have a walk-up order/takeout area which I think is a great idea.

As for the pizza?  Meh.  I came here to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend, my friend, and her husband.  We started with the cheese curds, which, after eaten many a curd in my life, were mediocre.  You're much better off going to the Old Fashioned or Graze (my favorite) if you want curds.

We ordered the Weekender steel pan pizza and the Sausage and Raab wood-fired pizza.  First, the idea of the steel pan pizza sounds great - the caramelized cheddar cheese crust is what got me.  However, in practice, we got a lukewarm pizza with a soggy, greasy crust.  The Sausage and Raab was a thinner crust, but seemed to lack flavor.  What a shame for something that sounded so good on paper...it really lacked in execution.

Our waiter (sorry, forgot his name) was wonderful, helpful, and genuinely nice.  He overheard it was my birthday, and came out with a surprise giant cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top for the 4 of us to share.  This was definitely unexpected and a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm. I have gone to Lucille now on three occasions. Number 1 was the opening night. I called and they told me no wait! I rushed up to the capital and then they told me an hour and a half wait. We got a drink and bounced.  The drink was yummy but the service was slooow. The basement has a cool old bank vault but is deafeningly loud.

Second time. Popped in on a Friday night. 30 min wait for a table unless I wanted communal seating. Since I don't play well with others, we went across the street to tipsy.

The third time we went for lunch and got right in. They have a few lunch specials where you can choose between cheese or fancy pizzas.  We ordered the chips with vinegar. They were light and crispy but needed a dipping sauce. Good thing we ordered buffalo wings with blue cheese for dipping. The wings were crispy and flavorful. Finally we ordered a pizza with basil and mozzarella. I was pretty disappointed in the pizza. Parts of the crust were burnt.  There was minimal basil. It was just okay. Our 11 inch pizza was $13. Pretty steep for what was on it, in my opinion. The best thing I ate was the pizza cookie for dessert.  

My advice: go for drinks and the pizza cookie and get dinner somewhere better."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night 7:30 and the place was packed but just the 2 of us so we got seated right away. Trendy warehouse district feel to space packed in a little tight in seating but that is okay as it allows you to eye all of your neighbors tasty looking selections. Food and drink prices were high as we knew from looking online so expectations were fairly high and I would say Lucille exceeded them. Wife's drink, Painkiller, came out with the appropriate look for a high end drink and she enjoyed it. Menu had lots of tasty looking selections but I was determined to try the pizza so we ordered a Steel Pan pizza \"Sausage Fest\" $22. Pan with 6 big slices and it was fabulous. The toppings, sauce and cheese were great and the crust was out of this world. Can't wait to go back and try some other options."}
{"text":"Visited here on January 6. Great location and the atmosphere is fun and innovative. We had reservations for a party of 6 adults and a couple kids and were seated right away (a little early, in fact). In spite of being busy, the service was prompt and courteous. This beer selection here is formidable, featuring a number of great local options.  Unfortunately, when you're a restaurant, it's about the food. The artichoke appetizer was mediocre at best.  The real issue was the pizza. We ordered two of the steel pan pizzas and both were only luke warm - maybe room temp.  The sauce on top was actually cool.  The crust on these was the taste and consistency of a box mix. Took some home. Maybe it'll be better reheated. The other thinner crust pizzas were much better but far from my top 10 in Madison alone.
I really looked forward to visiting this place. I might give it another try, but I'd ask a lot of questions when ordering."}
{"text":"This is a place I can say I actually HATE eating at. I've been here for lunch a few times and dinner once, and I think just for drinks/apps at one point. My first lunch there was my worst experience, but my subsequent visits didn't improve much. My lunch experience was truly and rage inducing, insulting experience. (don't worry, I held myself together). I was there with a co-worker and two clients for lunch. We are not a large group (physically I mean) and 4 people literally didn't fit in the booths comfortably. The restaurant was just crammed with tables everywhere which made it nearly impossible to move around. The menu for lunch that day was...2 items. 2! And granted this seems to be a THING in Madison (and maybe other places in the country, but I'm seeing this as a trend in Madison for sure), this concept of \"chef's choice\". I've seen this at upscale restaurants and simple soup/sandwich places as well. The \"chef\" Is literally telling you what you are going to eat. This makes sense in a high-end place or a place that has a famous chef or something, but in a wood-fired brick oven pizza place? Come on. 

Anyway, thankfully the one of the two pizza options they had was something I liked so I ordered that (as did everyone else at the table because there REALLY was no other choice). Pizza and a little salad. How bad can this be? Well, let me tell you. VERY bad. VERY VERY bad. The pizza's show up and they are tiny, which for lunch is probably ok. These are like 4-inch pizzas though. It's barely a snack. Again, it's lunch so whatever. This tiny little pizza is served on a wooden plank next to a pile of...salad I suppose. I like, salads, and I like fancy/unique salads. I'm not an iceberg only guy or anything, but this was literally a pile of weeds and other lawn waste - stems and all. No joke. Anyway, I gave it a shot, but two bites in and the was no saving this pile of whatever it was. There was some sort of dressing on it, but it was either the cause of the nastiness or at least did nothing to save it. Just bitter, bad...ugh.. my stomach is actually turning now as I'm recalling it. 

Moving on to the pizza. It looked really good. Hand made crust, with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes on it. One of my favorite things on this planet. ...and nope. I have no idea what they put in this thing, but it was horrible.. the sauce.. was... I don't know. I can't even describe it... the cheese was stringy, and more/less flavorless. and gosh I can't even remember what else. I remember trying to focus on the crust hoping to find something good about, but I seem to recall nearly breaking a tooth on the edge and the rest being over powered by whatever it was they put on it. I was starving at this point, so I forced the first piece down... and started into the second...I got two or 3 bites in and my body started rejecting it. Like it went into defense mode and wouldn't let me swallow any more of this nonsense. So, I stopped eating and tried to be casual about it. As we left, I noticed that most people had left most of their lunch on the wooden plank as well. 

Anyway, I won't go in to as much detail on my other visits, but they ended much the same way. Drinks maybe. They seemed to have a good beer/wine selection, but the mixed drinks were super weak and expensive. I was there for a drinks/apps night with some business partners we all commented on how weak the drinks were. The apps, I don't seem to recall what we had. Anyway. This place is stupid, crowded and the brick-oven/wood-pizza thing is little more than a gimmick. Heck, I'm seeing food trucks at street fares with \"brick ovens\" in them making MUCH better pizza. This is ANOTHER Madison restaurant I will be actively avoiding."}
{"text":"I believe this is my favorite place for cocktails in madison now. We enjoyed their daiquiri shooters, and I had a really nice hard cider from Seattle. Many of the people in our group tried the craft beers and there were no complaints. We originally spotted this place on the way to the farmers market. They serve pizza through one of their windows to passers by that are on foot, if you don't have time to enjoy their in house atmosphere. The nightly entertainment is solid. Quality dj and delicious shooters on special. Not the kind of place you would come to for rails and syrup like shots. I love the large round booths upstairs, they fit all 7 of us with plenty more room. Go here!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place.  I have only eaten here once so far, but I loved everything about it.  I will be back soon, and often.  Great location just a block off the Capitol square, and a very inviting atmosphere.  Weather permitting, one whole wall is mostly open to the street, allowing the sunshine or breeze to get in, which is really nice when the weather is right.  The menu offers a lot of traditional Italian fare, as well as more adventurous options.  I had the steel pan pizza, and it was fantastic.  Fresh ingredients and excellent preparation made for a meal that should have left me with plenty of leftovers from the generous portions, but I ate the whole thing because I just couldn't resist.  The service was responsive and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable, especially considering the portions and the quality.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Lucille is the kind of spot Madison was missing, I suppose. Something constantly somewhere high enough on the cool scale that you can be safe going there at almost any time of night and have a good time.
The food and drinks are good but not killer. This place is more about a fun, contemporary vibe for evening drinks and loud music where you can ALSO get some good food.
They did to a GREAT job on the design though! 
The biggest draw is their amazing setup on the sharp corner of King Street when al of the windows and doors are open on the north side of the restaurant. Nothing better on a spring or summer night (so far... I assume fall will be no different). And it doesn't hurt that they often have a DJ on the lofted upper floor playing to the crown downstairs. Definitely a place to \"be seen\" (whatever that actually means in Madison haha) but still the place to go for that atmosphere.
Go and get the punch bowls and run around."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that this place is great. They have some kinks to work through. I'll list some likes and dislikes below. 
Likes: great food, atmosphere, and drinks. Austin was a great server. The salads was fresh and the pizza was delicious. 
Dislikes: the menu said $3 taps. It was not reflected on our bill. If there are promos, honor them. Is that only from 2-5p.m.? Say that on the menu. The weeknight specials look like they should go all night. 
The cocktails were $10 a piece. For that price, I don't want it to be watered down by 18 ice cubes. It was delicious at first, but as the ice melted it tasted like water. 
The waitress told us it was a 30 minute wait. We left and grabbed a drink at another bar. Within 5 minutes our table was ready. It was a bummer that we paid for drinks elsewhere because of poor and planning. Give us an accurate timeframe so we don't waste time or money elsewhere! 

I have really high hopes for this place. I'll be back. Please work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"I love coming here when I need to have a drink with my girls. This place is classy, clean, and the music is on point! The setting is really relaxed and can be a good place for a nice intimate dinner. The view of the capital from the upper level is amazing! If you're looking for a nice classy place on a Saturday, with good drinks, good company, and good music. Come here. You won't be mad."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance and yummy food. Two styles of pizza always on the menu, a great draft beer list, and top notch appetizers with ingredients that are all locally sourced. I love their steel pan nachos as an appetizer. I prefer the wood fired pizza over the steel pan, which is more of a deep dish style. We had the sausage and raab this time, but have also enjoyed the Umami pie, which was outstanding."}
{"text":"We are in love with Lucille. Yes, it's pricey. But I don't mind paying a bit more for delicious food. 

We've been twice and have tried a number of things. 

The curds are perfection--a break from the standard cheddar with their stringy mozzarella-- and the best marinara. 

We've had the fontina and the black garlic something or other thin wood fire pizza. Both were good and the black garlic hit it out of the park. 

For the steel pans, we've had the tiki (great twist on the classic Hawaiian with run soaked pineapple and pickled jalapeños), the weekender (all the flavors blended perfectly), and a meat lovers type one (don't remember the name but nothing particularly spectacular about it). I LOVE the way the crust is airy and beery tasting and the way it gets caramelized and crunchy on the edges. I normally don't like thick crust but this is fab."}
{"text":"Went here for some late night noms after a long day of drinking at the Terrace. 3 members of our 6-member group arrived a few minutes before the rest of us and were seated at a 4-top near the bar. We were a little confused as we had told them that we had 6 in our group. We asked if we could sit in the relatively upstairs in a booth where we could all sit together and were told that was fine. After settling in, we were told by a different waitress that they did not take orders or serve food upstairs after 10 on a Sunday. However, we could go down to the bar and order and wait for the food there. We chose that option and two of us went down to order for the table. 
My husband and I split a BYO wood-fire grilled pizza with sausage and feta. They did not skimp on either ingredient. The crust was doughy, yet crunchy (if that makes sense!). We also split the dessert pizza because \"treat yo' self.\" Highly recommend. Best $6 you'll ever spend!
I also got a drink, but can not for the life of me remember the name of it. 

I plan on returning sometime when I haven't been drinking all afternoon so I can truly appreciate the food and decor more.  But it won't be after 10 PM on a weeknight..."}
{"text":"Been here before for drinks, but tonight I finally ventured there for food. The restaurant is truly beautiful and has an amazing vibe. The large windows that open to the street make it an excellent location.

The date night deal is really a bang for your buck. My friend and I had a delicious summer squash pizza, as well as a Hawaiian salad, wine, and a brownie for $40. The food was great and the service was quick and friendly. 

It was above average but not the best I've had so that's why it gets 4 stars. I definitely recommend checking it out and at least enjoying the comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch during the week and was pretty happy with the lunch scene...plenty of open seating, bar stools at a wrap around bar, an upstairs seating area and friendly service that greets you right away!

I had heard they were known for their pizza, and they do have a lunch special with a slice - your choice woodfired or deep dish - that comes out pretty fast (within minutes).

However, the bartender recommended their burger, so I tried their burger and a cup of Broccoli cheese soup.  Wow!  Great food, and a really good burger, with pimento cheese spread and fried pickles!  It was excellent!

The service is great, the food is hot and fresh, and they have more than just pizza (hence the burger I tried :) on the menu.  They also have a full bar, as I found out as I witnessed some folks enjoying a few cocktails with their food.

They have a great atmosphere, friendly staff, good, hot food, and a great bar...I will have to come here for happy hour or late night and try it out again (and the pizza)!"}
{"text":"We only wound up here because many other places were packed. However it was quite the little find!

When we went, there was a concert going on just outside on King Street, so there was a very rowdy crowd at the bar. The food was superb and service was prompt and helpful. 

The overall noise level was quite high, and it was difficult to hold a conversation with my elderly grandparents. However, a younger group would not have had as much of an issue, and the event outside may have contributed to the issue."}
{"text":"This review is exclusively for the take-away lunch aspect of Lucille. I'd have sat down to eat, but the techno soundtrack was a bit much to celebrate at 11:30am on a weekday.

Walking down Pinckney to tend to some business, I was surprised to see Lucille with a little take-away lunch stand set up in the window. There seems to be a widening gulf between 'restaurants where one can take their food to go easily' and 'restaurants one actually wants to eat at', so I was excited to try. Eventually, I got the attention of the cashier and ordered the pizza of the day.

I had expected some prepared pizzas for a quick lunch, but instead it took 15 minutes to prepare my pizza (believe it was some sort of chicken and onion). The pizza was tasty enough, but not remarkable and rather small. It came with a side salad that, again, got the job done but wasn't memorable. The overall effect is likely a good $10 lunch in Chicago or another city, but high by Madison standards.

Pizza and salad lunch box set me back $10. I assume that if they'd used a less-nice box, they could have taken some off the price - it was a very classy box. The whole place looks extremely hip, so maybe I need to put on my hip shirt and sit down and have a hip drink with hip people sometime to give it a fairer (hip) shake."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and, unexpectedly great pizza alternatives like tacos and cheese curds. We ate at Lucille after walking around the Madison Farmer's Market and it was a great place to sit back, enjoy the hip decor and view of the square, while sipping on Bloody Mary's. I need to go back here and continue trying the menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.

The check in offer here is a great deal, and may have been the reason that I went out for pizza.

As an appetizer we had the artichoke dip, which was only OK. I was expecting a cream cheese based dip with chunks of artichoke hearts, but this was a smooth sauce with melted cheese on top. 

There was a small hiccup in service where we were brought out the wrong pizza, when we pointed out the mistake to our server we were given the oops pizza free of charge and the one we ordered arrived shortly after.

The umami pizza was very non-traditional but very tasty. This was the best pizza I have had in at least year."}
{"text":"Food was amazing: cheese curds and the Weekender pizza. The crust on the steel pan pizzas is awesome if you like it thick, bready, and crisp on the outside. The atmosphere is cool and beer list has lots of choices. Service was fine, but the one downfall was that we felt rushed out of there with our waiter coming by frequently while we were still finishing eating (and there were empty tables.) After we ordered a second round of drinks the waiter stopped rushing us. Overall, great place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped here for lunch today after getting our marriage license. It was seat yourself, so we went upstairs and grabbed a table. Since we both had to go back to work in the afternoon, we stuck to water. We ordered the Italian Pantry Salad with avocado and \"The Queen\" wood fired pizza with extra mozzarella. 

The salad came out first, and was delicious. The greens were evenly dressed, and the toppings worked well together. I would come back for this salad alone. We planned to split the salad, but my fiancé and I wasted no time in conversation as we devoured it.

Next the pizza came out. This took a a little longer to arrive than we expected, which normally wouldn't be an issue, but it was lunch service, so we expected the pizza to come out a little sooner. However, when it did arrive, we were very pleased. The crust had the right amount of chew to it, with the edges a bit charred. The cheese was nicely melted and little bit carmelized, and the sauce did not drown the pie, but gave a sweet tomato kick. I ate three pieces before forcing myself to stop, but could have had an additional 3 slices.

I would've normally opted for the detroit style pan pizza, but my fiancé is not a fan of thicker crusts. I did notice the table next to us had ordered the detroit style and it looks like a very generous lunch portion, but I was still more than pleased with the wood-fired had tossed crust.

Our total visit lasted for about 70 minutes. I would definitely return, would recommend to others. However, it will likely be for dinner or on an afternoon when I do not need to return to work - which will allow me to have a few beers or bourbons with my salad and pizza."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup lacked flavor.  The only thing that saved it was the salt.  Pizza is mediocre.  Their tomato bisque is excellent.  Service is slow even when they are not busy.  Nearly impossible seating around the bar... why is it so necessary to have small stools placed so closely together?  A big blah."}
{"text":"Lucille is a very cool place for drinks and dining on the Square and we enjoyed both.  The only negative is that it can get quite noisy, but that's not really the restaurant's fault. Just be prepared to shout across the table at your companions while you enjoy your delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Very excited for the soft opening of Lucille, a new restaurant from the same crew that brought us Merchant. They did a great job renovating this space for an industrial chic look. The main floor is dominated by a bar and communal tables. The walls and ceiling are brick / cement so it does start to get loud as the place fills up. The second floor has high exposed ceilings with large booths and tables surrounding a balcony that opens up to downstairs. The final touch is an additional bar area in the basement where they offer lounge seating in a neat space which used to be a bank safe, complete with the former vault door intact. 

The staff was spot on, who would know it was day #1. Our only beef was the beers were coming out with a bit too much foam so then you weren't really ending up with a full beer. Every drop counts, agh!  They were offering a limited menu of appetizers and pizzas during the soft opening, the full menu will be available likely next week. Hours are also limited to dinner this weekend but their regular expanded (including lunch) hours will likely start next week. All the food we tried was good. The garden goddess salad was tossed with dressing & available in a small ($6) or large ($11) size. The small size was perfect for one person. Cheese curds were tasty and served with marinara sauce. The pizzas we tried were tasty (baby spinach, olive, onion pizza has a spicy kick!), crispy thin and nicely topped. A great first experience, I'm excited to return to try the steel pan (deep dish) pizzas once they are offering the full menu."}
{"text":"New chef and now the food is amazing. Make sure you get the deep dish and the pizza cookie!"}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoyed the wood fired pizza. The ingredients were clearly fresh, the quality of the food was awesome and we had good service.  Here is another restaurant that will be added to the list for regular visits when I am in town. Try it out! It was pretty good stuff."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/vibe/decor is 5/5 no question. Not much of a fancy cocktail person so I just give a generic thumbs up because they have whiskey they can put over rocks for me. The pizza sadly is no better than a 3/5. 

The magic number feels like 4 stars overall. With all that the Madison food scene has to offer, go to Lucille for drinks before/after dinner elsewhere. The greater point there being you should work in a stop at Lucille though. Cool spot."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!!! We got both a thick crust and a thin crust and loved them both equally. The best pizza in Madison by far"}
{"text":"I have chosen this place as my go-to birthday dinner with the family for a few years now! I'm a huge fan of the steel pan pizza style, and Lucille does the crust just right. I always promise myself I'll try the tacos or nachos next time, but never get away from the pizza. 
Tonight was a slower night in the kitchen but the yelp check in offer eased the wait. Two hours in and out on a Wednesday night but it was just us and the kids and we weren't in a hurry. 
My better half and I split a steel pan and a 10\" wood fired and they were both good. The wood fired was a few seconds too long in the oven with a little char but I don't mind that and prefer that to it being pulled too early so it's all good. The craft cocktail menu is excellent. Tonight I had the starlit skinny dip and loved it. And thank you for not serving with a straw- whether that was by accident or design we could all do well to use fewer straws, right? I'm trying anyway! Don't forget to end your meal with the steel pan cookie and ice cream....
I've not had a bad experience here; some nights are better than others but they do things right for the most part and I always enjoy myself and look forward to my return!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is super cool but I think the pizza is lacking. They have a great beer menu and bar which is reason enough to go. It's a fun place in Madison for pre or post drinks but don't go for the pizza or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate here for a friend's birthday before a show at the Overture Center. All around the food and drinks were excellent. We ordered a deep dish pepperoni and two thin-crust pizzas. All were excellent. Drinks were as good as Merchant (same owners). This is definitely an A-list restaurant in its category. The space itself is unique and interesting. 

Service was friendly and efficient. Atmosphere was a bit loud and very dark (we sat upstairs). It was difficult to read the menus - this was the first time I used my mobile phone to light my menu! And I am not at the bifocal/bright light age yet!"}
{"text":"No, no, no. I was so excited to try Lucille, but left so disappointed. 

The space itself is really cool. It's very large and really does a great job blending the old with the new. The \"\"speak-easy\" in the basement is a great feature. 

Beer list is good, though they were out of the Belgian Quad I wanted to try. Cocktails are pricey but I've heard also tasty. Service was also good and prompt.

My issue is the food. The pizza just was not great. I tried the steel pan Tiki Pizza and was so disappointed. There was not enough mozzarella on the pizza itself - it was very dry. Also, the jalapeno didn't seem pickled at all. It was overwhelmingly spicy (probably didn't help that the seeds were left on). All I could taste was spice, no flavor at all. The crust shows promise, though the cheese on the outside didn't provide the flair I expected. 

My dining companions ordered the wood fired and theirs looked a bit better, though quite soggy. My boyfriend ordered chicken on his and what came was very clearly frozen chicken breast that had been cut into little chunks. It looked like the chicken you find in a frozen bag at the grocery store. He didn't eat it.

I was so sad about our experience I donated my leftovers (basically the whole pizza) to the first homeless person we saw when walking to our car. Nice gesture, yes, but it usually isn't so easy for me to give my food away. I won't be looking to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a great first-time experience at Lucille. We were there at 5:30 on a Saturday night and the service was excellent. We were able to sit at the bar and have a few drinks before dinner, but I can see how it could get pretty busy in there. Our waiter was super friendly and did a great job keeping our drinks filled and checking up on us. The pizza was really good, but I wasn't blown away. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great drinks selection but falls a little short on the pizza front. I was disappointed because everything about this place is great with the exception of the actual Pizza."}
{"text":"I know this is a pizza place, mainly, but NACHOS. Nachos. Nachos! They are the best nachos I've ever had--loaded with pork shoulder, mozzarella, queso, pickled onions, sour cream, pickled jalapeño, pico de gallo and cilantro. It is so good that I filled my stomach to the brim before the pizzas even arrived (#noregrets). 

The other app we got--the meatballs--were also delicious with a fresh and flavorful marinara sauce so good that I had to (had. to.) eat the leftovers with a spoon. Normally, neither nachos nor meatballs would be on my radar, but Lucille has forever changed my ways. 

The pizza I definitely liked but didn't loveeee overall (and we ordered a lot of pies to share). I'll admit that part of it could've been the comparison to the nachos (THE nachos) but nothing really stood out to me EXCEPT the black garlic pizza. The black garlic pizza is sooooooo good that I wished we had ordered 4 of those. The meat pizza was pretty good too just because it featured the same sauce that dressed the meatballs. The Tikka pizza was pretty good with a little jalapeño kick, but nothing spectacular. The chard pesto/pinenut/feta pizza and squash/ricotta pizzas were utterly flavorless and disappointing. We couldn't even finish one piece of the squash and I regretted eating a whole piece of the pesto. 

The drink options are really interesting but expensive ($9-$15), and the drinks we ordered came out different each time. But hey, they did the job. The industrial vibe is really cool and there is a vault bar in the basement that is definitely worth a visit after dinner or as a separate trip entirely!

Gotta give Lucille a 4 out of 5 for the BOMB nachos and meatballs, decent pizza, expensive but interesting drinks, and cool industrial ambiance. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Update--I've had the wood fire pizza and the Italian salad.  It was amazing.  The home sausage was mouth popping flavorful with a bit of spice.  The crust is crispy and chewy as good as I've tasted.


Definitely my favorite steel pan pizza.  I haven't tried the wood fired pizza yet, but my wife did and she said it was excellent.  Fresh, well balanced, with a chewy and crisp crust.

The salads are very good, a solid Italian dressing with fresh veggies.  

I have had a few of the steel pan pizzas.  I really like crust.  It has a good buttery flavor and it is crisp and crusty without being tough.  The cheese and meats are very good.  They make some excellent combinations. The sauce is either on top or on the side.  It is a bit sweeter than many, it doesn't have an herb flavor either.  It is more like a marinara sauce.  It is definitely good, but it may not be for everyone.  I think it really brings the pizza ingredients together."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a Monday night at 10-11pm! In fact, I'd say the crowd of 30 or so people was about perfect for what I would want on a Monday night bar foray.

the music was good, the bartenders were cool, the other patrons were all less obnoxious than I, and the free check-in offer daiquiri didn't hurt! (Tasty drink, by the way.)"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice space. Open. Well appointed. Tried it for lunch. Two of sat at bar. Crowded but we got there at 12:30 after the rush. 
Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order. When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu. They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy. Manager standing around watching instead of helping. Back to reading menu. Decided to just get the pizza special. 
Beer came. Very short pour.  When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter. Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor. At best. Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. 
Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes. Time to leave. 
Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out. Paid for the drinks snd left. 
Bartender at least tried, earning the two stars and maybe a trip back. 
Nice, but seems pretentious, over priced and under managed."}
{"text":"Great pizza place with amazing apps the fried green tomatoes were amazing and the deep dish ind. pan pizza is amazing"}
{"text":"The location, building and build-out is really nice.  The exposed brick, steel beams and open concept makes for a noisy but very appealing spot.  

We tried both the regular and pan pizza.  Both were good but not great.  I'd prefer Pizza Bruta for the Neapolitan at half the price, and the pan pizza was something between Chicago deep dish and Rocky Rocco's.   

My wife had a drink called a painkiller and she thought it was great.  I had two beers off a very nice and varied beer selection.  

I know there is a premium for the location and the venue, but two pizzas, two beers and a drink for $70+ with tip seemed to be steep.  I don't mind spending for good quality but, at the end of the day, it is pizza.  

I'm certain to be back, next time I will not have the sticker-shock."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. The staff clearly cared about the experience for each customer. The pizza was prompt and delicious, I prefer the the wood fire, we had the asparagus and ham it was super good!! I really loved the downstairs bar! The whole entire setup was amazing. To think that they transformed an office building full of cubicles into a bar/restaurant is pretty stellar!"}
{"text":"Great late night stop. The building is gorgeous with the open industrial feel. Late night they have pizza specials and an awesome DJ. I liked the lounge feel! The service was super slow and it took forever for drinks, but once we got them they were great. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We had some friends in town last weekend who wanted pizza and burgers so we decided to try Lucille. It's a beautifully restored building facing the capital. Three stories. The main floor has a gorgeous bar with an excellent selection of tap beers. The upstairs has even better views of the capital and a wrap-around mezzanine. We didn't check out the basement. We put in our name and waited at the bar for a table. The bartenders were busy but friendly.

They texted us when our table was ready and we headed upstairs. It was a bit of a tight squeeze between us and the tables next to us. Our waiter was friendly, prompt, and helpful. I definitely give a thumbs up on the service.

For food we had a pizza, a couple of burgers, and the smoked fish dip. I liked the fish dip though I thought it could use a little more spice. It paired well with the crackers and I was pleased with the variety of veggies that came with it. We had the Lucille Burger and a veggie Lucille Burger. The fried pickles on top were yummy - greasy and hot. The pimento spread thick and yet runny - great flavor but a mess to eat. I actually thought the bun was surprisingly tasty. My burger was perfectly cooked although my friend didn't think it was one of the better veggie burgers he has had. The chips were OK, nothing special. The pizza was wood-fired. We had one of the seasonal specials with sausage and root vegetables. Decent but nothing to write home about. The pizza prices felt quite a bit higher than expected and the burger prices just a bit more than expected.

In general I really liked the ambiance and was impressed with the selection and the service. I thought the food was good albeit overpriced. I'd be happy to return but it won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating, as a Chicagoan, the bar is HIGH for pizza and cocktails, and this place was such a fantastic highlight to our quick trip up to Madison! The vibe is very industrial-chic, and there's plenty of space and seating for a ton of people but somehow doesn't feel crammed (the upstairs is unique and private feeling which is great). As a purveyor of fine cocktails I couldn't have been more stoked to see this craft menu. I started with the Foster the People and actually came back for a second because it was THAT good. Next I moved onto the Madtown Vice which was equally delish. My fiancé tried the Mexican Firing Squad and he also loved it. As for the entrees, I got the gluten free pizza and my fiancé got a caesar salad and we both loved our selections! I'd come back to this spot in a heartbeat next time we're up in Madison. Great service, great food, great vibe!"}
{"text":"I have visited Lucille more times than I can count, and that's the honest truth. I finally got around to visiting this restaurant with a group of friends. We were 7 total, and this was during their Wednesday date night special. We were seated immediately in an upstairs booth. Overall, the space is VERY accommodating for larger parties. The booth comfortably sat 7 of us, but a few more bodies definitely fit. Wednesday date night is such a steal, including: A bottle of bubbly, salad, pie of your choice, AND dessert. Three couples=three bottles of sparkling wine=fantastic time. The restaurant was busy, filled with chatter,  popping bottles, and delicious smells. Please make it a priority to order the pork nachos and the Painkiller cocktail. These are consistently fantastic. I also had the Five Cheese pie with the addition of bacon lardons, very tasty. I will be returning for sit down dinner very soon."}
{"text":"New favorite bar in Madison by far! Used to be the Isthmus and minus the office walls, the layout is the same. Only much more stripped down and with a bar on the main floor. Though, I'm not entirely convinced that the Isthmus didn't have a secret bar somewhere...

We started from the bottom and worked out way up, there's just something about drinking beers in a refurbished bank vault that excites! It's an upscale place too, everyone was dressed up and not many guys wearing hats. A very nice change of pace from what you'd find on State Street!

Main level was of course the most packed, the balcony area I think is the unsung hero of this new location. They stripped back the walls to the original structure and on one portion the original painted on sign for \"The Capital City\" was present. Music was also great, not too loud, still could hear your friends across the table from you.

Can't wait to come back, this is definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Went here for the third time this past Saturday for a birthday dinner and drinks... one of my fave establishments by far!!! The pork shoulder nachos are the BEST nachos you'll ever have! Nick took care of us and was beyond friendly and hospitable! Love this place..."}
{"text":"A truly spectacular addition to the Square!  I can't remember a time when I could get pizza on the square.  Hats off to the design and construction team on a job well done.  There are about 25 unique taps on the main level that are consistently being rotated.  For those of you who log unique beers on 'Untappd', you will find a new unique beer here.  The bar is large so I have found it easy to find service.  Great craft cocktails as well!  In the private dining area upstairs, we received really solid service after spending a shorter than expected wait.  We enjoyed our cocktails and conversation in the bank vault downstairs while waiting for a table. Time passed quickly!!!  Our food was delicious and the view info the Capitol is fabulous.  Don't forget to try the warm cookie dessert!! The balcony overlook to the Capital will quickly become a popular FB, Twitter, and Instagram spot!  Overall, our dining experience was fantastic!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For Madison, this is one of my favorite bars to visit. The fact that it was a bank and they kept most of the interior really shows through and is really fun to be immersed in. I haven't eaten here yet, but I plan to. So for now, this review is in regards to the bar vault at the bottom. and speaking of which, is where everyone should start. There are three levels here. The main level you enter on, the upstairs area, and the bank vault at the bottom, where they turned the vault itself into a beautiful and comfy lounge. The bar downstairs is always busy and the staff is always very nice. I usually order an old fashioned and I'm never disappointed. Their beer selection is mostly local and which the prices of drinks are a little pricey, you get a great drink with awesome ambiance. It is definitely a bar I plan on frequenting whenever I go out."}
{"text":"Food is great. Nachos are even better. Solid atmosphere for 20 somethings or 20-somethings at heart."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food at Lucille's, but we didn't get to eat there on a recent Saturday afternoon.  When we arrived, we were told it would be a half an hour wait.  That was OK, and they took our cell number and said they would text us when a table was ready.  When we were messaged that our table was ready, we were then told that the kitchen was backed up and our order would likely take another 20 minutes.  They should have told us that when we checked in.  Too bad.  We decided not to wait and chose to go elsewhere. We MAY try them again some other day."}
{"text":"Food was good! But they always run out of deep dish pizzas so if you want one.. You'll be having an early dinner. 

Service was good! 

Wait times are very long.  Hostess told us 2+ hours, the only saving grace was they text you so you don't need to stay at the restaurant.

No reservations are allowed."}
{"text":"The cocktails are very good and probably what Lucille is best known for. If you are going just for drinks heading downstairs to the vault is nice and often a little quieter. The pizza is pretty good but a number of them are a bit unusual. Maybe I'm a pizza traditionalist, but I'm not convinced BBQ sauce belongs on pizza. Some of the more typical combos like the Tomato Pie are quite good."}
{"text":"I was at Lucille today for my friend's birthday and we ordered several appetizers including cheese curds and the Italian salad.  Both appetizers were delicious and came in a timely fashion even though the restaurant seemed busy.  We ordered the queen and a build your own pizza, which were just as great.  Our server Josh was friendly and made the birthday girl feel incredibly special. He was incredibly accommodating and made the experience one to remember. They gave our group a warm birthday dessert on the house.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service!

Large beer  selection!

Tasty food!

You truly cannot go wrong!

I went late at night for a night cap with a friend.  We loved the service and the menu so much, we returned for lunch! 

I highly recommend the market salad!"}
{"text":"Ok so I honestly have only been here one time and while it was great....it was also a long time ago.

I will be back some day and I will write an updated review.

In the meant time....

You can't hardly go wrong with pizza and good microbrews! The atmosphere is exceptional and I hope this place will become a Madison staple for a long time."}
{"text":"The best selfie spot in Madison 

This space is stunning. Three stories - including a vault bar downstairs. Capitol views. I would hang out here for hours enjoying the environment.

And you will hang out there for hours. It's kind of slow service, so prepare yourself for that.

Solid food options for suresies. I've had a few of the pizzas and the special of the day was by far the tastiest of those.

Oddly enough - nachos. Bomb.com. Get the nachos."}
{"text":"Came here for date night and had an awesome time! We made a reservation ahead of time, which I would recommend for Wednesday date night as this place is hopping! For $40, you get a bottle of sparkling wine, 10\" pizza, salad, and a dessert. We ordered the Umami Pie, which comes with black garlic creme fraiche, manchego, grilled chicken, roasted mushrooms, spinach, caramelized onion, fresh rosemary, and scallion. It was delicious. For the salad, we had the caesar salad, which was good. My only complaint is that the dessert, a warm pizza cookie, was overdone. Otherwise, I would have given this place 5 stars. They have other specials throughout the week, but I definitely plan to return for Wednesday date night."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite place in town! Happy hour any day is amazing, but on Fridays there is FREE pizza at 4pm, that's right, FREE! 
The food and cocktails are amazing but I have to rave about the service. Josh was absolutely wonderful. He had amazing menu knowledge and great recommendations! 
I highly recommend Lucille, and ask for Josh when you come!"}
{"text":"This place does some mad social-media marketing. I loved it and wanted to come check it out. Went a few weeks back with my wife for a early dinner. I got the impression from friends that it gets crazy busy at times so it was nice to come when it was slower. Very cool building - they did a great job converting an old space into something interesting. We were upstair which has a cool vibe and a casual and comfy feeling. Started with the Fried Cedar Grove Cheese Curds - these were good but ours were a touch overdone and it came with a ton of paprika-lime mayo (only really needed about a 1/3 of what they gave us). The main menu is basically two types of pizzas - Steel Pan and Wood fired. We decided to try one of each. Needless to say we don't mind leftovers (especially when its pizza!). I got a Wood-Fired pizza on special that night - a Jambalaya pizza with andouille sausage. It had great taste but needed a touch more cheese. It was kind of Jambalaya on pizza crust instead of Jambalaya flavored pizza. Still not a disappointment at all and the slightly burnt wood-fired taste was very good. My wife got a build your own steel pan. Pepperoni and mushroom I believe. She loved it - crunchy burnt cheese around the crust and great flavor. We had a debate over which style was best. I think I liked the burnt flavor of mine but the taste of hers. Guess we'll have to come back again and try some more! Service was great and we had a great time - I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars - it was a bit expensive and I wasn't blown away... I rarely give 5 stars (reserve those for outstanding places) but this was definitely like a 3.75. I'll try to come back again soon and see if the next visit seals the deal. Nice place though. Yum ; 0"}
{"text":"Another amazing conception by two great business partners. The food is stellar and the ambiance is fresh and hip. Love it and continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Great bar. Service was amazing. Food was amazing. I watched some rude customer yell at a bartender that gave him over the top service. I'd recommend this bar, their food, their drinks and their great bartenders to anybody."}
{"text":"So, yeah, where to begin. Lucille is pretty good - I'm a fan of the pizza and the diverse menu. And that bar downstairs - that's a nice place to hang out. Overall the decor gets a 5/5.

The only problem we've had in the past is getting seated, and once we do get a table it feels like we're always on a double date with random people. Serves us right, I guess, for agreeing to sit at the community table on a busy Friday night, but the seating in this area seems just a little too tightly packed - it might be nice to eliminate one place setting on each side and give each person 2 more inches of elbow room. So ambiance / feel gets 2/5. 

The wood fired and pan style pizzas are good - we had one of each and unfortunately they came out in dramatically different times, for the obvious reason of different baking times. Kind of a bummer because some people could be finished eating (wood fired pizza) before other guests food is even done cooking (pan). Food 3/5. 

Service was OK - any lack in service probably had more to do with where we were sitting (busy community table) than the overall care of the server. Still, could have been better, so 4/5. 

Overall, I guess we're going with 4/5. Will I go back? Definitely for drinks in the basement bar, and likely dinner on a quiet(er) weeknight."}
{"text":"Very good place to come! We were not sure if they accommodate children when we came, but they were very accommodating. Not much of a children's menu, but pizza is pretty universal. Brought us the wrong beer but it was still good. Will come back again! Steel pan pizza is amazing FYI!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my girlfriends 1 year anniversary together and we had an unbelievable experience. From the Hosts doing a killer job, to the service we received on a BUSY Friday to the timeliness of our food it was a 10/10 not to mention we were sat right in front of the capital which was unbelievable view. We only got apps and drinks which is okay because we will be going back to try some more food. They are killing the game and not being too classy/pricey about it"}
{"text":"Nothing but compliments as far as the drinks and atmosphere. The vault downstairs is amazing and the bartenders and barbacks are smoking hot .  A lot of time and effort goes into each drink and are well worth a generous tip.  The food is ok and the deep dish is basically the equivalent of DiGiorno. Nachos were great and the service is second to none. The crowd seen here is younger-middle aged professional to typical Madison hipster. Great place to have a few drinks with friends or coworkers but don't be surprised if your bill ends up being over $100 as the drinks are more on the expensive side. Understandable as they want to attract a certain crowd."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza before and it's really good, a unique take on deep dish that reminds me of my favorite pizza place in Chicago - Pequod's.  What really amazed me about this place was the nachos and tacos.  We were craving nachos and wanted to stop in and try the steel pan version Lucille offers.  They were the best nachos I've ever had in my entire life and I consider nachos part of the food pyramid. The baja tacos were delicious as well.  Extensive beer list is definitely a plus and the service was top notch.  I will be back next time I'm craving nachos and good beer.  Come for the pizza, stay for the nachos."}
{"text":"I really love the design and decor, stunning from the old Isthmus newspaper. That's the charm of Lucille, once the bartender Preston approached it was all lost. So rude and pompous. You'd think a new place would want to attract new customers, not scare them away before they've had a chance to order a drink. Hospitality isn't for every place I've learned from Lucille."}
{"text":"We went to Lucille on a Saturday afternoon - during happy hour. We ordered a beer, cocktail and gluten-free pizza. Their home made sausage and tomato sauce are really good. We're giving it a 5 for having good gluten free pizzas (although not home-made GF crusts) and for the happy hour - which gives you 20% off of everything (including food). Full-service at the bar."}
{"text":"Driest pizza we've ever had on both their gluten free & regular crusts, & we consume ALOT of pizza. Premixed 'craft' cocktails, !!! Caesar slams, we asked if it was super anchoviey, waitress 'no', reality yes.... the place looks so great & inviting, though uber disappointing."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to revisit Lucille again. We visited on a Tuesday at 8pm. We went just to grab a few cocktails and it turned out the restaurant was still very lively. The bar was still entirely full so we asked the hostess if there was any room downstairs in the bank vault bar. She explained that area is only open during the weekends and offered to seat us immediately at a table upstairs which was just fine by us. 

Once we were seated we were promptly given menus and started looking at the drink list. Then the waitress arrived to take our order and we ordered our cocktails. She asked if we were ready to order dinner and we explained that we were only there for drinks. She immediately asked if the hostess explained that the table we were at was for dinner only. We said no and then there was a very long awkward silence. It was almost like she expected us to order some food or leave. Then after several moments she said it was ok and left. This moment and her attitude put a huge damper on the night. After the first drink we got the bill and left. Neither of us felt very welcome after that encounter and we also felt like we were being a burden on the waitress. 

On the positive side the drinks look like they have definitely improved although the menu appears to be the same. I ordered a sazerac which is comparatively a pretty hard drink to master. The sazerac was made very well and I would absolutely order it again. 

Really hoping this place improves with a bit more experience and time. Great location, great food, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Good vegetarian options! Amazing drinks! Bartenders and servers are very professional and helpful, all around great service. Josh was my server and he was so helpful with menu selections! This place is so cool inside. Definitely a must dine in for full experience!"}
{"text":"I was very excited about having a new place to go to downtown. So I went with a friend last Tuesday. We had heard the pizza was not stellar so ordered the cheese curds and salads instead, both of which were decidedly mediocre. The wine was good. Overall, I don't understand why there is a 45 minute wait for a table and will likely not come back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an impromptu, early drinks and dinner. They had $3 beer specials from 5-7 which we took advantage of.  The atmosphere is nice, a spacious three floors with lots of light and open floor plan.  I overheard the bartender say the second floor is tables for reservations, main floor is the main bar and a few communal banquets, and the lower level is the secondary bar and original bank vault available for seating.  We tried the house salt and vinegar chips which were tasty, but could've been crispier and more vinegary.  Next we shared the Sausage Fest thick crust pizza which was excellent.  They add a whole other level of crispiness to the crust by a light addition of shredded cheddar to caramelize the outside.  Along with a great beer selection, specialty drink menu, and friendly, knowledgeable staff, we will return very soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza. Best deep-dish I've ever."}
{"text":"They had a rough start, but seemed to have worked out most of the kinks.  The ambiance is the best new thing on the Isthmus, filling a void.  Be sure to check out the downstairs vault bar which is carved out of an old bank.  The beer selection is larger than first blush, with a list on the wall, and choices in the basement as well.  The pizza was 4 of 5 stars, but they kept running out of ingredients the first month...so ordering was hit or miss.  Staff needs to be a little more attentive, as it is common to wait 10 minutes or more for a drink."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have decided it's the best pizza I've ever had. So so so good. BLT pizza blew my mind. The cheese pizza has cream cheese on it and it is amazing. Both the deep dish and wood fired are amazing but the wood fired is the best pizza there is. On top of that, it's beautiful in there and there's a wonderful view of the capital. Everything on the menu is very cool and exciting. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but I was really unimpressed by the service.  It was busy, but not packed, on a weekday afternoon when I went.  It took ages to get served, even though there were servers and bartenders kind of standing around not doing much and making eye contact with us.  When we finally got to order, just our food came and not our drinks.  Finally, we spoke to one of the bartenders who actually seemed to know how to do his job. He took ownership even though it definitely wasn't his fault, and tried to make it right for us.  He was great, but everyone else? Not so much.  And my standards for customer service are pretty low, so I think it says a lot that I was actually annoyed by the entire thing.

The space is beautiful and the food is good but I can't justify spending this much when the dining experience was so poor."}
{"text":"Great ambiance with a a unique design and layout that really makes for a wonderful dining experience.  

I have been here many times and tried a variety of the pizzas and they are all delicious.  The Umami pie is probably the star of the show out of all the ones I've had.  If you're only visiting or there for the first time, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best Moscow Mule i've had so far! Will definitely bring back more family and friends to enjoy the great pizza, and relaxing atmosphere. I loved the ambiance and architecture of the interior as well!"}
{"text":"Lucille, you feel too cool for Madison. it really feels and tastes like a *big city* restaurant. the wood fired pizzas are amazing (chewy/soft crust/interesting-fresh ingredients). personally, I love hating on merchant, but Lucille has changed my tune. OH AND THERE IS A LOUNGE INSIDE THE ORIGINAL SAFE (building was a bank in the 1890s)--it's easily one of the coolest things in Madison. all the haters, plz go to the old fashioned (& cry into your cheese curds) and leave me and Lucille in peace."}
{"text":"So we came for a date night during the \"Miracle on King Street\" promotion. The restaurant was super festive and fun! Even the cocktail list was holiday themed! Our server was super accommodating and nice! Shout out to Josh! We got the steel pan pizza which was so good! It was an awesome hybrid between almost Detroit style and Chicago style pizza. It definitely scratched my itch for Chicago style pizza. I will definitely be back to try some of their wood fired pizza and other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"We tried Lucille after walking by and seeing how cool it looked. Unfortunately, that cool look translates to horrendous acoustics - you could barely hear the person beside you, much less the person across from you.

The waitress was nice, though she inexplicably kept calling my husband Patrick - when she asked if that was his name, he answered \"no\" and she clearly couldn't hear him. 

The food was good, though there is better pizza in town (Pizza Brutta, Salvatore's). The harvest salad was tasty. The Caesar salad had croutons so hard they were almost inedible. Overall, we decided we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had (The Queen/margherita) and the autumn salad with walnuts/apples was so good."}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting the market on a Saturday morning and had a really good experience.
I was lucky enough to sneak in right before the lunch crowd started filing in, so we got a good table and friendly server with time to help me and my toddler settle down.

Then I ordered a pizza and a small meatballs appetizer with the idea of sharing both with the toddler. The pizza I chose was the simplest one: tomato sauce, no cheese and a bit of arugula. I loved it! The sauce is well balanced with just spicyness to make your mouth tingle, but not so much to light a fire, a bit of sweetness and a nice guilty/spicy note coming from the olive oil. I would have made it a tad less sweet, but I know I'm in the minority's there. The spicy was a bit much for the toddler: she tasted the sauce and made all sorts of funny faces after which she decided to stick to the crust. Which was also good: thin, crispy, chewy and with some smokiness coming from the burnt dough blisters.

I found the meatballs more forgettable. They were good, but not special. They had some nice porky notes as if they had bacon or sausage in the mix, but I found them a tiny bit under flavored. Might have been salt or the wrong mix of spices, there was just something missing.

We ended up at around $16 which I thought was pretty fair. But I do agree with some of the reviews that though some of the pizzas were overpriced!

Anyway, planning to go back with husband possibly to try the steel on pizza (sadly not available at lunch)"}
{"text":"We came here with some friends before a show at the Capitol Theater.  I was definitely impressed with the space that Lucille has, and the host brought us upstairs to be seated.  We decided to try the two of the specials, Corn and Bacon and the Belgian.  The Corn and Bacon had corn, bacon, shishitos peppers and piquillo peppers.  This pizza was amazing!  The Belgian had apples, brussels sprouts, bacon, Mornay sauce, and cave aged white cheddar.  To be honest, I think this was as good as the Corn and Bacon.  Also, the crust was amazing!  (These were both wood-fired pizzas).  My only regret was not taking pictures, and then it was all gone.  The server was very nice and attentive.  We will definitely be coming back, as this is now my favorite place for pizza.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Lucille's has a great location and the building is very unique however, the food and environment itself was particularly underwhelming. We ordered the guacamole ($14- kind of pricey) which was quite bland and we could tell it was not fresh and had been sitting in a refrigerator. Additionally, the restaurant was completely covered in Christmas decorations. And I'm talking the walls, the chairs, the music, the servers which really did not make me want to return. I am by no means a Scrooge but everything was just a bit much and I kept thinking about how they were limiting their customer clientele by going overboard with the decorations. If I felt uncomfortable as a celebrator of Christmas I am sure someone who doesn't celebrate that holiday would have felt very out of place. But The pizza itself was pretty good, I enjoyed the caramelized onion. I will give it another try however. Everyone deserves a second chance!"}
{"text":"Fantastic space. Everything else was just okay. Nothing bad but nothing excellent either. We came in on a weekday early evening and were seated right away at one of the long community tables. We sat down at ten to six and noticed that happy hour included 20% EVERYTHING (!!) until six. I'm always on the look out for a good deal so I quickly began perusing the menu in hopes that we would be ready to order when the server came over. Except that it took over 15 minutes to be greeted. Had I been a bit cranky, perhaps I would have pointed this out and insisted we receive the discount, but I wasn't cranky so I didn't. It was a gorgeous evening and was happy to be out of work early :) Did this impact my scoring of Lucille? Nope, not this alone. But the rough service continued throughout out our visit. Very inattentive and not the most friendly. The beer selection was decent but not a very wide variety of styles-very heavy on wheat beers and the such. Not much in terms of IPAs or pale ales. Yes I know it's light beer season but don't neglect us hop heads! We tried the veg-fest steel pan style. All the ingredients tasted super fresh but I was a bit put off by the cheddar cheese included in the crust. Just seemed a little odd given the flavor profile of the rest of the pizza. Perhaps parmesan or provolone would be a better choice? My bf was a big fan so we will probably be back but if left to me, I'd probably go elsewhere, especially when I need a pizza fix."}
{"text":"Came in around 6:30pm this Friday. Was told we would wait 45 min which wasn't a problem seeing that we anticipated that happening. I was pleasantly surprised when we were actually called after 10 minutes for our table. Started out with cheese curds which were excellent. I ordered the White Wedding pizza which I would also highly recommend. The decor is tastefully done and I love that it's two floors. They have amazing chandeliers and the bar looks awesome. The only negative was that it was a little expensive for just wood fired pizza and some curds."}
{"text":"Had a really pleasant time. The setting is modern, pretty bar downstairs. Very spacious. Great service. Pizza and salad came out nice and delicious. Price is really decent too. Music is a bit on the loud side but overall, perfect experience !"}
{"text":"Lucille was great -- I went for a late lunch on a weekday, so it wasn't busy. Tried a couple of pizzas and salad and fried green tomatoes.  It was all great -- I hadn't had fried green tomatoes like that in years.  I'll be back my next time in town."}
{"text":"I I'm very impressed with the location and the building. The two-story interior with the balcony is amazing, and the decor is modern, a little retro and nicely architectural.

I wish I could say the same about the service. Arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night and it took 15 minutes to place our order. 

The place was full, and we were offered three seats at the bar, which we took in order to move dinner along. My observation about the timing was that the bar area that we could directly observe was woefully understaffed, and the exotic drinks they serve take a particularly long time to create. 

In order to move things along, we ordered our drinks, appetizers and pizzas all at the same time. We asked the waitress if the pan pizza would take longer than the thin crust, wondering if they would be served one after another. She simply said that they would all be served at the same time. Whether it was cooking time or service, it took about 45 minutes for the pizza to arrive. We had to hurry to make it to an 8 o'clock show. 

I love the atmosphere, the pizzas were very delicious, and I'm not sure if I would return due to the very slow service."}
{"text":"Beautiful space (esp. 2nd floor seats with view of the Capitol), excellent food, good drinks. Really felt like an upscale, very hip place (would definitely bring friends from out of town), and glad that they have joined the Madison restaurant scene."}
{"text":"With the caveat that I have only been here once and I've only eaten the steel pan (Detroit style) pizza, I enjoyed it enough that I just can't hold it in. 

The crust was thick, but not heavy or dense or greasy and the edges were caramelized and shockingly delicious. I haven't had Detroit style before, so I don't know how it compares to its cousins. 

I haven't tried their wood fired pizzas and I don't know how I ever will at this rate.

Also had a plantain desert with caramel and coconut ice cream that was also surprisingly good and much lighter than I expected. 

Salvatore's is probably still my favorite pizza in Madison, but Lucille's steel pan is definitely going in my rotation. 

That caramelized crust, though."}
{"text":"I went to Lucille's upon a recommendation from a friend. The ambiance is bar like. I am not a drinker so I was not impressed by that.  I ordered a pizza and a salad. BTW, their prices are exorbitantly high. Now I don't mind paying for good, tasty and plenty. I didn't feel that was the case here with the salad they were skimpy with the dressing and the pizza although the crust was good the mozzarella on the pizza was like a glob on top which hardened. It was little food for the price and not fulfilling at all. Plus it's a bar and I still have to pay a service charge.  Will not be going back here. Next time I will just go to my favorite place Pizza Brutta."}
{"text":"The South Paw pizza is where it's at! You HAVE to try it. Even if you're a vegetarian, ask for it without the chicken and it'll still be amazing."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service ever. I have walked in twice, sat at bar in restaurant not even nearly full (not even 1/4 capacity) bartender barback and waiter just speaking to each other tell me they'll be there in a minute and kept talking for five, so I walked out. Second time I sat at bar in silence for 7 minutes before I walked out without an employee saying a word to me. I don't think I've ever written a review before for any reason. The foods probably decent I wouldn't know, because the training of the staff and the management is too atrocious to get me back in the door."}
{"text":"Another great spot for adults.  Really cool place - upscale - classy - uptown kind of place.  Not cheap but fine stop.  Holding back on 5 stars for food sampling.   Bar tending was impressive, not always easy to find in Madison.  Beer selection interesting - cocktails too!   Open and light - great addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Food is okay... but you really can't complain with free pizza at 4pm on fridays. If you are looking for a food rec here, the cookie pizza is my rec ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance, great nachos and pizza!!!! And a surprise capitol view. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Madison for two years and this has been the best meal an experience so far. Great pizza, beer, and service!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon and it was empty which was to be expected. It's a great venue. They have two floors and they can easily accommodate a large group if needed.

They have a good selection of pizzas. You can do steel pan pizza or wood duress wood fire is when they cook it in their wood fire over downstairs that is easily visible.

We got the five cheese wood-fired pizza for $19. It was thin crust. It's so good! I normally eat my pizza with meat but this was amazing. This was 14\". With two people, you can easily split it and we had two slices left over. It was cheesy but wasn't too cheesy that everything was spilling out. It was a bit soggy though. 

The service was good. They are really friendly but also very nonchalant. Our waitress didn't really smile or anything. She was just there. It wasn't bad but wasn't great either. She did write on our leftover box what kind of pizza and the date so that was cute.

I would recommend this place and come back again. I would try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like Lucille more than I do.  The building is very cool, the interior is really cool, and the beer list is great.  The food I just need to be a little better.  We came in on Saturday night and were told it was a 1.5 hour wait for 4 people.  Can't blame the wait on a popular place!  We had a few drinks at the bar and once we sat (it was more like an hour) we had a nice booth upstairs.  We ordered nachos and pizza....and while both were good, they weren't great.  I'll keep coming here because I am going to continue to want to like it and there are no places downtown like it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, a little dry.  Hard to justify $16 for a small pie.   Wings were well breaded.  But the blue cheese was runny and not thick.  Asked about the late menu options and didn't receive a clear answer.   Apparently the late night menu is a work in progress. Service needs to be fine tuned for the prices and nice build out.  Ordered a press and was delivered a Sierra Mist.  There was no host to greet us for a minute when we walked in on a Wednesday. .  I think this probably makes a good night club with food as a 2nd option.   I like my pizza Brutta or Salvatore's pizza in Madison"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I agree with another reviewer who said this place feels too cool for Madison. In love with the downstairs lounge and vault room with the old timey juke box and the fab Capitol views upstairs. The wood-fired pizza and steel-pan pizza are what heaven is made of and the salads are well seasoned and satisfying.  This is definitely my new go-to spot on the square.  
There is an extensive tap list and the bar has this urban tiki vibe and fun bartenders. RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I went to Lucille with some friends for dinner and drinks, and it was AMAZING!  The environment is so fun, we especially liked having drinks in the old bank vault after dinner. We all shared a wood fired pizza, steel pan pizza, and nachos.  I wasn't able to decide which I liked best, because they were all delicious.  The drinks were fun, creative, and as equally delicious as the food.  We will definitely be returning.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So I'm in town for business training and my instructor mentions this \"pop-up Christmas bar\" at Lucille and I decided to check it out. Not only was it festively decorated from top to bottom for Christmas, playing my fav holiday tunes, with super sweet and friendly staff; and terrific Christmas themed cocktails, but it also turns out that they make the BEST pizza I have ever eaten: the Unami. Not sure exactly what they put it in but its hard to believe it's legal ;). Trent was my waiter and he took excellent care of me and I couldn't have had a nicer time, well except maybe if my family had been with me. I will definitely be back. THANK YOU."}
{"text":"A fun, unique newer pizza place in town. We had one of the thin crust pizzas which was delicious with pancetta and Brussels sprouts, as well as once of the steel pan pizzas. You guys, you have to try the steel pan pizzas. The crust is made with Spotted Cow (go WI!), and the entire perimeter of the pan is lined with shredded cheese before the crust goes in, making every edge crunchy and delicious with crispy cheese. And the old fashioned wasnt half bad either"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and really nice staff. Maybe suffers from a bit of Try Too Hard Hipster. The food itself has been ok. One great find - the patacones. Haven't seen those anywhere in Madison other than here."}
{"text":"Really great space on two levels with the upper level overlooking the Capitol, creative drinks (after all, it is from the folks at Merchant), and a good vibe.

Tried the deep-dish Detroit-style pizza. Was pretty decent, but could have been a lot better in a couple ways. The cheese, toppings, and crust were great, but the addition of the caramelized cheddar around the edges was not a hit for me. It ended up having a weird burnt, salty, off taste to it. Also, the sauce suffered from being garlicy and somewhat bitter. A brighter, slightly sweeter sauce would have been perfect. Fixing both of these things would definitely add a star, but I'll definitely be back to try the wood-fired pizza."}
{"text":"Lucille was the venue for our private event (a wedding). The event coordinator was very thorough, dedicated, and had good attention to detail. She thought of and planned out every possible snag.The space is so beautiful already that no decorating is necessary.
It is Lucille's normal standard that the bartenders be very attentive and skilled at making delicious cocktails, and they did not disappoint. The food was AMAZING.

If you're thinking of hosting a private event, consider Lucille. It was a stress-free experience, everyone on staff worked toward making it a fun, boozy, smooth, delicious day, and they succeeded.

Also go there for cocktails, dancing, and pizza if you're not in the market for an event space."}
{"text":"Madison should just be labeled Pizza Town at this point. There are so many options. Lucille is shooting for that higher-end feel (think Graze) and trendy.

The place is definitely gorgeous inside and provides a wonderful ambiance. The upstairs overlooking the bar and the windows provide a wonderful eye candy while you wait and talk. Service was decent; nothing special and nothing horrible. 

Beer list is well done and provides a good mix of local WI beers and other up and coming breweries from the mid-west. I was pretty excited to see a few Michigan choices. My Wife had a painkiller mixed drink and a shooter daiquiri.

Pizza was, as best I can describe it, wood-oven napoli style. Flavourful and lots of interesting choices. My wife and I split 2 of them so we could sample. We ended with a pizza cookie which was difficult to eat due to being a cake pan??? I'd recommend against this if eating alone as you will burn yourself. It wasn't anything special. Think those big cookies you get in malls with some ice cream.

My rub is:
- 2 Beers
- 1.25 Mixed drink
- 2 smallish, and nothing spectacular, pizzas
- A cookie and ice cream scoop
TOTAL: 71 USD without tip

71 dollars blows my mind. I always tip 20% unless there is a huge fiasco so out the door for 2 we ended up around 85 bucks. For 85 dollar pizza I expect to forget I am in Wisconsin and harken back to my days growing up in Sicily or for a dancing clown to perform magic tricks while I eat. I just can't for the life of me bring myself to skip one of the more economical choices for this one. I wouldn't turn it down if going out with friends, but I am not sure the wife and I will add it to our standard rotation of places."}
{"text":"Taking into consideration we had a group of nine and it was a busy Friday night, I still felt the service was slow.  They definitely did not have enough waitstaff. Our waitress was nice though and had no problem breaking the bill into separate checks.  The food was decent but looked better than it tasted, burgers are small with no sides and I couldn't get it cooked the way I wanted so it was somewhat dry.  I might try them again on a night that isn't as busy to see if things are better."}
{"text":"Here is another time when I wish for that extra half star...not quite a five but darn close.

It was a Friday night, my 24 yr old son and I were doing dinner so we decided to try this place we both have walked by but never had gone in.

The wait was 40 minutes (Friday night at 6:30...no surprise) so they took our name and downstairs to the lounge we went.  

I loved the downstairs lounge. A bit dark, music a bit loud (they played Pearl Jam three times while we were down there according to my son). The bartender was busy but very quick and attentive.  The beer draft selection was a great variety and did not disappoint.  I really liked the atmosphere and will go back just to sit there.  

The 40 minute wait turned into a 65 minute wait hence the drop of a half star ( plus the price is a little high). We each order a pizza with a whole bunch of stuff on it.  These pizzas were definitely single serve but plenty for one person full of great beer.  The taste of the pizza?  It was Wicked Pissah( as my Boston tribe would say) which means awesome.  Easily the best tasting pizza I have had in my six years in Wisconsin.  It is a thicker pizza but has a very crisp crust with a slight garlic flavor. Plenty of sauce and toppings while an extra dollop of sauce on top well used on the edge crust pieces for dipping.

Oh for for the long wait the server gave us each a free beer of our choice.

I will be back. My son will be back. You should try."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Lucille's since they've opened. Our first visit went really bad and we ended up walking out with her parents. We gave it a few weeks and decided to give it one more try. We were glad we did because the Market salad was amazing along with the Queen pizza. Service however was still horrendous. We've now been for lunch and dinner during the week and on weekends for a total of 10+ visits. The Market salad and Queen pizza had always kept us coming back despite the quality of service fluctuating each time. Recently we went back for the same Market salad and found that the dressing was drastically different and different in a bad way. The original dressing is what made the salad! I have to say this is the straw that broke the camels back, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend one night and shared a cheese pizza with some Moscow mules. It was Monday and every drink that starts with M is half off. My friend and I loved everything, especially the stiff Moscow mules! Service was just ok, I would have like him to be a little more attentive. Young college guy who didn't really wanna be there.  The owners of merchant opened this place I believe, well done!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that our waiter was an absolute darling. He was the best part. 

The bathroom (upstairs) was clean.

Here's my beef:

1. Happy hour ended at 5:00pm. WTF is that?!  Ahem, anyone who is out of work by 5pm is already happy enough--it's those of us poor slobs who can't get there until AFTER 5pm who really need a happy hour. Two demerits, Lucille.

2. My bill came out to $30 (after gratuity). I ordered one (count 'em, ONE) drink (the Diablo) and the most inexpensive pizza on the menu (the Queen). I was very curious about the crust. For what I got, adjusted against all of the other amazing pizza and drinks in town, I'd say it wasn't worth $30.

3. Regarding the crust: correct me if I'm wrong here--isn't \"New Glarus Spotted Cow fermented crust,\" just another way of saying, \"we use the spent grains from a brewery's brewing process for our crust?\" I mean, I'm all for recycled anything, but paying a premium for this?  Nope.

So here's the deal: if you're a hipster man, trying to impress a hipster lady, or you've got money to burn and no time/experience to go off the beaten path for pizza, by all means, enjoy.

If you really like food and don't care about being seen in your fancy new fedora in an old bank vault while you drink $14 non-happy-hour-priced drinks, I'd say go somewhere else. Natt Spil's better anyway."}
{"text":"I have to say that our bartender was one of the best in the business. Unbelievably attentive, crafted a couple of cocktails that were exactly to our taste and gave us suggestions on what to see in Madison. I'm of the belief that service is just as if not more important than product or atmosphere, and our bartender knocked it out of the park. Tyler, if you see this- you made our entire night!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ambiance and interior design of Lucille. The bartenders at the main bar are very nice, busy - yet try their best to be attentive. Unfortunately, any time we've been upstairs, service has been horrible to the point where we don't even try anymore. Looking forward to trying again once the business has been up and running for a little longer.

Cocktails though.. yum!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and it was truly packed. 1.5 hour wait starting at 7:30. 

Was the wait worth it? Meh, not really. 

I really love the decor of place! It's so beautiful inside!! 

We ordered the veg fest and the meat lovers I think. They first mistook our order of the veg fest for the sausage fest and had to redo the order. Should maybe thinking about differentiating those names.

Also Ordered the Airmail Cocktail and it was delish!

I would come back here for the bar but not the food especially with that wait time."}
{"text":"Food: Super amazing. Honestly anyone that gives a bad review of the food is just full of shit. 

Building: gorgeous 

Service: Swift and to the point, couldn't ask for more. 

Lounge: dark, but a cool place to wait until a table opened with a good selection."}
{"text":"Oh Lucille's I wish I could give you 5 stars, I really do but can't. The atmosphere is very modern and perfect for downtown Madison. Pizza is one of my favorite foods too. I've been here twice and this review is mostly in regards to my last visit (yesterday, a Monday night). The specials and happy hours are decent and unique to the restaurant. If you plan to eat here take a look at the daily specials/happy hour before you come.

Pizza - My BF and I decided to split a steel pan pizza prior to attending a concert at the Majestic. We ordered the Pepperoni & Onion pizza. The pizza came out hot, on a round pan. The best part of the pie was the caramelized cheese crust surrounding the outside of the pizza. We both agreed the sauce was over the top. To me it tasted more like spaghetti sauce not a pizza sauce. It had sauce in between the cheese and crust then poured overtop. I ended up scraping the extra sauce off the pizza. I think the pizza would be much better with less sauce, and more of a basic sauce. It over powered the pizza. 

The serving size was plenty for 2 people I was full off of 1 1/2 slices. We had two slices left over that we could have taken home but since we were attending a concert after we opted to not take the leftovers. 

Drinks - Monday's special was 50% off any craft cocktail that starts with a letter M. Our server stopped right away to take our drink orders and mentioned the special. Asked if we wanted mojitos, Moscow Mules, and one other drink. I opted for a mojito, and my BF ordered a beer. Drinks were served quickly. My mojito was not good at all, tasted like it was a premixed drink, with a sprig of mint as a garnish. The mint was not muddled at the bottom. Disappointing to say the least, at least the presentation was nice? My 2nd drink I opted for the Mule and that was very tasty. 

Lastly - The server was very nice and quick with getting us our bill as we mentioned we had a show to see. When the bill arrived I about fell out of my chair the bill was $75!!! We only ordered a pizza $19, a beer $10($), and two cocktails that were $9 & $10 but 50% off.. After looking over the bill we noticed an extra pizza and another food item was added. We brought that up with our server who corrected the issue."}
{"text":"Just went to Lucille's for the first time and was very impressed. We sat at the community table which definitely seemed like the way to go. It was the closest to the windows and we were able to get some fresh air. The nachos were amazing!! And I mean amazing! I know what you're thinking, it's just nachos, but these were honestly the best I've had in Madison. The mushroom and black garlic pizza was also incredible and was very satisfying. Would I call it the best pizza in Madison? No. But it was delicious, had a great vibe, and will be fun place to continue to experience. I'll definitely be back and next time maybe check out more of the bar menu."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a late Sunday night only to find out that they ran out of most of their steel pan pizza other than veg fest (olives, mushrooms, bell pepper, spinach.  As the dough needs to proof, it's best to arrive early to ensure they don't run out.  Always a creative couple, my girlfriend and I ordered one and had them top it with sausage while another party in the group topped theirs with pepperoni.  Overall, I'm a big fan of their pizza.  Their crust (fermented with spotted cow beer) is lined around the edges with cheddar and that by itself would keep me coming back.  It's something truly unique and utterly delicious.  I thought the toppings were on point but the sausage was rather dull and lacked the fennel, hot pepper flakes, oregano that makes up a good italian sausage.  On the flip side, the pepperoni paired excellently with the rest of the vegetables.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The space (two stories with a basement) is light and airy.  Definitely a place I will be coming back to."}
{"text":"There are certain things I love at Lucille. Things I love: 

1) Cheese Curds
2) Black Garlic & Mushroom \"BGM\" Wood-Fired Pizza
3) Potato Wood-Fired Pizza
4) Bar downstairs in the bank vault

Things I don't love:

1) The wait and service
2) The price tag on the pizzas

Lucille has some pretty delicious pizzas and some that are not as good (the White Wedding was unimpressive). The service is also painfully slow. I came here for lunch one Wednesday and the restaurant was completely empty and it took our table forever to get our pizzas and the bill. Our lunch took over an hour because service was slow. Come here on a Friday or Saturday night and be prepared to wait over an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"I have used Yelp for restaurant recommendations for years although I have never taken the time to post a review, until tonight. I want to preface that I have worked in the service industry as a bartender the past seven years and know how to differentiate between good service, poor service, service that is slower because of high volume, and service that is slow because the person doesn't give a shit. I am in town visiting from California and stopped in tonight. First of all, LOVE the Christmas decorations! But I feel the need to write this because the service was great tonight. The bartenders (Sarah was our main server) were attentive, welcoming, and even polite when I was the annoying tourist who asked her to take our group's picture while she was busy working. But the reason I am compelled to write this is because there was a jerk (let's be honest, he was an asshole) next to us who was unbelievable rude to the bartender Sarah and made a scene raising his voice at her. First off I commend her because she was ten times more professional than I would have been lol. But I just wanted to write this review in her defense because I'm sure this idiot will rush home to write a Yelp review. So in case this guy writes a review, any future customers, and management: service, food, and drinks were amazing. Sarah was great and the guy was a douche canoe. I hope he reads this and learns some manners. Merry Christmas"}
{"text":"Review is only for atmosphere and bar. One of the pricier places on state street with an older crowd on a Saturday night, but it's a perfect atmosphere for chatting casually with friends and colleagues and allows you to avoid the undergrad crowd in the area. Drinks are decent and are around $7 each.  There is a lovely candlelit ambience and a DJ playing."}
{"text":"We got the brunch pizza and the bottom of the pizza was burned, ruining the taste of the entire pizza and delicious toppings on top.  Interior and restaurant ambiance is adorable. Would try again but the burnt taste was a total turn off."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, delicious crafty pizzas and fun drink specials (tonight was 50% off any cocktail starting with an M)."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but really enjoyed it.  The pan pizza is unlike anything I've ever had and quite tasty.  The space is fantastic.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice space. Huge and very open. Really easy to get to the bar because it juts out into the space. But getting a bartenders attention is another ordeal. It gets kind of crowded late night and has a rap vibe. At least the DJ on Sunday night was spinning a bunch of rap. That said, they are booming on Sunday night. So that's a plus. They're really the only one downtown that is still going that late."}
{"text":"As a wood fired pizza aficionado I was stoked when I read this place had opened. Went on a busy afternoon, had a beer that was too expensive for the small pour (maybe 6-7 oz out of a snifter.) my fault though, took a gamble on a beer I'd never heard of from one barrel that I read off their beer list wall. 

As for their pizza, I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars. Ordered a margherita, the cheese and sauce had come to be one in the center and it produced a bit of a sog in the center and a limp crust when eaten. The taste was great despite the difficulty in trying to eat it at the bar. The crust had the appearance of classic American Neapolitan style pizza, the crust rim big puff without the classic high temp char. Dough had a bit of a tougher texture than I'd imagine in a fine neopolitan pizzeria, not enough to never go back, but definitely not eliciting the epic pizza feeling I crave of perfect pizza. I'll go back in a few months to see how things are progressing with their dough."}
{"text":"If you're not taking advantage of Lucille's check-in offer you're missing out - it's might be the best in town. The daiquiri is really delicious and hand-crafted; you won't be getting a sweet slushy here.

I went to Lucille shortly after it opened and it wasn't the best experience - the food was good, but service was not and timing was ridiculous. I've grabbed takeout a couple of times and been happy and recently have returned once for lunch and once for dinner to dine in. Happy to report that they've gotten into their groove. 

The pizzas are expensive, and I've found the best deal usually comes by eating in a group and getting a mix of wood-fired and steel pan pizzas. I vastly prefer the wood-fired, but the crust on the steel pans is killer. The nachos are also amazing and a small order was enough for two full meals for just me or to split between five of us for an appetizer. 

The decor is beautiful and the space has been well designed, seamlessly moving from a bright and airy noontime eatery to a cozy dinner spot to bumpin' club at night. The vault downstairs is great for private events, and I'm looking forward to their transformation this winter into a holiday theme bar with several others around the country."}
{"text":"Lucille has great ambience . This is 2nd time we've been there - first time was great. Last night pizza delivered almost burnt- no serving utensil for pizza; the waitress was on her phone in the back; never came to see if we needed anything ( like 2nd drink) and we had to flag her down to get bill and box for our burnt pizza . Too bad - cause I like the atmosphere- but my husband won't go back. If you get a good server than probably a good experience. We should have sent pizza back but we couldn't find our server."}
{"text":"Welcome to the New Crown Jewel of Madison.

I've been here for lunch, dinner, and late nite lounging with the cream of society. In a place that feels like it belongs in New York, I've mixed it up with artists, entrepreneurs, musicians, politicians, designers, young and mature professionals, and the beautiful single people of the city making eyes with everyone. I've never seen a cooler crowd come together in Madison.

This place is packed, all the time, for a reason. 

Every detail, from the decor, crust, and cocktails has a craft to it. It's attracting the passionate creators of the city because you can see, taste, and hear that every part of it is being delivered with passion and a dedication to a total sensory vibe.

Motown music is humming enough to keep your head bobbing but not to loud to talk. The food is signature, farm fresh, and delicious. It's a good thing they serve the pizza cookie with spoons and not forks because you'd stab your dates hand to have another bite.

I've read a few of the negative reviews that people have posted days after the place opened, which I believe is unfair. Most restaurants open like secret nobody wants to hear and have time to iron out the kinks for a year. This brand new staff and kitchen opened to a flood gate of people and have been keeping there heads above water in non stop hour lines. The food and service has gotten better every time I've come and in a year it will be the naysayers favorite spot, if they can get in."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I got the Lucille Burger and - no joke - it was the best burger I've had in Madison. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"awful bartender service. spend your money somewhere else.. 15min to get a drink and the bar wasnt that busy."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza - the steel pan was awesome and unlike anything I've ever had. The salt and vinegar chips didn't really taste like anything at all, but overall our service was great. Awesome decor and vibe too! Don't forget to head down to the Lounge in the basement for a cocktail in the safe!"}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) gluten free friendly*
2) good food
3) great atmosphere 
*g free crust was supposed to arrive the next day we were there

Stopped in to Lucille on the first night they were serving their full menu! The space on the square is AWESOME. The location is great and the interior is super trendy. The huge windows can all be opened to let in fresh air. The three story space is made up of the bar and communal dining on the first floor, booths and tables on the second, the downstairs is where you can see the old bank vault from the original building! I think they do cocktails down there as well? 

We expected that Lucille would be busy and they were! They will give you the wait times for the communal dining space (for us this was 10 minutes) and the private dining space (for us this was 45 mins). We opted for communal dining! The communal dining space is basically a long table and you get X amount of seats. If you really hate dining next to people, probably not for you but we thought it was fun. 

We ordered some drinks at the bar while we were waiting. We found the drinks to be pretty overpriced for Madison. The HOUSE wine was around $8 and my fiancé got a beer from One Barrel (Madison Brewery) that was around $7. $15 for a tap beer and house wine is a bit steep in Wisconsin. 

Service was friendly but a little slow. Giving Lucille the benefit of the doubt as this was their first night with the full menu. I had been DYING to try their pizza as I had scoured the menu on their FB page and saw they had gluten free crust! You can do gluten free crust for the wood fired pizza but not the square Detroit style pizza. However, when I placed my order the server said they didn't have the gluten free crust in and this was expected to arrive the next day. Sad!!! While the gluten free crust gives people with celiac disease a lot of options the lack of leaves you scouring the menu. They have some salads, but since I can't seem to ever eat a healthy dinner, I decided on the large portion of the pork belly nachos! The server warned me this was big but I was up for the challenge. My fiancé settled on the pepperoni and red onion Detroit style pizza. HOLY COW THE WAITRESS WASN'T LYING THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE. My nachos were probably enough to feed four, and my fiancée's pizza was enough to serve two at least. This is good however considering both items were around $17/$18. The Detroit style pizza had six slices which was enough for a full meal and plenty of leftovers. It may cool in the future to see a smaller pizza size emerge on the menu. If you are there with a few people and want to try different pizzas you will have a ton of leftovers and a pretty hefty bill which could be prevented with a smaller size offering. All that aside, the food rocked. The nachos were great and being served on corn chips makes this a great g free entree or appetizer. Pizza was great too! 

Lucille is an awesome addition to the downtown neighborhood. I look forward to coming back and finally getting my hands on that g free mushroom and garlic pizza!"}
{"text":"I love the aesthetic of Lucille because of its dramatic two-story layout and hip vibes. They are always changing up their menu and experimenting with new things, so I feel like I have a new experience each time I go. 

In terms of their main focus - pizza - I really enjoy their wood fired options. They allow you to customize, and there are a lot of premium ingredient options, so you can really make a delicious pizza to your liking. 

I, however, was not a huge fan of their steel pan pizza. It felt like a weird rendition of Chicago deep dish, and as a Chicago native, it just tasted too intense and overdone. The cheese crust was a bit overpowering in flavor and there was way too much of it.

Anyways, I would stick to their cocktails and thin crust pizzas! It's a fun place to go with friends in the city."}
{"text":"Pizza is very yum. Drinks are pretty just as the rest of the pizza parlor. Staff is very attentive and smartly dressed. Overall service is on par with the finest epicurean epicenters of Europe. I wish they upgraded the internet though because it was really hard to stream Fuller House at the table so I had to watch downloaded episodes of will and grace instead. The cookie tastes like the dreams of a thousand orphans."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away!
We came in to celebrate our anniversary with some drinks and appetizers, very simple. And our server Trent was absolutely incredible. Answered all of our questions, was courteous and polite, was very knowledgeable about the menu, and held great conversation. But what put him over the edge was bringing us a complimentary dessert and sips of champagne since we were celebrating. It really made the night that much more special. 
Even besides that, the restaurant itself was just our style. We loved the atmosphere. Although we were lucky enough to get the table by the balcony doors upstairs, I believe that any seat in the restaurant would've been great. Lots to look at in the restaurant, great views of the capital and downtown, and good music selection. And even though we came in on a Friday night, it was not terribly loud or obnoxiously full of people. 
Overall we had a great time coming here and can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely rubbish cocktails!! I have been here twice and been really disappointed with the drink menu.. n the food ain't great either!! Overpriced , overhyped! Just a waste of money!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lucille four times, and 3/4 experiences were great. The time that wasn't so great, I was just there for drinks in the bank vault lounge, and service was very slow, but I'm overlooking it because the bartender said they were down a cocktail waitress, and the other times were great. 

Lucille has two types of pizza: wood fire and steel pan. I've only had the wood fire because it is my favorite style of pizza. I found it to be very good and made with fresh ingredients. Other menu highlights are the nachos and daiquiri shooters.

The part about Lucille that stands out the most is the decor: truly outstanding. The brick has been restored, the space is open, and the views of the Capitol dome can't be beat. Also, how cool is a lounge in an old bank vault?! There is also a walk up window for street-side service. 

Tip: Wednesday is cheap date night-$40 gets you a salad, pizza, dessert and a bottle of sparkling wine for two."}
{"text":"The building is beautiful. But you pay for it in the food. Unfortunately the food is not particularly great (especially for what you're paying) 12 dollars or so for an extremely salty procutto pizza with no sauce for one. The bar selection seemed good, and thry had a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Super tasty pizza. Nuff said."}
{"text":"A group of 9 of us visited Lucille recently on a Sunday at 6pm. We were seated right away and the staff was attentive and our server was very friendly and shared her favorites from the menu. We ordered salt & vinegar chips and nachos for an appetizer. The chips could've been great, but were slightly on the well done side giving them a subtle burnt taste. The nachos were tasty. A friend of ours ordered a fresh mozzarella and basil pizza and was underwhelmed. The fresh mozzarella was plentiful, but it looked and she said it tasted like there wasn't any basil on the pizza. Her husband found a long hair baked into his crust. Gross! They did make him a new pizza. Overall, I would say that the location and design of the space is great. There's potential here if they bring the quality of the dishes up to meet the quality of the space. At present, the food isn't worth the visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on a whim. The interior is very industrial chic, what with the exposed brick, steel pipes and dim lighting. Bartenders are on point with the cocktails. Comparisons to the late Jolly Bob were made. Cocktails are pricey but pack a punch. Will come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday in December for the free pizza.  Normally, I'm not one to complain about service, as I've been a server in the past myself, but our waiter was exceptionally rude and seemed clueless about the menu.  He neglected to tell us that during the month of December, the normal drink menu is nonexistent, and that he didn't know what the happy hour deals were.  That all would have been fine if he had even given us the time of day-I suspect he thought we were underagers, as Lucille is notorious for not carding (even though we were all 21.) Besides our waiter, the rest of the staff seemed like they didn't want to deal with our group (of only three people at 4 in the afternoon, I might add.) We were told that we had to sit upstairs for some unknown reason, even though there were multiple tables open on the bottom floor, and essentially that we had 1 hour to eat and then leave, since they were booked up with reservations at 5.  We definitely didn't need more time than that, and obliged, but it truly seemed like the staff did not want to serve us/ deal with us at all.  The pizza was good, but nothing I'd pay the absurdly high prices for if it wasn't free.  The cocktail my friend ordered was a whopping $12 and served in the tiniest glass I've ever seen.  One thing I do like about Lucille is that the vibe is very sophisticated, and the décor is really cute; I really, truly wanted to like this place, but unfortunately, the insane price tags for mediocre food, and the condescending staff is really deterring me. This restaurant needs to get off its high horse."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to check out! Our server Trent was always attentive and did well making sure we were always taken care of. They're only five days old but the staff is already killing it. I had the nachos and the mozzarella and basil wood-fired pizza. Both were delicious. The drinks are mostly rum based, which is not a problem with me. The hotel nacional is a must have! Overall I'm extremely excited to experience more of the drinks, food, atmosphere & fun that this place has to offer."}
{"text":"They recently updated their pizza menu and it's a nice improvement. We tried the n'duja want a date and it was delicious. I think they've increased the size of the pie and the crust had a nice chewy/crunch to it. Toppings were delightful as well with the sweetness of the dates and the saltiness of the meat."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!!  The building itself has a lot of character, and the decor they chose compliments it so well.  The food and drinks are stellar and unique.  You can't beat the location and the view of the Capitol Building out the corner window.  I love the 2 story concept, which allows you to look down on the bar and stone pizza oven when you sit above.  My kids loved watching the chef cook pizzas!

It's family friendly or a great place to meet a group of friends.  The service was excellent too.  I can't wait to show this place to our friends and family when they visit Madison!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after Art Fair on the Square and what a stumble it was. Amazing service, GORGEOUS location (love the open air quality) and OMG the food! The cheese curds were divine, the guac platter made me swoon (and it was even good the next day as leftovers) the pizzas were ridiculously good and so were the fish tacos. Yeah we ate a lot. It's spendy but worth it for a night out. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came here two times on my last Work trip because it was a holiday bar (ok mostly Christmas) I had a wonderful time buying holiday themed drinks and enjoying my time there.

I didn't try any of the food here but someone got nachos and they looked amazing. I wish we had gotten something.

I got an iced hot coco and a mulled wine. Both were excellent but cost $12z"}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun! Not only is the food great, but so is the staff and general ambiance. I highly recommend going for their \"Cheap Date Night\" on a Wednesday, but make reservations! It's a great deal: $40 for a bottle of bubbly, a salad, a pizza, and a dessert to all split between two people. 

We got the Umami pizza, and it was totally weird and awesome-- very unlike any other pizza I've ever had. We will definitely be coming back here to try more things soon!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Wood Fire/Steel pan pizza place in Madison! The atmosphere is cool and eclectic. The basement lounge is comfy cozy and cool in the old Bank Vault.

Back to the food. Best crunchy crispy wood fired crust. To die for.
Cannot wait to go back when the weather allows the doors to be open on all sides.

One small complaint, it took a while to get our first round of drinks, but after that, service was excellent."}
{"text":"In the top 3 pizza contenders in Madison! Go for the steel pan AKA Detroit style pizza, a pan pizza with cheese carmalized into the crust. The pizza is cheesy,  crusty in all the right places, and the tomato sauce is fresh and tasty. I highly ask for some extra on the side and I can have that be itself. It is the closest to real Detroit style in Wisconsin you will find anywhere in this state, please trust that I have been around, and sort of close to Nikki's in downtown Detroit's Greektown. 

Great pizza that is equally matched with an extensive craft beer draft list speckled with rare brews and extremely rare beers that bring people in chasing ultra rarities. I arrived for a Vietnamese coffee stout that I had been chasing for year only to find out the barrel had just kicked. I stayed for a the pizza and some similar beers! 

The music can get loud and if you are not into that don't go here after 8:00 p.m., especially on the second floor. I was the there with my parents one evening and it was blaring, like I said get there early if you want to hear across the table. 

Great place, the lunch special is a deal, great beer selection, craft cocktails are on point, and the waitstaff are awesome."}
{"text":"This was fine.  I tried a wood-fired pizza, and New York's Franny's it was not (although I also love Amorina).  Service was fine and prices were fair.  I came with a party of 3 and was able to be seated right away on a weekday night. I wouldn't be opposed to coming again, but I also wouldn't suggest it either."}
{"text":"5 stars the first time we were there. Tonight was 2nd night and we wanted a drink downstairs. 1 bartender who was slightly tipsy because it was his birthday and was having a few. 30+ people. Waited 20 minutes to be talked to. No wait staff. Empty drink glasses everywhere. For being the new hot and trendy what we experienced tonight would not bring us back. We told the hostess table as we left so we hope they make some changes."}
{"text":"Absolutely not impressed. Bartender seemed overwhelmed. Got a ton of foam on my stout that was served with a very very messy pour.

Definitely a place for the who is who of Madison. 

Perhaps if I'd been in that book, I would have gotten better service. 

You can't tell who is working, as the staff is not in any kind of uniform. The floor manager, from what I can tell is in a tank top and profusely sweating. Not cute, not hygienic and does not give me the impression she is confident in either her front of the house team or her back of the house team. 

I will return, but on a Monday or Tuesday afternoon; my review will be updated then."}
{"text":"Lucille's is my current favorite. I almost always get the Hotel National drink and whatever the pie of the week is. I've never been disappointed. Plus, the view out of the second story is incredible -- I got to watch the sun set over the capital building. Definitely recommend the cheese curds and fried green tomatoes, so good!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I just went there at a bad time, but it was really loud at dinner. I ate upstairs with my girlfriend and it felt like we were in a club. It was also a 30+ min wait and when we were seated it was half empty so I was a tad confused. Really really good pizza though. Can't remember what we had but the crust was just doughy enough and crispy at the same time. I'm a big service and atmosphere kind of guy... Would have given it 4 stars if not for that."}
{"text":"Hm Lucille is an interesting place - it tries to be upscale pizza, but the pizza really isn't THAT much better than some of the nearby competitors.

The reason I still give it 4 stars is the ambience, service, and location. The place is gorgeous! Huge high ceilings and lots of lighting and (oddly) club music. Makes for an interesting combination! They have a nice upper floor with great decor and lighting while the lower floor has the bar area and is always packed. 

The restaurant generally gets quite crowded for dinner, so I would prepare for that. This is a pretty perfect place for a Friday night out with a group of friends though! I would really not recommend this for an intimate dinner, since the music is pretty loud and the bar area is generally fairly loud as well.

Now don't get me wrong, the pizza is quite good! Its more expensive than other pizza places, but the decor should have led you to that conclusion. If you're looking for truly good pizza, I would suggest Grampa's on Willy! Comparable prices (much longer wait usually), but much more intimate setting and very good pizza."}
{"text":"Lucille got it going on. With three amazingly designed floors, great drinks and along with some off-the-chain noms, there's almost no place like it in Madison. Soft open was today and I got ya say, I'm impressed by the decore, food and service. Can't wait to have more to talk about."}
{"text":"I came back to Lucille for a Monday night date with my boyfriend! We were given a table by the window with a booth, which was super romantic and fun. 

Our server was amazing, very good about checking in and keeping a pace that wasn't too fast or drawn out.

We ordered cider and a Mexican firing squad cocktail to drink, followed by the Ahi Tuna Ceviche appetizer. For dinner, we split the Black Garlic and Mushroom pizza, and for dessert we tried (again) the cookie pie. 

Redeeming qualities: 
- THAT APPETIZER was seriously perfect, all around amazing. I would come back just to eat that by myself. Ahi Tuna was tender, the slaw was flavorful and citrus-y, and the root chips were super yummy. I loved that plate so much. 
- The pizza crust was crunchy and soft at the same time (somehow) and topped with a really great combo of rich and acidic flavors. Mushrooms, cheese, garlic, onions, and kale make my favorite winter dish, and this was all put on a pizza. 

I still liked the Mexican Firing Squad cocktail, but had it been full price (only half off on Mondays), I wouldn't have ordered it. I wish they used less ice (even soda water instead would be good) so there's more to drink. For $5.50 it was amazing, but for $11 it was very little. Not too spicy or sweet, and I recommend it even if you don't think you like tequila. 

I also think the cookie pie was improved since the last visit, which made me happy! Fundamentally it was exactly as described in the menu - a warm and cake-like cookie topped with creamy vanilla bean ice cream. The cookie was more like a dense cake, pretty warm, and much more moist than last time. I personally would have loved more chocolate in some way, like a drizzle or extra chips. It definitely would have made the whole thing taste more moist. The ice cream was Sassy Cow's, so it fit the Wisconsin standard perfectly. 

Overall, I am far and away more impressed with Lucille after the second visit. I would come back for wood-fired pizza, that ceviche dish, and ciders or beers. Cocktails are pricey but good with deals, and dessert was definitely improved. Service continued to impress, and we even got a chat with the chef this time, which was fun! I'd love to come back again and bring a group with me soon."}
{"text":"Tasty food, fun environment, great drinks. Service was solid. All around really good time hanging at Lucille. Recommend checkin' it out."}
{"text":"The ambiance, the brick and exposed ducts at Lucille are great. How we to wait an hour and a half for pizza?? Not great. Sure the pizza is ok, it tastes like Pizza Hut. We also had an over dressed Caesar salad for $6 EACH. Probably the worst was their pink Grigio  named SASS.  Do NOT ever drink this horrible wine: it's absolutely horrific."}
{"text":"So.. I ordered a long island iced tea and that was the absolute worst version of the cocktail I've ever had. There more ice in there than the chunk that broke off of Antarctica. Bloody disappointed. Don't be chintzy on the alcohol! 
Thanks Tara for reaching out. I had asked my friends to pay my tab. I guess they weren't served a bill. I appreciate the honesty and would come back to settle the bill and perhaps try a different drink. Cheers."}
{"text":"Just moved down the street and have been visiting bars and restaurants, trying to find places my boyfriend and I can be regulars at. I visited Lucilles tonight for the first time and had the worst experience. I have served for the past 10 years so I understand how everything works, especially in busy, chaotic times. By far WORST SERVICE EVER. Guy in blue button up and black earrings was so rude and my friends had said guy in the flat brimmed  hat was (and is) always awful when they go. Usually why they choose not to go here. Giving two stars because it was a super cool spot, esthetically ,and the one  girl was eventually came over and was smiling and friendly all night. But will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"This place is just perfect. The food, the ambiance, the drinks, the views...Everything is just stellar. 

Located just off the square, its location is hard to beat. What makes it even better though is the funky shape of the building in which it resides. The two story layout and large open windows make the impressive space feel even more open. With the windows open, a gentle breeze makes its way through the space and almost makes you believe that you're dining outside. The views of the capitol - not even a block away - are also second to none. 

Today I enjoyed a great lunch with friends. Our group started with their nachos and we all enjoyed the lunch special for only $10. I had the daily steel pan pizza special, made with spinach and mushrooms. It was nothing short of phenomenal. From the toppings and seasonings to the pillowy crust and crunchy cheese, it easily was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.

I've stopped here after dinner and the bar scene is equally impressive. Its a large, open bar area that works well for small groups or a nice date. The bar in the lower level also is a treat - offering a quirky seating area in what I believe was once a bank vault. 

Madison's restaurant scene is pretty impressive for a town of our size. That said, Lucille has quickly scored a spot on my shortlist of favorite hangouts. Lucille is without a doubt a fun place to grab an affordable lunch or have a fun night or with dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Have you ever been at a restaurant, still been hungry, but no one wants to finish eating or take the food home?  Yeah...that's Lucille's $22 mushroom pizza.  I did end up taking the leftovers home, but I didn't want to finish it the next day either!  lol  I was warned, strongly, against the larger pizzas, because they are, \"All dough\".  The pulled pork nachos had pickled onions on them that tasted like feet, and we did end up leaving those at the table.  I liked the pickled veggie appetizer!  That was good!!   I am not sure it was worth $7, but after a $60 bill for food no one wanted to finish, it was refreshing to have something to eat.  I picked out this resturant after reviewing the online menu, and this food was soooo disapointing."}
{"text":"I've only been when Lucille's in full holiday mode (went twice while in town for thanksgiving) but I thought they did a great job with the decor but especially the seasonal cocktail menu - really cute names from classic holiday movies and they were served in festive mugs. That being said, it feels like CHRISTMAS in there right now so maybe steer clear if that's not what you're going for. 

The first time, I only had drinks downstairs in the vault (very cool) and then once the upstairs loft type area cleared out of people having dinner, we moved up to a table there since we had a big group. The next time, four of us had two steel pan pizzas and all thought it was delicious (and were so stuffed). I'd be curious to try some of the other options but it does seem like they're trying to make pizza their focus. They gave us an envelope for a holiday raffle that you have to bring back in Jan/feb to see if you won -- again, 10/10 for the holiday branding/marketing."}
{"text":"Having visited Lucille twice in as many days, it's easy to say that Lucille will always have a little \"pizza\" my heart when I venture back to Illinois. From great appetizers, and mouth-watering pizza, to the great wait staff-including Dan, Lucille is definitely a must do for any pizza lover visiting the area."}
{"text":"Loud, overpriced, and what is with the bartenders here? Macho and rude. Thanks for deigning to serve me. Wow...

Why only rude male bartenders? Seems dumb from a business standpoint..."}
{"text":"Lucille's is a much welcomed addition to the Madison community. The atmosphere is very positive and warm, and the large bar offers a great space to grab a drink and chat. While it's a great casual place to go for a drink after a long day of work, it's also the perfect date spot. Wednesdays offer a $40 \"cheap date menu\", where 2 people share a pizza, a salad, a cookie skillet, and a bottle of champagne... simply a steal! However, although the wood fired pizza and insanely good cookie skillet are a strong pull, the only downside is the wait. Expect around an hour, especially on a date night... but know that the bubbly is coming soon."}
{"text":"The Christmas spirit is so strong here! The Christmas cocktails are creative and delicious. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"Yes. So much yes. We came here soon after it opened and were not impressed, but Lucille redeemed themselves. 
We came on Wednesday night, which is their \"Date Night Special\". You get a salad, a wood-fired pizza, dessert and a bottle of sparkling wine for $40. For the salad, we ordered the \"Italian Pantry Salad\". It was delicious--the best parts were the artichoke hearts and the mozzarella. For the wood-fired pizza, we ordered \"The Queen\". A classic type of vegetarian pizza - it was super good! Filling enough for two with some to take home as leftovers. For dessert, you can choose between the cookie pizza or key lime pie. We went with the cookie pizza -- super warm, decadent cookie that comes with a scoop of ice cream. And of course, the sparkling wine was super good too! 
The only thing that wasn't the best was the service -- but it wasn't awful considering it was a busier time for dinner. But to make up for that, their Yelp offer of a free beer, Moscow Mule or daiquiri is worth it! The Moscow Mule didn't disappoint (and I mean, it's free so that's a plus)."}
{"text":"The location is fairly large, for downtown Madison, with a sort of industrial feel. The host said there was a 45 minute wait for a table (they take your phone number and text when it is ready) so we headed downstairs to the bar/lounge area (there is also a large bar area on the main floor). It was really interesting with the lounge area being inside an old bank vault with a cushioned bench all the way around and several tables scattered about. I had a Sazerac, which was excellent. Our table was ready early and we headed back upstairs. Our visit was during Restaurant Week, so the menu options were a bit different/more limited than usual. I had a salad and then one of their wood fired pizzas. The pizza was very good, although I have to say not quite as good as Salvatore's (still my fav pizza in town, hands down). The services was great and I really enjoyed the vibe of the place. I would definitely give this place 4 stars for the service, decor/ambience and cocktails but the food, while good, wasn't quite 4 stars. 3.5 stars would be what I'd go with if I could give 1/2 stars. I'd definitely like to come back and try out their regular menu, and maybe add an extra star or two :)"}
{"text":"I like Lucille.  Their food is really good (I'm partial to the nachos and whatever seafood appetizer they have at the time).  Their table service is good, but their bartenders don't give enough sh**s about prompt service.  At best, it'll be slow going at the bar, even more so if you're not on a stool (standing, waiting to be seated).  Their beer selection is good, though, and their cocktails are tasty.  A bit pricey. Overall I think it's worth a visit.  Great place to just hang with friends or family before an event downtown or an after work yap fest."}
{"text":"I'm kinda torn between giving Lucille 2 or 3 stars. I want to like this place- it has a great aesthetic, I love the garage door style windows that can open up and really ventilate the place and allow you to enjoy the outside even though they don't have a patio, and the bank vault downstairs is fun. 
I've been here for drinks a few times, and the drinks are awesome. They change up their cocktail menu fairly frequently, and I haven't had a bad one yet. The tap list is usually interesting and they have a few decent wines.
I don't think I'll be coming back for food though. I ate at Lucille this summer and everything save my one cocktail was disappointing. And, I actually ordered a second cocktail, but it never came to the table, although they did try to charge me for it at the end of the meal.
We had two appetizers to start. The cheese curds were decent. The Artichoke dip app was sad; the dip itself tasted fine even though it wasn't quite hot, but the tortilla chips served with it were downright inedible. They had seemingly been cooked in cold oil, absorbing the poor quality (maybe old) oil making them soft in some places, greasy all over and tasting very stale. 
We had a Detroit style pizza that was very lack luster. I mean, it's pizza, so it was edible, but it's not something I would choose to eat again. The crust was kinda chewy, but not in a good way. The cheese was very bland, they would be better off using Wisconsin brick cheese- higher fat content and more flavor than mozzarella. Sauce was unremarkable. The toppings were fresh and good though.
Service over all was poor. I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, I don't know everything that's happening in the restaurant while I'm there, but I barely saw her unless she was walking quickly past my table without even glancing our way. 
TL;DR : Drinks are good. Style is great. Food was barely palatable. Service was awful."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place! Nice ambiance and decorations. Their basement is really cool too. 
Cocktails are great, but is pricy. Heard that their nachos and pizza are really good!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night, and were so pleased with Lucille! We showed up around 6pm (I think), and we were pretty lucky (and surprised!) that they had a table for two open as the place was packed! 

The atmosphere inside of Lucille is so neat -- it's such a cute/trendy space with lots of history behind the building itself as well. We sat upstairs, in the long row of two/four person tables where one side is a cushioned bench along the wall and the other side is chairs. I felt a bit close to the other pairs of people dining next to us, but it wasn't the worst -- maybe a little more space between tables would be nice. 

We each got our free moscow mule kegged cocktail with our Yelp check-in, which was a nice perk! All of the menu items sounded so intriguing and delicious, but we settled on splitting a medium salad along with the smaller size of their wood-fired crust pizza.

We chose the Italian Pantry Salad (field greens, carrots, baby mozzarella, piquillo pepper, artichoke hearts, Castlevetrano olives, fresh basil, white wine-basil dressing) and WOW this salad was AMAZING! I loved it. Like really, really, loved it. So stinkin' good!!!! And guess what... it got even better when our pizza arrived! We went for the Umami Pie and it was out of this world. YUM. I've never had such a sophisticated pizza before (black garlic creme fraiche, manchego, grilled chicken, roasted mushrooms, spinach, caramelized onion, fresh rosemary, scallion) and I absolutely loved it. The flavors worked so well together, and I loved the crust thickness -- not super duper thin but not that doughy and thick either, it was just right. 

We had a few pieces of pizza to take home for leftovers. I reheated them in my oven the next day and they tasted just as great as the night before. 

All in all, I would love to eat this dinner over and over again because it was SO great. I'm going to have a hard time not ordering the same thing next time I visit Lucille! Thank you Lucille for opening me to a world of sophisticated pizzas (and one of the best salads I've ever had) that I never knew existed :)"}
{"text":"Great find!  Need to check this place out and it's history.  The tacos were very good, and the wood fried pizza was fantastic.  Also we had two different kinds of salads and they two were very delicious. I asked the server for a recommendation on wine, and she suggested one that was very very good.  If I'm ever in Madison again I will surely return to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for food and drinks on Sunday evening. We sat at the bar hoping for quick service.

While the holiday drink menu was very fun, it was disappointing. I ordered the mulled wine and was seriously given about a quarter cup! It seemed almost like a joke because there was such a small amount. The people next to us asked us if we got the same amount as them and we did. For $12, what the heck?! They thought the same thing!

We were never given food menus. We noticed another couple was given plates, assuming they ordered food, but food was not served for a very long time. We actually ended up leaving before they were served. 

All in all, I have eaten here before and the food was great. The venue itself is awesome and the holiday décor was cheery. It was just really disappointing the quality and price of our drinks, and the lack of service."}
{"text":"Very good Brussels sprout pizza, but too loud and a bit over priced. I would say it's about the 4th best pizza place in Madison (for reference: one, two, and three are Salvatore's, Brutta, and porta alba respectively). However, if you're on capitol looking for a totally solid pizza before heading to the majestic, this is a perfectly good place to eat."}
{"text":"We had a party of five and ordered four items: the guacamole starter plater, the mojo pork tacos, a flatbread Mediterranean pizza, and veg-fest Detroit-style deep dish pizza. The pork tacos were pretty good, but my husband has had better. We were all happy with the variety of food available to vegetarians, since the rest of us like to eat vegetarian. The chips were probably made from flour tortillas, so they didn't have the typical corn taste. The guacamole was good, but it was bitter (maybe a lot of lime), had very large chunks of avocado (larger than we liked), and was not plentiful enough to cover all the chips. The Mediterranean pizza had a wine taste (probably from the olives) that I was not a fan of at all, but the thin crust was excellent. The veg-fest pizza had deliciously fresh vegetables, and I loved the cheddar cheese baked crisp around the edge of the crust, but the thick crust was very bready. Overall the food was good, and is worth a visit. The waiter was ok, but it was very busy on the Sunday night we went, so he was not very attentive. Reservations HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"The interior is great, for sure. It's like nowhere else in Madison. The biggest shortcoming for Lucille is the pizza. My group found the crust to be bland and a bit dry. The toppings were sparse and underwhelming. For example, the asparagus on the pizza was served cold and mushy. Maybe they're still getting their act together and the food will improve. I'm willing to try it again. But for now it's nowhere near the quality of grampas, sals, or even Ian's for that matter."}
{"text":"This place is so much larger than I thought! There is a big upstairs for dining and a cool lounge/bar in the basement. It's perfect for groups but also great for a more intimate dinner. 

Came for drinks with some friends, we each got a different drink and they were all tasty, interesting and very unique flavor combinations. Mine had tequila and lavender in it (as the picture shows). My pals also got the Mediterranean pizza which had basil, arugula, mozzarella, artichokes, feta, and olives. It was really great, and I loved the crust. After we ate a little we went downstairs and had a drink in the vault room, I loved the decorations in there. I will for sure be back to enjoy the full dining experience, I would love to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, although it can be loud for conversation if it's crowded. There just aren't many soft surfaces to absorb sound. In the summer they open the large doors, which is lovely. The food is delicious, but the bill can add up quickly with salad and wine (few glasses under $10). They also have an interesting tap list, but it would be helpful to have descriptions so you can browse. Try a daiquiri shooter, yum!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Lucille. I have only been here twice, but both times were pretty amazing. The restaurant itself is just so cool. It's a really nice space.

The fried cheese curds are amazing. They're fried to perfection. I believe we got ranch with the cheese curds. I'd probably like to try the paprika-lime aioli at some point.

For pizzas, we split three among the 7 of us. We got the Southpaw. So, the description of the Southpaw threw me off because it said BBQ sauce. Here I'm thinking it'll be like a sweet BBQ. Turns out, the pizza is very spicy. It was delicious though. The spiciness didn't kick in until after I finished the entire slice.

The other pizza we got was the Umami, which was an awesome chaser pizza to the Southpaw. It definitely made me feel a little better about the spiciness of the Southpaw. The black garlic crème fraîche is so unique and really embodied \"umami\".

The third pizza we got was a special - the Kickin' Chicken. I was too full to try it, but I was told it was good!"}
{"text":"Lucille is simply wonderful. I have been here three times and am always so happy with my experience! They have a real cool interior and fantastic pizza and drinks!

The first two visits we hung out in the lounge downstairs and just had some cocktails (fantastic Moscow Mules, by the way). I am pretty sure the lounge was converted from an old bank safe, but it is adorable and romantic!

On the most recent visit, we came to try the pizza and were not disappointed! We tried the Tomato Pie wood-fired pizza and The Weekender steel pan pizza. Both were very delicious. The Tomato Pie had a very strong and spicy sauce, so while it tasted good, I could only manage to eat one piece with all the spice. The Weekender was much more mild and I could have kept eating it all day, but the pieces were so big and thick, I actually could only eat one slice of this as well!

Luckily for me, my friends let me take the leftovers home and I have at least 3 more meals that get to be filled with the joy of The Weekender! And when that runs out, I'm going back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome interior and all around cool place. The pizza is great and their date night special is a great deal. Would definitely like to come back. Also just a good spot to grab a drink. Expect a wait though, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"They've excellent drinks, but their pizza leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of the options are unique, with ingredient combinations you wouldn't normally find on a pizza like coleslaw and fried chicken among others. And a lot of their options are like this, so it's kinda hard to get into any of their food. Wouldn't order food here again, I think. 
But the drinks are a different story - they've a variety of drinks ranging from sweet elaborate ones to simple ones that can cater to anyone's palette. 
The staff are friendly and the service is good. It's a trendy place popular with young working professionals."}
{"text":"I truthfully really like this place and think that they have excellent food, wonderfully kind servers, bouncers and staff. The gentleman who manages the bar on the other hand is one of the most unfriendly and disrespectful people I've witnessed in the service industry. 

My first experience with him was when a girlfriend and I went to Lucille on a weekend afternoon and we were two of about 6 patrons. No one at the bar greeted us, made eye contact or said hello. We ended up finally flagging the bar manager down to get a drink and an appetizer and it seemed like he was very inconvenienced by having to serve us. Every interaction was him grunting at us or rolling his eyes. At one point we actually asked another bartender who was working and was super friendly if we had done something to offend him and if maybe he could just serve us instead, the other bar tender apologized and did note that this was a complaint they receive pretty frequently. The snacks and drinks were great but that interaction left us not wanting to return. 

We ended up booking the Lucille Bar for New Years which was a really nicely done event. All of the staff were extremely kind and helpful among all of the NYE chaos and their Chef was incredible! Once again, in a few small interactions with the bar manager he was absolutely not a highlight and you could tell that most of his staff was uncomfortable around him due to his negative energy and aggressive personality. 

If he was not part of the equation this would hands down be a five star review."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, probably would have been better if we got our drinks before the food and had plates to eat on. Maybe our waiter was having an off night but there is no excuse to have to wait 45 minutes for a beer, we went to the bar to get drinks (where the bartenders were rude) our waiter was hanging out down there, we had to grab our own plates from the waiter station. He was aware of all of this and just said they were understaffed that night"}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal this evening, just the two of us. Starting of course with cocktails. I had the Devil's Hand: bourbon, chile liqueur and citrus. My husband had the Picnic Clique: a blend of mezcal and tequila and melon. Both are very summery and the bartenders know how to wield a shaker. 
For a starter we had the tostones, and you should too (see picture). Crispy fried plantains topped with a fresh pico de gallo made from locally grown ingredients and served with a house-made sauce very reminiscent of a dressing from 1000 islands.
We had the Veg-Fest steel pan pizza (also pictured), which is a near-religious experience. They make their own sauce (simple and so fresh tasting) and dough, using Spotted Cow beer. There's tons of cheese--they even WRAP THE CRUST WITH CHEESE and bake the lot into a magical, crunchy, gooey pie.
We look forward to coming back for more. We both loved the comment on the menu: \"If it can be grown here, you can assume ours is locally sourced.\" They list the many farms they partner with to obtain ingredients, including of course all that wonderful cheese I mentioned.
Our server, Dan, was friendly and knew how to take care of a table well. Looking around, I'd have to say that is exactly what's to be expected here.
There is no wonder Lucille is packed more often than not. High quality food, cocktails and service in a funky, modern space. We loved every sip and bite, and I'm quite looking forward to the contents of our to go box (very smartly sealed with a cool custom tape) tomorrow."}
{"text":"FINALLY made a visit to Lucille this past weekend and I can't wait to go back!  I'd heard mixed reviews on the pizza but honestly that's crazy!  That being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos...seriously...they are the best nachos I've ever had!  Their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a Merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a MUST for after dinner socializing (tip: order the Mexican Firing Squad)!  Way to go Lucille, yet another killer restaurant added to Madison!"}
{"text":"Went here around Christmas and the atmosphere was as festive as it gets. In terms of beer variety, this place is well above average, with a healthy compliment of imports and locals, even if I sometimes scoff at the heavy lean towards hoppy IPAs. 

Service was top notch. Our waiter, Josh, was polite and prompt and had superb command of the menu.

I've been here late night for drinks and conversation. The vibe can be a bit loud/crowded for my taste. I could see a younger version of me loving it for the more conversational basement level which takes advantage of the architecture of one of Madison's finest structures.

However, the food was the highlight. We had the Detroit-style pepperoni pizza, which is comparable to Jet's (or Pequod's for the pie connoisseur) in that it is rectangular and thicker with caramelized goodness on the outer crust. I hope to return soon to sample the thin crust and look forward to updating this review. I consider the Detroit style to be the best pizza in Madison, though I'll still be going to Grandpa's and Sal's for a change-up."}
{"text":"This was a great meal! Great service and the pan pizza was superb. We enjoyed the view from the second floor of the capital. A definite treat for our group."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Friday evening for dinner. We were told it would be about a 45 minute wait, which we were fine with. Ended up being only about 25 minutes! That was nice. 

We tried one of the seasonal pizzas, the Irie. This thing was amazing. It was SO not what I was expecting, in a really good way. Definitely try this if you get the chance. 

We also started things off with the cheese curds, they were really great. They were super filling, too. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos as well and can't say a bad thing about them. 

We ended up taking most of the pizza home. Leftovers! It was weird that our pizza was jammed into a small to-go rectangular cardboard box when I had seen others taking actual pizza boxes with their leftovers, but that wasn't a big deal. 

Service was great. The food was great. Overall, another great experience!"}
{"text":"new, trendy pizza joint, right off the Capitol. They had a nice beer and wine list.  I had a local APA from karben4 that was delicious.  Tried both a wood fired pizza, and a pan.  The wood fired was absolutely delicious: spinach, garlic, banana peppers... The pan was good, I'm just not a big fan of the thick crust style.

The wait has been long on the weekend I'm told, we had a party of two and took the last table at 6pm on Thursday night."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cool bar on a hot day. I had the fog lantern (strong drink, limit is two per person) it was pretty tasty, and I left with a good buzz. I originally asked the bartender if I could start a tab and pay with cash in the end, he said yes but when it came to pay he ran my card. (No biggie) but his attitude towards everyone seemed like he didn't want to be there, or he just hated his life. Who knows, besides the non social, grumpy bartender, everything else seemed pretty cool. They even had a downstairs lounge area, but I didn't want to check it out because he (bartender) was already frustrated that customers were going down when \"clearly there is a sign that no one can read\" (bartender)...overall good place!"}
{"text":"We were told that when in Madison we need to try Lucille's and we are so happy that we did. What a great environment full of good people, fun drinks, and out of this world pizza! We went with the sausage-fest Steel pan pizza which was enormous. Luckily we saw the table next to us order first or we would have been stuck with 2 boxes for leftovers. Perfectly crisp thick crust pizza stack with piles of cheese and sausage. All of their pizzas looked amazing but I will say you can't go wrong with the sausage-fest!"}
