{"text":"This place is great. Love the atmosphere and the name of the place. They have all types of asian cuisine - Japanese (sushi), Korean, Thai, and other mixes.   If you know what to order, then this place is great. I went here twice and was very pleased with the quality of the sushi. For a place that serves so many different types of food, the sushi was great. I wouldn't try the Korean food because Korean food in Cleveland...not the best. I also ordered the Mango Curry and was very pleased with the taste of it. It was great and filling.   I am a fan of this place. My experience with service was very pleasant. The place was packed yet they still came around to our table 4-5 times.   I would highly recommend going here with friends or on a date. Great place to go."}
{"text":"What am I missing?? Lots of friends love this place, but at best I've found it barely adequate. Tried the Korean twice and it was lackluster--if you can't get the rice crispy in the Bi Bim Bop, why bother? Tried the sushi on the third visit, and that was even worse: dried, old, one piece actually turning (speaking not rhetorically but literally: I wouldn't bring it home to my dog). With great sushi at Pacific East, brilliant sushi at Ginko, and good Korean in Chinatown, they won't find me giving them a fourth chance. One and a half stars."}
{"text":"Great service and very good curry and fried rice dishes. Also, love the scallion pancake appetizers"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times in the past three years and this was not the greatest. The scallion pancake didn't taste anything like how it should and it took quite a while to get their attention to finally get the bill. Less time on the phones please. I won't lie and say everything was terrible because that's not the case. The summer roll and crab Rangoon were really good but the scallion pancake was something I wish I didn't eat. I just know what not to order from there now. I hope someone else has a better experience."}
{"text":"I'm giving Tree Country Bistro 5 stars because they serve the BEST Basil Fried Rice with Tofu that I have ever tasted.  Having lived on Coventry when Mint Cafe opened (I became a fast devotee), I was hesitant to try Tree Country...out of loyalty, of course.  I am sooo glad I got over that!    Back to the rice.  It is perfectly spicy (read:  pretty hot), the tofu is perfectly cooked, and the green veggies give it just the right amount of crunch.  Sometimes this dish can be too sweet, rather than spicy, but Tree Country really nails the sweet:spicy ratio.  Everyone I work with swears by their Country Pad Thai, and I'm sure I'll try it, once I get past my current infatuation."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I would DEFINITELY not go back. The soup was average, but far from good. The shrimp dumplings were 100% the worst dumplings I have ever had. There was probably 1/2 of a shrimp distributed between 6-8 dumplings. They were basically dough balls. The entree, pad thai, had very little meat and was average at best. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Crunchy Pad Thai and the Alaskon Maki are my favorite things to order here. Always great service and I love that you can order to go."}
{"text":"Decent place. Got the pad thai and a mango dish, but we thought the sauces got swapped. The pad thai was insanely sweet and the mango was very savory. Would have enjoyed the dishes if the sauces were switched around. Very nice service though! People seem to dislike the waitress, but she was very nice and I found her entertaining."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Tree Country Bistro for the first time while traveling in Cleveland.   9/23/14 (Tuesday 6:30pm-7:30pm)  The restaurant had a comfortable number of patrons and was clean and well decorated. Our server was courteous and brought our drinks and food at a timely manner.   Ordered the Eel Sushi, Country Pad Thai, and Pad Thai for a friend and myself.  Sushi: this was brought to us first, served warm which is nice. The sushi was delicious and well decorated in a leaf like plate.  Country Pad Thai: my friend is generally comfortable with medium spice and found this to be a tad spicier than she would have liked. Still enjoyed it nonetheless! Pad Thai: I enjoyed my regular pad Thai, though it is slightly sweeter than the many Pad Thai I've had in the past. The shrimp was succulent, but both my friend and my chicken was a bit dry for our taste.   Total: $29 + tip  Overall, a very good experience. The portions were generous and we had leftovers to take home. The couple next to us also boxed their food. Quality and price worth your time. :)"}
{"text":"This place is good. But it's not great.   Pluses: Atmosphere, diverse menu, service.  Minuses: Unlike some of the other commenters, I do think there is a \"watered down\" feel. I prefer Pacific East's sushi and Mint Cafe's Thai...  That said, if you're in a group with varying tastes for Asian food, this is a very good compromise"}
{"text":"Had an impromptu Valentine's dinner with my friend and co-worker kimmie.:) Knowing that it's that time of the year, I called ahead and asked if they can sit us around 8pm- although it was to the very last minute, they were able to accommodate and reserve a table for us. When we got there the place were packed with couples and family alike. we were immediately seated, handed a menu and couple of glasses of iced water. Our server was very busy that it took him a while to get our orders.  We had soft shelled crab tempura for starters. the batter was done just right that it's not doughy at all and it didn't mask the taste of the crab and the vegetables with it. It was still hot and very crispy when it was served which was great.:) Our main entree was the sushi/sashimi a la carte.:) They spaced the serving of our food very efficiently as we were done with the appetizer before our sushi/sashimi plate came out. The dish looked soooo pretty that i had second thoughts on eating it!!:) It was delish!! we had octopus sushi, unagi sushi, scallop sushi, black marlin, tuna and yellow tail sashimi.:) i love the unagi the best!:) it was cooked to perfection and the ratio of rice to eel was just right that one didnt overpower the other.. also, the size was perfect that i didnt have to really stretch my jaw and mess that work of art up.:)  We had a good experience!:) the reason that i gave them 3 stars was because I had to literally wave my arms to get our server's attention for out check..:) Maybe i should've given them 3.5.. hmmm.. next time.:)"}
{"text":"Really great sushi.  Fish was fresh and delicious - spicy mayo is more spicy than many I've had.  Unagi didn't have much or any of the typical bbq sauce, which really let the taste of the eel express itself.  Scallops were amazing - tasted more like scallop than most I've ever had.  Food was ready quickly (for takeout) - will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I had not heard of this place prior to my visit but my husband and I wandered in for lunch when most of the other businesses were closed. This is one of my new favorite spots. The sashimi was fresh, portions were fair, and service was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Like Karen, I too am wary of restaurants trying to do many different ethnic cuisines, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.    The service was much better than Mint Cafe.  My husband had a kimchi and I had the pad see ewe, which I love and isn't on Mint Cafe's menu.    We also ordered a sushi roll, to determine if we would come back for that.  The roll had cooked shrimp on top and eel, avocado and cucumber in the middle.  It was pretty good for Cleveland, but I'm not completely sold yet.  I would have to go back for more sushi-oriented fare to be able to make a final decision.  Overall, a great find within walking distance and I'm happy to go back again and again."}
{"text":"I have to say me and my wife have been going to tree country since they opened and have loved the tofu mango fried rice but the last to times we have ordered take out they have added shrimp and chicken to it. That would be great but my wife is a vegetarian and will not eat it. The first time i took the blame thinking that i ordered it wrong but this time no. So i called to tell them about there mix up and all i get is an manager yelling at kitchen staff about mix up while im still on the phone."}
{"text":"Great place! I love it because they're prices are reasonable and they have both sushi and Thai!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVEEE this place (I'm betting this gives you a pretty good idea of where this review is going)!!  Right in the heart of Coventry, this tiny little restaurant is an Asian food haven!  I had heard nothing but awesome things about this place so of course I had to check it out, and it only took one bite of food to turn me into a regular.  I've had a variety of items on the menu - noodles, soups, sushi, you name it - and I can honestly say I've never had one bad meal here.  I would definitely recommend you order the tom yum soup - your taste buds will thank you, I promise!  I'm also a huge fan of the Japchae noodles, you can't go wrong with those either.  Actually, let me just state that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  This is a great little place to stop in and eat, but you'll also have a hassle-free experience if you place a to go order (well, except for the trying to find a quick parking spot issue...).  I would have to say give this place a try - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, and I'd give it 5 stars if I knew more about the menu.  Unfortunately, I'm a simple man that loves panang curry.   And the panang curry is consistently great.  So great that I do my best to go here at least once or twice a month.  The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is really nice and low-key, and there is no-where else around that can satiate my craving for thai curry dishes like Tree Country Bistro.    That said, there are a lot of other things on the menu, and Tree Country Bistro tries to please a wide audience.  I've never tried the other dishes, so I can't speak from experience, but the impression I've gotten from the many people that I've taken there is that they are satisfied but not blown away.  Still, for the relaxed feel, the great curry, and the good prices, this place is my favorite in Coventry and one of my favorites in the area.  If you like curry, do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! Appetizers: steamed gyoza, fried calimari. Main dishes: garlic shrimp, jade noodles, teriyaki chicken. All were very well-prepared and presented. Bubble tea is also very good. Good service, nice quiet atmosphere - a really nice Mothers Day dinner."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Went there on a rainy Saturday afternoon in September and got a nice table right by the windows where we could people watch. It was one of our Saturday lunches out without the kids. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by this establishment. Very nice decor, clean, good attentive service, excellent food and decent prices.   Started off with the Summer rolls (2) with House Special Sauce which is basically Hoison Sauce with crushed peanuts in it. Very fresh, very nicely presented on a square white plate, and very delicious. you could tell it was just hand rolled seconds before we got it. My wife tried the Vegetable spring roll, which were deep fried and served with sweet and sour sauce. Also very good, but I preferred the fresh summer roll in rice paper - trying to stay away from fried. My wife also tried the Tom Yum soup which she initially thought was too tomato-based in its broth, but it grew on her to the point by the time she finished it, she said she did like it quite a bit. It was a fitting choice for a wet and cold afternoon.  For the main course I had the Country Pad Thai, which was excellent, a very generous portion (especially for lunch) with about 2 ounces of chicken and 3 shrimp. Very flavorful, and had a little bit more of a kick than the regular Pad Thai. My wife had the Hamachi Sashimi which was fresh and tasty.  Definitely would recommend this restaurant and we'll be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Don't come here in a large group. The service that my friends and I received was horrible. Before we started to order we were informed that we would only be able to split the check 4 ways because it would be \"easier\" on the staff. One word for that lazy.   Next, the food came out staggered so some people were eating while the others watched. :/  Sushi - Meh. I've had better - a lot better. The first roll I tried had tempura shrimp in it, tasty but the shrimp wasn't crunchy at all, so disappointing. The second roll had a tempura sweet potato in it. The sweet potato wasn't cooked thoroughly it was actually cold in the middle. If you want great sushi go down a few doors to Pacific East and you won't be disappointed.   Entree - I ordered the mango curry and it was delish. I also tasted a friends pad thai and it was just as delicious.   Overall, if I were in the area and had a strong hankering for curry or pad thai, I'd stop in again. I don't see that happening anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a couple of times (as friends have picked it as a place to meet) and Im not sure why i even bother. The food is so unbelievably bad. Every time Ive been here, the food is clearly not fresh. The rice is stale the sauces are cold. The veggies taste as if they were froze, literally freezer food.. its a real disappointment. Given there are 2 other restaurants on this street that serve similar food that is superb, Im not quite sure how it stands. Ive tried and tried, and for certain I will not be back."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai in town.  I've had nothing but terrific service here.   I'm not huge on sushi but everyone I've been there with seems to think it's the cat's pajamas."}
{"text":"Been here now on a couple of occasions.  The service is wonderful.  Staff are friendly, attentive and food is made made quickly, but not so quickly that it seems it's already sitting in back ready to go ....  Food was good, not great, but good solid Thai food.  I'm not an expert, but I would say that this was homestyle cooking which was easy on the spiciness.   We had the jade noodles and the green curry.  The jade noodles were a very lovely shade of green.  Haven't yet tried the sushi, but it's on my list.  I am also very curious to try the Korean options.  I will definitely go here again and add an update."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have visited this restaurant since it's started the service.  I should write this review long time ago but I didn't do it because I am Thai and I am just afraid that people will think that I get any benefit from this review.  Tree country bistro always welcome me and my friends as a family.  I always take my friends and visitors to dine here because they have mix types of Asian food.  It is located in a convenient area,easy to find parking and it is so closed to CWRU.  the price is affordable and as I mention earlier, they serve Korean/Thai/Japanese food which is good for a group of friends.  What I like about this place - I like the stability of the taste of the food and the friendly service.  Every restaurant has its low-high point.  I found that they try to keep their standard.  They provide warm welcome tea.  The server is friendly and attentive.   The taste of their food is quite stable when compare to the other restaurants.  Their dish might not completely standing out but never gave me disappointment.   I like their noodle - both PadThai and crazy noodle.   their noodle is soft and tender but it is not overcooked like the other restaurant.  It is difficult to fry a noodle and get soft and tenderness in the same time.   I saw a couple of people complain about the greasy but I don't feel that way.  First of all,  Asian food is relatively more greasy when compare to Western food.  I truly think that their food is very authentic taste and I really think their Padthai is the best Padthai in this area.  Most of Padthai I got from the other restaurants are overcooked.  If you know how to cook, you will appreciate how hard it is to cook fried rice and get a beautiful shinny grain of rice.  All of my friends and visitors love their food.  we will definitely back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai Restaurant in Cleveland. Good food; nice staff, plenty of seats.   I always get their Pad Thai Country Style. it's SO good! I tried their gluten-free version and it literally tastes the same as the original!  The portions are huge so i usually only eat half and take the rest home. I usually get the spiciest level but it's still not spicy enough for me.   You should also try their mango sticky rice (after asking how the mango is). It's really good!"}
{"text":"Listen, I've been searching for better pad Thai all over this country. I moved across the country five years ago and STILL can't find a better Pad Thai anywhere. Eat this."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, at least 3 times a month for pad Thai- tried to place a pickup order at 9:30 ( they close at ten) wasn't able to order a bubble tea because the guy told me that he already cleaned the blender they use to make it- fuck that- it's rude and irritating- walk a half block and go to Tree Country Bistro- at least they want your money- forget about about High Thaid"}
{"text":"one of my favorite spots to hit up after work on the east side. good service and flavorful high quality food."}
{"text":"Really good chicken coconut soup. Sushi is OK, but nothing to write home about.  Korean food is also OK.  But most of their long list of appetizers and stir fries and Thai foods are really good. Service is fast."}
{"text":"I ordered basil fried rice and it was not having the flavor, and its so greasy/oily I couldn't eat it. Service is also not that great, she did not even asked my preference for spice levels. When I conveyed that the rice was so greasy, the response I got is \"It is supposed to be Greasy\" :("}
{"text":"Tree Country has been revived for me! Since my first review, I've had a couple more experiences and they have improved significantly because they actually stand out as far as the food goes.  I had sushi takeout once and it was delicious! Everything I wanted and expected it to be! Recently, I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and we split two dishes after some fantastic summer rolls! We had the kimchi fried rice and the crazy noodles. Both were delicious, but I was disappointed in the spice level in the crazy noodles--2 peppers on the menu made me think I was getting some heat. Unfortunately not. The beef in the dish was really good, though. The kimchi fried rice was DELICIOUS. I had never had kimchi before and really fell in love with it. I think next time, I'd get beef in it instead of chicken, but we were doing one beef, one chicken dish and the rice got the chicken this time, so I can't complain. Now I know!   The drinks weren't anything spectacular, but they also weren't super pricey, so I really have no complaints. I had a tiger lily and the pink lemonade--the pink lemonade went down faster than virgin pink lemonade =/ and the tiger lily was the opposite.  As far as service goes, I was a little frustrated. When we walked in, we were ignored for a little too long and left standing at the door awkwardly. Once we were seated, it took pretty long for our server to come back and get our drink and appetizer order. She also disappeared for awhile at the end of our dinner, which was bad because my meter was up and we needed to run. We were stuck between waiting for the check and running to feed the meter in order to wait longer for the check. We were also waiting pretty long for our dinner, but it was during a busy time, so that's a little more understandable.   Despite the service issue, the food was good and I probably will go back soon."}
{"text":"It is a very nice place in a great location. They were open at 3:30 in the afternoon on saturday, which is different from their business hours on the web and also on the door."}
{"text":"It was a five-star stay until the heck had arrived. I was with a friend who lives around the corner and I had not tried this location so I thought, fo-shizzle lets do it since he is into food and I knew that I could trust his opinion. He said that they have reasonable prices and large portions and good ethnic food. He is Chinese and a foodie so I thought fo-shizzle. They have many curry options. pho/Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese options. It was a hot day and the restaurant was not cool but it was fine and it was also rather busy. We ordered and the food came and it was large and very tasty. I got  Baquiqu or something like that. Sorry I would usually write down unfamiliar food but it was basically spicy pork in a pan of mixed veggies in a special sauce. It was very filling and the portion size was more than fair. It also came with Miso soup which was not the best nor the worst, heavy flavor but acrid to a point. Then the check came. My item was ~$12 but I got charged for ~$17 so that was not cool. They were busy enough that to have to stop the attendant and correct the matter would have been a nuisance so I just paid the fare but I don't think I will return because of this. I had a feeling it was going to happen too. The attendant to the table did not seem to like me and would stare me down. It could be my devilish good looks and charming personality but hard to say. I know this much I am taken so she needs to take two steps back or my gf will tap dance around. Overall good food, but pay attention to your check. They like to add their own gratuity per se"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This place has been one of my best friends since I began my undergrad career down the street. Now, 10 years later, after exploring everything Cleveland has to offer, I still frequent this establishment--one of the best Thai restaurants in the area.   Located in the quaint Coventry neighborhood, Tree Country offers up curry, noodle, rice dishes, and some amazing sushi in both dine-in and take-out form (both are equally as good, trust me). The wait staff is friendly and brings your food out hot and at your preferred spice level. Pro-tip: Spicy is actually spicy here. If you're feeling adventurous, give the '7-star' a try. Yes they say it only goes up to 5, but this is for the true risk-takers.  My favorite dish is the Crazy Noodle with Tofu, but I'll gladly switch it up with the Pad Thai any day. If you're a vegetarian, this is one of the best restaurants around the area! Most of the dishes can be made vegetarian and they even have a vegetarian section of the menu.   The prices are also extremely reasonable. $9-$10 gets you a mammoth portion of noodles, rice, or curry. Do yourself a favor and visit Tree Country. Beats out Pacific East down the road, although the cuisines are a tad bit different."}
{"text":"Overall, this is probably the best Asian place on Coventry. Not quite as speedy service as Hunan East, but just about as tasty and well done, and nowhere near as pricey as Pacific East, and they have some of the most artfully prepared sushi and garnishes I've ever seen.  The service is a bit iffy actually getting a seat, but once you're there, its generally fast. If it isn't the place is ambient enough to not mind waiting a spell.  Anything pan-fried here is wonderfully light, though soups are a bit hit or miss. I still remember the pork dumplings during the first visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time dinning in this establishment.  The waitress didn't seem to know much knowledge to the basic questions that I was asking which was annoying since I don't know much about Japanese food with me being Hispanic. She gave us water but didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink.  But I most say the food was really good. BUT MY DINNING experience took a turn for the worst when I was told to turn around my shoulder and there it was a freaking cock a roach. I told the owner and all he said was sorry and killed it in front of us like serious. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great service.  Ordered Pad Thai and Country Pad Thai.  The food was cooked to perfection, large portion size, so we were able to have 3 meals out of it afterwards.  Further, the spring vegetable rolls were an excellent appetizer.  Highly Recommend and we look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty good, but I went for a Korean dish.  While the dish was OK, they didn't serve panchan as the Korean custom dictates.  Very disappointing. When one holds one's self out as serving Korean food, one must go the whole 9 yards."}
{"text":"Amazingly good Asian Thai food. As a New Yorker I usually get pretty good Thai at home but this place serves really good Thai/Asian fusion. The portions are big and prices reasonable. The country pad Thai, the crazy noodles and Indonesian fried rice were all really good. Service is fast although the waitress may have angry resting face syndrome when in fact, she is quite accommodating and efficient."}
{"text":"Would probably not be my first choice for asian food on Coventry. Came here for lunch. I think this place is a great value if you're very hungry. It's pretty cheap and quantities are generous.   Service was fast and we did not have to wait very long for our food despite the place being half full. That was a little surprising for lunch time on a Monday.  The chicken bibimbap was pretty sad. It came with some very weak hot sauce stuff that did its best to pretend to be gochujang's 16 year old brother that reads at a 6th grade level. The bibimbap also came with minimal veggies and dry chicken. The ratio of the bibimbap was all out of whack too. I like rice. This thing however was about 80% rice and 20% other stuff.  The Japanese lunch special was a great deal at 11 bucks. Miso soup was a little on the salty side. The sushi rice in my maki role also didn't have enough seasoning. Easily the best thing I had here was the pad Thai in the lunch special. I also enjoyed the orange slices, but that only kinda corresponds a little bit to their ability to make good asian food.  I think this place tries to be a one stop shop for all asian foods but doesn't execute it well. It's convenient, has pretty good service, and a good value. I just wish the food was better. I want to like this place better. I'm guessing that from my experience and some other reviews too, that they probably do southeast asian cuisine the best here. If I come back that's what I'll be getting."}
{"text":"stopped in here because there was a wait at pacific east and we were just too hungry to wait. didn't try their sushi (i'm a slave to pacific east and don't think i can stray esp when it's right down the street) however, was pleasantly surprised with their thai menu! i had the mango curry chicken which was tasty and piping hot and my husband had the pad thai, he too was veeeery pleased. service was a bit on the slow side but once the food was out we had no complaints, especially when the check came. we will def be back."}
{"text":"This is the best in cleveland. The pas Thai, crazy noodles, Basel fried rice and sushi is the best anywhere. Always consistent. I've eaten here 5 times a year for years. Never a let down."}
{"text":"We had to try Tree Country Bistro, since Coventry Road is our local. The atmosphere is great, dimly lit and laidback, and the service is good. The scallion pancakes were crispy and light (though could do with a few more scallions) and the spring rolls were also good. Unfortunately, the bip bim bap was a disappointment -- not your classic  bip bim bap at all. But the miso soup it came with was very good. I'm guessing Tree Country does Thai better than it does Korean, based on Yelp reviews. We also had the Bangkok Duck, which was good, though nothing amazing. I see myself coming back just for some soup and appetizers sometime, or perhaps to try the Japanese egg noodles. This is also a good place to bring a group."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually order their Tom Kha soup and different sushi rolls. Always tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland. The Crazy Noodles are my favorite. I also really enjoy the Indonesian Fried Rice and Chicken Cashew dishes. The service is always fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Great delicious food. The service is slightly slow but it's worth the wait. I hesitated giving it a 5 stars because the aesthetics of the restaurant isn't the very best; however, I would revisit many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and the place had a nice quiet environment for a family-style dinner. Waiters were prompt and we didn't have to wait.   I got the Hawaiian Makimoto Sushi Roll. Although t was a bit pricey for a single roll, the taste wasn't bad. It definitely wasn't the best sushi I've tasted, but it was decent. I've had other dishes here like the Pad Thai and I'd much rather eat the pad Thai than the sushi."}
{"text":"For my money this is the best sushi in Coventry, if not all of the greater Cleveland area.  Variety, flair, and flavor abound at this place.  Not only that, but the prices are very reasonable.    Sushi not your thing?  No problem!  TCB's non-sushi offerings are out-of-this world.  For starters, their Tom Yum Soup is incredible.  A light, spicy broth with onion and mushroom and either chicken or shrimp for only $3.50!  I also highly recommend their Kimchi Fried Rice which I'm convinced contains ground unicorn horns, pixie dust, and a dash of #TigerBlood because it is magical.    Not a bad thing I can say about this place other than it doesn't exist within my kitchen, so I actually have to travel to go there.    Would I recommend this restaurant?  If it weren't obvious already:  YES!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  They have a variety of ethnic asian cuisines.  You just have to be careful what you order.  Obviously don't come here to order Korean food...The Pad Thai is good, chicken cutlet fried rice is great as well.  Sushi is great.  Their basil fried rice is my favorite. And its all served in a large portion for a good price.  Also, if you mention to the waiter that you have a birthday boy in you party, they'll bring your table a nice dessert."}
{"text":"I want to like the food here because I love Asian food, but try as I might, I just don't. I have ordered from a variety of cuisines: Japanese, Thai, and Korean, and I feel like in an attempt to provide everything, they don't do anything particularly well. The food is bland, the sauce is watery, the vegetables are overcooked, and nothing is particularly authentic. I think if you want Japanese food, you'd be better off going to a Japanese restaurant. If you want Thai food, you should go to a Thai restaurant. If you want Korean food, you should go to a Korean restaurant. This place is none of these."}
{"text":"This is now the third time I've eaten here. The first time was dead, the last two haven't been. The food is still great, but the service apparently sucks if there's more than 2 tables.   I can see why there's so many take out orders..."}
{"text":"Service is constantly rough...it's usually one woman who takes care of all of the tables and she always seems rather cranky and careless. However, the food is consistently delicious and the dish presentation is lovely."}
{"text":"Good for takeout and they have some decent lunch deals if you want to eat in. Not the best place in the area for sushi, though, so I'd stick to the other parts of the menu. They are, however, way faster than the place down the street, so if you don't want sushi and you don't want to wait, Tree Country is a good option."}
{"text":"We order here regularly, 1-2 times per month. The Basil Fried Rice, Indonesian Fried Rice, and Pad Thai are our favorites. Food is good and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"We had wanted to go to Pacific East but found out that they're sadly not open until 3pm on Sunday. Welp. A girl's gotta eat so we made our way down the street to this place.   Their Country Pad Thai (an apparently spicy version of the regular) gets 4 stars from me. It comes in a gigantic plate loaded with chicken and shrimp, crushed peanuts, the usual. Portions were huge - would've been enough for lunch and dinner.   Also sampled the Crazy Noodles from my partner's plate - wasn't too crazy about it but they don't skim on the spices here so you get a full taste of the Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Thai run asian bistro, with a decor and feel that trends toward Thai-American decoration motifs, with lighter not-quite-pastels along with creamy browns.  The menu includes kimchi-bokumbap, dolsot bibimbap and ranges into sushi/sashimi as well as thai cooked dishes with myriad curries and the like.  The bokumbap was decent, but the fare is decidedly pan-asian, risking the Archilochian addage, \"The fox knows many things...\"    Still, the overall quality is far from poor.  Middling price range and friendly service round this out to a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet: we went there late at night, shortly before closing (which I feel guilty about, but we were hungry.)  Service was fast and friendly.  I've been all over the world, and this was simply some of the best food I've ever had (in general, not just Asian.)  We had the pineapple fried rice, a kimono maki roll, and a Bangkok tower roll.  All I can say is that it was absolutely fantastic. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go on a date night with my husband. The staff is super friendly and the food is always fresh. My two favorites are the basil fried rice and the Indonesian Fried rice. We have also ordered take out from here a couple of times and I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for now until I try more. Now that Mint Cafe is gone, my roommate and I have been searching for our default \"Asian comfort food\" restaurant. (After large projects and conferences, we usually eat pad thai together.)  Good thing Tree Country Bistro is just across the street! We both ordered pad thai. I ordered Country Style Pad Thai and asked for it to be \"authentically spiced.\" I still thought it was fairly mild but it was pretty delicious anyway.  The service was great; the waitresses checked on us fairly regularly and kept refilling our waters.   The rest of the menu is overwhelming with the # of options, but I can't wait to try it all. I'm still hesitant to lift my Cleveland sushi boycott (holding out until I go to the coasts) but I wouldn't mind giving Tree Country a try.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to go for some quick take-outs. It's probably the cheapest Asian restaurant in Coventry! Here are some things I've tried:  Indonesian fried rice: I really love the crispy chicken on top and scarfed down the 6-7 pieces of chicken without even noticing. Then, when I got to the rice, I was surprised that it's pretty much like a separate chicken fried rice dish. Unfortunately, the crispy chicken made the fried rice quite oily. The flavor was great and all, but I felt sick-ish after eating it.   Basil fried rice: This had a great flavor, but it was also oily. I'm starting to think that perhaps they just put a lot of oil in the fried rice dishes.   Country pad thai and pad see you: These are hands down two of my favorite Thai dishes ever, and Tree Country Bistro does a great job with both!   Chicken satay (appetizer): 4 little chicken kabobs for $6-7? Tasty, but kinda overpriced.  Thai iced tea: sweet with a bit of bitterness, just the way I like it :)   Overall, I'm a fan of Tree Country Bistro. Price is [somewhat] reasonable, and service is great!"}

{"text":"The food is yummy, service is always friendly, and food comes out quickly. Big portions, so I always have extras to take home. I usually order off the Thai menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Casual.  Food: 5/5; fantastic! Location: Parking garage nearby for those busy nights. Right by the University Circle/Case area.  Pricing: Cheap! More than worth the money! Service: 5/5; Very attentive and friendly, even when busy.   Best Thai place I've been to. It' a mix of Korean/Thai/Japanese but I come here especially for their thai food - the pad thai might be the best in Cleveland. Can't stop ordering their Indonesian Fried Rice - the combo of the rice with the fried egg and fried chicken with that amazing dipping sauce! It's delicious! I know their other entrees are great as well. I don't like chicken satay but my boyfriend loves it so we tried it here and I fell in love...   Their sushi rolls are made right at the sushi bar - I love the Spider Maki! (though I'm no expert - not a big fan of raw fish).   We've have the fried bananas and ice cream (don't know what the actual dessert is) because they usually surprise us with a treat after our meals. Of course they get brownie points for that! I cannot get enough of this place.   I've never had takeout here, but I would highly recommend a dining in once before you judge their food. I've had my fair share of asian food - both Americanized and authentic - and this is definitely one of the best."}
{"text":"Oh, Tree Country Bistro, you keep changing my mind! I still LOVE you (especially your basil fried rice! YUM!), but I have had a problem recently!...  The first time I ordered your Country Style Pad Thai, I loved it. I thought it was better than my former favorite down the street, High Thai'd. Between my boyfriend and myself, this dish has been ordered a handful+ more times since that first visit. But the last few times, it hasn't had any reasonable amount of spice! So I have started asking for it \"spicier than usual\" and saying things like \"I like my food spicy, I can handle the heat!\"   ^This is what I did today when I ordered food to be picked up, hoping that it would cure my worst-summer-cold-ever. I specifically said that Tree Country Bistro's food hasn't been spicy enough for me recently, and I was sick and wanted it to have an extra kick! The person who took my order laughed and said ok, extra hot! HOWEVER, when I got home and started eating, the extra spice was nowhere to be tasted. I realize I have a cold so perhaps that dampened my tastebuds a bit, but it tasted terribly mild (still delicious, but mild!).   I may be a blonde-haired Scandinavian, but I really do like my food with a bit of kick to it. So PLEASE give me the heat I ask for!   Obviously this review is a giant complaint, but I still love the food, so 4 stars rather than my previous 5."}
{"text":"I visited tree country on a Monday night with my parents. We were seated promptly.  The restaurant is located in Coventry, an area in the city of Cleveland heights, a suburb of cleveland that has a bunch of cute shops.   The staff at tree country were pleasant if a touch slow. Our food was delivered quickly, but it took a while after being seated to order and a while for our server to swipe our cards for the check.  As for the food, I had sushi and took a few bites of everyone else's food. The sushi was delicious and appropriately priced. I felt it was appropriately light with great flavor, and I left feeling like I'd had a good meal but not as if I was weighed down. I also tried a bite of pad see ewe with tofu, which I thought was quite delicious.  I will definitely come back for more sushi, and i would recommend this restaurant for eat-in or take-out."}
{"text":"Love love their pad Thai. I like it with tofu and vegetables but the regular kind is great here, too.   Off the beaten path for sushi - they have some great sushi! Everyone tends to go for pacific east, but Tree Country is worth a try.  Service is fantastic! Everyone is nice and friendly and sincere about it.  They have Thai, Korean, and Japanese food and have never let me down!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Tree Country Bistro.  I frequent the restaurants on Coventry and have always noticed that business here is always pretty steady.  I stopped in on a Thursday evening, seated immediately.  I ordered a California Roll, it was just ok, avocado texture was off, the Sushi was accompanied by by shaved ginger and wasabi.  I was a little bit disappointed that the ginger wasn't pickled:-(  I ordered the Country Pad Thai, which was pretty good w/ generous portion.  This dish included a good amount of tender sliced chicken and 16-20 count (size) shrimp. It was slightly spicy as noted on the menu and a little bit sweet, accompanied by fresh chopped scallion stems, and ground peanuts.  I will definitely return.  Next time I'm going to try the kimchi fried rice."}
{"text":"The summer rolls (little bland) but I enjoyed them. There was too much lettuce compared to the rest of the roll, but the peanut sauce it came with was perfect.  Needed more shrimp. Don't know if I would order them again   We ordered the salmon sashimi , and the pieces were fresh and a good size. A few orders and I'd be full.. Which normally isn't the case w sashimi.   We also split the Country Pad Thai , it was more than enough for two, and awesome. Next time I would have ordered medium instead of mild, but it had a great flavor. My husband, who isn't crazy about pad Thai, really enjoyed it.  Will definitely order it again, and try their varieties of the dish.   Service was also attentive and quick without being intrusive/interruptive."}
{"text":"They took a reservation for my lonely a-- on Saturday at 7:45, but there were a few tables open and a spot at the bar. Point for Tree Country Bistro.  Service came in the form of an attractive short women who was prompt polite and semi knowledgeable.  I ordered the sushi deluxe which was about $20. The quality was okay. Not bad, some of it good. I'm not super impressed with rice, seawead, and the small and large roe counting against my 10 pieces of sushi. Other nigiri included were a little bit on the thin side, and the freshwater eel and the shrimp were a little dry. Like they had just been set out for too long. The salmon, tuna, snapper, yellowtail, and the other pieces were good, and a good sized slice of fish for the price I was paying.  There's nothing wrong with the sushi, but you may be able to do better. But it is a good enough stand by to get your fix."}
{"text":"I think the food here is really quite good.  Their menu is big though so I can only speak to the handful of items I've tried.  Their Country Pad Thai as others have mentioned is tasty and a huge portion, Pad See Ew, Pad Kee Mao are both good too.  My favorite from their Korean offerings is the Bibimbap which is also what I order now every time I go.  They used to serve it in a hot stone bowl which made the rice get nice and crispy but unfortunately they haven't done that the last few times.  I prefer the sushi down the street but definitely worth checking out when you're on Coventry and in the mood for Thai/Korean."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a sushi, stir fry, or noodle fix! Their menu is very diverse, the service is usually very good, and the prices are reasonable! There are tons of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu as well! My go to items are the Veggie Lovers Maki combo or the Baby Corn Sitr Fry. They have great soups, excellent spring rolls, and really good bubble tea! They are also very willing to accommodate special requests and replacing meat with tofu in most dishes, sushi, and even the summer rolls which are a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"We have eaten once at this restaurant and found the food to be mediocre. Tonight, we decided to give it a second chance, so we ordered delivery through delivermefood.com. While eating my pad Thai, I came across a hard, round, dark brown object...they had cooked a piece of cardboard into my food! Since I work in a restaurant, I try to give other restaurants the benefit of the doubt and I called Tree Country to let them know about the problem and asked that they make amends. The manager told me, unapologetically, that I needed to call the delivery company to get a refund. Though I pointed out that it was the restaurant's mistake and not the delivery company's, she insisted that I needed to call them. I understand if she can't refund my credit card directly from her restaurant computer, but any manager who cares about customer service would apologize (at least ONCE! she never did.) and offer to get in touch with the delivery company herself instead of making me do the work to make up for her restaurant's mistake. While she wasn't the person to cook the cardboard into my food, it was her job to make it right and she failed miserably and lost at least two customers."}
{"text":"This place is really an \"Asian\" restaurant. It serves Japanese (sushi & noodles), Korean, Thai, and even Indonesian. This place is among one of the many Asian establishments on Coventry and one that offers the most variety.   I have tried any of their sushi but I haven't heard any negative or compliments on that. I wouldn't stop here for Korean either since I know there are better places for that. However, I come here occasionally for their pad thai or the Indonesian fried rice. I find both of these dishes to be quite good. The Indonesian fried rice is my favorite here. The rice is soft and a bit moist. The rice itself is a bit salty with a hint of sweetness. The Indonesian fried rice comes with deep fried chicken pieces, all topped with an over easy egg. Some sweet & sour dipping sauce accompanies the dish/chicken. I've had a similar fried rice dish at Bangkok but this variation is better.  The place has a bit of Asian inspiration with fake bamboo décor near the windows and entrance. The walls and ceilings are quite colorful but the colors blend in quite nicely. The service here is average, sometimes you may get a server who's English isn't too good. On a few occasions, the servers would bring out the food one at a time even though you're with a larger party."}
{"text":"So my quest for great Thai food in Cleveland continues.  I would say that this place is a little better than High Thai'd.  It's sad that they don't do deliveries, but they do take-out.  The digest: Tom Yum:  Acceptably spicy, could have had more kick Crazy Noddles:  These are really the same thing as Drunken noddles and I found them to be quite tasty here. Pad Thai:  Ok.  Something was off about the Pad Thai, they tasted kinda rubbery and almost vinegary.  I don't know if it is because not enough sauce was used?    Conclusion:  This place doesn't get rave reviews, but is sufficient/acceptable for a quick Thai food fix.    This is either a pro or a con depending on how you look at it:  They serve other types of food here too: Korean and Japanese.  I haven't tried their sushi selection yet so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Fabulous place to eat. Great value for the meal - and phenomenal ambience complements the food. Pad thai is out of this world - esp.country style."}
{"text":"The sushi rice was not good and they packed 3 packets of soy sauce for three rolls of sushi. The avocado in the sushi was also hard, which I would forgive because we live in Ohio, but other places that are closer always manage to use ripe avocado in their sushi.  The red curry was unfortunate as well. The chicken was rubbery and flavorless and underseasoned, and sitting in watery, bland curry sauce. I had high hopes because it smelled good but it was not a great meal for me. Maybe it was an off night, but this was not worth my $50."}
{"text":"Indonesian fried rice, crazy noodle are my favorites. The serving size is large. The food is very tasty but generally oily. The food is worth 4 stars but the service is slow even when the place is not crowded."}
{"text":"I ordered country style Pai Thai and it's very salty. My wife ordered crazy noodle and it's her worst nightmare. That night she had diarrhea several times and vomitted all the noodle out. The service also is bad."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout from here for a chill night in. I was very underwhelmed. I ordered a coconut soup and it was pretty tasty. The sushi was another story. The salmon to rice ratio was very rice heavy, definitely not worth the price. Because it was takeout I can't speak on the service. All in all, if you are on coventry- brave the terrible service and crowd at Pacific East if you have a taste for sushi."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area! I love their sushi. The spicy tuna is particularly good. Charming and attentive staff. Good price for what you get. Sushi is buy 2 get 1 free at lunchtime! If you aren't into sushi, or looking for something different, try the Country Pad Thai. Best I've ever had hands down."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to do this to you Tree Country, you used to be a 5-star place to me. I moved away from Cleveland Heights and was looking forward to coming here after so long.  I was with a group of people and we ordered one dish per person to split between us. We got a Mango Chicken dish, Pad Thai, two Hawaiian rolls, Green Tofu Curry, and Bulgogi.  Fast forward 15 minutes later when the food arrives. At first I was surprised at how quickly the food came, but I soon realized why. The bulgogi was at most half a pound of beef. The Green Curry was ridiculously small. I would have needed at least two of either of those dishes for a meal. It's $13! What a joke. The special rolls also have gotten smaller as well.  After having a bit of each dish, here are my impressions. -Bulgogi: Not only a tiny portion, but tasted syrupy and bad. Not traditional at all and tasted too sweet. -Green Curry: This was actually really good. But the portion size was so unbelievably small. For $13, that is a joke. I've honestly gotten curry lunch specials for $5 with more food. -Hawaiin Roll: This was really good as well, but smaller than before. -Mango Chicken: Terrible. The vegetables and the chicken tasted like nothing, like they were just steamed despite there being a brown liquid in the dish. Way too watered down. Unless you had mango in the bite, it was just bad. And even then it wasn't that great. -Pad That: Really bad. It was dry and was very sweet with nothing to counteract that.  So the bill comes out to $92.XX (what a ripoff, we were still hungry) and my friend who was treating us gives the server $103. She goes up to get her change and the server looks at her and said \"Usually you tip 15% or more.\" For one, she didn't even tip yet, he just assumed that the extra was the tip. Two, even if that was the tip, that's perfectly fine. $10 for bringing out a few plates and giving us water? And three, you don't tell someone how much to tip! It was unbelievably rude. Unfortunately, I didn't quite understand what was happening until after we left because the server when I asked what he just said he said \"don't worry about it,\" but I can say one thing for sure. I'm never going back there to my previously favorite restaurant on Coventry. Maybe if the food was just \"meh\" I would have given them another chance sometime."}
{"text":"Went to Tree Country Bistro for the first time for a late Saturday night dinner.  The restaurant, located in the busy Coventry area, was pretty full with your typical University Circle mix of college/trendy/casual folk.  The full menu offers a large range, 50% Japanese (sushi), 30% Thai, and 20% Korean foods, so it makes a good one stop shop for a large group that can't decide on a specific cuisine.  The difficulty is that they offer so many good dishes, I was torn on what to order.  I'm giving 4 stars for now, but this can easily become 5 stars with additional visits.  Rather than a dedicated wait-person, service is provided by a 4 person wait team which is fine.  I very much enjoyed my meal of Seafood Mango Curry, a delicious blend of spicy/sweet flavors with shrimp, squid, mussels, scallops.  We also got a panko coated shrimp dinner (I was too full to try it), a california & sweet potato maki roll/miso soup combo, and a teriyaki chicken & shrimp dumpling combo.  I was very pleased with the food, the service, and atmosphere.  The only negative is their bubble tea/shake drinks - it was uber-sweet and the bubbles/bobba/pearls were so-so and stuck together making it impossible to sip through the large straw.  Coventry is a great area of interesting restaurants and shops, although it has changed a lot since my visits from youth.  Will definitely be coming back for more... it's worth the longer drive!  I want to try at least half-a-dozen other dishes."}
{"text":"4 Stars for one reason only: indonesian fried rice.  Ive been getting this dish for the past 4 years and it is consistently great. OKOK, so its fried rice with bits lightly breaded deep fried chicken, but hey, i sometimes get a craving for that stuff.   Other dishes such as bibimbap, pad thai, variety curry are 3-4 stars, but the indonesian fried rice is a solid 5 stars in my book.   Quick notes: Large portion sizes (i eat a lot and would feel very very uncomfortable finishing all of the indonesian fried rice at 1 sitting for lunch). 10-15 dollar range for dinner. Casual. Good and quick service (one time at lunch i was at a time crunch. I told the waiter and no problem, the food was out in 5 minutes)."}
{"text":"Love their country pad thai!!  High Thai'd is losing out on business big time--because Tree Country actually has consistent hours!  Love the staff, love the food."}
{"text":"Tree Country Bistro is the perfect place to go for good sushi and authentic Korean and Thai food. The inventive rolls are made with fresh fish and provide interesting flavor combinations. We tried a basic tuna maki and the Canadian maki and were very satisfied. The spicy mayo is especially flavorful and the presentation beautiful. This place \"hits the spot\" when you're in the mood for classic sushi, and their menu offers inventive rolls that are delicious and executed very well. Worth it."}
{"text":"The food here really wasn't all that bad - when we finally got it. I don't really understand why it took 30-45 minutes to be greeted on a non-crowded Thursday night. The table next to us left before being seen. We hung in there, were finally greeted (ahem, asked what we wanted), and received our food. The sushi was great. The pad thai was decent. I'm not the type that needs to be wined and dined, but all of the waiting will probably keep us from returning."}
{"text":"This place is like my sushi mecca in Cleveland.   I know I've said this before, but I really am new to the whole seafood-scene. I get grossed out really easily by certain fish, textures and tastes when it comes to our friends from under the sea. This is especially true when it comes to sushi and raw fish in general. Even seaweed can have a tendency to gag me when it's not prepared well.   As you can probably guess, it's not the most exciting adventure to take me to get sushi. I stick to what's safe for my taste buds and tummy. Usually that involves tuna, California rolls, anything with shrimp and usually veggie rolls. And the biggest thing, NO FISH EGGS. *Gagging*  At Tree Country, I was completely blown away by how tasty their sushi is! I got the Veggie Lovers and the California Roll and....WOW. First of all, I loved the variety they had in the vegetable options! This particular plate featured sweet potato, shitake mushrooms, tofu, and other fun options. Just because you don't eat fish doesn't mean that your dish has to be boring and tasteless. The Veggie Lovers sushi platter is a must.   The California Roll may seem simple to every other sushi eater out there, but to me...it can go terribly wrong. Tree Country made the most delectable Cali roll of my life. Perfectly blended flavors, nothing stood out more than the rest of the ingredients. The mixture of the tastes was just spot-on. And the best part? No gnawing on chewy seaweed! I can't stand that...  It doesn't end at sushi either. Tree Country has really tasty noodle and rice dishes that I've always been very pleased with. Again, they come in with a perfect blend of tastes and spices that leave you very satisfied. I'm a little picky about Pad Thai, but many friends have told me that they're Country version is delicious and addicting. (Meaning they get this dish for take-out weekly.)  My only complaint is that the service can be mighty sketch-ball. I'm not sure if it's just a cultural barrier or a communication fail, but it's just never quite on. It's usually relatively quiet and relaxing though, which is a big plus. And hey, I still give it 5-stars for the bomb-diggity sushi.  Especially in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. I can take people here who are afraid of Thai food and they can still find things they like. Their Pad Thai is only so so though."}
{"text":"It was horrible food! I called an order in for takeout. I was told 20 minutes, and was there in 15. Our Miso soup was cold, as was the rice,and calamari, which was as tender as a tire. I called the restaurant to complain, and the person I spoke to said, why not just put it in the microwave!. There were 2 tables seated, and I was told that they were too busy to have someone else speak to me. I would give them 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this wasn't the first time I've been here. And every experience has been the same.  Sure, it's great that they offer more than just sushi - they have an expansive menu of hot Thai and Korean dishes to choose from. This is why they deserve one star.  They don't deserve stars for the following reasons:  It's dirty. I'm not one to fuss, but my boyfriend took care to flip pages in the menu so that he didn't get filth all over his dainty hands. (I gave him crap about it) yet, he was justified. Cause when I used the bathroom - the toilet wasn't flushed from a previous use, the toilet didn't flush properly, a stale room deodorizer sat in the corner covering up lord only knows what stench... and the best part... it clearly looked like a woman spewed chunks of something creamy in color and consistency on and around the wall by the toilet. Grossed out yet?  Let's talk service.  Service with a smile? - Throw that idea out the window. The woman that took care of us also took care of everyone. (Why are they understaffed?) But she was Ms. Personality, let me tell you - she gave subtle grunts and filled water like a champ. That was the extent of her politeness.  When she took our change she took the change from the table beside us. She then asked if they needed change back. They replied, \"No.\" She then stood there and proceeded to flip through the bills. Could she have been anymore tacky?  I asked my boyfriend as we were walking out if we could never go there again.   He granted my request."}
{"text":"Had a taste for Pad Thai. Bangkok Thai was closed until 5. So I decided to take a chance and order from here instead of High Thai'd based of of pictures and reviews. Boy oh boy what a mistake!   We ordered Pad Thai and Beef Crazy Noodles. The food was overly greasy and the beef and chicken weren't even edible. Way over cooked and dry. The shrimp was decent. But it was odd that we had shrimp tails with no shrimp attached. Hmmmm.... awkward!  Won't be back... wish I would have taken my chances with High Thai'd instead."}
{"text":"If you want to do Thai for a birthday, you definitely need to come here. This place serves the most beautiful birthday fruit \"trees\"-- the cooks take their time to arrange a beautiful assortment of tasty healthy foods for a unique birthday treat!  Tree Country Bistro serves my favorite Pad See Ew-- MMMMMM! I get it with beef and ask them to spice it up! My mouth becomes watery, just thinking about the thick noodles and wonderful sauce. There is always fresh broccoli and carrots too.   This place gets crowded around dinner time, so try to come before 6. The portions are a good size so come hungry."}
{"text":"The breakdown: Tree Country replaced a burrito place whose food literally left one feeling as though your body, a gracefully sloping high-rise building, had just experienced a ten-ton boulder dropped upon it from a height of three miles, thundering down, down, down before embedding itself in the basement.  Thankfully, Tree Country Bistro's culinary offerings yield essentially the opposite results.    I love this place.  It's clean, subtly lighted, well-designed (I love the faux bamboo across the windows, and the color choices of the paint are soothing), and highly affordable (particularly due to the fact that the food quality could demand a much higher price).  Service is swift, polite, and warm, and their Pad Thai is delicious.  So good, in fact, that I've eaten that both times I've been there.  With their extensive fresh sushi selection and wide variety of Japanese, Korean, and Thai dishes, I'll have to branch out next time.  Definitely a welcome addition to the Coventry area, and to Cleveland on the whole!"}
{"text":"Tree Country Bistro is really, really, really good.   My table ordered a variety of dishes, all of which were delicious. I cannot stop thinking about the bonsai cucumber roll appetizer we ordered. In leiu of rice, a cucumber was stuffed with crab, tobiku, tuna, avocado and spicy mayo. It was served in a rice vinegar sauce. Highly reccomend.   The one dish I probably wouldn't order again is the scallion pancakes. There wasn't a desireable balance of dough and scallions...too doughy and greasy for my liking.   I can't wait to get back to Tree to try out more dishes from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"I'm mixed. Don't think I've ever been so torn about a place before. Got the Lychee bubble tea--so good! The gyoza appetizer--great! Two sushi rolls--very good! The entree--so, so, maybe even below average. I got the Massaman chicken curry. Love the pot, awesome idea--but the dish was just ok. Didn't seem like the flavor was right. I guess the real bummer was the Pad Thai my girlfriend got. One of my favorite's to order, and it was just off. I feel like if there's a measuring stick for Thai food, you can't go wrong w Pad Thai. Theirs just wasn't good, and something about the flavor was just \"weird.\" A dish I don't really think you can \"mess up,\" and unfortunately they do. Sorry."}
{"text":"The crazy noodles and seaweed salad are great!! Had good service and pretty great food! Couldn't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Nope nope nope.  Went here over the weekend with a party of 11 people, and like 'Fantastiq J.\", we were informed they would only split the check 4 ways so it would be \"easier\" for them. Ridiculous. Food service wasn't much better. It came out staggered, which normally isn't a huge deal, but I didn't even receive my appetizer until after everyone finished their appetizers and received their main entrée. Watching other people eat on an empty stomach is not fun. Also, they didn't even try to refill the water and just put a pitcher on our table. Was it because they were busy? Nope. For the better part of the night, all of their servers were just standing behind the counter.  As for the food, I wasn't crazy about it. I had the tempura appetizer and the house fried rice. The tempura was average. The carrot and sweet potato were undercooked. The house fried rice was disappointing. They were generous with the shrimp, which I can always appreciate, but on the whole it just wasn't anything special. Others in my party had pad thai, Indonesian fried rice, mango curry, and various sushi rolls. The general consensus was \"meh.\" The Indo fried rice was probably my favorite of all the dishes I tried, but the rice was too oily, the crispy chicken was dry and overcooked, and the egg was also overcooked. The sushi was presented nicely but it just wasn't good. For the pad thai, I've had better just about everywhere else I've tried in the Cleveland area.  They did provide a birthday presentation upon request. A plate of fried banana rolls drizzled with honey and chocolate syrup with a dollup of whip cream (with a birthday candle stuck in it). The honey was a nice touch that I haven't seen before, and it was actually really good.  I'd probably try the place again just to see how their Korean food fares, but if it's anything like their other food, you won't find me here again. It's not even worth the compromise if you have a party of people with different tastes for Asian cuisine. You're better off with a restaurant that specializes in one type of cuisine rather than this jack of all trades and master of none.  Want good Thai? Try Map of Thailand, Sweet Mango, or Charm Thai. Korean? Seoul Garden or Ha Ahn. Japanese? Pacific East on Chagrin."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  I love the tom kha, Indonesian fried rice and crazy noodles just to name a few.  They have korean, japanese, and thai food.  The service is not  the greatest but the food is worth the extra effort."}
{"text":"So this place has really started to disappoint me, the service, the quality and the atmosphere is going down.  There are sometimes we wait 20 minutes to even get our first glass of water, not a fan.  It seems that there has been a lot of turnover with servers and that most of them are a bit scattered.  The wait for the food is a bit longer than you would expect especially if this place isn't even busy.  I'm not going to lie, I was a huge fan of tree country but when you wait 30 minutes for water and then another 25 minutes for food..... you get a bit grouchy.  The prices are going up and the portions are staying the same, with maybe even less shrimp than before!!! WHAT THE HECK??  I've tried the korean hot pot- which is pretty tasty.  The only thing is that the food is sitting so long in the wait window that my egg isn't even yolky/runny like it should be, which is the best part in my eyes.  The atmosphere is relaxed just wish the servers were a bit happier or nicer to the  customers and that asking for more water wouldn't be met with a glare...."}
{"text":"Tree Country Bistro is in the space that used to hold Que Tal.  Quickly they have turned the room into an Asian, Japanese, Korean, and Thai restaurant. The room is very similar to the layout that once was Que Tal. The sushi chef is now in the space where people prepared your meal before. The tables are the same making for a casual atmosphere. No booths or romantic spaces, but still comfortable.   The menu is huge. Lots of sushi! Curries, noodles, all kinds of dishes. We're both vegetarian so we got #501 Veggie Lover Maki. For $12.95 we got like 40 rolls in 3 different varieties. They were SUPERB! Hats off to the chef (whom was kind as well) and placed the rolls into a heart formation on both our dishes with a carrot butterfly and swan happily in the middle. Presentation was a knockout! The avocado was super flavorful, the veggies crisp and mouth watering and one of the particular rolls had a completely unique flavor that was leaving us wondering who thought this greatness up?!  The dishes also came with a vegetarian soup and salad which was just as tasty. The dressing is yumness. One other cool thing was the rolled and sealed hand towel that you get upon ordering. This is common in Japan but I personally haven't seen it in the US other than on planes (mind you these are not hot.)   The service was kind and attentive. The employees were very friendly and the chef was equally eager to see that we enjoyed our food. I love this place thus far and plan to come back again very soon...my husband is already wanting more!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressive. Pad Thai did not have any veggies, tofu was over cooked."}
{"text":"I used to love Tree Country. It used to be my favorite restaurant on Coventry. But then I got food poisoning...  I never had any problems with their food before, as I usually ordered fried rice or noodle dishes. And to be honest, I loved those dishes! But then I decided to branch out one day, and I got a seafood soup. Later that evening I felt very sick, but I wasn't too quick to blame Tree Country. I told a couple friends about my experience and both of them said that they had gotten food poisoning after eating at Tree Country as well. This definitely raises questions in my head about  the cleanliness and consistency of the restaurant.   I for sure won't want to risk it again, so I will be staying away!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never been completely unhappy with my meals, but this last time was just not up to par. I ordered pad kee mow and the noodles seemed to be old, kind of hard and chewy, and slightly burnt to boot.   Generally I have god meals here, but I wonder if theyr'e starting to go downhill. It's not often that you find a restaurant that serves korean, thai, japanese all in one place that is pretty decent. I believe I've had all 3 here. If this is how they keep up I may no longer choose to dine here."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my boyfriend. I used to enjoy Tree Country back when I was an undergrad, but recently have been going to Pacific east instead. The dinner started off badly because our waitress was clearly not very friendly. She never asked us if we wanted any other drink besides water. She came back at least 5 times asking if we were ready to order when I was very clearly still looking at the menu because I couldn't decide. She would bother us every 2 minutes! I've been a server myself and I consider this to be very rude.   The food seems to have diminished in quality over the years, for example, the spicy tuna roll used to include more tuna and less rice...  At the end of our meal, the waitress drops off the check, and I kid you not, comes back three minutes later and says \"is this ready for me?\" With such an attitude. I understand we came att the end of your shift, but that does not give you the right to be a horrible waitress!!  With that level of service, I'm never going back to Tree Country ever again!"}
{"text":"Food: 4 Decor: 3 Service: 3  I came here with a group of friends for lunch since I was visiting Cleveland. Place was completely empty when we arrived around 1pm.  1. Chicken cashew nuts bento box lunch special, 10 Pretty good. It's been a while since I've had Thai food, and I definitely wouldn't have expected to get it in Cleveland of all places. The bento box came with a spring roll, side salad, miso soup, and white rice.  Overall, not bad and worth maybe 3.5 stars. Would probably come back again if I happen to be in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The staff is incredibly friendly and someone makes intricate art with the straw wrapper \"caps\" you get on your drink which wad such a cool touch. The menu is never ending. I enjoyed my dinner here, it's right across from Hunan!"}
{"text":"Coventry is a treasure trove of delicious Asian foods as well as unique one of a kind restaurants. Tree Country is no exception to this, containing a very diverse menu consisting of Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, and a small spattering of Korean food. I've been to this restaurant multiple times and I have always enjoyed their food. One of my favorite things to get is their Indonesian fried rice. While not anything like authentic nasi goreng, the Tree Country chefs put their own spin on Indonesian fried rice and it still tastes good. The kimchi fried rice is also good, though again not quite what I would expect from a Korean restaurant. Their sushi is pretty good, and there is debate among my friends what sushi is better between Tree Country and Pacific East down the street.  Admittedly, Tree Country dabbles in a wide variety of Asian cuisines, and many of them do not taste quite as \"authentic\" as I might expect. However, the quality of the food is always consistent, and it's a good place to go for a meal."}
{"text":"Have you ever been in the mood for sushi, curry, and spring rolls all at the same time?  Then Tree Country is for you!  I dare you to not find something that sounds good to you on the menu.  We lost count (mainly because the numbering system in the menu is a little off) at 900 items.  900!    I stopped by Tree Country last night with a group of 7.  Despite what other reviewers have said, we were all able to get separate checks.  Without any grumbling.  People at my table ordered Korean, Japanese, and Thai food and everyone seemed to like what they ordered.  I got a vegetarian avocado and cucumber maki roll.  The first time they brought it to me, it had some row on it (fish eggs...ick) but I was able to send it back and get a fresh, meat free roll in minutes.  For my entree I got massaman curry with tofu.  They make it with pineapple here, which it different that what I'm used to, but I still liked it.  The one thing that people in my party didn't like was the limited beer selection.  I had water so it wasn't an issue for me.  And despite how large my party was, we didn't feel neglected by our server.  And they didn't even tack on an automatic gratuity.  Score!  If you're in the mood for some Asian-ish food but can't make up your mind on what to go with, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I never knew vegan sushi existed until I ate here for a friend's birthday.  I had the asparagus maki which had asparagus (duh!), avocado, and another vegetable that escapes my mind.  It was very delicious.  My only complaint is that they only have a handful of these delicious vegetarian and vegan sushi concoctions on the menu.  If you plan on ordering some order at least 2 if you plan on eating it as a meal.  they are kinda' small and not very filling.  But what they lack in size they make up for in tastiness."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is the only thing I've had and that says something because normally I order something new on every visit to a restaurant. My new go to comfort food!"}
{"text":"Came here once for a quick dinner and ended up sharing basil fried rice with beef.   The good: It was pretty flavorful and actually on the spicier side. Portion was decently big for the price (I was hesitant to split one entree but it ended up being the perfect amount of food for me).   The bad: Fried rice was on the oilier side and the beef had a rather odd consistency.   Service was okay. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I really like this place's food.  The scallion pancakes with the green curry sauce are decadent and really tasty.  The Pad Thai is to die for, really amazing flavor (tried the country pad thai there the 2nd time I went and preferred the regular one better).  Also got the sweet potato tempura maki after someone's suggestion but didn't really like it at all.  The tempura seemed old.  I also got the spider maki which was tasty for sure but gargantuan pieces, seriously I don't know how you are supposed to eat maki pieces that are that big.  My dude got the kad paw pro or something like that and really dug it and the 2nd time around got the crispy fish and that was AMAZING!  Seriously a must try.  The sauce is incredible and the fish has this nice crispy light breading on it.  I didn't try anything on the korean menu, but I think Thai is the way to go here.  The sushi pieces are just too large (although the sweet potato tempura was a great size so maybe the regular rolls are more bite size the way I like it).  Totally try this place if you are in the coventry area."}
{"text":"Our complicated order was recited back perfectly by a friendly, helpful waitress.  I had the salmon skin roll, which I immediately inhaled, and the spicy country pad thai, and we shared the chicken satay appetizer - which had better hunks of chicken on the skewer than I've ever had before.  The pad thai was great - good enough that I had my leftovers for lunch the next day.  I wish I'd ordered some rice on the side, though, as it could have used a refuge from the (albeit excellent) flavor.  I asked for no scallions on both my sushi and my dinner plate. At first I thought they forgot on the sushi, but it turned out to be deliciously crisp cucumber.  Whew!  I'd come back any time."}
{"text":"I love Tree Country Bistro. Their food is amazing and the woman that runs this place is an angel. Their mango curry melts my face off, and the owner recently saved my wallet when I placed a takeout order incorrectly. Eat here or be square. Tree Country Bistro for life y'all."}
{"text":"I used to come here almost daily with my best friend in high school. I'm a pad Thai maniac. New to yelp, I decided to take a look to see how many stars this place got. I was MORTIFIED to see that it only had 3.5 stars. It deserves at LEAST 4. This is the best pad Thai in Cleveland. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, Cleveland doesn't have much to offer aside from this pad Thai. If I ever go back to Cleveland, this will be my first stop. Anyone who gave this place less than 4 stars shouldn't even be on yelp."}
{"text":"Came here last night wanting to try something different from our normal sushi place. Trying to see what else is out there... This place had a great menu and we always see people in it... First impression was ehh... the table was sticky, not sure what they use to clean it, but it was clean of debris, just sticky... Any way onto the food... First we had the avacado salad. Interesting, was hoping for more crab but it tasted ok, not sure i would order it again though... Next we ordered a few sushi rolls. The Bangkok tower was overcooked as the tuna was basically well done in the roll, and the rest of the rolls we had(variations of shrimp tempura) we just ok.. They have a heavy eel based menu after a 2nd glance and im not huge into eel... WIll come back to try the Thai menu as the table next to us ordered it and it look good.. Not sure we will come back for sushi though as there are better places in the area."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive at first to try this place, since usually when you have a restaurant that serves a multitude of different cuisines from different countries the food tends to be more \"watered down\"/bland.  However, Tree Country Bistro does an excellent job at creating flavorful and reasonably priced Japanese, Korean, and Thai food.    A group of us went here over the weekend and while there isn't as large of a Korean food selection, all the dishes that everyone got that were Korean looked delicious.  They have a good selection of Thai food, with 3 different types of pad thai and multiple types of curries.  I had the seafood lychee curry, which was packed with flavor.  I wouldn't ever think to put lychee in a curry dish, but the flavors matched perfectly.    All the food was beautifully presented, and some of the seafood and veggies were cut to resemble flowers.  At the end, we got a plate of fruit which had cute slices of cucumber, carrot, and radish cut and assembled to look like butterflies and flowers.    Oh, and they also have bubble tea!  Another big plus."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Asian takeout on Coventry.  Tree Country Bistro serves a variety of Japanese, Thai, and Korean food.  So if you have a friend who wants bibimbap, another friend who wants sushi, and a third friend who wants Pad Thai for dinner, this isn't a bad place to go eat at.  I order here frequently for work meetings.  Out of the menu, I like the noodle dishes the most (Pad Thai, Country Pad Thai, Crazy Noodles).   For the price (~$10), these dishes are a pretty good value.  My new favorite is the Indonesian Fried Rice.  Fried rice usually isn't the first thing I order when I go out to eat, but one day I had a craving and ordered it.  It's a fried rice with both stir fried chicken and chicken tempura, topped with a fried egg.  Pretty tasty.  When I order takeout for a large group, I always order it now.  I have never tried the sushi. The curries and Korean dishes, in my opinion, are tasty but nothing special.  Service at the restaurant is pretty good - everyone there is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good (2010-2011). After returning back in 2015 and 2016 a couple of times - I have been extremely disappointed.  One time, I ordered a Thai curry and explicitly mentioned no shrimp paste / fish sauce as I am Vegan. The curry definitely had a fishy taste to it and the server blatantly lied to my face saying there's nothing of the sort in the meal. Strike 1.  The other time, I decided to order veggie fried rice with tofu. I was served a plate of steamed white rice topped with grilled veggies and tofu. It was basically 2 sides (rice and veggies) neither of which were fried and it was left for me to mix it all. Strike 2. I decided I wasn't going to eat that; I told my server (same one as before) that there appears to be a mistake and she said this is how they make their fried rice. Strike 3. I asked for the check, paid and walked away never to return."}
{"text":"First I have to say that the staff at Tree Country Bistro is one of the friendliest and most helpful I've ever experienced.  We were greeted at the door around lunchtime by a man in killer black fringe boots (my six year old daughter just loved him) and our waitress was sweet and charming. I had a spicy seafood noodle soup that was terrific, my fiancé had Indonesian fried rice (I stole bites when he wasn't paying attention!) and my daughter had the kids sushi (awesome!!). Everything was delicious, displayed beautifully, and when we left the chef waved goodbye to us and said \"See you soon! Thank you!\" And we will be seeing her very soon indeed!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME for sushi! However, when they first opened Mike was the sushi chef but sadly I believe he went back to Boston. Food is still great, but the personal attention Mike used to deliver was way better than the service now. My wife loves the hot dishes, but I stick with the sushi!"}
{"text":"This place was really nice. I personally thought the dinner portions were large with a fair price. I ordered a Thai iced tea and the mango curry. The Thai iced tea was nice but waaaay creamier than I would have liked it. I ordered the mango curry with half tofu and half vegetable. The tofu, mango and curry was really delicious, however I thought the veggies that came with my dish we're not the best pairing. They were essentially little overcooked slivers of red bell pepper and onions in my curry.  Overall it was tasty, but I wish I had broccoli or eggplant in my curry as vegetables instead."}
{"text":"I had their Seafood Udon, and it was basically a big bowl of spicy soup with five strands of Udon, and a few pieces of seafood. They did a great job disguising my order of $15 as a bowl of soup.   My friend, though, had four servings of sushi for $30, and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai glass noodle it was horrible it was sweet did not mention that taste in the menu description. The noodles were chewy horrible for a reasonable price my first and last time eating there"}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai place in the area. It's good for dining in and pickup. The restaurant is nice and they have a good selection of Asian food. Their chicken satay is very tasty. It's definitely my favorite appetizer. The noodle dishes are always fresh and delicious. I prefer the pad see you with the thick noodles over the pad thai, but both are among the best I've tried. I just wish they delivered (other than through delivermefood.com)."}
{"text":"I once went on a date to tree country bistro because he was vegan and Thai food is kind of a good go between if you're looking for a vegetable based meal that doesn't immediately make you want to stop at rally's once he's out of sight. Their currys are super good but their bibimbop takes the cake. Their sushi is good if you're looking for something better than grocery store sushi but aren't trying to spend this and next weeks paycheck on a dragon roll. The better thing here is their service. Being a white person, I sometimes get confused about the difference between say a yellow curry and a red curry, but the staff here is always super helpful and I always feel at home. One thing I will caution, don't get the bibimbop if you're about to go watch game 6 in the NBA finals because you will not physically be able to consume enough beer to overcome the anxiety. The moral of the story here is that tree country's curry is delightful and the Golden States Curry can kick rocks. Also the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the finals, Go Cavs."}
{"text":"The waitress was very curt, although I was the only customer.  She gave me water but didn't ask if I wanted anything else to drink. I ordered pork crazy noodles; and the pork was undoubtedly spoiled when it was cooked.  You know when you bite into something and alarm bells go off and your stomach heaves?  Yeah.  I didn't eat more than some noodles and bite that pork piece.  I left the rest alone, Cause my appetite was GONE. So I told the waitress, \"Hey, I didn't eat this because I think the pork is spoiled, you may want to tell the chef\" and she was like, \"okay\", then she brought me the bill.  (?). Ok.... Yeah.  I won't be returning here!  Ever."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Tree Country, it was great. Second time, the service was spotty at best - so it's touch and go. The restaurant was only half full, but our waitress kept forgetting what we ordered, kept forgetting to bring items even after we asked her several times, etc.  Our food came out piece meal, which is not a huge deal, but some of us were done eating while others just started. One of the sushi rolls had a weird rock/shell in it. At the end, they over charged us on tax and tip - the waitress said she was just rounding because it was easier! Last time I checked tax was not 10%!"}
{"text":"I feel like you can really never go wrong with Thai food. So when I heard about this restaurant that offered Thai, sushi, and Chinese amount other things I wanted to check it out!   The vibe is really laid back and the service is also laid back but not in a good way. The service was slow and awkward. The server took my boyfriends order first and then gave me the check at the end of the meal, now I didn't write the server etiquette handbook but I feel like this is a no brainier, ladies first!   We started with some sushi, we ordered the spicy tuna, sweet potato, and Unagi roll. They were all very good and fresh but definitely on the smaller side, but we didn't mind.    I ordered the country style (spicy pad Thai) and it was just like all the other paid Thais I've had.....really good! I liked that this version had chicken and big shrimp, and the serving was huge I was able to take over half of it home!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed with this restaurant. We were about to go to Pacific east but decided to try this new restaurant. And, of course, we are Thai. So why not!          We went there first time but didn't wanna try Thai food. So we ordered japanese and korean (Which waiter recommended they were the best)          Miso soup is very clear, and no taste at all. We ordered Kalbi and Salmon  teriyaki but we feeled like they were only very salted dry beef mix with oil and grilled un-marinated salmon on top with bottled teriyaki sauce.          We ordered one Nigiri as well. They used jasmine rice instead of japanese rice. Nigiri is too sour which wasn't sure because they put too much vinegar in rice or sour soy sauce. There is no shrimp egg on california maki.        I went to Pacific east today, just few steps more. Pacific east is much much more delicious than it has ever been in every kind of food, especially when I think about food from Tree country."}
{"text":"I love their Tom Yum Noodle soup, and I crave it every now and then. The ambience is very nice in a cosy and relaxed kind of way, but the waitresses sometimes have trouble understanding/believing that I don't like any meat in my noodle soup. Still, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, and I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Had the country Pad Thai here and it was pretty solid. This was one of my first experiences with Thai cuisine. The food was pretty good and they definitely have a big selection of dishes on the menu ranging from noodles to curry and more! You can choose how spicy you want the dish.   The prices seem on par with other restaurants in the neighborhood with a main dish being around $12 or so. Take out is available as well.   Wait service was a bit inattentive and it took a while to get our drinks and to get the check at the end. To be fair, this was probably since the restaurant was not that full during the time we ate there."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Cleveland. I actively go out of my way to get it whenever I am in town. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. They offer several types of sake and asian beer selections. My favorite dish is Crazy Noodles. It's tofu with vegetables and a spicy peanut thai sauce that brings it all together. Just talking about it is making me crave this dish. At $9.95 you can easily rationalize going there frequently.  The food also comes out very quickly which is great for students on-the-go, or takeout if I'm just passing through town. The tables are set up along a large window which makes for great \"people watching\" if you're there late at night when the students are out.   This would be a great date restaurant, since it is a little trendy and shows that you're not afraid to try different kinds of food. The menu is huge so that even if you ARE afraid to try different kinds of food, you'll find something within your comfort zone of asian cuisine. There are over 900 menu items! The tables are divided into two sections which gives an extra feeling of privacy while you are getting to know eachother.  If you live close by, know that I am jealous. Try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sadly it is hard to get into this place because they don't typically open until after 5:00pm but it is well worth the wait! The food & staff are amazing, the variety of Japanese/Thai like food was endless but not too overwhelming & the prices were just right. The restaurant was cute, cozy & clean...can't say enough good things about this place ;)"}
{"text":"When in Rome, do as the Romans do--and order the curry! --- Typically, I get nervous when I hear of a place that tries to be everywhere at once (e.g., Korean/Thai/Japanese).  But since I suspect the proprietors to be Thai, I ordered Thai dishes and was overall a decent dining experience. Not outstanding, but not bad either.  A summary of our experience (party of 4, one vegetarian): -Vegetarian spring rolls: average. -Tom Yum Gai soup: Not bad. Shrimp was so so. -Kim chi soup: almost exactly the same soup base as the Tom Yum Gai soup, with a few pieces of Kimchi. -Scallion pancakes: fried a bit too long. No idea why they decided to offer green curry as a dipping sauce. -Dragon Roll (sushi): very creative. Fashioned a dragon's head out of wasabi, and even used two octopus suction cups for the eyes. Artful carving of radish roses and carrot butterflies.  The taste was on par with other sushi rolls elsewhere. -Kalbi (Korean): tasty, but the sauce was a bit too strong. -Indonesian fried rice: one highlight of our meal there. Very tasty, came with a fried egg on the side and sweet Thai chili sauce. -Green curry with tofu: tasty, but my tastebuds (and thirst center) did not lie -- it was loaded with MSG.  Again, a decent dining experience. Ambience was comfortable. Next time I'm in town, would consider it."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here last night for dinner. When we arrived at 730, it was really crowded and no one came to take our name down. We finally went to the cashier counter and waited a few minutes before the frazzled manager wrote our name down (I appreciate that he put our name before the people who cut us in line). He encouraged us to walk around outside for half an hour before our table was ready.  We came back half an hour later and got seated at a table that he cleared as we sat down. I ran all the way back to my car to put more money in the meter and came back, and there were no menus or water at the table. I got menus from the front myself and it was another ten minutes before we ordered. Ten minutes after that water arrived. The people beside us told us the servers had lost their check and they had already been there a really long time. We decided to just stick it out, since we'd already invested nearly an hour and were already really hungry.  She ordered the tom yum soup and the crazy noodles with beef, and I ordered the bulgogi. Food service was pretty slow, since it was really busy. When our food did arrive, her noodles had chicken instead of beef, so they had to remake it (since she didn't like the chicken in the soup). The bulgogi was okay--more like a stir fry than actual korean bbq. We finally left around 945, more than two hours than when we first arrived.   Overall, the food is okay but not worth an entire evening waiting. I got the impression that the staff was mostly frazzled and confused. The manager was nice and apologetic, constantly thanking us for our patience and for waiting. Apparently other people just got up and left when service was too slow; the waitress came out with their food and they were gone. She complained about it super loud--I could hear her all the way in the kitchen yelling about it.  I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"Tree Country Bistro. You're a pretty good thai place, you are.  My friend's stomach was rumbling, so off we went to grab a bite to eat. A cute restaurant in coventry, I was surprised I had never noticed it before.   I opened the menu and was surprised with all the options. And they weren't americanized options- these were all korean, japanese, thai dishes. Hmmmm...interesting, I said. What should I get??? Per suggestion of my friend, I ordered the green curry. Not as thick as I'm used to (which is good, b/c I don't like my curry too thick), it was full of chicken, carrots, peppers, peas, etc. I like. It wasn't too spicy but just the right amount.... definitely a solid dish. My friend ordered the lychee curry..and man, the mix of a lychee with curry is actually quite quite good.  I'm impressed. Good job. I like you, tree country. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2010 and I must say that my experience has  been for the most part consistent. GREAT sushi and the best spicy mayonnaise. I am not a sushi buff.. But I do know that I don't like for my sushi to have that fishy taste.. And I've yet to experience that here. All of the rolls are great with a lot of flavor. Ordered the Hawaii spicy maki every darn month for like a year in 2010. Probably only had one \"bad\" roll. I visited on a whim this year and the sushi was still pretty good. Not as flavorful.. But no where near as awful as sushi rock.   Only giving this place 4 stars because I really don't like any of their other food...  Service is always pleasant and prompt! Their Alcoholic drinks are tasty as well :P"}
{"text":"DON'T GO THERE FOR KOREAN FOOD!  I don't get why people are so in love with this place, but their korean food is just HORRIBLE, like miserably ridiculously horrible. It was literally just some random meat soaked with a ton of soy sauce that tasted NOTHING like korean food. I was so disappointed. I have a big stomach and can usually finish a lot more food than a regular girl can, but that time, oh man, that korean dish was killing my stomach.  HOWEVER, their country pad thai was pretty good! The regular pad thai was rather disappointing - yes I have been there many times after getting disappointed by it every single time.  Their sushi was ok. Nothing really caught my eyes. It's cheap. I'll say that at least, but if you are really hungry for some quality sushi, go to pacific east or high thai'd down the street."}
{"text":"An overall good experience.  The Vegetable Tom Yum soup is nicely spiced and was a light, delicious start to my meal. I had the Country Pad Thai which was also really good (could have used a little more spice in that one). A friend had the Indonesian fried rice. I didn't love it but they sure did!"}
{"text":"The curry is good. Don't order the beef though; it's low quality and not worth the calories."}
{"text":"The food here is good and reheats well. I particularly like the pineapple fried rice.  Review of specific dishes: Kalbi: the portion is not great for 16 dollars, it is too salty/marinated for two long. It also does not come in the traditional meat off the bone format, the meat is not on the bone.  Jap Chai: this dish is pretty well made, the noodles are cooked to expectations, the beef that it comes with is pretty good. Green Noodles: more reasonably priced version of the dish at lemongrass, it is not as good however. Pad see yew: I normally love this dish but the dish feels somehow too dry here. it's not amazing  Why have I gone so many times when I feel \"meh\" about the food?  well I'm lazy and there's not as much options in cleveland heights.  As of november, they have raised the prices of all their dishes by about 1-2 dollars."}
{"text":"They really changed the interior around. I barely recognized it after its last incarnation as a Mexican take out place. The food has always been good and the service is excellent. They have different cuisines represented on the menu and the options are plentiful. I do find myself going to High Thai'd a lot more often however. Probably because it is just about the best name ever."}
{"text":"The holy grail of pan Asian cuisine in Cleveland....me and my boyfriend go here AT LEAST once a month...soo good!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I asked for Thai Hood but still fairly bland Chicken and Basil. Ambience and service was nice but sadly not a fan favorite for me personally."}
{"text":"Came back for takeout this time & ordered country pad thai and pad see you. Both had generous portions, large chunks of protein, noodles that were not over cooked, the veg in the pad see you still had a nice crunch, and were generally yummy. The order took about 10 minutes for them to make. And as I mentioned last time, their spicy really isn't spicy. So I ask for & got extra hot sauce with the takeout. Everyone was very nice. There's nothing wrong with this place, I'm just very particular when it comes to giving out 5 stars. So I'll up their rating to 4, since I'll likely keep coming back here for takeout."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC sushi!! It was fresh and delicious, It has a wonderful atmosphere, and a really friendly staff.  They all greet and say good bye to you. They have a vast menu that will satisfy anyone at the table. One of the times we went the chef even came over to the table to give up a complementary roll.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"Quaint Thai restaurant on Coventry. Lots of variety of noodles, dumplings, skewers, soups, entrees and sushi. Thai decor. Tables. We liked it. Been here before."}
{"text":"Very quiet and nice place for group lunch. We visited this place twice so far. the menu listed varies options of east Asian food.   Cautious, some of the food marked with three chilies are VERY hot."}
{"text":"Tree Country has become my absolute favorite sushi restaurant in Cleveland! I get the California roll wrapped in yellow tail,  tuna,  and salmon and it is absolutely dynamite every time. 5/5"}
{"text":"Been here several times. This will be the last. Ordered take out Sushi and Panang Curry. When I arrived to pick it up, they almost let me walk out with only half the order. Once I arrived home, I realized that the sushi entree was not what was described on the menu (I even confirmed what came with this on the phone, EXPLICITLY). As well the salad they gave us was inedible, with half the lettuce being brown and spoiled. To top it off, I counted and there were less then 10 small chunks of meat in the curry which was pretty much just a container of watery sauce. I felt ripped off and won't be returning here again. Too many other good options in the hts. Go to Mekong River instead..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the scallion pancake because the green curry sauce was delicious! Had the hot stone bibimbap which was good but not the best ever. I also thought it was a little pricey, $22 for small appetizer and the bibimbap was mainly rice. I'd go again for the Thai but wasn't impressed with Korean. Also, our server was lovely!"}
{"text":"Great deal for lunch! They have a \"Japanese lunch box deal\" which comes with miso soup, salad, pad Thai noodles or fried rice, with sushi! It was so cute, miso soup was pretty good, the pad Thai was decent but did not have enough peanut flavor, and the sushi was also decent (if you are looking for sushi, their neighbor pacific east is the better place to go). Wonderful price and wonderful atmosphere but and overall decent."}
{"text":"The Verdict: I am always down to eat here! Come if your friends can't decide what asian cuisine to eat!  The Food: I love their country pad Thai! As mentioned in the other reviews, it's fantastic! And fret not, they have different spice levels if your a novice or a seasoned spice master. They've got pretty decent sushi. They also have Japanese, Malaysian/Singaporean, Thai, Chinese cuisine and everyone loves what they order.  The Extras: I've never seen it super packed and there's also a lot of tables. Street parking is sometimes hard to find at Coventry, just park at the metered parking lot next to Daves; it's pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I keep getting dragged back here because my friends like it, but I really don't see the appeal.  The food quality is inconsistent. Ok sure, your pad Thai is always going to be pad Thai, but think about it objectively - how hard is it to f up carbs fried in sauce? I ordered a curry (basically a rice in sauce) and it came out with super dry chicken nubs. My friend ordered a pad thai, which came out super spicy - not what she ordered.  They have a new waitress, an older Asian woman. She might be the owner, but she has the worst attitude I've ever seen. We asked for more water, and she returned with a pitcher and dirty looks for each of us. We asked for \"to go\" boxes, and she rudely sloughed my food into a styrofoam cup after I asked for a spoon.   I would not recommend going here. The age old \"pac east vs tree country\" debate has been going strong, but i have never experienced an order mixup or crap customer service at Pac East. Make what you want out of that, but next time, I'm going to pac east."}
