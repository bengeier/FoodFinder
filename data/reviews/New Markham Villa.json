{"text":"My family, my boyfriend, and a family friend, and I went to this restaurant for dinner tonight for Father's Day. The food is decent, not too salty or anything in particular, a typical Chinese restaurant HOWEVER I will not go back to this restaurant.   #1. Service was not good. Servers seemed to be too busy to even take our order and when we asked if certain regular dishes were offer (because they only gave us 2 special Father's Day menus which was quite limited and no regular menu with the usual dishes listed) she was less than helpful.  #2. Speaking of the menu, they ONLY HAD the special menu today as the regular menu apparently was not offer. Why? because they decided that on this special day they will jack up the prices. A regular vegetable and beef dish which sold for $8.95 was $12.99 tonight. This and many other regular dishes were priced at $12.99 and above when regularly it was at least $4-5 cheaper. Since we were there to celebrate Father's Day and a guest was with us, we decide to stay anyway.  #3. Unfortunately...not only did they jack up the price, we ordered half a chicken and we got a quarter maybe a third of one. They were clever enough to make sure a chicken thigh and wing was in the dish to make it look like it was legitimately half of a chicken but my dad who once owned a restaurant and was a Chinese chef himself could easily tell when it was less than half a chicken.   So recap: bad service, jacked up prices simply because it was a special day and they knew people wouldn't mind or even notice paying a little more than usual, and ripped off portions compared to describe/usual. Very disappointing.."}
{"text":"At least once a month we get together for dinner with my uncle and aunt.  New Markham Villa, which is located in the same plaza as the Club 300 Bowl on Old Kennedy Road has been a go-to place for such occasions since I was young.   My uncle is always discovering and introducing the Tsui family to various new Chinese eateries around town and it had been awhile since we'd come to New Markham Villa.  This time, my aunt and cousin from Hong Kong would be joining us.  The more the merrier!  We ended up ordering the following items:  Peking Duck 2 Ways- This dish always shows up at the dinner table.  What's not to love about roasted duck with a crisp skin, served with hoisin-sauce, scallion and julienned carrots - all rolled up into a convenient bite-sized crepe?  The Peking duck was artistically plated, not too oily, and had a crisp skin.  The duck itself was just the right combination of fat and meat.  However, I noticed the texture of the duck was a bit off!  *gasps*  Were we consuming a Peking duck that was prepared from a frozen duck?  I had my suspicions!  The crepe was quite good.  The duck meat was used for lettuce wraps.  You usually have to pay extra if you want it in lettuce wraps.  Otherwise, they just chop it up whole and give you some plum sauce.  I found the duck to be a bit on the dry side.  (Note - the duck meat used in the lettuce wraps is usually not from the same duck as the one you have just eaten with the crepes).  Chicken, Shrimp & Veggie Stir-Fry - This dish consisted of chicken and shrimps stir-fried with snap peas and celery.  It had a nice sheen which came from the dousing of oil that most dishes at Chinese restaurants get to make it look \"appetizing.\"  Garlic Stir-Fried Greens - Tender greens in a broth-based sauce topped with fried garlic.  Tasty indeed - where did I put that stick of gum again?  Steamed Bass - The was adorned with the usual scallions and ginger, oil and soy sauce.  The meat was \"sturdy\" like a fish steak, and there weren't many bones to pick through.  It was fresh and tasty.  Scallion-Ginger Braised Lobster - The lobster was of a substantial size.  The meat was sweet and juicy, and the lobster meat came off clean.  Yummy!  Sweet & Sour Pork - Nicely battered, good ratio of fat to meat and a good balance of sweet and sour.    The dessert for the night was Red Bean Soup.  It was quite good, not too sweet - but I like my red bean soup to be a bit more gelatinous and thicker in consistency.    New Markham Villa is consistent in their dishes, both size and taste-wise.  I would come back again for dinner."}
{"text":"Cheap dim sum.. Parents have dim sum here everyday.. 365 days, unless there's 30cm of snow.. Which is never in Toronto now. So sick of this place, not because of the food or service. It's all my parents fault. Service is fantastic and food is mediocre to good. 3.5 stars, if it was an option."}
{"text":"New Markham Villa is in a hidden street of Old Kennedy which to non Markham/Scarborough Citizens, it doesn't even exist but to those residents especially of Chinese descent it is well known because it is in the same building as Club 300(Bowling Alley).   3.5 *Star*  New Markham Villa has been one of the places I frequent once-in-awhile for Dim Sum.  This time it has been a long while but I'm happy of the outcome as I enjoyed good quantity in some of the dishes(Fish Maw Cotton Chicken, Bean Curd Wrap, Beef Tendon, etc...) while ONLY paying ----$1.69(!)---- per dish on this weekday morning.  Quality wise is standard which means value-wise this is one of the CHEAP eats spots.  Awesome!  Outside of the special priced hours and during weekends the price only goes up to $1.99 each except for XL items which are $2.80 at anytime/anyday.  The selection list is reasonable and the patrons are again your accustomed elders with newspapers.    The Congee cart is sometimes left in the corner where if you're a regular you can go pick up some Peanuts for snacking.  The Take-out styrofoam boxes and Bags are hidden away which might annoy some people that like self-serve(otherwise known as free goodies).  11 items for $22.64 plus on our bill the Tea was COMP'D.  This wasn't a Push-cart place but maybe they become one during the weekends when the crowd comes a-knocking.  The Dim Sum menu is in CHINESE, so bring me with you next time.   :P"}
{"text":"I was gonna give this place a 2 star but my parents were so disappointed in the quality and selection of food that they told me to give a 1 star review. So this will be my very first 1 star review. The reason for such poor review has to do with the overall experience. First off, on a Saturday afternoon you would expect almost all dim sum restaurants to be packed to the rim but not this place. It was only about 80% full. Secondly, the food was just terrible. Nothing came out fresh. Everything we got was obviously old and had been sitting for a while (Push cart dim sum). Thirdly, the portions were small and selection was limited. Fourth, the service was so slow that our finished plates were piling up in the corner of our table. The only thing which gave this place its 1 star is the price. With four people we only had to pay $30 after tax but I'm sure if the food was better we would have ordered more.  This one is on the never to return list"}
{"text":"We have been having dim sum at New Markham villa, most of all the price is cheap for a fresh dim sum steamed and served on order.  The size is good and it is an \"old style\" typical Cantonese dim sum. Service is OK and couldn't expect more with their price 1.80 morning and afternoon tea. Regular dim sum for all size is 2.10 and which is the cheapest in the area.  They are advertising their \"basin lobster dinner', \"giant lobster vs Alaskan king crab dinner\"; they served king crab at limited time, and it is included in their set dinner. My family always order the Alaskan king crab dinner once or twice time in a year. Crab is fresh and they didn't too much oil or MSG.  Last weekend we tried the giant lobster (6lbs) set dinner for 6, we have a Hugh lobster, they said is a meat lobster, we went to the other restaurant Barb Midland ave who has a big Brenner giant lobster 6.99 per lb. Which I think is \"water lobster\" less meat and watery.  Fishermen club house put a lot of spice or MSG but here at new Markham villa to me more better at least I dint feel thirsty after dinner. Come with dinner there is \"spicy wine clams\", that is a very good starter; all in all, the dishes are good size, only a little slow but they need to show the live king crabs and lobsters to each table before going into the kitchen. Place is clean, the basin dinner is an \"OK\" but we prefer a set dinner.  Basin dinner is a mixed dish in a \"basin\", I still prefer the lobster in ginger onion better."}
{"text":"Oh man. This place is just...  I came here for dinner with my family and some of my mom's friends tonight for Chinese New Year. Our party of 6 ordered shark fin soup, peking duck, mixed seafood, fried crab...thingy, to name a few.  Shark fin soup was meh. They use vermicelli as shark fin, which I kinda expected for a restaurant this quality.   Peking duck was actually very good! Problem was the second portion we weren't allowed to use lettuce since the chefs inside were \"too busy to find lettuce for us\", so we ended up eating the duck meat itself.   Mixed seafood was decent, except it lacked calamari (in Chinese it's called a three-mix seafood, this one was a two-mix: shrimp and scallop).   Fried crab thingy wasn't good. There were shells in the crab, when it's supposed to be cleared of them.  Service was also hit and miss. Some of the waiters/waitresses were attentive, others simply ignore you (even though we asked people of the same role). Also when we came, my mom's teacup was dirty, so we asked for a replacement. Problem was the replacement was also dirty, so they replaced it again...and again it was dirty. Apparently they never had the chance to wash any of the teacups since they were so busy...talk about short staffed.  The only reason this place didn't get 1/5 was the peking duck, and the CNY fire crackers they have, which were pretty fun to play with."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here for dim sum, but more so we come for some family gatherings. Yes, the price is good and the quality is hit and miss. The service is okay because my father-in-law is quite friendly with the staff. Parking can be a disaster but there is plenty far far in the back. If you want to have a large party or a banquet, and keep it under the budget, this is certainly a good option. However, I would not come here by choice. For an added bonus, you can go bowling upstairs after your meal."}
{"text":"I like the food here. However, I'm only giving it 3 stars because the service wasn't awesome. Since we're not regular guests at this restaurant, we found it a bit hard to get a server's attention because she's busy conversing with a regular customers for a long time. I did enjoy the food at this restaurant so I would come back. They have items here that I don't see at many other Dim Sum restaurants such as deep fried egg buns and layer cake so it's worth coming here again."}
{"text":"I have to admit I am cheap... OK value orientated! When I saw the ad in the newspaper that New Markham Villa has afternoon tea specials S/M/L for $1.69 after 1:30 pm, I am IN!  Luckily I came with my father, if not I definitely feel out of place!! The waiter couldn't stop complimenting me for being so good to come and have dim sum with my father.  I am really confused by which dim sum items consider as Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large or Specials since nothing are marked on the menu when I checked off what I want. So I ended up order two items that are XL ($2.20).    Dim Sum quality is not up to par, but at $1.69 for most of the dim sum, it is quite a good value. Most of the dishes are smaller in size to reflect the cost.. mini Sui Mai??  New Markham Villa really needs to work on their dim sum ordering form, as nothing is more annoying when you found out that you been sucked in and ordered something that is not what you think it cost!!  I don't think I will be a regular at New Markham Villa as yet...... Maybe never?"}
