My pizza was chewy. My water glass empty.  My wait for servers attention long."}
{"text":"What a sweet place to meet with friends and/or colleagues.  The menu isn't incredibly authentic (w/escargot and pate) but the food and service are sincere.  
Bravo Chef Michel Fronteddu!!"}
{"text":"Having moved from a downtown Oakville location within the last few years, Trattoria Timone has kept its popularity and enlarged its seating capacity. A very nice italian food selection with a number of seafood options included. The occasional dish is disappointing but mostly very tasty. Friendly and professional staff."}
{"text":"Used to be our go to place when we wanted a non franchise place . Last night, the food was average , the desert and appetizers were really bad . Even when we complained ,nothing was done .
The portion even became smaller than their normal ,that everyone was hungry after having appetizer ,main and desert."}
{"text":"At least it made me write a review but that is the best thing about the place. The location and ambience is decent too. 

The food - which is the only thing that really matters is below par; I didn't eat everything on the menu but considering the quality I wouldn't expect any better 

Ordered Grilled Calamari, escargot and butternut squash ravioli 

Calamari - Luke warn, well grilled and the aioli is decent. The flavoring below par - the Luke warm calamari is just not tasty 

Escargot - no bread with it. Who does that ? It was good but still I don't understand why it wasn't piping hot. Wasn't the worst I have had so there is that 

Ravioli - if you want to eat a decent butternut squash ravioli just to compare check out 'Cactus Club'. 

As for this one - I have made better in my sleep. It was sweet and not like squash sweet but rather desert sweet. It is charged at a premium and it is a sorry excuse for a ravioli. I would not be  surprised if they  bought it from a store and boiled it. It is served with nothing else but the ravioli and sweeter than cheesecake sauce. 

Restaurants should not be serving mediocre food 

The service was not bad as such, although I asked for some butter with the initial bread serving and that did not come till almost after our appetizers were done. They brought more bread out when just asked for butter - don't know how to take it on one hand they brought more bread on the other hand the bread is pretty sad and there was no butter when I was actually eating the bread. 

It is not very difficult to serve good food !! Is it?"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Awesome food and friendly atmosphere. My family and I have been long time customers and will continue to be just that!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Trattoria Timone for years now.  The first time we went they had liver as a special that my step-dad ordered.  My step-dad is on a continous quest to find the best liver and he found it here. He was blown away, and let the chef know how impressed he was.  Liver is not on special there very often but they told him to call ahead and they will specially prepare it for him next time he comes.  Now THAT is service.  
I have ordered pizza, risotto, pasta, you know it and I have loved every dish.  The service, atmosphere, and food are all excellent and I will continue to make the drive from downtown Toronto to Oakville just to go here. If you are looking for somewhere in Oakville to have lunch, or dinner, Trattoria Timone will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The appetizer calamari was awesome. The fettuccini pasta was a bit dry. We also tried the special of the day ( pesto gnocchi lobster) and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Top notch Italian fare, and very consistent considering they're crazy busy on Saturday nights.  Hosted a large party and everyone was more than pleased with their dishes.  Standout of the evening was the grilled calamari, something we'll be back for!
Service and ambiance was excellent as well. Absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a policy that you cannot stay at a table for longer than two hours.  So go to another restaurant, if you want to entertain clients or friends over a leisurely meal.  Despite having spent about $500, as we lingered over our coffee, we were asked to leave because we had overstayed our welcome.  However, there were lots of empty tables all around us.  Go figure."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Visited this restaurant for the first time for Valentine's dinner tonight. Glad my boyfriend made the reservation (8:30pm) a week in advance since this place was a full house! I was surprised they were even taking walk-ins, who appeared to be waiting quite a while. 

Upon entry, we were not greeted with a warm welcome from the hostesses - just a notch above an acknowledgment. They actually appeared to be somewhat clueless and a little disorganized, and once they figured things out (seating-wise), we didn't so much as receive smile while being escorted to our table. 

We came here on a recommendation, and we were not disappointed. Their \"Valentine's\" menu appeared to be almost identical to the one I referenced online, though there may have been a few items added. Very plentiful to say the least. 

Unfortunately it felt a bit cramped, with the waiter advising us to move the table for more aisle room, and our table neighbours were a little too close for comfort. But I guess that's to be expected on one of their busiest nights. 

Service was great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and everything ordered was brought out efficiently and as specified. Everything was tasty. Considering the nights' capacity, all this was definitely appreciated. No complaints in this department. 

Not sure if I'd willingly request to return here, though if someone I was with insisted I certainly wouldn't turn them down."}
{"text":"We stopped by here before a movie (it's right beside the movie theater). We used OpenTable to book our reservation. There were numerous choices on the special as well as regular menu that interested me, something rare for me. I chose the jumbo shrimp ravioli with scallops and lobster in a rose sauce. The ravioli was less like pockets and more like ravioli shaped pasta. The ingredients were well cooked, good sized and plentiful. The Rose sauce was delicous. The whole thing was covered in a tasty cheese crust that was lightly baked. The whole thing worked well was priced reasonably and was an excellent choice. My GF chose the margarita pizza which was fine, but nothing outstanding. But then you don't expect a whole lot from a margarita pizza. The wine list by the glass was ok, but pricey and could use a few better quality wines. I had the pinot which was alright but not great for $21 for a 9 oz. Not bad enough to send back, not good enough to say yumm. Service was excellent and attentive."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Southwest Mississauga during the week possibly visiting one of the many businesses in this area, Trattoria Timone is a great restaurant in an unlikely location - in the AMC movie theatre complex.  Back in the day this was one of the Wolfgang Puck locations so the actual restaurant is a good size.  Even though it is a larger restaurant, it seems like a much smaller, family run restaurant. This is a huge compliment speaking to the awesome service provided by the staff.  I have been here many times and tried quite a few items on the menu, including the raw oysters that have a regular spot on the menu (though the varieties change). Today I had melon wrapped with prosciutto as a starter, followed by the linguini pescatore.  As usual, each dish was very good.  There was definitely no shortage of seafood in the pasta and it was very fresh!  The restaurant also has a very good wine list if that is an option, and from past experience, the cocktails are served firm which is refreshing for a spot in the burbs!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times over the last couple of years, we have always found the food to be good, except one time when it was excellent. The service can be a bit sluggish at weekends and near Christmas when there seems to be lots of parties, (not really a surprise). But all in all a reasonable place for a good meal, not cheap, but if you want cheap go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could give them a 0, I would.

What a disappointment!  Was so excited as the reviews seemed to be great!  

 The waiter was so unfriendly and didn't offer any help in selecting food for me as I'm a vegetarian.  

He took forever to come and take our order.

Food was bland too.  We paid over $60 per pweson.  We were a party of 6!!! 

Will never return!  Horrible service!  Horrible foods!  Alice fazoolus would be much better and you won't be paying $60 per person for such service!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for lunch with my family. The restaurant was quite busy on a Friday afternoon. It seemed the restaurant just did a nice renovation last year. We tried eacagot, a pizza, the gnocchi, the fettuccini and the risotto. I loved the risotto con funghi. It was very flavourful and perfectly cooked. Not too impressed by the gnocchi as they were too soft, not chewy enough. Also I loved their coffee. Even an decaf cappuccino tasted delicious. I ordered an coconut cream pie. Mmmmm... maybe try something else next time. I general it was a nice experience. I'll come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"thoroughly enjoyed my experience here last week! i love the atmosphere of the restaurant and service is good too. the food is to die for, i am confident anything on the menu would be amazing. this is a higher end restaurant, so a nice place to go to get dressed up or for special occasions. the patio is also gorgeous"}
{"text":"I would give this 6 stars if possible. This restaurant is up there. From wine to appetizers to everything else, it is a phenomenal dining experience. Leave some room for dessert, you won't be disappointed. Service matches the extremely high quality of food. Need reservations for the weekend and Friday nights."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the blue cheese pear salad.  Pasta was fine.  Service was good.  Very modern, comfortable atmosphere...sparkling ceilings would be a hit for all ages."}
{"text":"The Family that own and run this great restaurant (on a daily basis) have done an amazing job. It seats a awful lot of people but still retains it's intimacy. The waiters are real pro's and very accomodating. You can chop and change the menu to suit. The food is very good (the mussels are off the chart!). They have a singer/guitarist but the volume level is thoughtful, subtle, and not irritating as with most other restaurants with music. It's reasonably priced and when leaving you will think you got value for your money. Recommended."}
{"text":"I feel like the people who gave this place more than the 3 stars it deserves don't get out very much 

Lets start with the positive stuff. Our hostess was super welcoming and our waiter was great too. The decor felt homey and bar was nicely lit... 2 stars 

In terms of the over priced food I can only review what we tried. Maybe I missed one of their greatest hits but quite frankly, I doubt it. 

Ravioli tasted store bought, then cooked in butter and old sage. 

Calamari was cold and chewy, like overcooked rubber chewy. 

Carpaccio was so bland not even the capers woke that beef up.

And if you want pizza just save yourself and walk next door to Boston Pizza because the Margherita was worse than NoName brand frozen pizza. Like day old Delissio is better than the pizza I had here. Isn't this place Italian? What a tragedy. 

And the final star goes to, the crab cakes... surprisingly big chunks of sweet crab, lightly seasoned to accommodate the aioli. That's 1/5 - so maybe it was a one hit wonder? who knows, but what I do know for sure, is that I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice atmosphere, great service. If it werent for the price point Id be a regular. Ive gone here during dinner, but would really like to come back for lunch. I always say Im going to Demeteres across from them after dinner, but end up enjoying their deserts just fine."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and fancy atmosphere. The food was not as great. Raspberry margarita was excellent. Paella risotto was so so. It has good portion of sea food which was great but it was a so so dish. Escargot had too much cheese that I could hardly taste any escargot underneath it. Tiramisu was very average. Maybe my expectations were a bit high but again if you charge that much for food it better be good. :)
Service was average. It was a busy Father's day but hey we are paying a lot and don't want to wait for a desert menu for 10 minutes and then ask another waiter to get it for us."}
{"text":"My SO brought me here to celebrate my birthday on a Saturday night.  We actually had a small wedding dinner reception at the original location on Lakeshore a long time ago.  Back then the food and service was excellent.

The food is still excellent and absolutely without fault.  The service, perhaps because it was a busy night, was not only slow but indifferent at best.  It took over 10 min to get someone to pour us some tap water.  Then he came back later to take a drink order.   Then it took another 10 min to get him to take our food order.

He was very friendly with the table next to us whether it was because they were regulars or not I don't know.  For the ambiance, prices, and overall experience I expect a better calibre of service period.  It was off putting enough that I would rather dine elsewhere than come back and risk being treated this way again... I would rather not pay or tip for perfunctory treatment...."}
{"text":"Food is pricey but delicious.  I am a pasta lover and this place lives up to my expectations. If it wasn't for the prices it would be a 5 star. Pasta dishes are $21-$29. I tried the vegetarian pizza,  seafood ravioli and Fettucine and they were all delicious. Would return again and order the Fettucini which was my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here once and I have nothing but good things to say, our waiter was extremely friendly. The food was amazing - i ordered the veal rack & calamari appetizer.
A+ for environment, staff & food."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place was amazing. The only thing better than the service is the food. The know how to treat you well. Worth every penny. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lost in Oakville/Mississauga, and wanting to take my sister out for a nice dinner we chanced a upon this gem of a restaurant.

Not knowing what to get, or what the portions was like, we thought we'd take a stab at it.  

My husband ordered the grilled calamari ($10) to start, my sister the smoked salmon and mango salad ($12) and I had the Caesar salad ($8). 
The calamari was seasoned and grilled to perfection! Not the least bit over cooked, not overly seasoned. It was just perfect. 
The smoked salmon and mango was refreshing. It featured a raspberry vinaigrette that added just the right amount of freshness. 
The generous helping of caesar salad was fresh and tangy with plenty of fresh parmigiana. 
Main courses continued to impress. We ordered the seafood risotto ($25), fettuccine ($20), and the lobster ravioli ($24). Although both the risotto and fettuccine featured white wine cream sauces, they each had their own distinct favors and tastes. The dishes were portioned just right, not too much not too little. 
Little to no room left in our very satisfied tummies, we glanced their dessert menu.
We just had to try something!  
We ordered the chocolate mousse cake ($8) and the pecan bread pudding ($9) to share. 
The mousse cake was rich, creamy and decadent. If you like hazelnut and chocolate you'll love this cake. It's like a big Roche slab! 
The bread pudding was the big surprise! The maple pecan dream was actually not as sweet as you would have thought. It was just ooey gooey goodness. 

Last but absolutely not least, what is a meal these days without service? Our service tonight was absolutely stellar! Wonderful, smiling, and accommodating from start to finish. (really you'd have to be a saint to put up with the demands of not one but TWO pregnant women!)

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This would have gotten a 5 star rating from me if it weren't spoiled at the end. Was meeting a table of acquaintances. Some, like me, ordered a drink and an appetiser as I had already been out to dinner....others ordered several drinks and appetisers plus meal. The food and drink was excellent. Everyone finished their plates so I assume they all enjoyed it. A couple of people had to leave and some of us wanted to stay. I was prepared to ordered dessert....until the waiter brought equally split bills without asking. It was very awkward and uncomfortable, especially as it was not among friends. I ended up paying far far more than my portion and so they lost additional sales as after that, I wasn't going to order dessert too and others backed out also. 

Anyhow, I emailed the restaurant about the situation and received a reply and apology. They offered a $20 voucher towards a future meal. While unexpected, it was appreciated. However, that voucher was never sent. It's been more than a month. So disappointed now twice and a customer lost. I would definitely have gone back to the restaurant with my spouse and obviously we would have spent far more than that $20. Too bad."}
{"text":"Decent food. Pretentious setting and service. A hit in Oakville as it is among the best in town, but if it was in Toronto it would be lost among the crowd of much better restaurants. Restaurant is very pricey and the food doesn't justify the prices as although decent isn't special in any way."}
{"text":"Whenever I think of Italian for dining out, nothing else comes to mind but Trattoria Timone.  Everything there is delicious.  I've had about all their salads and all of them are super tasty.  Appetizers are also great, along with their pasta.  You can ask them to make the pasta spicy and they will do so by using fresh peppers rather than sprinkling it with dried chilli peppers.  I love their seafood on angel hair pasta.  The only bad thing here is that it is too expensive to visit on a normal casual evening or lunch."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience 11 months ago we invited 5 friends. Started with drinks that were watered down. Lychee Martini tastes like powdered juice. Ordered halibut for 38.00 it was  dry and hard . Not sure who the chef was but it was an absolute shame . That piece of fish should have melted in your mouth. I advised the waitress and they charged me half price. Even then that was a shame. Somethings happened from last visit but will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a nice Italian restaurant with updated modern decor. Perfect spot to bring a date if you want to impress or celebrate something like birthdays. 

The service is good and the food even better.  I had previously ordered the angel hair pasta, lamb (very good) and the best bruschetta.  They serve warm buns with whipped butter. 

Some friends love the lobster bisque and the crab cake. If you don't like cheese and if you order the muscles - tell them ahead of time you don't want the cheese. 

They have a nice selection of wines and beer as well. 

The portion sizes are decent. The prices are on the mid range."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at Trattoria Timone and I find the service attentive and knowledgeable. One time I went there and advised them I was catching a movie and they accommodated me.  I love their pasta and seafood, especially the lobster ravioli. The atmosphere is really classy and comfortable. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent place for dinner.  Consistent quality, nice ambiance, great variety on the menu.  Get the pecan pie - it's the best you'll ever have."}
{"text":"My first visit during Christmas (with work) was so good, I knew at that moment exactly where to take my boyfriend for his birthday. this past weekend. They have the nicest semi-retro stylish decor and seating arrangement which warms you up right away.

What we ordered:
- Beef Carpaccio - nice large plate paired perfectly with parmesan, capers, arugula
- Penne Salsiccia - reminded me of something that I make at home
- Gnocchi w/ veal ragu - the most amazing, pillowy, light and fluffy gnocchi I have ever had paired with melt in your mouth veal chunks. I didn't understand what ppl described as pillows of gnocchi until I had these. Each bit I took was heavenly! OMG!
- Cheesecake - basic new york style with strawberry sauce
- Butter pecan tart - nice and big personal tart (enough for 2 ppl) that was warm and not overly sweet paired with a nice big scoop of vanilla gelato

I think I am still dreaming abouy the gnocchi and butter pecan tart in my sleep..."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Wonderful, welcoming service. My fav special occasion date night place. We had crab cakes with jicama salad, oysters, prosciutto pizza, rack of lamb, osso bucco an a to die for tiramisu. EVERYTHING was done perfectly."}
{"text":"Imagine a crazy Valentine's evening.  A packed restaurant, a hectic kitchen, a special menu ... but it was a flawless evening.  The atmosphere was perfect.  Not dark, but a vibrant 'near Italian' feel.  The food was off the hook.  Beef carpaccio was beyond amazing, the best my girlfriend and I ever tasted. My seafood risotto was perfect.  The depth of flavor more than surprised me.  My girlfriend ordered pappardelle pescatore ... omg amazing too.  This place is a gem. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of revisiting this resto last night and felt It warranted a review - charming as it might seem I realize it's truly a spot that's a function of convenience from where it's located with the ambiance and noise buzz akin to that of a university cafeteria- though it's not without its heralds (personally I do enjoy the comfortable seating in the bar area) I do realize I was there during primetime 

I always enjoy an open concept kitchen - but sadly there is no artistry taking place here  - it's a factory assembly line where drones perform  and you can watch what a pre-franchise product run by aspiring post secondary students would look like seeking a ISO-9000 certification.

They boast a standard curated wine menu by the glass and bottle - standard fare here - though no sommelier available for consult 

The Carpaccio is one of my favs on the menu and truly is one of the better ones I've had in the city - simple and true where less is more and is a great classic piece. 

The Crab cakes were actually the high point ; having had crabby patties  across the continent - for what they've presented is quite an enjoyable feat - though I did have them split it into two individual cakes as opposed to the single huge patty as it was more manageable that way as a tapas piece - and I owe kudos to them recognizing that input and making the request of the kitchen - the additional chunked avocado and mayo complimented it very nicely - it's not Maryland but they'll pass :)

The cheese board was \"meh\"'such that It offered no real value beyond the delightful jams I truly could take it or leave it but I'd rather revisit the charcuterie board I'd had on previous visits...

The smoked Salmon salad was actually drier than Preferred but the addition of figs and pine nuts to the soft cheese to the greens was a notable difference that added a sweetness I found delightful

I was actually disappointed with the Lobster pasta ravioli - as a seasonal item I found the rose sauce uninspiring and without merit  and the stuffing was bland, light and had me searching for traces of crustaceans -  all I could taste was fresh pasta cooked to perfection  - I'd personally seek this dish elsewhere 

Though I will say they make a wicked Americano coffee - and it is fantastic and when paired with a shot of baileys was worthy of a repeat (and - it's served with a generic almond biscotti )

Notably a very nice light tiramisu and flavourful coconut cream pie that both were bang-on terrific as a post meal delight - I'd suggest exploring the dessert menu :)"}
{"text":"Surprise Surprise, Don't walk by....walk in!

Located in the Winston Churchill Cineplex Theatre complex, I have often walked by Trattoria Timone and thought \"how do they make any money?.... it always looks empty\". However that may be because I am attending 10pm screenings. The fact is I have walked by many times and had the perception that this place would not be good. The design and lighting just made it seem out of place in a theater complex. I was wrong!

I went to Timone for the first time, for lunch. The restaurant opens at 11:00am which is great for anyone wanting to get an early start for lunch. And in a nutshell, the food, service and ambiance are wonderful.

The interior is Tuscan style with large stone tiles, ornate iron gratings, a large marble bar and warm tones of wood and Terra cotta. There are numerous seating options and the tables are the perfect size and sturdy!

For a light lunch we had the Roasted Pepper and Butternut Squash soup and it was generous in both quantity and flavor. The crab cake appetizer was also delicious with a warm moist center and a crispy outer shell.

Our waiter was very professional, humble and ever present. This approach seems to be a lost art in many large and self-perceived upscale restaurants....well at least the \":humble\" part.

I can't wait to go back and sample other items on the menu. I think what makes this place so great is that they make you feel comfortable and appreciated whether you order a soup and an appetizer or a full on 3 course meal. It seems to be a very comfortable environment and I believe that they can move quickly (when required due to movie times) or at a more relaxed pace when you are not in such a hurry.

Well done!"}
{"text":"delicious food here! For me to say that is alot bc I have had a hard time finding italian fare in the GTA that is to my liking...

Make a reservation as they are usually busy. Good ambience - not too romantic though as it is quite loud. Good for groups as there are usually one or two here when I dine. 

Order the sticky toffee pudding. you wont be disappointed:)

Parking is a bit difficult, depending on what time/day you come here bc there are so many other places in this plaza (cineplex/demetre, etc) 

I took off the star bc at some points it was too noisy to hear my dinner partner across the small table we were sitting at..."}
{"text":"Pre paid a deposit, assured cake, flowers and balloon arrangements were set up for ourguests arrival. 

Had us waiting for 45 mins. As well cake we brought with a cross was thrown out.  \" Although your customer won't love you for bad service - Your competitors will. Please remember news of bad customer service reaches 3  times as many ears. As the phrase for good service."}
{"text":"This was a rather rushed business meal for me so it's going to be a rather rushed review. 

Food was only warm, the service was ok & the ambiance was casual. I'd give it another go but at another time."}
{"text":"I've been there on a Friday night with five other girlfriends of mine. We all ordered different things, and tried a bit from each other's plates. First of all our service was very good even on a busy night. Our server was very attentive and informative. The food wasn't anything great. I ordered buffalo mozzarella caprese salad. The cheese tasted pretty good but for some reason the tomatoes were not ripe and tasteless. They also did not look fresh, which is quite odd since they are the predominant ingredient in this simple salad. My main course was Penne arabiata with sausage. The sausage was not good at all, it basically tasted like a very cheap hot dog. The pasta was okay but the tomato sauce was way too greasy. I felt heavy and bloated for like a few hours right after the meal, just like I've had some heavy greasy fast food. It was clearly not made of good quality ingredients, which isn't acceptable for a fancy and expensive restaurant. On the other hand the room looked really nice and cozy. The welcome and the service was great. The staff was friendly. The service was quick."}
{"text":"A fantastic lunch treat!  I had the house salad to start and then the Arctic Char.  Beautifully done and delicious to the last bite.  I will be coming back soon.
Got to go here!"}
{"text":"I am fully aware that my particular review is probably not reflective of most people's experience at Trattoria Timone, but I will personally never return.
I was pleasantly surprised to see this place pretty busy at lunch time. 
I was seated right away. I was dining alone and they seated me at a 4 person table for some reason though there were plenty of smaller tables available. No big deal though.
I ordered the shrimps Pernod and the came out very quickly, which was a pleasant surprise. Then it turned sour. My shrimps were still cold in the middle! I never make a fuss at restaurants but honestly... I politely brought it to my waiters attention and he tried to tell me they were supposed to be that way! But before I even had a chance to say anything he changed his mind and said he would flash it in the oven for a minute. He took my plate and I was sitting near the kitchen and saw him give it to the staff back there to heat up and they said they would make a fresh one (which I think was the appropriate thing to do from the start). After several minutes my new plate came out and it was nice though my appetite had been affected by my first plate. The sauce was flavorful and well seasoned. It came with three shrimps.
After all that when the waiter  returned to get my plate he actually told me not to waste the tails of the shrimp! Nothing against shrimp tails but I found that a bit pushy/forward. I am sure he meant well but I honesty found him a bit intrusive throughout my meal. 
Then I had my main which was the lamb shank. HUGE portion. I had planned to have dessert but I couldn't even finish my main! The entree was fine, and came with lots of veggies as well as mashed potatoes, but the meat was under seasoned to my taste, though the sauce was lovely.
Also, maybe just me, but the old school Celine dion and Cher on the radio did not suit the tone of the restaurant at all."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Trattoria Timone.  Such a nice day so I sat on the patio

Sara, my server started me off with some rolls.  I only had one and it was yummy.

I love love love pizza and ordered a Salsiccia E Funghi pizza without the mushrooms.  It was good.  I liked the crust and the pizza was cheesy.  I was expecting the sausage to have a bit more kick.  I ended up taking half of it home as leftovers.

Sara was pleasant and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day. Surprisingly found a spot very quick for three people. Started off with the grilled Calamari, and crab cake. I enjoyed it. Then we had the butternut squash ravioli and Margarita pizza. The ravioli was okay. It would have been much better if it was more creamy. The pizza was awful. There was basically no cheese and it just tasted like cardboard. Overall the place is okay. If you want good Italian food I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"It took a few years to make hazy the disappointment of our first visit and return to TT. 
The interior may have changed but the cuisine remains just a pretend cousin to first class Italian.
There were no highlights other than the quality of wait-service which is still, strangely to me, very very professional. 
A note of thanks to the hostess who chose to deposit it us at the worst table in the house. It sat at the intersection of the kitchen, waiter station and the alleyway to the washrooms."}
{"text":"I don't get this place.  Food is absolutely crap at any price, let alone the prices they are charging.  I had a tomato caprese salad, where the tomatoes had no taste, the cheese was hard coming straight from the fridge, the balsamic was barely there, and the olives had a weird aftertaste.  My wife had a rack of lamb and she left half it uneaten as it wasn't cooked as well as she had specified. 

I come into this place every 5 years or so because of the convenience factor of it being right next to the cinema.  It always looks inviting from outside.  But food is atrocious; save your money, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 10. Appetizers are amazing quality! Carpaccio and grilled calamari are boom!!!! Service was decent for a group of 10, could've been better but the food is quality so it's worth coming here. Very spacious place and the art on the walls are beautiful."}
{"text":"Best Italian food!  From the moment we walked in to  the end, the service was impeccable.   I made reservations last minute and they only had a table for 11 at 5pm.  We were running late from touring Hamilton waterfalls with my relatives who were visiting us.   I was going to cancel the reservations but when I called, they were very accommodating and said it was fine to move it to 5:30pm but we would have to leave by 6:50pm restaurant because there was a party of 50 people coming at 7pm.  As we were driving over, we review the menu online and decided our order.  We were pretty efficient, arriving around 5:40pm and getting our order in by around 5:50pm.

We just ordered the main course since I knew we would have less than a hour to eat.  I'm sure the kitchen also worked fast to get our food prepared quickly.  Despite the rush, the food was all displayed perfectly and we all praised the food being delicious.  I got the Cioppino (lobster & other seafood in herbed tomato broth) which had really fresh seafood and broth was delicious.  My husband got Osso Buco (braised veal) and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Everyone really enjoyed their dishes.  

Love the atmosphere, food and service.  They definitely get a perfect score. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, the owners on the floor with staff overseeing the service! You will get your money's  worth!!! The best grilled calamari I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty enough but it seemed to rely more on the fats, salts, and sugars then it should - I could barely taste the actual food I was eating.  I kinda' expect that at a cheaper restaurant, but for a place this expensive I expect them to use high quality ingredients and to really let me taste those ingredients.

Also, their chocolate hazelnut mouse wasn't a mouse - it was more like a truffle cake.  Once again, heavy on the fats and sugars, like on the finesse."}
