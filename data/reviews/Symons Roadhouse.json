{"text":"Used to come this restaurant a lot years ago. Come again after all these time and still love all these western decor. We have a Tuesday buffet, however there is only limited item to choose and rib is not in a choice. So if you prefer a la cart menu, please do not come on Tuesday as buffet is the only options."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch. Smoked brisket poutine was outstanding. Really enjoyed this spot. Service was great as well. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to the tuesday buffet and they did not serve what was advertised and there was very little selection. There was no vegetables at all and no ribs. Such a waste of money - would never go back"}
{"text":"Brisket poutine to die for hand cut fries always the best. Nice selection of Alberta beers great authentic decor. Helpful friendly staff."}
{"text":"I first noticed this place because of an article that had a photo of this gorgeous Lobster Poutine. My friend and I were hypnotized, and knew we had to go find this spot. After an ardous journey into the wild wild northwest suburbs of Calgary, we finally found this place (in the middle of nowhere) and guzzled a glass of water the moment we sat down.   The lobster poutine was disappointing to say the least. I had pretty high standards, considering how much it was and how delicious the photo looked. I think if they tripled the amount of fries, and added another half portion of sauce and lobster, it might have been more impressive. Having been so disappointed, we had to try something else. We opted for the BBQ Pork Shoulder. It was nice, with the most delicious perogies I've ever had. My friend ended it off with a nice toffee pudding thing with warm caramel. The dishes got better as the night went on, but overall not as nice as I thought it was going to be."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I headed here to try something new. I was kinda excited to try it as the previous venue here (which was a pub) was closed every single time I tried to go there (seriously that went on for 2 years before it finally closed forever).  We decided to get the lobster poutine for the table (considering we'd heard rave reviews about it) and I got a steak sandwich with fries. Yes, I doubled up on fries - don't judge me lol  The poutine was really good! Chunks of sweet lobster and butter sauce coated the crispy fries. And you can't go wrong with a steak sandwich when it's cooked to your liking.  There wasn't anything that really stood out for me here, whether it was the food, service or ambiance. I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken dishes. The Crispy Chicken is fantastic, with two pieces of pan fried chicken that is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, this is a popular dish. It comes with Mmmm mashed potatoes and carrots.  We had the Memphis dry rub chicken wings to start, and they are a must to try!"}
{"text":"The decor is really nice.  It seemed as though they were attempting to create a high end restaurant.   The food was decent but way over priced."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch served until 3pm on a patio in the sunshine. Any takers?  I came here on a late Sunday morning and parked myself (kind of literally when you're on crutches) at one of the wooden tables with an umbrella on the patio. When I arrived there were a few groups ranging from 2 - 6 people but the place never got any more packed than that which was pretty great for my slightly sleepy and hungover self.  Their weekend brunch menu is until 3pm, and I tried the Croque Madame Flatbread (with an egg on top, $15) and an appetiser of corn fritters (four, served with honey butter and jalapeño jelly, $8). And maybe a Caesar to wash it down. I really liked all of the food, and the flatbread in particular was a nice brunch option that I slightly reluctantly shared.  They serve a good range of local craft beers on tap (Wild Rose, Village, Tool Shed), and it's just a short walk (and stairs) from the market - or maybe worth the drive if you're Lso on crutches. Definitely worth a stop in during or after your wander through the farmers market."}
{"text":"We come here on a regular basis. The crispy chicken is really good and has become a regular for me.   It's very casual, and would work well for families."}
{"text":"Alright, but not worth the inflated prices. $25 to $32 entrees are way too much.  Good BBQ beef and pork and effecient friendly service."}
{"text":"The dessert was amazing! Too bad it was made for someone who picks at their food. Too small for my liking but the lemon terraine with the heavenly little puffs of meringue was delicious. I think if I were eating at a roadhouse that it would be a heart serving like blackfoot's. I had a split pea soup as an appetizer and it was tasty although too heavy on the salt for me. The fried chicken was a perfect choice for a roadhouse menu but was a bit salty although the Crisp on the chicken delightful. The decor was super cool including a chandelier from the Calgary inn from way back. I wish it had a change table in the washroom though."}
{"text":"I'll start right off the bat by saying that I love the food.  My wife and I went there twice.   Their whiskey sours are fantastic, although a little pricey at $10 a pop, but wow are they yummy.   I had one of the best burgers ever off the brunch menu, and they have fantastic corn fritters as well.   I only wish the service was as good as the food.   If it were, we would be regulars, but as it is, we would need to be enticed of we were to ever come back.   I ordered extra bacon both times.   They erred as many times.   The first time, they just threw it on my burger, but I'd wanted it on the side.   They gave me extra bacon on the side to make up for it.   No big deal, but still, it was a sign of things to come.   When we went the next time, I got a classic breakfast and asked for extra bacon again.   I didn't get it, but my wife, a vegetarian got bacon on her plate.   This comes with what she ordered, banana bread French Toast.  However, there was no indication of that on the menu, and the chef put the bacon under the French Toast so that she couldn't just give it to me.   They took it back to the kitchen, but all they did was take the bacon off and replated it.   She would have just given it to me if that was good enough.   No comp was offered for what we believed for our whole meal was a simple mistake.  It turned out to be an egregious malfeasance , as my wife was mislead into purchasing bacon, as was I.  Had we known or came with bacon, either she wouldn't have ordered it, or she could have asked for it on the side and given it to me, saving me the $3 for extra bacon.   Perhaps this restaurant doesn't cater to vegetarians, and that's their right, but to deceive a vegetarian into ordering something with meat is unconscionable."}
{"text":"Tonight we stopped in for drinks and maybe some appies. The hostess was super sweet but sadly, our server was awkward.  Still maybe some kinks to work out with new employees. WED is wing night! YAY us! They are dry ribs, Memphis style and SMOKED, wow are they smoked! Your fingers will smell like smoke even after washing twice after eating!  They took a little while to come out but when they did, they were HOT (temperature-wise) fresh and meaty delicious! It comes with an aioli dip that I did not even think was needed! There are 7 wings to an order which I was told was a pound. Reg $14, half off at $7 tonight. Worth $7, not sure about $14 but that is just me maybe. We then ordered the BBQ chicken flat bread at $15 which comes out round as a small pizza. Super thin. Nice looking cheese on top and not too much that the beautiful caramelized onions did not make its presence known! In a good way! The way the smoky aroma wafts up as you about to take your first bite - unforgettable! I really loved the BBQ sauce on it too and I should have asked if it was house made. Recommended, the chicken tasted just like the wing meat - not a bad thing. They were out of a couple of white wines I wanted which was a bit of a downer so to hell with it, I decided to just drink Prosecco over the 2 courses! We will come back here. I would love for my next experience to be a 4 star!"}
{"text":"I tried the beef brisket poutine for lunch and it was delicious! The fries are really good. The decor has been returned to rustic Ranch rather than the bar atmosphere that was in place the last time we visited. The food is much improved as well.  I liked that the portions were reasonable and not the American sizes we've come to expect from chain restaurants.  The prices are what you would expect from restaurants using fresh ingredients and more locally obtained. I will return."}
{"text":"Food was just ok but service the worst we have had in years! Soup was Luke warm and we waited an hour and a half for our meal. Then to add insult they added an 18% gratuity because our party was of 9 people."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  We hadn't been to the roadhouse in a while and we had a huge craving for the corn fritters which used to be outstanding!  Well they were far from good. The corn fritters were super dark (either overlooked or old oil I guess) and they were really greasy. They used to be so soft and moist and delicious :(  to top it off, while the menu still says they serve it with jalapeño jelly, they don't. We got what can only be described as kraft raspberry jam.   Well the drinks were still great, so we hoped it was just an off day and waited for our meals. My wife had the pulled pork and I had the burger. Neither was great. The pulled pork tasted of fake smoke, and the burger patty had the consistence of the \"stampede\" burgers you get from the freezer at the grocery store.   We used to love this place, but I'm sad to say they have let quality slip badly and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I always prefer to try lunch at a new place before a more expensive dinner so lunch it was. This place was used years ago for private functions and remains pretty much the same inside - in a word, rustic. The lunch menu is slightly different than the one shown on their website but the pulled pork sandwich was still there so I gave it a try. It was quite good , served with fresh cut fries. My only complaint was that the bun it was served on could have been heated first so that the whole sandwich would have been if not hot at least warm.  I suspect we'll try the dinner menu at some point but I probably won't bother going back for lunch any time soon.."}
{"text":"It is closed now so no sense in beating a dead horse, we just found the place had mediocre food and high prices."}
{"text":"It has been almost 5 years since my last review on Yelp. Honestly, life and business have gotten in the way and writing reviews has been less of a priority. That being said, I feel like I need to write a wrong (see what I did there?)! And so, I have come out of retirement!  My wife and I celebrated our 4th anniversary today. I wanted to go somewhere a bit closer to home, and we had discovered that there was a restaurant in the same building as our local farmer's market, so it seemed like a natural choice. It wasn't until after making the reservation that we saw reviews that were less than spectacular, including reviews on Yelp. We almost canceled, but decided to take our chances. Boy, are we are glad we did.   The ambience was actually much nicer than I expected. Beautiful wood tables and great accents adorn a wonderful and comfortable room. Our server, Chris, was fantastic from the start. But at the end of the day, I like to eat food and drink beer (preferably draught beer). The beer on tap was a great selection of local craft from Big Rock and Village. I ordered a dark IPA and it was excellent.   We noticed that the menu differed slightly from the website and was specific for the day. For our appetizer, we ordered lamb meatballs and BBQ chicken flat bread. Both were absolutely fantastic. I am especially partial to ordering lamb, so it could be said that I know my lamb. And these meatballs were excellent.   For our entree we both ordered the bison burger. Hands down the best bison burger I've ever had and easily near the top of best burgers of any kind.   It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway, we will be coming back to Symons Roadhouse again, and again, and again.   If I can make one suggestion to the restaurant, just to nitpick, it would be to have more non-pork options. Other than that, I highly recommend making this your next meal. And now, back to retirement!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with 4 adults. We had 4 appetizers & 2 entrées:  Lobster poutine - it could have used more sauce but overall was a good dish.  Lots if lobster pieces. Mussels & fries - this was my favorite dish of the night. It was cooked perfectly with a large amount of fries.  Brisket poutine - this was good with large pieces of brisket.   Corn fritters - cooked very well.  Very crispy and large pieces.   For entrées we had: Jambalaya - I'm not sure the rice was fully cooked but the Cajun taste was fantastic.  Lots of seafood & sausages.  BBQ chicken flat bread - it was a large pizza and had lots of BBQ sauce which was good bit quite over powering.    Overall the food was great! We were so full as the portions are large. The corking fee is $15 which is very reasonable.   Service - our waitress was so great. She was very helpful, friendly and personable.  We brought a bottle of wine and she brought over an ice bucket to keep the wine cold."}
{"text":"I frequent the market at Symons valley and after visiting the roadhouse for a few drinks on Halloween we decided to give it a try for dinner. Upon arrival the hostess seemed a little confused as to the seating chart and took us to a booth then re-routed us to a tall table.  Not a big deal must be new staff in training as I saw her asking a fellow colleague about the seating chart later. We didn't have to wait long and our drink order was taken. Love the atmosphere in this place, nice and casual and rustic, prices are too high for the portion sizes and type of establishment though.  A $14 salad should be arriving in a large bowl not a small side plate.   When time to order I did ask our server what he recommended and he said the crispy chicken, which I ordered and my husband ordered the steelhead trout.  So here is my reason for only two stars... When we got our food I was very happy with my chicken, looked great, good portion size and very nice flavor.  However my husbands trout was on the verge of too raw in the middle and swimming in liquid.  When we questioned our waiter on why there was so much liquid in his bowl he said it was meant to be that way, it was a vinaigrette.  My husband told him that it did not taste like a vinaigrette, that is was flavorless, almost like it was diluted with the water from cooking the spinach.  The waiters reply was that is how it's supposed to be and that fish are meant to swim, also that he's not a professional chef so what does he know.  We told him we didn't want a free meal or anything we just wanted to know why there was so much liquid and that it didn't seem proper.  He just stood there awkwardly staring at us...really made us uncomfortable.   I didn't want to make a big deal about it but I didn't agree with his answer so when we paid our bill we again discussed the liquid in the trout dish and he again just stood there and told us that everyone has different tastes.   We just paid and left....I wanted to end the uncomfortable feeling.    I'm disappointed as I felt that he should have handled our concern better and he didn't.  No apology no offer for another plate with less liquid...as a paying customer I don't care if that's \"how it's supposed to look\"  maybe that 's so but it should not taste like flavorless spinach water.  For a place to be charging what they do for appetizers and mains if a customer is not happy more should be done to ensure you leave customers happy when they walk out the door. I honestly don't see myself going back for dinner or recommending the Roadhouse to my friends...not for the price and lack of customer service."}
{"text":"For over year and a half, I would recommend this joint endlessly and invite people to enjoy it with me at every opportunity.  Towards the end of 2016, quality started to go downhill with cheap improvisations and cold food. In September, I booked in my company for Christmas dinner because they offer great extras like a fire pit and a beautiful room and the food is generally quite good.  Mistake - I should have trusted my gut about how things had been going downhill.  Was surprised at his lack of professionalism.  I inquired about the temperature and cleanliness of their bathrooms to which he replied with \"heaven forbid your co-workers get an undercooked steak and can't appreciate where they are\".  Ummm??? Nothing to do with my concerns and.....these are your customers!   Food was 45 minutes late at the event and while it was tasty, was nothing over and above what you'd find on a regular Tuesday night for only $1 less. I've gone from being an advocate of this restaurant to never recommending again."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more from  this place, given the award winning chef and the fact the pricing would dictate a really good experience.    Don't get me wrong the dinner tasted fine but was not at all great.   the environment is quite rustic.... not befitting an almost fine dining experience.  The bathroom needed some work. The floors in the entire place were filthy...  though it must be hard to keep clean given they are rustic wood, and their parking lot is unpaved.   Menus in higher end places tend to be short. This menu is simply TOO short I think...  with only a handful of dishes which really seem like entrees.   Overall, the place was OK - but not worth the premium."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the rustic feel. Food was superb, lobster poutine, brisket poutine were both wonderful. Fun spot for something different!"}
{"text":"Beer brisket with the mac & cheese and broccoflower sides are amazing . Friendly staff with fast service ."}
{"text":"I'm truly sad to say this will be the last time my wife and I eat at Symons Roadhouse.   When this place opened we were so excited: the chef from Brava Bistro, it's close to us, great food without the yuppiness of 17th Ave., etc.   At first there were some growing pains (which were cute, and expected). After a while, you could tell the location was hurting this place; often times my wife and I would be one of maybe two parties in the restaurant. We felt bad, as the food was great and the staff were trying hard. But after a while, the food wasn't so great (Tuesday buffet is unfortunately really terrible and reeks of laziness) and the staff kept turning over (can't blame them. No business = no tips).   Tonight, my wife and I brought my parents as a holiday treat, and to our surprise the lot was busy, which made us so happy.   Wednesday is wing night, and that used to be a good thing. The wings were big and tasted great. I'm not sure if it's due to lack of business but they have replaced the bigger wings with smaller ones which make much less of an impact. Even at the half off price of $7, you give me 5 small, soggy wings?  We also ordered the lobster poutine. That has never disappointed, but my wife and I often wondered why they never provided bread or a bun of some kind with it to sop up that lovely sauce? If you don't ask for it, it goes to waste.   The mains were alright. I had the crispy chicken, which was good but the mashed potatoes tasted like the ones you used to get in the Swanson TV dinners.   My wife had the short rib that was supposed to come with yummy broccolini (and used to), but was instead given frozen broccoli freshly steamed. $32 for a main that includes frozen broccoli? Come on.  My mom had the pork shoulder, which was dry as hell. My dad had the jambalaya and did not finish it. He doesn't say much, but he didn't need to.   And, they didn't have two of the four beers we ordered. As we left, I heard the chef say to a staff member that they were running out of food. Now, for a place that routinely never is busy, how do you run out? I wonder if the amount of people tonight was as much of a surprise to them as it was to my wife and I.   Originally, my parents wanted to pay for the meal as a way to thank us for hosting them this week, but there was no way I was going let them pay $200+ (Tip included), so I picked up the tab.   My wife and I are done feeling sorry for this place and eating there to help them out. We truly hope they make a go of it there, but wonder if tonight's debacle wasn't a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.   I was told by the chef Kevin that we were there during a crazy time, as they were just finishing up their brunch - we didn't even notice.  The patio is really nice, and the whole place is rustic and smells awesome (think delicious smokey).    I ordered the pulled pork quesadilla - the pork was delicious, smokey and tasty sauce.  I wish there was MORE in the quesadilla though, as the ratio of meat to tortilla was kind of off and I ended up taking off one of the tortillas and eating it almost like a flat bread.    The service was fine, and the atmosphere was chill, I enjoyed their beer selection as well (local Calgary brews: Wild Rose, Toolshed, and Village)."}
