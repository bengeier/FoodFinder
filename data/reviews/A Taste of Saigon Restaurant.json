{"text":"horrible service.... i had to wait 30 minutes just to get bean sprouts and than another 15 minutes for the soup to finally arrive. Price does not make sense for the portions they give you... the soup taste like soap...... worst vietnamese restaurant i have gone and definitely not coming back. Please do not go unless you want to waste your money"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant, its walking distance from my home and I wanted so bad to like it.  I decided to try a sub, I ordered the spicy beef sate sub.  The service was really slow.  It was around noon and there was only one table occupied and myself and another woman waiting for takeout.  it took about 20 min to get my sub.  That was ok, if it was going to be worth the wait.  I got my sub and took it home.  The bun was decent, the meat was kind of questionable, like it had been sitting out too long or left over from a while ago.  On the menu it said it came with cheese, but there was no cheese to be seen or tasted.  Also, this was supposed to be spicy but was quite bland.  I was quite disappointed.  It lacked flavor and was nowhere as good as I have had from other places. I also noticed for the vermicelli bowls, you have to pay $2 to have spring rolls added.  This takes the price of the bowl over $11.  Remember when Vietnamese food used to be cheap? I will stick to my usual place a little further away, its worth the drive."}
{"text":"Discovered this was the tiny little hole in the the wall with half a dozen tables that used to be at the top of Silver Springs.  It's now a sleek modern spacious restaurant that has obviously retained some clientele.  It was bustling last Friday evening.  I always guage a Vietnamese restaurant by their spring rolls and sate beef soup.  The spring rolls were ok - nice filling, but I prefer the lighter crispier wraps I've had at others.  I think they may have used a wonton dough and it just didn't work - a little bit tough and chewy.    I decided to forego the Sate Beef and went for the #41 Spicy Tamarind Coco-Lime Shrimp noodle soup.  Wow - loved it!  Zingy, delicious lime flavour (lots of fresh kaffir lime leaves in the base).  I think I hauled out 10 large shrimp too!  That and their lime refresher drink were a perfect pairing.  My teen daughter went for her favourite, the WonTon soup.  She proclaimed the Wontons delicious (a combination of pork & shrimp) but the broth a bit on the thin watery side.  Had to agree with her on that one.  Her fresh Kiwi slushie was to die for - amazing flavour, incredibly refreshing and, I'd love to know how to make it because it would be an awesome summer cooler with Vodka!     Was it the best in town - nope, but is it on the list for return.  Definitely!"}
{"text":"Ordered Vietnamese coffee, a spring roll appetizer and a bowl of pho. Coffee came out immediately and was definitely not made with Vietnam coffee (which is really strongly flavoured) this tasted more like Tim Hortons watered down stuff. Appetizer took 35 minutes! The place was dead - I almost walked out I was waiting so long. Then my pho came about 10 minutes after the appetizer and was just so so. Not really enough beef for beef pho. There's a better place across the parking lot from here."}
{"text":"Love this place! They make my favourite salad rolls! We've never had a bad meal from Saigon, though we always do take out because eating in takes forever. They are closed one day per week and they shut down for a few weeks in the summer."}
{"text":"Taste of Saigon is amazing- delicious food, superb service;  a quaint little spot in NW Calgary. #36 coconut curry chicken pho makes it worth the trip!  Enjoy, you'll be back!!"}
{"text":"It took them 10 minutes to seat us and then another 30 plus minutes to get two bowls of noodle. The environment was very quiet and you can hear other customers grumbling about the wait.  They could use a little music to cover it up. I also noticed another customer waited 30 minutes for takeout.   The food was bland. The soup tasted like instant noodles. It didn't have much in there. Needless to say, we won't go back. Oh, it also took another 10 minutes to pay the bill.  If you like waiting, this is your restaurant."}
{"text":"Good flavour, but it's extremely slow. It took over 1 hour for all the dishes to come. At the end, we couldn't wait any longer, we had to take everything to go."}
{"text":"I always forget this place is here, so when I was craving Vietnamese food on my way home from work, I decided to stop by for pick up.  This place shares a parking lot with London Drugs, and is surrounded by the parking lot for Walmart and surrounding businesses so there's a roundabout route to get to it (can be a bit frustrating to figure out the first time you go here)  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and given a menu when I mentioned I would be doing take out. After scanning all the tasty descriptions, I ordered two satay beef on vermicelli noodles with extra spring rolls. I was informed it would be about 20 mins, and I was welcome to sit and wait. I took this opportunity to quickly run to the Walmart, and when I came back my food was packaged and ready.  When I got home, I didn't realize what huge portions they were going to be! And surprisingly the presentation was still intact (it didn't look like a thrown together mess like take out usually does). The beef was flavored nicely (not too spicy), veggies were fresh and the noodles were perfect. There was plenty of fish sauce, and enough leftovers for me to take to lunch the next day.  Taste of Saigon will definitely be one of my contenders if I ever have another craving for Vietnamese!"}
{"text":"Food was great but wait times make it a less desirable option compared to other restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Charged for a meal I didn't eat because it was so bad!!!!  We just were here for lunch and were served the worst vermicelli meal we've ever had. The meat was terrible quality (flat, springy, tasted awful). I could not eat the food it was so bad (as in, I ate NONE of my meal). The customer service was terrible. The waiter did not ask if our food was okay. I said I didn't like my meal. He never asked why, never apologized, and still CHARGED for the meal!!  I would never recommend this place. I am super upset they charged me for a meal I couldn't even eat because of how awful it was."}
{"text":"Your typical Vietnamese restaurant - reasonably priced and busy! I have only had lunch at this location and it's always been good and after ordering, food comes quick. I can't speak how dinner service is or if it's busy, but do know I have had lunch and take out and it's always been good, sometimes even great. Service has been hit or miss depending on your server, but I find if you know what you want and don't ask too many questions, you are fine. Will be back for more Pho!!!"}
{"text":"A Taste of Saigon recently opened up in my neck of the woods and today I thought I'd give it a try. The inside is kinda cool but a bit bland. The walls have nothing on them. They really need some pictures or wall art of some kind. They had a couple of large tv screens. The decor is modern but grey with black tables. There's a really bad tile job on the front of the counter where you pay for your food.   So I ordered a couple of shrimp salad rolls and the lemongrass chicken on vermicelli noodles. The staff I saw was quite young and a bit disorganized. Finally after waiting and a bit of confusion on their part, my food was ready for take out.   The salad rolls were rather bland and the shrimp tasted too fishy. Not sure if it wasn't fresh or what the case was. The sauce to dip the rolls in could have been more peanuty for my taste. The rolls were a good size but who cares if they don't taste good and I ended up throwing mine in the garbage.  The lemongrass chicken was a good portion and somewhat tasty but I've had way better at so many other places. There was an ok bit of lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumbers and a couple of slivers of carrots but again, other places make this way better. Can't say I'll be going back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Lovely place to have up in the NW. Went to try for the first time today.  Do not think you will be in and out of here in 20 min if you decide to eat here. The food is made fresh daily and the soup stocks do not brew incessantly overnight. I would rather wait for my food and have it good than the other way around. The Jasmine tea was hot and concentrated - not watered down and lukewarm like so many other places. The ice water comes in a nice glass container you can pour yourself, so no waiting for water refills. The restaurant itself is nice, bright, modern without any airs to it. Comfortable. Service good. We ordered the chicken noodle pho and the shrimp noodle pho, both very good. The broths were fresh and my tummy is very happy. I am full after eating here but a comfortable healthy full. Nothing beats Pho on a cold winter's day. Next time I am going to try the shrimp curry pho (YUM!) and also you can ask for #42 I believe which is not on the menu but this one is made with coconut milk.  Free fortune cookies and YES... they take Visa! Prices very good by Calgary standards, portions large."}
{"text":"The service is BEYOND SLOW. Had to ask for water & tea. After 25 min. the spring rolls are still not here. No main dish either. Unreal this place moves at a snails pace. People do not have 2 hours to have lunch!!! We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE  The food is incredible and so are the staff. Shout out to Tommy who always takes such great care of me and my family. I have tried many things on the menu and never disappointed but a sure win is THE CHICKEN COCONUT CURRY SOUP.   If you come when it's busy you'll be waiting a long time because their kitchen is small. I say the food is worth the wait. Also the bathrooms are super nice. The whole restaurant is renovated and beautiful."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants! First thing everyone needs to know is that this is not the typical pho place where everything is premade and the food comes out in like two minutes. The food here actually takes time because everything is made pretty fresh. I feel like this is where most people feel frustrated, so it is good to have this as a heads up before you try Taste of Saigon.   I have tried many different dishes here, and I love it all! All their soup broths are always soo good. I love that they are super clean, the food tastes really fresh, and they've got some cool desserts and even alcohol. I've never had \"real authentic\" Vietnamese food from Vietnam before so I can't compare, but I love the food here. Definitely worth a try as long as you're not in a rush to down your food and run :)"}
{"text":"was there a few nights ago, 1st I do not think the owners are Vietnamese, which is ok but when it comes to pho... I'm not too sure that is a good thing. For a Pho style restaurant this is by far the slowest restaurant I have ever experienced. We just moved from Vancouver where there are tons of Pho restaurants and had low expectations on the taste but as that turns out it was actually not bad at all, however it's not worth waiting 45+ minutes for Pho. Maybe it ends up tasting better because you need to wait so long. All the other places I have been to have your bowl of soup on your table in 5 - 10 mins tops! I did ask them why they are so slow and the response was they make it different, which again is ok but I don't go to a Pho to wait for that long for a bowl of Soup.  Service was slow but friendly and they got our orders wrong but did fix it...in all we were there for 1 hours and 15 mins!  We will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Food is good. Too bad the service is so atrocious. Takes 15 min just to get water. Another 20 to get food. I don't know any Vietnamese restaurant that takes more than 30 minutes to bring out a simple bun dish! Don't come here unless you have a couple of hrs to spare."}
{"text":"The service is terrible here.  We were served undercooked chicken and when we told the server she argued with us.  We had another server come over and he continued to argue with us so that everyone in the restaurant could hear.  The chicken was pink and it was very obvious.  Also, the water to wash your hands in the washroom was not working and it was clearly not important to the servers to fix this.  We would not recommend this restaurant and definitely will never go back."}
{"text":"An unusual nuoc mam, less sweet with a savoury note, was an enjoyable component of several dishes. Honey grilled shrimp with broken rice was tasty and featured an over easy egg though the shrimp were overdone. Lemongrass chicken rice noodle bowl, green onion pancakes wrapped around fresh basil leaves and veggie spring rolls were enjoyed by my dining companions. Beef pho soup was served with all the proper accompaniments and sauces were on the table instead of having to be requested, both things not all Vietnamese  restaurants do. The servers were cheery and friendly, mostly making up for hit and miss service like forgotten orders and a long wait for drinks."}
{"text":"Yes, a high rating BC this ain't no regular Pho place!  Just opened 3 weeks, w/ modern, Martha Stewart-like decor, bright round white circles of light, and friendly, English-speaking staff.   Ordered their Beef Special noodle soup, flavorful without the MSG. It's a good sign that it didn't come out in a minute like some Pho places lol.   The lemongrass chicken was perfectly grilled, and good size portion of vermicelli noodles.   But what's impressive are the drinks. Complimentary glass bottle of water, like a hotel Resto would offer.   And the iced Vietnamese coffee comes in a mug, with smaller, slush ice, though not my preferred blocks of ice, still a nice touch because the ice came in a metal round container.   Recently moved from here to 8888 Country Hill Blvd."}
{"text":"Sauces taste like they are from a bag. The inside is nice and clean, staff is friendly...but lacks that homemade taste. Went to check it out, won't go back. There's too many good Vietnamese places in the NW to choose this one."}
{"text":"Meant to go to Smashburger, but due to the boyfriends epic hangover, decided on pho instead. I remember when this placed used to be in Silver Springs, across the street from my house. I loved the spring rolls and bubble tea, so I ordered those as well as a beef pho. The two employees working were quite young, and although the place was mostly dead, they took a while to take our order and seemed very rushed. Our food came out quickly & hot, and everything was really tasty. While we were eating, I overheard the two employees discussing a previous customer, and how she said it was the worst service she ever had. They weren't being rude about it, I just thought it was unprofessional to talk about in front of other customers. I hope they work on the service aspect of this place, as it seems that's what a lot of people have issues with. The food was good though. Might be back if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I experienced a Taste of Saigon last week for the first time. In the midst of a soul sucking \"power centre,\" it is nice to be able to step into a facility that doesn't have a chain restaurant feel.   My friend and I are both vegan, and when trying to place our order, the girl assisting us was a little confused. However, she then sent another gentleman over to look at the menu who was very helpful. The veggie spring rolls are not vegan with the regular egg wrappers, but upon request they wrap them in rice paper to make them vegan. Another thing on the vegetarian menu that is not vegan is the sub, as the bread is not vegan.   Anyways, we eventually came to a decision and tried the tofu salad rolls with peanut sauce, spring rolls wrapped in rice paper, veggie curry dish, and tofu veggie noodle soup. They even have imitation fish sauce here for the veggie dishes which is rad. Generally, the food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the salad and spring rolls, as well as the veggie curry dish. The soup was okay, but the tofu wasn't cooked to my liking and I prefer it at a few other places. The collateral was that I didn't have to be worried the whole time about whether my food was purely vegetarian because the staff here had a good understanding of that what we wanted. This was also more than enough food for two people to share and we ended up not actually finishing. We also drank lychee juice which was a tasty thing. For two people two share four dishes and drinks, it came to about $40.   As this is close to my workplace, I will definitely be back here again for some veggie curry and salad rolls!"}
{"text":"This is one of my number one restaurants in the NW... Not just for pho but for an excellent meal anytime of day. I have come for lunch, dinner, and late snack and they are open long hours which gives anyone the opportunity to come by. PLEASE don't come here if you want some quick disgusting \"fast food\" pho that comes out two minutes after you order it and has just been microwaved from the night before to reheat it. This is homemade quality fresh food that takes a few minutes to cook, but is very worth the wait.  The service is great, the staff is always friendly and greets you immediately. You are welcomed to sit at a large table and you are not crammed into a tiny table where you barely have elbow room.  My favourites on the menu are the Pork Dumpling, delicious crunchy veggie spring rolls, the beef soup, and the pork stew hot pot. Just delicious.  If you have more than 10 minutes to scarf down your food - Please give this place a try and understand that you are getting hand made delicious food that might take five or ten minutes but is so worth it."}
{"text":"I was a diehard fan of Taste of Saigon at their previous location.  While the food was great the service was hit or miss and candidly the facilities were a bit of a dump (looked like it had been furnished through garage sales).  Was a little bummed when they closed as they had a number of items on the menu I haven't seen at most other Vietnamese restaurants like the chicken dumplings and some other tasty appys.  So when I saw they were re-opening in Royal Oak I was kind of excited.    Tried them the other night and have mixed response.  Even though I had my order as take-out I did give the new digs a good look.  They're nice, has a sort of California bistro look to it.  Ordering was simple and the food ready when I got there (that was a pet peeve of the old location, they'd say 20 min for your order and never failed that you'd still be standing around 30 minutes after you called it in).  Got home and we dove right in.   The food was good but seemed not quite as flavorful as before.  Maybe I just got them on an off night or our tastebuds were slacking.  Not bad by any stretch just not quite as good as we remembered.  The menu is largely the same with only one change I noticed.  The salad rolls are now \"customizable\" (i.e. you can order them with your choice of protein (beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu)) and you order them one at a time.  Nice since I always found a full order (usually 3) was a bit much.    Definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese with a quick take out time. Some people don't understand the being closed on Tuesday thing though."}
{"text":"Had to update on the dessert they have in the restaurant - Taufu fah or soya bean jello, served hot but with a twist - there is a cover of basil seeds on the top of the Taufu fah and it comes with a little silver server that pours out the gingery sweet syrup.  Pour that over the dessert and delve into a cloud of warmness!  Cost is $5.50.  A little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Parking 5 out of 5 Service 4out of 5 Food 5 out of 5 Food is great especially #26 beef stew noodle soup & # 29 central Vietnamese beef noodle soup!  Only downfall is food takes a very long time to prepare. When ordering take out staff advise 25mins but you still wait when up u come to pick up for another 10-15mins. Give yourself lots of time when dinning in or taking out!"}
