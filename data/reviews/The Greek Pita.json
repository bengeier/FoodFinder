{"text":"Tried this place on a whim.   We ordered the #11 chicken gyro value meal and our little one had the corndog from the kids menu.  Very tasty but the cost was about $26 for two value items and a kids meal.   It seemed a bit pricy but the food was very good.   The location is off to the side of Best Buy so you need to know it's there.  Thank you Yelp!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Customer service and speed of order were great! Tzatziki Sauce is nowhere near authentic, was a bit too sour with no real taste of cucumber. Meat was slightly dry but oily??? Fries were good! I would give it one more try just to see if today was an off day but believe the Tzatziki sauce is what it is, poor at best."}
{"text":"AWESOME place for great food...my favorite is the chicken shawarma, which is served as a plate of hummus with wonderfully-marinated tender chicken bites, not wrapped in a pita as it often is.    Their 'greek salad' is to die for, and this makes my favorite meal when wanting to go to my  'happy place'!!   Self-order, delivered to table quickly and efficiently.  Prices are decent, and food has always been great no matter what we order.   Willing to drive half-way across town for it frequently!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu selections! I have eaten at the place several time and it is VERY delightful!  Its worth the drive if you live far! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Best gyros ever!!! The flavor and texture of each ingredient was absolutely perfect. The portions are really good too. They do not skimp. The people are very nice and the restaurant has a warm, cozy atmosphere. Located just west of the I-17 on the south side of Thunderbird next to the Best Buy, it is easy to find. I heard from a friend about this place and wasn't too sure since I thought other Greek restaurants were just okay. I'm so glad I did. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I can give this 5+ stars I would!! Best Greek food I've ever tasted! I get the #10..chicken is ALWAYS fresh and tasty and the garlic sauce is to die for! 10/10 would recommend! Been coming here as my new favorite spot and haven't been disappointed yet!!!"}
{"text":"The gyro salad is awesome.  The hummus is great too.  I hear that the chicken gyro salad is amazing too, but I can't bring myself to order anything other than that wonderful gyro salad.  I order it every time we visit!"}
{"text":"They were sitting at the table looking and continously  laughing  and we're very unprofessional  ...and we're too busy being on there phones and burnt my gyro ...I will not come back to this establishment  again"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite gyro place!  My mom lives right down the street and I miss coming here!  I come back whenever I am in town, their food is excellent!  The restaurant is always very clean and bright and the customer service has always been extremely awesome!  I cannot say enough good things about this place, I hesitate to eat gyros anywhere else!  My mom swears by the chicken gyros but I'm a purist and love the #1"}
{"text":"GREAT Gyros, the place is clean, friendly service and they move quick on the take out orders."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is wonderful, the portions are good and staff has always been friendly and attentive. My favorite item is not on the menu and they added it for me which is the hummus plate with steak kabob. Their hummus is super creamy smooth  and the steak Kabob is juicy big pieces. They also have some seriously yummy french fries and I am saying that as a french fry snob. Every time we go to Lowe's or Best Buy, we stop here and get it food to go. We have never been disappointed. My other half is from Germany and he is very picky about Gyros as he says they taste differently in Europe. This is one of the few places that he will get a gyro from as he considers it authentic tasting."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. It has really good food. Good customer service. And the food was nice and hot. The Greek Pita has earned my business."}
{"text":"I normally don't like Greek food although I eat it when the people I'm with are craving it, this place was actually delicious!  I will be coming back here of my own choice for sure.  I had the steak kebab pita."}
{"text":"Super greasy gyro, I mean absolutely disgusting. So many better options, I don't want to sound like I'm plugging another place so I'll just say go anywhere else and it will certainly be better. The young girl at the register obviously had some infatuation with the cook so I shouldn't have been surprised that when I called to tell them the state of the food I had been sold that she seemed irritated that I would expect something other that the garbage I was given. The other reviews that are positive are likely family of the owner or someone who typically eats greasy disgusting fastfood"}
{"text":"The chicken kabob plate with side salad and bread with garlic sauce is amazing. My family and I have become regulars."}
{"text":"If you're not looking for this place, then you'd probably miss it since its location is not necessarily a heavily trafficked area, off to the side as you enter the Best Buy plaza on Thunderbird and I17.   The place is small like the typical Gyro places that dot the valley but it's not plain looking like others.  They've definitely put more effort into the decor.  The menu is nicely laid out above the counter with plenty to choose from. Most of the selection are combo items but you can certainly buy individual or a la carte items.  The kitchen is open just behind the counter which was a nice touch because you can see the staff prepare your food.   Today I tried the #8 - Steak Shawarma meal consisting of the Shawarma, fries and a drink. It was delicious with a generous portion of meat.  I can't quite describe it exactly at first bite, but I think it was the flavorful tzatziki and the meat cooked just right that sent this Shawarma over all others as compared to similar places around this area.   Overall, thumbs up and worth returning to in the future."}
{"text":"Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting.  I wish they could just know by my # what I always order."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant.  I still love the garlic sauce. However, the last two greek salads with chicken that I got were terrible. The lettice was wilted and the cucumbers and tomoatoes were opaque as if they had been frozen. Only ended up eating the pita bread and garlic sauce and at $10.95 that is expensive bread."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Gyro, chicken gyro, tzatziki sauce, hummus...these are our favorites. The portions are large. There's always people eating here when we come--for good reason--yet the service is still quick and friendly. My husband and I are temporarily living in Phoenix and have become regulars at the Greek Pita. I wish we had one back at home, as we will definitely miss it when we leave."}
{"text":"This place is real authentic, I would know as I was raised eating Mediterranean food.  First you have to see are they really carving the lamb?  Yes, I saw it being carved from the meat rotator.  The cashier girl was really nice, the music was authentic mediterranean music, the food was great.  It was a heavy load of lamb gyro, which I love because I left feeling full.  The only thing is, I wish there was more taziki sauce on my gyro, other than that, excellent overall."}
{"text":"Pretty good gyros... What more can I say. The only downside to this place is the bread isn't always fresh, it definitely is premade."}
{"text":"I always love their falafel plate. Comes with rice and salad. I love the Greek hot sauce--$0.54 extra."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in this neighborhood! The Manager always takes great care of my family and has our orders memorized. This is one of the best Greek take outs in town."}
{"text":"Clean and efficient restaurant with some good food.  I had the Souvlaki (sp?) and an appetizer of hummus and a Greek salad.  The pork pita was awesome and I fully recommend, but the hummus was only OK.  I cannot put my finger on it, but I have had better tasting hummus and bread elsewhere. The taste and texture was not what I like and am used to. The bread was better than the hummus.  The salad was fresh and tasty.  A little pricy, but worth it."}
{"text":"Un-friggin-believeable!  In town on business and looking for something different.  Where I grew up we had a huge Greek Community and there were at least 10 Greek Restaurants in my area.  Tasting the food here reminded me of some of those restaurant.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  I will be eating there for dinner every day that I am here in phoenix.  Great Find!"}
{"text":"My friends and I come here all the time!  We recommend the gyros, chicken gyros, steak shwarma, falafel and any salad!  Always friendly, and always busy.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Good food. Hearty portions. My second visit here. Sad to say that I saw a large roach (belly up) on the floor on my way to the bathroom to wash my hands. That was a BIG turnoff. I know may say \"at least it was dead\". But still...yuck!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good!! I'm not saying the best, but I've been there quite a few times now and haven't had a bad experience. The food is good and is one of my favorite lunch spots on this side of town."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant once and I thought I had a great experience after the second visit. Had very very very poor customer service experience! The food was good but the service was discriminatory!"}
{"text":"Lamb gyro with fries are delicious. Really great flavor. And the gyros are big with alot of meat."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite Greek restaurant!  My husband and I come here at least every 2 weeks, sometimes more because everything is always so wonderful.  The food is hot and ingredients are fresh.  I always get the chicken shawarma salad and it is a monster!  It is loaded with veggies and comes with a pita and this delicious pink garlic dressing that is amazing!  My husband rotates between the steak shawarma, steak kebab and the gyro and has never been dissatisfied. The place is always clean and the staff is usually pretty friendly.  Adding to the cultural experience of the cuisine is the Greek music playing in the background.  All in all, a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"We order from here for lunch and it is excellent!    So far I have had the gyros which is very good, the spanakopita is what you would expect, but my favorite is the chicken kebab wrap.    I get it with the tzatsiki sauce, the chicken is cooked to perfection and with the tomato, lettice and sauce in a pita, it is perfect.     Great food!"}
{"text":"Amazing, my new favorite hole in the wall, I was shocked how good it was."}
{"text":"Best Greek food we had in ages. I spotted the Yelp sticker on the door. Wonderful, tasty food, Will eat there again soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It was our go to place for quick take out. We moved out of state and now can't find any gyros that come close. The gyros and steak shwarma were our favorites. This will probably be our first stop when we come back to town plus I want some of the pink garlic sauce to take home."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro greek salad. Fresh ingrediants! Brought back memories of our recent trip to Greece, very authentic!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything I've had here is excellent. Great falafel and hummus a d I'm a huge fan of the steak kabobs. I try to stop in and get a Greek chicken salad at least once a week. Great portions, good food, and they're always friendly. The place is always clean and maintained. I take everyone I know here, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My and my husband our 5 kids , mom and mother in law  went to this place . We spent over $60 on dinner buying meals , salads , drinks , and a couple of sides , hummus etc... My husband asked if we can have a side of sauce the \"  tzatziki \" beacuse his  chicken wrap was kinda dry , the Girl said Sure that will be 50 cents ...   50 cents what!!! after spending $60 she was chargeing us for a 2 cent sauce , wow so cheap and the food was  dry ...."}
{"text":"The real test for a Greek restaurant is whether or not you can please somebody who has never had Greek food. I brought my friend here for his first taste of Greece and he left satisfied. We both got lamb gyros and enjoyed them with their sides and tzatziki. I would recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"All I can say is that my family and I are totally addicted to the gyros here! The pita is stuffed with yummy gyros and all the fixings! The fries are always so hot and crisp!  We have seen other dishes that people have ordered and they always look so good! Since I don't get to come here as often as I like, I keep getting the same thing! One of these days, we will have to try something besides the gyros! :-D  By the way, the people who work here are super friendly! They always come by and check to make sure that we are happy with the food and to see if there is anything we need."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek in the state!!! The food is delicious the staff is beyond friendly. My favorite dish is the falafel plate I come here with my father and they some how remember our order and everyone else's order! And don't get me started on the baklava it is so good I could eat 15 of them! Love it here and will always be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Gyro Lamb is always very flavorful and tender. Shwarma Chicken is delicious. I have always been very pleased with the food and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to stop for gyros. I actually start salivating when I'm in the area! Other places I've been just don't stack up in comparison. The staff is always very friendly and happy to bring out my food, so I don't have to juggle my food and my toddler. Try their Greek fries in your combo if you like feta! This place is a staple in our house!"}
{"text":"This was the first time having a bad experience with Greek food. I ordered the steak shawarma and it was awful. At first I thought the service was great having my food ready and prepared within two minutes. After taking a few bites I noticed that the meat, lettuce, and even tomatoes taste old. The lettuce was soggy, the meat was hard, and the tomatoes were not fresh. It seemed as if it was prepared earlier in the day. To top things off, the food did not sit well in my stomach in the night. Very disappointed in Greek pita. Take the time and make fresh food for your customers!   I will not be returning. I will take my business to Greek wraps instead."}
{"text":"We use Yelp all the time to find places to eat. Saw the rating for this place and thought we would give it a try. Unfortunately the Yelpers got this one wrong or we caught them on a bad day. Lived in the Middle East for 5 years and really like the food but this was a real disappointment. I do have to say the lady at the counter was very friendly and genuinely seem liked she wanted to serve. We ordered  gyros sandwich combo, two falafel sandwich combos, chicken kabob plate, humus and baba ganoush to go. We were home in 10 minutes and began to eat.  The gyros was good, the chicken kabob was flavorful but dry. We had ordered an extra side of Tahini for the falafels  but for some reason there was none on the falafels themselves. They must have forgotten which added to making them pretty tasteless and dry. I love falafels but not these.   Fries were good to dry depending on the batch you ate from. The absolute worst was the pita bread they included for the bland boring hummus and plain baba ganoush.  It was some of the driest and chewiest pita bread I have ever tried to eat. Just terrible! They were pulling the pita out of bags at the diner so none of it is made there. Any way, not a great food experience. Certainly not a 4 star. Maybe 2 or maybe 3 stars if you give consideration for friendly staff. Not far from my home but I doubt we would go back. Too bad. Would have been nice to find a good pita place nearby."}
{"text":"I always recommend the chicken gyros with the pink garlic sauce. So delicious and haven't found another place with the same sauce. Good service, affordable and so tasty. One of my absolute favorites and better than most other fast Greek places."}
{"text":"Mi Amigos: This is a one star place based on the food. One extra star for the incredible woman (Go ASU) at the cash register. Now for the food Greek salad ($7) looked premade and left in the fridge. Poorly picked over lettuce with brown spots and stalks. Old tomatoes like they were sitting around for a while. However, if you are into quantity it is enough for two persons to share. Pita bread. The toughest, chewiest, thinnest bread I have ever had. Obviously mass produced (not in house). Baba Ghanouj ($4.50) bears NO resemblance to Baba Ghanouj. The main ingredient in Baba is eggplant, this was far from it, although the serving is quite large. Two choice platter, ($11.95) lots of rice, steak shawarma, tough, dried out and very little of it. Same with the chicken. The meat portion was miniscule and, Mi amigos, watch closely as he takes the meat out of the bottom of the grill drawer, precooked, and then grills it to death so it is dry nubs. Now for the killer. The food is dry, dry dry. The owner gives you a lot of food, but then has the cajones to charge 50 cents for a little container (1 oz) of tadziki sauce (weird pink color and not very good) If the salad had better lettuce and tomatoes, if we got some meat with the two combo platter, and it was not cooked till dry as the dessert, if the Baba tasted like eggplant and tahini, and if the bread was decent, this place might get 2.5 stars for the food and one star for the cash register sweetie."}
{"text":"I think this business is family owned. The employees are alway so sweet and patient. My self and my co workers constantly place large orders and they always provide awesome tasty meals. Sometimes they even walk the food over to Us Since we are next door at ulta. We love this place!!! I get the chicken shawarma and it is always perfect. Thanks Greek pita!"}
{"text":"It's delicious! The people are great and very friendly.   They're quick at having your food ready without falling short on quality!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect walking in.  Saw that they have 4 stars and thought that this would be a better option than the other fast food around here.   Person at the counter was very friendly, food is very good (had the gyro), very fast - even though they were busy for lunch.  Best sign of a place that cares - restroom was very clean. If I lived in town, I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the food was really good and flavorful. I will probably end up going more often."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Every time a friend comes to visit, I always take them here once during their stay. The chicken shawarma sandwich is my absolute fave. There is something about the sauce and bread that makes the whole thing amazing. Their fries are pretty tasty as well. The food gets you pretty full so I think you get your money's worth (under ten dollars for a meal). Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I absolutely love their steak kebab!!! Not to mention they have some of the best french fries I've ever had. Their gyros aren't bad either. Good prices and great people!!! And as a sidenote the restaurant dining room and bathrooms are very clean. As an added bonus you can watch the cooks in the kitchen make your food."}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite place to get gyros, they give you huge portions for a small price! And they load it with so much meat ahhh 10/10 would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite places to go!  The gyro is just simply yummy and the service and quality are always very consistent."}
{"text":"First time here. The wife and I had the pita sandwich. I had fries and she had the Greek salad. All was very good at a great price."}
{"text":"Not enough gryo meat on my sandwich... In chicago they give you enough meat for 2 pita sandwich. I miss Home.."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food. I have been to many Greek places but this is definitely one of my favorites. Great customer service and great food. Would definitely recommend it for others to try."}
{"text":"BEST Greek food in town! Im very picky when it comes to Greek/Mediterranean food and this place nails it. Everything is wonderful right down to the sauces. If I could eat here every day I would. The staff is super friendly and the prices are fair. If you are ever on the west side of the valley and want a delicious meal....be sure to stop by The Greek Pita!"}
{"text":"If you want the best Greek food in Phoenix you have to try \"The Greek Pita\", I just keep coming here and they never disappoint me.  The food portions are generous and always fresh. The employees are friendly and the tzatziki sauce is outstanding. Just wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Best Gyro ever! Great, friendly service, too! Fast and tasty! Clean restaurant, which was a bonus!"}
{"text":"Love love love the Greek Pita! A bit over priced but worth it... flavorful food, nice employees... never disappoints us... we only wish they didn't charge extra for \"extra\" dressing, especially when you're buying a large salad. Other than that, it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Some of the best greek food I've ever had. Portions are generous, and the flavor is incredible on everything I've had."}
{"text":"2nd time here. The food has been awsome on both occasions.. if your a gyro fan, do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Saw the high reviews and decided this was our spot for the night. Unfortunately, a big ok \"Meh, nothing special\". Was excited about the baklava, but it was the biggest disappointment of the meal - no honey, pretty bland, tasteless.  Gyro sandwich is packed full of gyro meat and the fries are surprisingly crisp and pretty tasty. Still, I've had better.   Not the worst experience, definitely not the best."}
{"text":"The steak shawarma with the pink garlic sauce is fantastic! The hummus, falafel, gyros, and Greek salad are great too!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Love this place!! Chicken kabob and gyro are my favorite, always taste fresh. Fries are some of the best too. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Customer service is low and I so badly want to give a five star rating because I seriously love their food. Their Greek fries are best I ever had. Best falafel too. But I recently had the worst experience where they gave my food to another customer then they blamed me.  It was as if the cook wanted me to leave without food saying I should have grabbed it when it was entirely their fault for letting the person take my food. The cashier lady was the only redeeming quality. She was sincere and friendly and apologetic. Honestly she saved them. They were completely rude and not deserving of service.  The cook was so angry at me for him giving away his food to someone else. I really hope he can l learn to run a business that is worthy of treating human beings with respect."}
{"text":"Another Greek favorite of mine! I get the chicken shawarma pita with feta and the garlic sauce...yummy!"}
{"text":"Ordered two Gyros.  They were both extremely greasy.   The manager would not replace them.  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We took gyros and the app sampler to go. Fast service and incredible food!"}
{"text":"Setting:  This quick eatery is located near our home in the Happy Valley shopping center.  Out of all the eateries in this area, my wife and I rank this place above the rest.  Ambiance:  Space is very limited although there is seating outside.  Typical fast food ambiance for take out or sit down.  However, it is not the ambiance that matters here, but the food is delicious!  Food/Menu:  My wife ordered the chicken kebab meal that comes with a drink and fries ($8.50) while I ordered the ultimate steak shawarma (sandwhich only $6.95, and you can also choose chicken).  We added 2 garlic sauces that cost $0.50 each.  Depending on how many people are there, the food does not take very long to come out.  Chicken Kebab - the chicken is seasoned well with great flavor, while the veggies and added garlic sauce in the pita bread compliment the meat.  The french fries are thick and are not too soft or too crunchy.  Ultimate Shawarma - the bread seems buttered with the right amount of crunch when you bite into it.  The steak, with the onions, tomato, and provolone combined make for a definite party in your mouth.  Tasty and savory sandwich.  This is a definite after party or late night treat!  Service:  They are family owned and do an excellent job of service.  No complaints!  Overall:  The prices were listed above due to the fact that you are getting quality sit down Greek food at a reasonable price.  I have not tried the whole menu yet, as I have not gotten sick of the shawarma.  Overall, this is better than average Greek food with a good price.  Out of all the eateries here, we will definitely be seeing you again Greek Pita!"}
{"text":"This is a quality spot!  Food is fresh, people are friendly, prices are pretty fair.  Pitas are delicious and fries are above average, I will be back!  Have not tried the hummus, but its hard to beat Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my BFF and we really like this place. It is clean, the prices are somewhat reasonable, and the service is nothing out of the ordinary. The food is made to order relatively quick and the Sherwarma Gyro is so delicious... that I feel guilty afterwards. But, it is well worth it!  I plan to frequent this place on a regular basis and love the fact that it is fairly close to work. I believe they have the best Gyro's in the Phoenix Metro area. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Since this place first opened its doors, hubby and I frequent Greek Pita at least once a week. The food is always delicious and I love that they have vegetarian options for me! Falafel and appetizer plates are my favorites. Service is always fast ad friendly. According to my meat eating husband, the meat options are also tasty. Don't forget to save room for baklava, its heavenly..."}
{"text":"4.7/5 stars  Excellent, my wife and I go here every week. The gyro sandwich, chicken kabab sandwich, gyro salad, and spanikopita are all great! Owner/Operator is very nice and prices are really reasonable. I've probably tried 10 greek places in the valley and this by far is the best!"}
{"text":"All of their food is EXCELLENT but when it comes to gyro sandwiches, which is why I go to a Greek restaurant, they are HUGE with plenty of tomato, onion, and tzatziki  sauce. I like several around town but for the money I haven't found more bang for my buck as when I went to this place. It is a regular bi weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"Okay so we go in one day after looking at best buy for a controller my boyfriend had to have for the ps3. We decided lets get something so he goes to port a subs and I go to the Greek pita which I though ah ill try it. The place was small but cozy staff is friendly and take out Woot. Needless to say I loved this place. My boyfriend hated port a subs was dissapointed. So we decided to come back so he could try it. He loves this place now too. We've been back several times and we've told friends about it. Awesome food!"}
{"text":"So, I came here with my friends one weekend for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised with this place. From the outside it does not look like much and is not very impressive, but once you step inside and smell the food your mind is quickly changed. Here is the break down:  Pros: 1. Food was delicious and filling 2. Prices are fair for the amount of food given 3. Staff was very polite and very quick about making our food  Cons: 1. The only problem I had about this place was space. It does get cramped in there so be attentive about how to best confront this issue when you have large parties.  Over all the food was awesome and the prices were great! I would definetly return there very soon and with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"UGH! Why am I such a masochist that I keep trying this place thinking it will get better? This place is close to my office, and there aren't many good \"healthier\" options nearby, so I've been here a handful of times over the past year or so, but I'm putting up the white flag and surrendering, I will not be going back.  First, they put way too many onions on their gyro. Don't get me wrong, I love onion, but I think they only buy the stinkiest, strongest flavored onions available. I feel like I wreak for at least 24 hours after eating a few pieces of those puppies.  Second, the falafel is SO SALTY! I can't even bring myself to consume one entire falafel. Also, on at least one occasion, there was a hair in the falafel. Enough said.  Third, prices! Hello! Have you heard of a lunch crowd? I really don't want to pay $10 for a salad outside of a sit-down restaurant, and even then it better blow my mind. Salads are also, unfortunately, one of the most edible things served here. The veggies are fresh and the oil and vinegar dressing is good and simple. The chicken salad would earn 3 or 4/5 on its own, but not for $10 at lunch!  I must try to keep this a little positive. The pita bread is delicious, served warm and soft, but unfortunately, cannot save the rest of my bad experiences here.  Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"It's a small joint but comfortable. I was hesitant about having Greek food but once I read what was on the menu...those falafels were all mine! Tasty and held their crunch within the pita bread covered in sauce, along with lettuce, tomato and onions. This Bronx kid's been missing his NYC food variety so this was a welcomed treat. Yummy, yummy, Eddie Machete had food in his tummy!"}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about this place!!  It's a small restaurant in a strip-mall, but the food is real and delicious.   I ordered the falafel plate, which came with salad, rice, pita, & tzatziki.   My niece ordered the steak shawarma wrap w/Greek fries. She was super happy with her meal.   The portion sizes were very generous and we both ended up bringing enough food home for a 2nd meal.   Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out here twice.  Both times were very positive.  First time I tried it was when I first moved here in the Spring when it was like 100 degrees already.  I have 2 dogs that I had to leave in the car (with the engine and A/C on) while I ran inside to place my order.  I told the waitress I'd just be outside the door because of my dogs so I'll come in to get my food.  Instead of waiting for me to come in to get it....she came out and handed to me!!  How nice!  Second time I came here was a few days ago when the temperature has cooled down a lot. But, again, I left the dogs in the car with the engine on and the A/C going.  And AGAIN!....she ran out and gave me my food!    I love their service and their Sherwarma gyro is freakin awesome-tastic."}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN SHAWARMA! My very favorite place for greek. Get the chicken shawarma pita, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not a good night for this place.  Greek salad side - brown wilting lettuce, soggy salad mess overall Falafel - terrible. overspiced, grainy tasting and bad mouth feel Falafel sandwich - poorly constructed with watery tzatki sauce, brown lettuce.  Plus, in most of their chicken gyro's, they use mixed dark and white meat. Better to ask. Way better places out there. Since my last visit, something happened. Not good."}
{"text":"This isn't Greek food, I'm really not sure what kind of food they serve here ?! The food tastes stale and old !! Yellow rice tastes Awful !! Don't order it !! The cashier (girl with short red hair ) is plain rude, she seems to be yelling at people waiting in line apparently !!! I say go elsewhere !!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for leading an out of towner to a delicious spot! Staying in a nearby hotel it was a quick drive.  I had already made up my mind but once in there I started to waiver... For a Monday at 730pm there was a good crowd and the booths were all taken but I was happy to see it was a counter order. I hate eating by myself so I wanted it to go.  Steak kebab sandwich. Yum. Meat was in nice bug cubes. It was perfectly cooked and tender. I was glad that I brought it back to the hotel room because I made a mess eating it and enjoyed every morsel. It must be good when the light sauce they use runs down your arm a bit. The stuff in my cheeks...hey, I was saving that for later.   I got a side of tzaki sauce and hummus.  the tzaki was great on the fries. And hummus WA thick and rich. I wish I had left some bread to eat it with!  Fast service and nice person in the register who brought me my food.   I might make it back again this week to try the shwarma!!"}
{"text":"Lots of people love Greek food and I can see y the pita bread formerly known as flat bread the garlic sauce was ok I'm not a hug fan of this but my brother and my sister in law love it and for that reason I give them a 4"}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and wanted dinner to take back to my room. I was excited to find Greek food nearby. I ordered the falafel salad. In the 5 minutes it took to get to my room, the small mound of lettuce was soggy. The falafel were hard, dry balls. The tahini sauce had no flavor. The pita was good and was my dinner!"}
{"text":"Outside of NYC street cart pita, this is the next best thing. Loaded with meat, free refills, and an excellent environment. Staff friendly - though i wish they would start a loyalty card - this is the ONLY place i have pita in AZ.   Sub the fries for their rice in the combo meal. A little more expensive than other places, but you pay the premium for the better food.  PLUS, when you are done, you can walk it off at Lowes, across the street."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Such an unassuming sign out front, you'd never guess the inside held the best gyros sandwiches and chicken salads. You won't regret trying this place! :)"}
{"text":"Best chicken kabobs.  I love this place. I crave their food at least once a week. Yummy and nicely priced."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love their chicken gyro, as well as the steak. The lady who serves during lunch is helpful and nice. Always clean, and surprising random stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been there several times and I don't have any complaints.  We've always gotten our food in a timely manner and it tasted good. Prices are reasonable as well.  I'm no connoisseur of greek food (or any food for that manner) but I did find myself craving a gyro from them on more than one occasion.  I found this place to be much better than another nearby pita establishment.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"By far the best gyro greek place around this area.   and best for your money.   Best food, and fast friendly service.   Also one of the only gyro store around here that still puts out tabasco.... i miss it in the greek patio and chicago gyros."}
{"text":"I'm writing this while I'm eating another Greek place's food because that's how much I am craving and missing The Greek Pita at HV. First off... that pink sauce though . I could swim in it. By far the BEST Greek fries I've ever had. Loaded with feta and I dip them in the pink garlic-y sauce. I actually started ordering the chicken gyro since it's gyro style. It's seriously amazing and always fresh and filling. I've been eating here since like 2010 no joke."}
{"text":"Very good Greek food. Very pleasant staff. One of our favorite places. Good Fast food."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to find, but it is a treasure to be found!  We go here at least once every other week!  This is a family owned business which makes it even better, but our favorites are the traditional gyro, chicken or steak schwarma and especially love the garlic sauce.  Out of all the gyro-type places we have been to, this is our absolute favorite, nothing else compares!  The prices are a smidge more than normal, but it is well worth it!  We are for sure customer's for life!!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro sandwich which was quite good but my wife had the #10 Chicken Kebab which contained a very small amount of chicken.  Prices on their web site (thegreekpita.com) menu are wrong."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. They were very fast with the preparing the food. It has been a long time since I had a gyro and this one did not disappoint. Small sitting area for dining in. It cost $8 for a gyro, fries and a drink. I will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's hard to notice when getting screamed at by a crazy blond (poor dye job) woman named Nadia.  It was my brother's birthday and we decided to order catering from these guys. We looked up their website and found that half a tray of gyros was $55. We called to place our order and nadia asked what kind of meat we wanted, we said half chicken half beef. Apparently that makes our order $15 above the original $55, which is fine, except she didn't tell us the price was different and neither did their website. (Hopefully the site has been updated) We pick up our order and take it home only to find a stack of chewy pita bread and a box of dry meats. Nothing else! I'm pretty sure gyros usually come with more than that, and the bill was over $75. We called the restaurant and asked why our order was like this and nadia got on the phone and started screaming that we were stupid $!#@, %#! $ idiots etc. After cussing and screaming at us, she hung up. We called back asking for the manager and left a voice mail because they couldn't get them on the phone. The manager gave us a refund of the $15, but that crazy woman was there when we came to pick it up and she started to argue and got crazy again. Finally the manager told her to stop it and go into the back.  We used to love the food here but we feel like we can't go back because they will probably spit in it. The crazy woman made it very clear that she knew my family's name and she would be watching for us. Honestly, I feel we were lucky that we weren't physically attacked as well as verbally assaulted."}
{"text":"Come here one or twice a month. Fantastic meal every time we eat here! Friendly staff as well! Always clean."}
{"text":"This little restaurant in the Happy Valley shopping center, South side of Happy Valley, is a tiny gem. The food is flavorful and plentiful. The prices are very reasonable. Love the chicken shwarma on anything. The gyro meat is particularly tasty, well seasoned without losing the meat variety. The pita bread is just the right texture. You order at the counter and they will bring it to your table, or call your number if they're really busy. The variety of possible sides and sauces is good and the fries were amazingly good. Crispy on the outside and soft inside, not soggy, not too crunchy. Completely worth finding, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here because my other gyro place (43rd and third) was packed.  The girl at the counter taking orders was terribly rude, not only to me but every person in line after me.  Food took less than 10 minutes to come out.  I like that you can see into the kitchen when it's being made.  The gyros were delicious.  The falafel were NOT.  They were burnt and tasted terrible, same with the hummus. So if you're coming here strictly for gyros, it's a good choice"}
{"text":"LOVE the Gyro plate. Addicted. Love this place! Great food, great people, excellent service, decent prices. Always busy at lunch, a great sign!"}
{"text":"The food here is solid and the quality of the ingredients is better then average. The staff is nice and its refreshing to support a family owned and operated business."}
{"text":"After a morning at the range this is our standard lunch and debrief spot. Over the years my buds have tried pretty much everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. I'm a creature of habit and always get the chicken shawarma salad or the gyro salad. Both offer quality meat on fresh greens, onions, tomatoes  and feta cheese.  The staff is always friendly and they take the time to visit a bit with you while ordering. They are surrounded by several other restaurants but this is the place we eat at every time."}
{"text":"There are 3 things that make this place amazing; The seasoned chicken, the amazing garlic sauce, and Nadia at the front register! If i could get a hand on their secret recipe for that garlic sauce, i would put it on everything! But i have to admit, I have recently moved to Tempe and they have a location here, but it is not the same without seeing Nadia at the front register greeting me by name every time I come in! Still worth the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm so glad I happened to find this place by accident one day after going to Best Buy.    I'll admit, I'm not sure what traditional 'greek' food is to be honest, but I know I like this place.  The gyros are EXCELLENT and their hummus is THE BOMB!  Big servings, clean but small place, and quick.  I can get in and out of there in about 30 minutes, so easy for lunch.    I've seen some comments on the prices, but the prices are fine with me, especially considering that this stuff is grade A quality fresh.    You know, on that subject; one thing I've noticed is that a lot of white people...and it is mostly white people... white people with money...tend to beaaach a lot about prices in ethnic family owned restaurants.  Whether it be Mexican or Greek, they sure to like to complain about a few extra bucks.  But by golly get some funky new hamburger joint, like five guys, where they charge over $10 bucks for a hamburger and fries (no drink), and they just LOVE the place (must be those damn peanuts...)  Seriously folks, quit being such whiners about the price of food when it's anything but your standard American corporate white food.  Whether it's Asian, Mexican, and evidently now Greek, you are a bunch of cheap buggers who have no problem dropping money on some 'currently in and hip and new' hamburger joint (or any other corporate restaurant that is currently dropping their loads via new chains all over the US), but pay an extra buck or two for something else...you scream about getting screwed over because of the price.  Give it a break folks, and stop being so damn cheap.  Also, the staff is friendly, and I think they are actually greek... which is a good thing I guess.  They're all kind of hot also, including the guys...which never hurts."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place..Yummy food, very friendly staff, well maintained place!!! Definitely going again!!"}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit. I either get the gyro sandwich or the gyro salad.  Always yummy, always fresh and flavorful.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. The girl that looks like a budget jasmine made a rather inappropriate comment about who paid."}
{"text":"Love the gyro salad.  Location is clean and cute.  Staff are always friendly. The selection looks amazing, they did a great job with their big picture menu.  Someday I'll try something else, but I keep going back for my favorite salad!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is my favorite. This place was good. I had the Lamb Gyro with french fries. The gyro was great! The fries were okay. They are not the same fries they show in the picture. Although I was slightly disappointed by the fries, I would eat there again. Customer service wasn't bad, but definitely not excellent.  I give the ladies room five stars!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Gyro's. Quality Great food. Satisfying portion size. Prompt service. Being from the East Coast and having eaten gyro's many times and from many places I can highly recommend this establishment. I'll go there again."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and came promptly after ordering. The reason I didn't give higher stars is the cashier/server Brandi, had a bad attitude. She was huffing at customers, walked right by with the trash can, almost ran into me and rolled her eyes.....instead of saying excuse me. Part of a good restaurant is good customer service."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Awesome stop for a quick lunch. Great value--they give you so much food for a very reasonable price. My husband had the gyro and I had the steak schwarma. Both were very good, but the gyro is where it's at! I look forward to our next visit when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Great food authentic you can see into the kitchen and nice and clean the seating area is comfortable and updated the service is professional and friendly and the food is good"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The gyros can't be beat... and the fries are good too.    It's a tiny little place so it's best to not go at the busy times, like noon on a weekday, because seriously... the line is out the door."}
{"text":"Usually this place has really good service, very nice employees and their food is delicious. Today, I ordered by phone a combo plate with chicken kabob and chicken gyro like I have always ordered. The person taking the order took this as I wanted 2 separate plates. She found out that I only wanted one combo plate and became very frustrated with me. She made me feel really bad even after I had apologized for something that really wasn't my fault but, I understand miscommunications. Anyways, it a damper on the day and I probably won't be back:/ Again, food is great!"}
{"text":"The Greek Pita is a must try. Great food at a good price, and the service is quick and friendly. I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Come here sometimes when I have business at Best Buy. Always consistent and tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped in one afternoon and ordered some baba and a chicken salad. The baba was good, and served with a ton of pita quarters. The salad was good too, except that most of the chicken was burnt.  The cashier was pleasant and must be related to the guys doing the cooking. They were giving her a hard time about a male customer who I guessed must come in a lot and she was giving it right back to them! Kinda funny. I will definitely be back for takeout and lunch again while shopping. I will go for the gyro salad next time though."}
{"text":"We found this place with a yelp search and it was absolutely amazing! The lady taking our order was so friendly and didn't mind at all that my husband had a million questions . The food was out of this world good!! When they ask if you want extra sauce, get it!!"}
{"text":"Had heard from an employee in nearby Best Buy that this place was really good.  Today stopped by to see for myself.  Yep! She was right in spades.  Had a gyros sandwich.  It was tops!   Real Gyros is made from lamb or lamb/beef mixture.  Some other places leave out the lamb or lamb and beef and replace it with pork 'cause most people don't know the difference.   Lady taking the order was very nice and efficient. Prices were very good.  The sandwich with fries was almost more than I can eat and believe me, I can eat. Menu was also very extensive.  Hard to know what I'll get next time but do know this:  \"I'll be back.\" That you can take food out helps on those days or rather evenings when we're all huddled around the TV watching a football game or something.Everything was really great."}
{"text":"Absolutely awsome place , food was fresh and so tasty , i love the staff , so friendly and professional, i highly recommended this great restaurant, lots of great choices on the menu , i tried the steak shawarma, it was delicious, im so happy i found this place , thank you for amazing food and service"}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the Greek party, and I've always seen this place kind of tucked away behind Best Buy when I'd drive by.  Today some folks from work and I had a Greek craving and wanted to try something new.  So I figured why not....  Food was very good, the service was friendly, and the place was pretty full of people.  Everyone in our group was satisfied.  A great addition to the lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"The combo plate with chicken skewers and steak shawarma is our go-to meal. The garlic sauce and Greek hot sauce are some of the best sauces I have had at a Greek restaurant. Nadia is always sweet and takes such great care of our family! A must try if you're in the Norterra area! Their gyros are fantastic as well. :)"}
{"text":"I love this spot because... 1. The staff/owners are happy.  2. GREAT customer service.  3. Great food.  4. Clean.  5. Love the garlic pink sauce.  6. Totally accommodating for little kids/high chairs.  7. Again...staff is happy and happy to help in any way! 8. GREAT PITAS TOO!!!! Love how they come out."}
{"text":"This place is OK but a little over priced.  After ordering one gyro and a gyro meal with a side of hummus for two people, the total came to $19.  If you get the hummus as a side, I would recommend you get a pita or something because a side of hummus is just that, a side of hummus.    The gyro was not all too bad but they doused it in tzatziki (sp?) so contrary to the other reviews, mine was not dry at all but rather too saucy.  Once a little was scraped off, the gyro didnt taste too bad at all.   All in all a good place to go during lunch if you are over in this area and you want to avoid all of the restaurant chans that populate this area"}
{"text":"I love this place! I can't speak to \"authenticity\" but I know what I like, I like Greek food, and these guys make some of the best I've found in Phoenix. Who cares if they also have hamburgers on the menu? (I can't believe the things Yelpers will \"ding\" a business for... come on people, you're not writing for Zagat). Back to the food. I'm a big fan of Pita Jungle, but the food here is better. True, the place isn't big, and it might not be the best atmosphere if you need to bring a bunch of people from work or something; but for lunch, or take-out, or small parties, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is really good food. Greek food should be called soul food because you always walk away from the table feeling so good. The gyros plate is the best!"}
{"text":"I had a decent gyro and fries.  The baklava was dry and lacking in any specialty."}
{"text":"As a long term customer I am sad to report the cook got the order wrong which I am ok with. Instead of correcting it he became loud and unprofessional. Not cool! The young lady at the register was kind and apologetic. Sad he has no understanding on how he gets paid."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Greek lunch spot.  I recommend the chicken gyros combo, the gyro combo  and the chicken gyro salad.  My friend always gets the streak kabob and says it's great also."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I usually get the #1 or the chicken gyro(forgot the number).  I also really like the chicken gyro salad!  So filling, I never finish it.    Also - The staff is always great.  Place is always clean."}
{"text":"We went there a little after they opened, maybe 10:30 am.  I ordered the chicken kebab plate and my husband the two meat entree with gyro and steak. We got our food pretty quickly and they seemed to have steady business. My chicken was so juicy and very well marinated. I tried my husbands food and the meat was all very tasty.   The plates were served with rice, a pita and a side greek salad. The rice was very yummy. And the pitas were hot and fresh. We ordered extra garlic sauce to dip the meat/pitas in, and it was awesome!  We've been eating here for five years now and the food never disappoints. Its been consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and was looking for a gyro place close to me. I've been here two times now and how this place is so highly rated completely bewilders me. Gyros meat tastes ehh, tzatziki lacks flavor and frys were ehh. Not worth the money at all. Chicago gyros is still the best I've had in town."}
{"text":"Since my first review I've had the lamb gyro like 3 more times (at least), plus the chicken gyro. I like the lamb better. I've also had the Greek fries a couple times and those are pretty good too. This last visit I tried the Italian beef combo and it was also pretty dang good! I haven't had anything bad yet so I'm updating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I thought this place was decent. It's my first time stopping in today and I got the #1 which is a beef/lamb mix gyro with Greek fries instead of regular. The gyro was good, that's about all I have to say about it. The fries were extremely Limey/lemony (not sure which they use). I've had Greek fries only one other time and they were delicious. Can't say the same for this place. They were also $2 extra. Really? For feta and lime? Whatever. I might stop back in again if I'm in the area, but I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. I enjoyed it though."}
{"text":"The gyro plate is delicious. This a gem in a jammed shopping center.  Good food, good service."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new place to get a good gyro ever since I moved to the North Valley, and I finally found it! The Greek Pita is amazing all around. Here's a breakdown:  The Food: The gyros are to die for! They're piled so high with meat, onions and loads of sauce! Be sure to order your gyros with EVERYTHING. The fries that come with it are pretty tasty too!  The Service: The lady up front that takes your order is super cool and very sweet. The wait time for your food is pretty short. I went during a busy Sunday lunch (they were packed) and it was only about 5 minutes and I had my food.   The Restaurant: It's really nice inside! Outside, it looks like an everyday Valley strip mall, but inside it's very nice and cozy.   The Price: It's about the same here, as it is everywhere else you go to get Greek food. In comparison to Athens Gyros on Northern and 23rd Ave, it IS a little more expensive at Greek Pita. However, you get quite a bit more on your plate with Greek Pita.   Overall, this place is a must visit if you're looking for a good Greek place in Happy Valley. I'm giving it four stars, only because it's the best in the North Valley, but I'm not quite convinced it's the best out of the entire Phoenix area."}
{"text":"After visiting my lovely sister and new nephew at Thunderbird, we were looking for a quick and easy place to eat.  The Greek Pita hit the spot!  We had hummus and gyros - Yum!  Hummus was flavorful, and the meat was tastey.  The pita was a little stiff, but that was the only complaint.  Next time we're in the area, we'll stop here for quick eats!"}
{"text":"Our go to when it comes to greek food. Great size portion and fresh produce. We eat here at least 4 times a month. We tell anyone that is looking for greek food our found go to. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"The food is great, however the service on Monday evenings are horrible. This is the second time with the same young lady who takes my order, and after taking my money the cooks will sit down and make you wait 30-40 min. The first time I had no idea and I asked why is my order taking so long? The ticket was never given to the cooks.!\" I waited over 30 min for her to even notice my son sad and sitting at one of the tables. I was the only one sitting with my son. I was really upset when I waited so long and I asked for a curtesy drink and she refused.   The second time after 2 months, the same thing happens. Now I had to take it personal. Same girl. Long hair in a pony tail early 20's. She even asked me what nationality I was? How is that relevant to me getting my food?  I pray they fire that girl and have a new person who is kind and loving to customers. There is another woman there and she is kind. Be smart and place your order over the phone. It's sad that a group of people will try to ruin a good business. I hope the owner reads this and looks at the cameras to really see how they treat people.    Money is Green and that is the only color you should worry about. They do not like Hispanics, African Americans or Greeks here! Never again.   Please owners take care of a good thing and really understand who you have working directly with customers."}
{"text":"I had the #3 Steak Kebab sans lettuce for $9.13. They gave me a drink and a few fries along with the kebab in the pita. They pile in a massive amount  of the steak cubes garnished with onions, tomatoes and this sauce. I didn't really care for the sauce and will have to try this without the sauce. This is a comfortable place indoors with nice wooden tables and chairs. There is limited outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The Greek Pita never fails! I've been coming to this location since they opened and they turned me on to Greek food.  They have by far the best Garlic sauce for their pitas. I wish I could buy it by the bottle!"}
{"text":"I went to this location during the week for lunch and had the #11 Chicken Gyro.  I thought it was kind of over priced when paying but when I saw how much meat was piled on and the large amount of fries, I think it was worth it!  The meat had so much flavor and the onions and sauce were awesome!  Mine was very saucy and not dry at all!  I loved it so much I brought my husband here the following Saturday.  I had the same meal and it was equally as good.  This time I saved half because it was wayyy to much food for 1 meal.  My husband had the #3 Steak Kabob.  Steak chunks were huge and flavorful.  Smaller than the gyros, but just as good.  More authentic Greek and blows Pita Pit and those type places out of the water.  We go to a lot of places in this strip mall and the meals are about the same price as Bajio, Jersey Mikes and Panda Express.  The price is average for the amount of food.  I would like to eat here once a week and try different items."}
{"text":"This area of Phoenix is a desert for good ethnic foods.   This place has some of the best Mediterranean fast food you can find in Phoenix. Very good and not over seasoned Gyros. Shawarma is not bad, and Souvlaki is good too. Pretty much everything on the menus is a winner.  Portions are very large, especially on the salads. Prices are decent. Strangely enough they even serve Chicago style hot dogs.  It would be nice if they had more seating and at lunch time service can get a little slow. But be patient and wait."}
{"text":"It's cool and dark inside. Perfect when it's 120 out. It's clean and modern, the staff is friendly enough.  The food is tops. If anything, you get a lot of it, and that makes it decent value. I got a gyro, as per usual. The meat was a little bit thin but it was cooked well and there was a whole lot of it. The taste is good and the pita was relatively soft.  The fries are boring, but they're not bad. I just feel like there's room to do SOMETHING more, even for the basic fry.  It's no Haji Baba but it's definitely my new favorite gyro place near work. So not a must have, but definitely a first choice come lunch time."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've ever had. Ordered the Souvlaki combo. The Pita  was fresh and the meat juicy and perfectly spiced and cooked. Pure nirvana. French fries were delicious, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Ask for the \"Hamburger Sauce\" on the side. It makes a great dipping sauce for the Fries. Loved the ambience of the place which is rare for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Surprised at so many great reviews.  The restaurant  was clean, the workers were friendly, and the food was fresh... unfortunately  the steak shwarma pita was dissapointing.  The flavor, saltiness, and toughness of the meat specifically is what was so dissapointing."}
{"text":"This is a great place for fast food Greek food. Delicious shawarma, Huron, falafel and many other treats. Staff is very friendly. I live 3 minutes from this place, so this place is a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly staff. Delicious food. Cooked to perfection. Nice atmosphere.  I love this place. Yum."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food and wonderful service. It's a family run business and the food is fabulous. If you're in the area and craving Greek food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"We go to Greek pita weekly. We drive across town for the best counter service greek we can find. This place is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is \"The Best\" Greek restaurant in town. I lucked into finding it because I worked close by. Definitely worth the trip out there!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food Greek chow spot in NoPho. Nothing so amazing that it has me running back or craving it randomly. Good selection of iced teas. Tasty hummus & dolmas.   I'd like to see a non-falafel meal option for vegetarians. Perhaps a greek salad/pita & hummus/rice plate?"}
{"text":"I am a fan of eating Greek food regularly  I found this place when I moved to the area a while back... it's my go to for Greek food in Phoenix  I love the Greek pita , they are family owned and friendly. They never disappoint and I can be a bit picky about Greek food  Good food at a great price"}
{"text":"Been a very loooooooooooooooong time since I've been searching for a Gyro  that's so original that Zeus himself would himself for!!!!! Lol  gljust get the the Original Gyro with tomatoes  and onions... DONT PLAY YOURSELF ???"}
{"text":"Chicken Schwarma Salad served with a warm fresh pita bread-heaven. They give you a LOT of food for your buck, and it is so delicious. I am still trying to duplicate their pink garlic sauce, I love that stuff!"}
{"text":"First time I have eaten at this location. Was surprised at how dark it was to start with. The menu boards were nice if not expansive and therefore confusing. The prices were a bit steep for the quality of food. The meat was quite greasy. Salad way over dressed. Overall it was just ok. Then about 15 min later the whole party I was with started feeling sick. Will not be coming back to this location again I think."}
{"text":"While I felt like a traitor to my beloved King Gyros right down the street (43rd Ave/Thunderbird), I tried The Greek Pita, and they have dishes that compete with King Gyros. The flavor is different, and I absolutely love the garlic sauce. The service is pretty consistent, and food portion is average to slightly generous. There is another location by my work (Norterra area), which makes it convenient for wanting good Greek food on a lunch break. I would say their chicken schwarma is my go-to at this place, but I have tried other items. With the amount of selection available here, you'd have to visit quite a few times to get a good feel of the entire menu."}
{"text":"Great gyros and at only $5.50 for sandwich only a great value. Fries are good but I'm not a fries person. Gyros are loaded with meat and very tasty. This is my favorite place for them. This is far better than the pita jungle chain. I get the extra sauce for 50 cents as it is yummy. Had the Greek salad one too and it was great. Recommend."}
{"text":"The shawarma and gyros are delicious. The fries are always crisp. Counter service is generally very good."}
{"text":"The pita was good and the fries were fine. The greek salad was only so so. The iced tea tasted like water.  I brought it up.  They checked the machine and said it was fine. My mom tasted it and agreed.  She told the cashier when he brought our food and he didnt pay attention.   When i went to talk to him at the counter 2 or 3 times, he was always chatting with other workers in the kitchen & not paying attention."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm one of the many to stop by this place after leaving Best Buy, but thankfully I did because I just loooove this place!   I ordered the chicken shawarma combo (chicken shawarma sandwich, fries and a drink) and out of all the Mediterranean restaurants I've been to - this place definitely serves the largest portion. I mean, HUGE portions of meat and a basket of fries - so because of that, I can understand why their prices are a tad bit more than your usual gyro shop. Side note: they charge you for the sides as well ($.50 each). The food is great and it's unfortunate this place is tucked in a corner behind Best Buy.  The best part of the whole restaurant is the lovely girl who takes your orders. She's not just nice to you... she's nice to EVERYONE who walks in - just a very bubbly, energetic, sweet girl.   All in all, I wish this place was more popular because they deserve it."}
{"text":"My new go to place for Gyros especially on a Sunday. Their chicken schwarma (may be misspelled) is one of kind. Highly recommended for those looking for Mediterranean style for in North Phoenix. Eat in or pick up , either way they'll get it too. Items start around $8 and up, but definitely worth it. Also their house dressing has this distinct pink color to it but it just the same with little color added."}
{"text":"Seriously addicting!!! Their tzatziki sauce is on point!! Even my 2 year old loves it!!! So glad we moved closer to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice clean place, average pricing & yummy Gyros!"}
{"text":"I have not been back to The Greek Pita since my last review and a few things have change.  Their food is still very tasty and their restaurant is very clean and inviting.  However the quality of their service has gotten worse and they have raised their prices.  On this visit I ordered a Gyros combo but wanted them to sub the fries for a salad.  They stated it would be an additional charge and with this combo at $7.95 already I was hesitant but went ahead and ordered the side salad.    This Kronos Gyros was very good, juicy and full of flavor.  My salad was average and needed more dressing and cheese and certainly not worth the extra up-charge.  After paying just over $10 for just an average meal that should have cost between $7 and $8 I decided to drop my rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Yum. Delicious. Fast. Nuff said. It's a small restaurant but the food is so good love the sauce and the shawarma is my favorite. I eat here all the time."}
{"text":"They are friendly and the place is clean and the atmosphere is casual.  The Greek salad, hummus and baba ganoush are very traditional. I would agree with another reviewer statement that the salad was overdressed and had a little too much vinegar for my liking. The falafel was very salty. It would be nice if they would reduce the salt.  The portions are generous and they have a pink garlic sauce that is a fun twist on the traditional Greek sauce. The Kefka was dry and underseasoned. Not the worst I've had, but not the best either."}
{"text":"Greek Pita is conveniently open a little later than most other gyro places in the area so it was my destination for an 8:30 late dinner. Good choice! The gyro pita sandwich was very tasty as were the crispy fries, for which it was suggested I dip them in tzatziki sauce. Great idea! I still give the edge to George's but Greek Pita is a great stop too."}
{"text":"I've been here about 15 times since they opened years ago. Today the service was distracted but okay. The falafel was a little bland for my taste. The Tahini was bland as well. The gyro plate was about average. The portion sizes were a bit small for what I paid. A bit \"pricey.\"  The salad was the best part of the meal but was not as fresh as in the past. The bananna pepper was a bit rank in the salad. The rest of the salad was fresh. It was well air conditioned which is good. They forgot to give me the tahini that I paid for but they were quick to get me some after I brought it to their attention. I had to wait in line for a few minutes to ask for it. Overall it was okay. I will probably come check the place out again in another year or so to see if they've gotten any better. Lol."}
{"text":"Excellent little place for a great lunch. Love the chicken shwarma salad.  This place gets busy at lunch, but very much worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food and the people behind the counter are very nice. The place is very clean and they always give Quick Service. The Greek salad is really really good."}
{"text":"I just went in for the first time because I was craving some hummus. The place was clean but reeked of the smell of grease from the fryer...I just showered and now my hair smells like old french fries! The food wasn't bad, I got a falafel pita which was pretty good, they put a little too much sauce on it, though, so by the time I brought it home to eat the pita was kind of soggy. For me, the hummus was missing something, it was a little on the bland side. I don't think I'd go back for the hummus, but I'll probably go back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I eat from here at least once a month, and I absolutely love their Souvlaki plate. The portions are huge and the prices more than reasonable. The place itself is small and always busy, which is why I usually take my food to go. The employees are all very friendly and promote a great family atmosphere for casual dining. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  I enjoyed my rice a lot.  Wish I ordered a chicken kabob vs shawarma.  No toum but they had a tzatziki.  You place your order at the front and seat yourselves.  Problem was there was only one high chair and it was in use and we had two children.  Kinda weird they serve their food on disposable plates.  It worked in a pinch as we were on the road."}
{"text":"the staff here is always friendly. The food is delicious and comes out quickly and is hot. The place is clean and I always make a point of coming here when nearby."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. Authentic Greek taste. Chicken kabob pita is excellent. Saffron rice has excellent flavor. Small place but does a lot of business. Very good value for the amount of food you get. I recommend this place if you like Greek fast food style."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite Greek restaurant by far.  Pros: Everything is good here.  I've never had a bad meal.  I am picky about salad dressing and I love theirs.   The lady at the register is super nice and sweet. If you ask, they will give you the thick pillowy pita instead of the thin at no extra charge.   Best hummus imo Big portions- my mom and I usually share a meal here and end up full.  Cons: None"}
{"text":"By far my favorite lunch time stop! From the moment you walk in the door there is this welcoming atmosphere. Greeted by the warm smile of the woman up front followed by the tight nit team working to prepare a delicious meal for you. The menu is clear as day and priced just right. The food is beyond AMAZING! I usually stick to the #11 (chicken gyro meal) and it never disappoints with fresh cooked meat, crisp veggies, delicious sauce and a fresh warm pita sided by fresh fries. The space is a little tight and usually crowded but it feels more like a family gathering for a meal than a crowded restaurant. Plus who can resist handsome men  cooking!!"}
{"text":"Came for a salad and the service was fast I took my salad back to work and the lettuce was wet and wilted. The feta was soggy and d the only things edible was the gyro meat olives and pepperchinis I was disappointed needless to say. Won't be returning but worth a shot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Chicken Gyros was perfect; fresh flat bread, shaved seasoned chicken, and the creamy cucumber sauce make quite a meal. The fries are always crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, and fresh fried. A little pricy, but very worth it."}
{"text":"Food is extremely good...the best gyro around and the chicken salad is great. Prices are a bit too high and the coupons just never seem to be valid if you're lucky enough to find one.  My biggest complaint by far is the employees smoking right outside the entrance. It's pretty nasty to see the cooks smoking a cigarette and walk straight back to cook your food. Yuck."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place, finally gave it a shot today and while the staff was very nice and patient with our questions it wasn't the best food.   When you walk in it's dark, I didn't like that, and there is not enough tzatziki or meat on the sandwiches.   The tzatziki also was not as good as I'm used to.  Usually I can taste the dill but I only tasted vinegar.   Not sure if there is even vinegar in that sauce.  For the best gyros I'll stick with King Gyros on 43 and Tbird.  They're delicious and the tzatziki is the best.   A lot of people seem to really like this place though although there was 3 of us and we all agreed it wasn't very good or meaty.  I'm used to having to take out a lot of the meat and my husband eats it but this barely had a little layer and was full of tomatoes and lettuce."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the #1 combo which is a gyro pita wrap with fries and a drink. Also got the appetizer portion of babaganouj.   The pita was very good and the gyro meat was very flavorful. It was very simple and came with onions, tomato and tzaziki sauce.   The babaganouj was good but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"On out way to Grand Canyon we stopped by to try their food and we were not disappointed. The food is great and the staff are very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the staff are always friendly and the food is delicious. The #10 is my favourite! I would suggest it to anyone looking for some good Greek food that has quick service"}
{"text":"Another great dining experience provided by the recommendations on yelp! The Greek Chicken Salad was excellent. My husband had the Steak Kabob Sandwich and had no complaints; he even noted they do carry so we can come back at a later time."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. The ladies in the front are always so nice, and the chefs in the back are cool too. Food is consistently good, and fast."}
{"text":"Food on both trips was good and freshly made.  Counter service was warm.  They delivered our food table side...rather than the ole' number 16 is ready as they throw it on the counter for you to walk up and fetch.  Portions were good and the food was fantastic.  Price is a bit higher than nearby competitors but worth the difference  UPDATE: This place is now closed :("}
{"text":"Fast food Greek. Pretty good considering. I had the felafel plate which was huge. Small side Greek salad, 6 felafel balls, lots of rice, and pita bread. Enough for two meals. Tahini sauce was good. Salad dressing could be better."}
{"text":"The dressing here in my personal opinion was terrible. After speaking to the cashier her reply was \"What's wrong with the dressing? !\" Yelling at us.  Then said \"The food was already made. I'm not refunding you. \"   Horrible customer service.   Don't ever go here."}
{"text":"Always a hit. The gyros are so, SO good. The staff is so friendly, and the service is quick. I honestly can't imagine why anyone would award less than five starts to The Greek Pita. The price is right and the food is delicious, every single time!"}
{"text":"Great food, good people. The Greek salad is da bomb. Just saying."}
{"text":"I got the falafel pita with fries it wasn't good very dry and mediocre. The fries weren't that good either. It made my stomach hurt , definitely wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Not even one star. This PLACE IS A RIP OFF. I do not recommend this place. There are better establishments that serve Gyros, around this area. Their gyros have more onions than anything else, they skimp out on the meat, seasoning & sauce. The naan bread/ pita is stale, they give small portions, compared to other like establishments, & the meal is not fresh. Not worth the price. In addition, I ordered 2 of the #1 Gyro Value Meals $8.95 and asked if I can pay the difference to switch one to Greek Fries & the other for Onion Rings- side order of Fries ($3.50), Greek Fries ($4.25), Onion Rings ($3.95). As you can see on my receipt (picture posted) she (Nadia) charged me an extra  $2 for Greek Fries & $1.25 for Onion Rings. I asked why I couldn't just pay the difference between the fries ($3.50) & the Greek Fries ($4.25), also, Onion Rings ($3.95) which would be [Greek Fries ($0.75), also, Onion Rings ($0.45)]. I should have just purchased them as separately, as add ons, since they practically charged me half their original price in addition to pay full price for the value meal. It's the principle that matters. I should have asked for a refund and walked away. They take a long time to make their food (they're SLOW compared to other Mediterranean/ Gyro eateries that are tastier)"}
{"text":"I usually don't write negative reviews. But I tried this place again and with some of my chicken being rubbery (again) and their inflexibility (again) to substitute out rice that I don't eat I just don't see this as even an average Greek place."}
{"text":"Nice little Greek spot in North Phoenix. The gyros were packed with meat and sauce. The french fries were pretty good. We ordered Dolmas as an appetizer and they were just okay - kind of bland. The gyro meat salad was pretty good."}
{"text":"Uggggg----this place is so yummy, but they cannot get a carryout order right to save their lives! Every time I order from Greek Pita, my order is incorrect. I repeat the order, have them repeat it back, check the bag. It is still always wrong. I keep going back because the food is really good. We order out from here about twice a month. They used to forget the sauce. Yesterday, even after the woman on the phone repeated the order back to me twice, they gave us the wrong menu item. Last time they did not give the person picking up the food the drinks that came with the meals. As indicated by my past reviews on other less than par experiences, I will continue to frequent this spot, despite my misgivings. I am truly a glutton for punishment."}
{"text":"This is the nearest Greek restaurant to my apartment and I couldn't be happier with it. My girlfriend (One Review Stephanie) and I often get take out from here when looking to satisfy our gyro cravings. I also recommend the falafel.  It is $2.50 for a side order of four, but they'll even do a half order for only $1.25. Good deal. The serving sizes are very big and the gyros are stuffed to the max with meat. I've tried many of the dishes there and have never been disappointed. It is definitely our go-to place for Greek eats! The Greek Pita also offers many American options as well."}
{"text":"Love Greek Pita. We rarely go a week without getting take out. Highly recommend their steak kabab plate. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to get gyros. I have been coming here since 2013. My family and I love it! We moved to surprise 3 years ago and still drive to Happy Valley just for gyros. They are a little pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Greek Pita.  It's a really cute, exceptionally clean space with an open kitchen.  We tried the gyro sandwich, falafel and baba ganoush and enjoyed everything.  Prices were really, really reasonable.  Can't wait to try some other items! Also the gal working the counter has the coolest eye makeup ever.   That is all.  :)"}
{"text":"I recommend their french fries theyre very crispy. I think they double fry them or something. Their gyros are good as well. The place is always clean and well stocked. Service is good. Their pita bread is warm soft n delicious! The meat is tender. I always like what ive ordered from here sandwich or otherwise. Menu could be bigger but Overall great locally owned authentic place for some Greek sandwiches or salad!"}
{"text":"Just plain and simply put, best place on this side of town. Also went to the place up in the north valley and I remember it being damn good too. Worth the visit. Interior is nicely decorated and lit."}
{"text":"Great fast pita / mediterranean / gyro / shawarma place.  Every time I've been the food has been fresh, tasty and terrific.  Friendly staff and clean, comfortable surroundings.  Enjoy before or after your run to Lowe's, Fry's Electronics or Best Buy!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least a half dozen times.   First let me say the food is good, very good.   Portions are large.  Two people can actually share a platter.   Food items I have ordered:  gyro platter, gyro sandwich, chicken kabob platter.  The greek salad that comes with the platters are great.  Filled with fresh veggies and topped with feta and a wonderful greek dressing.   The garlic sauce that comes with the chicken kabob and chicken dishes is better than the tzatziki sauce that comes with the gyro.  I usually get the fries that come with the platter rather than the rice.  I didn't care for the rice, but that is just my preference.   Now you may ask, \"why only three stars.\"    Well the reason for this is the unfriendly rude greek lady at the counter that takes the orders.  I usually get ice water with my meal and my husband normally gets iced tea.   He stopped ordering a beverage when he realized the iced tea they serve is the premade tea with the artificial nasty flavors.  No brewed tea.  We now only order ice water.   Everytime we go in she gets mad when we don't order a beverage and only request ice water to drink.  Her attitude is always snippy and curt.  They never are friendly at the greeting or wish you \"good bye\" when leaving.      The food is good.   Just \"heaven forbid\" don't order just ice water with your meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. I try to bring my own lunch to work, but sometimes (okay, actually quite frequently), I either forget to bring it or get bored with my meals that I end up coming here. My favorites are the chicken  plates and the salads. The meats are always perfectly cooked, the service is fast, and whoever is at the counter is always pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the food here. My favorite meal is the chicken pita. Recommend to anyone looking for good middle-eastern food."}
{"text":"Food - 5 Service - 4 Value - 5  These portions are massive and tasty -- we got the gyros with a side of hummus and the steak schwarma plate.  Both were moist and tender and filled us up for dinner after a lighter lunch earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff who seem to take pride in the restaurant, good prices, good food."}
{"text":"Food is great-service is great-prices are great...what more could you want.  The place is kind of small and packed if you get there after noon.  Guess it wouldn't be busy every day if it sucked though?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to eat here 3-4 times a month. The food is consistently great, they always get our order right. I usually get a salad and add chicken to it. They give you a lot more chicken than most other restaurants for the price. My boyfriend loves the chicken gyro sandwich. Also, best baklava we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great little Greek restaurant. My brother and his wife go here all the time and introduced us to it while we were in town. Meats were really good. I tried the three item combo and it was all tender and delicious. They have a really good pink sauce that tastes great, but we're not sure what it actually is.  Prices are reasonable and it is clean and quiet. It is a busy shopping center and parking can be crowded.  I'm sure we'll be back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Real good food here. I tired their chicken shawarma wrap and loved it. They seem to get super busy during lunch hours. Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the friendly greeting when I ordered my gyros sandwich, fries and drink. The cashier girl ( very cute by the way) also brought my food out as soon as it was ready. I was very happy with the food and service. I will order the salad instead of fries next time, just to eat healthier. The music was kinda weird, but I guess that a greek thing. I will eat here more often."}
{"text":"Feel I'm being generous with three stars, It wasn't terrible, just mediocre...more like two and a half stars.  The place was nice, clean, very friendly and welcoming customer service. They also had a very nice salad. The photos of everything on the menu looked amazing, however, I found what we ordered to be on the greasy side.  The gyros were very plain...the sauce was good but hardly there, which made it dry... the wrap was very greasy and dense, hardly any onions or tomato.....I may be picky based on the other reviews here.  Since moving to AZ, have yet to find a good gyro like back in NY.   I try places on a whim when I see them, hoping I'll find something good, this place doesn't even come close.  Still searching....."}
{"text":"I work nearby and visit the Greek Pita for take out lunch.  The gyro is DELICIOUS, the service is always very fast and friendly. The woman working the counter is always so sweet.   The amount of meat on the gyro is great and it is very flavorful and tender. Definitely recommend for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Small - family owned - FRIENDLY! All the food is from their special unique recipes... including their baklava! A must have if you've never been before. FOOD IS AMAZING! Gotta go. Just go. Do it - you'll be happy you did. Promise."}
{"text":"This place is straight up good ! Never woulda thought so being in a strip mall next to bunch of fast food joints ... Menu has pictures , all looks good ! We had the chicken kabab gyro and regular gyro and SO good and huge portions ! We coulda shared , really good and flavorful . Chicken was fresh , not dry , and just melts in your mouth.. Taziki sauce ..mmmmm mmmm good ! If your in the area and can't decide what to eat , give this place a try .. We did and so glad we did !"}
{"text":"The shop itself is fantastic looking and very well kept.  The food on the other hand is average at best.  The gyro meat was overcooked, the tzatziki sauce was sort of bland and the fries were nothing special.   Judging by the amount of to go orders I assume their other menu options are better than the Gyro.   I personally wouldn't come back for a Gyro with all the options close by but give them a shot if you craving something Greek.  Having said that I tried their Chicken kabob pita and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"This food was so amazing and authentic!!! Personnel was friendly... chicken shawarma with garlic sauce was amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister brought me here and it was bomb! Got a whole meal for around $8 with a huge delicious gryo  with amazing sauce. Friendly staff a plus! Definitely will be back it's right in my area!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros and fries (we haven't tried anything else yet). The gyro was delicious, my Navy husband said he hasn't had a gyro this good since he was in Greece!  The fries, which I normally don't care about, were possibly the best I've ever had - they were crispy and seasoned on the outside, and soft and creamy inside. Plus they're cooked to order, so they come out piping hot.  The staff was friendly, service was quick, and the restaurant was kept very clean, also the prices are quite reasonable. The signage can be hard to see, it's located in the Best Buy shopping center. Since recently moving to Phoenix from Chicagoland, this is definitely in my top 5 favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and the food was pretty good! The kefta kabob plate was a little dry but the rice and side salad was good. They have a pink tzatziki sauce that comes with it... they should bottle it and sell it on stores! We had to wait about 15 minutes which is a little longer than most to-go spots in the area but they were busy so I'll give them that! Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Never disappointing.  Anything you order is delicious, I've tried everything on the menu, with the exception of the hamburger and the hot dog.  Favorite dish is the chicken shwarma.  Sandwich or plate.  DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Average at best. We wanted to stop somewhere quick, but something better than fast food. The girl at the register was very nice. We ordered a gyro plate with rice and a side greek salad, chicken shwarma wrap and a side of hummus. I was expecting more from the hummus, very plain, but the wrap was good."}
{"text":"You usually KNOW what you like immediately & why the moment the plate arrives ...Big LOVE for this place."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Prices were very good, and the service was fast!"}
{"text":"I've gone to atleast 8 other places if I'm not close to this place and literally am disappointed every single time!!!  I not only crave a gyro I crave \"the Greek pita\" YOU HAVE TO GET THE GARLIC SAUCE DROOL SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Nice selection of foods, friendly service, clean restaurant, good value with decent portions.  As a bonus, it's always a plus hearing the proprietors speaking the language of the food they're preparing.  We'll be back when in the Happy Valley area."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This gem is located all tucked away in the back of a strip mall, but holy crap this place is awesome! I tried almost everything but my favorite thing to order is the falafel. One... Because it's like eating a deep fried delicious hummus ball (anything deep fried is better anyway) AND because it's so fun to say. Say it with me now fa-la-fel. But really, their gyro sauce... Deliciousness. I try and go at as often as possible. Only problem is, my eyes are always bigger then my stomach. Please also order the hummus. It's warm and so so SO good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I get the steak kabob plate and the steak is always tender and the rice is delicious, by far my favorite Greek restaurant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food (garlic sauce omg!). I go here often, at least a couple times a month for last 6 or so years. Have never been disappointed. Menu item prices are very reasonable with lunch specials averaging around $7-8 dollars. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is stupid good. I've been going to this location for about 4 years and the best part about it, is that it's consistently good. Never had a bad experience and the cooks have pretty much stayed the same over the years. I get the #3, which is big chunks of steak in a peta bread with onions tomato and lettuce topped with their garlic sauce, which is heaven. Def recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Picked up 2 gyros to go, the price is good, tastes great...kinda light on the sauce, but that seems to be the way it is..."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I go twice a week. The food is authentic, fantastic and prepared by the owners, a nice greek family. Casual dining, order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Clean, modern decor. Great prices. Everything from the hummus to the spanakopita and baklava is delicious. May I recommend the veggie pita? You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great when you want good food on the go! Love their Greek salad pita with chicken. Two meals under $20 is a bargain these days so I give it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! A little on the pricey side in my opinion, but everything I get here is ALWAYS delicious. Since the inside is really cramped, there is almost always people waiting outside to order, which I don't particularly like, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Emily, Nadia and the guys are unbelievable culinary and customer happiness geniuses in a sea of blah and ugh! This is my third visit here and my first visit ever having Greek food. Emily introduced me to everything on the menu with a upbeat personality that you cannot find anywhere these days. The food was exceptional I had the Gyro with their mind numbingly delicious French fries. Possibly the best french fries I've ever tasted, no joke. On my second visit I tried their steak kebab which was suggested by the fabulous Nadia. Another homerun! The meat here is beyond tender, delicious and fresh. My third visit I tried the Gyro #1 again and I am so glad I made the trip back here. Emily actually remembered my nephew and I and of course the guys in the back greeted us with a hearty hello. Place is clean, very reasonable for the amount of food you get and always keeps you hankering for the next visit. Try the Greek pita you will be incredibly pleased!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago for the first time for lunchtime and was blown away.  My god, the food here is delicious.   I got the beef gyro combo and the mass amount of food was huge.  You could easily split it with two people!  If you  havent been here, you gotta stop and eat here.  Great food and great staff!"}
{"text":"JUST visited the Greek Pita a week ago, after driving past it for the past year and a half.  It was pretty worth it!  The bf and I have to give it a 3 1/2 stars... 3 from the BF and 4 from me (so it's a 4 on Yelp ;)  We each had the falafel pita with french fries. The bf said the falafel was too dry for him, but I found it pretty decent. My only complaint was that there was too much tahini sauce in my falafel, yet not enough in the bf's... we probably should have traded!  Other than that, I thought the pita was absolutely delicious. The fries were so-so, don't think I will order them in the future.  That said, the ambiance of The Greek Pita is really cool-it's well decorated and nicely set up. Lots of seating, lots of booths to make it semi-private. It's also really cool to see them shaving the gyro meat right in the kitchen! I mean, I'm not a meat eater, but the bf thought it was cool, so you know... if you're into that...  It's fairly well priced-- about $8 falafel and fries plate. Bf thought it was a little expensive for the quality, but I would imagine that's about average.  We will definitely be going again-- next on our list is the gyro for him, and the hummus platter for me!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a long drive between Phoenix and northern AZ.  I had the best gyro salad since the little Greek restaurant near where I grew up.  The ingredients were fresh, portion was more than generous, and the flavor was amazing.  I'd gladly stop there every time I go through the city.   The atmosphere was very much a family business; the staff was friendly and courteous.  I was just finishing up a really long day trip and the meal almost made it worth it.  I enjoyed it so much I made it a point to come here to Yelp and say so."}
{"text":"Place was great again. Ordered the steak shawarma wirh fries and a drink for $9.50.  Good value and food for the price. Not a large place so get there early. Place is always clean and the restrooms are clean. Thx"}
{"text":"Had a taste for a gyro so decided to give this place a try during my trip to Phoenix. I ordered to go, to bring back to my hotel. I ordered the gyro plate, which comes with a Greek side salad and pita. The meal was just ok. The gyro meat, though plenty, had good flavor but was very dry. The rice was decent, didn't care too much for the vinaigrette dressing for the salad and the tatziki sauce was a little bland. However, the meal was very filling. Definitely had better tasting gyro plates though."}
{"text":"Was out shopping for a television set over at Best Buy West Phoenix thunderbird area. Driving into the Best Buy parking lot I noticed this Greek pita sign after I completed my transaction at Best Buy I pulled up to the Greek pita and order a #8 steak Shawrma.   WOW!!! Big-time flavor!!  Not much of a Greek Pita eater however I'm so glad I decided to backtrack and stop.   The staff was friendly Karen and the gentleman that took my order I don't remember his name super nice people   great price   highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food is great but as many said in the reviews the cashier lady has terrible attitude. She treats you like you are asking food for free"}
{"text":"I eat here almost once a week (probably 3 times a month) with my coworkers for lunch and it never disappoints. In fact our running joke is that one of us will always say \"that was so good\" when we're in the way back to work.   The #9 (chicken shawarma) is hands down the best imo. The #1 (the gyro) and any of the hummus dishes are also excellent.  The price is reasonable with the amount of food you get and the fries are surprisingly good.   As someone else already mentioned, it's a hidden gem in the valley. Don't hesitate to check it out!"}
{"text":"First time! I frequent this area so I remembered it when I had a craving for a Greek salad.  I ordered a Greek chicken salad to go.  The restaurant was clean and the employees were pleasant.  I will definitely be back since the the salad was delicious.  I am interested in trying some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love this place for a lunch stop.  The food is always fresh, as it is made to order, and very flavorful.  My favorite is the #10 - chicken Kebab pita - I get it Greek style which means an addition of tatziki and feta.  The chicken is all white meat, which is a something I am huge stickler about.  The hummus and gyro are also very good.  A lunch will run you about $9-$10."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the majority of the menu, in all the times I've been here, I've always managed to order the same plate. Gyro pita combo. It's awesome, every time. This has to be my favorite stand by."}
{"text":"One of the best Gyros I have found in Phoenix, so many places try too hard.  This place sticks to the basics, fresh shaved cone meat, fried up as with the pita and a soliud sauce.  There was a lot here and definately did not leave wanting more.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"A bustling spot for lunch but thankfully service moves fast and prices are fair.  I liked their garlic sauce, which was pink in color but don't let that scare you off... It's quite tasty as is the pita.   Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with their Greek/Mediterranean salad. Lacked flavor and the tanginess of such salads. It was very unfortunate...  Hubby got the chicken shawarma, which was good and filling in size.   Others around us got French fries as sides which appeared to be very crispy and delicious. No one seemed to be complaining or unhappy about their meals. I'll have to give it another try. I have to get some of those fries!"}
{"text":"I like Greek Pita! I had the chicken schwarma with french fries and the combination was delicious. The chicken was super flavorful and plentiful and it kept falling out of the pita! In fact, the pita was so stuffed that it kind of got messy to eat with sauce, veggies and chicken falling out everywhere. It came with a huge mountain of fries which were tasty, but a bit on the greasier and saltier side. My biggest quip with this place was that my co-worker and I both ordered pitas with french fries and requested water cups, but they charged us the full combination price. Um what? I didn't check if the sandwich and fries prices were individually, so the combo price very well may have been cheaper, but if you're going to charge me for a soda, I think I should at least get my soda right? =/  Overall a tasty place to go. The restaurant itself is TINY and it gets SUPER busy during lunch hours. If you're not lucky enough to swipe a table inside, there are tables available outside on the patio. However, if you're waiting for your food to-go, there is not any place you can wait if it's super crowded. I will be back though! The chicken schwarma was TASTY!"}
{"text":"The family that runs this is super nice and clearly want all their guests to be happy!  The food is very consistent and they do their best to get the food out fast at lunch time."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  The ratio of portion to price is superb, and the selections are vast.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of ingredients.  I'm giving The Greek Pita 5 stars for these reasons, and also because of the cry-baby reviewer who gave this place one star over a 50cents sauce.  Hopefully this will balance the overall rating a bit higher after her unnecessary emotional outburst and 1-star rating. :)"}
{"text":"The falafel here is incredible. Service is good, prices are reasonable. Put this on your list if you like Greek, and you won't be disappointed. Be prepared for a lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Really great little unassuming place located off Thunderbird.  I've eaten here a few times now and it's really good food.  Plenty of menu options, clean, with booths that are big and comfy.    I get my usual when I come here, which is a Gyro, fries (sometimes) and a drink. It's always tasty and made just right.  They could put some more of the white sauce on it, but overall it tastes fresh and delicious.  They also have a few desserts, but I usually never get any because I'm so full when I leave.  I really enjoy eating here from time to time, probably one of the better places to get a good Gyro in town."}
{"text":"This place smells so good.  I ordered the Falafel Salad.  It is just how I like it.  Perfect little balls.  Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and hot.  The vegetables are fresh, perfectly dressed.  It comes with a warm pita and some kind of delectable sauce on the side.  Perfect for dipping the falafel.  Did I say perfect enough?  The place is full and it's barely lunch time. Now a line just started.  I guess I picked the right place."}
{"text":"This place is right by my job and I haven't had a good gyros since I was in Chicago last year. I figured why not? The staff was friendly (and possibly Greek?) and the store was small and clean. I ordered a #1, which was a gyros sandwich, fries and a drink for $8.95, which isn't a bad deal.   The gyros and fries were both good. I grew up eating gyros at Greek restaurants in the Chicago area, so I don't give out 4 or 5 stars for restaurants that serve gyros unless it is really good. My problem with this gyros sandwich was the green tomato pieces, very small amount of tzatziki sauce and not a lot of gyros meat. The flavor of the meat and the freshness of the pita were good. If the person preparing the sandwich cared enough to give me tomatoes that weren't rotting and a little more meat, this would have been a four star rating.  But he didn't care, so I will keep searching for my \"go to\" spot in the Valley for a great gyros sandwich."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but falafel has too much cumin and is bitter. Everything else is great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!  I go there twice a week at least.  I switch from Chicken Gyro Greek salad and the Steak Schwarma Greek salad, though I do love their lamb and chicken gyros too!. Can't find hummus that tastes like this! It is absolutely wonderful!  I love greek food and have tried so many different places and this place is the BEST!!  Their falafel is fantastic!  So are their pitas, soft and fresh every time. Try their greek fries, yummy! Also, the garlic sauce rules! The staff is wonderful and I just love the cashier!  She knows my name and knows exactly what I order when I walk in or even call.  Price is comparable to every other greek place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! One of my favorite spots in north Phoenix to grub for a very reasonable price. My personal favorite is the grilled chicken pita #10 with the garlic sauce and fries. Hands down the tastiest pita in the area. The baklava is also delicious if you have a sweet tooth! Their customer service is always great, the woman who works in the day time (I feel so bad I forgot her name) is super kind, and extremely helpful if your not familiar with something on the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good Greek food and fair prices. LOVE their three meat combo meal - the steak is really good and is marinated in 'something' that gives it an excellent flavor, the ground beef kebab is seasoned and tasty & the doner meat is amongst the best in the valley...."}
{"text":"Really great falafel. Staff is courteous, and you get a lot of food for a reasonable price. The portions are big enough to be shared. I recommend the #2 and the falafel plate. If you're feeling particularly glutinous, order the Greek fries. Excellent rice."}
{"text":"Love this place. They are always so welcoming and the food is fresh!  I visit here maybe 1 or 2 times a month since I work in the area and their gyro salad is the best!  I've never been disappointed. One time I decided to try the chicken salad instead and that was also delicious. What ever the pink sauce is that comes with that salad is to die for!  I will order that with my gyro salad!  The meat is so full of flavor. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very good food for the value.... I gave it four stars because I have only had one item there so I haven't tried the majority of the menu.  I had the #1 Gyro combo meal and it was delicious.  I got it \"to go\" and was pleasantly surprised that they don't start the sandwich or drop the fries until it is actually ordered which means hot crispy fries and juicy meat which is a must for me.  The place is very small but I do not think they are going for a large operation.  Staff is very friendly and will ask questions about certain ingredients to make sure you get what you want in the item i.e. onions, tomatoes, etc.  The kitchen staff is also friendly and clean since it is an \"open\" kitchen concept and they will deliver the food to tables if the cashier is busy instead of making the guest get up... Overall good food, value and a great option for a quick dinner when you do not feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, highly recommended by most of the reviews. Ordered the Kefta dish, got to work, started eating it and it was delish. The meat was a bit dry for my liking, but tasty. Then, I went to eat the rice and I look closer and there's a piece of black hair right by the tomato!!!! As good as this place was, I will never go back because of the lack of hygiene. Hair nets would be suitable. I'll be calling them in my break to complain and let them know."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of salads you should stop by The Greek Pita. I absolutely recommend their chicken salad. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Simply the best gyros, best Greek grilled chicken salad and most generous portions in the valley Humus is off the chain!"}
{"text":"Best Greek and Mediterranean food I have found in Arizona so far.  Sis and her hubs love this place, so we had to try it before leaving.  Falafel is fresh and real!  Prices are very reasonable.  My only bad note would be the garlic sauce. It's not garlic sauce.  It might be garlicy pink runny tarter sauce.  It's not true garlic sauce I was craving it.  But oh well.  the sandwiches, and falafel was excellent.  The staff was so friendly and I commiserated with the counter gal over our purple hair highlights.  It looked like they were really busy too. Thankfully we caught the end of the rush and could get a seat.   I see why they are so popular. Really great place."}
{"text":"I stopped by because I was out shopping and didn't feel like eating Carl's jr. . The parking lot was packed, there were people standing outside the restaurant, and all but two tables were full when I arrived. I waited in line behind one person, and ordered my food. I got the number one, which is a gyro with fries and drink for $8.95. I was in and out of there in less than 5 minutes with hot fresh food. The gyro was delicious, and the meat was falling out of it there was so much of it. Their fries are a little different and really awesome. I was really surprised at the speed of service. The girl behind the counter was nice, the guy who presented my food was nice, everybody was super polite and helpful. The restaurant was clean. Really, no complaints. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bad service and rude employee. She made mistakes with our order and made us feel unwelcome. Like it was an inconvenience to fix the order and refund the overage. Anyone have a good falafel place for the north valley?"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant and finally got the opportunity the other day. I ordered the Falafel Pita. The falafel and the pita itself were rather good, however the rest of the pita sandwich was disappointing. Apparently you have to pay extra for Tzatziki which should be a part of the sandwich. The vegetables in the sandwich were rather sparse. I found a small amount of lettuce and tomatoes. No cucumber. Considering I paid almost 10$ for  the meal (including t ax, of course),  I was rather disappointed. I will not use this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great hummus.  I judge by he hummus and I am satisfied.  My wife had the Greek salad. Loved it.  We weren't crazy about the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"OMG it's a first time in this place the pips really nice the food fresh and tasty and affordable definitely recommend to every single person who's around this area amazing food I think I want to get another one"}
{"text":"Good, quick place to eat in Happy Valley. I ordered the chicken kabob plate. Overall, the meal was good."}
{"text":"Try the \"Chicken Gyros\" if regular Gyros aren't your thing. Either way, these are the best Gyros in North Phoenix. The place is clean and well decorated, the staff is friendly, just like it should be."}
{"text":"Nope. Not impressed. The Greek dressing for the salad was weak. The tzatziki was runny and the gyro meat was standard. I have been desperately seeking a new Mediterranean place since Rotana closed. Unfortunately my search continues."}
{"text":"The Greek Pita is a well hidden secret in N. Phoenix. The 'strip mall' setting may not appeal to all - but it's not your typical place in a mall.   From the moment Nadia - the Owner - greets you at the desk, you smell the roasting meats, the sauces and the authenticity throughout.   We love the Gyros, and recently tried the Falafel - which was so tasty and well cooked - not your tiny little balls of mush - crispy outside and warm and toasty inside with all of the flavors you want!   We are kind of picky eaters - and whenever we add this - minus that - or request anything - the cooks get it right!  The portions are good sized and fairly priced. SO worth the trip to the North side! My Husband Jack & I take friends there & no one is ever disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place & have eaten here for 4 years! Best chicken Greek salad in Phoenix. High quality meat if you eat it. Excellent hummus & baba ghanouij and a pink garlic sauce that you will crave!  Servings are large, feta is fresh if you like cheese & they have the good thick pita's. They cater to your order & the cooks greet you with a smile... At least they do me because I'm in all the time!  Hidden in a strip mall behind Best Buy on the west side it's not easy to discover. They have opened a second location in Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in two weeks. Gyros are delicious and service is great! Everyone is friendly with a smile. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I decided to get some gyros here last night for dinner since no one wanted to cook after a long hot day of work.  My wife and I both ordered the gyro combo and our daughter had a corn dog meal to go. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. None of us could finish the fries though just because there were so many of them. It's a shame because they are really good especially with a ketchup/sriracha sauce on them.  I have to say, this is the best Greek food I've found in Arizona so far. It is extremely good and very reasonably priced.  My wife drew my attention to the Greek fries after I had placed our order. I think next time I will have to try those and she wants to try a falafel.   It is certain that we will be returning customers."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Greek Pita, the Gyros are freshly sliced off of a split as you order. This isn't your crappy coney island microwaved Gyro!! I didn't expect great Greek food in the middle of a desert but don't take my word for it!"}
{"text":"Okay so the food is amazing right off the bat also the servers are amazing Emily and her mom in particular make this place a 6 star!!!"}
{"text":"I just had this place for lunch. My boyfriend had the #1 and it was loaded with tons of meat. I had the number #10 and again the size was perfect. The fries were not over favorite but they were fresh. All of the food was fresh. There was plenty of seats inside but it wasn't to big. The staff was friendly. There was plenty of soda choices. The condiment section was clean and had a good selection of choices. Over all the food was good the service was awesome and the place was supper clean. Great choice if you are in the mood for Greek."}
{"text":"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita.    I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions.  The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings.  The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce  has a nice tang to it.  It tasted light, cool, and creamy.   The total cost was $5.74 + tax.  I left with a very happy belly."}
{"text":"Just a fantastic Gyro. Very unassuming place, but the Gyro was great and the fries were pretty much perfectly done. Just the right amount of crisp on the outside and the right amount of gooey softness on the inside. I wish it was closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Steak Shawarma - pretty tasty, and great if your in the area.. This location is VERY clean, which isnt normal for most mediteranian places,, just saying, :p   Will be back but not an out of the way food trip,,"}
{"text":"Why did it take us so long to find this place? Just moving to this area I go to Walmart all the time but have never stopped in. My husband and I are big fans of Gyros but a little picky cause we're so use to Gyros from Chicago and Gyros here are a little different.  But we have found our new \"go to\" !! The gyro meat was very delicious and really flavorful. And we enjoyed the fires also. Gyros can be very greasy and I hate when my pita is full of grease..this gyro was prefect no big greasy mess. We will definitely be back once a week now! If you haven't stopped in you really should! I can't speak on other locations but this one was very cute and clean and the stuff was friendly and helpful.  Its always an extra plus for me to have my food made hot and fresh.. But I don't mind the wait ..it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Think I'm a quarterly regular, love the Chicken Kebab platter. Service is always friendly and speedy. The rice was soft and fresh, chicken a little over cooked.. will go back in 3 more months, busy lunch spot parking usually tricky"}
{"text":"My favorite for quick Greek food.  Better than My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.  No beer though.  I love that is is easy to walk fromt the VA.   I have only had the salads so far and have been impressed."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a quick meal. The chicken kabob plate is fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since they open I later moved to Scottsdale and still make the drive to come eat here because every other Greek place I've tried doesn't compare to this place . The food is always wonderful and the lady running the place is so kind."}
{"text":"o...m...g  amazing!!!  I tend to stick to their beef items but everything I have had is amazing.  It's a garlic lovers paradise with their garlic rice and Tzatziki sauce and their portions are HUGE.  My only gripe is their fries since I am not a thick steak fry person but I just get their plate meal that comes with entrée, small greek salad, garlic rice and a pita with a side of Tzatziki sauce.  The dining area is small and the place can fill up quickly during lunch but totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Chicken gyro was pretty good but the garlic sauce atop made the amazing! Side Greek salad had the freshest and most abundant feta cheese I've ever tasted -- delicious quick lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! I probably eat here at least once a week. Everyone is always so friendly!! The shawarma plate is delicious and worth every penny! Do not skip the pink garlic sauce! That stuff is addicting!!! We used to frequent the Tempe location, sooooo glad they have one by our new home!!!"}
{"text":"This place  was \"okay.\"  We tried to use a coupon, but they didn't accept it.  Right off that's kind of annoying.  The pita and the fries weren't bad, but not spectactular either from what I remember.  It's a tiny little place in a strip mall.  Nothing to write home about but a decent pita if you need something close by."}
{"text":"My Son and Daughter in Law (DIL) come here frequently and it's close to their work.  My wife and I love Greek food and thought this is worth trying. We wanted something different then your normal, burgers, subs, pizza for Lunch.  This Greek Pita place is close to Thunderbird Rd and interstate 17. Sort of on the South West side of the two major cross streets.  It's east of 30th ave.  We went on Wed afternoon about 1:45pm. The place wasn't crowded, probably just missed the lunch crowd, they had a steady stream of people coming in. At any given time around 5 to 7 groups or people came in ordered or stayed and ate their meals.  I liked the fact if you stayed, they brought your food to your table. The layout is very similar to a fast food burger or sub joint. our order came out in about 10 minutes. Our DIL said sometimes they are fast, other times it can be really slow depending on the # of people in the joint. It's nice they have high chairs since our 9 month old grandson was with us.  What we ordered:  3 sodas with unlimited refills, no charge for refills 1 Appetizer combo (Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, dolmas (3), falafel & 2 pitabread 1 #1 Gyro combo, I substituted onion rings for fries and there was a $1.25 extra charge 1  Gyro pita which meant no fries or drink 1 #11 Chicken gyro- no sauce 1 Dolmas.  Total bill for 4 adults including tax was $40 on the spot.  Was a bit more expense than a Micky D's combo or Burger King combo which probably would have been about $20 to $25.  My wife liked the appetizer platter and loved the warmed pita bread.  I thought the falafel on the appetizer was overcooked, the dolmas is served cold, I like dolmas warm to hot. couldn't really differentiate the taste of hummus vs baba ghanouj, but I don't eat enough of it to really say.  My Gyro tasted good, they gave enough Tsatziki sauce to my satisfaction.  Over all the food was average to good, we all enjoyed it, I would come back for quick Greek Food on the fly."}
{"text":"It is not often that you get all three right - quality in food, service and atmosphere anf the fourth thing: price!  Oh - here is another thing - cleanliness! I would give this place more stars if it were possible.  The gyro sandwich is large enough to share w another person. Their greek salad is just perfect. It is no wonder that there is often no place to sit!  I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Yelp strikes again. I knew I needed to stop here to hit up Fry's (reviewed elsewhere) but I wanted a nice sit-down meal. Not fast food, not a chain and not expensive. And so Yelp pointed me here.  I went with the gyro platter, which arrived with a large pile of sliced lamb, excellent rice (soft, not crunchy), a toasted pita, a pot of tzatziki sauce and a large greek salad. I ate ALL of it. So yummy.  Comfortable store front restaurant. No free wifi, but my hands were full with fork and torn pieces of pita. I'm assuming the music that was piped in was Greek, but I don't know.  Some strange anomalies on the menu. Sure, gyros and kefta and felafel. But why are there burgers, hot dogs and fish & chips??"}
{"text":"Dry rice dry chicken Kabob dinner almost inedible. Cat loved it."}
{"text":"As good if not better than my favorite Greek Pita ( on happy valley) that has always been the best Chicken Kabob I've had in Phx"}
{"text":"Very good Gyro sandwhich.  Meat very flavorful and not overcooked.  Pita fresh.  Great french fries..super crispy on outside and hot and soft inside really good.  8.95 for a combo with drink.  Great deal and alot of food!   This is my second visit will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Love their gyro salad - big and yummy! Definitely recommend this place if you want greek on the go - travels well!"}
{"text":"Affordable,  yummy  and great customer service .the portions are great,  very tasty and filling. Hands down BEST GYRO IN ARIZONA"}
{"text":"The Greek Pita is my choice for kebab when I don't have the time for The Olive Tree Mediterranean Market (it's more fast food oriented).  To date I've only ordered the Kefta kebab, plate and sandwich, and the fish and chips.  All have been very good, but my recommendation would be the Kefta sandwich.  Be sure to ask for the Greek hot sauce, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Falafel was like eating sand.  Yes, real sand.  The outside was overly crispy and it reminded me of beach experiences when sand got in my mouth.  Falafel plate comes with rice, salad, and pita.... yet no hummus or anything substantial to dip the pita into.  Tahini?  No, not that whole pita into a little plastic ramekin of tahini.  Dry, dry, dry and no relief to be found.    Please, fellow yelper, stick with the falafel sandwich or other value meal.  No need for dry mouth syndrome at a greek pita place.  Also it's overpriced.  Falafel plate with soda is just under $12.  If you order hummus to remedy the dry mouth issue then you're bumping up to $16-17 for ONE person."}
{"text":"Very good food. Good service. I sat down after I ordered, and one of the employees brought the food to my table, instead of me having to get up to get it. Lots of meat on the gyro, sauce was delicious. I would go back."}
{"text":"My Daughter LOVES this place so much she wants to retunr to Phoenix!  SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Really good gyro... I'll try Italian beef next time. But, the real surprise was the french fries. Best I've ever had. Crisp outside and amazingly tender inside.  I hope it wasnt a fluke. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Simply the best Greek food.  Always fresh always delicious.  The feta fries are amazing.  Also the baklava.  My favorite is the Shawarma with the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week.   Delicious and generous portions, I am actually drooling right now just thinking about it! Friendly workers who keep the place very clean. Prices are very reasonable. We get the hummus plate with steak shawarma and a salad and both feast for around $12"}
{"text":"I found this little gem of a restaurant one day while looking for the best Gyro I could find in Phoenix. Much to my surprise, this IS the best place in Phoenix to get a Gyro.   The staff, more specifically Emily and Nadia, are extremely friendly, the dining experience is extremely clean, and best of all the food is simply incredible. I can not stress enough how great this food is. The fries are out of this world, and the meat in the a gyros is so tender its mind blowing.  I tell everyone I know about this place and they all come back to me and tell me how great this place is. Highly recommended!  Try the food, you won't be disappointed."}
