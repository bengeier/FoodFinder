{"text":"This place has one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Two words: garlic quinoa! You must must must try the garlic quinoa! Also, the French fries here are absolutely incredible. It is seriously dangerous if you live within a five kilometre radius of this establishment. You will get very very corpulent to say the least. Mmm mmm such delicious heart disease. I once went to this place thrice consecutively over the course of two days. That's right I ate here twice in one day. Lunch, dinner and then again for breakfast the next day! With my third order of veggie burger - as I tasted the beautiful French fries I could hear my arteries clogging but screw you ! dear cardiovascular system - it's the taste buds that run the show here. 

There is one small gaping downside to this place and that is that the proprietor and some of the staff have horribly xenophobic attitudes toward the francophone population. They'll scratch their own eyes out before you can get a word of Québec's and Canada's official language out of them. Seriously, how goddamned dumb is that? It makes me want to vote for the Parti Québécois again except this time it's because of a burger joint and not Jean Charest!?! This is Montréal! Speak some French. Tabarnac ! It kind of pisses me off. 

So go to this place soon before it gets shut down (and rightly so) by the Office québécois de la langue française. Hopefully it doesn't have to come to that. Hopefully they change their racist ways in the true spirit of rapprochement. 

I hope I haven't sparked a sovereignty debate over Yelp. 

In any case: 

Vive le Montréal !"}

{"text":"For a while, I made a point of passing by this place and never stopping in. It was just a matter of principle: If I can't trust a restaurant to avoid using Comic Sans on its sign, how am I going to trust them to prepare my food? But when I was wandering for dinner one time in the area, I saw a \"pulled pork combo\" for $6.25 and figured, hey, it's better to knock a place you've tried than one you haven't. The décor on the inside is pretty basic, but a whole lot better than the outside. I liked the cook and the cashier. The pulled pork sandwich came on a pretty big bed of high-quality fries. It ain't Stubb's, but the food was perfectly acceptable, and greatly improved by the addition of hot sauce, of which they had 4 or 5 of my favorite brands.

Burgers Etc., I like you, despite your terrible sign. Seriously, you're in a hip, happenin' 'hood in western Montreal (shoot me now, I can't believe I just said that). You will lose business over it. Not mine, though. You've got a friend in me.

Maybe get some music in there, too. The whirring of the soda machine doesn't do much for the atmosphere."}
