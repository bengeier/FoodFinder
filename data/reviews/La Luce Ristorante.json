{"text":"Excellent, I had to mixed seafood, it was fabulous. Only 1thing about this place, waiter showed us to our tables, did not introduce himself. He only asked what would you like to drink? The whole time we were there he didn't crack a smile. Surroundings are very cold, the people are very cold. I often wondered why every time I drive by there, there never is any cars. We were there on a Friday night 6:00pm, 2  of us, and another table of 3. How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon deal and the location is in a small plaza where all the stores this Monday night except Giorgio D. Location is easy to find and plenty of free parking. The waitress was friendly, helpful and efficient.  My husband and I ordered the same dinner : prosciutto. with melon as an appetizer. The bread arrived first with a mix of French bread and Rosemary Foccaccia with a side of butter, hot peppers in oil, and black olive spread. Everything was fresh and delicious. The New York strip loin was spooked to our liking, very juicy, well seasoned and a generous 10oz portion, served with roasted potatoes, roasted sliced carrots and steamed broccoli. Our son ordered the Fritta mista di mare, lightly breaded and fried mixture of large shrimp, calamari, and cuttlefish. The menu description said scallops too but he didn't get any. The food was so flavourfull, that a missing scallop didn't matter, so we didn't mention it. For dessert, we had chocolate Tartufo ice cream, and you can't go wrong with that. The decaf cappuccino was by far the best cappuccino I have ever had, with the most frothy foam ever! I definately recommend this place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Best Veal Chop ever.  Awesome service.  Great atmosphere. This is not a budget type of place.  This is a special occasion restaurant.  My mouth salivates when I think of the veal chop.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Came here today , everything was so salty even the potatoes,green beans,bread and obviously what ever shows in my pictures  ... Literally forced myself to swallow everyting since it costs $100+..   Service was efficient but never checked on us... On a Tuesday snow storm night.. And smacking the bill down after seeing we finished the dessert  Bread was cold and hard like rock ..   Ordered veal chop.. that ended up giving me an upset stomach feeling like im gonna vomit and there are flies hovering above my food!! Clearly there is something wrong with the food.. Cause I didn't eat anything else within 6hrs before eating here.   Not to mention flickering music/lights caused by the snow storm totally kills the mood  Probably never gonna be back..."}
{"text":"Giorgio D has been in business 35 years! They're doing something right, so I had to check it out.   The d√©cor is modern and classic. The piano that plays itself when you enter is a little creepy, but it created a beautiful atmosphere. We arrived early for our reservation, but they gladly took us in as our table was ready. I immediately felt underdressed. There were people in jeans there, but I still felt like I should've worn something nicer. Awkward.   We ordered drinks and made our picks. Our server did not greet us. I found this strange, yet efficient. He arrived and asked us what we wanted. We ordered, he brought it. They had other wait staff refilling drinks and removing plates, so we didn't see him often. He was polite and said everything on the menu with much more Italian grace than we did. Sometimes, it's less embarrassing to point at your choice than to try to pronounce it.    The food was incredible. I ordered the Veal Tenderloin Marsala and my mother ordered a seafood dish, Frittura Mista Di Mare. The veal was tender and juicy. It was smothered in rich gravy and large slices of mushrooms. My mothers dish had breaded cuttlefish, calamari, scallops and shrimp. The breading was thin, crispy and buttery. They could've breaded the plate and I would've eaten it. The calamari was tender, cuttlefish was light and tasty, shrimp were huge and scallops were cooked to perfection.   Both of our dishes came with the same sides, broccoli and roasted potatoes. The roasted potatoes were lightly seasoned with a little crisp. I've never had broccoli that was cooked so perfectly. It was cooked, but still crunch remained. It was refreshing to have veggies that weren't mushy or barely warm.   Dessert. How could we leave without having dessert?? Tiramisu. The good stuff and it was real. There aren't enough adjectives for me to describe how good this was and at $10 a piece, it better be good!   Great place for a special occasion or date night!"}
{"text":"Now, I rarely come down to this area. In fact, it really may be my first time having a meal around Jane and Steeles, but I ended up here nonetheless.   The restaurant itself seemed a bit pretentious on the outside and inside, but I was here for a date, so I guess it suited the mood. With a grand piano sitting at the front, it felt a lot classier than I initially thought it would be. Oh well! They still sat me with shorts and sandals! #win  Considering it was a Wednesday night, it was still pretty dead inside. Had 2 staff waiting in the area, and only 3 tables seating at any time. Overall, pretty good service (as their wasn't anyone around), but I did have to specifically ask for more water.  Food was decent. Came with bread at the start, with butter, olive paste, and hot pepper sauce. Were interesting accompaniment, but wasn't that good. Bread was a bit cold as well. I originally thought about having steak, but at $32, it seemed a bit too pricey. Ended up with the Penne Alla Vodka, which was quite good. Was creamy without being too heavy, but ended up being a bit one dimensional since it was really just pasta. The other ingredients (porchetta and prosciutto) were no where to be seen. My date got the Chicken, which apparently was quite good.  Overall, a decent evening, but probably not a go-to spot for just a meal. On a date? May want to consider it, but may just go somewhere closer to home for me personally."}
{"text":"Couldn't even get sat at a table. Opened and closed the door 3 times in 10 minutes and still couldn't get a hostess to seat us. No idea what the food is like but they definatley need to step up the service."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very quiet, calm atmosphere. staff is very nice and attentive. The veal chop is my fave! Cooked to perfection. Wait time was a bit long but totally worth it for the delicious food! It's great for a fancy meal because it's quiet, romantic and the decor is although traditional, the perfect setting for a great date. I've been here twice and it's around a 40min drive from my house but it was worth it both times! I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often to indulge."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was horrible.  The waitress didn't check in to see how our appetizers or entrees were. No water or wine refill. It was a Monday night with only three tables in the restaurant to serve.  I had to wave down the waitress. When I told her the grilled calamari still had the membrane on it she said \"that's the way it's supposed to be\"  and avoided our table for the rest of the night.  I will not return not even with an other Groupon."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this jem tonight and was very pleased with excellent food and service. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere in the restaurant. It was not what I was expecting from a restaurant in a small little plaza with a single wooden door. The place felt classy, food was not bad. Overall a good groupon deal! I feel this place is great for both family dinners and romantic dinners. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice ambience. I hadn't had a good pasta in a long time before I came here today."}
