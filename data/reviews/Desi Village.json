{"text":"Pros-Good tasting, Always Fresh. Cons-small portions for what ur paying for, not always open"}
{"text":"Meat Lover thali during lunch time was good and reasonable priced...Fresh Food. Great Service. Will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"This is what I wanted. My Friends and I usually go to Gerrard to have Pakistani Food. Now No need. I had their biryani and it was delicious. Also the butter chicken is divine. Being a university student this works out for me and my friends"}
{"text":"Affordable pricing and good taste. Aimed at capturing the student customer segment. Quantity is good enough too. A roti comes accompanied with most main dishes, leaving no stomach unhappy. They do home delivery for the nearby areas too (min order of $20)  Bottom line: Worth the price tag and good flavour/taste"}
{"text":"I order from this place regularly. Butter chicken is amazing. My favourite item is the Haleem. So good...I eat here regularly as their food is great to bring to work and re-heat."}
{"text":"Very over priced, very small portions, chicken breast was extremely dried out.  I got take out and was shocked when I got home and saw how little chicken was in the container, two or 3 tiny bite size pieces.  Out of curiosity I took the pieces of chicken out and put them on my food scale at home and there was 2.3 oz of chicken for 9.99 + taxes, almost 12.00.  So I paid almost 12.00 for a bowl of rice and a container of sauce.  Having said that I will say the rice was good and the sauce tasted good, but not at 12.00, and 2.3 oz of chicken is not even half a chicken breast, a typical chicken breast weighs approx. 6 oz.  I doubt this place will survive long if they don't change their prices or offer a full serving of protein at the price.  For 12.00 a customer should be receiving a full chicken breast with sauce and rice.  This place is also trying to attract university students, not going to happen at these prices, students want value for their money and this is very over priced, tiny portions of food.  If they used dark meat chicken (which is what should be used in butter chicken) they be able to offer the meal at a cheaper price and the chicken wouldn't be dried out the was the breast meat does, plus customers would then hopefully be able to get a regular serving size.  Too bad, I was hoping they'd succeed here cause we need more affordable food options in the area for the office/business workers and for the university students, but at those prices and those small portions they can't possible get customers to come back.  I would go back if they changed their prices and the portion sizes, but at these rates, definitely will not go back."}
