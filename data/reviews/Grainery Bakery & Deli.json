{"text":"This place is AMAZING! All the food is so fresh and delicious, the make the food out the back which you can see through the Windows! There's a meat counter which is cheaper to get the meat there than most places like Metro etc, (literally halfprice for 300g of meat)..
Well worth the visit and staff are lovely!
We always go and will continue to visit! Don't miss out! Just leave enough for the rest of us ;)"}
{"text":"Great! They have a large selection of very fresh breads, meats and cheeses. You can even have them make you a sandwich. Their deal bread is only 1.50 and incredibly fresh, like so hot that they can't even slice it for you. They have a lot of samples too.

Soups are not served on weekends."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely great with helping me create a catering so I can send to one of my dearest friends during the passing of his father. I wanted trays of multiple items. They were so helpful and attentive. I would suggest a better website because I was calling from Los Angeles and it would have been a tad easier. Thank you guys so much for helping me out in a time that is stressful."}
{"text":"this place is an old BunKing location, but the bread is still the same, I remember going swimming with my friend and his mom, she use to pick up a dozen hamburger bun rolls and the would really hit the spot to recover those carbs burnt from swimming.....good location...better bread"}
{"text":"Custard tarts weren't bad but still not great. They were refrigerated and the crust tasted stale. Sadly disappointed this time. I will give them a second chance however as I did like the taste of the custard, perhaps it's far better when freshly baked."}
