{"text":"The food tasted absolutely awful there was no ranch with my buffalo chicken pizza there was no sour cream with my potato skins it took an hour and a half To be delivered it was by far the worst pizza I have ever had it looked like pizza plus Valeeta cheese plus old KFC minus delicious taste. I will never order from here again and I recommend you do the same unless your ex-girlfriend is coming over and you don't want her to be happy"}
{"text":"Great food! Some of the best homemade sauces around! Linguini alla pollo is fabulous!  And don't fill up too much cause the homemade desserts are always yummo and inventive! One of the best steaks I've ever had was the filet here on the back deck on a warm summer night! I will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Great food and, friendly atmosphere. Love the Sunday brunch. The cheese balls are one of my favorite appetizers. The chicken tenders are the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was good.  Food was above average for a buffet.  We got there early on the advice of other reviews. We were shown to a table beside a party of 40+ sitting in the middle of the dining room spread among two long tables.  The omelet station was out of the question since they were taking orders and handing out numbers.   The noise of so many people talking over each other was deafening.  May try again in the spring when the deck opens back up."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get good American traditional food. I'm obsessed with their Alfredo sauce but my hubby and I both really like the gourmet burger too. App fav are the zucchini and the meatball crostini. My hubs loves all the craft beer including a ton on tap. Pretty impressive for a local suburban bar. I see some bad reviews about the owner and I have never know her to be anything but sweet and offer suggestions on new crafts for hubs to try. So I take what others said with a grain of salt. We've also been to Sunday brunch. It's good, very reasonably priced, wish some
Things got switched out every once in a while. Overall this place hits all high points! Go now before the secret is out!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I ever went here. And unfortunately it will be the last. 

First we did have a big group with some kids. So the deck worked well for us outside. 

There was a reversal wedding dinner inside which took up half the room. The other half was a little league baseball team. Weird mix right...

We had a nice waitress and she did a decent job. But could have gotten us lots more drinks. She just didn't check in with us enough. 

Now the food was just awful. 

Here is each review:

Fried fish sandwich- good breeding but it's the same for all their fried food. The small is a huge portion. No need for the large. Bun size was nice but I only ate the fish. 

They served their cocktail and tarter in the smallest pre portioned containers. No joke I used 16. 8 of each. 

The fried zucchini was good but needed salt. Again huge portion. 

Artichoke Romano was the worst dish I ever ate. Seriously. The batter was raw and so thick. 

Someone got a burger order med temp. It came out rare. We sent it back and they just out the burger in the oven on the same plate. So when it came back out the plate was on fire. And guess what the burger was still rare. How could they just not start over and cook a new one. This is just unthinkable. 

Sorry but will never go back to this place. Too bad because it could have such potential."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 6 times.. typical bar food.  The place itself has much potential and could be a realy nice restaurant but they have to get a real menu and step back from the microwave and drop all the frozen stuff."}
{"text":"We visited today for the first time to try their Sunday Brunch.  It was great!  The food options were really tasty.  I especially liked their breakfast potatoes, and I had a yummy Belgium Waffle with all their toppings. The cost seemed pretty good - it was $8.95/adult for the brunch buffet and there was plenty of food.  It seemed like a nice cozy place and we definitely want to come back to try a regular meal here.  The front part is a bar area, which does seem a little older like some reviewers have said.  The back part was the cozy dining area.  They also have two outside deck areas that people were using."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place but definitely has gone downhill.  The food isn't very good anymore and the service is terrible.   The owner has a bad attitude and because she treats customers so poorly the rear of the service staff do as well."}
{"text":"Natalie the owner works hard to make this place good and she has a great crew to help her! The food is delicious (we had jumbo wings and an amazing fish sandwich) and the prices for everything are very reasonable. Everyone is friendly!"}
{"text":"um, it's not an inn, it's a BAR.  I've eaten here numerous times with my wife and other family members/friends.
First, the good:  the fish sandwich and the desserts (which they have told us are homemade).
Now the rest:
-place is in severe (no, DIRE) need of updating.  Walking through the doors is like walking into a 1970's era bar.  The place for all I know may be cleaned meticulously, but whenever I leave here I always feel \"dirty\".
-the food, other than what I mentioned above, is just \"average\".  nothing outstanding.  I wouldn't make a special trip across town to eat here.  Wow factor?  NONE.

My biggest gripe about Middle Road Inn?  The menu on their website!
The menu on their website, to the best of my knowledge, hasn't been updated in probably a few years (at least).  What I mean by this is that the prices on their menu on the web seem to be from the 1970's as well.  Middle Road Inn, get with it already."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best largest fish sandwich I can ever remember..... awesome accommodating staff.....friendly....great place in an unlikely place out of the way !!!!"}
{"text":"I had previously gone for Father's Day lunch buffet and loved it.  After a long hiatus, we returned for fish during this lent.  Our 2 young sons accompanied us.  We never actually ate because they were charging 3.00 for a CHILD'S soda ( they said free refills, but who gives their 4 y/o more than 1 small glass of soda at dinner... let alone more than the uncapped adult size glass they placed in front of him).  The fish was 11.00 alone (fries were extra), and there was a 3.00 plate charge for my 2 boys to split a meal!.  I am far from cheap, but I refuse to be blatantly \"nickel and dimed\". We left and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time there, needless to say will be the last!  We had nachos the chips are greasy they give you a tiny dressing cup of salsa.  I had the Cobb salad it was served with brown lettuce the avocados where not ripe and hard and turning black, my mom had the pot roast sandwich she only ate half said it had no taste, service was ok our waiter was new got promoted from dishwasher to waiter!"}
{"text":"It's very nice looking place. Can't wait to try the outdoor seating! The food was very good. We had the gourmet burger and steak hoagie."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at MRI.  Best home cooked food period, beside Bellisario's.  This place is GOOD!  I don't care what night it is, get the special and you won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"Overall a solid experience.  Went here because we had Groupon.  The inside is a cozy former hotel.  Food was really good we had buffalo chicken pizza and chicken piccata. Service was excellent. Would come again.  Recommend to Get the Groupon and go there"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Side salad was limp and old and the side of veggies that I ordered with my meal was still frozen. Service was good - but food was so bad."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch!!! Plenty of choices and made to order omelets. Bring the entire family early as this place fills up really fast at 10:00 Sunday."}
{"text":"My family comes here rather frequently for dinner. We are always seated very quickly and the dinning room is spacious and not very loud.

The menu is pretty standard with sandwiches, pizza, wings, Italian food and a few other things here and there. The food is pretty good, although, for me, there are no stand out dishes. The soups can be hit or miss, with some being rather salty. Service is quick."}
{"text":"The Middle Road Inn is your typical suburban bar where you're guaranteed to see the exact same people there every weekend. I don't come here for the bar though although that is a big draw. I come for the food, particularly the Sunday brunch. Come here for the Sunday Brunch and you'll be swept away by the gloriousness that is their Parmesan garlic potatoes. These are so delicious I could eat a whole plate of just potatoes. Beyond the starchy goodness, there's also bacon, scrambled eggs, sausage, fruit, pasta, chicken, made-to-order omelets and waffles with toppings. The service has always been great and the price is very reasonable. We come here several times a year and never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like the grilled salmon with fresh veggies. I wonder if they have a new cook. The food is excellent"}
{"text":"I was shocked to come here at 7 p.m. on a Saturday and see the parking lot was nearly empty. A friend and I decided to come here because we had a $10 off coupon.

We started with fried zucchini, which were delivered in six ginormous strips. They were good, but the batter was severely lacking salt.

Both of us got burgers. Mine was pretty solid, except the bottom bun got slightly soggy as I was eating it. The burgers are served with chips, which I thought would be made in house, but it was basically a bag of Lays poured onto my plate.

It wasn't a bad meal, just pretty mediocre. Service was good; the server we had was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"If it were a year earlier, this would be a glowing review. I usually like going here for a quick dinner with a step up from typical bar food. The dinners are usually pretty good and very affordable.

However, I made the mistake of going here for brunch. The service was horrific, despite only being half full. It took 30 minutes to get a drink and we never got any refills, even after flagging people down repeatedly. My daughter was net l nearly in tears.

The food on the buffet was mostly old and cold, only a couple things got refilled. And they must have been drunk when they decided on the menu, it made no sense and nothing went together. I would not recommend the brunch at all."}
{"text":"Middle road Inn of my favorite places to go!! The food is always amazing!! I recommend the steaks, wraps, wings,and you can never go wrong with the all you can eat crab legs on Thursday night! They also have the best ramch and balsamic vinagrette dressings!! The bar is always fun at night as well! There are always fun parties like the halloween party and they just gave aways Steeler tickets!! Definately need to check it out if you have not been here yet!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving just one star, though I was tempted. I realize that you have to take some places for what they are. Middle Road Inn is a bar. It's a dive with a nice lodge-y feel to it, and has a large bar space and several flat screens. We found it through Yelp after visiting the Hartwood Acres dog park. We checked the opening time (noon) and figured we'd stop in around 12:30 to watch some of the Pens game. 

The bar tender was anything but friendly. She made it clear that she was in the process of opening, and didn't want to help us. I can understand when you are just opening you could be a bit frazzled, but she was so rude about it. Plus, don't advertise to be open at 12 and not have your shit together by 12:30. My boyfriend (in a timid way cause she was pretty threatening) asked if he could get a water, she said \"no - I just opened so I don't have ice.\" OK, well, that's that.

A bit later once our drinks were slammed down in front of us, we ordered food. I ordered a veggie wrap with no fries or coleslaw. The food was awful in my opinion. BF isn't picky at all, and gobbled his greasy buffalo chicken wrap down. I really can't even look at coleslaw, and don't eat deep-fried foods, so I almost threw up when my veggie wrap came with fries and coleslaw ON it. There's no way around that , so I just pushed it away and ate chips. I didn't say anything to the bartender because honestly, I didn't want some spitfire remark. So I silently boxed up the wrap and saved it for the BF for later. 

It was just a bad experience, and for drinks, it's not a bad place at all... except for the service. So, just won't be back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I were at the restaurant last night and I found 2 hairs in my salad and 1 in my pasta! I have never experienced this at a restaurant in my entire life! (Yes, maybe once in a blue moon a hair will be found, but not 3!!!) I hardly touched my food so you would think that the waitress would notice, but not so much! It also took 45 minutes to get our meals and there were only 2-3 other tables in there! Needless to say, we will not be returning! EVER!"}
{"text":"Been here before but won't ever go back... We waited at the hostess stand for 20 min. Looking at plenty of open tables. Never got greeted at all and a line of 15 people built up behind us.. My sister politely asked the \"owner\" if we could please be seated bc we were on a time crunch. And she screamed in my sisters face!!!!! Another guest even told the \"owner\" she didn't need to yell at my sister like that, and she screamed again that she was the \"owner\" and she would not be talked to like that and it was not her job to satisfy guests. Then told my family and the other family that spoke up that we can leave. What a horrible display of proprietorship! Guest satisfaction is nowhere near the top of her list!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came to middle road for Easter brunch. We had a reservation and were a few minutes late and the girl who answered when I called to notify was very kind and understanding (I dunno why Siri didn't know where the heck we were). We walked in through the bar and I had to notice how nice that area was.. Looked like a brand new black granite bar top and big windows. Not like the previous reviews I've read... Maybe they just redid it or something. Anyway the dining room was PACKED tables close together with the buffet line intertwined... But they asked us if we wanted to sit on the patio and we were like YAS!! the deck was super cute, big and open we had plenty of room. The food on the buffet was mediocre in my opinion...but the made to order omelettes were a hit with my fam and the fresh waffles were fluffy and delicious. Shrimp cocktail was on point too. This was a real nice place for Easter brunch but I dunno if I'd come back for a regular meal."}
{"text":"Cool, underrated place for good food, cheap and good beer and excellent live music downstairs.  Several very talented musicians work and hang there so even though the downstairs entertainment area isn't enormous, you'll find talented artists performing there and it's an excellent pre/post venue to hang after hardwood acres festivals!"}
{"text":"I'm a little reluctant to write this review because I want to keep this place a secret. I've only eaten brunch here, but let me tell you it's the best brunch place I've ever eaten at. It's buffet style and there isn't much breakfast food to choose from, but what's there does not disappoint. You won't find powdery eggs here or rubbery sausage. They also have mimosas, which aren't necessarily their strong suit but will work if you're desperate. The service is always great and they have plenty of room for large groups. I highly recommend the Middle Road Inn!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had brunch here a couple of weeks ago. It was delicious and very reasonably priced for what was offered in the buffet."}
{"text":"Went for their Sunday brunch buffet. Very good food at a great price. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant restored my faith in finding good food in Pittsburgh.

So, I'm a recently transplanted California food snob and was sure the fare I found in the east would be less than impressive. I was proven wrong by this little gem. 

They have an extensive menu along with daily specials at mid-range prices. So far we've enjoyed the fettucini (w. chicken & scallops), french onion soup, crab bisque, chicken marsala, and fish dinner. 

Pasta sauces are incredible, serving sizes are very large and the dish flavors have been mostly fantastic. The chicken marsala was a little bland, as was the fish dinner. (The warm bread they serve is also delicious).

Atmosphere is casual, one side of the place is a bar, but it's still pretty quiet in the dining room. 

Service leaves a lot to be desired, though and is the only thing breaking Middle Road Inn from a 5-star review. We've had the same waiter both times we dined there, and it's been comically disappointing. Not very friendly, not very knowledgeable, more than a little awkward, and, a big pet peeve of mine: doesn't clear dishes from the table as you finish. Both times we ended up with stacks of dishes from our appetizers, dinners, and drink refills. 

But overall the food and creativity makes up for it. Big kudos to the chefs here."}
{"text":"I intend to go here again because i dont live far away however i want to see the newly remodeled downstairs. Because saturday it doesnt open till 9pm with all kinds of specials late night"}
{"text":"Food is usually very good...especially the burgers and fish. Nice atmosphere with outdoor seating in the summer!"}
