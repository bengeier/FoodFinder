{"text":"We went to Crazy Otto's for breakfast today based on a recommendation by complete strangers while waiting for our food the other day.  From the outside, it says keep going, but the food was really good. I ordered the french toast with scrambled eggs and hash browns. The french toast was great! The eggs and the hashbrowns could have been cooked a little more for my liking.  My boyfriend ordered the belgain waffles, eggs over easy and bacon. He said all of it was good. Even the side order or toast was fresh.  The only bad part  of the meal was the orange juice. It is a little pricey- $27 for two people for breakfast.  I'd consider going back..."}
{"text":"Very average or below average breakfast food, especially for the price, accompanied by below average service. Unless you're a regular, you do not feel welcome here. It saddens me to have to write this review, but I'm afraid the sausage I ate has caused me to feel sick all day, and honestly, I wouldn't want you, my fellow Yelp reader, to have a similar experience."}
{"text":"Visited there last weekend with my partner.   Previously I was a Waffle House fan, but I have a new favorite now. I ordered the crazy combo, which is a 1/2 order of ham, bacon and sausage (yes, all three) 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast.   First I'd like to address their half order of ham. We're talking almost an inch thick 6 inch wide hunk of ham. Seriously, between the ham, bacon and sausage, there was half a pig on my plate.   I have to admit that I'm anal about my eggs. I always order them over medium, and this is one of the few places that ever gets that right.  I didn't order the pancakes, but I saw it on another table and it was massive. Half an inch thick and bigger than the platter it came on. I'm afraid to see their Belgian waffles.  Everything was wonderful. Coffee service was borderline obsessive-compulsive. That's always a good thing.  I would be giving them 5 stars but my hash browns were more mushy than I like. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for awhile but lately the food quality has gone down and the prices are up. This is really a shame. Hometown diner feel with great friendly service. To bad the cook sucks! I guess we have to remove this from our list of places to eat. Bummer."}
{"text":"Terrible Food, delivered by a surly waiter on a dirty table.  If you like the ambience of listening to someone use the toilet, or if you like cold food that comes from a can and is delivered to you by someone who hates their life, then it's the perfect place to go.  Actually, my food was so bad that I took it home and was going to give it to my dogs but was afraid it would make them sick.  I've tried this restaurant 3 times, over 8 years, and everytime it's the same.  I keep hoping it will improve, as the location is easy, but it never fails to disappoint, and now, I'm not sure it isn't a health hazard as well.  The \"Line Cook\" Needed sign in window, is an understatement at best and a joke at worst.  This restaurant  needs Restaurant  Impossible, but I'm not sure that even Robert Irvine could help."}
{"text":"The entire meal is greasy. Call 911 I'm having a heart attack. The eggs are really greasy, the portion size is good. The bald headed white guy ruins the entire time. He is short, rude, no people skills at all. Never again will I go there, until they get rid of the bald headed white guy. Really is a hater, you can feel it oozing from him."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good. I had the sausage omelet and was practically licking my plate afterwards, but I was put off by the service. It was lackluster at best.  I would probably come back, but wouldn't make a special stop."}
{"text":"This place is totally awesome for quality home cook'in and an atmosphere to go with it. You won't go away hungry, the portions are big and the service is exceptional!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast a few times. I have no idea why this place is so busy. It's way overpriced on every single meal and not any better than any other breakfast place. I find the food boring and small. The standard price here is $9.00 or higher. There may be 3 items cheaper than that and they're all small. Their \"cheap\" breakfast is $4 for 1 egg and hash browns. I find that unacceptable. I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. You can go to Country Boys at 35 ave & Cactus for their standard $3 special with 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and meat and you get multiple breakfast options for $3.00 at Country Boys. The cheapest other  breakfast on this menu is $6.75-$7.50 for french toast and meat. Otherwise, you're paying $9+ for everything else. I've had the corned beef omelette, twice, boring, flavorless. Today I had 2 very small eggs, small portion of hash browns, and biscuits & gravy. The biscuits were large and homemade. Gravy flavorless.   I just wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Pricey. No flavor. Small portions. I'm only giving it 2 stars because they do serve giant pancakes. Get their pancake breakfast and split it between 2 people. I feel my self aggravated after paying so much for a meal when I'm leaving still hungry.   Go to Country Boys. If you don't get their $3 breakfast deals, you can print off buy 1 get 1 free coupons off their website. Anything you order on the regular menu is buy 1 get 1 free. If you've got 10 people in your group, you can use 5 coupons and get 5 breakfasts free.  My favorite breakfast place, Ollies Omelette House. 51 Ave & Olive. Quality. Fair pricing. Great food."}
{"text":"Have been going to crazy ottos for years. We had all our family get together s there when we lived closer. They were always very courteous even when we came in after the 12:00 mass with a group of people. We were never turned away. We pretty much stopped using this place as a family meeting place when we moved to a different part of the city. After not being there for quite a while we stopped one day when we were in the area, an much to our surprise, the waiter said he missed our family visits and ask how everyone was doing. We were treated like family. I forgot to mention the food or the memories it made when a grandson ordered three pan cakes with eggs and hash browns, I still Remember the look on his face or when our granddaughter ordered the hobo breakfast. Everyone at the table helped her eat it. My personal favorite is the half chicken liver omelet. Don't turn up your nose it's great I also love the gravy( I think it's made with ham or bacon drippings) mighty tasty. It's my wife's 73 birthday on Monday and she requested to go to Crazy Ottos for brunch. We will show up with 15 to 20 people and they will accommodate us as they always have. For my personal taste I  prefer them to the place, they serve bisquits that taste like. Bisquit made with baking soda not yeast."}
{"text":"First off I used to live by the Crazy Ottos in Acton CA and the food and service was always amazing. Today I was excited to try crazy ottos in Phoenix as I had business in Phoenix. Right from the start the waiter was an A$$hole!! He came to my table and said what are you having? I said I would like the corned beef hash & eggs over easy. He said what type of toast? I said I would like biscuits & gravy. He said we don't have biscuit & gravy. I said really isn't this the same crazy ottos as CA? He said it's kinda of like it and that the were out of biscuits & gravy. I said okay i will have sour dough and I'm also having a water. 5 minutes later the bus lady comes to my table with and omelet. I say sorry not what I ordered. My order came out about 5 min later. Portions were small compared to CA but it was good! I go to pay the Ahole waiter and ask what is the $2.10 charge. He says for your drink. I say really for water! He said oh I didn't know and fixed it but with an attitude. I can't believe I left this Ahole a tip I shouldn't have. I won't we back until he is fired!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place had biscuits and gravy it was amazing with my breakfast however been back 3 times since at 9 a.m. and they're out of biscuits and gravy now I recommend calling ahead if they don't have biscuits and I recommend leaving and going down the road to Ronnies cafe at 43rd Avenue and cactus they never run out"}
{"text":"BEST eggs Benedict I've ever had! Prices are a little high but it's a comfortable environment and friendly enough staff."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place of mine.  The spinach and cheese omelet (I get it without the bacon) is really good.  The pancakes are the best--do they have a secret ingredient in them that makes them better than other pancakes?  I'm trying to figure that out.  I just tried the corn beef hash and it was very, very delicious.  Biscuits and gravy are to die for.  The hobo eggs make the other huge portions seem positively wimpy- my father-in-law ordered it and I swear it was like 5 pounds of food.  He barely made a dent in it.  This is a great place for someone like me with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Small diner with cute decor. My niece got a HUGE waffle, yet when my. $9 Belgian waffle came out, it was nothing more than 2 Eggo waffles. When we brought it up to the waiter, he got an attitude with us, and said \"That's not an eggo, it's a waffle!\" and walkedc away. Be then went back to the cook and said \"they have an issue with the waffle.\" My waffle also came with a bowl is strawberries. All good, except that the strawberries were obviously not washed before they were swerved. Needless to say, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good breakfast at a decent price. Staff was very friendly and on top of everything. Good portions and the omelets were HUGE"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The owners a great people and seem to remember everything. I'm from a really small town in ohio and this place reminds me of home. The food is always good and there is a ton on your plate. I always get a ham and cheese omelet with an English muffin. Although a friend of mine got the French toast and i thought about stealing it. Great hidden gem. I will continue to be a regular here.   Try the pancake challenge if your man enough."}
{"text":"Portions are ridiculous, though the food sometimes lacks flavor.  The lil' man got the kids pancake which had to be the size of a 16\" pizza.  He had leftovers for two days for.  I ordered the hobo eggs which was also massive but didn't have any distinguishing ingredients or flavors that stood out.  Decent breakfast stop, but nothing to seek out."}
{"text":"I guess 3 stars is about right. I grew up in Lancaster eating Otto's every weekend with my father for many years. While this place is similar, it's not the Otto's of Christmas past. Portions are smaller,  I understand they need to make a buck, but it's still a $10 plate of breakfast food in which food cost is pretty low on potatoes and eggs. The chicken fried steak was ample, the food quality was decent. I was told at 9 am they already ran out of biscuits which was a let down. I noticed other reviews saying the same. The place isn't bad, but Ronnie's down the road does it as good if not better for less money."}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars they would get zero stars. To start with the gentleman serving told us, Verbatim \"we obviously got off from a bad start maybe you should choose a different restaurant to go to next time\" I was absolutely appalled. I will never go back to crazy ottos, nor recommend it to anyone all thanks to one very unhappy man who serves there all the time . I feel bad that the owner gets a bad rap because of the people working there (unless it's the owner himself the Caucasian man with glasses who's always cranky, but I'm fairly sure that is not the owner. This gentleman serves us every time we've gone in and every time we feel that we are inconveniencing him for coming into his/the restaurant 'crazy ottos' I used to send people there for the large plates of food with great taste however the service has finally just done it for me. I've never heard of a restaurant that will not let you substitute bacon for sausage or vice versa even Denny's would do that. If you like to be treated friendly by a personable happy server do not go to crazy ottos."}
{"text":"Love this place. really great breakfasts and LARGE portions. Been coming here for 6 years and love the food. Gets crowded on the weekends so be patient , the wait is worth it. Build your own omlete is 410.50 but i get three meals out of it."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid local breakfast spot. Nothing fancy but the food is tasty. Prices are a tad on the high side for breakfasts but the portions are HUGE. I recommend sharing a plate if possible. This place is not for the heart or health conscious! Coffee is farmer brothers brand and is nice and strong. Reminds me of coffee my grandparents would make.   I have tried the corn beef hash an eggs on two occasions and have not been disappointed. The corn beef and hash browns were both perfectly crispy. However, I didn't eat much of the biscuits and gravy as the gravy had a weird \"tang\" to it. It tasted like old oil or grease. I will stick with toast next time.   I will return to ottos for breakfast as it is located near my home and I try and patronize local businesses. I want to try the French toast and pancakes next!"}
{"text":"Great service, exceptional portions! Wife had French toast , bacon etc., large portions of bacon, thick cut , French toast hmmmmmm! Eggs Benedict can be sketchy but this place was par excellence' , hollandaise perfect. Otto uses sliced ham instead of Canadian bacon, but what's CB but expensive ham! I enjoyed it just the same!"}
{"text":"This was my first time by this place and wow. The proportions are huge! Prepare yourself to eat because the size of the plate infront you you will have your eyes gleaming. Not only is the food delicious but the people are friendly and make a great bond. I can proudly say, I love this place and will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Yummy! You have to have a serious appetite to finish a plate from here. The half omelette is bigger than any full I've seen. And someone at a table near by got the pancakes and they were huge! There was 4 of us that all ordered different things and everyone really enjoyed their meals. I ordered the Denver omelette and the ham inside was soooo good. Very juice and tender. Cute little place inside to. Diner feel for sure."}
{"text":"We had burgers for lunch at Otto's today, our first time here.  Immediate service, attentive staff, generous portions and really great tasting food.  Their cole slaw is an inventive combination that includes pineapple, which sounds unusual but it's really very good...and trust me, I am ridiculously picky about my slaw. Lots of tempting breakfast and lunch choices on the menu.  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, the place is easily accessible and immaculate inside and out.  We shall return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for breakfast, fantastic service, great tasting food, huge portions. Can't be beat!!  You have to try this restaurant , if you haven't already. My wife and I love it."}
{"text":"Huge, delicious portions for a reasonable price. I was even able to stay on track with my eating plan. We will be back!"}
{"text":"went here to meet a client in business. when the waiter asked for my order, he did not say \"Hello\" nor did he give eye contact. I ordered a Starbucks Frappacino thinking I'd get something similar that they serve at Starbucks...but they came back with a little bottle thing that you get at the convenience store and a cup. I said 'no I don't want that'. I expressed that I decided I didnt want anything.  My colleage did order and we continued the meeting. When they brought the order, the waiter reached over me as if I was not there. I complained and tried to tell the owner who said he did not care to hear my concerns. My colleage and I were appalled and left.  We are both in the music business. He is caucasian and I am black.  The owners are middle eastern or something. Maybe the discrimination was racial or maybe that they think women should not speak. I don't know. I just know why that place is small. the customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"Good food, best environment. Weekends are busy but that's expected. Good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this spot.    Great service and good breakfast.  Been many times I always get my money's worth."}
{"text":"We met our son and daughter-in-law here for Sunday morning brunch, based on YELP recommendations. Looked like a tasty and fun place to go.  The server was friendly, but the service itself was average.  My half spinach mushroom omelette was really greasy.  My husband ordered the full omelette which looked the same size of mine. We asked for tabasco and got wing BBQ sauce.  And the place wasn't even that busy.  Seemed they were not on their game. Likely won't be back and won't recommend to others."}
{"text":"I can't go back there any more.  I love the breakfast but I can't take David, the rude server anymore.  I've been going there for years and it is always the same.  The last time I was there, he made a big issue with another customer about my changing tables. I'm pleasant and courteous to him but he is just got some repressed issue. And despite his dour attitude, I've always tipped him well.  Carlos is great but he isn't usually serving.    Crazy Otto's is off my list."}
{"text":"This is a real \"Ma and Pa\" type of place. Breakfast is especially good here. There is a nice variety things on the menu. Choice is given for full or half orders of different dishes. No one should ever leave hungry!  Prices are good. Ambience could use some improvement. Waitstaff is quick. Carryout orders are labeled and very well packed. The restaurant is with another business in a stand alone building. The building I s in the middle of a parking lot which is located on a very busy crossroads corner. While there are parking places close to the restaurant door, if the restaurant and the other business are both busy it is very possible that you may have to walk through plaza traffic in order to go from your parking place into the restaurant. One star was taken away to account for the food lacking flavor, the parking issue, and due to the lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"Please go here for raw prime rib that u cannot eat and horrible customer service... oh yeah and a stomach ache and nausea all day"}
{"text":"If your main selection for breakfast is omelets, your cook should not send one out that is brown, omelets are tricky to get just right. The dogs liked it.....The gravy, for old fashion saw mill gravy you should be able to see the pepper. A little seasoning goes a long way. Nothing was seasoned......This is my second time here, I should not have given it a second chance, because the first time was not impressive. I really don't understand why it is so busy at breakfast. There are much better places, that are less expensive....habit for some I guess!"}
{"text":"My breakfast sanwhich was good.  However the rudeness of the male servers made us NEVER want to return.  My nana is in her 80s.  The disrespectful manner in which you spoke was absolutely not ok.  If you want business, kindness matters.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Prices are very reasonable. You get a ton of really great food for less than a lot of other places. Warning: you will never see bigger pancakes than the ones here. You will Def want to share."}
{"text":"I found myself here staring at the menu thinking \"they have whole and half omelets, what can the difference really be?\"  I decided that there's no way a whole omelet anywhere could beat me.  I was very, very wrong.   The full omelet here is truly impossibly huge. I'm rarely beaten by breakfast but, wow.  The bacon and avocado that it was stuffed with was the perfect combination of flavors.  The toast was a little on the underdone and cool side, but in the face of that heap of eggs and hash browns, it kind of gets pushed aside anyway."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday Morning around 9:30ish... Trust me a good time to eat here.. I've been to this place at earlier times and it gets really busy. This place isn't that big, but wow is the plate sizes. Crazy amount of food for a fair price.   Picture the show: Man vs. Food, this is otto's with every dish they put out..  I ordered the Chirzo Burrito, and my husband ordered the Machaca Plate. We both ordered coffee. The coffee was nice and strong, really woke us up that morning. The service was right on que, filling our cups numerous times, so we got pretty wired before our food came out.   When our food came out we dug in.. oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin about.   My Chirzo burrito was freakin huge, and the meat, potato's, and sauce was really good. There's just something about Otto's Potato's that are my favorite.. They taste so fresh so perfect. Ok, this may sound weird but I've eaten here before and just ordered a side of potato's, I know.. that's really bad, lol.. but they are deli sh..   I only got about half of my burrito eaten before I thought I was going to burst. My husband meal was huge also.. I took a few bites of his, and it was good to. I think next time I come back though I'm going to stick with a morning classic dish, with some eggs, potato's (of course) and an English Muffin's are so good too, lots o' butter).   All I can say is:  \"Get in my Belly\""}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. What A Wonderful Place and Such Delicious & Hearty Food. Breakfast is My Favorite Meal and Ottos is gonna be My Favorite now that im moving Back Home"}
{"text":"Ok service but the food is not good.  Horrible coffee, dried out ham, and the worst biscuits and gravy I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Nice dinner. Clean and fast service. Really nice size omelette's. When you order a omelette if it's a full size it's 6 egg's or half is 3 egg's. So I really like the bacon and Swiss cheese omelette with hash browns and a large biscuits with gravy."}
{"text":"Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.  I walked into this place freshly showered and smelling like roses, but walked out smelling like grease, clogged arteries, and fat induced mothballs. Yuck.   I found this country diner on yelp and was smitten by the \"world's largest omelet\" sign on their window and reviews of large, huge, and monty python sized portions. Holler. I walked in and asked for their \"world's largest omelet,\" which is actually a world record Crazy Otto's broke in year 2002, thus the \"credit.\" Oh. I was a bit disappointed, I'll admit. So I ask for the the \"full\" size ortega beef omelet (6 eggs), hash browns, biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were dry and the gravy was drier. The omelet was pretty large, but came with a puddle of grease on top of it. The hash browns were...hash browns. The Ortega beef chunks were probably the best thing about my meal. Even better, was the service. I don't know if he was the manager or what, but he told us a little bit about the history and origination of Crazy Otto, which served to be interesting and food for thought. So...they get 2 stars for service and portions.  Look, I love diners. I love huge portions, bustling waitresses that call you \"honey,\" and hearty, soul food meals that are full of carbohydrates, but this place was just way too greasy. It's a wonder how my perfume mixed with my hairspray didn't ignite a blazing flame throughout this place with the amount of grease that was in the air, seats, and food?! Holy smokes.  Will I ever go back? I'm all for second chances, but the thought of it just made me throw up a little in my mouth. So the answer is gonna have to be no, for now.  *Shivering*"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST PANCAKES I have ever had, IN MY LIFE.   It would be foolish on your part to not make it a point in your life to eat ANYTHING here.   Eveyone that I was with enjoyed their meals. Well, we more than enjoyed our meals. I don't now that there is word for how much I loved my pancakes.  They are absolutely massive and delicious. The edges are a little crispy. They must cook them in some type of magical laboratory... with butter.   The other people I was with had a BLT and a grilled chicken sandwich. The BLT was certainly not skimpy on the bacon and the chicken in the grilled chicken sandwich was moist and delectable.   Go to Otto's now. NOW I tell you."}
{"text":"Crazy Otto's is crazy good.  I had a bacon and pepper jack cheese omlette (half order) and stupidly ordered the biscuits and gravy thinking it would be one bisuit with a bit of gravy.  It was two huge biscuits smothered in gravy.  The omlette was delicious and the bacon was really good (thick cut and meaty rather than fatty).  The hash browns were good too.  The biscuit was fluffy and wonderful as was the gravy.  Looking forward to leftovers when I am hungr again, which won't be for a long, long time."}
{"text":"I've been to Crazy Otto's a few times now, most recently this past weekend.  I was hungry and opted for the eggs, bacon and pancake combo.  I got the fair warning of how huge the pancakes are and accepted the challenge.  The order came out quickly (I imagine its a simple plate to make, especially as a single order).  I cleared out my eggs and bacon (thick cut and delicious) quickly and made my way to the pancakes.  Needless to say I only made it through half of the triple stack.  They probably could served as a meal by themselves as they are larger than a full size dinner plate.  Overall service was great, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Crazy Otto's at least once every 2 months for the past 6+ years!  Most of the visits were when we actually lived out of town or out of state and when visiting friends / Family this is our \"go to\" breakfast spot. And now that we are living in AZ again our visits are more often. Small but very busy, friendly with great food and yes huge portions!! We like it!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good price. Great little place. I don't understand why so many places get breakfast so wrong but this is NOT one of them! Big menu, big portions, perfect place to power down right before a Saturday morning nap!"}
{"text":"Great diner breakfast HUGE portions good coffee. We will be back"}
{"text":"This is the bomb for breakfast. Name your own omlette, ham, bacon sausage, chorizo, grilled onions its huge $10 w/american fried potatoes and good coffee, like $10 but there's enough for three meals. Really good BLT too."}
{"text":"The waiter told me to leave after a I ask about the biskis and grave just took my water and said leave never been treated this way in a restaurant in my life,  I have 25 years in this business myself 18 years as a general manager don't go there ever so rude no wonder there was no one in there. The first one was in Lancaster, CA great place love the food and the service."}
{"text":"Country Diner alert!!  All your breakfast  and lunch diner favorites !  We have passed this place literally a million times and kept wondering what the food is like.  Well we wonder no more.  For lunch today we stepped into a bit of what reminds me of an Oklahoma Diner , I could almost see my  country country cousins stopping by this place.  The menu is full of classic sandwiches like French Dip, Monte Cristo, Hamburgers and other American Sandwich Staples.  The menu is big on Breakfast and has lots of Omelettes to chose from .They even mark all the low carb items so you for those South Beachers it's a little easier.   For starters Linda our server was instantly like family, she was sweet and kind . I love the way she talked to my daughter like she already knew her , \"So Sammy what are we having today?\" Linda was extra helpful and made great recommendations  .She even warned us about the size of portions and boy she wasn't kidding. Linda did a great job keeping glasses full and prompt service. We noticed in this small establishment  there  were four servers , whoa that's rare these days.   I had the avocado Omelette which is big , with super nice chunks of avocado , no salsa  but I never asked for any either. The hash browns were not my favorite style  more mashed than chunky but you decide. You can chose yummy fresh made daily biscuits or toast.   Plus One( husband) had the  Prime rib and eggs breakfast which he couldn't finish. The prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good, considering we are in a diner.  This is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it's perfect. This also comes with hash browns, eggs, and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy. If I wasn't low carbing it that would have been lunch!   The decor is cute and quaint. The care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.They talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were. When you are passing thru No Pho   give them a try.  They are open for  lunch and breakfast  only."}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times but never really stopped in until today. I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which is on sour dough bread and it was very good. It came with hash browns which were excellent. It's a down to earth style diner and the atmosphere reminded me on Chicago. Great place I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The breakfast was overpriced, and the food arrived cold. The tablecloth smelled like it was wiped with a dirty rag. I'm not coming back, which is too bad because my friend recommended this place to me"}
{"text":"The food was okay the service was okay but the guy at the register bald guy was rude, Mostly burnt out career servers, that have been there for a ever. But its close to the house so we may be back, North phoenix really need a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"hobo eggs dish = ridiculous. My waiter warned me that it was \"alot of food\". I thought, ok, it's gonna be a big plate of food.  I was wrong, way wrong. It's not a big plate of food, it is a MOUNTAIN of food! http://twitpic.com/awqxk A tasty mountain of hashbrowns, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers & eggs, with the majority of it being hashbrowns. This behemoth of a serving had me shocked & joyed. Crazy Otto's made my day yesterday. I'll be eating leftovers all week."}
{"text":"This place has a throw back diner type of feel to it. I is a little neighborhood place that I think mostly locals really know about. This is by far a breakfast restaurant, which HUGE breakfast  helpings. When they give you the option of a half or full serving, you should really give some thought to the half serving. However, I do believe in going big or going home.  This is one place where I try something new every time and this was the third time I have been here. Their omelets  are very good and the full serving is the way to go. Their Philly Cheese Steak was average and I felt like it was a little under sized. Finally there are the pancakes....these have to be the largest pancakes in the valley! They are just huge and hang over the edges of the plate.  If you are searching for a old fashioned diner or just in the mood for a truly filling breakfast, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Mike & Rhonda's is our \"go-to\" place but on this fine morning we found the line to be WAY-TOO long to negotiate.  Further down the road is Crazy Otto's  The greetings were warm and the place is cozy.  The menu had the promise of a great meal and the excitement built as we all ordered.  Upon the first bites of each of our party of 4 our collective excitement subsided into a bland plate of mediocrity.  Painful to have such harsh word were the kindness and customer service are 4 star....but sadly the food is bland and in need of a kick in the pants.  A very nice \"thank-you\" rang in my ear as we departed, and I hope the Crazy Otto will raise his game to where I know it could be.  Tons of potential."}
{"text":"While I reserve the right to upgrade this my gut is 3.5 stars rounded down Thanks yelp.   Service:  5 stars, granted there were only us and 2 others for a short time. The staff was great and friendly.   Food:  2.5 Stars, I had a burger and knew that it was not going to be the best burger ever but decided to try it anyway. They Flat Grill (fry) a hand pattied 1/2lb burger and serve it with mayo, mustard, 1000 Island, let and tom. While it was not over cooked it was too thin to cook med rare. The flavor was ok but there was no seasoning at all on it.  The fries needed salt desperately also.  There was a small and I mean small cup of what appeared to be coleslaw.. wow it was bad.   Building:  3 Stars Clean open, plenty of light. Looked nice to me.   I WILL be back for some breakfast."}
{"text":"I started coming here with coworkers and I really enjoy it. There's a small town feel with this diner and the food is good. This is not a cookie cutter diner like Village Inn or Denny's, so don't expect a three dollar breakfast that leaves you feeling still hungry at the end.  The portions are big but a little pricy hence my four star review. The staff is friendly and quick to get you your food and drinks. I read other reviews that the staff was rude, but that hasn't been my experience at all.  This place deserves at least one try from everyone. Some will really like it and others may not, but give it a try. I did and I will be back for many years to come.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good food in a nice diner atmosphere. Food came quick and was delicious once we got it. A little pricey, but you can get anything you'd expect from a diner. Good place for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"3-12-2016  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!. 3 Tables seated after us were waited on first; They just walked past us and ignored us. We have lived in the neighborhood for over 30 years. We will never ever go back and will NOT recommend this place to any people. The one \"gentleman\" seems to have a problem with customer service. We have seen this before and poor customer service before \"everyone has a bad day\" this \"gentleman\" seem like everyday is bad for customer service"}
{"text":"Did not like at all. Food was super greasy and sloppy. Hashbrowns were burnt. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"Pros: Huge portions Friendly, down-to-earth atmosphere Good omelets, pancakes, ham steak, biscuits & gravy, homemade hash browns Good coffee    Cons: I think it's better to stick to the breakfast menu.  The lunch items have not been as good.  The exception is the club sandwich which my husband loves.  The food is good for a greasy spoon, but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Don't order the pancakes!  Well, unless you are going to share. They are bigger than a dinner plate. Otto himself was waiting on me and when I ordered the pancakes with scrambled and bacon he took a look at my aging self and recommended I get the kids portion which only comes with one pancake instead of 3.  I still didn't finish it.  Most of the omelets are available in a smaller size too.    There is nothing fancy or pretentious about the food, the service or the atmosphere.  Just basic and well done.  Outside dining is folding chairs and tables.  This is not a place you go to be alone with yourself or others in your party.  All the tables are in the open and you end up talking to your neighbors and pretty soon you start to feel like one of the family.  As an example of basic the check has a list of what was ordered and a total,no line item pricing no break out of tax, just a total.  It works and it fits the atmosphere.  I got there just before 7 on a Saturday morning and was only the second occupied table at that time.  By the time I left at 7:30 it was starting to pick up.  They also do take out."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.    The guy barely spoke to us,  didn't check on us,  just horrible felt like we bothered them by going in to eat."}
{"text":"We ended up here because Cracker Barrel had a long wait and a north Phoenix Good Egg closed down..I remembered seeing this place while shopping at the Fresh and Easy across the street and always wanted to try it and was glad we did.   We drove up to find it wasn't too busy which worried me lol..atmosphere reminded me of a small town diner and was bright and clean. I ordered the turkey and cheese omelette with hash browns and biscuits and gravy.   Food was cooked perfectly and flavorful and all I can say is come hungry because they aren't stingy with the portions.. Biscuits were huge and smothered with this awesome bacon gravy. I saw them bring out pancakes to a girl and imagine 3 medium pizzas on your plate and that's what size these pancakes were..I think she was embarrassed for having a plate with so much food lol.   The place filled up after we got there but seems to be a hidden gem in this North Phx shopping center. They serve lunch but haven't  tried that yet. If you want to avoid the long weekend brunch lines check Crazy Otto's out and make sure you have someone who can wheel you out lol."}
{"text":"Love it !!  I'm from Iowa and that is as close to that Midwest comfort food as you can get !!  Huge menu & HUGE portions.  Very friendly & attentive staff !!  Would recommend for breakfast or lunch !!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best omletes in the valley. Kick butt atmosphere and the owners are the cutest sweetest guys in the world."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would... Waiter was rude..He needs manners. Was a little pricey for atmosphere.  Breakfast for two was 26.08$ not even name brand jelly (WHAT!! no Smucker's for these prices) on table for toast. My Spinach omelette was greesey, hash browns under cooked... Cornbread hash was dry hash browns under cooked as well biscuits were tall cake like biscuits with not enough gravy to handle the biscuits. . (Feel better served if cut in half gravy on top) When our food was given to use so was our check.. The place wasn't busy and I was going to order a breakfadt to go for my daughter.. we must of hit the sweet spot for time 9am-930 soo I feel placing what I owe with the food I purchase puts a BAD TASTE in my mouth. Will not eat here again ... This was their second chance with my hard earned money that I want to spend it elsewhere but here."}
{"text":"A very standard diner with all the things one would expect to see.  An old fashioned cash register, typical older style tables / chairs, and a greasy feel in the air.  The pancakes are bigger than your head - fair warning!  You'll want to share those mammoths with someone if you order them. My fiancee had the corned beef hash which he enjoyed.  I think the down side to this location would have to be the service. They seem to be very efficient with getting food on and off the table, but other than that it's not overwhelmingly personable here. It's a busy location so I can forgive the idea of wanting to flip the table quickly to handle the rush(es) for the most part, but ringing up someone's bill without talking to them is a but much.    Overall: B Definitely an \"A-OK\" place to eat if you are in a diner breakfast mood."}
{"text":"Probably wont be giving this place a second chance. Came in Thursday morning (4th of July) with my fiancé because we had heard many good things about it. The service was great. Coffee cups stayed full and the staff was very kind. And the prices were pretty cheap.  The only disappointment was the food. We both got omelets and my fiancé ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. The omelets were thin. It was like an egg crepe with ham, onions and cheese stuffed in the middle. The biscuits weren't that great and the gravy was terrible. It had no flavor whatsoever.  It's so unfortunate that their food was so bland because the service and prices are great."}
{"text":"Can't really say much about crazy Otto's diner. The waiter made a snarky comment to my father while he was trying to order  The food was very bland and had no flavor. The price for the two of us with a cup of coffee included was $24 dollars   this was way too high for the quality of the food and service that we received. We will not be coming back to this place again"}
{"text":"From the outside Crazy Otto's looks like the kind of place I would pass by without a second glance. (Although the name is pretty catchy so I suppose I might look twice.) Inside the decor is simple, license plates adorn the walls and the tables are just tables. But where this place really stands out is in the food.  I had read the other reviews and expected to see gigantic pancakes. Crazy Otto's did not disappoint! These things were huge! The spilled off the platter. Platter mind you, not plate. The boyfriend ordered the stack of three. One would have been enough, even with me stealing a few bites. I ordered the eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The bacon was fine, nothing amazing, but the scrambled eggs were cooked just right and the hashbrowns were the best hashbrowns I have had in Phoenix. Only Al's Breakfast in Minneapolis has better 'browns. They were cut thicker than most and had a rich buttery potato flavor. I would go back to Crazy Otto's just for that alone.  Overall, I would say if you care more about what's on your plate than what's around you, you'll love breakfast at Crazy Otto's."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Portion are big, food is great. This is not a place you come to for fast bite to eat. This is a sit down, enjoy, have a conversation place. Love it"}
{"text":"The American love affair of  breakfast =  eggs has always frustrated me. It's my living version of the  Monty Python spam song. Trying to substitute eggs in most places leads to the kind of look that could be expected had you asked them to reassemble an already cracked egg and push it  into the hen's vent for the next diner.  -  So I didn't even try .  I ordered a open face chili burger and hashbrowns. They'd run out of biscuits, yep that's why there's no five.  No biscuits and gravy is as acceptable as unsweetened ice tea.. never:)  The dish that arrived was a housing project! I am no stranger to the x3 hash browns at the Waffle Hut ( I take my  bitch there after all ) but I couldn't  clear my plate and nor could my wife finish hers .  We're seriously thinking about splitting a plate between us next time.   Coffee service was constant, almost religiously so.  This is a real breakfast , for a really fair price and I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Overall, a less than stellar experience. Now I don't always expect everyone to be cheery and friendly, but I don't think one single employee in the restaurant smiled at me or my boyfriend. Not even when I smiled at them? Three different servers assisted us, none of them came back more than once. No one even came back and asked if our food was ok or if we needed anything else. A lady slapped our check down on the table and walked away. I had to go up to the counter to pay, before I was able to get someone's attention for a to go box (figured my roommates bf might eat the half of my meal I didn't want). I mean, if the food would have been delicious, it probably would have been worth it. However, I was unimpressed with the food as well. Needless to say, we won't be going back for breakfast anytime soon..."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted and asked for our dink request. Very nice and friendly service.  It has an old fashion diner feel, very comfortable.  Although the biscuit were a little dry,  everything else was great."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and always knows my order, steak, eggs(soft scrambled) . Thanks for awesome food"}
{"text":"Been to Crazy Otto's for two times and will definitely be back. Tip, bring your appetite!!!  This is a place which you will feel instantly at home. Exactly what you will picture thinking of a local diner.   I went here with a few friends and couldn't believe the size of pancakes! I honestly think 2 or 3 people can share them. I'm hoping that Man vs Food comes here to attempt to eat them! I tasted them and they were good.   On the two times I've been here I've had the omelette. I had the avocado, bacon, cheese and  just the bacon and cheese with cheddar. I have to say probably the best omelette I've ever had. Comes with a hash browns and choice if toast or biscuits and gravy.  Come here early because sometimes they run out of biscuits. Great breakfast. I've only had the half order but for a dollar more get the full sized. I know I'll come back with my wife and we will end up sharing.   Easily one of the best local restaurants in northern Phx if not in the valley. I've always had good service as well."}
{"text":"We were met at the door and offered a table...coffee right away and menus. Our order was taken quickly and the food came steaming hot. I really liked my breakfast. I'll be back, it was great. They've got this system down to a science."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!! Ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. It didnt have any chorizo in it at all! It was dry and made of corn beef hash. Which they are trying to pass off as chorizo I guess. When I asked if they had maybe got my order wrong the waitress simply said No you got the chorizo burrito. However I am SURE that is not what I got. Couldnt even eat it and they didnt even care. I spoke with the owner about it and all he said was that he would love to take me into the kitchen and \"show me\" the chorizo. TERRIBLE customer service and the WORST breakfast I have ever had! Its really hard to screw up breakfast! Dont waste you time!!"}
{"text":"Crazy Otto's is truly a crazy place.  Not knowing that this was a breakfast and lunch only place, we arrived at 1:50.  Closing time was posted as 2:00.  We went in, expecting to be asked to come back another day, and were going to try the middle eastern place across the street.  but the waiter told us, \"The sign says we're open till 2, so if you show up at 1:59, we're happy to serve you!!\" And happy it was.  We even had a nice chat about the economy and how it is not economical to stay open past 2 these days unless you get a large dinner crowd.     The food was nothing short of delicious, and the decor is, well, crazy.  LIke the waiter said, \"check you licesne plate on the way out, it might wind up on the wall!\"    I had been looking for a good BLT for a few months now, and when I ordered one here, I expected just another typical BLT.  But I was surpised by the genoerous amounts of Bacon in the thing.  Most places just give two or three slices, but this one had plenty more than that, and crunchy, too!! A generous helping of mayo made irt all the better.  The order of Onion rings had only 5 rings, but they were huge, so it was like getting a large order from some fast food place.    I can't wait to go back and enjoy this place again!!"}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon, good customer service, good prices, giant portions"}
{"text":"It's a nice little place to stop in for a quick bite to eat. The French toast and bacon were really good however I didn't like their style of scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"The man who took our order was extremely rude I will never come back to this dump, he had no professionalism"}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for a good breakfast spot. This is definitely going on the list of regular places to visit. I had an enormous pancake the size of my plate; flavorful with crispy edges..perfect! The waitress informed me that 1 would be enough for me, so I had an egg and 2 slices of bacon. All very good. The coffee was good too, an added bonus :) My husband had the avocado omelette which was also very, very good. Interior of the restaurant wasn't anything exciting...but the food makes up for it. Server was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Solid.  Good food, lots of it, good service, lots of it.  Love the convenience of the counter service.  Could have used more spice but next time I'll just order a menu item  with that specific intent."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service,  gravy could have been more spicy, will go back to try a crazy Otto burger"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on at Otto's but we were not made to feel welcome the past couple of times and the food seems mediocre at best - so I'm downgrading my review accordingly, I no longer recommend it as a place to go."}
{"text":"Heres the deal its a great neighborhood go to - the pancakes and omelets are the big draw and the french toast is good to. They offer lunch items as well and i dig the shrimp plate :) staff is really on point and friendly and u find everyone from early worker bees to people in jammy attire :)"}
{"text":"The sausage omelet was hearty, with large chunks of what looked like link & patty sausage. I was told that my choice of side (biscuits and gravy) would be just one biscuit...as it was the last one! I thought that was kind of strange as it was only 10:30am. That was alright, as the Smokey flavor of the gravy was something that I did not enjoy at all. That and the biscuit was hard and bland. The hash browns were crispy on the outside, but not done all the way thru like I enjoy. The service was good, refills frequent and the staff was friendly. I had heard how wonderful this place was, the décor and seating is Plain Jane, with a lot of tables right next to each other. After reading some of the other reviews, I will be back to try the plate-size pancake, and the super fluffy done just right eggs."}
{"text":"The best place and it has History, they have been in Guiness for making the Biggest omelet with 36,0000 eggs.Great breakfast and Lunch, a must to go. The owner is amazing, treated me like a queen.  Will go here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty. Their pancakes are huge and yummy here. Coffee is so so and hashbrowns are only ok."}
{"text":"Food was great. However The servers appeared very unhappy. Service was satisfactory but certainly wasn't service with a smile. Also was waiting for the Crazy Otto train to have the chance for a free meal but no deal. Probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan. It was probably the worst breakfast I've had since moving to Arizona and all it was was eggs home fries and toast."}
{"text":"Where to begin, Im from Lancaster so I have to say maybe I was spoiled because this location definitely misses the mark. I walk in and rather than being seated the guy points to a cluster of tables for me to sit at.  Not sure who my server was, the guy who took my order didn't do anything but take my order and a combo of 2-3 different faces delivered my food, drinks, refills.  The guy who took my order on the other hand lets call him \"baldy\" (not sure if he is the manager or owner or just a server) couldn't help but mention to everyone walking in the door including myself that they were closing in an hour even though it was more like an hour and a half.  Also that was the reason they didn't have biscuits and gravy too.  Later while waiting for my I overhear \"baldy\" telling/bragging to customers that he has asked people to leave rather than accommodate their requests.  Scotties omelette,  my favorite from Lancaster, the egg was under cooked, had raw egg whites still, but now I'm afraid to complain because I've already heard what happens to complainers.  Also I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure the chili is different, It was pretty bland I added a heafty amount of pepper and tapatio which I never did before.  Needless to say, my pure excitement of finding my favorite breakfast joint in Phoenix turned out to be a total disappointment."}
{"text":"So when someone puts a lot of subpar food on my plate it really just leads to a lot of subpar food getting thrown out.  I wish this place would focus more on quality than quantity.  I ordered the meat combo that featured ham, sausage, and bacon.  The ham was just okay, the sausage was lame, and the bacon was too hard.  The 6 pounds of hashed-browns that were under all of this meat were terrible.  The only saving grace were my eggs.  They were some of the best scrambled eggs ever.  Nothing special about them, they were just the perfect flavor, texture, and consistency.    The service was good and the place is cute.  I enjoyed looking at the license plates on the wall and they have some train that gives out free food.  Those are good things, I think."}
{"text":"Crazy Otto's is a family tradition.  The omelettes are good (order the half order - I beg of you!), the bacon is great and the pancakes are fabulous.  We usually order one pancake for the table and it's more than enough.  They are quick with the coffee pot which is a big plus.  In addition, the staff are really nice.  I once saw the owner be super nice to a little boy that was being berated loudly by his Mother...the boy was just being a kid and she kept yelling at him to sit still, be quiet, etc.  David offered him some crayons and a coloring book while he waited which was very sweet."}
{"text":"Came in for the advertised house specialty Prime Rib and Eggs. Turns out they didn't get their delivery of Prime Rib which could be understandable but they don't tell you that until you get $10 in drinks delivered. A little heads up would have been nice. I might have still eaten here and come back but I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Waiter was short with me and unfriendly. Food was cold and under cooked.  A to go box and my stove made the food edible.  First and last time dining there!"}
{"text":"A-Ok  Nice place. Nice people.  Not a destination for a burger.  Hope to try breakfast soon."}
{"text":"I attempted the Hobo Eggs! Apparently only 9 people in 6 years have finished it.  I didn't even come close.  Although it should be renamed the Hobo Potatoes, as it is mostly potatoes, not eggs."}
{"text":"Wait time for food is REALLY long. If you have no place to be, then this is the place for you. But God for bid you have plans. Forget about it. You will be late."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees, awesome food, and the portions are insanely huge. Definitely a place to go when nearby.."}
{"text":"HUGE portions of classic American breakfast favorites are served up in a cozy, casual atmosphere decorated by license plates from every U.S. state as well as miscellaneous choo choo train decor.    Order small, or bring a big appetite.  Pancakes are great, and served with very high quality Appalachian maple syrup.  Omelets and hash browns don't disappoint either.  Come early or late, because the breakfast rush hours can be busy.  Actually don't come late, because when they run out of biscuits they won't make more.  Silly policy if you ask me.  Seems to be a favorite of local law enforcement which is a good sign in my book."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food, the staff is rude and very unhelpful. My aunt called in trying to place an order and find out about the menu and was hung up on. They don't care about the customers, and don't take the time to help an elderly person.   Would not recommend going to a place that treats people the way this place does."}
{"text":"First thing I have to say, is believe all the other reviews when they talk about the amount of food you will get here!  The second thing I have to say is that everything is average.  Crazy Otto's excels with service, as it is extremely quick, attentive, and efficient.  We were able to have breakfast in under 30 minutes.  That's a good thing for me.  The food however is just average at above average prices.  I got bacon, eggs, toast, and hashbrowns for my meal.  I was served a massive platter of food that I knew I wouldn't finish.  The bacon was okay, but unfortunately some parts of it were burnt.  The eggs (scrambled) were actually really good!  They were light and fluffy and very tasty.  The hashbrowns were no good.  I never get good hashbrowns unless I am at Matt's.  I was pleasantly surprised that nothing felt very greasy.  I probably won't go back because there about a million other places just like it and I would rather go somewhere new."}
