{"text":"Brandi's sports bar is your regular sports bar. Food is good. It's bar food. Stop by when you're around the area..."}
{"text":"A nasty dive.  Smokey, dirty floors and the restrooms (both) were disgusting.  My wife went in and right back out refusing to use the facilities.  And the food. The french fries tasted like fish.  I could say more but will leave it at that.  Not worth wasting your money or time."}
{"text":"I received an gift certificate online for 20.00. I chose this place because it is close by and I love deep dish pizza. So I call up to.place my order for pick up. The guy chris was pleasant until I mentioned the gift certificate.  He had to ask someone about it and they said it was dine in only. Completly untrue. No where does it say that. I have to use it there but I honestly dont want to."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great people. Whether you're an Illinois transplant or just visiting, Brando's is the place to be to enjoy an ice cold beer while cheering on our Chicago teams."}
{"text":"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! My husband and I were hungry last night so we decided to try their pizza. We ordered a 14 inch w/ pepperoni and I asked for it well done.  We loved it!  The crust was great! I was even tempted to ask if I could buy some of the dough. Just make sure  the server does not serve your beverage in a cracked plastic cup..."}
{"text":"It's a little dive bar, that serves Chicago style pizza.  I usually call in to order, 30% of the time their kitchen is closed.  It's pretty sad when you have a good food and no one to run it."}
{"text":"I just moved to the Blue Diamond/Southwest area this past September and always drive past Brando's on my way to work,  I finally decided to check this place out this week to kill my curiosity. The atmosphere had a home feeling about it the people were friendly and service was great. I'm originally from New  York so I appreciate good pizza and I was very surprised how good their pizza was. I'm glad i finally checked this place out and love that its so close to home. I would suggest this place to anyone especially if your wanting a comfortable hang out spot with friends or watch your favorite sports team (they have more than enough flat screens televisions) If you visit You MUST try the PIZZA :)"}
{"text":"OK, so went back with the entire family to try the Chicago style food. Sean remembered us, including all our names, so I am giving Brando's five stars for hospitality. The food was good but not what I would consider outstanding. We only tried the dogs and beef sandwiches between the four of us. The unique dog toppings (including tomato slices) made for an interesting twist but we all thought that the dog itself could have been a little bigger to compete with all the toppings. The shaved beef sandwich was very good and my son ordered it \"dry\" while I ordered it \"wet\". We both agreed the \"wet\" was superior by far and on the next trip I think I will try \"soggy.\" If you give this a go, definitely go \"wet\" as a minimum.    By Vegas standards, the food prices were very fair and dare I say, cheap. In and out with dinner for 4 including beers all around and a healthy tip for the good service at under $70. So, overall, I am going to stay with 4-stars. 3 for the food, 4 for the prices, and 5 for the hospitality. Obviously everyone has their own opinion but if you have never been to Brando's I think it would be a very safe bet to a least give your own taste a spin."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Chicago bar in Vegas!!! There are three different styles of pizza to choose from, including the recent addition of deep dish (I say try one of each!!!). The beef sandwich (they even understand the lingo...wet, dry, sweet, hot) is also great. They always have Chicago games on, and it's the best place to watch hockey in the area. I absolutely love everyone that works there, too. Go there enough, and they become like family! I love Brandos!!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't think it was going to be that good when I walked in but I was surprised maybe the best wings I have had and pizza was very  good"}
{"text":"Only thing I've eaten here was extra thin crust Chicago style pizza. Sooo freakin good. Every time. Service decent, and surprisingly not that smoky."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot dog and beef sandwich to go. The place smelled like an ashtray. When I got home and bit into the dog I almost chipped my tooth. The bun was hard and stale. The toppings on the dog weren't fresh and the so called \"Vienna beef\" hot dog had snot coming out of it.. My \"wet\" beef sandwich was mushy.  Beef wasn't fresh at all. And the wedge fries had been previously frozen 6 times.. Taste like warm salty cardboard.. This place is a disgrace to Chicago food. An absolute embarrassment. The owner clearly does not care about the image.. What a joke.. I was going to call and complain but a yelp review will serve better.."}
{"text":"Ive said it before - I like a good dive bar, and this place is a dive and has a feel that is not Vegas-y which can be a nice change.  However they leave ALOT to be desired.  We stopped here for some dinner sine we had a restaurant.com certificate.  We asked what the sever/bartender if there were any happy hour specials.  He saw our restaurant.com certificate and said \"With that, that's your special\".  Well OK then.  After a few minutes deliberating over the menu another gentleman came over to take our order - they were all out of the first FOUR THINGS I ORDERED.  I saw another review that mentioned they were out of a lot of food when they were there at 10PM...well this was only 7PM prime time for dinner - and out of half the menu!!!  The guy taking our order was nice enough.  The food was fine, nothing out of this world - bar food.  I got a burger on sourdough bread with fries(from frozen). It was very quiet when we were in there - just a couple older locals having a beer.  I am kind of surprised they are still in business.  I would not recommend bothering to try it out."}
{"text":"Deep dish was awesome! Nice place to sit and watch your fave ball game! Great attention at the bar!"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff. Good deep dish, not the best.. but I'd go here when I'm in the mood for deep dish."}
{"text":"We found this gem when we were sick of the strip. Great Chicago sports bar with authentic food including dogs, beef and pizza. Krystin the bar tender was amazing and service was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sunday was my first time at brandos! My whole family are Chicago fans and have talked about this place many times! It lived up to the talk! Great service, food, drinks and atmosphere! Will be spending many Sunday's watching football there this year!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best off the beaten path locals bar. They treat you like family and pour the drinks the same way! Tommy is man, best bartender period. Nunzio has great skills in the kitchen. Going here after our before the clubs grabbing a pizza is a perfect night."}
{"text":"If you like Chicago sports, this is your place. Nick, the owner seems to be there 24/7. Incredible Chicago hot dogs and Italian beef. Good Chicago pizza. Of course, Bears, Blackhawks and Cubs game on the big screens all over the bar. The bartenders and servers are outstanding!! Nick added draft beers a while back, including some Goose Island 312 (draft and bottles)."}
{"text":"If you are a Chicago sports fan this is the place to be. Staff was very friendly & attentive..sat outside with no one else but we were never forgotten. Got a deep dish pizza and I must say it was pretty good. Originally from the Chicago area that means a lot!!"}
{"text":"Not Chicago style at all, pizza was more like thin crust. I would have given more stars if there was any sort of service. Very disappointing to an Illinois -Vegas transplant :("}
{"text":"If you're a Chicago fan and looking for a bar to go to...Brando's is definitely the bar for you! From the decor, to the food...it has Chicago written all over it. Definitely felt Chicago vibes when we entered. I would give the decor and service 5 stars. Service was great and our server was very attentive. However, I would give 3.5 for the food and drinks. This was our first time here and we got the thin crust pizza and fries. Prices were fair. The pizza was kind of greasy, but it was still good. Beer menu was pretty limited and our beer from the tap was flat. However, I do want to go back to try to deep dish pizza.  If you want to go catch a game, chat with Chicagoans, this is definitely the place for you!"}
{"text":"The food and people here are amazing! I was referred to this place by a friend, and make it a point to always stop by when I'm in town. The regulars welcome everyone and make you feel part of \"the family.\" I highly recommend The deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Great Chicago bar. Good pizza & great place for a Cubs or Blackhawks game."}
{"text":"My best friend is from Chicago, so yeah, we were looking for a Chicago bar to watch Blackhawks games. All 82,000 of them.   This place is easy to get to, friendly, has a great bar and menu, and of course ALWAYS has the Chicago game on, no matter what the sport. The service can get nuts during games, but it's always good and friendly. The seating can be a bit tough on the back, but it's a bar, and you're there to watch the game with the crowd.   The food is good. Sausage & peppers, amazing. Pizza can be hit or miss. We've tried the deep dish a bunch of times, and considering this is what Chicago is known for, it's been disappointing. A couple of times it wasn't even cooked all the way through. The toppings are pretty sparse and not spread out evenly. The pizza itself has been inconsistent. We got to a point where we weren't even ordering the pizza...Really? How does that happen?   So...Great atmosphere, plenty of parking, easy to find (right off the 15), great staff, great menu, and good food,  but only okay pizza."}
{"text":"Food was OK, but this is a smoky local hole in the wall.  Service is a little bit rough but it's a place filled with no character other than the smoke stains on the wall."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best pizza I've ever had.  Service was outstanding, great atmosphere, I will definitely be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Great place! Friendly people. Love the atmosphere. Love the deep dish pizza!!!! Definitely my new hangout!"}
{"text":"I literally haven't been here in 10 years, they did change a lot of things I was disappointed they don't have the meatballs and garlic pizza anymore, but I got a pepperoni sausage pizza and some hot wings. let me tell you the hot wings were amazing pizza was great services really good their fries were the exact same as red Robin but way better nice and crispy. nice place to come to if you want that down home Chicago hometown bar. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars for this sports bar!  The staff and owners are accommodating and friendly. The vibes are pleasant and lively. Everyone is very welcoming, whether you root for Chicago or not; it's the Perfect place to catch a game, have some drinks and grab an affordable meal with friends. I'd happily recommend Brando's to any local or transient needing a great place to kick-back and enjoy themselves.  Sidenotes: *you can't go wrong with the pizza *the many big screen TVs allow you to catch any game you so desire"}
{"text":"Brando's is a REAL Chicago style sports bar with memorabilia from all of the Chicago sports teams from posters, to banners to Fat Heads of famous Chicago pro players. It also has great food. They also have fresh Chicago style pizza. I had fish and chips and the Philly cheese steak which were both delicious.  They have great prices on there food items as well.  If you want to feel like you are in a bar in Chicago especially during a game."}
{"text":"Brando's  is taking it to a new level! After adding additional seating in the bar area and pub style tables on the patio... (just in time for CUBS Playoffs) they've also tuned all Playoff events into NO Smoking. Today I had the privilege of meeting...are you ready for it...Brando's very own CHEF TIRVO!  Very excited to have my Chicago \"Neighborhood Bar\" stepping it up for our community.  Thanks Rocky, Anthony, Nick and General Manager Sean. We so appreciate it"}
{"text":"Customer service - amazing!  Drinks - delicious! Margarita was on point!  Food - seriously some of the best food I've ever had! Deep dish pizza for the win!   Overall, great atmosphere, great staff and great food. Can't ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"Brando's for Chicago sports - Cubbies, Sox, Blackhawks and Bears!  The absolute best bartenders, chefs and the owners are also rock stars!  I have never had a better deep dish or Chicago dog.  Absolutely phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. The place was 1/4 full. Asked waitress what was the best meal on the menu or the most popular. She said pizza was the best. I asked what was the next best besides pizza. She said the Italian beef sandwich. I ordered the Italian beef and my friend ordered a small Pizza. The small pizza was fair to good and my Italian beef was dry and tasteless. When the waitress came to drop off the bill she asked how everything was.   We said pizza was good but the Italian beef was not so good.  She smirked and walked away. The place seemed to have only a few locals and no one was friendly and food was fair at best."}
{"text":"brando's is the bomb come and enjoy pizza, beer , and great times!!!  im a patriot, red soxs, bruins fan and they always accomodate my teams;)- i love brandos!!!"}
{"text":"One of the brothers that own this place is a real asshole! I have been living here in LV for 13 years now. Last night was my first in his establishment. I ordered a pitcher of beer. Waitress never came back for her money for two hrs. Finally, another server came by had she said \"oh I can take your check and money for this bill. I questioned her she said \"oh we will get it worked out.\" Finally my original server came by and wanted to be paid. I stated to her I had already paid the $ 17.00 bill with another server. I have her a twenty dollar bill.  Now nobody remembers getting paid. I go into bar and tell Nick, the problem he gets defensive and acts like I should pay again. I told him he's incompetent. He has literally no control over his staff. I told him this is total bullshit. I've been a Cub fan 48 years and this owner can't get it right for a pitcher of beer that didn't cost him over.08 cents an ounce about $5.00. Then he tells me \"not to come back.\" Fuck this asshole.... I won't ever patronize Brando's Sportsbar again. The owner is a total asswipe!!!"}
{"text":"Great Bar Been going on and off for years now with my girls for hockey. Best Hawks Bar In Vegas"}
{"text":"Food looked insanely good.  They had great dining options extremely late.  Too bad I never got to try any of it since we waited for 1.5 hrs and nothing came."}
{"text":"In a word.Awesome! I was looking for a Chicago bar to watch my Blackhawks and yelp found Brando's and I found my new family! I've never felt so welcome before. From the time a walked thru the doors. From the Bartenders , especially Megan and my Waitress Heather and owners who are hands on. Make you feel like part of the family . And I can't forget about the food! Chicago style pizza to sliced beef, served wet or dry. You can't go wrong! Great prices and service bring me back every time. I found Chicago in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Brando's you remind me of my windy city home. I have read reviews and they are all over the place for Brando's so let's rate it on two separate items: food and atmosphere.   Food - I love it, cause it is artery clogging Chicago style food. So if that is what you are looking for I highly recommend it.   - Chicago Deep Dish: it is solid, very good, I'm not super into deep dish to begin with but a good choice if you are craving it.   - Regular Crust: my absolute favorite by far, give me sausage and black olives any day! It is the right thickness and so far has always been cooked to perfection.   - Thin Crust: has never been my thing unless it is a super fancy pizza that rocks (get my drift?), so if you like cracker thin, this is for you.   - Italian Beef: AWESOME - that is all. Lol  Good beer selection, they have 312 Wheat on tap and that is my go to.  Atmosphere - there is nothing like a Chicago bar when the Cubs (or any other Chicago team is winning). I watched almost every playoff game there and it was insane. Was it busy? Were they overwhelmed? Heck yes - but everyone was so friendly and the staff was always busting their butts to serve people and that is what matters.   I have yet to be back (except for take out), I am really looking forward to their Sweet 16 party this month to go when we are not all screaming and high fiving!"}
{"text":"Great Friendly atmosphere ,Food hot and served in a timely manner. Chicago Bar but no matter WHAT team your cheering for the energy is amazing and makes this place fun for food and sports"}
{"text":"Great sports bar. The owner and the bartenders are great people and create a great environment. This is a great place to watch a game, hang out and have some brews. It is what a sports bar should be.   They do not have draft beer, which is a shame, but the selection of bottles is great and they do good deals during sporting events. The pizza is the star of the menu, but the sandwiches I've had there have always hit the spot."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by Brando's Sportsbar during the Cub's playoffs. I'm so glad we did! Being from Chicago it felt just like home. The staff was super friendly, always made sure our beers were full and our food was out quickly. Brando's deep dish pizza (especially the sausage) is to die for and it tastes just like home. My friends and I continue to stop in because of the good service, the fun atmosphere and the great food! Even if you aren't a former Chicagoan you will love this place. I would definitely recommend this bar to everyone and anyone who wants good food, service and to meet great people."}
{"text":"They need to clean their salt shakers!!! When I picked up the salt shaker I could feel the grease and dirt on my fingers. I was disgusted to see how filthy it was!   I moved from the Chicago area to Las Vegas and was excited to find Brando's but  \"YUCK\" 1st and last time, will not be going there again!  This is not even close to Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. The deep dish pizza is a thin crust lining a deep dish pan with cheese and way TOO much tomatoes! think I scraped off about a cup of tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at this bar, our server was great she was very helpful and made sure we had all we needed if I recall correctly her name was Megan. Great food as well deep dish pizza Chicago style was hot and made fresh. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Me & my husband walked into Brando's after passing it up over and over going to other nearby establishments... We're not big into football, we kinda avoid those team bars.... Anyways, we decided to try them out since I didn't feel like driving any further in this August heat... My first impression as we walk in is noticing how small the place is. Enough room for the bar and maybe 10 tables. The menu looked pretty lackluster, so much that I almost anticipated just playing a few bucks then leaving to find lunch elsewhere... But we ended up staying... I just ordered the typical [hot] chicken tenders with fries... I expected the chicken to be those thin, crappy frozen tenders... Well when food finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised! Piping hot fries, yummy ranch, and that chicken was great! Not what I thought it would be at all. And the hot sauce was very tasty. Overall, the bar is basically a sports divebar, some friendly customers at the bar and unexpectedly good food even for a lackluster menu. Teetering between a 3 and 4 star review. Lets call it a 3.5 star rating lol"}
{"text":"Brandos is my absolute favorite sports bar! I live all the way in the NW area of Vegas but when I'm looking for good Chicago style food, sports, friends and fun... it's worth every mile!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, but most of all great atmosphere. I love sports bars and this is one of the best in the local Vegas area!!! Wings are amazing, by the way."}
{"text":"My 12 year search is over. I finally had a \"Chicago Beef\" in vegas that took my tastebuds home!! Bread - Right! Beef - Right!  Giardiniera - Right! Gravy.. (yeah, we call it gravy though you might call it au jus.) right.   Hands down, for me, the best Beef in town."}
{"text":"Authentic Chicago food - pizza, Vienna beef hot dogs, Italian beef with normal hot giardiniera (not the pickled vegetables they sell in the stores here).  Chicago sports - the best place for Blackhawks.  Sweet outdoor patio with bags games.  Owners are cool as hell, always around to say hello.  Lots of overflow parking."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for 16.00 that was worse than frozen one from the grocery store. Ordered a 10.00 chicken ceasar salad and the chicken was absolutely disgusting. Such a waste."}
{"text":"Top notch. Good food. Cold beers. Went there after work and had a good time. Ask for Bernice she's the best!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot to watch the game on a Sunday evening, went in and had an awesome meal with my family. Highly suggest this spot if your looking for a dam good Chicago dog or Roast Beef dip. Gonna try the Deep dish next time I'm in town. The staff was on it and very friendly. It was a pleasure meeting Nick to. What a nice guy.  LGLG"}
{"text":"Some old friends of mine were visiting Las Vegas and they are die hard Blackhawks fans.  They said they were going here to watch the game, so I decided that I would meet them there.  I was surprised to see it was an all Chicago Sports Bar.  Sox,Cubs, Bulls, and of course Hawks.    The bar was clean and had a friendly atmosphere not like what you would experience in Chicago itself.  I was starving so I was going with something I know very well...Italian Beef Sandwich with Hot Giardinara and wet. The sandwich and fries came out hot and fresh. The bread was good and the meat thinly sliced and most importantly on an italian beef is that it was seasoned perfectly.   The \"Hot Stuff\" was awesome. The fries were a thick steak cut and also were cooked and seasoned well.  The sandwiches was one of the best I have had and I am giving them four stars for the food.  The Pizzas looked awesome as well, thick and delicious Deep Dish Pizza Chicago Style.  This will have to be ordered next time.   I was not impressed with the beer selection though, I give them 3 stars for the beer.  They did have a few Chicago Brews like 312 on tap but then it was all your typical Bud, Lite, and PBR.  I think they can work on getting some better brews but I am sure they cater to the crowd they enjoy serving.   Recap Great Food, Need more beer choices, cough cough. It is a little smokey."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here very often! Great food, friendly employees and fun environment!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten her, but it will always hold a special place in my heart. This is where my now wife and I had our 1st date. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're a fan of any Chicago sports teams. The food isn't bad, either. I'm from New York so I'm a little biased when it comes to pizza, but the last two times I've been here, I've been satisfied with the pies. I'm eager to try the dogs. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"The bf and I are on a mission to find establishments in LV that have table shuffleboard and then tour the city going to each one and Brando's was our first stop.  I found the place to be laid back, it wasn't at all gimmicky, and everyone seemed to be enjoying food, music, beer, TV, or a smoke and most importantly- each others company. We ordered a few beers- nothing you couldn't pick up at the liquor store. Staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered a pizza-which was pretty darn tasty. We played shuffleboard which was 2$ for 15 minutes of game time. There is a large covered patio to sit outside which would be nice for large crowds."}
{"text":"Went on a MNF adventure.  It was Bears/Packers.  Packed house.  $2 drafts and $2 hot dogs.  Not bad but the patio was a bit cold.  I hear they have good pizza."}
{"text":"I have been going here regularly for years. I never left a review because I just assumed they had five stars. Stumbled upon them on Yelp when I decided to drop a few reviews and was shocked to see 3 1/2 stars.   Every member of their staff is awesome. I honestly feel more welcomed there than at any other bar in Vegas. Their commitment to making you as comfortable as possible despite the hordes of fans that pile in there is absolutely amazing. I have literally had a waitress see me walk in, grab me, make a makeshift table to seat me and my group, chat for a few minutes to catch up, and then hustle harder than some of the players in the game we're watching to do the same for every other customer there.   Now, I'll be perfectly honest. If you want to have a nice quite place to grab a beer on a Sunday during a Bears game or during the Stanley Cup Playoffs, this is not the place. But that really isn't what Brando's is about.  If you like anything Chicago related, this is your spot. Hands down. If you want the best Deep Dish in Las Vegas, this is your spot. If you want Deep Dish with out a bunch of Chicago Fans jumping up and down or screaming over first downs, then come on a Saturday when the Hawks aren't playing, haha.  6/5 stars without a doubt."}
{"text":"Such a great local bar, I always come here when I am in town and recommend this place to anyone. Not only is it s great place to watch all the Chicago sports but the food is AMAZING. Hands down my favorite place to get pizza. Must try the deep dish, you will be hooked. Deff a step up from your local neighborhood bar. Wings, beer, pizzas, sandwiches they have it all. Stop by, you will thank me."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Vegas for a meeting, I had.  I was craving Chicago style pizza, and as luck would have it, after my meetings, we went to red Rock Canyon, to get out of the city, and just so happened to drive by this place, on our way back.  I yelp searched it, and almost all reviews were 4 or 5 stars.  They deserve that, at the very least.    We had the 12\" Chicago style pizza, with ham pepperoni and sausage.  It was great.    If you're looking for a great place to eat, off the tourist areas, and with local, down to earth folks, come here.   Andy"}
{"text":"Gets two stars because bartender is nice. No jameson Irish whiskey and poorest selection of wine. Simply put mgmt doesn't care. Games are ok....money is better spent elsewhere as much as I hate to say it."}
{"text":"Not bad place to hang out.  Close to Silverton and freeway"}
{"text":"Went to watch game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals. Got there 2 1/2 hours early and very chair was turned over and reserved. There were only 5 people in the place. We said something about it to the bartender and he said what do you want me to do? Sorry. Never going here again. Even though I miss chicago, this place does not remi d me of home. Home is somewhere you want to be."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sports bar that's dedicated to Chicago and its teams, this is definitely the place to go! The inside is dark and small and it's like a throwback to the 90s when people smoked in restaurants.   I called in for a carry out. I got the deep dish with sausage which came out to be like $19. It wasn't a big size. Probably could serve like three people.   Honestly, I was expecting a really cheesy deep dish. It was deep dish but more like the crust was high and it wasn't as much cheese as I expected. It was still really good. I would recommend it to people. Even though it's not the best, it's a good introduction to deep dish for anyone who hasn't had it.  The service was great, I thought. I came in and the bartender was really nice. The girl that handled my transaction was really nice.   Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the Cubs game last week. Atmosphere was awesome, pizza was amazing, and service was great. Conrad was our bartender, he was super friendly and attentive. Prices were very reasonable. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Staff friendly. Bar is as advertised, Chicago'd out. Food, I haven't tried everything so this is based on the deep dish pizza. I would say it was good, no better no worse. I asked for light sauce and it still dominated. The pepperoni were in there somewhere, they just didn't fond their way into my mouth very often. (Or they were drowned in the sauce) I always give places a second chance, but for now Amores deep dish edges Brandos in round 1. Overall, good atmosphere, friendly place, great place to catch a game and drinks."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place!!! Ive been literally coming here for years and I've always loved everyone who is here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The deep dish pizza is amazing. Conrad is one cool cat...very personable and respectable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have amazing pizza, a super friendly staff, and big TV's for the games. I am a huge Cubs fan and this is my favorite place in Vegas for all Chicago sports!"}
{"text":"Went in on 5/14 bartender was awesome great service as we left another place.Asked if kitchen was open..And bartender made us food!!!awesome he did a great job.Brandos had goose island Greenline beer on tap oh yeah. He was friendly fast service and was on top of his job!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to a good friend of mine we discovered this place in February 2016.  We were looking for a place to watch the Blackhawks game of Super Bowl weekend and my friend some how found Brando's.    I was finally back at Brando's for the first time in year as I only get to Las Vegas for the Super Bowl.  As usual Brando's is the place to be for Chicagoans looking for a taste of home and to watch Chicago sporting events with a group.  Upon arriving once again it was awesome to see that it was a Chicago place.  My friend and I went inside and quickly found were we wanted to sit.  Ordered beverages and ordered a deep dish pizza.  Brando's also has vienna beef dogs, Italian beef, Italian sausage, combos and other things that remind you of home.  The pizza was the best on the West Coast that I have ever had that claim to be true authentic Chicago Style Pizza.  It was quite tasty and my friend was pretty happy about it too!  The cool thing is that I felt each time I have been to Brando's that I am home even though I am on the road.  The staff is pretty cool and Nick is a great guy to get to meet and talk with.  Also met Mayor Mike and Assistant Mayor Mike on this trip who only enhanced the fun of being at Brando's!  If you travel to Vegas and need a taste of Chicago than Brando's is a must place to stop!!!  Wish I could travel to Vegas a little more yet I know I will be back at Brando's next Super Bowl weekend again!!!"}
{"text":"If your a fan of Chicago and a fan of sports Brando's is the place. They have the best pizza! I don't eat pizza to often but when it arrived, piping hot and smelling so delicious I couldn't say no. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Their big ol fatty French frys were also on point. I smothered them in ketchup and they were super yummy.  I highly recommend Brando's and I will defiantly be back for more."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place by accident and was pleasantly surprised. Good pub food, pizza and wings were both great, as was the service.  If you're a Chicago sports fan, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"If you are from Illinois or Illinois sports fan you will love this bar! Great Chicago style comfort food, drinks and Decor! Go Cubs!"}
{"text":"We used to hang out here all the time and it was a fun place to go. We stopped coming because of a certain situation but decided to go back after a couple years.. wow what a change.. service was horrible..  I guess if you're not a regular they don't give a shit..it sucks cause we love the family that owns the place.  Miss the old crew :("}
{"text":"New to the area and went for beer and pizza based on the good reviews. Once we went inside we immediately decided to take the pizza to go. It is so dark and dreary in there you can barely see. After ordering the pizza we decided to get some beer while we wait. Nothing on tap, but a few craft selections in bottles. We saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8 which is a killer deal. We got Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and cracked one open. It had gone bad. We asked to change it out for Alaskan Amber. That had gone bad too. We ended up throwing the 6 pack away, which I don't do. The pizza was not square as they boast but round. And it looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on their website. Small and scarce pepperoni with a cracker thin crust. Tasted like the pizza you get at an arcade or a bowling alley. My guess is it was frozen. We would have been better off getting a freezer pizza and 6 pack from Albertsons across the street. And it would have been a lot cheaper. $26 of junk we through out. We would never go back."}
{"text":"This was the second time here, specifically to order the pizza again. We ordered extra thin crust cheese pizza with green pepper, olive, and onions. (Same as the first visit) SO GOOD!!! I typically HATE thin crust pizza, but this place is literally the only exception. Pricey, but I'm more than happy to pay a little extra for quality and taste!! I want to try the deep dish when I have more time to wait."}
{"text":"I came to LV on Memorial day weekend for a softball tournament. Of course there was a Blackhawks playoff game that Saturday. I'm not going to miss the game am I??  So I fired up old trusty Yelp and found this place. Full of the awesome Chicago decor to get you pumped up for the game.  My server was awesome at her job. Even though the place was slammed packed, she didn't miss a beat helping me get my Italian beef and several rounds of Old Style. (Yeah yeah, I drink Old Style. What about it??) Even the people there are nice. This couple let me share their table so I can have a place to sit and eat. Good people.  Overall, good atmosphere, good help, and good food. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Well, they say 1st impressions are everything. Well, I'm not so impressed. This being my first time, the food was so so. I understand it can't be like Home, but, it could have been a little closer than it was. Will probably stick with Windy City Beefs and Pizza as it is way better than here!!!! But, the atmosphere is fun!!!!! And, it's close to home..."}
{"text":"Long wait time... Deliciously worth it! We ordered the Chicago style deep dish pizza with just pepperoni on it. After about 45 minutes and 2 weak vodka tonics our pizza arrived. It was extremely cheesy and had a ton of great sauce on it. I could only eat two slices so I was happy to take the rest home for work tomorrow. I have less stars because the service wasn't the best. Took forever to just order our drinks and food, so on top of the 45 minutes we waited for our pizza to cook; we also waited 15 minutes for a server. There were only 6 people in the whole place besides us."}
{"text":"I have no idea how people rate this any more than two stars. The food was horrible and it's nothing more than a dive bar"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrendous. I was served someone else's half eaten pizza when told they made a mistake. Instead of rushing a second one I sat for another 2 hours. That is absolutely unacceptable and being reported to the health department. And to not do anything to remedy the issue is bullshit as well. Last dime myself and group will spend here. It's a shame. We liked this place. There is no excuse for that and then not even try to fix it makes it even worse."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little bar! Sean was great! Customer service on point! thanks Sean! See ya next time!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the very first Brando's on Blue Diamond Road almost 10 years ago. I've also been to the restaurant on Sunset/ Green Valley. On a recent trip back to Las Vegas I visited Brando's and WOW is it ever better than I remember! The atmosphere is always inviting, definitely a local feel but such a great change from the madness of restaurants on the Strip. The staff always welcomes you and makes you feel right at home. I chose Brando's to watch some NFL playoff games and they have so many TV's and the sound is LOUD which I love. I'd totally watch the Superbowl there. The best part is their PIZZA. Chicago style, they even have authentic deep dish. Fresh toppings and REAL mushrooms, not those fake one's most places use. Also the best Philly Cheese steak sandwich!  My drink was never empty and the beer was ice cold!  If you use the gaming machines, you drink for free too. I LOVE this place. WAY better than any chain joint I've found in Vegas. A must see!"}
{"text":"Chicago themed sports bar off of Blue Diamond near Interstate 15.  This bar definitely caters to fans of all Chicago sports....football, baseball, hockey, etc.  Seating at the bar has video poker or you can sit at a table.  The food menu has the usual pub grub including pizza. We tried the Chicago deep dish pizza. I've had Chicago deep dish pizza in Chicago before and Brando's pizza is right up there with it. You will definitely want to split this pizza with someone.  Quick service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a Chicago style deep dish pizza. When I saw Brando's down the street from my house I knew I had to try it out. It took me almost a year before I finally tried my first Chicago style deep dish pizza and it was pretty underwhelming.   The reviews on here definitely got my hopes up!  I thought it was gonna be filled to the brim and it wasn't. It had very little pepperoni on it. The pizza sauce was mostly diced tomatoes (more tomatoes than sauce).   All in all theres a bunch of other places that serve better pizza by far. The pizza was good but far from great."}
{"text":"Went to Brando's for the first time a few weeks ago.  Recently moved to Vegas from Chicago so was not expecting too much.  But I have to say, their deep dish pizza was really good - cheese was delicious and the crust was nice and crunchy.  Not exactly like Chicago, but pretty close.  Looking forward to trying their thin crust pizza, too."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and Chicago Style Hot Dogs, plus insanely good curly fries.  Good selection of beers and playable video poker.  Cool Chicago themed decor.  We both liked this place and will be back.  For anyone thinking this place is too dark...really?!?!  It's a sports bar with video poker.  We found the lighting perfect."}
{"text":"Great Chicago sports bar, especially for Blackhawks games.  Main downside was the smokey environment.  Being non-smokers this will most likely cause us not to come back.  Food was okay."}
{"text":"I'm a Packers fan, but for a Bears bar their great. Anthony and his brother make you feel at home. And the food is excellent! Try their Chicago style pizza!"}
{"text":"Their deep dish pizza is crazy good!  I would highly recommend it.  Being Las Vegas, I would assume it's hard to find a good deep dish.  The staff is friendly.  If you're a Chicago sports fan of any kind, then this is the place to be for a game."}
{"text":"Cubs win! Cubs win! Cubs win!  This was an incredible time watching the Cubs break a 108 year old curse in dramatic fashion. Great people, staff and owner.   Seriously good Italian beef sandwiches to boot. Best I've had outside Chitown."}
{"text":"So here's my take on this place...  I came during the week, party of 2, ordered some wings and a pizza. We were totally okay with the fact that the pizza could take about 45 minutes, because it is the original Chicago deep dish style. In good company, phones aside, wings coming our way, and funny conversation made the wait totally worth it.   The toppings were pepperoni, sausage & bacon. The only thing that we questioned was the sausage. It literally looked just like breakfast sausage and was cut in half and shoved on the pizza. Totally not what I was expecting when it came to sausage on a pizza. I usually expect little sausage crumbles or sausage 'balls'. This was literally like a breakfast sausage sliced in half or something. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was delish!! It was the first time I had deep dish since I was a wee-wee-soccer-playin' kid! I originally had planned to go to Giordano's, however I had to get my daughter from school and knew that driving to the strip along with the 45-60 min wait for my order would make things a tight squeeze in my scheduled plans. Sooo, we took a trip to this local joint because it was closer and we knew we would have the time we needed for our prior obligations!  The pizza was delicious, but I think the appetizers filled us up, as I only chowed down 2 slices, compared to my usual 3 or 4 MAYBE THE WHOLE PIZZA. ;)   The food was good, and leftovers made the kids happy, so that's a good reason to come back!"}
{"text":"When you're at half time...shift change...bartender decides to change sound to another game, really?? Respect dude.  #notcool  It's not like this place is packing them in. Get a clue."}
{"text":"Went with friends to watch hockey. It was UNBELIEVABLY hot in there. We asked over and over again and the poor waitress said the owner would not turn the air down below 85. We ordered pizza and over an hour later the server showed up and said they hadn't started it yet and it would be at least another hour.  The place has TWO pizza ovens!! She said a salad would be over an hour. The staff looked like they were ready to pass out. The owner is obviously too frugal for his own good. Break out the wall....add some pizza ovens and turn on the air!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Im reviewing based on the pizza and prices alone. I do not like sports or sports bars, so I do not dine in. My husband goes here to watch games a lot tho, and he loves the atmosphere as well as the food. He brings me home thin crust pizza sometimes, and it is good quality pizza.  Sauce has great flavor, crust is good.  Not stingy with the toppings either! Very reasonably priced for a mom n pop pizza.  I wouldnt go out of my way for it (like my hubby does, lol) but im always excited when he brings me some, yum!"}
{"text":"If you're from Chicago and feeling homesick or even just craving that good ol' midwestern vibe, this is the place you want to be. The staff is awesome, the food is great, and there is no better place in Vegas to go when you want to support our Chicago teams.   It's nice to have a place to go to that feels like home! We love Brandos!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for somewhere to watch a game on tv... Keep looking. Walked in & right back out.. Very smokey, nothing special, & prices weren't worth toughing it out for."}
{"text":"I went to a few \"Chicago\" bars before finding Brando's.... and thank god I did! I have been going here for years now. If you are a Chicago fan, there is absolutely nowhere else you should be going to watch the games.  The atmosphere is amazing.  When we score, everyone high-fives and cheers.  It is literally like watching the games with a bar full of your buddies.   The food is fantastic - I have never had a bad dish.  My favorite is the Brando's Wrap... delicious! The staff is awesome too.  Sean and Conrad are so good at their jobs; quick, friendly, and always down for some good bantering.  No matter how packed the place can get, they still give the same great service as when there are only a few of us there.    I can't say enough great things about this place.  Obviously, one of my favorite spots to hang out!"}
{"text":"If you're a Chicagoan, this is the bar for you. There was plenty of Chicago decor, the Wgn720 painted on the outside of the bar with Chicago sports logos. I had the thin crust pizza.. It was very greasy but still good. The service was ok and the price was fine. If you want to watch a game, play some video poker and have a drink, this is a nice stop to socialize with other Chicagoans."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Last time I was here it was when the Cubs were in the WS.  This place was crazy packed and they still managed to have great service and great food.   Now we are back for Cubs spring training in Vegas and the Blackhawks.  They also have Goose Island here."}
{"text":"I am an EAGLES fan. This is a BEARS bar. I took my nephew here so he could enjoy a Vegas team bar experience (He is a BEARS fan) This bar is very quaint. I have seen this bar in my drives on blue diamond and have always heard of the great food.  So it's game day and we decide to check this little place out. The staff is amazing and the crowd was awesome.  We arrives early and got a plate of wings. These wings were perfectly fried and had a spicey follow through. There were so many we never did finish them all. Beer specials were good and again staff was awesome. I really want to go and eat some pizza here it looked incredible.  Go here especially if you are a bears fan."}
{"text":"Brando's reminds me of your typical neighborhood beer and shot bar.  These types of places used to line the streets of Chicago in the 50's-60's-70's-80's.  What makes it better is that it is a CHICAGO BAR.  This place is a great hangout to watch all your Chicago Sports.  Any given Sunday you are most likely sitting next to someone that grew up on the North Side.  So the ambiance gets an A+.  The service is very above average as well.  Always staffed accordingly and for the most part everyone is attentive to your needs during busy game days.  Sometimes when it is packed standing room only, you may need to show some patience.  The food is a great combination of Chicago favorites and bar staples.  Deep dish pizza, Italian beef and Chicago dogs are all fantastic.  And for you Chicagoans that miss a good ole fashioned beer garden, you are in luck!  Equipped with TV's for when it's busy on Sundays.  Brandos is a great bar.  The only thing that keeps me from giving five stars is that most of the menu is very average.  Nothing to brag about.  The Chicago items are great.  The smoke can also be a bit much during busy times and it can get hot inside the low ceiling bar in the summer.  This bar also sells domestic six packs to go like most Chicago Bars!"}
{"text":"I went into Brando's after noticing the logos of all the Chicago sports teams painted on to the building.  I have been looking for a good place to watch my bears, since I moved here.  My girlfriend suggested we check it out for a monday night football game.  They offer chicago style pizza, which I had to try.  To clear some confusion... Chicago style pizza is NOT deep dish. We do love that in chicago, but Chi Style refers to the way that it is cut. In squares.  Brando's sign says Home of the Square Pizza. It isnt referring to the shape of the pie, but the cut.  anyway, the pizza was awesome.  The sauce was perfect, great crispy crust.  Got a bucket of domestics for 12 bucks, and had really quick attentive service. The bartender/server made an effort to learn our names.    The only downside is that it was REALLY smoky, and for some reason there were children in there. People that bring their kids to a smoky bar suck, and I am gonna use the f word a lot on purpose if you bring them near me."}
{"text":"We were lured in by the excellent food reviews. We ordered the deep dish pizza for takeout and were not disappointed. The box weighed a ton! The staff were friendly. The atmosphere was non rowdy for a Tavern, but rather laid back and comfortable. I don't know why I expected it to be rowdy. Lol. We got the order pretty quick and rushed home to devour this monster of a pie. The Chicago style pizza was delicious! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Attempted to watch blackhawks game here. Walked out 5 mins before game started. No good beer and food specials.. PBR and 312. Gross    At least get busch light  . Also had creepy people sitting at the bar who may as well have taken a picture , itd last longer.  One good thing was that the tvs are up close to the bar so you can see it clear"}
{"text":"Tony the grave bartender is amazing!! Tony I knows your drinks!! He is amazing come check him out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, nothing special but decent.  We had a Chicken Philly Sandwich and Medium Chicken Wings.  Both were well done and we have no complaints.  The 'steak fries' were lifeless and boring. The soft drink machine has the carbonation set too low so the RC cola tastes flat.   Our waitress was brand new and did an ok job. There were very slow when we were there so it is hard to gauge the real service."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  Went tonite for the 1st time. Waitress was great, food server was great. Checked in with us often but not overbearing.  I ordered the swiss and mushroom burger medium well, and that's how it was delivered to me.  V had a burger with avocado and cheese, also prepared as ordered.  Waffle fries were excellent too.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I am NOT from my Chicago. My fiancé lived there for almost a year, but he's a Bears and Cubs fan, thus, making me a Cubs fan.  Anyways, we decided yesterday we wanted to watch Game 2 of the Cubs and Dodgers, but we didn't want to watch it alone. We wanted to watch it with fellow Cubs fans, DUH!   Yelp didn't disappoint.  Our searches led us to this bar and we couldn't be more happier! Immediately upon pulling into the parking lot, we saw the Cubs logo on the front. We walked into the bar and instantly saw a good amount of people in Cubs gear and Chicago sports team decoration EVERYWHERE. It was pretty awesome.  Most of the tables were taken, but we found a good spot in the middle of the bar. The whole bar has TVs everywhere playing the game, so you really can't miss anything from sitting anywhere here.  This place also has Chicago deep dish pizza! I didn't want to eat super heavy that night tho so we went for the buffalo chicken sliders and steak fries. Our waiter was pretty awesome. I wish I caught his name, but he made sure we were taken care of.  We are definitely coming back here tomorrow to watch Game 3."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been coming here since 85'.It's definitely a local get away hangout spot. The bartender Julie was very helpful and knows customer service. The Pizza she served us was the deep dish and all the toppings were under the sauce, everything was under the sauce. I hate to give away their secret but the concept of this pizza is very tasty. Thank-you Brando's!"}
{"text":"Wandered in looking for a new local bar to enjoy some drinks and food. Lets start with the nice... the deep dish pizza was ok.  Now for the bad. The bartender was a rude unfriendly ass. He was only interested in some homely looking chick at the end of the bar, god forbid we asked for a drink. when i paid the check he just about threw the change at me. What a douche. Oh well guess i will eventually find a bar that i can enjoy. Caise this is NOT THE PLACE."}
{"text":"Long overdue for dining again on comfort food at Brando's, Diane and I returned there on the way back from California, after a 3-year absence.  The place appeared quite the same as before, with several large flat screen televisions spread around, and a thematic emphasis on all Chicago professional sports teams.  We took seats at a cluster of small dining tables on one side of the building, not far from the long bar, and then perused the menu, which has changed some but not much.  Overhead, as they passed through, fan blades kept periodically covering up a ceiling light, which caused a somewhat unpleasant strobe effect on our table top.  And, where we were seated, a few voices carried really loudly from customers standing just behind the adjacent bar.  Our table had a rather dirty top, but our bartender-server noticed and quickly cleaned it before our orders arrived.  Diane opted for a Cheeseburger, which came definitely medium rare as ordered, with a lot of pink showing.  And the cheese draping over the meat was nicely melted.  For my late dinner I selected a Chicago Dog and a BLT, which came with tasty French Fries.  While the fries here were previously thin, these were elongated and somewhat thick.  They were soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  The Chicago Dog was authentic and quite good, with Sport Peppers, tomato wedges, onions, and nice emerald green relish with a fairly long dog nestled in a bun that was studded with poppy seeds.  It took me awhile to realize that no mustard was spread on the hot dog.  But suitable yellow mustard was on the table, which I quickly spread along the remaining wiener and bun.    The BLT on lightly toasted Sourdough, with lettuce and a touch of mayo, was top heavy with sliced tomatoes and rather bready.  While the bacon inside was good and tasty, the flavor barely came through.  Our server, Sean, was attentive, friendly, and solicitous of our needs,  The food here is good, if one happens to be in the area.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to travel crosstown just to eat here."}
{"text":"Hmm, its called Brandos and has nothing to do with Marlon Brando?  Walking in and making that realization we should have left but the on-line menu had an amazing picture of Onion Rings and a good looking photo of a philly cheese steak so we took a seat based on that and the Chicago sports memorabilia hung up around the bar.  It didn't take long for me to notice they dont have draft beer only bottles. If your business is stuck serving bottles you should at least go out of your way to serve hard to find brands and not stuff you can pick up at a local grocery store. I only saw one brand I didn't recognize and was highly disappointed. I know Tenaya creek would be happy to sell you some kegs and get some additional exposure on this side of the valley.  The online menu lies! They dont serve onion rings anymore. The pictures of the Philly sub are miss leading to say the least. The sub I was served was lacking in both size (maybe half the size of the one in the picture)and definitely was lacking in flavor.   The wings we shared weren't spicy and had an over the top Vinegar taste. Ive said it before and I will say it again Vinegar isnt a good spice on hot/spicy chicken wings.    The chef salad we ordered had a single slice of very thin lunch meat slice ham. About 100 black olives a single slice of tomato and maybe a Kraft single slice of cheese. It was pretty sad looking.  The waitress was nice, answered questions quickly and was tentative without being pushy or intrusive. She even gave us a free order of fries when she realized I had ordered the waffle fries and was served the regular fries.  Oh I almost forgot! Its a bar serving beer and alcohol but they only have a single toilet in the mens bathroom?! In fact that toilet was the size of a potty training toilet and I cant believe it can hold up to a busy night of swigging bottles.  I wish I could recommend something good on the menu or even say something good about the bar but the only positive thing out of this meal was my GF won $70 bucks on the slot machine during our lunch and we pretty much ate here for free.   If you live near by it might not be too bad to swing in for a quick beer before going elsewhere for better beer section and food quality. ITS A DIVE BAR SO DONT EXPECT THE Ritz"}
{"text":"Love this place! ARE YOU FROM CHICAGO this is your jam! The bartenders are amazing and staff great. They have the best bar food on blue diamond and the pizza is completely the BOMB!!! Huge TVs and all of your most favorite Chicago games ever!!! Great hole of a bar and you will have a super fun time!"}
