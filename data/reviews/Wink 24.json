{"text":"Loved this place!!! The food was amazing. We got the beets and zucchini appetizers, a pizza, meatball panini, and the tiramisu. Every bite of each item was so fresh and flavorful. I love this place and already can't wait to go back. The owner is a sweetheart too. So committed to the cuisine and concerned about making sure her customers are happy. Happily recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time visiting this little gem hidden in the Biltmore Fashion Park, but I know we'll be back soon! Excellent happy hour specials, the pizzas and paninis are a must try. Our server Isaac was full of energy and helped us pick the perfect wine to pair with our dinner! Newly opened place but already one of my favorites in the area.i"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix. The owner is always around and you can tell she that she not only cares about her restaurant but also the experience of the customer. Will definitely come again and again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the amazing Margherita pizza. Brie and prosciutto crostini  and homemade limoncello. A must try...you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The crostini and other appetizers were outstanding, as were the pizzas. And the service, even better! Very friendly. Two families went with 6 kids total - ages 8-10. They sat at a separate table and the staff took care of them wonderfully.   The owner came out to ask us about the meal and service. Nice gesture."}
{"text":"Fantastic blend of Italiano roots with yummy Mexican flava flav on top. Go there!! This is the best place in AZ and made my entire trip. Love it woot woot!!"}
{"text":"This place has become my new local restaurant obsession. The food is fantastic and the service is impeccable. David, behind the bar is always on point. David is always creating fantastic new drinks. Jamie is a fantastic server and Fernanda always makes sure her guest are well taken care of. I would highly recommend going in and having this same experience I have at least once a week."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service relaxed atmosphere. Live band on Friday nights. Will return."}
{"text":"We have been to this establishment twice in 1 week, very attentive servers and bartenders! Great service and great food! Cool eclectic bar restaurant in the Biltmore group!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst pizza I have ever had. If I wasn't starving I would have sent it back and went somewhere else.   As you can see from the pictures, the pizza was completely soggy. There was even a watery substance dripping off of it.   Our server never asked how the food was once it came out.   And not to mention they have the worst to-go boxes ever for pizza.  Do not waste your time going to Wink. You are better off buying a $5 frozen pizza from the gas station."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the Biltmore and decided to try.... Glad I did! It was a cool atmosphere with some great food. Really liked the fried zucchini :) not too many people do these right! Will go again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now. I frequent the area a lot and pass by this place always noticing the neon green tables & chairs outside and decor inside. At this particular time we walked in about 3 minutes until 6pm which is the end of happy hour, but our server still let us order from the happy hour menu which I believe offers half off regular menu. Ordered the calamari ($6), fried zucchini ($6), carnita tacos ($7), and a pitcher of beer ($9) all totaling to about $30! Everything was so good! Bf enjoyed his tacos (which he said was the best carnitas tacos he's ever had!) and I practically ate all the calamari and zucchini; zucchini came with a really sour yogurt dip, but it was still very good. Our server Jonathan was the best and we also enjoyed the playlist today with some reggae songs"}
{"text":"Cute decor! I used to come here when it was Forge. They have done a great job closing in the space and creating a fun atmosphere.  We ordered the La Burger. The bread this thing is served on is amazing and baked right in house. There is very little meat and cannot be cooked to order, comes cooked through. The chipotle aioli had a nice kick. Our sandwich was missing the promised arugula stated on the menu.  The side salad was nice but a touch too acidic.  The staff was friendly, but obviously still green since they had only been open a few days.   I would head back to try more things  off the menu... Or maybe just for that amazing bread!"}
{"text":"To die for pizza! Love it! Excellent  drinks and service too! Small place but great atmosphere and friendly servers!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a happy hour after doing some shopping and Wink 24 fit the bill perfectly. $5 apps and a Bellini featuring a delightful sorbet from the Gelato Spot.  The wood-fired pizzas are small, but shareable, and feature a crisp, thin crust.   Isaac, our server, was attentive, knowledgeable, and made an excellent recommendation to order the Cucumber Basil Martini. He helped to turn a delicious meal into a very enjoyable experience.   The décor is eclectic and modern, and I look forward to returning again in the near future."}
{"text":"If you are going in expecting a great pizza, there are better places.  If you are going for drinks, great service, good food, in an intimate setting with a few friends, then this may be a good spot.  For the most part, every pizza lacked seasoning/flavor except for the one with the truffle oil.  The funghi pizza was disappointing - I've had better mushroom pizza at CPK - they used small white mushrooms which lacked flavor and not enough of it.    I believe the reviews are very high for this spot because of HH, drinks, & service, and not because their pizza is amazing.  Went with 5 friends and walked away feeling that the pizza was just OK - wouldn't go out of our way to have it again or make a trip there just for the pizza."}
{"text":"Last month I hosted my Meetup groups monthly happy hour here. It was 12 of us. We took up half the restaurant. Yes, it's that small... Just an FYI!   The place was cool, the wine was good, the meatballs were not beef, definitely turkey although the server told us they were beef meatballs. The fried zucchini was scrumptious!  I can walk to Wink24 from my condo so I'll definitely try it again without a group!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the food, happy hour from 3:00 to 6:00, and the service is great. I've been going to this place for over a year and I love it. The owner, Fernanda is a beautiful lady who really cares for her customers. Josh and Marcos are great bartenders and also provide outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Finally, the Crepe Club Cart has opened on Wink's patio.  I was able to have my craving for Nutella & Strawberries satisfied.  I ordered some food from Wink too and it comes out to be really delicious, their Bianca pizza and Zucchini fritte are really worth trying. Crepe club also offers some of their savory crepes, but is limited.  The paninis, wraps or salads are not offered and not on Wink's menu."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea why this place has any bad reviews. ?  I've been coming here for over a year and the customer service is superb, they care about each and every customer. When it comes to the food YOU HAVE TO TRY THE FORMAGGI PIZZA! I added sausage to mine which I highly recommend everyone else to do. It's incredible.  Also the Bianca pizza is amazing too.  Trust me and check this place out."}
{"text":"A great casual spot! Josh is usually pouring great drinks and creates an environment where everyone is talking around the bar. It is a friendly fun local spot tucked away in a shopping center. The pizza also rocks!"}
{"text":"The service here is personal and the food is amazing. I believe this place is truly the next big thing and it deserves recognition for the wonderful quality of food & beverage selection."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Warm and friendly the meat and cheese boards are why I come and the service. It's never too crowded and very cozy, best food in Biltmore, whether you want a small snack or a meal or something in between they have it. Can't wait to try Brunch"}
{"text":"So disappointed!!!! Walked in at 9:30. People still eating and the waiter and bartender  said we are closed. I said your website says you close at 10:00. He said sorry we are closed! Here from Denver for the week, very bad business!!!!! Now at Hillstone with drinks and great dinner!"}
{"text":"Top notch, from the service to the selection to the food. Even the tunes were great! We were only there for happy hour before a concert but we will definitely return.  Make sure you try the brie and prosciutto crostini!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Reasonable happy hour prices. Good thin crust pizza. Bavarian beer on tap. Housev wine on tap not half bad. Cute out door seating.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going to Wink 24, but tonight I had a bad experience with uber eats. My order was delivered minus one item. I contacted Wink 24 and they said it was Uber's problem because the driver should have checked the bag. I attempted to reorder the item from uber eats and got a message saying Wink 24 could not complete my order.  We are good customers there and we know Fernanda, the owner. Very disappointed with them tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, Josh and David were very knowledgable and attentive . Their food and happy hour are tasty and reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing! Be bold and try this place! We had the smoke margarita pizza with pepperoni  To start. Giant salad enough to share with the table.  The featured chilie sauce is a unique blend of spice with smoke. The Manolo beef with potatoes perfection with oiled pesto. Lasagna has a special sauce a little challenging to describe. I have a picky family and we loved everything.  Management went out of her way to make the meal truly special.  She was genuinely paying attention to make sure each plate came out the way it should.   We ended with a desert of decadence- shaved chocolate. Yes. Honestly I wanted to lick the bowl.  We live in south Chandler and this place was a worth the drive."}
{"text":"Super cute place where a group of us went for lunch. The food was very good. The owner (?) came over to make sure everything was okay. One of the meals and one of the desserts came out well after everyone else's, but the owner was apologetic and bought us a couple of our desserts. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The best beet salad and Cubano I've ever had, great wine and Bellinis, and super friendly man behind the bar. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Zucchini fries are a must! So yummy. Nice atmosphere. Not overcrowded on a Friday night. Had a great time celebrating my birthday. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Hot new restaurant alert! Wink 24 is the bomb.com. It has a bright and cheerful vibe, world-class service {from the owner/chef herself} and overall, is a truly incredible experience. You can feel the passion the second that you walk through the door.   My fiance surprised me with a Birthday dinner here with some of my closest friends and we all had an absolute blast. The owner/chef came around and introduced herself which was super special. We started with the Polpette (meatballs), Barbabietola (roasted beets) and Zucchine Fritte. All were incredible and had a nice little kick!   For dinner, I had the Greca salad and Tricolore pizza. The salad was extremely fresh and I could probably eat it every day! So yum! The pizza was also fantastic. I love their spicy chili sauce that they put on the side.   We will 100% be back! Happy Hour is from 2-6 PM as well!"}
{"text":"Went here after checking out Yelp reviews to celebrate our anniversary. Made the mistake of ordering a sparkling wine cocktail, which I'm sure was good but just isn't my cup of tea. They replaced with a phenomenal limoncello, which was delicious. We had the meatball, zucchini and chicken bits apps, and all were great. Light as a cloud lasagna was truly the best I've ever had. App portions were great, but if you like lasagna don't split it with your wife. Portion wasn't that huge. After you get done eating go to the Humane Society digs across the walkway and play with the puppies."}
{"text":"This place is quaint, friendly and yummy.  Great wine selections even for happy hour.  Happy hour is EVERY day 2-6!!!  The service is on point as is the food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In town visiting and stopped here for lunch. My kale salad with grilled chicken was a knockout. Friendly staff and cute ambiance."}
{"text":"Like a ghost in grammy's sheets, rattlin' chains and all, I was visiting old haunts.   I used to work in Biltmore; cut my teeth banging heads, pulling bodies off the floor, making rich white women cry and telling wanna-be anorexic models \"yeah, that extra weight looks good on you.\"   Let's say I was in \"Customer Relations\".   And it was warm today. my dogs were barking like Woof, and I needed good, good food and, oh yes, please, pour this weary traveler some libations to sooooth the hammered soul.   Wink 24.   Let me give you that one more again...  Wink 24. is the business.   Atmosphere, Check! Food, Check!  Libations... CHECK!  Augh, you guys nailed it.   Fucking Peru, man, we can't thank you enough.   \"Drinks were like holy shit.\" --that's a direct quote from my wife. See we were just talkin shop & Peru, craftsman that he is, crafted us a crafty Biltmore Sunrise. Ya'know... Just cos. (Craft)   Yelpers, when you meet this guy, desperately Try. Not. To. Fall. Into. His. Eyes. Like I'm not gay, but I was homo jussss alil' bit there for a minute lol.   Nah, seriously, Dude, thank you man. Great service, drinks & talking shop with us.   Cheers. A refuge from the Az Sun when we needed you. You guys are bad asses doing bad ass work."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic new addition to the Biltmore neighborhood!  We stopped in last Sunday afternoon and enjoyed a bellini, a cheese and charcuterie board and an order of meatballs.  Everything was fantastic - good quality food, flavorful and nicely presented.  I am so excited to come back and try the pizza and pasta on our next visit.  They have a great patio for cooler weather, a nicely appointed dining room (although small) and a nice bar too.  The staff was all very friendly too.  Overall, a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot!  The food was outstanding. We had the opportunity to meet one of the owners who then had us try what I think is my new favorite desert.   Gelato Rolled in hazelnuts  With an espresso shot poured over the top!  Talk about a finishing treat!   The server was knowledgable and gave us details on what wine to pair with our meal.   The food though!  Seasoned to perfection.  We did the flatbread pizza and a salad but don't think this is just your average pizza and salad! A highly recommended spot to add to your must try list!"}
{"text":"Out on a Sunday afternoon we ended up at Wink24. It's tucked into the Biltmore Fashion Park yet still feels cozy. Wink24 has a great casual and vibrant patio with a fire pit. Great for fall evenings ! They had it lit on this sort of gloomy January day. The description of Wink24 says that this is an , 'Italian ; Pizza ; Wine Bar Restaurant' . I would not truly go so far as describing Wink24 as a 'true' Italian restaurant. Only because there are only two pasta dishes on the menu: Lasagna and a Vegetable Lasagna. A couple of meat dishes but they are served with potatoes. There are several really good pizzas! Also several paninis! A great selection of crostini and charcuterie that you can build based on price and size. Happy Hour runs from 2-6pm every day! $6 Wink Bellinis; Free Flow Wine or well drinks & $9 pitchers of beer! There are also some great apps on the HH menu. I started with the Wink Bellini, sparking wine over a mango , coconut or berry sorbet. I chose berry the first round and coconut the next.. I mean, it's Sunday Funday!! This was a perfectly pretty cocktail and not too sweet! Okay the coconut one was a little sweet .. think pina colada with a sparkle fizzy to it. We opted to split the Polpete Meatballs. Three very good meatballs with great Italian sauce and fresh made bread. We loved having the bread for dipping into the sauce ! I ordered the Frommagi pizza. An 11inch pie 'pizza bianco' (white) with of all kinds of Italian cheeses including ricotta, which I love on white pizzas. This great white pizza has carmelized onions and is drizzled with amazing truffle oil. I added sausage for more 'umph' and it was a great pizza ; wood fired with a delicious tasty crust. The house made chile sauce was the perfect 'end drizzle' to the pizza for added zest. I really liked everything about Wink24 and can see coming back for more drinks on this patio around the fire pit. The service was on point. The bar was great and has some great drinks on the menu. The location is a great spot and what is not to love about being in Biltmore?? My only thing is for more of an Italian experience, this is not that. This is however a truly trendy place with a great menu and vibe! Oh.. and PS! The weekend brunch on Saturday and Sunday is amazing !!! Goes until 300pm! ;-)"}
{"text":"I come here fairly often I usually get a panini or a pizza. Last night my wife wanted pasta . Fernanda the owner suggested Tagliatelle with Ragu'. Unbelievable !!! So good. Try it if you haven't . This is the type of business locals should support!"}
{"text":"After walking by Wink on a number of occasions, we finally checked it out on a Sunday afternoon for happy hour (2-6 daily I believe), and found it was the cutest little spot! They have indoor/outdoor at the bar and patio seating outside. I rarely write reviews after the first visit to any restaurant but we were so happy with the experience that I did not want to wait. My daughter had a margherita pizza ($7 on happy hour menu) that was unbelievable! It is the closest thing I've had to NYC pizza anywhere else. My daughter said it was the best pizza she's ever had! Our waiter, Victor, was a lovely guy and told us that the owners are from Italy and Mexico, so both influences can be found on the menu. So even if you aren't in an Italian/pizza mood you can go to Wink for tacos!   It was midday between meals for me, so I had roasted beets on the appetizer menu, also on happy hour, with meatballs on the side. Both were excellent. The beets/arugula were very fresh. I can't wait to try the bruschetta, other pizzas, and tiramisu (which Victor said was excelente). We are always on the hunt for new local joints for weekday meals, and I'm pretty sure we just found our spot! Excellent service, the best pizza, great options on happy hour (read: inexpensive for Biltmore!), healthy options, and patio seating. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I love coming to the Biltmore I was actually on my way to try my usual restaurant Zen burger or Blanco tequila. But I'm so glad I try this new place wink 24, the coolest little place. Very retro very trendy. You can dress casual. Again it's very small but cozy great service. Josh the bartender was absolutely wonderful. Happy hour half price Appetizers from 2-6pm Josh is one of the bartenders, great guy!  Pleasure meeting \"Rio\" bartender, so kind!"}
{"text":"A cute setting, nice little patio. It was not packed but service was still not great. It took a while to get our drink order taken and cocktails delivered. I had the Camelback Basil Martini, and probably would not order it again. When we finally ordered a salad and pizza, they arrived quickly. The bottle of wine we also ordered took so long that it still had not arrived by the time we were half done with dinner, so we found the server and asked that he just bring us each a glass. Prosciutto pizza was just ok. It was definitely helped by the unique chili oil they served with it. Really enjoyed the kale and quinoa salad. There are just too many amazing pizza places in this part of town for me to return to one that was just so-so."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Wink 24 ... so glad I did..Such a great refreshing end to my week. Went over to for lunch after long week and it was amazing. The patio has great ambiance,  peaceful background music, great service and amazing Food. Had Calamari, prosciutto pizza , the steak salad.. and a Stella. Highly recommend Wink 24 for lunch , HH or just a place to have a cocktail to close out your day."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pizza is great , atmosphere is cozy and friendly. Staff is always welcoming and attentive. You can hang out and have dinner or just a drink and never feel rushed. One of my favorite restaurants in Biltmore."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was very disappointed considering the reviews on Yelp which was led us here.  I ordered a Margarita pizza and my son had lasagna. Both were kind of blah until the waitress brought out a St. Marita sauce ( I think it's spelled like that) which really spiced them up. Also the lasagne piece was tiny.   On top of that we both ordered salads and appetizers.  My pizza was brought out before my beet salad so ended up canceling it after 15 minutes.  It's too bad as the restaurant is in a great location and is quite cute."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a lazy Saturday walking through the Biltmore. Nice atmosphere with misters and mellow music playing outside. Got some iced tea and a couple of small plates- the roasted beats and a ricotta crostini. Everything,including the tea, was fresh. The beets were warm in a bed of goat cheese. The crostini was toasted perfectly. The teas were refilled promptly. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Can't say enough wonderful things about this place! It's a marvelous local gem with a cozy atmosphere, friendly and gracious waitstaff, and beyond delicious cuisine. The build-your-own cheese/charcuterie board is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by around 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon because we had a BOGO coupon. The place is beautiful, inside and out. However, the food is not up to par. We ordered the Prosciutto pizza ($14) and a Penne a la Crema di Peperoni pasta ($12.) Our waiter was amazing, especially since it was obvious he was working for a micro-manager. The woman, who I assume was the owner, sat at the bar conducting business, on and off the phone, ordering the cooks and wait staff around during our entire visit. It was extremely unprofessional and made it difficult to focus on our own conversation.  I was really hoping the food would make up for our sitting through listening to her drama, but it did not. The pizza was drowned in arugula with Prosciutto cut so thin and sparsely placed it was almost nonexistent. The pasta dish was half the size of any other restaurant, and the sauce tasted like it was just a jar from the grocery store. At one point the woman stopped micromanaging her bar staff long enough to bring us a plate with 2 small pieces of BURNED ciabatta, acting as though it was the most precious gift we could have ever received. I overheard our poor waiter ask her in passing if every Penne a la Crema di Peperoni dish should come with a side of bread to which she replied with something along the lines of, \"Umm, i don't know. Maybe... What do you think? Actually, yeah. I think we should do that now.\" To top it all off, my husband and I were already hungry again within the hour. We definitely won't be back again for the food, but might try it for happy hour drinks in the fall. their outdoor area is gorgeous."}
{"text":"I heard Wink opened up recently so I decided to come check it out. Great atmosphere: it felt fancy, yet laid back. The place has good decorations. In regards to food, it came out quickly and was delicious. The ice cream with espresso was a perfect topping to the dinner."}
{"text":"Agreeing with some of the average Yelps here. This joint is better than what it was prior, but it's still average for me. Food was not flavorful - nothing popped out for me. The location in the mall is perfect, and the setting is cute. In addition, our server was very attentive (note: it wasn't busy at all in the early afternoon)...but nothing is really enticing me to come back for more...ummm...\"averageness\"."}
{"text":"The very definition of 'Meh.'  My wife and I visited last night - and both came away with the same conclusion.  The food was served warm (not hot - I had a pizza and my wife had a side of meatballs with her Greek salad).  What the pizza lacked in being served hot - it more than made up for with flavorless-ness.  A smattering of benign sauce and toppings served on dough.  My wife had the same complaint about her meatballs - served warm - and basically dull.    The wine list was fine - but small.    Given the number of restaurant options in this area - especially with the proliferation of new establishments copping up seemingly daily - Wink 24 does nothing to distinguish itself from its competition.  Its just another restaurant serving up similar menus as other restaurants and the quality of the food doesn't set itself apart."}
{"text":"We loved the food! The wood fired pizzas are awesome. They also are able to facilitate Ciliacs and Twyla found many options on the menu to enjoy.   The wine list is well conceived and the staff here was fun! They have a dog friendly patio that is super modern in design. Dropped in the middle of a very affluent neighborhood. When your done eating here, the mall is awesome! However, the people watching is even better... #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Finally got to try wink 24. We visited on a Sunday afternoon the place was pretty quiet but we actually loved that it was not pack and noisy. The atmosphere was relaxing and the decor is very modern. They have a daily happy hour from 2-6 if I remember correctly. We got the calamari and pizza marguerita from the happy hour menu. I also helped myself with a glass of wine. In addition, we order the Italian meatballs. Everything was tasty and we will definitely recommend and revisit. Lol The picture I took was half way through the dinner , I was to busy eating the delicious food that I forgot to take a picture first!"}
{"text":"Up until we decided to go here the other night, my boyfriend and I had never even heard of it, but I'm so glad we discovered it! We went on Monday night, so it was pretty quiet and we basically had the place to ourselves which was actually really nice.   If you can make it in time for happy hour they have really good deals - we ended up just eating appetizers for dinner because they were very filling and super cheap! Pitchers of beer are only $9, so that's what we did for drinks. Since they're more of a wine place, they don't have the biggest selection of beer, but I would say there's a good enough mix that you'll find something you like.   We had the Margarita pizza and calamari, which has a habanero glaze and Mexican marinara sauce - it's a little spicy, but not too much! The crust for their pizza is really tasty, too. For dessert we tried the tiramisu, which comes in a jar and is super fluffy and delicious! We will for sure be coming back here again :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. The costumer service was Phenomenal !   Fernanda and her staff are incredibly helpful and accommodating. Marie our server was Super Duper. The food was more than delicious. Veggie pizza crispy and fresh, organic ingredients.  The Bellini is bubbling and fruity. But my new favorite dessert is the Affogato (mama mia).  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great patio with fireplace, pizza is delicious! My favorite is Beet Salad! Try this place soon!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Loved the zucchini fries the tacos are filling, but I still think there is something amiss."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, the food is delicious, the staff is super friendly, and the drinks are great."}
{"text":"Service was awful! After reading some wonderful reviews, I was so excited to try this place. There were only 2 other tables in the place, but our server couldn't be bothered to take out order. He sat in a corner table, talking to his friend and completely ignored us. When we got up to leave, he chased us down and claimed that he was busy doing dishes.  First, he insulted us, then completely lied to us. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour the other evening.   I think the venue would be better for when the weather is cooler since it appears they have to open the very large window at the entrance where the bar extends onto the patio.  Considering the temp was hovering around the 118-degree mark, it made for a hot day.  Checked the happy hour menu.   Wanted to order a manhattan, but their well whiskey was something I definitely had not heard of before.   Therefore, I had it made with Makers Mark, which made it nonhappy hour priced.    Marcus was our very helpful, friendly, professional bartender/server.   (We sat at the bar.)  We asked what he would suggest from the HH menu.   He suggested the zucchini fries, and since I like calamari, I told him I'd like that as well.   I asked if the kitchen would do half zucchini fries/half calamari.   For a couple of dollars more, the answer was yes.  It came with two different dips:  what appeared to be sour cream and the other a marinara.   I don't like marinara, and the other was bland.   I asked what else might be available for dipping.   He thought a chipotle mayonnaise might work.   Perfect!   I think they should use that and skip the white dip.  I must admit, nothing stood out about either the zucchini nor the calamari.   The manhattan was good, I'm happy to report.     I guess, if I were to return, I'd wait till it was cooler so I could sit on the patio, even though there is really no view since it is in the Biltmore Shopping Center, and I'd check out what is on the main menu."}
{"text":"I was in here for happy hour a couple of weeks ago.  Wink 24 used to be another pizza place and they inherited the wood fired oven which was quite a coup.  I knew that I wanted a pizza and since their two happy hour pizza selections were only $5 I went with the margherita.  It was a little larger than a typical personal size pizza and was really quite good.  They also have happy hour prices on drinks and my Lagunitas IPA was only $2.50.  This place is really one of the best happy hour values in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Very good pizza very cool owner very good workers. We'll come back again and you should give it a shot! Josh behind the bar is a very hospitable person. The housemaid chili sauce that they have is nothing like any other Wood-Fired pizza joint has in Phoenix! Must-try!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've visited Wink 24 and I'm beyond pleased!   Our server (Giuliani), is so nice and you can tell that he genuinely cares about his customers and their experience.   He recommended a cocktail called \"Pretty in Pink\" and it was delicious! Not too sweet and just the right amount of kick! I'm always skeptical of new drinks because I'm so picky and I must say, this drink hit the spot!   The food and service are fantastic as well!   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service sucks.  We were in on the evening of 12/01, and there were only two other couples in the restaurant.  Neither the waitress, nor the bartender gave a sh*t about the customers.  At one point, they were both outside chatting and we had to get up and go to the kitchen and ask for missing items.    Unless they get their act together, they won't be around long."}
{"text":"We stay near the Biltmore each time we visit Phoenix. I like the close proximity to the mall and the dining options. This time around, I wanted to try Wink 24 since it was new to us. We arrived and asked to sit at the bar, it is our favorite spot to sit and watch the bartenders mix up classy cocktails.   I ordered a couple different cocktails from their menu during dinner, as each one was very interesting and unique. I ordered a Tito's Mule, Leaving Las Vegas and then to top our night - the bartender made a special drink made with a housemade limoncello.   You can create your own cheese plate picking some of your favorite items from the offerings available. We love these types of plates and to try different cheese and charcuterie. My guy wanted the Bianca pizza; with Italian sausage, mushrooms & mozzarella. Simple, yet the crust was perfect and delicious.   As we were wrapping up our meal, the owner came over and asked us how our meal was. WE ended up in a long conversation about food, which we all enjoyed. She was so nice and friendly, letting us try some of her signature spicy sauces. I wish there was a Wink24 around me to hit up Happy Hour, great deals from 2-6pm daily."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp- had never heard of it and was surprised at how good it was. Grabbed a seat at the bar where the bartender/server was super friendly.  Roasted beets are served over a thick yogurt sauce, generous handful of pistachios, and topped with arugula. Very good.   Kale and quinoa salad with grapes was also very good. I asked for light dressing and they delivered.   Good happy hour deals if you can get there by 6pm. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't get to eat Pizza much and when I do I would like it to fabulous. My husband and I stumbled across this very quaint spot as we needed to pass some time at the Biltmore before dinner and we ended up staying for dinner. Wink is special! Exceptional service (Dave) was friendly and willing to help with recommendations. They have Happy Hour daily 2-6pm drinks, apps and pizzas.  We happen to have the veggie pizza that had mushrooms, red bell pepper, onion, zucchini and it full of them all. The crust/dough was so yummy cooked to perfection I highly recommend the pizza ! The Bellini's (mango and berry) was not sweet but nice and refreshing.  We also had a house salad that was large enough to share the lemon vinaigrette was so tasty this will be a must every visit. Dessert? Well it's a must and that is just based on the tiramisu the chocolate shavings added the perfect touch. Thanks Wink! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time to this awesome place last night and loved it! Bryan was awesome at the bar and made me a great drink with jalapeño simple syrup (what?!). The formaggi pizza was to die for, and the homemade limoncello was better than anything I've had in Italy. I would buy bottle after bottle if they sold it. Will DEFINITELY be making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"While visiting here we ate out every night but came here 2 nights in a row, might be 3  Service was super friendly, treated us like regulars! Thank you! Food was awesome love the rib-eye tacos!!! Pizza was authentic Italian!"}
{"text":"Service is horrific!!! Food is decent.  Our waiter messed up so much happy hour pricing it took us hours to eat and get out."}
{"text":"Fernanda and her staff offer a genuinely exceptional dining experience. From the friendly and charming service, to the fresh and expertly prepared delicious food; \"This is a 'can't miss' spot.\""}
{"text":"Fresh, imported ingredients... amazing flavor profiles and even better service. The vibrance of the owners is reflected in the decor, and it has translated to the staff as well. Perfect place for a romantic dinner or a chill happy hour. Tons of unique wine, beer and cocktails to choose from!"}
{"text":"We read about Wink 24 in yelp while looking for a place to eat in the Biltmore Fashion Center.  The reviews were great and it seemed to be our kind of place.  We were so lucky to go during Happy Hour since most everything we ordered was on the HH menu. We started with the Meatballs in a marina sauce, they were scrumptious! Next we got the Beets, which is more like a salad, with fire-roasted beets, arugula, pistachios and a really creamy yogurt dressing was Delish!! The Zucchini fries were very crisp and light with another type of yogurt dressing. (These yogurt concoctions are so tasty.) Then we split the Veggie Pizza.  AND to top it off we had the Coconut Bellinis, really fun and festive.  Everything was so Yummy.  Josh the bartender took very good care of us and told us about a Pisco Sour.  My honey has had a half dozen in his life and said this was the best one ever, very nice & light but with a really interesting taste.  Josh loves  making them & you could tell.  The highlight of the meal was meeting the lovely owner of  Wink 24, Fernanda Borletti, a gracious host & extremely personable.  The whole experience was delightful & we will definitely return."}
{"text":"After tonight and the absolute WORST service Ive ever experienced...NEVER AGAIN! What a shame too, because we came here often."}
{"text":"Wink twenty-four has a great vibe. I enjoyed their menu selection. We ordered happy hour plates including: a margherita pizza, zucchini fritte, pollo frito, and a salad. The drinks were delicious. The food was light and didn't make me feel gross. I liked that the chef leaves the check in a book she read as a child. What a great personal touch. I will definitely be visiting again, perhaps when it's cooler and I can enjoy the outside dining area."}
{"text":"Wink 24's building previously housed the lackluster Forge Pizzeria, which my girlfriend and I once visited during its dying days last Winter. Since then, taking new ownership, the location has been drastically overhauled and beautifully redesigned as Wink 24.    We've visited them on multiple occasions since first opening and have had the opportunity to try a variety of their food. Their zucchini chips, when on point, are excellent for a starter. Tons of flavor, a nice crispiness, complimented with a yogurt-like dip.   The menu has went through some changes since they first opened. They previously had expanded charcuterie board options that enabled you to build your own. They've since simplified this into one single board filled with the chef's selections.  They've also recently added tacos to the menu. We've tried the al pastor and agreed that it's extremely good, while their ribeye is also decent. We've also tried the La Burger, which is a burger served on panino bread. The bread was very hard and crossed that fine-line between charred bread and burned bread. We didn't really like it as much as we hoped. Lasagna, on the other hand, was excellent on our first try, but very mushy on the second - as if it had been sitting out for way, way too long. Kitchen inconsistencies like this fail in me rating them a bit higher than I'd like.   I read an article about Wink 24 where it was strongly recommended that I request their chile morita oil. I've recently become quite fond of spice-infused olive oils. They have a couple of other options as well. While the morita is classified as smokey with a mild spice, I'd definitely rank the spice as much higher. The smokey flavor hits you almost immediately, while the spice slowly creeps up. I highly recommend you request some if you're into a little spice on your pizza. It was so good, in fact, we requested a cup to take it home to add to the leftovers. Although their pizza as a whole, is just okay, in my opinion.  For dessert, they have a variety of very good options, including the \"Not My Birthday Cake,\" which is sort of an angel food cake with cream cheese frosting and Pepitoria-like Mexican candy. Their house-made churros and affogato are also great as well.  In comparison to the abysmal Forge Pizzeria that previously occupied this space, Wink 24 is a great improvement. I do feel that the menu is a lot of hit and miss - but you're bound to find something that you like. I feel that people who are a sucker for atmosphere and trendy decor will really like how this place is designed. The owner has stopped by to speak with us a couple of times. She seems like a very nice lady who cares about what she's doing here.   I see them as a welcoming addition to Biltmore and recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Very good food. Pizza, salads, paninis and appetizers. Quality ingredients and family recipes.  The zucchini fries are amazing.  The traditional lasagna is delicious.  Cute restaurant and large patio. Good lunch spot while shopping. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Delicious! So flavorful and filling.  My son and I split the Kale and Quinoa Salad and the Formaggi Wood Fired Pizza with sausage. So good! And, as an added bonus, the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Everything is just amazing here. I can't say anything that I don't like here. The service is on of the best Iv ever had so nice. I can't remember her name but she is the best waitress. I come here often one time I eat here three days straight for dinner. I live in LA so when I come to Phoenix this is the place I go first to. My favorite thing to get is the Margarita pizza with pepper and arugula just yuuummm. The zucchini fries are to die for. I can not say anything nangitvie about this place. Every waiter Iv had has been great no mistakes."}
{"text":"We came in for a light meal after a day of travel, for my husband. It was just what we needed! We split the pear salad and a 4 item board and it was plenty of food. That paired with the super refreshing cocktails made this place one well add to our rotation!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, it's located right behind Sephora at the AZ Biltmore. Met up with my wonderful friend for some girl time and loved everything about it. Enjoyed the wine on tap and some apps. Would totally recommend this place for a meet up with friends or on a date. Everyone was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Another trendy, hip pizza / wine bar opens up in Phoenix Area. I must say the ambiance is pretty amazing. They definitely took some time and paid real close attention to aesthetics, especially with the wine bottles they used as fixtures.  I recommend the prosciutto pizza with zucchini frites. The zucchini frites are thinly sliced, fried, and served with this yogurt based dipping sauce - a tasty appetizer to start your meal. The pizza is a classic thin crust, cooked in a wood fired oven. Also, they have a great selection of wine and cocktails too. Great date spot, but not sure how crowded it would get on the weekend nights."}
{"text":"Menu reads well with impressive descriptions but I found the Kale and Quinoa salad was really lacking. Shaved Parmesan was in fact low quality tasteless cheese. Pizza's seemed meh."}
{"text":"Fell in love and frequent this precious little foodie gem, @wink24loves. Fernanda, the owner is passionate about her food creations. Peru and Fernanda continually treat us royally! Had an amazing Father's Day for Bill and discovered their new menu which had more awesome items including Peruvian-style ceviche (my new favorite!) as well as their simply-stated but fantastically flavored Chicken Noodle Soup. Thank you Fernanda! Keep up the incredible work!! #myhappyplace"}
{"text":"We followed our nose, and found a delightful wine bar and restaurant. Their calamari, which we ordered for our appetizer was crisp perfection with a Mexican marinara. We all had paninis with their zucchini fries which came with a tangy yogurt dip. The side salads came with a yummy dressing with a spicy kick. The service and ambiance was wonderful. Wink 24 is a must when you come to Biltmore ar Camelback."}
{"text":"All around Excellent! It's hard for me to say no to this place with their superb pizza(cant forget the chili morito), amazing happy hour specials & amazing people that work here! Keep up the top notch service, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tried to take a picture of the food but too late. I started as soon as it hit the table and it was fantastic. I had the Mattone (chicken panini) it was excellent. My wife had the margherita pizza, and finished the whole thing. Not sure if that says more about the food or her now being married to me. But whatever. We had a great time and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I forced my fam to come here for dinner. I've been selfishly dying to go since they were too packed when I came here a few months ago. The Friday night we went was a much different scene. We were one of only a few tables seated during peak hours...this made me a wee nervous.  Overall the food though was scrumptious. I wouldn't order their artichoke crostini again, it had a weird lukewarm temperature that was a little disappointing. Setting crostinis aside, their beet appetizer was larger than expected with a wonderful yogurt sauce. The potatoes (patate) were a nice filler. More pesto though please! The jaw dropper was definitely their pizza. I'd definitely put it in the top 5 for Phx pizzas. All fresh ingredients including their mozz and parm, with a light bubbly crust, and just look at that prosciutto. Gorg!   I hope I just caught this place on an off day (business wise) because seeing that pizza walk out of my life would be tough"}
{"text":"Wink 24 is a small place in that shopping center across from the Embassy Suites. The food is incredibly good. My fav was the prosciutto and cheese app which came on a big piece of bread. Hard to describe but such amazing flavors!  Meatballs, pizza and calamri was pretty good. Service was spot on. I did not like the open indoor/outdoor vibe as it was a chilly 50 degree night. There was no way around it. There is a big slider to the outside. Wink24 does not have a bathroom but there is a code you are given to a shared one in a hallway around the corner."}
{"text":"Wink 24 located in the Biltmore Plaza- excellent meatballs the best I've had in AZ so far! Chefs board so fresh delicious..great service! Nice vino too! Highly suggest for a nice evening or lunch."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the area I have to stop in! I love this place. So delicious and the staff is efficient and super friendly. I will always be back. Always! And I tell everyone I can about it!"}
{"text":"Noms! After taking almost an hour to decide where to eat, we decided to wing it and try this place. We did not regret it one bit. We tried the meatball panini and chicken panini with zucchini fries! Everything was delicioso! Portions were a good size too--I didn't even finish my dish and I was super hungee. As for the atmosphere, it was a cool dark lit bar with a good amount of seating and a live singer playing right outside with the most soothing voice. It was a little bit loud but that can be expected from a bar so no complaints there. The servers were really sweet as well. out. This spot was right in Biltmore Park area. Tip--parking in the very far back is free (no validation required). Overall, it was a solid experience."}
{"text":"The owner hand makes their tiramisu... I think that says enough but allow me to continue. This is a welcomed addition to the Biltmore area. Cool meets quaint, amazing staff, great cocktails, awesome food and family owned and run. This place is an immediate favorite."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour and they had decent prices. We started with fried zucchini which was pretty good. Next we ordered a margarita pizza and a panini and both were super bland, no flavor at all. I'm surprised this place has such good reviews."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. We ordered 2 different salads 2 lovely martinis, 2 delicious light, crispy authentic Italian pizzas and they insisted on a complimentary desert so we could taste the secret recipe if the tiramisu WOW! Thank you for the hospitality we will come back on a regular basis! I  have highly recommended this little gem to others."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and food. The owner was hanging around and was very friendly - made us feel as if we were a regular, yet it was our first time there.   The food wast tasty and the service nice. I'd recommend for a casual dinner out."}
{"text":"I could not help but check this place out due it's eye-catching outdoor decor. When I came into this place and got first class personalized treatment from Giuliani, I immediate felt very good about my decision. I ordered the Cuban panini, which was good in and of itself but then add to that fried zucchini and a complex and tasty Kronenburg Blanc beer...let's just say I was smiling from ear to ear. Wonderful decor inside too, a nice casual elegance without overdoing it. I am taking off a star because I came back a couple of days ago and the service was slow and the credit card machine wasn't working, though the food still pleased. Hoping that one time was an anomaly but if I get back to Phoenix, I'll check this place out again."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the waiter was a bit rude and not charismatic. He didn't introduce himself. He just said what can I do for you right after we got the menus. Staring at us in a serious way. I think he needs to learn a bit more of customer service."}
{"text":"I simply adore Wink 24. I've ordered it a ton for delivery in the past and it's always hot and fresh. The Messicano panini is delish, the zucchini chips are my favorite part of my meal, and I have loved every pizza I've tried. I made a visit to the restaurant in person today with two kids ~age 10, and they went above and beyond to cater to their picky tastes with simple, cheaper pizzas that were absolutely perfect. I'm so impressed!"}
{"text":"Not too be missed. Walking through the mall and decided to stop because they had a great jazz band playing outside. So glad we stopped. The owner treats you like you are long, lost family- she is so happy you are there and so welcoming. Service was prompt, friendly and efficient. But, oh, the food. Everything is so fresh, high quality and tasty. Tastes as good as it looks. But leave room for dessert-the not quite birthday cake with pistachio brittle is sublime. Bring enough people so you can have the churros, too."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a restaurant.  First of all, it has a super cute and has a whimsical decor and an excellent wine selection. We started with the Zucchini Fritte that my sons scarfed down (and they seriously never scarf vegetables of any kind)..The Classic Caprese was fresh and light. We ordered a few of the pizzas - the margherita, funghi, and prosciutto..all yummy! We were so full, but the waitress convinced us to try some deserts - which we did..the Tartufo Affogato al Ciocolato was to die for. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great spot for a light lunch or a fun girls night...or just a fun family meal.  The service was attentive but not overwhelming too."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience my first time into Wink 24 last night. Marcos was our bartender and he was knowledgeable about the menu, giving us suggestions on things to try. The fried zucchini was to DIE for and we paired it with a Pinot noir. The atmosphere is modern and full of color. We will definitely be back for the food, drinks and Marcos!"}
{"text":"amazing variety of food in a great atmosphere.  I'll keep coming back"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly enough staff. I just had the unfortunate timing of being there when a \"VIP\" decided to stop by for lunch.  He clearly held more importance than the rest of the patrons. I also may have sat too close to a register because I learned far too much behind the scenes information about tips and the cash drawer. It was just generally uncomfortable and I felt like I wasn't wanted. The other time I visited was great but probably because it wasn't busy and the staff had time to pay attention to us."}
{"text":"This place was great! The lasagne was cheesy and delicious! It was also huge! We got the zucchini fried and the meatball app also. Everything was really good and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Love to come to this place. Nice outdoor seating, live music, good prices, the staff is helpful and accommodating. I asked for lemonade but it was too bitter for me, the waiter replaced it for free! The owner gave my mom a free drink just for taste and gave me free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu; love creativity....out there yet not too out there.  Friendly staff......live music occasionally.  Worth checking out!!!! Love the decor.....urban with warmth."}
{"text":"We came across this place in the Biltmore yesterday and we were drawn in with the ambiance. It's super chill and relaxed. We were greeted and told that it was happy hour! The food was amazing! I ordered the \"Bianca Pizza\" which had fennel sausage it was delicious! The calamari was excellent as well! Our awesome waitress, Summer was super sweet and definitely catered to us! We loved the vibes here and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I LOVE a wood fired oven, so we walked over to Wink  24 to see what transformations had taken place in the old Forge pizza location. The updated decor is cute they've done a good job separating the space from the other Union shops.  The outdoor seating has also been expanded.   We ordered the Toscana Crostini, La Burger Panini, and a Margherita pizza.   The crostini, two peices for $5 was a great small bite. The fresh prosciutto on top was tasty and not too salty.   The burger was excellent... great flavor, the wood fired bread, onions, greens and chipotle sauce worked well. The burger is served medium well as its panini style it's a slimmer patty, so if you like to have a say in your meat temperature this probably isn't a great choice.   The burger is served with a side of Zucchini Fritte's and they were the highlight of the meal for me. I will go back just for these alone. Deliciously breaded and seasoned thinly sliced zucchini goodness. The menu said they are served with a yogurt sauce but it tasted like cream cheese to me, either way NO complaints. Delicious!  My boyfriend gave the pizza 3 stars, not bad not great.  He's a cheese only guy so keep that in mind. There are many other choices besides pizza on the menu here and based on the burger/Fritte's/Crostini I would order them again, and I would definitely try some of there other options.   I hope they get the traffic and traction to stay afloat in this location. We were one of two diners, granted it was a Sunday of a holiday weekend but it was lunch hour. Overall the food and service were a solid 3 1/2-4 stars so I'm bumping that up to four."}
{"text":"Uhhhh I feel like I didn't go to the same restaurant that's described in these reviews. A friend and I started sitting outside, but waited for over 20 min for service and decided to move inside to the bar. We ordered a pizza and an order of meatballs since the bartender said they didn't have any pasta (all I wanted was lasagna!). The meatballs were really good... Lots of flavor in the sauce. The prosciutto pizza was.... OK.... But small with super thin crust.... Not filling.... And 17$. That was not so good. Especially given the number of awesome pizza options within a couple of miles. We also got tiramisu which was..... Good..... But not amazing. Anyway, even though this place wasn't bad, it definitely wouldn't be my first choice for pizza in the area."}
{"text":"I liked the food but it did not knock my sock off.  We showed up with a relatively large group and waited quite a while to be served. When the food started coming out, quite a few of the dishes arrived several minutes apart.  As a larger group some delay is expected, but this was a long delay and we were served 3 plates at a time about 5 minutes apart.  That is to say, that although the food is pretty good, they are not set up for larger groups."}
{"text":"I have learned that any time a place gets so many 5 stars to watch out!  Something fishy here! Well perhaps or perhaps not. This is a new place and small.  8 tables inside, room at the bar for 11 but a patio outside,  My take? Let's start with the bad. 1.  I found crumbs at my table. Had to clean myself. 2.  The bar stools are cheap hard metal with no back someone bought at a garage sale and painted orange.  Very uncomfortable and no back to hang your purse or coat. 3.  If you want an upscale place don't hire biker chicks with homemade tattoo's please. 4. I asked to use the mens room to wash up.  You have to go outside the building, and walk to the bathroom doors down the mall!.  I wonder how many people are going to use this to skip out without paying?  LOL 5.  Pizza look soooo good in the yelp pictures.  not in person--crust dry and thin with little toppings.  OKAY the GOOD 1.  The pizza was happy hour so only $7 so i can live with it. 2.  The fried Zuchinni (sic) was good at $5. 3.  The service from the bar tender was great--I tipped him 35%  But some advice--don't tell your buddy what an asshole the owner is in front of customers--I could snitch you off and get you fired.  I might go back if in the mall but not going out of my way.  These jerkoff's that gave 5 star reviews are the same brain dead morons who think Obama and Hillary should run the country.  IDIOTS!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is decent enough.  But they really cannot accommodate a large group.  On top of that, the wait staff was about as unhelpful as you could get.  It was up to us at the table to move our own tables and chairs, and to get up and retrieve our own place settings.  I would expect a little better from a place with these prices, or really from anywhere.  Some of us were waiting so long for our food that we told the others not to wait for us and to dig in so their dinner didn't get cold.  I'm not sure I would venture there again."}
{"text":"Got the Diavola pizza with fennel sausage added on for takeout. Very good pizza! Crust was perfect combo of crisp and doughy. Delicious sauce without overdoing it. Great toppings."}
