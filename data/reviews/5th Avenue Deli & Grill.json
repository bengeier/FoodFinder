{"text":"I remember going here a few years ago and hating it. But i couldn't remember why. I went today with my mom and sister, and now I remember: the food was terrible and the staff was unimpressive. 

I ordered bacon, eggs and hashbrowns with toast. I asked for my toast to be plain, but it came out with a \"yellow flavoring\" making it greasy and soggy. My eggs were cooked properly overeasy, I appreciate that (hence the second star in my rating). My hashbrowns had no color on them whatsoever. They were just greasy and mooshy, there was a puddle of grease underneath them. My bacon wasn't cooked crisp, and maybe it is a personal preference, but I don't like it when the bacon fat is still soft and chewy. 

I only ate my eggs and toast with the weird fake butter on it. The waitress noticed and asked why I didn't eat. I told her it was a little greasy for my taste, and she said \"what do you expect it's breakfast food?\" So it's my fault, I guess.

My mom mentioned how bad my breakfast was to the manager (?) and he told me I had picked a bad time of day to order breakfast and took about 2-3$ off our bill. (My breakfast was 7$). So again, I guess it was my fault for ordering something off the  ALL DAY BREAKFAST MENU at the wrong time for him.

Everyone else there looked like they loved their food, and they all looked like regulars. I was uncomfortable in my chair and it was too loud for me. I won't be back. Somehow I don't think they will care."}
{"text":"Just had a craving for potato pancakes. So while in Mayfield we made a stop at 5th Avenue grill&deli.ordered the #8 on the breakfast menu.Very happy to find a small (2) order of fresh potato pancakes , two eggs  and a choice of breakfast meat all for less than $10. As usual the potato pancakes were served with apple sauce or sour cream. Our late breakfast really hit the spot.great place to nosh ."}
{"text":"Loved it. Has the great feel of a diner. Had great corned beef and hash. The entire staff was extremely friendly. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I am visiting from FL and have traveled all over America. There's only a few places I've been that actually make me leave a review. You need to eat here. It reminded me of the food in Boston. Fresh, high quality and homemade. I have food allergies so it's hard for me to eat out and actually enjoy the meal. The manager (or owner, not sure) actually came to my table and talked to me about what they can make safely for me. I only wish I lived here so I could come a few times a week. I had an omelette with veggies and their potatoes. Amazing. Must try. You will come back. Staff is extremely friendly too, there is a mom and pop vibe here. I'm sure everyone there was a regular."}
{"text":"My family eats here regularly and we have never had anything but excellent food and excellent service.  It's the only place that can accomodate the diverse tastes of family members, from the traditional Lebanese food to the classic diner/deli picks, all done to perfection.  I recently have had to avoid many ingredients due to food allergies, and the owner's wife helped me to choose from the menu and then gave directions to the grill team.  It's now the only place I can safely dine out! 5th Avenue is always a top pick."}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy their food very much but please don't order the bagels!  2 day old stale.  Stick with something else."}
{"text":"This is a great place for any meal of the day. I mostly go for lunch as I work nearby but they always have fresh tasty food! The style of food has a little Mediterranean flair to it. The soup is always super hot! They have enough tables that we never have problems getting a table, but also keep them in mind for carry out! A family run and owned diner they are always around making sure the service is up to par. They have earned this 5 star rating many times over!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced. It's across from Beachwood mall but it wasn't too crowded on a Saturday afternoon. The staff was friendly and attentive. It seemed like a great place to pick up a sandwich or something for dinner as well as great place to stop and have a quick (yumm) bite."}
{"text":"Currently eating here as I write this. This is the first time we've been here. It took a few min to be seated, and even longer for a server to acknowledge us. At one point here were three just standing behind the counter trying to figure out what they were doing. When she finally appeared, there was no hello. Just \"what would you like to order.\" Right now I just heard another server walk by saying \"they need to stop seating me.\" This is hardly what I would call busy. And by the way, people seating you means more money. If you're in the weeds, you walk by and let your table know you see them, and will be with them. You don't ignore. I'm not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"The lean corned beef sandwiches , soups and breakfasts are all  very good. I've also liked the lebanese platters (hummus and shawarma). All in all, a great little family run deli. 

 The owners have never been anything other than warm and gracious to me."}
{"text":"On August 12, 2016 First time eating at the 5th Avenue Deli & Grill......great place....sat at the bar and had a blast with Patty Erin Mark and Dominic (the cook) whose dad I had the pleasure of meeting at their restaurant on Som Center in Eastgate Mayfield Heights, OH....give them a try I think you will be impressed.

I had the Century Red Wine - Mussells/Shrimp  & Linguini - Apple Crumb Cheesecake - Grapefruit Martini....they have an happy hour great price $5"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting 5th Avenue Deli Friday November 22, 2013 for the second time........first off let me tell you that this is a family ran business who are Lebanese and I had the pleasure of owner Mark serving us today....very personable just a pleasure for him to take pride in making suggestions of course none of which you could wrong with.....while deciding what to get he offered to let me sample the clam chowder....OMG....it was deelish....hearty and hot......because it was raining, cold, and windy out having a big bowl of this soup sounded great but I opted for the Reuben with cole slaw.....personally I don't have a taste for corn beef often but when I do honestly Slyman's is the place to go hands down.....so I decided to try their Reuben and let me tell you it definitely gives Slyman's a run for their money....I ate it ALL which is hard for me because 9/10 times I'm only eating 1/2 the food and boxing it for later....not so....if you are up in the Mayfield Heights area stop by and see Mark at the 5th Avenue Deli...you'll love the quaint family atmosphere......I plan on trying more items and will definitely be back.....another Gem hidden in the plaza off Som Center."}
{"text":"Lebanese menu is amazing. All made from scratch. Very good variety of food. Family owned!"}
{"text":"Had the turkey club wrap on the advice of a friend and it was very good. The service was attentive and pleasant. Also tried the potato skins; they were good too. I look forward to coming back here to try more dishes and some of the sweet desserts. I'd recommend that you try this place out."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience in Cleveland before I came here. The service is horrendous and the food is over priced. The staff is rude and the food is mediocre. Save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is very average. The cake is usually very stale. I have bought about 3 slices of chocolate cake so far and it was stale twice. They made a mistake with our order one time and asked us to pay extra if we wanted what we ordered even though we were told earlier that we did not need to pay extra for substituting one side dish with another. So experience was blah."}
{"text":"This is the most horrible restaurant I have ever stepped foot in in my 46 years of life. Do not eat here. Tell everyone you know not to eat here! 
They have a menu on line that does not match the menu in their restaurant. I ordered 12 meals from the menu online for the staff members at my work today. They overcharge me by $40 and then had the gall to blame me and told me I was wrong because they have a sign on their front door stating their prices on the menu do not match the prices online. I ask you. How would I know of that sign when I ordered online and did not come to the restaurant? They were rude. They were mean. They were even insulting. I will never step foot in that restaurant again for the rest of my life and will tell everyone I know never to eat there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful!  Service was excellent and the food very tasty. Not sure what the name is.. 
I had grilled chicken slices over a very generous portion of hummous  with pita bread on the side.   Very, very good. Portions just right."}
{"text":"Falafel is good but the corned beef is probably the worst in Cleveland. Literally zero flavor- I don't think that I'll be back"}
{"text":"Ohhh yeah! 
This place is our Sunday morning breakfast go-to place! We come in almost every week!
Service is good, food is good!
I always order the 'eggspectation', which admittedly is hard to screw up (eggs., cheese, tomatoes on an English muffin). My boyfriend loves their corned beef hash...it is clearly made fresh and not out of a can like some places. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"We came from Tampa to Akron and drove towards Chardon and decided to stop here because of the ratings on Yelp... Not sure why it's got high ratings. We walk in and it was hotter than outside which the temperature outside was about 85 degrees. The waitress took her time coming back to us even though we were the only ones in there. She was sweet... I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu which was the lox platter. When it came to the table there was only 3 slices of lox with some other fixings for $14.95, which is not worth the price. It's decent if you want a salad. Definitely not in a hurry to come back next visit."}
{"text":"I hope St. Peter remembers the sacrifice I made for Ash Wednesday today!  Saw the positive reviews on Yelp, so thought I would give this place a try. 

Came in for lunch just after 12:00 on a Wednesday. Hemmed and hawed about going meatless all day, after all, I was confirmed Lutheran and became Catholic after kids. Asked the waitress if the tuna salad was any good. She said yes, so I asked for a sandwich on wheat bread. 

The plate cane out of the kitchen in less than 3 minutes. Plenty of tuna salad, but it was bland and on rye. I didn't complain, as it needed something and maybe rye would help. It also had lettuce and tomato, which was closer in color to the lettuce than red. 

I decided to see if I just got the luck of the draw, or are all their tomatoes under ripened, so I ordered a fatoosh salad to go. Turned out the tomatoes wasn't that much better, but the salad was excellent! Just overpriced. $10 for lettuce and fixens without meat just doesn't seem right."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot!!! Be warned though, you will leave smelling like the kitchen! ;)"}
{"text":"Great service. Our food was delicious. Smoked salmon bagel was great. Potato salad was awesome. Cheesecake looked fantastic but I was traveling so I couldn't take any to go. I'd come back if I was ever in the area."}
{"text":"I'm in sales, and I'm always looking for good places to eat in the field. 5th ave is definitely one of my favorites. The hummus is the best in Cleveland, and the burgers are unexpectedly delicious! The staff is friendly, and they love to get to know their customers."}
{"text":"Great place any time of the day!! Portions are substantial and staff is friendly. Prices are reasonable for all the great food options! Keep it up"}
{"text":"I'm from Miami & i'm up in Ohio for some work. I came here & ate one of their 
lebanese dishes (yes..the owner is Lebanese) & it puts Alahdin to shame. 
Place has great prices & the food is authentic & very, but very tasty! I keep coming 
for lunch! I'm not sure of these negative comments...nothing to be negative about..
NOTHING."}
{"text":"This place has become a new favorite of mine. The hummus and falafel rolled is my favorite item so far. The tabouli is so fresh and tasty. The chicken shawarma rolled is also pretty good. The price here is very reasonable and the beverages are amazing. I will be coming here a lot more often."}
{"text":"Totally disappointing!  Ordered an omlette.  I substituted mushroom for bacon in it. When it arrived to my table it didn't have the Swiss cheese in it and it was totally over cooked.  I didn't want to complain but I did ask for the cheese.  The server came back to tell me after putting the cheese on it that the owner was charging me for the cheese.  I asked why seeing that it was listed on the omlette in the menu. When I asked to speak with him she came back to say he said if he could he would make time to talk to me.  Wtf! Ok... so I try to support small business everywhere instead of the franchise but forget it.  He is obviously making plenty by over charging to not care...such a little thing to lose a customer over."}
{"text":"I love this little place for lunch. I typically order the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  I don't know what voodoo that they do with the chicken, but it's GREAT. Staff very nice."}
{"text":"This deli is on our rotation of breakfast places, we get a good breakfast at a reasonable price, so this gets my award for a\"solid\" business...you know, the kind of place you go to when you are tired of the restaurants that hire clueless teenagers (I am looking at you, Bob Evans at Cedar Center).

I like to treat myself on Sundays, so I ordered the French toast, it was fine but could be better with some cinnamon/vanilla seasoning.  Boyfriend has ordered various meals and has always liked them.

The service is usually very friendly, even when all the tables are filled.  The waitresses have always been great, friendly and talkative or they leave you alone if you are not in a chatty mood.  Also on the plus side is that this is a locally owned company, in that  SOM center location since the early 80's, and that says a lot."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. I had the potato pancake appetizer and the corned beef hash appetizer. The hash was lacking seasoning, but after I added a bit of s/p it was pretty good. the potato pancakes were excellent. My wife had an omelet, that she just loved. The waitress was pretty good, but only offered to refill our coffee when we had finished our meal and she brought the check. I'd definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Corned beef omelette, absolutely delicious. Definitely one of the better omelettes I've ever had. Traditional style New York deli here that has an authentic, yet updated feel to it. Only knock on the place is they messed up my sisters order putting a topping into her omelette that she asked them to leave out. Pretty good Bloody Mary as well. Much more pulpous than most bloodies around these days yet still very savory and not too salty."}
{"text":"I had visited 5th Avenue Grill a few years ago and was less than impressed with some of the middle eastern offerings, so I had not been back, until this past weekend.  I was in a bit of a hurry and initially went to a nearby restaurant, which had a bit of wait, so I decided to try 5th Avenue again.  I was seated right away and given a menu.  I ordered a glass of water and the corned beef hash.  The server was very nice, but a bit pre-occupied, she attempted to wait on 2 tables at the exact same time, and it wasn't quite working.  Anyway, my meal arrived a short time later.  A generous portion of corned beef hash, perfectly cooked eggs over medium and rye toast.  I knew immediately that the hash was going to disappoint.  There was a nice ratio of meat to potatoes, large strips of onions, instead of chopped and incorporated.  Also the texture, was not great, should have been left on the grill a bit longer.  Maybe I should have ordered it well done?  I ate most of it, but secretly wishing it had more of a crust to it.  The eggs were perfect and the bread was fresh.  I finished the meal, and stacked the dishes and set them aside, and began to wait for my check.  As I mentioned the server was a bit pre-occupied, this time doing something behind the counter, with her back to the dining room for a long time.  After about 10 minutes, I gathered by things and approached the counter, she turned around after a few moments and realized that she hadn't followed up with my check.  I paid the bill and left.  This probably won't be my go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"A pleasing, warmly lit atmosphere in an unexpected location, with friendly service, ample portions and solid mix of good quality Mediterranean,Deli and standard American Diner fare. Small full bar attracts mainly happy hour residents of the apartments surrounding the restaurant as parking limits visitor traffic somewhat. If you're in the area and want healthy or comfort food, recommended."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu, friendly service, family atmosphere! Great breakfast and lunch deli menu and they do offer gluten free substitutes if you ask. It's a smaller place so if you go on a weekend you may have to wait (pretty standard for breakfast on weekends)."}
{"text":"This was delicious - they were super busy and the wait staff was efficient but not friendly. The food spectacular! This deli grill is set in a strip mall but when you enter you forget it's in a retail mall - the decor is pleasant. They have an awesome selection of food at several price points. Everything we ordered had good portion sizes and was well prepared. I would come here again."}
{"text":"We did breakfast there for the first time. Generous portions to where we had to take some home. Staff on top of thing. Friendly. Food out very quick. We will stop again when in the area."}
{"text":"Great breakfest food is a never ending quest. Go here and your mission is complete. Great coffee, fresh orange juice, and heavy on the vegetables. They will let you swap egg whites for regular eggs. The food comes out fast hot and tastey."}
{"text":"Great authentic middle eastern food. Relaxing quiet ambience- perfect for conversation."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go to for a quick healthyish fresh made meal. Today I  ordered the chicken kabob on hummus with a fatoush salad. The chicken came out in thin strips - huh??? - deli meat from Costco fried with onions and green pepper and the hummus was certainly not as tasty as usual I'm wondering if it was made by Sabre. Very disappointed- Aladins here I come."}
{"text":"I tried to get the breakfast special (pancakes & strawberries) but even though it was listed on the menu board on the sidewalk, it was not available (then why was it listed?)

Instead I got the \"wall street\" salad. It was an enormous plate of spinach with at least a cup of sundried tomatoes, some cheese, pecans and balsamic dressing. Although it wasn't so much balsamic dressing as just straight up balsamic vinegar, which was so acidic that eventually I had to stop eating it just so my teeth didn't disintegrate. Now I see from the menu that it should have been raspberry dressing which would have been much better.

This is actually a really pretty restaurant on the inside, with a big dessert and meat case, lots of dark stained wood tables and lovely glass light fixtures. The server was friendly. They do have an interesting menu with all sandwiches named after various locations (including a \"twin towers\" sandwich LOL). It might be worth it to try something else, but it's also probably much cheaper just to skip down to Heinen's and buy your own roast beef."}
{"text":"I've eaten her a number of times. It's good, affordable breakfast and brunch food.

I usually get an omelet of some sort. I like their offering tomatoes and cottage cheese as a lower carb alternative to home fries and toast/ bagel at no extra charge. The omelets are generously portioned  (with 3 jumbo eggs) and fluffy. You can also get egg whites, again, at no additional cost.

They have Sriracha and Frank's Red Hot hot sauces, which are good options. They also have, sugar, Equal and Sweet & Low. No Splenda, sorry.

The staff here is friendly. The dining room isn't large, so expect a wait during peak times. During peak times, the staff will occasionally fall behind. Otherwise, they're on top of things (checking in, refills, asking how you're doing, etc.)."}
{"text":"Great little place. To call it a deli really doesn't do it justice. They have really good hot and home made dishes like open face Turkey with amazing mashed potatoes and gravy. The salads are huge and the lettuce is always fresh and the dressings are yummy. Decent kids menu as well. The kids portions are also fairly large..good for kids with big appetites. Nothing fancy to note about the atmosphere. Very basic but plenty comfy. Lots to choose from for any meal of the day."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast spot. Wait staff were efficient and friendly. The food was prepared exactly as we ordered it, we asked for our home fries to be extra crispy and they were excellent and plentiful. The price was very reasonable for the portion size and quality. The room itself is pleas and clean. All in all a good experience, and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a review of The Hamptons new location.
The food was delicious,  selected from a menu with many tempting choices.  It is a deli of the Corky and Lenny's caliber, but with better service and more appreciative owners.  I was there today for lunch with a group of 9, all of whom enjoyed the lunch-a real feat.This place will be one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"A hidden gem across from Beachwood place mall at The Hamptons. A very casual and upscale diner with outdoor seating and with huge selection of food with generous portions. This deli has something for everyone. This is a family owned and operated establishment tucked in a quiet enclave in Beachwood, away from the hustle and bustle of the mall crowd. Friendly service and a chef that can cater to specific needs as they arise. Open for breakfast lunch and dinner with a huge Sunday brunch.  Give it a try and you will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried the falafel and chicken shawarma sandwiches and was quite disappointed. The restaurant may be fine for American food, the sandwiches and such looked good, but the small Lebanese section of the menu is not worth the trip. The falafel was flavorless and not crisp. The chicken in the sandwich looked and tasted as if it had been boiled rather than cooked on a spit and it was drowned in so much sauce the pita dissolved into an unappetizing glob. 

Service was prompt and friendly, but didn't rescue an underwhelming lunch."}
{"text":"Lunch experience: a very well run restaurant, where the folks seem to care about the customers. I got their beef Lebanese combo, which was fine. Hummus was not as good as I expected given the praise from other reviews on yelp. Anyways, the platter was not my favorite dish, I may stay away from the Lebanese menu next time and try one of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"A true value with great food prepared well and some of the best servers I know.. we had a wonderful lunch that simply tasted great, arrived hot and rapidly, and left us happy and satisfied.  A perfect lunch experience in my book..  THANKS"}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful meal of tabouli at the 5th Ave., Grill. Not a frequent diner out I am very impressed with their service and their personality as well as the great meal!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a restaurant.com coupon for this place.  When I went to pay they refused to take it, claiming that they only accept 2 per day, and I was too late.  There was no way to know this before ordering.  Not only do they have this ridiculous, unethical, undetectable rule, but they became extremely rude and angry when I calmly challenged this action.  Under NO circumstances would I ever go back, nor would I recommend anyone else go there.  You don't need to go to a restaurant to be abused and mistreated."}
{"text":"Some of the best corned beef hash in town, lots of corned, beef, onions, chopped green tomatoes, mmm.  Overall this deli is among the best in Cleveland.  They also have a small selection of Lebanese dishes, which are very good.  The Lebanese run the best delis in Cleveland (are you listening Corky and Lenny's?)"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, solid omlettes, friendly staff.  We've been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where the negative comment came from. When I went into this place, it was calm and great atmosphere. This is a great little place to eat. Friendly atmosphere and friendly wait staff. The waiter was very friendly and had great conversation. Food is great. I tried the Lebanese food and it's far better than Aladdin's Eatery in my opinion. Very well seasoned. The bakery counter is huge. We were so full that we can't resist the dessert. We had a dessert takeout. The coconut cake is great. The raspberry chocolate with mocha icing is to die for. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Love it! As someone who was raised in New York it reminds me a bit of being home. Everything I've tried here has been delicious, and the staff all have amazing customer service! My favorite is the bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel with their amazing home fries! The potato salad and chicken noodle soup is also to die for!"}
{"text":"Sweet surprise when I saw the menu. A friend had been trying to get me to eat there but I'm not into deli food. Finally I agreed a week ago and much to my amazement, the menu was a mix of items from different cultures and it had some of my favorite dishes. I ordered the chicken shawarma over hummus and it was to die for. The flavor was outstanding and it was perfect. I will get this to to next time because I would like to have some celery and cucumbers for the hummus.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Usually go here for breakfast as it seems hard to find a good simple morning place in the area and don't have the time to wait in line at eat at Joe's. service is decent and food is good. Prices for breakfast reasonable. Same staff all the time, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Wonderful service! You can tell the family takes pride in their restaurant. You do not have to wait long to be seated and food is delivered promptly."}
{"text":"This is a decent neighborhood deli. The corned beef sandwiches are really good and the deli sandwiches are their specialty. Anything beyond that is stretching it... The matzo ball soup was AWFUL and had no flavor. Our waitress was not friendly and did the minimum. She took our order, brought the food, and brought the check. We felt rushed and pushed out of there. She didn't even refill our waters or check back to see if everything was alright. It is slightly overpriced but the food was a good portion size. The bakery also has a nice selection."}
{"text":"Ordered a corned beef sandwich to go with a spicy mustard. The menu says 8 oz of meat. When the waitress gave me the sandwich is said there is extra bread because there's alot of meat. Ha!! 8 oz is 8 oz. There's was extra bread because on slice had a major air pocket which I had to replace with the extra bread. The spicy mustard was in a container, but there was not a knife to spread it. There also was no pickle which most delis in America give with a sandwich. Not a satisfying way to start lunch. This was at there Beachwood location in the Hamptons, maybe the other location has quality help."}
{"text":"I've actually been more than the times I've checked in. But this place is always good. 
Excellent service and a Friendly staff!!

The omelettes are really good with many choices. And they also have a lot of choices for sandwiches during lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. Good omelets and great home fries with onions. (And you can get this all the time, not just in the morning.) Nice inside, although it gets crowded at times and closes a little early (for me). Service is always friendly and fast. Prices seem just slightly high maybe, but not enough to keep me away.

Beyond breakfast, I've had a good falafel sandwich and good hummus.

The dessert case always looks good, and I finally tried one: very good cheesecake. My server, without being asked, pointed out which varieties were fresh and which had been in the case a while. That was nice of him.

Also they have an odd but great vegetarian sandwich (likely even vegan?) called the Byblos. It's basically french fries and hummus in a pita. When you want that potato carb fix, it's very good!

And my friend from NYC approves!"}
{"text":"I recently went here because I used to go to the one in the mayfield location. But since this is closer by my house I thought I'd try it out. It is located inside an apartment building complex. It is right by beachwood mall. The place itself is small. I went for dinner around 7 o clock and there were few other tables. You can sit wherever you choose. I sat at a booth. They have the same full menu just like in mayfield, but they also have an extended menu. I chose to go with the extended menu. I got their chicken pasta which came with a house salad. And I also got a basket of fries. The pasta was very delicious and so were their fries. The house salad was okay. I got 2 drinks just a bud light and they charged me $10. Overall i like the food here but I just wont be drinking."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be one of my favorite places, but when a restaurant tells me I can't have lemon with my water, I find somewhere else to go. I also really find one of their servers very annoying. The food, for the most part, is good, but they nickel and dime you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Cleveland. Such friendly service with consistently great food. Some favorites include corned beef, matzo ball soup, and some of the best hummus in the area. Give it a try. Your welcome"}
{"text":"The quality of food warrants a 4 star rating but I can't do that due to the service. First the food...

I have had the chicken Caesar wrap, shawarmas, shish tawook, reuben, hummus, and tabouli. Everything has been good and their fries are #1 in my opinion. We never get pita bread with our tabouli appetizer unless we ask for it which is annoying - it should come with it like every other restaurant that serves Lebanese food in Cleveland. They don't provide enough pita bread to enjoy all of the hummus so we end up taking a lot of it home when we would rather eat it there. All that being said - I have always enjoyed the quality and quantity of food minus the lack of pita bread.

The service...usually it is pretty bad. Getting seated isn't a problem but a lot of the time placing an order is. I don't feel like it is overwhelmingly busy for the wait staff and the last time I was there 2 waitresses stood at the counter talking for 10 - 15 minutes before one of them came to our table and asked if we had been helped yet. I rarely see them smile and usually the only time they are pleasant is when I am paying the bill and leaving a tip at the register. This is one of our favorite places to eat due to its location and quality of food but the wait staff could really use some training. It never hurts to smile every once and awhile."}
