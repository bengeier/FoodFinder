{"text":"The Shire Coffee what more can I say?! Amazing coffee with so many choices!, teas,quesadilla( my favorite)  energy drinks, smoothies, hot cocoa and delicious coffee cakes muffins and treats! Of course even with all of those things being so great there is nothing that can match their customer service! They set the standard for a great coffee experience!"}
{"text":"The coffee is honestly pretty good, which I didn't expect for the price. I got an iced mocha and an egg and cheese croissant and it cost a little under 6 dollars. I was worried when there wasn't any salt or pepper out, but the egg was well seasoned and the cheese isn't fake American cheese.   The mocha wasnt too sweet and the small was most places mediums.   The only reason it lost a star is because there's a bit of confusion of what chicken tenders are. My friend ordered them and it took a bit to come out (no big deal, only one person was working) however once he got them,  it was just grilled chicken fillets of some sort with bbq sauce.   He said they tasted good but the menu had a picture of fried chicken tenders so he was a tad disappointed"}
{"text":"Such a clean place with friendly staff! I love stopping there for coffee especially with the convenient location close to ASU campus! Their drinks are so delicious, but a little pricey! But it's definitely worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chai tea frappe in town! It has a texture that I could not exactly explain. It seems like it was not well blended, but I LOVE it. The owner and stuffs are very nice.I would try other stuff next time!"}
{"text":"Nice and good place in Phoenix to have coffee and tea I tried herbal teas and really like it.  It is very nice to come this place with your family and friends"}
{"text":"I wanted to try their special boba tea and it was pretty cool, plus on sale. Since it's still a new little gem in the heart of ASU it was less chaotic to spend time and do my homework. Overall the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Well, I realized this place opened recently in Tempe and I gave it a try. After my 7th visit, I can easily recommend this place for a number of reasons.  First off, it is a very clean coffee shop. From taking an order to all the way to the receiving the order, everything is handled very cleanly.  Secondly, Baristas are very friendly and informative. If you happen to ask questions about their coffee, they might give you detailed information without boring. Listening to stories of individuals from different countries always is fun to hear.  Thirdly, The menu items are handpicked so if you go with Chai or The Shire Blend as well as eatery menu, you can't go wrong. My favorite \"Gozleme\" is the one with spinach and what I really like about that unique item is, it is always done with fresh ingredients. Plus, it is very satisfying and you might ask for the second one. Despite the traffic of the students rushing out of their dorm, it is still convenient for me to work or study.  Enjoy your coffee, or take care of your hunger .. This \"new\" cafe is a gem to be found. You can thank me later..."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and happened upon this great coffee shop that is located below the Rise Apartments on Apache.   Coffee is tasty and cheaper than Starbucks so ASU Students come check this place out.   Cute outdoor seating area.   Met the owner who was really nice.  I strongly support small business.   Strong Yay to Shire Cafe"}
{"text":"New little coffee shop below the apts. Since  opened, the owner has added Italian sodas and pastries. If you are ever walking down Apache and need something to drink... This is the spot."}
{"text":"The coffee shop has a great location and various parking options. Besides, the shop has a authentic environment. I ordered small mocha hot. Great taste. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A real coffee shop next to campus. Nice drinks and food. Fast WiFi, comfortable couches and chairs."}
{"text":"I was visiting from New Jersey to see my friends and have a quick work meeting near Tempe and accidentally bumped into Shire as I was looking for a Starbucks. This place was really quite and had a great ambience in the very load college town. They even serve Turkish coffee!! Metin the owner was at the counter and gave us a 15% off too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really cute place, looks super clean. They have really good prices, not overpriced like most coffee shops around Tempe. The barista was really nice too."}
