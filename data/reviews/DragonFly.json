{"text":"A little bit above the quality of your average greasy Chinese place. Good for both take-out and eating in."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular of Dragon Fly a few years ago... They had excellent fried rice and food was always fresh... I don't know what happened? I guess they changed their cooks or something because their food has significantly declined in taste. I ordered house special fried rice for take out one night and it was DISGUSTING! Way too much salt/soy sauce which pretty much ruined the entire dish for me. I've tried to give this place a few extra opportunities but I think it's time for me to part ways with them."}
{"text":"We did take-out at Dragon Fly, which generally saves on tip, drinks, and over-eating temptations.  I even walked there to work up an appetite.   We tend to get the same thing over and over at Chinese restaurants.  I know it's boring, but it is a great way to compare who has the best food.  The menu here is very consumer-friendly (and available on-line, great for take-out without the wait) and the prices are reasonable.  Once we find 'our place', then we branch out from there.  My husband got the General Tso's chicken with brown rice.  According to him, it was average. I tasted it, and agreed. Usually there is not enough sauce for my taste in this dish, but there was plenty of sauce, so the rice was also full of flavor, even when you finished your chicken.  I got the chicken and broccoli, and found it slightly above average. Again, it was saucy, so there was much more flavor involved than usual. It wasn't too salty, either, which some places do to disguise the fact that the dish is mostly bland vegetables (gasp!) I also had brown rice, and it was done well.    The egg drop soup (which is a Chinese food staple for me) was good--pretty average, nothing too special, but I finished the single serving.  I always add pepper to mine because I like the added kick, but the flavor would have been fine without it.   I have heard that the atmosphere is nice and enjoyable, so I will definitely eat in soon enough.  This is a restaurant worth checking out if you live in SouthPark.  I don't think it is a destination restaurant, though. A good chinese place should be available in most neighborhoods in the area, at least I hope!!  I will probably do a bit more shopping around for our go-to chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Really exceptional food, nice menu, quality ingredients, pleasant service and atmosphere. Went for dinner with friends for New Year's Eve. Had pan fried dumplings, spring rolls, mo shu pork and pan fried noodles with shrimp. I usually eat healthier when I go for lunch, but hey, it was New Year's!  I think the quality is just as good if not better than PF Changs and without the wait or noise and the prices are very reasonable. They practically give away lunch and dinner is still a great deal. In this economy, I'm very particular about how I choose to spend money and this fits the bill in every way."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant a few days ago for a quick bite for lunch. It was my first visit. I thought it was pretty decent Chinese food. I ordered sesame chicken with fried rice and an egg roll with a drink. The cost was about $10. Our food was served quick and hot. This seems like a pretty popular place for lunch. Servers were all really nice. I would be back."}
{"text":"I love coming here!  Quiet atmosphere, food  arrives quickly.  Awesome lunch specials, good prices and lunches come with an egg roll!  Everything tastes fresh and is served hot, perfect place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I stopped eating here cause I can never get my stinkin' sushi in under 45 minutes.  One time it took AN HOUR.  Not bad once you get it, but it just always take too damn long."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we have been eating here for many years and the food was excellent. On our last trip found it had changed names. We walked in looked at the new menu and left. Found hardly any dishes we had had in the past. I wish them luck but we will be eating Chinese somewhere else from now on....."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised by some of these reviews. I've only gotten takeout from DragonFly (never inside) but I've now done it 4 times and been pretty darn satisfied when I picked the food I wanted.  Let's start with the \"Average and acceptable\". The Fried Rice is the way I like it - a little salty and well done. However it really could use an extra egg and some veggies. It's offered as a side dish with everything so I know they want to cheap out, but this place would earn half a star from me if they spent an extra .25/serving on adding some ingredients to the rice. Sesame Chicken and General Tso's are your standard fare. Hot and Sour soup could use more of both flavors. Broth is a little too thick - why not cut down on the corn starch and let the spice/lemongrass flavor shine? Ingredient density could be better but isn't bad.  Now the great: The Mu-Shu pork is fantastic. Nothing particularly exciting or unique, but solid execution all around. The Pancakes are the correct style, and the plum sauce included is divine. The spring rolls! Holy moly. Get a couple of these suckers, and make sure they're the shrimp variety. There's a shrimp in each one and they're positively delicious. A great starter AND desert with your meal.  Once again I can't speak to service or whatever - I will admit the waiters didn't look like they cared at all when I've walked in but the takeout food is very acceptable for SouthPark."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Chinese.  We've tried the General's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Chicken with mixed vegetables, Chicken Wings, Spring Rolls and Chicken lo Mein.  All of it has been hot, fresh and delicious every time.  We typically just get take out but have dined in a few times."}
{"text":"So I went to watch poker at the Poker Dome downtown and I ended up sitting next to the manager of Dragonfly - An Asian Joint.  When I told her that Firefly was my favorite restaurant, she explained that Dragonfly was an asian spinoff of my dearly beloved Firefly.  I'm definitely in love with Japanese food, so I thought I'd check it out.    The first time I went, I didn't think it was anything special.  I was most pleased with the \"Fried Shishito Peppers\"--mild peppers that are deep fried and topped with miso sauce.  The sushi rolls were average in taste, though some of the most beautiful creations I've seen.  I left feeling satisfied but not impressed.    I decided to give it another try and had an amazing experience.  It started with the \"Tuna Sliders\".  A hunk of delightfully seasoned and moist  tuna, between two pieces of soft bread and topped with wasabi mayonnaise.  Delicious.   After I inhaled my sliders, I asked the waiter for a suggestion.  After hearing my favorites he suggested \"Banana Leaf Salmon\"...three words that would change my life.  Okay I'm being dramatic.  But when I took the first bite of that salmon I was shocked.  Layers and layers of flavor.  Tender flakes of salmon.  Painfully soft shitake mushrooms.  I'm starting to tear up just remembering it.    So I'll admit it.  I'm in love with Dragonfly.  Equally as much as I'm in love with Firefly.  Great service, great food, and during happy hour, great prices."}
{"text":"We've gotten take-out from Dragonfly a few times and it's always been fresh and tasty. I like that their dishes have big chunks of fresh vegetables in them. Friendly service and prices are alright, too. The food is usually ready within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place, only because of the Happy Hour prices and how it is so intimate.  Ive been there only twice but both time we had a great time.  I enjoy their Vegas roll, spider roll, and all their rolls except for their 808 (it had spam), it sounded really tasty, but disappointing.  Dragonfly is a good place to hang out and get away from the crowd of the strip.  Service is a hit or miss there, just depends on how late it is."}
{"text":"SO and I hit Dragonfly last nite .....it's worth a 2nd visit.  we've been to firefly which we enjoy very much.  Dragonfly was somewhat dead ( 'tis the season ?? ) but next door, firefly was hoppin' !  SO had salmon sashimi w/ \"traditional\" topping ( you can choose from several toppings they place atop\" the sashimi ) - she liked it...i thought it was ok - the salmon felt warmer than room temp.  she also had a beef curry \"bowl\" ...they call it a bowl yet it's not served in a bowl ...the sauce could've used more curry and less coconut milk but the veggies were good - the beef....ehhhhhhh  i had the bacon wrapped quail eggs....stick to the bacon wrapped eggs next door.  the i had the tuna sliders - dare i say...they were too big ?!?!   tasty but the tuna flavor does get lost in the seasoning/sauce  i tried a couple cocktails - the sake sangria...refreshing...and a japanese vodka drink  - also refreshing  overall....i prefer firefly next door - but i want to return to try some more of the hot  \"small plates\""}
{"text":"Not your typical fast Chinese food, it's way better! I had the hot & sour soup followed by the asparagus twin delight. The asparagus was crispy, but not too hard and the flavor was excellent. I will definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Still trying to search for a Chinese go-to place near my new house. Tried Baoding which was the blandest Chinese food ever made. Tried Dragonfly-- got the General Gao Chicken, veggie lo-mein, and steamed dumplings. They were all just mediocre, nothing worth trying again. Still on the hunt for my go-to place."}
{"text":"Noticed that a lot of people that wrote bad reviews on here are the typical \"only bad reviews\" folks who think Yelp makes them a food critic. Food is good here. Service has always been great. It's a solid takeout spot."}
{"text":"Last night we ordered food from dragon fly through Foodie call. We wanted to do pick up, but the lady who was at the hostess/ cashier stand gave our food order to a driver for delivery. We understand we things get busy there is gonna be mess up, but she kept refuse to take responsibility and said its not her fault. After the food came back from the driver, the hostess refused to remake our food. They food has been out for like 40 mins in the cold air and we need to drive 20 mins back home. We had to get angry for her to remake the food. The food tasted alright but we wouldn't go back again due the service experience."}
{"text":"I've gone to Dragon Fly twice now.  Once on a blind date and once with my partner and kids.  The blind date experience was okay; thank God they have $5 martinis-of-the-day.    My return visit with my partner (not the blind date) and his kids was more enjoyable, but still nothing spectacular.  Dragon Fly offers your basic Chinese dishes that you'd find on a Chinese take-out menu, but they serve them to you in their dining room.  Good, but nothing extraordinary.  Our server wasn't very attentive until the very end when we didn't want him to be.  We were seated and brought some of those crunchy Chinese noodles with duck sauce and hot mustard sauce.  With five of us, they were gone in no time and we never did see a refill.  And I liked that they had a $5 sour apple martini drink special, but my 2nd martini didn't come until I was done eating my meal.  It kind of ruins the excitement of drinking a martini when it's served as dessert.  Well...mostly.  Toward the end of the meal (not at the end, but toward the end), our server started clearing our dishes off our table before we were even finished!   My partner had turned away for a second and someone scarfed up his plate with some food still on it.  This infuriated my partner, but I, surprisingly, wasn't as bothered.  Maybe it was because I knew that \"dessert\" was coming?    At any rate, the food is average, drink specials on martinis are great, and the service is slow, but keep an eye on your plate.  It'll disappear before your very eyes!"}
{"text":"This place makes a great backup place in case your other dinner plans fall through.  It has the standard Americanized Chinese food on the menu, but it is all very well prepared.  All the dishes are very fresh and cooked just right.  Even though it doesn't have the imagination of some other places, it makes up for it with great flavor and good service.  The pepper beef has always been a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"When dining in, seating is hit or miss.  If it's crowded at all, you get stuck at a table the waiter has to do gymnastics to get to.  The best seating is the booths, alas there are only two or three.  Take out is recommended.  Skip the Mongolian Beef, it's not spicy like it should be.  But the Kung Pao beef and General Tso's chicken are both loaded with flavor.  The pan fried pot stickers are good too."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty great. Cheap, the food tasted amazing, and the staff was super friendly. I had a big order yet they were patient and helped me work it out. I had been trying to find good Chinese food in Charlotte and I finally did! The location is awesome too"}
{"text":"One of my besties loves this place, so since it was her b-day, I treated her to lunch at DragonFly.  It was meh.  Given the price range, I would expect much better.  Next time, I'll suggest that we go to WanFu instead!"}
{"text":"My go to place since its so close. My favorite is the hot and sour soup! It is very tasty.  The \"chicken wings\" have no taste and the dipping sauce that it comes with it also has no taste. It needs flavor. Gordon Ramsey would not be pleased.   The fried rice is not greasy and I've had greasy rice especially in the areas of NYC  Just thinking about the soup makes me want it. Those fortune cookies. Worst fortunes ever! Hahaha! They have great prices and a choice of white or brown rice! Vegetable fried rice is yum. I like putting is a lot of hot mustard, hot sauce, and sweet and sour sauce in it. Delicious!"}
{"text":"So, here's a question; why are there no decent delivery Chinese restaurants in Charlotte?  When we first moved here we ordered some Chinese and my husband ordered beef & broccoli.  When it arrived it was just that.  Beef.  Broccoli.  Nothing else.  What the heck?!?  There was no sauce, nothing!  So odd.   After trying again and again to find at least a decent delivery place we found Dragonfly.  Though we have to go pick it up, it's worth it!  The food tastes and looks authentic (no mystery meat!), the prices are reasonable and it's good.  Now...if only they would deliver!!"}
{"text":"Best takeout I've had in Charlotte yet.  Wont go anywhere else.  Usually get their chicken mei fun and lo mein for my girlfriend."}
{"text":"It was okay for Chinese Food. I wasn't too impressed with Sweet and Sour Chicken had no real flavor. The Wonton wraps they used tasted stale. Though the Crab Ragoons were okay but again everything tasted like it has been store bought versus freshly made. This was evidenced by how quickly we were given our food.   It's okay and the lunch menu is a bargain but bargain shouldn't have to taste stale."}
{"text":"Really great food, always have my house special egg foo young with fried rice and also the swan special sizzling plate. Just the smell of the food tells me its authentic. Not the usual western style food like Zenfusion which i think is overrated. This place is really good and affordable a lot to choose from $10 or less entrees. Being asian myself i know what is good chinese food. I don't think their delivery is great so its either you dine in or pick up food. Also Andy our server is always great. Don't order martinis here as this is not a bar, it's a chinese resto first. If you want a drink, just get beer."}
{"text":"Imagine this: you are very hungry, having a difficult time deciding what to eat, figure it out, turns into a craving, get there, you are turned away = frustrated and put out. My husband and I decided to go to DragonFly since we had not been there in a while. One of the things that we liked about the place was that they closed at 10pm. We got there and walked in by 9:40pm (knowing that we'd arrived in the past later than that and still received good service). We were turned away!  Not a good customer service decision. DragonFly staff, I realize you want to go home, but if you advertise that you stay open until 10pm, stay open until 10pm."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive Chinese! Eggrolls and spring rolls are delish! I had the chicken and mixed veggies bc I'd like to think it's semi healthy. Only Down fall... They don't deliver! Always a good go to for take out. I'm becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Dragonfly, located in the Park Selwyn Shopping Center, is a slightly better version of a strip mall Chinese restaurant.  This has been a lunchtime favorite of mine for many years, as they are consistently good and well-priced.  My lunch on Wednesday of Sesame Chicken with fried rice and an egg roll with a sweet tea to drink was less than $9.  The portions are large without being enormous.  The Sesame Chicken is flash fried chicken in sauce and while most of it is good size chunks of white chicken, you get the odd piece stuck in there that is whatever the chicken version of gristle is (to be expected, no big).  I have also had General's chicken, beef and broccoli and veggie lo mein - all very good.    The bowl of fried noodles served when we were seated on Wednesday, along with a cup of duck sauce and one of spicy mustard, appeared to have been taken out of the bottom of the bag, as it was mostly dust, but we didn't say anything, so I can't complain (and this was the first time that has happened - generally the pieces are whole and plentiful).  The food was brought to us quickly and was hot.  The fried rice is excellent (you can also get white or brown rice) and the lunch specials are served with either an egg roll, spring roll or vegetable roll.  Dragonfly is consistently good, service is fast and friendly and the price and portions are right for lunch time."}
{"text":"I dig this spot for the pad thai, asian brew, decor, music, friendly service and the late happy hour prices. No more Jack in the Box. Tight!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place before and it was pretty good, from what I can remember.  I decided to get take out from here last night.  First, they have raised the prices, not by much- but for how much you are paying for take-out, its not worth the quality you get.  The food is not horrible, but it is just okay.  You can get much better quality Chinese for a better price.  The best thing I had was the egg roll- and I am sure this was pre-made and dropped in the fryer- so that doesn't say much.  I got the Sesame Chicken Chef's Specialty.  It was just OK, definetely not the best Ive had, no where close, but much more expensive.  Egg drop soup was also too thick and had a musty taste to it.   I would advise you to look elsewhere for your Chinese craving."}
{"text":"My 2nd Favourite Chinese Restaurant in Town.  Be sure to eat outdoors on their patio.  They have a nice outdoor fountain as well."}
{"text":"This place has great Chinese food.  I love that the menus explain exactly what comes in every dish (so you know the difference between kung pao and hunan, etc).  Everything I have tried here is good, and you have the choice of white, brown, or fried rice.  The prices are good and the portions are large.  This place is also great because they don't close between lunch and dinner like most places."}
{"text":"i thought Dragonfly offered some pretty good Chinese food. However, nothing that stood out taste-wise from the same menu across America Chinese take out places. The broccoli was a little hard. As always the General chicken taste better the next day heated up.  The presentation of the food was definitely a step up, but i wouldn't pay more simply for presentation. The rice comes in a separate bowl and there is a fancy looking food flower on the plate with the chicken. Our server provided good service, but his attitude wasn't rude, but wasn't friendly. We did use an Entertainment coupon which made it a cheap 2 entrees and one drink for around 11 bucks plus tip.    FYI, they do have a patio area if you're looking to eat outside."}
{"text":"Great Welcome at the Front Door!  They do NOT remember me... Until Today (Lunch) it has been a while... Today was my third or fourth Dine here... The Lady takes me to the Far side of the Restaurant away from the chatter so I could have some Peace and relative Quite.  She did not see the Camera yet she gave me a Table with Great lighting and asked if this Table was Alright?  It was Perfect and I said to her \"Perfecktic!!!\"   MUSTARD Sauce was soooo right, my nose ran a little bit!  Yes I licked the Bowl!  Hot though not too Hot!  The Mustard gets 4 yelp stars  My Waiter asked me some questions I asked him some:  \"What Vegetables come with the Mongolian Beef\"  he replied : \"Green Onions and White Onions unless you want to add something else\"... I said \"No that is Perfektic!  Spring Roll MUST have Been Freshly Rolled, Very Nice! 4 stars if it had been an Egg Roll... Close still for a Big Spring Roll!  Mongolian Beef better than most American \"Chinese\" places making this dish for Americans... Nice Flavor with NONE of the Vegetables I have to tell other places to leave out, which makes ordering here easier!  Quality Of Beef or the way they Cook it VERY Good! This Dish gets 4 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on a Monday night.  Good, quick American Chinese if you are looking for something filling and tasty.  Girlfriend and I split the following dishes:  Egg Drop Wonton Soup - soup for one (but big enough to share) that was strangely orange and thick and contained two somewhat chewy dumplings.  Not my favorite, but girlfriend liked it.  Chicken Wings - legs and wings deep fried in a slightly curry-flavored breading.  Very tasty! Six pieces.  Triple Delight - pork, chicken, and shrimp stir fried in a brown sauce with some leeks.  Served with rice.  Tasty, though brown sauce was a little heavy.  Only a couple shrimp.  All portions were filling. Spent $20 for the two of us.  Decent food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Horrible...worst Chinese ever. Walked in at 5:00 the place was empty. Service was poor. The food was tasteless and flavorless. We left the food on the table, paid for the egg rolls and left."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something to eat off the Strip, this isn't a bad choice.  One of the secrets to enjoying a trip to Vegas is learning about places off the Strip.  Dragonfly is next door to its sister restaurant Firefly, a fairly popular tapas restaurant with live music at night.  Dragonfly just opened a few weeks ago, and it has a lot of potential.  I do have to admit that many of the dishes were not very good, but I think given time, things will improve.  Right now though, given a choice, I'd rather go to Firefly next door.  PROS: - Lots of potential, but avoid if not interested in trying new flavors - Location is off-Strip, so it's easy to access, plus there are a number of very good restaurants in the same plaza, in case you change your mind - The Firedragon roll (shrimp tempura with spicy tuna) was fantastic - we got seconds! - The yakitori (Japanese-style skewers) are a great way to have variety and share food  CONS: - The pad thai was nothing like what I normally get - The egg roll was decent, but it was a single egg roll cut into 4 pieces (not a good value)"}
{"text":"Good quality Chinese food. Very generous portions. Haven't seen the inside of the restaurant since I ordered through foodie call, but I was pleased with the food and with the packaging!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for the rock star Todd alone!       We headed over to The Hard Rock to enjoy super late night eats. Simon and No-bu were closed. One of the guys at No-bu said that we had to go to Dragonfly.  We played and won some major $$$($60) in Penny slots, (LoL) and were on our way.      I can't tell you what it was but there was good JuJu written all over this place. It had the right balance of music and ambiance. First off,  everything was 1/2 price!!!!!!!!!  Todd mixed us up some well poured Grey goose and sodas.    We ended up ordering edamame,  swordfish belly, the Vegas roll, captain roll and some other yummy roll. It was all to die for. The swordfish was so buttery. Then Todd treated us to Hamachi with Jalapeno. WOW, the flavor was so balance and the jalapeno gave it an nice texture.  Then the rolls. Good god man! I don't really even like rolls. These were the absolute best I have ever tasted. Everything else so amazing. We finished off with more drinks and then Todd brought us a round of apple sake shots!.         The final bill $56!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  5 Grey Goose and sodas were only $20! Our penny slots paid for dinner. We had an awesome time and will definitely be back when ever we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Solid American Chinese food. Did the take-out option and got moo shu veggie with brown rice. Came with \"pancakes\" (thinner tortilla-like wrappers) to wrap the moo shu in. My order was very tasty (a bit drenched in sauce, but that's a good thing when your eating it with a bunch of rice), and the portion was huge, been able to stretch it into 3 meals. Also got to try the lo mein which was good with broccoli and baby corn. Vegetables are fresh, didn't taste msg-ed up, and everything was cooked decently.   Waitress was friendly, decor was nice and modern (will have to do a dine in experience one of these days), and take out was ready in 10 minutes!  Def one of the better American Chinese food restaurants I've had in the QC!"}
{"text":"Food: Food super greasy and I felt was damaging my health.  My friend ordered hers and did not get noodles with her lo-mein, by the time we came home with our take out order.    Location: located in a shopping center next to Harris Teeter.    Perks: opens on a major holiday when everything else was closed.   Overall, I would not come back...  I knew it was too good to be true to order Chinese food from here. Gah!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had my whole family in town and we made a takeout order for 18 people. The owners were very helpful and patient in taking our order, making sure we had enough food for everyone, reviewing it thousands of times and then splitting it all between 7 different cards. Not to mention that the food is absolutely amazing. Their spring and vegetable rolls are the best I've had and their orange chicken is out of this world. Overall, great experience and great service."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for happy hour.  The beers were pretty cheap, and the food wasn't bad at all.  There weren't many people here though.  They were all next door at Firefly's.  The place isn't big, but the service was really good.  Probably for the fact that there weren't many people in there.  Nice place for a happy hour menu though."}
{"text":"went to Vegas last weekend for training.  my cousin recommended goin to Firefly and stressed on how good it was...  so we headed that way.  i was hungry.  hardly ate anything all day.  training classes from 8 to 6 with only 30 min breaks in between hour and a half  classes.  had coffee for breakfast, and a nasty spring roll from a cheap ass wanna-be asian food place at the riviera.  i was starving.  we get to firefly and the place is packed.  we were told it would be a 20 -25 minute wait.  my stomach growled at me in anger.  20 - 25 minutes????  i just might pass out during that time.    so next door was a different kind of fly.... dragonfly...an asian joint.  we proceeded to check out the menu posted on the window.  as we were doing that, one of the servers came out and assured us it was really good in there.  they enticed us with an available table right at that very moment.  the place looked pretty cool inside.  not too big.  one small bar in the corner.  cool dragonfly decor on the walls.  some kind of anime porn projecting against the wall... that was interesting.    the service was good.  our server was actually really nice and very helpful.  i had a raspberry margarita.  it wasn't too bad.  they had a pretty big selection on the drink menu.  i started with a miso soup which was actually not too bad..  i then had a volcano roll and it was... eh... ok.  portions for very small, and not very cheap.  and i was still hungry.  so my friend and i decided to split a sampler with some rice.  (we're so Filipino. )  probably not a good idea since the beef was pretty much raw, the chicken was too salty, and the meatballs were too mushy...  overall the food was eh.  next time i'm waiting for firefly."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Perfect portions, amazing prices. Good quality authentic, quick \"American\" Chinese.  Chicken and broccoli is where it's at! Crab rangoons were also on point."}
{"text":"Like many of the other yelpers, i went to dragonfly looking for quality local cuisine. I was sadly disappointed. i wanted to like Dragonfly. but it was dismal. the service was slow, I've had better Chinese from the Harris Teeter Frozen food section for a much lower price point.   The decor seemed nice, until you look at the walls: The paint is peeling, and there is a railing separating the platformed section completely blocking off the bathrooms not making it very accessable.  Like i said i wanted to like Dragonfly. Sadly it won't happen."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese places in Charlotte! Well priced, always fast and convienant. Fresh and tasty, does not disappoint, consistent"}
{"text":"This place  was pretty good.  It has a nice atmosphere if you decide to sit in or outside.  It has a dynamic menu  I suggest trying something on the chef's special.  The chicken and shrimp special was good, not the greatest I've ever had, but still really good.  The service was great, and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food is great.  It's my go to for chinese. The crab rangoons, pot stickers and hot and sour soup are all great. They give you the little fried things to dip in sweet and sour sauce. I usually get Ho Fun but this last time, they changed the noodles from extremely wide to almost like Pad Thai noodles. It was a disapoint but was still okay.   the restaurant is usually quiet and  clean. Service is always great. There is convienent parking although getting out of the plaza can be difficult if  you are trying to go left."}
{"text":"We recently moved up the street from DragonFly, and we love to order Chinese takeout. So we, naturally, were searching for a new quick Chinese restaurant. Tried DragonFly. About 4 times, to be exact. The last time we did, my son and I informed my husband that we didn't want to order from DragonFly anymore. (My husband is pretty easy to please, so he was surprised we didn't like it). The chicken has a strange texture, according to my son. I always ordered the King Tofu, which was decent, but overpriced and tasted chock full of msg, lard and other stuff that's not good for you. Their wonton soup is pretty good, however. I think it's worth the extra five-minute drive to go to Vietnam Grille a couple miles away, where the food is authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Really, not good.    Flavors aren't bad, but chicken meat in sweet & sour chicken seems tenderized and gives you the -you know what's-.  The shrimp is frozen and not great.  Noodles are chewy, but not in a good way.  Egg drop soup tasted weird and probably contributed to the -you know what's.  Egg roll has very little meat in it, which was probably a good thing.  Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Good food, typical chinese. Average prices. The lady working was very nice. New to the area and will probably try a few others but will return."}
{"text":"The food was so gross! It was greasy and very bland. I very disappointed because the reviews were so generous but I will not go back. Plus their sanitation score was 91.5! Way too low."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a shopping center hosting a number of restaurants including the wildly popular Firefly which shares the same ownership as the Dragonfly.  Unfortunately the Asian bistro concept has fallen on deaf wallets and, other than a few people at the bar; the restaurant was empty at 8:40PM this Monday evening.  In contrast, it was standing room only over at the Firefly.  My wifeordered a Thai beef salad with pickled cucumber in a warm spicy sauce which was excellent.  I ordered the banana leaf salmon steamed with miso and shitake mushrooms.  The Atlantic salmon was very good, but it obviously had not been steamed in the banana leaf which was cold to the touch.  A very good side dish of baby bok choy stir fried with oyster mushrooms was shared."}
{"text":"Yea so I was drunk hungry coming here after the Jet concert at the Hard Rock pool. It was Firefly? or Dragonfly? Dragonfly had less people. It was loud inside with their resident dj spinning. I was HAWNGRY! So I ended up with a taste of everything. Tempura was great - It was different from regular because they had potato tempura and firm tofu tempura. The sauce that came with it was slightly thicker than your normal Tempura sauce.  The chicken fried rice was good too. Nothing fancy. I kinda wish it was bigger for the cost of it.  Veggie curry was pretty good.with shitake and tofu balanced with a coconut and curry sauce. It was well complimented with the Jasmine rice. Pad thai a lil saucy, strong flavor. Good but overwhelming in flavors.  The tuna sliders were definitely tasty! The tuna was moist with the carmelized onion and Lychee ketchup.  They have your standard sushi menu. The service was slow because they were understaffed. I would go back again. But Firefly would still be first choice!"}
{"text":"err... i went here cuz there was a wait for firefly. i wish i had waited. it wasn't bad.. just ok. i won't come back knowing firefly is just a few steps away.  we started with the thai beef salad. we haaad to get it cuz it had kobe beef. it just sounded yummmmy. it wasn't. very bland.. the lime chili dressing had no flavor. in fact.. almost everything was bland. the beef had very little seasoning.  what a disappointment.  next we had the yellowtail with ponzu sauce and jalapeno and i forget what else. this was actually better than the version they have at kona grill. the fish was fresh and the sauce was savory. the sliced jalapeno added a nice crunch and the chili sauce added a nice zing. i didnt like the one at kona grill but dragonfly's was delish...  i had the crispy dragon roll. shrimp tempura with crab avocado and eel. it was like any other roll you'd have. nothing special.   followed that with the tuna dynamite. a cream sauce with crispy wonton wrap and avocado. i couldnt taste anything. nothing at all. my friend agreed.. she tried dipping it in soy sauce and chili and then it was just ok.   we started off drinks with the lychee sake. very tasty. then i tried the sochu soda with orange. it tasted like they put one squeeze of orange juice in a glass of ice.. let it melt.. then added club soda.   our server noticed i barely touched the tuna dynamite and asked if i wanted anything else.. i declined since i was so disappointed with everything else. when we asked for the check he told us he took the tuna dynamite off since we didnt like it. that was so nice of him. kudos for that.. ok.. i'm done"}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Firefly which is right next door. I recommend the happy hour. Sit at the bar, talk to the awesome bartender Aaron, and eat cheap, delicious sushi.  Beware: It is in a strip mall and the parking lot gets crazy, stupid, busy."}
{"text":"Great food for about $12-$15 for dinner and $8 or so for lunch. Seriously nice presentation and service.   I had the Hibachi style shrimp which came with fresh broccoli and rice - the shrimp were plump and the sauce was light and delicious.  They don't heat the plates so the good cools a bit quickly but other than that it's really very good.  As you may already know I'm a booth girl ... There are cozy booths and tables too so you can enjoy a group of your friends and family.  There's an outdoor terrace and the tables look out onto it. Portions are generous but not over the top.  This is a reasonably priced and modest place ... Unless you're expecting the Beverly Hills Country Club with its brunch buffet ice sculptures, you'll have a nice time ."}
{"text":"My favorite local Chinese restaurant. Fast, friendly service. Good sized portions. Always really fresh tasting. The best hot and sour soup I've had. Good selections and reasonable prices. I just wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"Close, convenient, and good food!!   Protesting my duties to cook dinner tonight, I thought that Chinese food would be in order to feed myself and my hungry hubs. I wanted some good old fashion Chinese food and hit up yelp for a place close to my house. I could have picked another popular food chain that's two steps from my door, but I didn't. I wanted to try something different!!   Dragon Fly was clean with a nice interior. Place was rather slow and not full of customers, but service was awesome. Hostess was nice and food came out nice and hot.   was great for what I was looking for. My belly and hubs are both happy."}
{"text":"Just moved into town right  outside of the strip and stumbled across this place by accident and has been by far the best find yet in Vegas (its only been 3 days)  The atmosphere was very tame compared to its partnering neighbor Firefly, but I wasn't looking to get busy on the dance floor Sunday night. When we went to order we were told that everything on the menu was half off (happy hour 10:30PM-2:00 AM) That really made this place worth the stop.  Pretty much everything on the menu was share plate which was cool because we like to try different things. The food presentation was great (i posted some pictures). We started with yellow tail sashimi and the ceviche trio.  We also had two en trees and shared a desert. When were finished the bill was like 23 bucks and we were completely satisfied. I recommend anyone here for the happy hour pricing, I think it would be pointless to go any other time since it is Las Vegas. I know this will be one of my favorite places to bring friends especially the ones who don't like to pay.  Dragonfly - the best share plate deal I have ever had"}
{"text":"Truly excellent chinese food. These kind of places make me never want to go to places like Panda Express.... This place is sooooooooo good and you get a lot of food for your money!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok.  Nice decor but its always dead when I walk by here while going into Firefly.  So my wife and I call this place Deadfly cuz no one is ever in there when we walk by.  We only ate here once.  The food was alright.  Nothing to write home about.  Sushi was comparable to Makino but more expensive.  I did enjoy the fact that they has Orion beer (okinawan beer) which is great but pricey.  I'd rather just go to Ichiza any day of the week."}
{"text":"Honestly a 2.5, but I am going with a two based on the service and smells I endured during my visit. Upon arriving on New Year's Day, around 11:30, there was only one other table dining in the restaurant. Immediately I noticed a strange smell, almost urine smell, which was very discouraging. I was seated and noticed the booth seats were torn, and didn't even up to the table.  With that said, I decided to give it a chance and chose to order the shrimp with mixed vegetables lunch combo with a spring roll and fried rice, with a cup of wonton soup. I was brought egg drop soup, which tasted horrible, so after 10 minutes of trying to flag down my waiter, who was on his cell phone in the back of the restaurant, I expressed that I received the wrong soup. He brought the wonton soup, which was just okay, but before I even had a chance to enjoy it my lunch was delivered. The spring roll was not cooked, very doughy and bland. As for the shrimp with vegetables, very good and a nice lunch portion. The fried rice was decent, but was basically brown rice fried, one one sliver of egg and one carrot, a little disappointing. And, the most upsetting part was my waiter was MIA the entire time, and when he did stop by he smelled of smoke. I get employees need breaks, but it is not too attractive when they smell like a smoke stack, especially when handling food.  Honestly, not sure I will arrive anytime soon."}
{"text":"In my quest to try restaurants I've lived around for years, tonight's journey took me to DragonFly.    Keep in mind that I am normally a Chinese Food snob and there are only two such restaurants in Charlotte that I consider good and worth going back to.  So DragonFly had high expectations to live up to.  I also checked the other reviews here on Yelp and they seemed worthy.  But, alas, I came away disappointed.  First off, the place was dead.  When I arrived there was only one table occupied.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere but the music playing tonight was enough to put anyone to sleep.  I was seated by a window facing the fountains at Park road which I enjoyed watching.  I received the complimentary fried chinese noodles with hot mustard and duck sauces.  The hot mustard cleared my sinuses and it was probably the most flavorful thing I ate here.     They were out of my first beer request, Asahi so I settled for the Ichiban.  Not bad but I was stuck on the Asahi,  For dinner I ordered the house salad with ginger dressing and Hunan Chicken.  The salad came out and It looked like an orange glob on top of iceberg lettuce.  The tomatoes looked and tasted like they were frozen before and had a gritty texture to them.  The Hunan Chicken came out and it looked good.  But it had absolutely no flavor except for a little spice. The broccoli was also overcooked.    And if that's not enough, I thought they were overpriced. Must be to cover the cost of the location  I would imagine rent isn't cheap there.  Anyway, the moral of this story...Don't stray from the good Chinese places in town.  You will likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"Didn't blow my mind but was VERY good. I got the general tso chicken with rice and an egg roll on the lunch special for $7. Can't beat it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"THE ORDER: Yaki Platter - 3 Grilled Skewers                          Pork Shoulder, Chicken Tempura, Filet Mignon Swordfish belly w. spicy miso Filet roll (sorry forgot name) Kirin light - on tap  YIPPEEE: Chicken tempura - an elegant light and crispy chicken finger  BOOO: Filet roll - the mayonish sauce overpowered the other ingredients Make reservations - very busy"}
