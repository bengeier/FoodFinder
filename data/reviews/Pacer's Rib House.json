{"text":"The food is bad and the service is poor. The waitress constantly forgot things. I went there 3 times and saw the same waitress before I decided to post a review. the first time, I ordered a chicken cajun sandwich and there was nothing cajun about it. Not only was there nothing cajun about it but the chicken looked like it had been rolled on the floor. and strangely enough,  it was in the shape of a boomerang (?). Another time, I got wings and they came in a puddle of oil. I ate 2 bites before I felt an upset stomach coming. I've been there 3 times now and the food has been terrible all 3 times. The beer was good though, but that is because beer is standard. I would only go there to drink."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. Do not EVER go here for lunch. Waitress got every order wrong. She gave a burger to someone and he started eating bacon off of it and then came back and took it from him saying it wasn't his burger. She then wound up giving that exact same burger to another person at our table (missing the bacon). She gave me the wrong food and also lied to me about no up charge for Onion Rings. The waitress took forever to do everything. The total time spent there was about 1 hour and 45 minutes! I will never be returning to Pacers again."}
{"text":"Has turned seedy, when it was Scorchers (sp?) it was much nicer. Bartender tonight lead the swearing challenge (fake contest). I'm sure the menu is still fine and the beer was cold. I'll keep coming here for layovers but would not stop if I was passing through."}
{"text":"Beers Beers. Plenty of them. Bar at the reserve square. The crowd can be sketchy at times. Typical bar food."}
{"text":"This sports bar is located in the Embassy Suites Tower.  It has your usual deep fried sports bar types of foods.  I ordered the chicken tenders, wings and mozzarella sticks and they were everything i was expecting, greasy fried goodness.  There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that its seems like more of a bar that serves food rather than vice versa.  its a great place to just relax and drink a few brews if you're in or around the hotel.  I've had better, but this place was the only thing open late night in the area and desperate times call for desperate measures.  Good frozen fried eating."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in downtown cleveland! Monday night is pizza night! Greg is a great bartender too! Definitely worth stopping by :)"}
