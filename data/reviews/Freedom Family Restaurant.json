{"text":"Great staff !! The food is okay.Had worst, had better. I would say it's a good option if you are around looking for somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is shutting down! One of Charlotte's Best Kept Secrets. Just discovered it less than 6 months ago and got addicted instantly. Love the food, the staff and the LOW prices! Sad to see you go but it's been good while it lasted. Hope you find a new location and reopen"}
{"text":"Stopped here with the family on a road trip from Charlotte to Asheville. It sounded great based on other reviews, but I'm not sure what those people ate that I didn't. 

The grits were the worst I've ever had. Basically lumpy water, and not seasoned at all. In fact, nothing was seasoned. My omelette had a lot of great veggies, but it needed lots of salt and pepper. The blueberry pancakes were actually pretty good. 

One really nice thing about the restaurant is the service. We were met with lots of southern hospitality and friendly servers, and they even brought us some complementary livermush when we asked what it was."}
{"text":"Decent and reasonable family style restaurant.  Lunch fare offered subs, sandwiches, burgers, and entree's, along with a special lunch menu that for $5.95 comes with french fries and coffee or tea.  Good selection of food, cheap prices, and fair service.  Nothing fancy, but it's not presented that way either.  I had the freedom sub, which was turkey, bacon, and roast beef with french fries.  Free refills on soda too - actually have run into two places recently that don't, so I figured I'd mention it."}
{"text":"We picked up some Broasted Chicken for lunch one day.. It's really hard to find broasted chicken anywhere!!! I was really satisfied with the taste and the price of their meals, but their sides/veggies, well, they need a few more options other than fries, cole slaw, pickled beets... Maybe some corn, green beans, baked beans, etc... The chicken orzo soup was very good, but their cream of broccoli was missing something...?! Maybe cheese? The fries were very good! 

But I will DEFINITELY go back for the chicken!!! The prices can't be beat. And the fact it's broasted and NOT FRIED, is awesome!! If you've never had broasted, you've got to try it!!! 

Oh, we also ordered the kids fried flounder. We didn't realize it came as a sandwich, so my daughter wouldn't eat it - she's picky! But wow!! It was enormous for a kids meal!!  We got two chicken dinners that came with 2 sides, and soup, and kids meal w/ drink... And it was under $20! Not bad considering you can spend over that at McD's and it's nothing special. And despite everyone loving McD's fries, I hate them, so it's not worth me going there! I'd much rather spend my money here any day!! Plus the people were extremely nice!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a late breakfast.

This side of town has probably seen some better days but Freedom Family seems to be holding on because they had great prices and the food was pretty good.

The place was clean a little warmer that I'm used to but it wasn't uncomfortable.  Friends brought us here and the staff was hilarious.  They were joking around with us especially since I was very specific on how I wanted my bologna cooked.  Which was done exactly as asked.  

The \"owner\" sat down at the table next to us just as friendly as could be.  Our server was definitely explaining that the \"westside\" of Charlotte had seen some better days but if you stay there long enough they'll definitely get revived."}
{"text":"This place is alright!
The food was good.
My sandwich was tasty.
The service was very friendly and I left with a smile."}
{"text":"I'm a little hooked in this place. It's great because it's fast and cheap. Plus everyone that works there are so nice. I eat here for work lunch, and even on a time crunch but don't want fast food, this is the place."}
