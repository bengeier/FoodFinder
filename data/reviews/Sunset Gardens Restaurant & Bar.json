{"text":"Went in at lunchtime mid-week. I was greeted by an angry-looking woman who seemed not to enjoy being disturbed at work. I bought a passable (but small) roti and a drink.  Really, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I live near here, and most nights the music is blaring out their front door until midnight or later. Drunken patrons stumble around the parking lot, sometimes with drinks in their hands. I've personally witnessed a few using the parking lot as their bathroom. I've seen cases of beer being ferried to an adjacent parking lot and surreptitiously placed in the trunks of waiting cars.  And so I just wanted to see if the crappy neighbors actually serve decent food.  The answer is, \"Meh.\""}

{"text":"Are used to go to Caribbean sunset a lot, before became sunset garden. I feel very conflicted with this place because the food is really good. On the other hand the service is really bad.   I went in one night for their appetizer specials. Ordered a bunch about $60 but the special was half off.   Upon receiving my bill I got no discount. The owner an older lady advise me that I did not buy a bucket of beer which was required to get the 50% off. Her son was my waiter and had mentioned nothing about the beer also up selling me at the fact that it was 50% off.   She had this advertised nowhere after speaking with a few people in the industry I came to realize that this was a common occurrence that they bait and switch customers.   I paid the bill never to return again."}
