{"text":"Went here today for brunch because the bf is a beer nut and wanted to try the beers brewed by an ex-dogfish brewer.  Got seated promptly and got a great outdoor seat.  I enjoyed the reclaimed wood decor through out the restaurant.  Beer selection was fantastic. I ended up with the white egg and feta omelet.  Yummy but the highlight of the meal were the tasty crispy home fries.  Definitely memorable food worth of a return trip!"}
{"text":"Beer is awesome. Service is super slow. Great place though for good beer and food. Just have to be patient."}
{"text":"The atmosphere outstrips the food and brew by a Wide margin here. Tveekram, if he's still at the helm of the brewery has clearly fallen asleep. The beers nearly all taste bland, lifeless and one dimensional; nothing like the kind he brewed at GLBC during the golden years or what we expect given his 'street cred' as developed at Dogfishhead. What has happened?  The food was clearly created from quality ingredients, but like the brew it somehow ended up bland, spice-less and flavorless - not what we expect given these owners' resume and past success.  The patio area, fireplace, its proximity to one of our fair city's gems, the WSM and the quality server staff alone give this joint 2 of its 3 stars today.  I'm sure someone will suggest it again as a destination, but I won' t do so myself."}
{"text":"I write this review as someone who isn't into beer, so take that into account. Like many of my fellow reviewers, I thought this MGB had a cool space; you wouldn't find it out of place transported to San Francisco or Chicago.  I went there with a group of friends in December; we were there at about 6P and it wasn't too crowded or too loud. As mentioned, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but most of my friends were, and while the selection was pretty good, we were disappointed by the server, who didn't seem to be able to answer some pretty basic questions about the different varieties. I don't think I'm alone in believing the staff at a brewery should be able to talk about the different beers and how they compare to each other.  Another disappointment was the fact that they didn't have any happy hour specials. For a place that's relatively new and trying to make a reputation, why not offer a few discounts to promote your home brews and bring novices in the door?  I'm also in agreement with those fellow reviewers who were blase about the food.  Since I wasn't imbibing, I had been hoping for some great grub. I was disappointed at the uninspired menu, and the prices, which would have been more appropriate for those aforementioned Chicago of SF locations. The food we ordered was fine, but nothing special, and barely memorable.   The one real plus I can point to was that at one point the manager came by our table and offered us a plate of free soft  pretzels, which came with fresh mustard & garlic cheese spread. He said that the kitchen had accidentally made one order too many, and asked if we'd care to eat it. The gesture was great, but again, the dish wasn't interesting enough for a group of six of us to to finish it.  I won't make any effort to go back, but if I'm with a group that is going there, I wouldn't put up a fuss about it. Try the place for yourself if you're so inclined, but it's nothing special from my perspective."}
{"text":"Come here at shift change to watch every staff member hug and talk about all of the weed they just smoked and ignore you for 20 minutes to get a mediocre cocktail. Worst service in Ohio city."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to market Garden Brewery. It was recommended by our close friends and we ad went a few months ago for a birthday dinner and I would say that our first experience was pretty good from the service to he beer to the food. Unfortunately, we could not say that about our trip last night. We have family in from out of town and wanted to show off this restaurant..Which we felt terrible for recommended a \"ok\" place. My husband and I are foodies and I would NOT recommend coming here for the food. THey have a wonderful selection of beer., but food not so much. We were seated sooner then the expected wait of an hour, cool. Our waiter took our drink order but didn't get our food order for greater than 20 minutes after we had ordered our drinks. We believe this was due to a very large party of 20 or more. One of the wait staff came over and asked if our appetizer was good  and if she could get us anything else, and I replied \"Yes,. our order\" The service was not the greatest- but I am attributing to the large party behind us who got there after we did and had their ordered placed before us- frustrating. I ordered the mac and cheese- which sounded delicious- and I was very disappointed- so much so that I will never go back again. It had no flavor whats over and I hate to say it, but Kraft's mac and cheese is rated well above this watery, flavorless dish.   Overall, the out of town guests I think were happy- Wished we would have eaten at Great Lakes- we have eaten there and everything from service, to food is much better. Spend your money else where!"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place.  I just don't know.  I've been here multiple times and I've never had a bad experience, but I've never had anything to write home(or yelp) about either.  It bothers me that they only have beers that they make there, which, I suppose, wouldn't bother me if any of them were any good.  Trust this is a strong point coming from me.  I have never had one that made me say \"Wow! I'm sure glad I'm not across the street drinking a Chimay right now!\"  They do have some tasty cocktails, but when I go into a brewery I want beer.  They do this cutesy thing where you can order your beer in a mason jar-because nothing says class(or alcoholism) like drinking out of a mason jar, RIGHT!?- but you can only pick from the low percentage beers.  The patio is great, no one can deny that.  The inside is all dark wood, reminiscent of bier market.  The food is OK.  I really liked the meat board with the chicken liver pate and their fried chicken is pretty decent as well.  I'd say check it out and see for yourselves.  That expression one man's trash is another man's treasure might just apply in this case."}
{"text":"My organization recently held an event for 25-30 people at Market Garden and the team there did an excellent job. The atmosphere at Market Garden and the space worked very well for us, the dedicated and closed off space provided us the environment we needed to get our meeting business taken care of during our event. Market Garden did excellent throughout the planning of our event, communicating promptly and thoroughly, and they were well prepared for the evening. We were provided excellent service, attention, and accommodation during the evening and the food and beer were great and enjoyed by the whole group. We will definitely be considering having future events at Market Garden!"}
{"text":"Small menu, but my salmon was delicious! The service was great; friendly and attentive. We love the huge fireplace on the outdoor patio'"}
{"text":"Tacos and peirogies are delicious.  Not a beer drinker so I can't attest to what they have on tap.  They are a bit pricey, but the food I had was pretty tasty.  I'd definitely go back, probably not too often, though.  It gets WAY too packed in there on weekends, and as a result the service suffers a bit."}
{"text":"Great place, always packed and packed with a great atmosphere. Any type of perogie is a good choice along with the tacos too. I wouldn't say this is a place to go and eat a full dinner but a wonderful stop during your night for appetizers. Service is quick, waitresses polite and flirtatious and overall a great place to go."}
{"text":"I wanna hate it for its too cool for school atmosphere but it was very good. The patrons look like prep school trust fund hipsters, and the staff sometimes seem annoyed you are alive, but the beer/drinks where great."}
{"text":"We stumbled in to MGB on a whim after having a flight at GLBC across the street.  They have flights of 6 for one person or flights of 12 for two people.  They had 9 beers on tap and we were able to get a flight of 18 to split between two people so that we could sample all of the offerings.  I like the philosophy of focusing on session beers.  You can come down and try all of the brews without getting too drunk. We were there the first day it was open, and the Pilsner and the ESB were not ready yet.  The other beers were all quality.   My highlights were the Pearl Street Wheat, The Scotch Ale (I scored beer nerd points when I said it was more of a Scottish Ale which was confirmed by the Brewmaster when he came by to talk with us) and the Brown Ale.  We didn't get to try the food, but the waitress brought us a variety of pickled vegetables which they pickle in-house.  Everyone was nice and very attentive,  It was very cool to actually get to talk w/ the brewmaster and ask questions. It is a great location next to  The West Side Market, and the outdoor deck is great. They have a big fireplace and apparently they will have some heat lamps in the winter time to keep the outdoor dining as an option.  Highly enjoyable and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great beer flights! I love the selection and how you can get different numbers of beers.  As for food, I got their PBLT (pork belly) sandwich, with a large serving of fries. My boyfriend got the pork chop, he enjoyed it. I felt like it was a little to sweet for my taste. Everyone has their own preference though!  I like how the place is really big, so I will definitely come back with a group of friends for a birthday or a big get-together for drinks and food."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite spot since I moved up here to Ohio. The food is good the beer Is awesome. I always get the pearl street wheat ale when come here."}
{"text":"Again. Wanted to grab one of the open tables. This time they said it was a 30 minute wait. There was absolutely no one waiting in line. This is Cleveland folks. Get the customer service right."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, tasty beer, food was underwhelming. We were seated quickly on a busy Sat. night during March madness. Quick friendly service. We enjoyed the cheese and antipasti app but the main course was pretty forgettable. My beet salad was drenched in dressing and my husband's burger was overcooked and served with a stale bun."}
{"text":"For beer: a sound choice, with a variety of quality house brews. No reason to order Bud Light here (I say people doing just that, sad to say). Excellent service by bar staff (sit at the bar!).  For dining: left my cell phone number for my 45-60 min wait, no call in 1:15 so went to the hostess stand; they insisted they had called. Showed them my incoming call list that they weren't on; dumb hostess girl shrugged her shoulders and insisted they had called, again showed them the phone and explained I was not sure who they had called but it wasn't me. Asked to speak with manager, explained I was unhappy with situation and hostess' response, he said 'sorry' and shrugged his shoulders; no offer of free app or other effort to compensate an annoyed customer. A nice waitress came over to take our order; explained our situation, and that our mood was spoiled by rude hostess and clueless manager.  Left, went to one of the 25-30 other restaurants within walking distance, and will not be back; see no reason to reward poor service at the front of the house."}
{"text":"I'm an Ohio City resident and for the most part enjoy the local bars and restaurants. I will NEVER recommend Market Garden Brewery for food. Today is my first  (and last) visit. It was understandably busy and yes, I've been a server and understand how it goes when you're overworked and under staffed. We waited ten minutes for our drink orders to be taken, then another 15 for our food order. I had two drinks, the first was so weak and watered down that I had to add another shot of booze just to make it drinkable....and they charged me for it. The burger and fries my daughter ordered was ok except for the mouthful of salt you got with every bite. I ordered the skirt steak tacos...they were decent except for the side of canellini bean 'salsa'. The beans were undercooked and pretty gross and of course everything was cold. The total came to  $51, and I managed to find it in my heart to leave a  $4 tip. My usual is at least 20% but I just couldn't do it. Bad servers need to know they're bad servers or they'll stay and screw up more orders. Oh, and the glass my second drink came in was completely filthy and when I asked for a clean one I got a major attitude. Like I said, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Beer? Good. Food? Good. We went here tonight while hoping around the neighborhood, and it was decently busy. We were seated at a table, then 15 minutes later, asked to move to a table further back into the back, because they needed the table for \"a larger party\". We moved without thinking twice, it wasn't a problem. Until we sat at our new table for 30 minutes before anyone was seated where we were. I'm still not sure why we were moved, and it sucked not being able to see the TVs on a college football Saturday. Not an apology, nothing. We paid and left. Don't go when it's busy, they'll probably herd you into the back."}
{"text":"Great service, food and beer. We stopped in on our first night in Cleveland during a Cavs championship game, the place was mobbed, but the staff was still friendly. We had one beer and decided to take our food to go. The burger and eggplant sandwich were both great. On our last afternoon in town we stopped by for lunch, again great beer we shared a scotch egg it was really good. We decided on the pierogi and kielbasa, it is an old childhood favorite that the Market Garden Brewery made better!"}
{"text":"The service was great when we were there, the food was well prepared and the beers were good.  The downside?  The food is a bit unfocused.  After a certain point of piling fancy stuff into a dish, it becomes indistinguishable from a plate of food from Denny's (nothing against Denny's, just that Denny's is half the price).  As well, the four sample beers that I ordered all tasted like variations of saison beer, which happens to be my favorite, so no harm no foul!"}
{"text":"The beer here is beyond excellent, but the food is another story... every time we come here we order something different and its disappointing,  Today it was the sauerkraut balls, overdone on the outside and cold on the inside!!!  We have been coming here since they opened at the food had just gone downhill, beyond disappointed..... let the bartender know and they just looked at me??? Good thing the beer is great!"}
{"text":"Not bad, They were weird about turning on the sound for the USA World Cup match, but conceded eventually.  Definitely in need of a gluten free menu, or at least knowledge of what is in their food and beer.   Celiacs disease is on the rise, adding GF options isn't hard.  Was surprised at the kids in the bar.    Would not be my first choice again with so many other (read better) options on W 25th!"}
{"text":"Good selection but can't hold a candle to the neighbors"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time last night. Great food. Great service. Hugh place to hang out with a bunch of friends. Nice patio. I recommend this place for any type of beer drinker."}
{"text":"I really like this place!   The beer is tasty, the food is pretty good, the service is good, the atmosphere is fun, and the space is amazing!  The Beer - I've been to Market Garden twice and enjoyed a couple of the brews.  The Pearl Street Double Wheat is refreshing, very tasty and, thanks to it's 8% ABV, sneaks up on you if you're not paying attention.  The Forest City Brown Ale is also very tasty.  Malty, dark, but not too bitter nor heavy.  You could easily have 4-5 pints and not feel full or bloated as you could with other dark beers.    The Food - On my two trips, I enjoyed the food very much.  It's good, not great, but very tasty.  I've had the Currywurst, which, for those of you not lucky enough to be German, is a plate of (very tasty) fries, with a tasty bratwurst cut into slices and placed atop the fries.  Then, the whole thing is covered in a house-made tomato-based red curry sauce.  It's a staple of pub grub in Germany, and MGB does a pretty darn good version.    I also had one of their Scotch Eggs, which, was pretty good, but 2 improvements would make it great!  First, Scotch Eggs are rolled in breadcrumbs and deep fried.  MGB's version is not breaded and is cooked on the flattop grill.  Second, while I love Stadium Mustard, it really should be served with Coleman's English Mustard.  It didn't stop me from eating it, mind you...just was expecting a traditional Scotch Egg.  The Service - Both visits to MGB we had great servers!  Friendly, offering solid drink advice.  They were very knowledgeable about the beers and offered some pairing suggestions with out meals.  The bartenders were also very friendly, offering suggestions and kept my glass full!    The Space - The layout of the MGB is initially deceiving.  From the street, it looks like a nice medium-sized storefront pub.  Then, you walk in and turn to your left and see this huge space that goes a loooong way back.  As you walk back, you quickly notice the huge patio that looks out onto the vegetable stalls of the West Side Market.  And then, as you walk back towards the restrooms, you notice the stairs to the basement, leading to another huge dining space and bar.    I am a big fan of the Market Garden Brewery.  I've heard that the owners are trying to get brewers down there with them and Great Lakes to turn the area in to a \"Cleveland Brewery District,\" as in the days of yore.  Let's all hope that this is a dream that comes true."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish it wasn't the dead of Winter when I visited! The patio looks epic...but alas, mother nature is a monstrous beast.  While we weren't here very long, the way the bring out the beer was pretty neat. For $8 you can get it in a cool Growler and then fill it up with any beer for around $15-20. Pricey, but insanely unique.  It is very spacious inside, but that may have been because it was a Sunday, so not too many people....but enough of us Ohio State fans to keep the place nutty!  I would love to come back to comment on the food selections, but from previous reviews, it doesn't seem like much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Our bar tender Dan was amazing, he told us so much info about Cleveland and was so friendly! If you can, definitely come here. It's not too loud, but you can still have an awesome time. And they really know how to pour a beer! Finally, a beer with some head!!!!! Excellent place and amazing staff! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bland bland bland. Sad food. Descriptions do not fit the actual product. This place only exists thanks to a 1.5 hour wait at Townhall. Do not do it. If you can't get into Townhall just go home and try again another day."}
{"text":"Six of us went to Market Garden Brewery for dinner yesterday.   The interior is nice and the staff was very friendly.   But....the service was very, very slow and the food was not all that good.   The portions were small in comparison to other restaurants of the same caliber.   We had tortilla chips and salsa.   One salsa (green) was okay.   The other salsa (red) was not very good.   The best anyone could say is that it was wet.   We also ordered the meat platter.   They say you eat first with your eyes.   To eat this mess, you should keep your eyes closed.   Not visually appealing.   Not very good at all.  They should call it the mess platter.  We then placed our entree orders and waited almost 45 minutes to receive our food.   Two other tables who ordered after we did received their meals before we did.   And since the menu is very limited, nothing should take that long to prepare.   Probably the item that would require the most time was a pork chop.   I ordered the fish and it was luke warm to cold.   Others complained their food was not hot.   But since we had waited so long, they decided to eat and not complain.   I sent my food back and waited another 10 minutes.   I finally had to flag down the waitress to ask about my meal.  The wait staff seems a bit overwhelmed or worse yet, incompetent.   There wasn't much attention paid to customers.   No one asked how our meal was.   That was probably a good thing.   This was my first time and in all likelihood my last time.   I would NOT recommend this restaurant.   Spend your money where you can receive a better value in return."}
{"text":"We ate at the Market Garden for the first and last time a couple days ago. It took almost 30 min. to get someone to write down our order, and an hour to get our food! The cauliflower gratin was overpriced and greasy, the side 'salad' was a joke and the chicken tacos my husband ordered were very spicy but not very tasty. Will not return..."}
{"text":"I like this bar. They have a good beer selection and bring different beers in on almost a weekly bais. The food is good alittle small but for the most part will do the job for a saturday night dinner. They have two full size bars with an outside patio and a fireplace. Good spot to take someone to dinner or just have some drinks. Good service good times."}
{"text":"For the beer consumer it is a great destination and atmosphere.... For food... looks better on menu then reality."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland looking for a good brewpub and this one hit the spot.  Several good IPA's to choose from and wit beer for my wife.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and soft spoken.  We both had the Perogies which filled our plates and stomachs.  I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ohio City's newest, and perhaps largest hot spot may soon become it's best hot spot. The Market Garden and Brewery is an impressive space located on W.25th in the heart of Ohio City next to the West Side Market. Complete with a street side patio, two large bars with multiple HDTV's, plenty of dining seating and a large rear patio perfect for relaxing with friends or for meeting new ones this place has a little something for everyone.    The menu is fresh, albeit a little small. The burgers and the BLT are both delicious. The beer selection is large and includes micro brews from around the country along with their own house brews. To top it off they are open 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Guaranteed to be the new near west side after holiday hot spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to MGB multiple times all of them were pleasant experiences. My most recent trip had me vs a beet salad. The lemon yogurt vinaigrette alone made the dish. Some of the beets were fried and crispy like bacon - a fellow diner who hates beets even enjoyed a sample. Beers were good although I forget which I ordered."}
{"text":"I LOVE Market Garden! They have great beers, the food is awesome and so is the service...doesn't get much better than that! My favorite time to go is for Brunch on Sundays.  They are always rotating around the brunch menu and I think at one point or another I've probably tried most of the brunch items.  However, it's hard for me not to get the Chicken and Waffles because it's so delicious! (and the perfect hangover cure...with a mason jar of coke) I've also had great burgers and tacos for dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. Has a private room for parties.  Craft beer selections from house and local brewers. Flight was presented beautifully.  Decided to go while in Cleveland on business.  Poutine was just ok. (The reason we chose this place along with the beer) Made \"lighter\" with chicken gravy...hmmm, ok. It was good, but not awesome.  Got roasted eggplant sandwhich and fries. Prefer to order vegetarian dishes when possible since I cook at home, but rarely vegetarian. My husband is definately a carnivore. Eggplant was tough and bread was overly oily, but obviously started as great crusty bread. Had to deconstruct to eat. Fries, were seasoned well, but a very small portion. Same fries used in the poutine, which kind of disappointed me.Left me wanting more food for the price.  The main dining room was almost all hightop tables with tall stools. For a short person these are not comfortable. The tables that were not hightops had \"Reserved\" signs on them, but were not seated while we were there. They could have been seated and turned. For some reason there was not salt and pepper on the tables. I have worked with chefs before that saw S&P on the tables as insulting, but come on...you serve burgers, get off it. Whether it was a front of the house oversite or not, it took an act of congress to get salt, which the poutine was in dire need of. The server was sweet, but forgot our requests.  It is fall in Cleveland, so why was the front door propped open? Was not only cold on my back and legs but cooled our food quickly. The husband was on the other side of the table, so I didnt mention it to him. He was happy to get his beer.   It was quite a walk  through people pan handling.I'm no judge, and have fallen on hard times myself, but I must admit, it was off- putting. Not the fault of the establishment, just a heads up for safety. A few people were very rude when i ran out of pocket cash.  The beer saved our experience but would not recommend for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Sunday brunch and tried the chicken and waffles which were pretty good. My friend Ted ordered the wedge salad and was equally pleased. We each had a John Daly to wet our whistles which could have been a little stiffer, but were definitely drinkable. The best part of the experience was their back patio. With a nice big fire place this spot is going to be a great hit this fall as the weather starts to get a little cooler."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and our tacos, pretzels and beer were all great. Service was good too.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly sliders, PBLT sandwich, beer cheese soup, beet salad, wings, and burger. They were incredibly busy today, to the point that the hostesses were helping as they could.  We sat downstairs, and were wearing our coats for the first 20 minutes. We finally realized that the loading dock door was propped open - with no one or a vehicle near it to explain why, and asked our server if she could close it.  We were one set of silverware and napkin short, asked for them twice, but they were never brought out. We finally grabbed a stack of small napkins off of the bar and shared knives and forks. The soup came first, followed by everything else all at once. Sliders had cold pork belly with almost no meat, all fat.  The wings were good, but none of the promised additional sauces ever came. A side of mayonnaise was also requested and came well after everyone was done with their entrees.  The beet salad was good. The burger was good, but again, a requested extra ketchup never came. One person at our table was offered an additional beer, once. I requested one and it never came after 20 minutes, but fortunately wasn't on our check so we didn't have to argue that point.  All in all, I'd come back, but only if they were not nearly as busy or if they have more adequate staffing."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they try to suck at service. It took 10 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge anyone. He was rolling silverware just ignoring the line of people. Finally got a seat and didn't see the waitress for ten minutes. She had zero customer service skills. Took another ten minutes to get my beer. Never saw her again to check on us. Only reason I gave it two stars is because the patio is great and the music was good. They should all find another job though. Not in customer service."}
{"text":"Visiting the Market Garden Brewery for the first time left me feeling like I just bought a new car with all these features I didn't know I needed, but now I can't do without em. Cleveland needed a real beer garden like we all need a sun roof. Cleveland needed a brewery that makes beers for hot summer afternoons like we all need air conditioned leather seats. Cleveland needed more classy restaurants like we all need that Porche. While I don't actually own a car, nor do I particularly want one, I already want to go back to Market Brewery. I suspect and hope that this is more than a restaurant; this is the beginning of a new Cleveland Institution.   Can we call West 25th and Carnegie/Lorain the Brewery District yet?"}
{"text":"The perfect place to go out with a big group of friends. We reserved a table on the patio and had lots of people coming and going throughout the night. Kendra, our server, was totally awesome, so friendly and attentive, and kept the drinks and food coming all night. Everyone had a great time. Not to mention the excellent beer list and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place.  I've been here with so many different groups of people (despite my 1 check in!) and have had an excellent experience each time.  This review is going to be short, simple, and sweet:  The beer & drink menus rock.  A lot of different options to suit everyone's wants, needs, desires.  Food also rocks: try the tacos, the soft pretzel (a personal fave), and the pierogies (also a personal fave).    The location, decor, and vibe are awesome and it's large so you don't feel claustrophobic.  Great for groups.  Also home to one of my favorite patios.  If you haven't been here yet, then you absolutely should check it out.  Swing by after an Indian's game or grab lunch after a trip to the West Side Market.  Perfect place to plop down, relax, and have a drink."}
{"text":"Fantastic Flights! (options for everyone) My husband and I brought 2 other couples to TGMB a few weekends ago and it was perfect! Got a seat outside right away (for 6!), gorgeous day and great service. We went just for a few beers because we had lunch plans already for later.  Great way to relax after a long visit to the West Side Market (next door) The beer flights are super cute (and by that I mean manly and bad ass) and were pretty big in size. We did not eat here but definitely will next visit to Cleveland. Can't wait to return and stay longer."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not rate as zero is because you can't. My husband and I visited on Sunday, November 13 around 4 pm. We sat at a 6 top table where another couple was already seated. We had not been to the establishment before so we asked them if the wait staff came to the table or if we needed to order from the bar. They confirmed the wait staff came to the table. After waiting several minutes my husband went to the bar to order our drinks. The two servers standing there told him the bartender was not there but offered no further assistance.  They watched him as he returned to our table but still no assistance. Needless to say, we left.  We went next door to the West Side Market and had great sandwiches and napoleons. Thank you Market Garden Brewery for your inattention."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday celebration with some friends. We ordered food and drinks. I ordered a cheese plate as an appetizer and couldn't eat it because it was that bad. Our server was rude and didn't care. We all ordered shots and I had a fly in mine. We asked for separate checks and she gave us attitude about it."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Fried chicken was fabulous. Beet salad was super fresh and light. Great patio with wood burning fire place. Definitely looking forward to going back during the warmer months."}
{"text":"This place was very mediocre. The prices would be fine if the food was at all good. I had to ask for tartar sauce (which turned out to be a pretty good remoulade- I should've asked if it was house made) and salt to eat the incredibly bland fried cod. The breaded chicken sandwich was bland as well. Memorable only for the stark difference between price and quality.   The service was good."}
{"text":"I hope to be able to update this review someday with a better rating, because I do see great potential in Market Garden.  The space is beautiful and the beer garden is probably one of the most comfortable and attractive outdoor dining spots in town.  Some of the food is pretty good, and the in-house beers are okay.  HOWEVER.  The service is inconsistent at best.  In three visits, I have had one really good server.  On two other visits, service ranged from mediocre to bad.  No water refills, inattentiveness, mistakes on the check, unfamiliarity with the menu... that sort of thing.  You know, I've had similar experiences at Bar Cento (although not quite as bad), so I'm thinking it might be an overall training issue.  Also-- two inches of head on a draft ordered at the bar.  There is really no excuse for that at a brewery, guys.  A brewery.  And the bartender couldn't pour a beer.  (Actually, two beers, FWIW.)  You've been warned.  Kitchen issues-- table's food not all out at the same time, missing condiments.  They seem to do better when you order little things here and there, as opposed to a bunch of food all at once.  I am not a big eater, but even I find the portion sizes small.  I think the quality of the food has improved over the last few months, but I still leave feeling hungry-- the bang for the buck is not great in comparison to other Cleveland restaurants.    This place is busy whenever I'm there, so I think that MGB will be around for a long time and will hopefully improve.  Not gonna lie, I'll be back when they get the distillery up and running.  Maybe I just need a stiffer drink in order to get past my pickiness."}
{"text":"I love the layout of this place. The space is perfect! The patio is amazing, and the food and booze are killer (try a scotch egg). Nice work Market Garden!"}
{"text":"A trendy, stylish spot with a cuisine that would still appeal to Cleveland working-class: beer and meat. Service is very attentive and informative. The quasi-vineyard, cafeteria-style seating in the outside patio is lively and much recommended.   The eggplant sandwich was savoury in aroma, taste and texture. The beer was good, however, of the two I drank and three others I tasted, they all seemed to be too safe. None had a very bold flavour or aroma, quaffable, yet too quaffable.   On the way out be sure to tell Cleveland what you want to do before you die - TED junkies rejoice!"}
{"text":"Great beer.  Decent food.  Nice atmosphere.   Two downsides. 1.  I'm no fuddyduddy and I like some background music in a restaurant but it was way too loud at one of the booths near the bar.   2. Also, they need to redirect some of their light fixtures so they don't have bare lightbulbs shining directly in the faces of the customers. It's like being in a police lineup at certain spots."}
{"text":"The Market Garden Brewery is a great place in the afternoon and early evening as you can enjoy their food, have a good beer or two that they brewed out back and avoid the large crowds that will overtake this place past 6pm.    I have never had a complaint about their food, but when I go it is for the beer (they make a very good scotch ale) but a smore with bacon is never a bad plan."}
{"text":"Don't come here for brunch. They have no breakfast items on the menu. Lunch and dinner, ok. Beers, great place"}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet but I liked W. 25th better in 1996.  It used to be you could drive over the bridge and buy a bag of crack with your groceries on Saturday morning.  Now you have to go like 10 blocks more west.  I blame gentrification."}
{"text":"Went here excited to try something new although the beer selection is wonderful the food is subpar. I had the ribeye which in itself was okay, not very flavorful but paired with all the mushy stuff on the plate it was awful and the flavors did not mesh. The eggs came out whole and we cut them in half and they didn't have any taste they were dry and just not good, I would not recommend them. The Pretzel was wonderful the best thing I ate. The beer cheese soup was tasty. My daughter had chicken and waffles and whatever the sauce was underneath it was disgusting.. to spend that kind of money it was very disappointing, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to Market Garden Brewery three times but only eaten there once. I had dinner on opening night, and this was a 4 or 5 star experience. I was with my girlfriend. We ordered a meat board appetizer and mussels. Both were exceptional. The meats were very tasty. In fact, the inclusion of bits of sausage with the mussels enticed us to try the meat board. For dinner, we tried two of the tacos, and both were delicious. Service was amazing this night. They wisely overstaffed, and we didn't wait for anything.  I'm a beer snob, so take my comments accordingly. I felt that the selection should have been pared down and more care put into the product. Several of the beers were good, but given the hype I was expecting more. Great Lakes has Dortmunder Gold as a terrific, go-to beer, plus a small selection of well crafted brews. I haven't found a go-to beer at Market Garden yet, and none of the specialty brews were memorable. I've tried them all.  Another time I went was on July 4, and I just had a beer or two on the sidewalk patio. It was quiet at that time, and I enjoyed my beer.   I tried to eat there yet another time, but the wait for a table was obnoxious, so we went elsewhere.  The next time was on a absurdly busy Friday or Saturday night. This place is attracting a club crowd, as another review pointed out. It's trendy right now and I expect it will die down. However, that's no excuse for the crapola non-service I experienced. First, we were in the beer garden and were able to find a spot at a table. All the tables were a mess, as if we were at a frat party or something. Really, they were disgusting. A waitress coming by with drinks told us we couldn't get table service--I never did understand why. So, I went inside to the nearby bar. After 15-20 minutes of being ignored at the bar (I'm not exaggerating on the time) I got fed up and left. I'm too old to be jumping up and down like a hyena in heat to get a bartender's attention. We went to ABC for a non-trendy beer. It was also busy, but we waited all of 60 seconds to get served.  I really want this place to succeed. But until crowds die down and/or service is improved, I'm staying away."}
{"text":"There were eight adults and a two year old for a birthday dinner. Service was horrible. If there had not been a 20% gratuity included, my server would not have gotten that much of a tip. The waiter did not clear the table so there was a bunch of appetizer plates still on table while we were eating dinner. My boyfriend had the fried chicken which was overcooked. The waiter only asked one time during the two hour dinner if people wanted drinks. For the amount of money we paid for dinner and the lousy service and only okay food, I will not return."}
{"text":"Why I keep coming back to Market Garden:  Sunday brunch with good options (My favorites are the omelet with sausage and burger with egg) that goes til 3, and bottomless mimosas for 15 dollars.  Their beers are also good, though they just got rid of my favorite so I had to switch to Friar Power, which I like, but not quite as much.  During the week, it is hit or miss.  Lots of annoying people on the weekends sometimes, so I try to stick to Sundays.  Service is usually very good, though better at the tables than the bars. I have heard bartenders complaining about customers and arguing with each other on different occasions.  They also seem to have no sense of urgency.  The servers work faster.  So come on Sundays and sit at a table!"}
{"text":"2 bartenders that worked New Years Eve were the biggest a-holes of all time. Treated the barbacks like absolute garbage. They would intentionally break glasses on the floor and make the barebacks clean it up and talk crap to them. Hope these 2 get fired. Absolutely dispicable. Would love to raise hell with ownership about this."}
{"text":"My company had their Xmas party in the basement and I have to say it was not a good choice of venues for such an event as the noise level was very loud & the table seating was not at all convenient for a large group to socialize through. We had 3 large long tables and only ONE server? First screw up! The food runners had no idea where to put the food or who ordered what. The scotch-eggs were a delight and yummy, the cheese/meat bored was nothing to be pleased over, and the wings were a tad slimy. (I prefer mine to be well done and crispy, each to their own) I had the 14 oz. rib-eye, blue cheese mash potatoes, and kale. The rib-eye was decently flavored however I ordered it med-well and came to me med-rare, second mistake! The fig steak sauce was a great bonus to the rib-eye and very flavorful. The mashed potatoes were horrible and they probably put less that a tsp. on my plate and the kale was HORRIBLE & SALTY!  Now on to the desert..GROSS,STALE, & BLAND! I suggest next time they walk over to the market and order some cheesecake or something because this was a joke. Stick with the brewing of beer and stop serving food! Favorite thing about The Garden Market is that they serve VanderMill beers! To say the least I will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty beers We had a great time watching a the Cavs win! We celebrated my husband's Birthday 2 years in a row."}
{"text":"the food took awhile but the shrimp tacos were really good. our sever Eva didn't want to explain menu items and kind of rushed us out. service needs work."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch and we were pleasantly surprised with our experience. Great local beer selection. Our server was very knowledgeable about each one and guided us accordingly to our tastes. There's not much to get excited about a grilled chicken sandwich, but I must say, it was the best chicken sandwich I've eaten in a really long time. Not over-cooked and comes with just the right amount of fresh toppings. The street tacos were also really good, though a bit too spicy. The atmosphere is charming - modern yet still warm and inviting. The only complaint is the sound-system inside is really over-powering. Overall, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Beer flights are awesome. The chicken tacos, pierogies and salmon dinners are good and well priced. Service was exceptional. Table outside front is nice. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We were there on a Monday night. there were many problems with the food and service and the bill has a mandatory 20 percent charge.I would not mind except the 12 dollar hamburger was not nearly as good as mcdonalds and tasted like bubba burgers from Marcs.We ordered 4 appetizers .All were terrible. The food was delivered to the wrong people and then given to us minutes later.I don't mind paying 6dollars for a brewery beer but this food was barely edible even for bar food and very pricey for garbage.I had to ask the server to remove our appetizer plates as there was no room on the table.Our group was 7 people and the bill for three was 140 dollars with 2 drinks total.Based on my experience I would venture to say that their kitchen is probably not meeting city sanitary codes either. I can eat better at mcdonals for quite a bit less. This place was a rip-off. The market garden brewery should just be a bar without any food and serve peanuts at the bar. Food was a zero service a 1 and price was outrageous. Will never go back. A place like this does not deserve repeat business and will probably will close if things dont change. I think the people who write glowing reviews for them are either friends or paid to do so. Mike F."}
{"text":"Menu looked like it was going to do a number on my bowels; so I asked about something less \"Bomb-ish\". I was point to the tacos....Hmmmm, I am always leery of food oddities like tacos in a brewery or cheeseburgers in a Mexican joint. But I tried them anyway and I am glad I did! they were just what I wanted, not too heavy and greasy but well paired with my Ale. Next time I drive through this nice city, I will come again."}
{"text":"Their wings and cheese fries on the appetizer menu are pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The good: The food was outstanding! The beer cheese soup is silky and delectable. I highly recommend the ribeye as well! A 14oz cut of fork tender deliciousness layered over a potato hash and topped with onion and char broiled asparagus, dill and parsley with a wonderful demiglaze. We were seated quickly (on a Saturday night, no less) and service was fast. The bad: while fast, service was not friendly. He used as few words as possible and never offered smile even. Our server also didn't offer boxes and although my husband had half of his entree left, and the server unceremoniously took his plate (He was finished, but would have accepted a box of asked) I had to ask for a box before he left with my plate too and he brought boxes ridiculously large for the portion leaving the building with me. Think a quart container for a cup of soup.... kind of weird.  Overall, a decent visit. I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"The nitro stout was fantastic, so was the food. Fish tacos were great, another member of our party had a veggie burger (had a bite and this was the only veggie burger i have ever liked in my life!)."}
{"text":"Great outdoor spot right next to West Side Market. Tasty shrimp tacos, but SLOW service!  Took forever to be seated, forever for our order to be taken, and the food was eaten before the first beer arrived!  Good thing we were enjoying the nice weather while we waited!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, but have never been too impressed. This last experience will likely be my past.   Granted, we did have a group of 10 show up with out any advance warning. I know its annoying for servers to split checks, but most of our group had worked in the industry before so we told the server prior to ordering that we were going to do separate checks. The poor server must have been new to serving tables. Both food and drinks came out sporadically, no silverware was given and it took an hour for us to get our checks. Food was sub-par. Best thing was the one drink we were able to get. No thanks Market Garden."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch on Friday and were pleased with what we got. Their beer is very good - I had their Progressive Pilsner and it was perfect. We weren't that hungry so we just got one of the plates on the menu that you can share between two people. The dish we chose was sausages in a curried tomato sauce served over seasoned fries. The fries were great with just the right amount of seasoning and the sauce that the sausages came in was delicious and not too spicy. The service wasn't too bad although our bartender wasn't exactly Mr. Personality but he was quick and ultimately, that's what counts. The crowd seems to be on the younger side - kind of hipster/trendy. For what we were there for, it was a great choice. We didn't get to try any of their larger lunch options but I will definitely keep this place in mind for the future because reading the menu, it looked like there were some delish things on there."}
{"text":"This place has truly got an awesome atmosphere. It's got old-fashioned chandeliers, big TVs at the bar showing all the games that day, and a refreshing indie rock playlist that you may find familiar from obscure Pandora stations and the background of car commercials. There's a little something in Market Garden's atmosphere to make anyone comfortable and relaxed.  The service unfortunately left some to be desired. Despite being a Friday afternoon, the kitchen had run out of cheese, taking some hot items off the menu. The menu also advertises having gluten-free items available, and while some - like beers and ales - were on hand, the kitchen was also short of gluten-free bread, so a member of our party unfortunately had to change his order late in our stay. Whether that change in order may have caused this, I can't say, but the food was very slow in arrival, taking over an hour on a seemingly average shift. However, the Ohio Beef burger and seasoned fries I ordered were prepared well (plus, the slices of bacon I got on the burger were THICK!).  All in all, this restaurant has its ups and downs. The atmosphere is to die for and is absolutely phenomenal for nights out for twenty- and thirty-somethings. But be prepared to take some time here and potentially have to be adventurous with your meal choices."}
{"text":"Loved Market Garden in the past, and it is a go to when other spots on W 25th are packed. But sad to say that this spot has been inconsistent of late.  Sometimes great and other times not good.  Also seems like food comes to table, not as the menu describes. Great atmosphere and great bar  but wishing for more from this spot lately."}
{"text":"The menu is uninspired, I always find myself reading it over and over again in hopes something would jump out at me. I usually settle for the tacos. Once I asked for their popcorn as an appetizer and it was stale.   Only reason I've been there more than once is because my friend keeps having her birthday there.   Atmosphere feels like a frat house/sorority party."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were immediately greeted by a host and taken to a table with no wait at all. Our service was sub par to say the least. We never got our servers name, and honestly she probably spoke five sentences to us. She got me a second round of beer without me even asking, and I wanted to switch beers so I was disappointed. Although the  beers were great. We had the poutine and wings which were very good, I got the fish tacos for dinner and my boyfriend got the shrimp tacos. They were good but nothing to rave about. Overall fine experience, but I would have enjoyed it much more had the service been actual service."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 hangout places in Cleveland!  Cool atmosphere & good beer.  Food is usually great too.  Was here for brunch once and my food was terrible, but that was my only sub par dining experience.  Layout is great... Patio outside if the weather is nice... downstairs for private/closed events... 2 bars in the main room to travel between.  Waitresses are usually very stylish and cute (that probably sounds a little sexist... but whatever... they definitely help the \"trendy\" and \"cool\" atmosphere of this place).  Is there better food in Cleveland?  Yes.  Are there cooler places to hang with friends and grab some drinks?  Maybe... but not many."}
{"text":"Disappointed-go to Bier Market or Town Hall. I've been here before and had a decent time but last night was sub-par. The bar was slow at 6pm but we had very slow service. The spicy black bean tacos were pretty good but you have to pay extra for not only guacamole (it really should be free on a vegetarian taco!) but much to my chagrin when the bill came, hot sauce too! The waitress asked if I wanted hot sauce but neglected to say she would charge me for it. If you added it to the price of the tacos you would seem less cheap. Lots of places have good food; I want to support businesses with excellent service and this isn't that place."}
{"text":"A group of 12 young ladies came to Market Garden on Sat night (6/1/13) for a Bachelorette party around 10:30PM and were asked to leave because we were distracting their customers who were eating dinner. Actually the people eating were cheering us on and were glad to have some excitement in the bar! It's a shame that the Management handled it the way they did, especially since the BRIDE 2 BE had her ENGAGEMENT Party there. Not sure why you would want to lose out on service. We are a group of classy girls and felt that the way we were treated was disrespectful. Guess we will take our business elsewhere!!!!!! So if you are looking to go out with a group of people, don't go to Market Garden!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for work and discovered their Prosperity wheat at another local spot.  I made the trek over from my hotel with high hopes for a few beers and maybe a bite to eat.  The Chinook Strike IPA was a solid start.    Once my glass was dry, the bar tender spent the rest of my time down at the other end making fun of another customer with a regular and lamenting about Lebron maybe heading out west once NBA free agency hits.  Paid my tab, went to Great Lakes and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there instead."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the beer...21 house beers on tap with flights available!  Each beer I had was good for it's variety. Food looked great, but I only had beer tasters. The crowd was fun on a Thursday evening, music was the appropriate volume, it was a nice nice out. I'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"The very first time my boyfriend and I went to Market Garden we had a great time! It was on a Sunday evening and we each did beer flights and were happy with our choices. Waitress was friendly and not very crowded, I ordered the pierogies and brats and it was wonderful! My boyfriend ordered the burger with fries and he said was also really good. We left pleased.  The second time we went back was after Taste of Tremont since it's close and we were gonna have more food and drinks. Upon arriving at the restaurant their was no hostess and 3 other parties behind us waiting, we stood there for about 7 minutes until somebody acknowledged us, we then were seated on the back patio. Going to order our food we were informed pretty much half of their menu was \"out\" How do you run out of food when you know a festival is going on??? I was not happy, I decided to forgo an entree. Service was also particularly slow that evening.   I would still go back because their food is really good, just maybe on another day than a sunday!"}
{"text":"The beer here is great.  The brewmaster is a true craftsman in his trade.  The service can be hit or miss.  We've had both good and horrible service here.  Brunch is typically tasty and laid back.  Bottomless mimosas!!  YES!  The food has improved over time and is generally quite good.  But beware, this place turns into douchebag central after about 10pm!"}
{"text":"The beer is good (best brewpub I've been to in Cleveland) but the food is pretty average. So I suggest getting drunk before you order anything off the excellently designed menu. That way youll hate yourself less for spending 50 dollars on a shitty meal."}
{"text":"Despite the name, not quite an unsuccessful Dutch/German restaurant.  Visited Market Garden for Sunday brunch prior to the Browns dropping a gimme against the then-pitiful Oakland Raiders.  An amazing space next to the West Side Market (probably its namesake?), Market Garden offers two indoor bars/dining rooms as well as a heated outdoor bar and dining area.  No booze before noon, so ordered a flight of microbrew, which was overall pretty reasonable.  Food was also just reasonable, as the \"famous\" breakfast burrito was overall a pretty bland combination of egg, cheese, and underspiced sausage.  Maybe they should rethink the recipe.  As should have the Allies in September 1944!"}
{"text":"My ONLY complaint.......everyone smokes on the patio and nobody cares.  There are NO smoking signs everywhere.  Blah, there are other bars on 25th.  They'll get our business."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that the service gets 5 stars.  I had made reservations for dinner Friday for 9 people, and was told that we still might need to wait a bit for a table on the patio because they techinically only take reservations for inside.  The girl was really nice about it on the phone, saying they'd make it work.  We were probably the most annoying party possible because half the group was running 30 minutes late, and we showed up with 2 extra people.  Still they got us seated outside right away, and were very friendly and accomodating.  My friends continued to be difficult by ordering things that were not on the menu.  First, an appetizer of \"loaded nachos\" which were AMAZING and they should definitely consider adding them to the menu because they were by far the best food we got there.  Later on we needed a fruit plate, a repeat order of the nachos, and some girly shots that were \"not too sweet\".  Through all this our waitress (Ashley)  was amazingly nice and helptul.    I'd give them 5 stars, except that the rest of the food was not great.  Three or four people in our group had the veggie burger, and they all said it was dry and bland.  I shared shrimp and chicken tacos with a friend.  We both love spicy food, but agreed that the heat of the chicken tacos was overpowering.  The flavor wasn't bad, but just needed something else to balance it.  They used the same chicken on the nachos, and it was really good in that.  The shrimp tacos were better than the chicken, but still just ok.  I also had a beer sampler, which was a little expensive, but the beers were good.  I really liked the patio in the back.  It's a nice space with long shared tables and a big fireplace that really smelled nice like a backyard bonfire.  When we got there at 7:30 on a Friday evening with perfect weather, there were still plenty of open spaces on the patio even without having reservations."}
{"text":"This Cleveland biz - delicious and innovative brews, tasty burgers, gorgeous interior and the best brunch around. Living in Cleveland for a short time and my brother living there most of his life, I have been to a majority of the spots in the city and this is one of my faves. It seems like with every visit they are revolutionizing themselves with new and more menu, beer and cocktail options. I LOVE SEEING THAT!  Their brunch - the best. My boyfriend lives for their waffle sammie. THEY ALSO HAVE FLIGHTS OF MIMOSAS. Try all four of their flavors in one sitting. I of course go for the more sweet brunch option with their waffles and apple toppings.  Dinner - go for their burgers, they are different and savory. I opted for the brisket burger, 1/2 lbs. beef patty topped with braised brisket, white cheddar, BBQ aioli and local grains served on an egg bun. Zach went with a new menu item - the sweet n' spicy burger. He was dying over the \"bacon jam\" placed on their burger which we are assuming is like a bacon purée spread. He joked about getting himself a jar to take home. My parents for the Ohio beef burger, the standard burger option here, and they were also happy with their choice as well!  TIP: There shareables are not very \"sharable.\" As a family for dinner we ordered the fresh baked salted pretzel and the street corn. Both we one serving we had to cut to share, the pretzel wasn't a big deal but the corn was just on one large ear of corn. This seems only sharable on a date night and certainly not a first or second date.   Grab yourself a hella rita, mixed with their mango IPA, or one of their innovative brews and have a good time! I have yet to sit out in their market garden, which looks like it would even be in use in the colder months with the large fireplace and heaters. I'll have to sit outside next visit for sure."}
{"text":"First I had to call multiple times in order to make a reservation for my party of 13 because a manager had to approve, but never returned my calls. :-(  Luckily I'm persistent and was determined to get the reservation, mainly because my group was attending a Cleveland Beer Week event around the corner! Bottom line the food was great and the beers were not so bad either. I had the squash soup and it was amazing (unfortunately I think it may be a seasonal item.)   Everyone seemed to be very pleased with their dishes (the tacos were a big hit in particular.) The service was great and we were able to get in and out in plenty of time to make our event. We will be sure to stop by again the next time we are in town (this time with 10 or less because those reservations do not require a managers approval!)"}
{"text":"I decided to come back after a poor experience last time and it wasn't much better. I was allowed to order food this time which was an improvement from last time when we couldn't place a food order because the kitchen was so far behind. Today we got food but it was still soooo slow. Additionally, they aren't willing to make any exceptions or accommodate any customers requests. I wanted one pancake with my brunch. Nope, won't do it. Refuses. Come on! It's one pancake."}
{"text":"I went here after a trip to the West Side Market. Up until then, I had only had a few drinks at the Market Garden Brewery, so I was ready to taste the food. It was so good -- I only wish that I had not eaten as much at the West Side Market so I wouldn't have been so full. The service was great. I was really impressed because our waiter was working as a bartender as well, and it was crowded. But we did not have to wait for anything. I only wish it hadn't been raining so that we could have sat on the patio."}
{"text":"I agree with Carl A about the atmosphere trumping the food/drinks. I was way surprised at how spacious this place was. I was expecting something very crowded and narrow, but was pleasantly surprised.  The food: it was hard to make a decision, not because everything looked great, but because it was kind of slim pickings for me. And oh my, the prices. (Not to sound like an old lame-o.) $7 for ONE pretzel? And $9 for a salad that's not an entree salad? The smoked pork tacos were excellent tasting, but I think others might complain about their size (smallish) and lack of ingredients. But they hit the spot for me.  The beer: we got 2 samplers for our table of 4, and I sipped/sampled a couple. I wasn't too impressed. The beer tasted kind of watered down and just \"whatever.\" Nothing really remarkable can be said. My dining companions agreed. Since they have a nice selection of other beers, I may go that route if I come back to MGB.  Would love to try the garden sometime, but for now it's just too flippin' hot."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 7 and we were seated promptly in the bar area. Started off with the salted pretzel with beer cheese and house made mustard. Pretzel was large and plenty for four people. I really enjoyed the beer cheese and I didn't try the mustard (just not a mustard girl). We also got the chorizo stuffed pierogis drenched in beer cheese and white sauce. I didn't love these. It was a little too much sauce for me and tasted almost fried.   I had the turkey sandwich. Hmm, it was just okay for me. First, I thought the bread was a little burnt and none of the flavors were strong. It had lots of turkey but just lacked something. The fries were good.  I wish I would have gone with my heart and order the truffle Mac and cheese. Maybe next time...  Waitress was friendly and attentive. They have an awesome draft beer list and cool outdoor patio. Their is also a back room with seating and a bar that looked like it was the place to be!"}
{"text":"THEY MAKE THEIR OWN BEER! It's delicious and with a great price. Really retro, really nice. A \"must return\"."}
{"text":"I went there with my mom just to try something new. the menu was small but we had the duck sliders for an app and they were pretty good. for our entrees, i had the mac and cheese and she had mustard and buttermilk chicken. the mac and cheese was delicious! My mom didnt like the chicken like that but it was because it had a sweet taste to it. the waitress was on her job. she checked on his regularly and was very knowledgeable about the beer selection. would i go back? definitely! just wish they had more food to chose from"}
{"text":"Food was great for a brewery.  Beer was excellent also.  Everyone enjoyed their food.   Appetizers and dinner were great.    Unique menu."}
{"text":"Last minute dinner reservations for ten landed us at this fine establishment for a birthday get together on Saturday. Only place in the city that would accommodate us, so that was great. This wasn't our first choice because we don't drink craft beers. So we just ate, didn't drink until we left.   We tried the pretzel with the cheese soup (which was a little too salty) but it was great for a hungry group waiting for their entrees. The soup is definitely too rich to eat alone, but great for dipping that warm, soft, pretzel in. The fries appetizer smothered in gravy, black beans and mozzarella curd was divine. Something I would order again for sure.   The shrimp taco's were quite special. I highly recommend if you are a fish or shrimp taco connoisseur. Something I always order if it's on the menu, regardless of where I am. This one gave me the gourmet feel with the pickled carrots, jalapeno and onion garnish (extra, next time for me). Also had a nice salsa on it. Not a bad quality shrimp either. For the price of the food ($11 shrimp taco's, $9 appetizers) I would definitely come here again for the scenery and the yummy eats.   My girlfriends didn't think the salad with chicken was anything special, nor was the chicken sandwich worth writing home about. But I heard the blue cheese burger (add egg) was actually super yummy, served with fried too. The fried chicken entree however, looked really good and I still didn't get to try their pierogies yet...."}
{"text":"Went earlier yesterday before work and got the 12 oz. ribeye. Was not very happy with the results. Steak felt a little under cooked. The  outside of the steak didn't have those dark sear marks and there was a lot of fat on the steak too. They also put a scoop of bleu cheese on top (it came that way from the menu). It looked like blue butter. Thought it was unique and thought it would taste good but didn't. The presentation was excellent. Top notch. The guy behind the bar was nice. Had a conversation and he asked about my food. My score would be higher but was there a couple of weeks ago and got the shrimp tacos and thought that they were really good just not something I would get again."}
{"text":"I've officially upgraded my review after a lot of debate.   I'm still slightly disappointed in their beers, though they have grown on me. The food, on the other hand, though it hasn't changed, along with my order, has stayed consistent and delicious. Those shrimp tacos get me every time! The shrimp is plentiful and with a little bit of lime, these things are some of the best I've ever had!   The atmosphere is a little hit or miss; sometimes it's packed with a really cool and calm crowd and other times it seems a little more like a sports bar, which bugs me a bit, but we keep to the bar and ourselves. I can definitely say I like this place now! (But, if I just want a beer and/or burger, I'm going to have to say there are better options.)"}
{"text":"Our last stop of the night was Market Garden Brewery. Reading that at night it gets packed and we wanted to have dinner we made reservations. We were sat immediately and wow is this place big. It was insane in there, seemed like all of Cleveland flocked inside. Next door is a big grocery market place which was closed at this point, but all I heard was good things about it. -From what I read online, we went with just the cheese board. It was tasty and I would recommend it if you want to just eat something light. -The service wasn't very good, the girl seemed to be pulled in 20 different directions but after 2 breweries and a bar we were relaxed and it was fine. -As for the beer I got the sample in which you write down which 6 you want. I went with the Citramax IPA (very hoppy, I liked it a lot), Cluster IPA (it was just okay), Kennet Ale (not bad, very flavorful), Viking Pale Ale (decent), St Emetics Stout (okay) and the Beer Garden Block (okay). -The beer was okay, the place was packed, and service wasn't great..but again with three breweries in one block I highly recommend checking this place out. While it didn't blow me away, I am very glad I went."}
{"text":"Having a Bernie Beer (5.5% ABV, $6) and some swanky pierogies ($16) just before Science Cafe chat at the Market Garden Brewery."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for a Cavs playoff game watch party.  Excellent meal and good drinks served throughout.  I tried both the beef brisket burger as well as an order of poutine.  Burger was cooked to perfection, topped with braised brisket, white cheddar cheese, a fried pickled onion and bbq aioli.  Juicy and to die for!  Instead of fries, we swapped a side salad that my wife really enjoyed.  We also shared an order of their poutine...seasoned fries topped with cheese curds, smoked chicken gravy and fresh herbs.  Yummers, for sure.  Their beer selection was quite nice as well...I'm a dark beer kinda guy and really enjoyed their  St. Emeric's Stout on Nitro.  I'm sure we'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place is good for a night out with friends or catching up with family! The beer is awesome and the burgers are pretty good. Our food came out quickly and was hot and fresh. We ordered the pretzel to start and it did not disappoint. We celebrated my beer-loving-boyfriend's birthday here and loved it. Four stars only because it was a bit expensive and were not running to go here over other places, but wouldn't mind returning."}
{"text":"I liked the place.  Derreck our waiter was cool. My note say I would go back, with out a fuss, if others wanted to.  (I visited last Aug, 2013, just cleaning up my draft reviews, I reckon I had hoped to ad photos)."}
{"text":"Got right in for an early brunch at 10:30 AM on a Sunday!   Our server was quiet but very nice. We were all still wrecked from the night before so no booze but the mimosa flights looked fabulous!  I ordered the waffle sandwich and it was a perfect hearty breakfast!!  Waffles, turkey, bacon, perfectly cooked subside up egg on top.  The crispy potatoes were on point!  My husband got the omelet and it looked great.  For two dishes and a coffee it was only $25 which was a great value considering I could only eat half of my meal!  Best part was 90s slow jams all morning!!!!!!! Took us way back and we had so much fun singing along to old school jams."}
{"text":"Started with a flight of beers from the brewery. All were delicious!  The pork tacos were filling and well prepared. Will visit again when I return to the Land."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and you have to check out their store. Want to sign up for a tour!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both had a burger for our entree. We each got a different one so we could try them. They were literally the best burgers we have ever had. And the scotch eggs are really good as well."}
{"text":"The only reason it received three stars was for the beer. The food was over priced for the the quality. My cousin ordered the beer cheese soup, it was the same sludge that they poured over my chorizo pierogies. This was a definite disappointment!"}
{"text":"The manager JIM is a complete jerk. When complaining about a plate of food, I was greeted with sneers and rolled eyes. I enjoyed some of the food but after receiving 3 items that had been pulled from a bag and deep fried, I was highly upset when they costed 9 dollars. Waiter was fantastic but sadly after JIM, you have lost a customer"}
{"text":"I know it was Mother's day, but I was not thrilled with the service from start to finish.  The hostess was aloof and not very helpful.  We had a reservation and were given an assigned table even after we asked to move and saw the people in front of us get moved outside once asking.  The bartender was our server, he spilled bloody mary on my dad's pants with no apology, and after ordering disappeared for 45 mins. until we asked for him to see where our food was.  He comped our drinks but really just seemed uninterested in helping us or proactive in telling us why we have not gotten our food an hour after we ordered.  The food was great as usual, but overall was not thrilled with the experience.  I guess the staff there is not the best choice if you are looking for entertaining your parents on what we would consider to be a special day."}
{"text":"I checked out Market Garden Brewery the first week it opened with another Yelper. Man was it packed! When I hear \"beer garden,\" I immediately think Bavaria and I get excited. The great thing about a good ol' fashioned German Beer Garden is a sense of community and Bavarian food, like potato salad, pretzels, and roasted chicken. Ironically, I was completely wrong when it came to Market Garden's menu, and I realize that's my fault. I'm the one thinking \"Bavarian.\" Yet, I was looking forward to that sort of place because there's nothing like that in the Cleve. The real food menu turned out to be surprising in its lack of originality. It seemed like a typical upscale pub grub type of place for Cleveland, including fancy tacos and burgers. The only really unique thing I recall from the menu was a pickled veggie plate. I did not order that, but I found the cheese plate to be about 1/3 to 1/2 pickled veggies.   I can't comment on the actual beer garden out back because I didn't sit there. Instead, my friend and I sat inside, but near the giant sliding glass doors that lead to the patio seating. The dining area is a fresh and clean, accented with smooth surfaces that appear to be slightly industrial and worn, with excellent views of the Ohio City street-scape. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the beer as I am unable to drink beer. That's really a pity because of all the new brews it has created. As the restaurant just opened, and opened to crowds, it ran out of about half the selection of wine by the Wednesday I stopped by. I can't remember what I ordered, but it was ok, and clearly forgettable. That's ok by me...I don't have a refined palate and I usually can only remember disgusting wine. I liked the cheeses, and the pickled veggies, but the first bite I took I yelped \"good golly, that's salty.\" In fact, when people asked me what I thought of the new spot, the first thing out of my head was \"salty.\" I heard from someone else that she thought the same thing, and her opinion wasn't based on the pickled veggies.   I realize that what I've described so far sounds \"just ok\" and not worthy of 4 stars. But, I like \"going out\" just as much for the ambiance as the food. I dug the energy and openness of the place, spring boarding my overall rating a bit higher. However, I'm still craving some tater salad and roast chicken."}
{"text":"Went there just for the beer.  A short walk from the West 25th street light rail station. The flight portions were generous: 4 and 1/2 oz per glass. I liked Old Zahm Oktoberfest and Gestalt Alt. I wish I was hungry enough to eat here. It seemed like a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Went to The Market Beer Garden for brunch today. It was my first visit. The restaurant is located in a cool area. The space is clean, friendly and nicely decorated. The beer selection is impressive.   Disappointingly, the food was a total let down. The menu sounded scrumptious but unfortunately everything we ordered was sort of bland and tasteless.   We had the deviled eggs and breakfast poutine. Others at the table had breakfast burritos, egg fritatas, and pancakes.  The food presentation was great but it was so bland that we hardly touched it (and we were hungry!) I politely took a box home but after a few tastes to reaffirm my initial thought and after adding salt and pepper (which they don't have available at the restaurant) it was still pretty inedible and went in the trash.  Bottom line, come her for drinks, not for food. Neat venue in a good location."}
{"text":"Before I go all Debbie Downer on MGB, let me say how AWESOME the space, vibe and purpose of this place is.  It's true, you will be hard pressed to find a better looking place in NEO.  And if you haven't experienced the log cabin-esque basement, you need to.  Oh, and the Ohio BEER shirts?  Instant classic!  However, I don't go to a place routinely for its architecture.  Sure, it helps, but if the food is \"meh\" at best, I won't go there for dinner.  Fine, the after-dinner drinks option is still open.   But I lose interest in that fast as the beer really doesn't vary from pale ale to wheat beer (however, their Scotch Ale is tasty!).   I'm left with only one option for you, MGB:  after-drinks-drinking.  I've tried to make you my #1 with dinner.  After you ripped my heart out, I still came back, asking you to fill my #2 role for a good drink after food.  I'm sorry to do this to you, but after multiple strikes, we're now on day-by-day terms."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken sandwich for a change...eh, not a fan. Chicken was rubbery and there was WAY too much mayo on it.  Bummer ."}
{"text":"Burger was boring, bland and dry... Fun sitting outside though.   The fries were tasty."}
{"text":"This is a great spot on W. 25th. Whether brunch, lunch, dinner, or night-cap, MGB will not disappoint. They have 2 very large bars, tons of TVs and a cool patio. The patio doesn't have much of a view, the backside of the Westside Market, but has TVs, large tables with heaters extending the season of use, and a large fireplace making a great place for fall evening beers. The food menus are pretty all encompassing, covering a wide array of options, where I have never seen anyone disappointed with their meal. I usually go for one of their kinds of tacos, which are outstanding, but the only strike against is that they don't come with any side dishes. I've had a handful of brunch items as well, and have been extremely pleased with each meal. The service here is usually pretty good. I cannot remember getting poor service, or much difficulty getting a drink from the bar, even when it's busy. Another huge positive here is that they have the OpenTable app, which allows you to make reservations. The big thing here is the beer. I've tried many different brews here, and always enjoy. They make some beers to cover all tastes, for IPA, stout, or various microbrew varieties, while also making some good Pilsner, Wheat, and straightforward lagers to satisfy people not interested in craft beers. My personal favorite is Old Zahm, their Oktoberfest Lager, which I always look forward to it's yearly release. This is another great place on W. 25th that is always in the discussion of where we want to go grab a bite or a beer."}
{"text":"Really surprised this place has such high reviews.  Food was expensive, tasteless, and wholly unimpressive.  Wait staff was dismissive,  boring, and unhelpful.  Could do without this place"}
{"text":"I went in here for lunch and a beer. We were seated on the back patio which is wide, open and is awesome on a sunny day. I ordered a chicken sandwich and an IPA (cluster). The beer wasn't all that tasty but I've been around long enough to know beer is a matter of taste and someone else may find it delicious. The Chicken sandwich was seasoned well, cooked all the way through and a large enough piece to be spilling out over the bread. The fries that came along with the sandwich were decent enough for fries but nothing to write home about. The one thing that kinda lacked here was service. The waiter was friendly enough but just a little slow on the uptake. Didn't bring us waters or even ask if we wanted some. Then he seemed to be spread too thin to take care of everyone. It could have been a problem with the back of the house or they were short staffed idk. I'd love to give this place another shot if I'm in the area again. The food would be enough to bring me back but I don't know if I'd ever fall in love with the place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an intimate, inexpensive brewery tour, this is the best choice! Small groups, cheap cost ($6/person), and a chance to try beer fresh from the tap. Call ahead if you have a large group!"}
{"text":"Market Garden Brewery is alright with me. Filled with a lot of what looked like 30-somethings and their dates and a smattering of bro dudes.  It's a very large space and kudos to MGB for creating an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy a birthday party with a group of friends or an intimate dinner with your love. You will also find 2 bars to enjoy one of your new favorite brews - we tried out Hop Soup and the Old School American Lager - both were refreshing. Next time, definitely planning on getting the beer sampler, it comes on a paddle (6 samples, $15 bucks). I also sipped on a glass of the Pinot Noir with dinner.  Even though it was cold outside the large outdoor patio (beer garden) was still open for those who wanted to enjoy the pretty night sky. On my next trip - hopefully during the day, I will definitely partake in some patio awesomeness. For this particular trip, the four of us were seated at a hightop table by the bar, at first I thought it would be uncomfortable for an entire dinner - but the seats weren't bad at all.  When it came down to ordering some grub, we ended up with housemade tortilla chips and salsa rojo, as well as the pretzel with mustard & garlic cheese for an appetizer. The chips were okay and the salsa was good - but there wasn't a whole lot of it. The pretzel on the other hand was delish and I'm in love with anything garlic - so that was a total win.  For dinner we noshed on the Fried Chicken Sandwich (chicken, braised collard greens, bacon, sawmill gravy, and tomato) and the Battered Rock Shrimp Tacos (battered shrimp, cilantro, onion, roasted poblanos, and cabbage slaw). The shrimp tacos were delish (I'd give them an A) - the right amount of cilantro - and I loooove cilantro! The chicken sandwich rated about a C. The chicken/gravy/bacon taste wasn't bad but the amount of collard greens atop the sandwich was overpowering (one of our dining partners noted that it looked like an entire briar patch had emptied onto my boyfriend's plate), the fries were lukewarm at best - just not the quality I was expecting.  While the food needs some work, I still can't wait to come back and try some of the other brews.   PS - Make reservations (on OpenTable) if you don't want to wait too long. We had made ours at 6:45p and while it wasn't packed then, it definitely filled up fast.  PSS - I have to mention that I love that our bill included a charge for a \"Soda Popinksi\" (we had a diet Coke) and I just thought that was super cutesy!"}
{"text":"Well, it fits tightly inside the typical hipster box of Ohio City. We opted out of GLB because it was about to rain. I'd have taken the rain over this place. The guy that greeted us and served us didn't seem to have much of a clue and was entirely too flustered by the 10 people sitting at the bar. \"2 adults and 2 children?\"  Nah, we just found these kids on the street and decided to drag them through west side market to play \"family\" for a day. \"I don't know if we have kids menus today...\".  Is Monday's special \"No Kids Day\"?  I digress and move on to the \"food\"; descriptive on paper, flavorless with odd textures and colors on a plate. Chicharrones?  You mean burned chicken skin with WAY too much breading (who breads chicharrones?) and...horseradish? And...honey?  There seemed to be what looked like little balls of chicken salad strewn across the plate as well.  No, I don't want a plate for the leftovers. They're gross. Hey, can I get a kids flat bread?  \"I'm not sure we have marinara...\".   Gee, that's odd because the flatbread pizzas listed on the menu say \"marinara\" and \"roasted red pepper.\"  WHY DOES ALL OF THE BEER TASTE LIKE IPA?  The carnitas were...flavorless, oddly enough?  Sure, some pineapple mixed in with overspiced and overcooked pork, but that's about it.  The flavors of their beers and food are as confused as their waitstaff. Disappointing, would be one word to describe MGB.  I stopped two ladies about to enter and waste their money to redirect them to ANY other restaurant than MGB on the way out. My good deed is done for the day."}
{"text":"Go for the beer and the atmosphere, not for the food, unless you get the pretzel, which was soft, hot, and tasty with the garlic ricotta cheese dip.  We wandered into this place because another place around the corner had nearly a 2 hour wait.  We were seated right away, but it took awhile for a greeting from the waiter.  Beer selection was great and so was the flavor!  We were all happy campers in that boat!  I ordered the fish tacos...3 came in an order, a little over priced for the size, but then again we are in cleveland, so it's not like Mahi is swimming in the lake.  Two tacos were filled full, while the third looked like it was missing half the fillings.   My brother ordered a burger that was supposed to have bacon...however, there was nothing specifying that it was Canadian bacon that was dry as leather and the burger was overcooked...quite a disappointment to say the least."}
{"text":"The brisket burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had.  They serve up some pretty tasty flatbread dishes as well.  Didn't have a chance to hit up the beer selection since I was on an interview dinner (where not a single person of our party of 10 ordered a drink) so cannot comment there besides the list looking extensive.  The Ohio City area pours out energy and being that my visit was on a Tuesday night, I'm gonna say this is THE place to be.  Give it a go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an after dinner drink here with my husband. We both got the seasonal Christmas ale, which was spicy and very good! We sat at bar. Ambiance was casual and fun. Bartenders were laid back and easy to talk to. Heard the beer cheese soup was excellent so we will have to try next time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Good music.  Hostess was ok. Asked for outside table in back- told no seats  -NOT.  Put at a large booth that worked.  Attentive waitress.  Beer was good."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 2.5 stars, but I can't, so it's 3... because it is a brewery and they are the best places on God's green earth, IMO. I have a lot to say, but considering I'm not the world's best writer, not sure if this review will be long or short. We will see...  The layout and location are probably the best things about Market Garden. A large seating area and two pretty big bars. The decor is ok, at least I don't find it cheesy or boring.  The service blows quite hard most of the time. The kids working here seem more concerned with chatting amongst themselves than getting beer and grub for the people they are expecting to leave them a tip. I kinda get the impression that bad service is a badge of honor at some places, especially places that cater to the trendy and/or hipster crowd. I have nothing against either crowd, but I absolutely hate bad service.  The food is decent for a beer bar, not much to complain about there. A touch pricey, but not crazy pricey.  The beer. Well, it's pretty boring and some of them are not good. My palate isn't the best, but it isn't hard to detect brewing flaws in most beers. On top of that, I remember the growler prices being astronomically high. Also high were the guest beer prices; I'm not paying $2 more for a Great Lakes beer when I could walk across the street and get it for the cheaper price. I have had better beer at Nano, but I haven't reviewed that place yet so MG has to stand on its own at this juncture.  I also have mixed feelings about McNulty. It is nothing personal, I don't know the man, but I get the impression from his establishments that it is more about style than substance. Every beer article about Cleveland that I've read has something glowing to say about one or more of his bars, and I'm always wondering why the better breweries in the area are left out. If nothing else, the PR machine is working.   I want to say the last paragraph is critical, but I do appreciate Sam McNulty's desire to dump cash into an area where most people would have avoided. His contribution to OC can not be overlooked and he should be commended for that. I just would like to see more attention placed on the beer and service."}
{"text":"I have now been to Market Garden (I think) five times and have come to find that I really enjoy it for lunch or dinner but don't like it at ALL later in the evening.   The food: Great! I've dined here several times and have always been satisfied. They have tasty cheese plates, tacos, salads, etc. I really like the selection, though the menu is not large. It's just very good quality without being very overpriced.   The beer: Even better! A very decent selection of tasty brews. They have some of their own beers, some of which I have really liked while some were just okay. The overall selection is really solid, though. There's definitely something for everyone!  They also have a fully stocked bar, of course, but it's primarily a great place for beers.   The layout is pretty awesome - two sections upstairs, an outdoor area and a basement! I absolutely love the outdoor seating in the summer - long tables in the sort of German beer house sytle. The whole place is very nicely laid out and is generally enjoyable.  I've also never really had issues with servers when having dinner here - always friendly and decently fast.   So, the reason I can't give this the 5 stars I'd like to give it is that I can't handle the late night environment here. I usually have a good time going out in Ohio City but this bar manages to get so crowded you can't even walk! It's incredibly uncomfortable and ridiculous. I've never been cut so often while trying to get a beer and it's never taken me so freaking long just to get to the bar through the dense crowds! I've also found the service to really suffer in the evenings - I literally stood at the bar for five minutes and got no response from a single bartender once. One guy just washed glasses right in front of me, even though I'd just seen him serve someone else.  They just get so hectic that the bartenders are probably struggling to keep track of everything so I don't even necessarily blame Market Garden for the hot mess that occurs in the evenings but I don't recommend going here after dinner time, basically.  It's just a totally different world from the pleasant brewery of the day time. Great Lakes gets crowded but not like this!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Cleveland when my friends and I decided to check this place out. It's right next to the market, so the location is great too.  Upon arriving, the hostess asked us, \"How can I help you?\" What the hell kind of question is that? I'm here to eat like everyone else! Get me a table FFS! It's the weirdest way I've ever been greeted by a hostess.   Atmosphere is good. Dark and sexy and weird chandeliers all over. I dig that.   Apparently Ohio, and its proximity to the Midwest (some say it is the Midwest), makes it fond of different types of meat and sauerkraut. I'm familiar with sauerkraut, and much to my surprise, they serve deep fried sauerkraut. I'd be hard pressed to find something more delicious, more unhealthy than sauerkraut balls. YUM!  I ordered the mac and cheese with chorizo and well, it was fine but unmemorable.   This place gets three stars. Why? The service was terrible. It took forever to place our food order and it took forever to get our food and an even longer time to get our check. It ended up being a 90 minute lunch. No Bueno."}
{"text":"Totally hip vibe, draws a great crowd.  Tons of local brews.  We grabbed dinner & enjoyed the mussels, burger with a fried egg and the bacon meatloaf.  Next time we are trying the scotch eggs and fried chicken for sure."}
{"text":"First of all, thank you! As someone with several allergies (including gluten and dairy free), I have an extremely difficult time eating out. Market Garden Brewery made ordering so easy and pain free. They have an ordering system that allows the chef to be aware of all allergies to avoid cross contamination. The waitress was very knowledgeable about individual ingredients in each menu item. There is no exclusively gluten free menu, however each order is specially made. Our waitress was stellar and refilled our drinks 9 times. For anyone with allergies, Market Garden Brewery is your place."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of hipster hangouts, but Market Garden is too good to pass up. The beer is great (every few weeks they will come out with new brews). The food is outstanding as well. The Mac & Cheese with pulled pork, Duck Sliders, & Brisket Sandwich are what I have tried thus far. If you go on a weekend expect it to be pretty packed and expect to find some good looking single people."}
{"text":"I like market garden for a lot of reasons. First and most obviously, the beer. They have a great selection of their own brews and I have pretty much liked every one that I have tried. Second, their food. This may be my favorite part of this place. I have been here many times for drinks but just recently enjoyed what they had to offer to eat. If there is one recommendation I could give, it would be to order the chorizo perogies, AMAZING! They are so delicious; I may consider having them for my whole meal next time.   The only downfall (for me) of Market Garden is if you come here in the summer on the weekend, it is crazy! Although they have a great patio, it is packed and it closes at 1 so everyone has to move inside. I actually enjoyed their patio as much in the winter snow since they have a nice fireplace and you can use the snow to keep your beer cold :)  A fun, lively Ohio City bar/restaurant!"}
{"text":"We can for brunch and it was an unseasonably warm day and were able to enjoy their patio, which is larger tables fitted best for larger parties (which we had) . We all started with the mimosa sampler which was perfect for a little Sunday funday taste testing- mango was my favorite. The place is a brewery too so plenty of craft beer options as well-my favorite is the prosperity!   I ordered the beef cheek tacos and Brussel sprouts- they had a lot of options. Tacos were good with fresh ingredients but Brussels were amazing ! I did not order but saw th chicken and waffles and another table which I will be getting next time. My boyfriend thought the eggs Benedict was just okay though. Others ordered the flatbread and burger and no one was disappointed with those choices.   Inside They have a ton of seating- this place is also popular for the late night bar scene and for watching games. Modern decor and cool place to match with the rest of west 25th bars. They also have a brewery location with tours which is on my list to do."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday afternoon for a drink and nosh. The hot pretzel wasn't bad, but not great either. They had a trio of Seinfeld themed holiday ales, and I decided to go with Festivus. I'm by no means a beer drinker, let alone a connoisseur, but I really enjoyed this. It smelled and tasted like gingerbread. Unfortunately my friend ordered the cider, and that tasted like apple juice and an orange flavored Airborne. The service was good, especially after just having walked out on Nano Brew down the block."}
{"text":"I love the food, beer and atmosphere.   Had an amazing summer salad with grilled zucchini and mustard vinaigrette.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a brewery, so I'm inclined to like it. However, this bar lacks the basic elements of a brewery: unique/delicious micro brews, and people that appreciate beer. It's my opinion that the two go hand in hand.  The crowd is a result of the Ohio City \"Renaissance\", that has moved W 6th across the river. I often see people ordering mixed drinks at the bar or even getting bottles of bud light *tear*. It would not shock me to see a dance floor with the next time I go.  The actual building is the best part of the brewery. Spacious---with loads of seats and plenty of tables. Outside, there is a patio right next to the West Side Market that has a brick fireplace for warmth in the winter.  The food is okay---but isn't anything special. The best deal on the menu is the popcorn. The burger is standard but the curried bratwurst seems to look pretty good.  Improve on the beers and this could be four stars."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times but this was the first time for brunch. We went with a party of 13 and they were able to accommodate our large group. A number of us ordered the breakfast burrito and it was delicious.  The potatoes were also nicely cooked.  I also got a mimosa flight.  I expected four shot glass size glasses of mimosas but instead comes this holder with what appears to be four full size mimosas...for only $9!  They were all quite delicious, particularly the raspberry and mango ones.  Their mimosa carafes were only $13 and appeared rather large as well.  The service could have been a bit better.  It wasn't very attentive with 13 people and our server was standing around at the bar at the end of our table much of the time.  They did auto-gratuity of 20% due to the size of our group despite us getting separate checks.  I don't know that I would have done 20% if it were up to me due to the slow service.  The food and drinks were outstanding so I'll let 'em stay at 4-stars.  We will certainly return and most definitely for brunch!"}
{"text":"A good place for both lunch and drinks.  I've been for lunch a few times over the past week and the brisket burger is on point. So good!.  There's a lot of space and it is never as crowded as Town Hall which is nice and I think the food is better. Service is good as well. My only gripe is price and selection for lunch.  The sandwich options are limited and there are no wraps. The entree's are expensive for lunch.  I'm not spending $18-$21 on a lunch entrée.  $18 for pierogies when you when Sokolowski's is down the road isn't reasonable and $17 for mac n cheese is crazy."}
{"text":"This place has to be the worst service in the world. We talked with 4 different people and they all were rude and didn't even acknowledge you. Asked multiple times for refill on my beer and never came. People who work there really seem like they didn't want to be there. Too bad bc this place could really be amazing."}
{"text":"Alas, a burger cooked to perfection. Overall, food is solid and a good beer list too! A great place to watch a game, people watch, and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I love the space in the restaurant.  You first walk into an open plan with large booths and table and 2 bars serving their delicious brews.  Near the second bar you see a rustic fireplace with high tables.    The best part is the outdoor courtyard/patio.  They have long tables with wooden stools, where friends can go and sit out on the patio for a long summer night, full of drinks and whimsical merriment.    We started off with their beer sampler- Blonde Ale, Old School Ale, Pearl St. Ale, Progress Pilner, and a seasonal one (Doghead Milk Chocolate Beer?)  I really enjoyed the Old School, Blonde and Pearl St. Ale.  It's lightly crisp, slightly fruity and refreshing ahh.. :).  We got a pretzel with garlic cream cheese/stone mustard. I loved the garlic cream cheese with the pretzel.  The pretzel was nicely warm and toasty, fresh out of the oven.  However, the pretzel was like any other soft pretzel.  The stone mustard was slightly spicy, but I generally don't like mustard with pretzels.    For the main courses, my friend and I got the Pollo Adobada and MG meat platter.  The Pollo Adobada was DELIGHTFULLY DELECTABLE on my taste buds.  The chicken was moist and tender with the salsa rojo and fresh queso.  The house blended queso ties it all together and provides a bit of savoriness.  It was simple, but all the ingredients put together make it complete and whole :).  It comes with a wonderful side of spicy pickled carrots.  The tacos went well with the blond ale.  The MG meat platter was good, but not as good as the tacos.  The platter had a good ham, not amazing, but good.  I really enjoyed the Slovenian sausage; it has a nice flavor, not too heavy, not too light.  The enjoyed the beef jerky, although not in such small little slices.  It has a good flavor and ever so slightly sweet.  In lieu of the mustard, the platter came with this cherry? preserve that was delicious on the ham!!  Their pickled vegetables were just like any other pickled vegetables, slightly sour, but crunchy.  I need to go back for more tacoss gahhh!!  and beer too :)"}
{"text":"I have been somewhat of a regular to the Market Garden ever since they opened.  And I have to say I love the atmosphere and their beers are top notch.  The Bloody Mary's are also great.    The food however is another story.  I was there with a group of friends this morning for brunch.  Service was great, as usual.  I decided to try the Pastrami Hash.  How they could describe this as hash is beyond me.  The meal consisted of 2 very tiny eggs on top of a huge pile of half cooked (no excuse for this) potatoes and a few small slices of pastrami all for $12.00.  I ended up splitting this meal with a friend who ordered the Mushroom omelette.  The omelette was very good but very small and it came with about 8 small pieces of potato.    If you're looking for a good brunch there are too many other good places to go in the Ohio City/Tremont area."}
{"text":"Man I wanted to give this place a better review because their beer and food is amazing. However, their service was frustrating. We went on the 4th of July and it was busy but not crazy busy. 5-10 minute wait for a table at the door so we sat at the bar. Bartender seem rushed and made absolute minimal conversation.   We got to our table 15 minutes later and ordered all our drinks and food at once to help expedite our time there. A while later our server came back and told us they didn't have 2 of the 3 things we ordered. So we reordered and left our drinks to go out for a smoke. We told our server we were stepping outside and WILL BE BACK.  When we got back all of our drinks were gone. Our server apologized and a different bartender came over to own up to the mistake and offer us a free round of whatever was taken away. A nice gesture but overall it was an extremely frustrating experience.   Again the beer was superb and the brisket burger was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Fried chicken sandwich and tacos were also delicious.   We were traveling from Michigan to Massachusetts and did not intend to spend over 2.5 hours at this brewery. Will try a different location next time we make this drive."}
{"text":"Great place. Very nice inside. Love the outdoor patio in the summer time.  The mussels are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Market Garden the other night with my boyfriend and it was slow for a Thursday but who cares. I wanted to enjoy my first beer outside under the heat lights but they weren't on. The host was nice enough to cut them on for us. Coming back inside, we sat at the bar and ordered a beer flight. Service was quick and the bartender was very helpful. Huge beer list. I also order the Pink Elephant cocktail. Nothing special & certainly not strong. For food we got the peppercorn rib eye which was AMAZING!!!! Please eat the mashed potatoes. The truffle Mac and cheese with mushrooms were orgasmic. We will be returning."}
{"text":"First a disclaimer -- I'm not a beer drinker -- so I can only appreciate this place slightly more than a diabetic can enjoy The Chocolate Bar.  But, when we stopped there last Sunday, I did find the food to be above average with the chef showing a deft hand on what are normally just run-of-the-mill bar food. For instance, the pecan wood-smoked chicken tacos ($12) was not overwhelmed by the mango salso and julienned jicama, the red chili aioli nor the chihuahia cheese. The smoked chicken was the dominate taste with the other items dancing on and off my taste buds.   Jeannene had the wild mushroom tacos ($11) and she also seemed to be impressed by them. I took her word for it since I dislike mushrooms even more than beer.  If we hadn't just filled up with movie theater popcorn while watching Star Wars, we probably would have tackled some of their heavier fare. The maple roasted turkey sandwich with tarragon mayo ($12) almost tempted me as did the crispy pan-seared Atlantic salmon ($19).  The atmosphere is typical of the modern bar/gastropub with both booths and long tables to go with the bar seating. It can get noisy/exciting right before or after a big game across the bridge but that's not exactly a bad thing."}
{"text":"My man and I went in on a Wednesday night for a few drinks and an appetizer. The place was packed. We sat down at the bar and waited a few minutes before anyone came over to us. The other service staff was rushing around and no one really looked up at us or acknowledged our presence. The bartender that took care of us was pleasant and got the job done. We ordered the Brewmaster's Platter of meat and cheese. It was decent, heavy on the pate and mushy bratwursts. I would have liked to see some dried meats. My partner tried the pale ale which was nothing special, but drinkable nonetheless. Their wine list is pretty scant which I guess is expected being that it is a brewery. I wasn't overly impressed, but will definitely give it another go this summer and take advantage of their amazing patio."}
{"text":"The beer is good but the food is pretty bad. The pork chop was dry and butchered so there was little meat on it.  The waiter sprayed the table down with a cleaning agent so he sprayed us too. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"If Market Garden was in my neighborhood I'd be happy to call it by neighborhood dwelling place. A quick beer, a nice lunch or just a great place to hang out with some friends and enjoy the afternoon sun.   MGB has a great beer list with what I'd call a 'cute' beer list. It takes me so long to order my first selection because I feel the need to read every single word on the menu. Once I can get past the look, I finally order my delicious beer. I love their brown ale and also the couple of stouts I have tried. The 6 tastings is perfect if you just don't know where to start!   We have also ordered food on numerous occasions and it's been so good every time. I enjoy the shrimp and chicken tacos and for the price, I feel it's fair for what you get. I leave full so I can't complain, right? They are fresh with some great ingredients & my tummy is happy.    My favorite thing though: brewmasters platter & a taster. Perfection! Just make sure you grab a seat outside, this ties it all together."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. We had a bunch of appetizers. I loved their seasoned rice, along with the flank steak! As far as the appetizers, the Chorizo Cheddar Pierogis were the best! They are so cheesy inside, and then topped off with cheese sauce!"}
{"text":"I never wrote a review for Market Garden Brewery, but this is a redemption review for me. Market Garden is one of those really cool breweries that looks really nice, and probably has a very appealing menu for most people- but as a vegetarian, my original visit was pretty disappointing.   As I'm sure most vegetarians can relate with, we tend to become experts on veggie burgers. Often this means a frozen Garden Burger patty, so I always appreciate when a restuarant actually cooks up their own offering. Market Garden's prior veggie patty was quinoa based, which sounded good on paper, but was lackluster in practice. For that reason, I planned to avoid it on my second visit, but realized a new sweet potato burger was on the menu- so much better! In addition to my tasty burger, the beer menu has a great selection, and my friend enjoyed her chicken and waffles.  Though I still would like to see Market Garden Brewery extend their veggie options a bit, I was definitely much happier with my second visit!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Upbeat, trendy decor. - Outdoor patio and additional outdoor seating in the back. - Chicken Caesar Salad was not overly-dressed and the chicken was well-cooked. - Beer flights!  Cons: - The website stated there was parking on-site, but we couldn't find it."}
{"text":"Go for drinks and a cool patio!!! Food not so much.... I would go back for the ambience indoors and outdoors. The patio is awesome w long community style wooden tables and well put together. The service very very very slow! The beer selection is plentiful but the food meh... We ordered a salad(3.5/5), chicken tacos(2.5/5).  Again, while the staff was nice when they finally made it to our table initially and throughout the night, everything took a long time to get to our table."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten, and an awesome selection of beer. Outdoor patio is one of the best in Cleveland, hands down. Service was extremely slow though."}
{"text":"I've visited place a couple of times since my last review. I have to compliment myself on really judging correctly on this place. Their food is so not good. I have had turrkey sandwich and black bean sot tacos couple time since, sometimes to stay other times carryout.. overpriced and all I have to say is fuck this place. They have a decent pilsner going other than that really fuck this place."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic place! We sat outside on the patio on the windiest day of the year. Hold your menus & napkins people! Shit was flying everywhere. The food was great. I got the Breakfast Burrito-Eggs, Creme Fraiche, Cheddar Cheese, Potatoes, Hollandaise, Chorizo, Poblano and Home Fries. There's a lot goin' on in that tortilla. And how could I forget about the Bloody Marys-there's a cocktail weiner in there! I popped inside to use the restroom and the rest of the restaurant was super nice. I would love to come back to try their cocktails and sample some supper time treats."}
{"text":"First time in a long time. Food was definitely better than the last time. Diverse beer selection. Nice patio and a good place to watch an OSU game."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday, late afternoon, for an early dinner. The restaurant did not appear to be particularly busy, so why was the service so lousy? The hostess just stared at us in lieu of a greeting; we then waited close to ten minutes for a waiter to come by.  The Cyclist Soda beer was pretty tasty and the chicken tacos were good.  Overall, it's a nice space but I am unlikely to hang out here very often. How about putting a little more money into training the staff to give a damn and less money on fancy beer pulls?"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, but not mind-blowing. Great selection of local beers, very friendly staff, and very unique menu choices. I was feeling strangely like Canadian and Mexican so I had poutine and tacos. The poutine was pretty good but it felt like it was missing something. Tacos were very good too but the portion felt a bit small. I would certainly come again to try more things though."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating with a giant fireplace, good beer list, good music, good place to have fun with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped for a beer at the bar and no one even acknowledged us. The bar was dirty and no one cleaned off. We left. I guess that's why no one was there but Town Hall and Great Lakes are packed."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered anything bad here yet.   Favorites: the pretzel, their beer, shrimp tacos"}
{"text":"Festivus, Oktoberfest and Cluster Fuggle IPA are great beers.  Others I've had have been solid - I just prefer IPA and seasonals.  Their food is also consistently good and atmosphere (patio especially) is great.  Service, on the other hand, is often slow.  I think it's mainly because they're so packed all the time (-1 star for this alone).  Perhaps its time to bring another server on? Another note I have to mention is they gave me two $50 gift cards to support the American Cancer Society fundraiser I was helping out with.  This is a great local business which I frequent with friends."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up for a few beers before, or after your dinner.  I'm not exactly sold on their food.  Nothing on the menu screamed \"ORDER ME\" and the items my group did order fell far from wowing anyone.  I applaud the herculean effort put in by the owner and staff on opening this place, but something just didn't transfer from the other side of the street.  Which is a shame.  The positive side is that CLE has fully embraced this place, and the things I didn't like can be easily fixed with some tweaks."}
{"text":"Ok folks... my first experience was crappy soley because of the beyond terrible waitress.  Our next excursion, we got a waitress that was so awesome, that it put the original waitress out of our minds forever.  (OK, I can still picture her ridiculous and failed attempt to copy Zoey Deschanel's haircut.)    Seriously... the food was excellent, the waitress ATTENTIVE, and our experience much much more enjoyable.  I will return.  If I see Zoey coming, I'm requesting a new table."}
{"text":"Great beer.  Great atmosphere.   You will love this place.  This is now our go to place on west 25th street."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out, have a couple beers, and enjoy some yummy food. We come here a lot just to drink on the weekends, or for brunch on Sundays, but this time we stopped in for lunch after some shopping at West Side Market. It was a beautiful day, so we sat out on their patio. Jack Johnson music played in the background as we sipped our beers, perfectly shaded by a little tree growing between the tables. I got the Old School American Lager, which was light and refreshing.   To eat, I had the eggplant sandwich and my boyfriend got the tofu cheesesteak. The eggplant sandwich was awesome, but messy. The whipped feta on the sandwich was delectable, and the eggplant was perfectly grilled.  I also got a salad instead of fries, and the salad was very good, much better than my boyfriend's fries. The tofu cheesesteak sandwich was also pretty good but my boyfriend did comment that he wished the tofu was crispier.   Market Garden is a great place. They have an awesome beer selection and the food is pretty great too. If its nice out, I'd definitely recommend hanging out on their patio."}
{"text":"We really wanted to go to the brewery across the street but they had a long time. But this place DID NOT disappoint! They were able to seat us quickly and serve our food and beverages! They have a variety of beers to satisfy a crowd. Food is mainstream bar food. I had some fish tacos which were good! It's right next door to the market for some dessert or after drinks shopping!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place to eat! There's a huge variety of awesome beers brewed in house, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the food knocks it out of the park.  Situated right next to the west side market, these guys make great use of their space. Both the outdoor and indoor seating spaces are comfortable and lively. It's great to see the foot traffic of Ohio City passing by as you enjoy a few beers and a meal with friends.   While the entrees are delicious, it's the small plates that really set this restaurant apart for me. The cheese board and the scotch eggs are personal favorites.  Great restaurant for a few friends or a larger group. I'd recommend it every time."}
{"text":"Food = 1 star plus a generous extra star as I appreciate craft beer. Do not eat here after 8pm as they will aggressively begin clearing your table at 9pm. Also do not order the beer cheese soup in the evening; the taste is similar to that of movie theatre nacho cheese."}
{"text":"I've been to MGB a few times but have never tried the food. The beer selection seems impressive, and since I am a tall boy and bottle kinda person, getting it in a glass is fancy.   I have always attended shindigs in the Ohio City room, which is downstairs, with seating and its own bar. This place seems to like to be in touch with the community. Edible Cleveland, a local food/ brainstorming group has done stuff there before, and last night there was one of a series of comedy showcases there. Any place that supports the diverse groups that make up this town gets my support too. Hence the 4. Again, the beer selection is fancy- not cheap- but the staff is friendly. I'll be back for more of the comedy I suppose."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch yesterday - regularly come here at other times of the day. This was the first and last time I will never go here for brunch! Quick to get seated and ordered but the rest was downhill. We had a table of 4 - ordered the breakfast burrito, eggs Benedict, mushroom omelet and the 3 eggs breakfast. The only meal that was even remotely good was the breakfast burrito. Eggs Benedict had a dash of hollandaise and the eggs were over poached. The omelet was dried to the point that if it had been cooked any longer it would've burnt. For my three eggs breakfast how can you go wrong?! Well you can here..I ordered my eggs fried/over hard and they were served over easy and my bacon was RAW - still cold. Disgusting. To top it all off, people who had gotten there 30 minutes after our group were being served first. Stick to lunch, dinner and drinks at this joint."}
{"text":"Service was great everyone was nice..I had fried chicken sand which vehicles was a bit tough to bite into. Other the that no complaints food was hot when it came out."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place on the weekdays for beer and late night eats. However, on this weekends, this place becomes a bro bar. (It's just beyond me how someone can come to a microbrewery and order Bud Light, Jack and Coke, Long Island, etc.) If that's not your scene, and you're just there to try the beer and food (or you actually want to be able to talk without shouting), I recommend avoiding Friday and Saturday nights. The pretzels are amazing, and so are the duck sliders and tacos, but I still prefer Bier Markt in general (better bartenders and less of a meat market atmosphere), but like to mix in a visit to Market Garden every once in a while."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, and a variety of food choices.  beers are top quality, and we have never been disappointed with the food.  Sunday brunch gives some different options as well. The service is sub par though, both times ive been here its been slow and very half assed. Kind of like they want you in and out as quickly as possible. dont worry i wont be back so its one less customer you need to hurry out the door"}
{"text":"I really do like this place - but am slightly P.O.'d it is so popular - I live too far away to get there in time for the patio. And, Oh, the patio looks glorious.  Maybe I'll quit my job for a day and be standing at the door when they open? Good plan.  I have been to Market Garden several times and give the beer 2 big thumbs up! I've had the pale, wheat, IPA, and several of the beer cocktails.  Maybe it is just me (it can't be just me...) but I think the IPA is my favorite because I like to say clusterfuggle! Seriously, \"beer me\" is so last year, now I say \"clusterfuggle me!\"  And I am delighted each time.  I think my friends also tried the stout and the bicycle lemonade beer and were happy.  The food is also pretty darn good. The fries are delicious and I would rank them high on my list of fries list (let's be real, we all have fries lists!).  All of the tacos get two big thumbs up from me, with the pork always being my go-to! I had a crab po' boy and I would say it was just OK, lacked a little pizzaz and I felt like more bites just tasted like the bun than anything else.  People I have gone with have enjoyed the burgers and the pulled pork.  My fiance got the fried chicken sandwich and I have not seen him eat anything that absurd in a long time.  I will say the service is just \"meh...\" - hard to crack a smile or an ounce of enthusiasm out of the hostesses/weight staff which does slightly ruin the experience for me.  Also, if you go, please steal me the giant BEER sign in lights over the bar for my place. Thank you in advance."}
{"text":"We just Had a few drinks in the beer garden area. No problem getting a seat about 11pm Saturday night. Although it was a bit annoying that 80% of people were smoking. Had to move tables to avoid the stinky smoke!"}
{"text":"Simply put, I LOOOOVE their food!!   I came here with a fairly large group, and they reserved the entire bottom floor for us!  For starters, I got the poutine. It was my first time trying poutine in the States, and I loved it!   I was deciding between getting the market garden burger or the mustard & buttermilk fried chicken as my entree, and I think I made the best decision of my life. The mustard & buttermilk fried chicken was absolutely MIND-BLOWING! The grits that came with it had BACON in it!! There were so many different savory flavors in the dish--it was seriously a freakin party in my mouth.   I recommend this place without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed by this place. Went on a Wednesday about 730 and there was no wait. We asked to and got seated on the back patio. Everyone loved the ambiance back there. There were a lot of massive heaters which I'm sure are great on chilly days in the fall or spring. And a massive outdoor fireplace that they had lit by the time we left. The service was just fine.   I had the Trouble and really loved it, right down my alley. Other people got IPAs and really liked them too. We got the chips with the two salsas and guacamole as an appetizer. It was very good. It was obvious the chips were made in house. I really loved the salsa verde. It didn't last long between four people. I had the bbq brisket sandwich with fries and it was delicious. That bread worked perfectly with it. I don't know what it's called but it was very buttery and held up just right. And the fries were very good. Better than your average side of fries, I would have been happy with them as an appetizer.  Everyone cleaned their plates and talked about when we can come back again. However we wouldn't choose to sit at on of the tables on the back patio again because of the bar stools. When you spend hours on those things they aren't so comfortable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed bunch at the Market Garden Brewery on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The place was hopping with customers and beer selection, many runners celebrating a successful Cleveland Marathon. We had a short wait of approximately 10 minutes before being seated. Too bad the patio was closed due to rain, sure the wait would've been even shorter.   Huge selection of beers on tap, guessing 15 made by Market Garden and a few guest beers from other brewers. I went for the Boss Lager, Vienna style lager, that hit the spot. With all of the different styles of beer and thier unique taste notes it is refreshing to see a brewery able to make a great classic style brew. For the non beer drinkers thier is a full bar service, saw a lot of Mimosa's leaving the bar.  Our brunch food selection was as follows- Deviled Egg to start and a Beet Salad with roasted Chicken for my wife while I went for the Breakfast Burrito. The Deviled eggs were a hit and we'll order them again. The Beet Salad was the surprise of the day, nice portion with roasted and Beet chips, goat cheese and well dressed. My Burrito was alright, I was hoping for more peppers and spice and less potatoes, there were potatoes on the inside of the Burrito and on the side.   Market Garden is definitely the place to come down for lunch, brunch, dinner or brews! Great location next to the West Side Market, well brewed beers, tasty selection of food and a cool vibe."}
{"text":"The beer is very good, try the sampler (we went with the 8-4 is also an option) so you can try more of the beers on the menu in a sample size.  I personally loved \"Trouble\" which is brewed with honey.  The large pretzel is as large as a toddler's arm and comes with both stone ground mustard and garlic ricotta cheese.   If possible, and if the weather allows, ask to sit outside in the back beer garden.   It has large tables and overhead lights and heaters for when the weather turns cool (looked like a fire pit was out there as well) the service was good and there were lots of choices on the menu (including meatless options)   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!  Love the patio and all the options for seating  Also, im not a beer drinker but the wine list was great. Placed an order for food around 1130 which they got wrong but they were so nice an accommodating about fixing it that I didn't mind at all.  All in all, for my first visit to market garden was pretty awesome.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Market garden brewery is actually  a pretty cool looking in place inside with a nice sized bar located in the front as well as another fairly big bar located in the back of the establishment as well. There's also plenty of seating here too and is another option for dining when in the area if your craving a pub style dinner.  The beer here however was ok. I wasn't digging the variety or taste of it for that matter. I do however like the fact it's a local microbrew with just their brews on tap (no mega chain beers on tap)  The food was decent for the few appetizers we tried, but again I had some better tasting ones in the vicinity. Maybe it was just our preference, but by no means was it the worst I ever had.  Maybe I'll stop on in again sometime and see if they offer a few new seasonal beers and give those a try."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on Sunday. Not too busy, the weather stunk. I was able to easily alter our reservation at Open Table, which is a great service. The food was pretty amazing. Best deviled eggs I've ever had, & the beingets & raspberry sauce were sweet & crispy. I had the cheese omelet which was solid, my husband had the apple granola pancakes with a side of bacon which he thoroughly enjoyed, & our friend had the poutine. It was served in a silver trough & would be great for a hangover. On top of all the great food, they have great beer, mimosas & Bloody Mary's. It was a difficult decision. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"DO:  Order the burger! And/or the chicken tacos.   Go on a weekday for lunch or a late dinner, if you like good service and a chill but fun vibe! Sitting in the giant booths is fun and they'll be open at these times.  Do NOT:  Go here on a Saturday night. I prefer to have a conversation when I'm out with my friends. We are musicians who don't have 9-5 jobs, so we tend to forget that weekends are different from weekdays, and we've tried to come here several times on a Saturday night, ALWAYS regretting it. If you like crowds, loud music, and drunk people, however, Saturday night is when you should go!  --  I want to try everything else on the menu. I'm not super impressed by the brews, but that's okay. In sum: four solid stars. I'll be back many a time while I'm in Cleve!"}
{"text":"Get the avocado toast for brunch. Generous avocado mash, topped with fresh tomatoes and red chili flakes. So delicious. They treat it right, frying the bread in butter before they top it with fixin's. Amazing. :) the other foods that we have had were good, but nothing to write home about.   The beers! Oh the beers!! The beers are a reason to make a journey to the establishment alone. Get a flight. Try all their House-made delicious beers for less than ten bucks.   I will admit that we typically do not frequent market garden for eats, but rather for the beers and drinks. :) the night scene, when not crowded, is quite fun! It can get a little grungy on the weekends though, so beware.   Decent service, friendly bartenders. Solid three stars."}
{"text":"The beer variety is great, and I got the flight to try 4 different kinds. The service is attentive and friendly. My favorite thing about this place was that they do play music, but at a normal volume! They don't blast it at you like most bars do, causing you to scream at your friends so they can hear you. The food was okay, I tried the chicken skin and it didn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"Second inspection update: MGB still gets 3 stars from this girl.   They need some work in the food department.   But... you should still go there right about now and try their Pumpkin Ale while it's still available. It's a good one."}
{"text":"Market Garden Brewery was the 3rd stop on our little brewery tour. What a great place! I loved it! This is one of my favorite stops of the night.   We had no issue getting a table for the 10 of us outside. I had a flight of beer and they were all great. They actually have decent sized flights. Either that, or I'm just disillusioned by the glass. That's probably it.   We ordered Poutine for the table. It was just OK. I've had better, but I love all forms of potato.   I'd love to go back and try other beer as well as more food."}
{"text":"If it were not for the beer my review whb a 1. How do you sell tacos and run out OF QUESO at 1 PM?  The tacos were Luke warm on arrival. The wait staff was somewhat attentive but unfriendly.  Why be unfriendly??  No excuse. Get another job."}
{"text":"Take my advice and do not do a buffet if you go there with a group for a team dinner. Salami and blue cheese with a veggie plate as well as crappy tacos. Maybe who ever put the order in was a bit off. However, if the food had tasted good it would have been so bad. The beer is good and they pour s pretty good mixed drink."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous!!!! They have a beautiful indoors and an even better patio. Great idea for date night. They have a wide selection of beers. We got 2 different samplers and tried their flavors. Loved all of the samplers. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious restaurant. I came here after a Browns game with my boy friend. We were seated right away and ordered some beers. The environment is nice and cozy. It's dimly lit and has a classy, but comforting vibe. The chandeliers and wood tables and chairs go well together.   I ordered the Ohio Beef Burger with fries. It was cooked the way I like and the fries were great. I definitely would like to come back to try their other food. The location is right in the heart of Ohio City too. If it's a nice night, it's really nice to walk around for a little to digest and take in the city!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Chicken sandwich was great. The black IPA was ok."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a birthday party with a group of close to 25 people.  A reservation was required for a group of this size.  The space is extremely big with plenty of tables, three llarge bar areas, an outdoor seating area (with fully functioning wood burning fireplace) and plenty of large screen TV's around.  The place is also dog friendly!  There are plenty of their beers on tap here.  Many different styles as well, IPA's, DIPA's, Pale Ales, Porters, Wheat Beers and seasonal beers (Marzen was on tap when I visited), Pumpkin beer and Stouts (I am sure there were a few more as well).    The food menu was fairly standard for a brew pub, but the quality was much better than many places I have been.  Since we were a large party, we had plenty of appetizers lining our table before sitting down for dinner.  The flatbreads and wings were really good, cooked nicely and not overdone, the flavors were spot on.    Despite being such a large group, the service was spot on.  Quick, efficient and prompt.  No one was ever waiting around for a refill on alcohol and our food came out in a timely manner.    Overall, this is a great place.  I enjoyed sitting outside as it was a mild evening, but the outside filled up quickly.  Despite the place being so big, it will get crowded and tables/seats can be harder to come by.  I will definitely visit this place again for sure."}
{"text":"We came for the beer and will come back for the food. The food was amazing and a pleasant surprise. The beer is the icing on the cake at this place."}
{"text":"This brewery has an awesome vibe, great beer and tasty food! I went there last night for a friend's birthday. I had the pumpkin ale (amazing) and the pulled pork sandwich (even better!) Because it was a special occasion we also got the pumpkin spice ice cream which was pretty good...but not as awesome as it sounds. I will definitely come back here...awesome place for a casual dinner and tasty beer!"}
{"text":"Lately I have become an OC(Ohio City) HH(Happy Hour) turn into night time fun offender.   Before Market Garden opened I had heard rave reviews from a coworker who won a beer naming contest. So the week it opened I felt I had to try it out. Loved it! Not only for the beers they offer but for the food! They really know what they are doing. Although I would hope so since the owner has had a little bit of history in the business.  The menu isn't extensive but everything is well worth it. The spicy veggie tacos are delicious pared with the Market Salad. I have mostly been there to drink and after a few usually go for something on the Pub Fare menu. Recently I've tried the Homemade Tortilla Chips and the Pretzel (can't go wrong there).  Now for the beer. Since it has the high standards of the GLBC crowd...I think MGB has done a stand up job with their beer selection and choices. I'm a fan of many.   Top Picks: Pearl Street Wheat, Cluster Fuggle and the Fall Porter. Also try the Progress Pilsner if you like something light or for the holiday season the Festivus Ale... soooo good!!!!  So get your arse to the OC for HH and enjoy one of our newest brew spots!!! (Don't forget to check out the heated tables and fireplace out back!...)"}
{"text":"I went to Market Garden Brewery on a Sunday for brunch. I was intrigued with there different flavors of mimosas. First after seating down on the back patio, I was feeling the vibe, and thought this would be a new place for brunch. Until it took a while for my waitress to show up..  she finally came.   Received my food and it was ok, but not great. I have had better chicken and waffles but doable. The service was the problem.. my waitress barely came back to the table and every time i asked her for something she seemed as if i was bothering her! I asked for regular syrup and she told me only the bourbon syrup exist in which i know i saw regular Ohio maple syrup on the menu. I had to ask another waitress for the regular syrup. That also caused a problem because my significant other doesn't drink. What if he needed the regular maple syrup and not bourbon, and you could definitely taste the bourbon in the syrup! Which is why i didn't want it, tasted like straight alcohol."}
{"text":"Stopped in after checking out West Side Market. Nice patio in the back, but the ashes from stove & smokers seated next to us took away from ambience. They offer reasonably-priced flights of four beers. The pumpkin and chocolate beers were both delicious. Wasn't a fan of the burger.. Thin, greasy patty with a soggy bun.. Not worth the price compared to nearby places. I'd stop here to drink, but probably not to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work with friends. Pretty mediocre bar/food experience sadly. Eggplant sandwich was unfortunately the worst I've ever eaten. Next time will have to try the veggie burger option. Not sure what has happened to MGB, it's been better In the past. Hopefully just an off night."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. If you want to have a beer outside in good weather I would recommend this place. If you want to have a meal with friends this is not the place. I went for a birthday party this past weekend. We had a reservation for a group. Getting a beverage took 30 min, getting food took an hour and a half. The server was sympathetic but the food isn't at all worth the wait. The chicken sandwich was dry and lacked flavor. It's unfortunate because the space would be a great place to host a gathering of the service and food was up to par."}
{"text":"\"Great place, good atmosphere, eh on the food.\"  This has been a great new addition to Ohio City / w25th street. The place is really spacious; 2 bars and a large patio so there is plenty of space to hang out and move around. The place is very clean and the wait staff has been very friendly every time I've been there. The beer selection is wide, and all of their in house brews are solid--nothing overly impressive but nothing disappointing as of yet.  My only negative is the food. I have not been impressed with the food at all--flavors are bland and the food definitely doesn't match up well to other establishments on the same street. This would generally bump my rating down to 3 stars but I'm giving it 4 for the good atmosphere (this will primarily be a watering hole for me)."}
{"text":"This place has become one of our go-to places in Ohio City; Whenever we're not sure about where to go we always pick this place. The food and the service are both great, and we love the vibe of the place. The Scotch Eggs and the chorizo pierogies are my favorite apps, and for lunch I like getting the eggplant sandwich because it's not too heavy, but it's super flavorful. Love this place!"}
{"text":"High-five, Cleveland. Trendy street full of yummy, creative, graphically-pleasing restaurants and bars.  We arrived 15 min early to our reservation, but got sat right away. Our server also accommodated the baby we were with, (and even had an extra tall, wood high chair to accompany the high bar tables we were at).   Atmosphere: dim, trendy, casual   Food: loved the menu. I was between the brisket sandwich, mushroom flatbread, and carnitas tacos. I got the carnitas tacos and they came with jalapeños and guacamole, and had pineapple salsa in the tacos. They came with three, all on flour tortillas. My mouth is still watering.   Didn't get to try the beer but they have a cool bar area and I would definitely come back for their bier garden on a nice day."}
{"text":"We have stopped in here for a pint and a snack a few times now and each time it's been consistently great.  The service is quick and genuinely friendly.  You generally see the owner working to help the staff as well, which is a gesture that goes a long way with this service industry veteran. The patio looks warm and welcoming and I look forward to sitting out there soon, I wonder if they allow pups?  It's a great place to stop for a bite and a beer after the WSM on Saturdays and it's also got a vibrant nightlife.  Great addition to Ohio City."}
{"text":"The worst steak I've ever eaten in my life. Below Applebee's quality. Ribeye was cooked in a way that was flavorless, well-done on the inside and fat was slimy on the outside. The potatoes that came on the side were not cooked and crunchy. The wing appetizer was pretty good but everything was overshadowed by how awful the steak was. My fault I guess for ordering a steak here."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and every time there seems to be something that isn't quite right.  Mostly, I have returned because it was open later than other places.  The decor is hip and modern, and it's great to see a space as open.    However, the drink selection, especially for being what this bar is known for, is pretty run of the mill.  The food is hit or miss.  The wait staff is often very pretentious and, although accommodating to their customers' needs, they appear to be inconvenienced by their patrons .  This is also definitely a place which has the atmosphere and space to have live music, and they don't!  Such a waste of what could be really fabulous.   Come for the atmosphere with some friends, but otherwise, there are other places to be."}
{"text":"Summed up in a couple words: Absolutely Yum. Try their Pearl Street Wheat if you like a wheaty beer, I always get this  This time went with the bf for Sunday brunch which is from 10-3 ~ HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  We had their fried chicken waffles and poutine (INCLUDES BACON!! ^^) to share as well as a Yucatan marinated pork tacos for him and a medium Market garden Ohio beef burger + egg for me. Everything was completely delicious. Probably the weakest of the four was the tacos. The Fried chicken waffles were soooo deliciously paired with red eye syrup, the seasoning on the chicken was enough for me to order just the chicken if I could in the future. My Ohio beef burger patty was cooked perfectly and the BACON inside was a scrumptious surprise. There are soft cooked onions inside so if you're worried about nasty onion breath, no need to worry here. It's a 1/2 lb burger so definitely get it if you're Hungry.  Can't wait to come again! Will definitely have to try more of their beers next time, but I can't ever get past getting at least 1 *tall glass of their Pearl Street Wheat. & Service is great. Our waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"What a wonderfully decorated and warm building this is, on one of the up and coming streets in Cleveland!  The service was very fast and catered well for a 1 year old as we were eating out with family.  The food was excellent too, with a wide range menu that caters for all.  There was 5 of us eating out and all 5 meals were different and came to us at the same time , all perfectly cooked. 5/5 I would definitely recommend and 100% visit again if I were in Cleveland"}
{"text":"In the heart of Cleveland, Market garden Brewery has a really good location. Good beer selection. They are exploring a lot with different styles of beers. We had the frosty, which is a good refreshing beer. Hints of spicy Belgian yeast, lime tartness. And also the Citramax IPA. American citra Hops forward."}
{"text":"Rude rude rude hostess. Red headed hostess was so rude to my mother in law that we almost left. Beer was good but food wasn't. Mac and cheese was ok. But the hostess set the tone for a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Love this bar in Cleveland! They have a variety of house made beers that are really good and a full bar! The back patio is also great because they heat it, which is good for Cleveland's ever changing weather.   Also make sure you get a picture in front of the beer and spirits signs indoors! They also have a mural they change out on the side of the building that you need to take a sneak at (before I sign sign, reasons I'm Cleveland mural, etc)"}
{"text":"The beer was pretty good and pretty good food.  The table service can be a tad bit slow in my first experience but nothing too bad.  They have their own beer which is really good and also have bottle of other craft beers that are always good selections as well.  Great when you can get out on the patio and have a great ti.e  Cool place I will return in the further"}
{"text":"Lack of bartenders on a weekend night. As a bartender in the city it was very disappointing to see the lack of attentiveness when I was waiting for a drink. The two bartenders at the front bar were too busy flirting with each other to notice me along with the 3 other people holding money up to get their attention. The people in the back bar were at least a little more attentive but after ordering drinks walked around in circles and took almost 20 minutes to make our drinks. DEFINITELY not a staple bar to do to in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Particularly on a Saturday night, this place should be called \"Meat Market\" Garden Brewery. Geez, I guess it's tough being single these days. The Saturday crowd here looks like cattle in an auction.  I do quite like the weekday happy hour vibe here, however. Much more toned down.  This place is huge, the beer (some of it) is OK, and the food is, well, just not that great. And I emphasize that only SOME of the beer is OK. None of it is great, and some of it is terrible. I will note the Market Garden Centennial IPA, which smelled like cat pee in a litter box, and tasted mostly like \"essence of hops\" (not a good thing). They've got a LOOOONG way to go in the food department (every dish I tasted was unremarkable), and a slightly less long way to go in the beer department.   Skip dinner, have an app and a (bottled) beer at the bar on a Tuesday for happy hour."}
{"text":"Wonderful patio! Love this time of the year in Cleveland where we can soak up the outside seating. Thoroughly enjoyed my Pesto Mac and Cheese. This was not on the menu online, but when we arrived saw it listed! So this was a nice surprise. Would get again. My husband enjoyed his Brisket Burger. Said it was very juicy and he would get it again as well. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Came in on a Saturday around 1p for lunch. Had a 30 minute wait which is expected in this area around lunchtime.  Ordered apps and beers at the bar, recommend the broccolini.  Got seated an ordered a burger.  The order took nearly an hour to come out and the burger was cold.  Disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Chorizo Joe sandwich was delicious, great chips too. Only recommendation is to go after the Westside Market is closed if you're going to sit on the patio.  It's a great patio, but not the most appealing view if you're watching the market close down for the day."}
{"text":"Really a cool place to try flights of craft brews. Atmosphere is hopping.   Pretty good food.   Enjoyed the experience.  Recommend you try this place if you like craft beers, when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Should've stuck with citramax  Mushroom pizza a little sandy  Slow service to make you pay for parking  Went to old fashion hot dogs after  No senses pleased in there  Come onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"}
{"text":"Market Garden was okay, good beer selection, but the food was meh. I got the chicken sandwich and the bun was so much bigger than the chicken itself, so the first two bites were just bun. The service was also kind of meh. The waitress was nice, but she got me another beer without asking which was annoying because I didn't want that same beer (I know I should have said something, but I hate complaining). Also, one person in our party got their food much later than the other 12 people we were with, and it was just a salad (which according to the waitress doesn't come with bacon anymore, although the menu says it does). I'd give it another shot in the future, but wasn't wowed the first time around."}
{"text":"I'm getting pretty damn tired of over-hopped beers that are not even true to style.  Great American lager that has very noticeable hops, a pilsner that is hoppy.  What is this??  I understand that the American beer palate is very skewed towards hoppy beers.  I understand that.  But can you make ONE beer that is not hoppy?  Can you not disdain us beer drinkers that like a clean, crisp non-hoppy beer?  Just one is all I ask.  Until then I will buy a bottle or can of a non-local beer and not at your establishment.  It's a shame because the ambiance is great, the space is great, and you have an enthusiastic, if not very informed staff.  The polish will come with time and effort.  I hope the beers follow suit..."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I visited Cleveland. Low on seating so we stayed at the bar, I put down a few scotch ales which were very good. For dinner we split the scotch eggs and pork slides which were REALLY good. It has been awhile since I have put food that tasty in my mouth, that's for sure. Really happy with my experience and the prices were OK. I will come back if / when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Good food and good beers in a casual/ trendy restaurant. Our waitress was a little odd and the place was a bit loud downstairs, but everything else was swell. I was impressed with my beef tacos. They were loaded with brisket and were pretty tasty tacos for being served at a brewery in Ohio. In fact I think everyone I was with enjoyed their meals. My blueberry wheat bear was really good as well. I'm interested in coming back to try the brunch menu."}
{"text":"It's rare that I do this, but alas, I must. Market Garden Brewery, my dear friend, I must remove from you, no matter how painful it is to me, one of your hard-earned stars. For over the last several months I have given you ample opportunity to prove yourself worthy of the crown of my personal fandom and you have faltered.  Before I continue please allow me the chance to elaborate. The decision I have made is in no way a reflection of the beer that is brewed within the fine stainless steel vessels of the Market Garden Brewery. My decision is based solely upon that one critical element upon which most eateries are judged - service.  When I first reviewed Market Garden it was my experience that, while sometimes spotty, the service levels were consistently above average. Water glasses filled, well-paced delivery, attentive wait staff checking in on the progress of the meal and to take the temperature of our ongoing experience. Unfortunately, this trend has seemingly taken a downward slide into the morass of the forgettable.  Yes, the food is still tasty. I've had some minor missteps with missed ingredients and overcooked duck, but who hasn't? I've been willing to let them go. But the service has slid down a slope that I am only hopeful from which they will eventually recover. On our most recent experience the service varied from inattentive to downright complacent. Our server never once stopped back to ask how our meal was going. At one point, 20 minutes elapsed between her visits. To make matters worse, I had a hard time justifying why I should leave any tip at the end of the meal (I did, lest you think me some kind of heathen).  When a server greets you without a smile, no mention of any specials or recommendations of a beer (at a brewery, no less) and hardly makes her presence known over the course of an hour-long dining experience, what is one to think? Her first words to us were \"Oh yeah, and we're out of burgers and chicken.\" How the hell does a popular restaurant run out of burgers and chicken at 6pm on a Sunday?   I still love the beer at Market Garden Brewery. Right now I consider it unfortunate that I can't purchase it in bottles at my nearest retailer. Perhaps I shall return again after the sting of disappointment has dulled. Time will tell."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great beers! One of the best breweries in Cleveland. Can get a little busy on Saturday nights, but very laid back atmosphere all other nights. Patio is great in the summer and the fireplace is cozy in the winter."}
{"text":"Came at 4:30 for the Pumpkin beer event and was seated in the basement because I don't have a reservation. Meanwhile the tables upstairs sit empty for hours with reserved signs. I don't get it. Anyway the pumpkin beer was good. This place cranks the heat so be sure to wear layers."}
{"text":"GREAT space! Decent beer. OK food.  Overall, I like it - it works. I was in awe to see how they've transformed a space I never thought of as being an asset to the neighborhood into something absolutely beautiful. They've clearly put some money into this investment.  The beer is decent for what it is. I don't expect a brand new brewery to crank out absolutely amazing stuff right off the bat - it will take time to get there. I did notice that the prices seemed a bit on the high side, by Cleveland-standards anyway. Though this was even more true for the \"guest beers\" on the menu than for the in-house brews.  I really hope that West 25th isn't turning into the new place where underage kids from the suburbs go \"clubbing\" on the weekend, as some other reviews have suggested. If McNulty can cater to the right crowd, his places will continue to be the best in town."}
{"text":"Feeling kind of indifferent about this place. I came with a group of friends and we initially only went just for drinks, we entered through the back patio and walked to the front to have a hostess seat us. We chose to sit in the back patio outside. My first impression of the place was that it was very lively, there were different groups of people seated outside, of all ages too.   My friends and I sat there for a few minutes reading the drinks menu, deciding on what to order. If it weren't for the guys sitting near us letting us know that we had to order at the bar, we probably would've sat there forever. Anyway, we had one friend go order the drinks inside and brought it out for us (we should have tipped him). A little weird for me though because I always get carded since I look so young, but this time I didn't even have to pull out my ID at all.  Drinks overall were good, no complaints there. We decided we were going to order food (we had to go inside to order food too). I ordered the Naan Wrap, and as much as I wanted to enjoy it - I actually didn't. It didn't taste as good as it looked; the mix of ingredients just didn't blend well and the Naan bread may as well have been just a tortilla wrap (not used to super thin Naan bread). I hate to say that this place was a 'miss' for me. I'd love to give it another try though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on trips to visit family and have loved it both times.   Both times I went during the day time,  sat at the bar and  sampled a few beers and their smaller bites.   The dry-rubbed wings are pretty damn amazing; the meat just fell of the bone.    You can sample beers before you try them to find the right match.  If you can't decide you can always do a flight.   Overall good, chill vibe, good food and beer - sure I'll be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"I love the design and feel of this place. I can't say much for the food since the few times I've been here have primarily been for drinks. What I will say, though, is that the patio is unlike anything else. I have some really great memories of sitting outside and enjoying a nice cold beverage under the big Cleveland sky."}
{"text":"I went here with high hopes of a good Sunday brunch after reading their menu online but was very disappointed.   I ordered the mini pancakes, beignets and deviled eggs.  The mini pancakes were tiny and almost as thin as a crepe plus they were out of the macerated berries so I got preserves instead.  The beignets were so bad I actually sent them back.  The deviled eggs were pretty good mainly due to the candied bacon.  Needless to say, I was still hungry.  My hubby ordered the breakfast poutine which he enjoyed and it seemed filling.  I have a feeling the food here is hit or miss so stick with drinking here and go someplace else for good food.  The restaurant has a cool atmosphere and patio but the service is just so-so (not bad but not friendly either)."}
{"text":"Came here once a a super cold trip to the Market. The Butternut squash soup was incredible. It isn't just the food that makes this place great either, the atmosphere, decor, and overall Ambiance is really great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to eat for a late night dinner and watch the game Cavaliers vs. Raptors. They had a great outdoor seatings;  pretty spacious enough that even with the game on from the TVs, everyone can still have decent conversations without yelling across tables and stretching out their ears.  We ordered mussels and pork sliders. We were told that the food will take about 30 min upon ordering. It's always nice to be informed of the time if it'll take longer than usual. The tomato sauce of the mussels were filled with seafoods such as shrimps and more mussels, which was awesome. The pork sliders were delicious as well.   I can't say much about their drinks. I had a sip of a beer but don't recall which I had nor anything special about the taste. But then I don't know much, if not anything, about beers.  Overall, nice place to hang out with friends over some good food and drinks on a Friday night."}
{"text":"They have a great little eclectic menu. Shrimp tacos and French dip are fantastic. So is the beer selection. Very reasonably priced. Nice ambiance. Very clean and nice interiors. Good music over the sound system. Good crowd. Busy but the staff was very accommodating since we didn't have a reservation. We were in and out in less than an hour.Outdoor patio is nice. Beer selection is great!  I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"beautiful place! the downstairs area is even better. a rustic classic fill. totally enjoyed myself hanging out at the bar with friends on new years eve."}
{"text":"Cool place to go and try either their own beer or other micro brews.  The place is pretty big and has 2 large bars.  There are also plenty of tables and an outside space."}
{"text":"LAME AVOCADO TOAST! $7 for a piece of soggy wonder bread, smucker's jelly, and a quarter of a brown avocado"}
{"text":"So we went there after a game and both of us ordered the tacos.  We have had them before and they were good.  Both tacos were under filled but my walleye tacos were extremely under filled, maybe half filled if I'm optimistic.  I have no idea how these got out of the kitchen honesty.  These were a $14 item folks.  To make matters worse the line cooks didn't compensate for less fish and put the same amount of sauce on.  So I feel a little robbed.  Been there twice before and it was better than this.  That is why I kept the review at a 3.  I will might try again, but there are so many options in the area I'm thinking it might be a while.  I'm wondering if there are better places for better value...."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed it every time. It gets really so be sure to make a reservation or be prepared to wait an hour to be seated. They have a couple of different bars throughout, the place is huge. We had to wait for a table and got drinks at the bar downstairs while we waited. It's a little pricey but it's worth it. The food is very good and the atmosphere is cozy. I ordered the appetizer wings and a side salad as my meal and was completely satisfied. The cocktails are pretty expensive but the beer is much more affordable."}
{"text":"Great spot in Ohio City! We met up with a handful of friends to grab some drinks. The staff was very attentive and the beers were tasty! I always love trying new craft brews in all of the cities we visit and I think Market Garden is definitely doing something right! There were flavors for all taste buds, which I really appreciate! Great, casual spot for catching up, watch a game and grab some grub. It looks like it can get pretty busy as the night goes on so I definitely recommend getting there early if you have a bigger group. Definitely worth checking out, try the flight if you don't know what to order!"}
{"text":"Good beers, a little crowded, but always a fun night.   The building itself and the setup is super cool. With the outdoor area, back rooms, and basement there is plenty to explore. The large bar areas help too.  The beers are just ok and the food is good. I was actually most impressed by the food when we brought a group of 40 folks to them for an event. We had the brisket, pierogies, and salmon and the group loved each offering. They were able to serve us all no problem too. Great job for a group that large!   But lets talk about the Breakfast for Dessert item. It was a savory maple cake with jam, ice cream and candied bacon. Even the LA natives thought it was pretty killer. I highly recommend this sweet and savory dish."}
{"text":"Slid in on for a late Saturday lunch.  Was really glad that I left my \"usual\" spots in the area to hit this place.  I tried the Christmas-y seasonal Ale (forget their name for it).  VERY nice, really rich nose, was crisp & tasty.  We ordered way too much food.  Scotch eggs, a burger and the Brisket sandwich.  It's a mystery to me why more places don't serve Scotch Eggs--they are nearly perfect beer food.  These were really nicely balanced, and I loved the sweet chili sauce alongside the brown mustard.  The burger my companion ordered got two thumbs up; it rivals Flip Side for best burger in her opinion.  The Brisket was excellent--tender, nicely sauced, great slaw & bread.  That sandwich is worth going back for.  The fries here are excellent--just at the extra-crisp stage, and well-seasoned.  When you're in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I finally actually came to Market Garden for food instead of just drinks and it was some of the most mediocre food.  Consistently overpriced along with every other place on West 25th. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was small and lacked the ingredients of an actual Cuban sandwich. It is probably best to stick with a burger but even they did not look very good.  Still a nice atmosphere for drinks. Just wouldn't return for food."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch wanting a burger and a beer and they executed those needs perfectly! The brisket burger was heavenly, piles and piles of meat! Fries were good as well. I'm kind of a light weight when it comes to beer but had their \"permission\" beer which was a crisp Hef, light and delicious.   The main room is wide open with a wrap around bar. They also have another bar in the back. Outside seating when the weather is nice. The bar was busy that day but the staff was still attentive. I really enjoyed it. Literally right next to the West Side Market."}
{"text":"Stopped on a Sunday afternoon. Ashely was our server on the patio- Very friendly and laid back! had the Summer Porter beer and Shrimp Tacos- YUMMY. Friend had Chicken tacos, I didn't enjoy those as much as the shrimp.   Word for the wise when getting tacos: that green pepper on your plate is a Jalapeno, so don't go shoving the whole thing into your mouth. My friend learned that the hard way.   Outdoor patio is very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Walking in from out of town I was initially impressed with the aesthetic of the brewery! Beautiful patio and rustic wood tables with a great urban feel. Then I talked to the hostess and instead of a friendly greeting she rolled her eyes at me twice. We had a large party (10) and she told us she couldn't accommodate us at all. 3 open tables with reserved signs were not touched for the TWO hours we sat at the bar. We were hungry and thirsty and wanted to spend a lot of money trying someplace new in a new city. We weren't going to sit there and drink water all night. Ended sampling some beers though and enjoyed wahoo wit. Would have like to try more food."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Saturday and had a great experience. The service was perfect and the place had a nice atmosphere. Try the beer flight. I really enjoyed the beat salad."}
{"text":"after being told we would have an hour wait at Great Lakes Brewery, we decided to kill some time here...after all, as Mr. Jeff Spicoli might say, there's certainly nothing wrong with a little barhopping on our time, is there?  I tried a Viking pale ale. fresh, hoppy, sweet, and only 5 dollars! the front bar was packed, so we went to one further back and got our beers immediately. aww yeah! I sampled the radler (beer/lemonade mix) and the IPA from my cousins. both were solid.  atmosphere was...interesting. normally I expect a more laid-back crowd at a brewpub but the guys in the crowd seemed a bit bro-tastic while the chicks were dolled up...meanwhile I roll in with camo shorts and a faded t-shirt showing microbrew beer on it.   there was a huge patio section as well as a lot of seating indoors. Friday night it was crowded but you could move around.  as it turned out, within about 15 minutes we got the call for our table at Great Lakes so we headed back there. I chugged down the rest of the beers two of my cousins had ordered since they thought we'd be waiting longer...ah well.  thoroughly solid joint."}
{"text":"Went to MGB for a beer and a bite this afternoon while waiting for a Great Lakes Brewery tour. The restaurant was beautiful both inside and outside, and the beer selection was decent. Between my friends and me, we tried a flight of 4 beers, some cider, and and one of the beer cocktails. We also had a spinach salad and some fish tacos. The beer was okay...not bad but not the best craft beer in my opinion. My spinach salad was nothing special, but alas, it serves me right for ordering a salad. My friends' fish tacos looked good, but I think they were just okay as well. Overall, this was a nice place for groups to get together because of the outdoor seating, but I would probably try some of the other brewpubs in the neighborhood before coming back."}
{"text":"I feel like Market Garden is a welcome addition to the Cleveland Food Scene.  Yes, it's loud. Yes, it's packed. Yes, the beer is different from some of the other places in the area. (That's because it's freshly made.) This continuation of an attention to quality and excellence is exactly why Cleveland is getting serious attention as a food destination.    Don't expect this to be your typical sit-down dining experience.  I've read a lot of reviews that approach this like it's any other restaurant. This is a beer garden. It's meant to be a social experience. It's lively and changes depending on who else is there. The menu reflects this beautifully. Portions that are big enough to share, some great choices for finger foods, and of course, the beer. The beer is incredibly well done and is flavorful, crisp, and fresh. The burgers are also a favorite, but a bit of a commitment at 1/2 pounds.  Come hungry, (and thirsty!)   4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had A great lunch here,  Service was great!!!   Big fan of the chili"}
{"text":"We went out to brunch for a post-halloween refueling adventure. I have been to Market Garden before and they have always been packed - usually on a Saturday night or during happy hour - and the 30 minute wait for a beer is not the fault of the staff because they are just so busy. For brunch, however, we walked in and go seated right away. Fantastic.  Our waitress was prompt and took our orders for our drinks (waters, coffee, and bloody mary's.) We were able to browse the menus and didn't feel rushed at all. She returned with the refreshments and my friend wanted to order the Powdered Donut Holes and the waitress apologized and said they had been out of those all morning. No problem. They had only been open for an hour, but thats fine. But after she informed us that what we had wanted was out, she WALKED AWAY. She did not ask if we wanted anything else, she did not make a suggestion. She just left.  We finished our bloody mary's and she returned to take our order: Poutine, smothered and covered, and a breakfast burrito. Someone from the kitchen tried to give us the wrong order. While we were waiting we saw some other guests get a mimosa tasting flight... that looked absolutely beautiful. Eventually the food came out and the poutine was quartered potatoes with some ambiguous cheese/hollandaise with bacon crumbled in it. The smothered and covered  was quartered potatoes with some ambiguous cheese/hollandaise with bacon crumbled in it with an egg on top (PS: when I broke into the egg beautiful yolk came cascading down my potatoes... along with some clear, uncooked eggwhite slime. I didn't complain because I feel like it wouldn't have made a difference to the apathetic staff) and then finally the breakfast burrito, which was, you guessed it... quartered potatoes, ambiguous cheese/hollandaise with bacon crumbled in it, wrapped in a tortilla.  We ate. Paid. And left. No water refills. No coffee refills. Staff kind of sucked.  We were in a group, and my bill for two people was $75. We each had two bloody mary's, a cup of coffee (no refill), one order of Scotch Eggs (the highlight of the brunch) and two bowls of potatoes.  For the food to be lack-luster is fine. I've been burned by trendy restaurants before.   The service was terrible... but then again, the service is always terrible. If I wanted to be diplomatic I would say its because they were busy and understaffed. Every other time I've been here they have been busy and understaffed. However... this time half the tables were empty.  Would I eat here again? Never. Would I drink here? Maybe.  But it will probably be a long while the next time I do either."}
{"text":"Whoever put those chorizo cheddar pierogies on the menu is sent from God. Go get them. Now."}
{"text":"This is honestly as solid as they come. Some of the beers are quite good, but the consistency is in the food. Almost everything on the menu is good, and fairly priced. The fried chicken is always excellent. The tacos aren't good value, but they're tasty. Can get busy on weekends though, and the seated spaces aren't great."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow, we waited for 1:30 to see our food while the waiter was lousy. After we got our food it was disappointing. Not very kid friendly it is your typical bar but with some food added. Would not recommend with eating with more that 7 people and with anybody who can't drink."}
{"text":"It is rare for me to go to a brewery and like and/ or not dislike most of the beer. That was the case with the brew at Market Garden. Most of the beer I tried in their awesome sampler was not bad to quite good (although nothing was necessarily stellar) The service was attentive and helpful. The burger was good (over cooked to the temperature ordered but still juicy)  The duck sliders were deliciously unctuous."}
{"text":"Bad beer. Okay food. Attracts a lot of the bro crowd at all times of the day which is kind of annoying if you wish to go here for some reason. Expect to receive horrible service if you have the audacity to sit at the bar and are not a hipster or bro or a model."}
{"text":"It's really a shame, this is the second time here in a year. The first time they warned us it would take 45 minutes to get our food so we left and went elsewhere. This time they did not warn us.    Came for lunch on Memorial Day and ended up waiting 45 minutes for tacos and a burger that came out cold.  We asked for our lunch at about 30 minutes and of course we heard the kitchen is slammed excuse. Really? Please be more creative when explaining slow service. This is not your first Monday Holiday being open.   The worst part of this story is no attempt at any reconciliation or empathy from the waiter. A comment about making sure the kitchen gets it fixed then a full priced bill.  No manager, no interest, no tip."}
{"text":"Been here several times to grab a Market Garden beer and I have never been disappointed. The beer is great and there are plenty of options for everyone's taste. I only recently realized how HUGE this place was. There is a beautiful front room with a full bar area and another large area with another bar in the back. I haven't tried any of the food options here but they all looked good."}
{"text":"I've come here for a party in the basement and as a walk-in. It's pretty good considering it looks like a typical college bar. If you have an appreciation for good brews and happen to be hungry and don't want any frills, I wouldn't hesitate to pay the Market Garden a visit."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch Saturday, they were supper nice and sat us near a tv so we could watch football.  We order the pretzel which was very good, and lighter than must pretzels which I really liked.  For our meals I got the veggie burger which had great flavor but the burger itself feel apart.  It's a shame because it was so good.  I still ate it with a fork.  The fries weren't very warm and were dry, I would get a salad next time as a side. My husband got the peach pizza.  He really liked it and it was pretty big.  We could of shared the pizza if we wanted.  The beer selection was great too!!    My review would be a 4.5 because of veggie burger falling apart in the first bite and the fries weren't great.  Our waiter was great too."}
{"text":"Came here in my first week of Cleveland, and I was left with a good impression. The atmosphere is trendy casual cool. At this moment, Market Garden serves primarily as an occasional watering hole for my compadres. As far as the beer is concerned, I haven't been disappointed. They have a really good lager, which is hard to find these days due to the over abundance of enthusiasm for ales in Cleveland (tangent).  My wife and I came here for breakfast one morning and I would say it's good enough for a revisit at some point. I had the breakfast burrito, which was not bad, but I admit I may be biased coming from SoCal. That issue aside, there are a lot of other good breakfast places in Cleveland, so no need to spend all your mornings here when you can come back later that night and drink craft beer.       It can get pretty loud here, on a weekend night, so if your looking for a quite evening of yelling sweet nothings in your lover's ear, then this may be the spot for you."}
{"text":"Hmmm...  Sad really...I REALLY wanted to light this place up with an awesome review... Can't... Went there during lunch for  two reasons but the most important thing was cost v quality... At $11.00 for a burger that was just okay doesn't really resonate with me. My lunch mates were of the same mind set that the entrees were certainly lackluster... Bright side--Our server had the whole patio to run but did a super job!! We won't be back...Just too many other places to go that are SO much better... Crap...  Oh...The manager blew a multithousand dollar deal..."}
{"text":"Valet parking is worth one star. The smoked pork tacos were outstanding. Black bean tacos were good. Since they didn't have Guinness I tried another dark beer and it wasn't bad. The pretzel was fresh and worth having. The only down side was  the noise. Next time we go we will just go for drinks and snacks not conversation."}
{"text":"We are never disappointed at Market Garden Brewery. Had a taste for a burger and the Ohio Beef Burger and the Brisket Burger were perfect. This is a thumbs up place to go."}
{"text":"Look for me outside on the beautiful patio - with a Mason Jar full of beer.  Yes, I said you can order beer in Mason Jars.  What fun!   They are still getting into their groove, and don't have a working phone for reservations (call Bier Market for help, and they will take care of you) ... but super nice staff, good food, beautiful decor, great location - I'm in!"}
{"text":"Delicious grub, but you are going to a brewery for the BEER. I had the \"Fuggin\" IPA and Festivus holiday ale. Both were fantastic. The IPA is hoppy, but just hoppy enough. The balanced flavor will satiate the thirst of India pale ale diehards whilst not scaring away those who merely want to wet their whistle. Festivus is great. I'd take it over the GLBC Christmas ale- and that should say a lot! The first whiff stokes your nostrils with the sweet smells of the season and each gulp warms your gut to the last sip. I'm no longer a Clevelander, but this place will have me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"i want to love all restaurants. i do. i always have an open mind and enter hopeful... we started with the scotch eggs. nothing not to like there. not amazing but solid. i ordered the chicken tacos and would have really appreciated a soft corn tortilla option. is that so much to ask? they were fine. simple. very spicy. my guy got the fried chicken. WHY USE BREAST MEAT WHEN THIGHS EXIST IN THE UNIVERSE? good crunchy coating but overly salted and meat was dry. because it's breast meat. c'mon guys... the kale, potato, bacon part of this dish was really damn good though... even exceptional. we'd go back. but just to give it another chance. it has potential, the chef just needs to try a little harder. or something..."}
{"text":"The place has an awesome set up. The food was pretty good. The beer cheese soup had a strong beer taste, but was good. The hostess had no personality and maybe said two words to us. Our waitress want too talkative either. She took our order and that was about all of the interaction we had."}
{"text":"We stopped in after being in their restaurant enjoying a few beers.   The Beer Cheese soup is awesome.   We got the coffee Porter at the store (they didn't have it in the restaurant)...it is Fabulous.   Great beer tours.   The facility is amazing.   The staff is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 4 stars but because our waitress was so frigging cute I'm giving them 5! Went last Sunday after Taste of Tremont. Patio was pretty full considering some of the other restaurants on 25th weren't as lively. Was very happy to be greeted instantly so myself and my parents could be seated with no standing around and looking aimlessly for someone to come and see us. I hate not being acknowledge.  just a terrible way to start any dining experience. Very nice menu, large enough selection of beers although I had a taste for Chimay which they didn't have. No biggie. My step father and I both opted for the pulled pork..... delicious. I have no clue why it was so good but I'm thinking it had something to do with the pickles or greens on the sandwich. My mother went with some sort of taco which were also very good. Not a clue what was on it but I will be trying to order those next time I go back. Blah blahh blahhhhhhh everything was spot on, service was outstanding from start to finish. If you don't like good food or good beer don't go here. If you don't like big brown eyed women with cute boy cut hair don't go here either. I still am trying to get over the fact of how beautiful this server was. WOW!!! OK so there was one bad thing which I dislike about most places... The bathroom! Yes they were clean and everything but I just really hate using blow dryers to dry my hands. I want PAPER TOWELS!! That is all. Just go here! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I appreciate the natural night throughout the place. While it's next to Townhall, it's a solid alternative to the super loud and packed bar vibe that TH offers. The Hellamango IPA is always a good choice. Also tried the confit wings and they were very good. The chicken falls off the bone so you'll more than likely eat with a fork at some point."}
{"text":"I like MGB. The t-shirt I am wearing in my Yelp picture is from there. I've been in the basement for a sausage making workshop, I've had drinks at the bar with dates, I've enjoyed their food with friends on several occasions, and they usually have this pumpkin food and beer event in October that I like to check out, all around it's a decent place and I would go here over some of the pretentious/hipster or dingy/whole-in-the-wall places on W 25th (you know who I'm talking about...).   Just a tip, during the day MGB is great for food and good service, at night it's more like a packed loud bar (they turn the music up at 9pm) so better then for just drinks and loud socializing."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on their beers. I'm not sure if I caught them on an off day or I'm really just that spoiled by good beer, but what I had here was terrible. I tried a taste of the Kolsh, Old school Lager, Wit, and Hefeweizen. Based on appearance, these beers should not all look the same, nor should they look like cloudy watered down light beer.   In terms of taste, I couldn't tell the difference between the wit and hefeweizen, and neither of them had any citrus or spice characteristics. The lager tasted like water with a bit of flavoring, and the kolsh was just unpleasant.  Again, I'm hoping I just caught them on a bad brew day."}
{"text":"My overall rating for MGB rates four stars, but there were five-star moments during the visit.  Our party of seven arrived a little early for our reservation, and were seated promptly.  We started out by ordering two beer samplers.  Although I am not a fan of some beer styles, they were all quality beers.  I stuck with the Scotch Ale for most of the night, which was very enjoyable.  We also ordered the tortilla chips w/salsa and guacamole to soak up the beer - not bad.  For apps, we shared the following:  - chorizo cheddar pierogies (okay, pretty mild)  - mussels (only had one, but the sauce was tasty)  - beef cheek sliders (outstanding, highly recommended)  - pomme poutine (thank you sir, may I have another)  - market garden meat board (only tried a couple items here, but they put a lot of effort into creating quality meats)  For the main course, I shared dishes with another in my party.  The fried chicken was a little fatty, but the batter was amazing.  I also am not a fan of grits in general, but it perfectly complimented the heat from the sriracha honey sauce.  Also tried the red chili chicken tacos, which were as spicy as advertised.  Both were very good, overall.  Our server was efficient, and when my wife had an issue with her veggie sandwich (something tasted a little off), she offered to either take it off and/or replace with another item.  My wife went for the Market Garden Burger, which was outstanding (I had to take a bite).  She claims it is the best burger she has ever had at a restaurant.  The West 25th area is really coming into its own, and Market Garden Brewery is certainly a destination eatery.  Everyone in our party was thoroughly impressed, and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Beer and food is very good!  Service is excellent!  Vegetarian options available.  Growlers available. They use produce from the market. Good stuff."}
{"text":"The brews are great.  The food has taken a serious downturn.  Sam - replace the kitchen!  Everything tonight was bland at best.  The Smoked Chicken tacos we're not smoked at all and the chicken was grey in color and tasted terrible.  We sent it back.  The Fried Chicken Breast sandwich was unexceptional.   Basically fried chicken with absolutely no flavor.  Who is cooking back there?  The replacement dish for the tacos was the Farmers Mac and Cheese.  Good idea, lacking execution. Again, low on the flavor meter.  There is just no finesse coming from the kitchen.   Flavor profiles are completely absent.  We need something good to eat with the great beer coming from the brewery.   Eat somewhere else and then enjoy the beers here."}
{"text":"6 pm Sunday and everyplace that is supposed to have the best mac and cheese in Cleveland is closed. So I'm already grumpy, but trying not to be. I'm on West 25th Street and walking past Market Garden, I've never been, so I decided to try it out. Should have left immediately when the volume level and genre of the music became apparent. I later found out the restaurant was tuned to theBlink 182 station. No table available, so I sat at the bar. Usually, I don't mind, but just as I was being served a group of drunks sat next to me and began singing along with the terrible music, loudly.   Bowl of beer cheese soup is served in a bowl but could have been served in a shot glass.   It was definitely flavored heavily on the beer side. It was under-seasoned and had a weird mixture of textures. The crouton was inedible. The beet salad was priced like an entree (especially since it had no protein component) but was sized like a side. The arugula salad part was tasty, and well dressed. The beets and carrots were over cooked and mushy. The iced tea was good and reasonably priced with free refills. If the soup were good and the portions were better, I would have no problem with the $16 price tag ($17.28 with tax) service was reasonable and deserved the 20%+ gratuity.   My overall impression is negative. I don't go to places like this on Friday or Saturday because I don't want my senses assaulted. But this is the ambiance they offer at 6pm on Sunday? Food that is over priced for the portions and that simply wasn't pleasant to eat. I shan't return. Luckily Mitchell's is just up the street."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, the beer selection was great, the sandwhiches were really good.  But the reason to go back to this place again and again are the scotch eggs.  They list it as an appetizer but it could easily be a meal with a nice salad and a cold beer.  The flavor of the sausage was great, the egg was not chewy or over cooked.  I would go back today for lunch if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Long wait even though there were open tables, 30 minutes to get our food, lame menu and overpriced.   Ordered $10 chicken fingers off the kids menu for our son, crazy expensive for a kids meal and the chicken had all kinds of spices on them.  I liked them but obviously the person who came up with the recipe doesn't have kids...A must skip experience unless you are a bearded, flannel shirt, man bun type of guy"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I only ate here once.  The food was pretty good, but it was nothing to write home about.  I do like their beers a lot.  They always have a good variety on tap.  The beer garden is the place to be in the summer.  It's very unique, nice, and a spacious part of the bar."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland on business recently and wanted to check out Ohio City.  I decided to eat at Market Garden and wound up pretty disappointed.  I'm glad it was on my expense account.  The place looks nice, hostess was plenty friendly.  Waitress was friendly enough and my beer came without much wait.  I had a Saison that was serviceable - close enough to style and no off-flavors, but pretty much a shot down the middle.  Fair enough.  My dinner took longer than expected to arrive, especially on a slow night.  Unfortunately, it was also essentially inedible.  The skirt steak tacos arrived looking pretty okay, but when I bit in, I discovered they were cold.  Not something-less-than-hot; cold.  On top was a massive scoop of \"chimichurri\", which looked more like frozen spinach (also cold) and tasted like white vinegar.  The side of beans amounted to roughly a tablespoon sized helping of pinto beans covered in what I guess is chef boyardee tomato sauce.  The beans were the best part.  I waited a good while for the waitress to return, probably at least 20 minutes and asked if the tacos were supposed to be cold and crazy acidic.  I was told that they were.  Whether or not that's the intention, my opinion is that the food was pretty bad.  I'd go back to meet a friend for a beer, but I wouldn't eat here again.  Especially with what seems to be a plethora of options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sunday April 30, 1:00pm-3:00pm -- What started out as a challenging 1-star experience **due to the hosts** turned out to be a super fun Sunday funday 4-star experience with our Denver volleyball team post-tournament weekend. After a chat with the manager Zack (Zach?), our experience went from awful to awesome on the patio... in the shade with great beers, food, service -- the complete package! Good times!"}
{"text":"A restaurant that actually warrants the price they charge for their food. Everything we had was great. Plus the atmosphere is so cool. I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the pierogi dinner. Everything was more than expected and more than the rest of the places in the area. They deserve accolades for going above and beyond. Kudos and thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to hang out with friends. I have been many times and sometimes it is hard to get a place to sit... So as long as you are fine with standing this place is great! During the nice weather the back patio is great! I have never had the opportunity to eat here but I hear great things about the food."}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers,  Should you find yourself in cleveland, ohio head on over to the guys at W. 25. I don't care if you're a beer head, or not they have something for you. The place is amazing. It's big, the staff is friendly, quick and they all know alot about the beer. It's way larger than what you think and good grief, COLUMBUS, give me their patio. in fact, build me one in Clintonville and I'll be happy. I don't buy t-shirts from restaurants. We bought two. (State of ohio image with BEER in the middle) Kind of hipsters you can tolerate: the ones that dress the way they want without being dicks. I made conversation with randoms watchin basketball and we talked about why we chose the beer we had. Order the meat and cheese plate. fresh and local. DO IT. Cluster Fuggle. mmmm. heaven.   If i write anymore it'll turn into beer porn. go.  your friend in Beer,  Kelli"}
{"text":"Stopped in last Friday while apartment hunting, had a tasty burger and IPA... just reinforced why we would like to find a home close to the area."}
{"text":"I don't dig beer but the pork tacos with mango salsa were really good.  A friend of mine and I went early on a Saturday...just as they opened at 11:00.  Service was prompt but the place filled up very fast.  I had a bourbon drink which was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Second time here with a group of 4 on a warm Friday night around 9pm. Beer and food were great like last time. Very cool room design and ambiance. But there was a much bigger crowd this time. It gave me a better feel for what I imagine are the regulars here on the weekend. Not quite my cup of tea. I am not dropping my rating of the restaurant because it is great. But unless you like a little more of a meat market for young testosterone filled preppy dudes, you might want to stop in earlier. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the bald guy with the beard who works behind the bar. He made me feel a little uncomfortable with his very aggressive attitude and his pushing the wait staff out of his way constantly."}
{"text":"Five star salad for cleveland!!!  Market greens with rock shrimp and ranch/goat cheese with rainbow radishes....best salad i have had in months.  Thats saying something since i travel every week ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night for a work thing.  We were seated on the patio which I really liked. Lots of seating, a couple tvs and a separate area for smokers which I really appreciated! I ordered the Peaches & Brie flatbread and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!! What really stunk was our server. She asked for my drink order, I responded, then she didn't come back for 10-15 minutes. When she did come back she asked me: \"are you ready?\". I said: \"ready for what? I'm still waiting for my beer\".  She didn't apologize, just asked me what I wanted as if our previous conversation never occurred. Later in the evening she asked if I wanted another beer, which I replied that I did while also pointing it out again on the menu in case she forgot what I ordered. The beer NEVER came. Again, it was as though our conversations never happened. Today at work I mentioned this to a coworker who said that while the food is good at Market Garden, she has consistently received poor service.  So...I would probably go back for the patio ambience and another crack at the flatbread, but if my service sucked again I'll keep my tip money in my purse."}
{"text":"I do love Market Garden. I love their drinks selection, the spaciness of the bar, and the decor & atmosphere of the place.   Drinks-- they have this drink (don't remember what it's called) that tastes just like Mojitos. Ask the bartender, maybe you'll get lucky and they'll know. But it's sooooo good.  Food-- Overall, i'm pleased with market garden brewery food! Specially their shrimp tacos!!!!!!!   Patio-- LOVE THE PATIO! sometimes I come out to the patio even during winter thanks to their heat lamps. Thanks for bringing summer to a winter Cleveland, market garden!  I definitely gotta say I do love Market Garden more than Bier Mrkt."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, a little after 8. Came with friends. We parked at the local Giant Eagle. Wasn't too crowded. Seated immediately in their bottom floor section. Vegetarian friendly. Waitress was prompt, not pushy & happy to give recommendations. I ordered Pomme Poutine w/o the gravy. Huge platter, enough to share with friends. Very tasty & pretty filling. I also ordered the Roasted Eggplant Sandwich. It tasted a bit dry, so I asked for some dressing. My friends ordered the Beet Salad, Soup of The Day, & split the  Chorizo Cheddar Pierogies (very good). Both got Market Garden Beef Burgers with an egg on top as entrees. A friend ordered the Market Centennial per waitress's recommendation & enjoyed. I wasn't wowed but it's good food, calm atmosphere, friendly service."}
{"text":"Breakdown of rating as follows:  ambiance = 4 stars. Fun, good music, multiple bars to choose from service (sat at the bar) = 4 stars, maybe even 5 beers (sampled a couple flights) = 3 stars, decent but nothing special food = 1 star. The pretzel, if you can even call it that, was actually OFFENSIVE. It was a cold lump of bread (more like a roll than a pretzel) served next to a cold lump of tasteless ricotta (the mustard was ok though)...for $7. We thought something went wrong with our plate until the person next to us got the pretzel and it looked exactly the same. Come on guys!! How hard is it to serve a half decent tasting pretzel??? The other food items we ordered were average.   Bottom line: fun place to hang out with friends, but go elsewhere if you want good beer and food"}
{"text":"The beer was pretty good, but $6 for a 12oz. \"Pint\" was a bit of a rip. Loud music and dark lighting, with a sort of a dingy vibe didn't help. Checked out the menu, also felt a bit pricey for what it was. We won't be back, too many other choices."}
{"text":"In Ohio city yesterday walking around hitting breweries. Walked in to MG and was a bit put off by the hostess who said nothing when we walked in, just stared at us. I asked her if we could sit anywhere, there were multiple open tables. We were told there was a bit of a wait. Totally understandable, but she just had an attitude. We waited quite sometime, empty tables....then we went and sat at the bar when a spot opened up. Bartender was awesome, I think his name was Evan, Hawaiian shirt. He gave us great friendly service. We got appetizers, pretzel and beer cheddar soup. It was amazing. Had a great time once we were out of the hostess realm."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, every time I come here I am annoyed by something.  Their house brewed beers always seem to have something off- like a strange bite/ after taste or weird smell.  (Annoying) Stopped in after work last week for happy hour and turns out they don't have happy hour specials.  (Annoying) Really?!?!  This is Cleveland- get over yourself- every bar/restaurant has hh specials!  It was disappointing to say the least.   I ordered the pierogi main plate and the brussels sprouts were left off. (Annoying).  The pierogi was good though.  My boyfriend ordered the Mac & cheese and we were both impressed. I won't be going out of my way to come back here for a food /drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped here since we were in town and tried some beers. St. Emeric's (stout on nitro) and the Irishmen's Enforcer (imperial stout) were pretty good. The Friar Power (belgian tripel) wasn't bad, but wasn't great. The Cleveland Illuminator (doppelbock) was by far my least favorite, but I seemed to be in the minority on that one.  Didn't have any food while we were there, so I can't speak to that, but the menu seemed pretty good.  The place was very spacious, and I didn't feel claustrophobic here at all. Service was also very good and very quick."}
{"text":"My first trip to this place was let's say not great.  I didn't care for the beer that was suggested for me, I got yelled at by a bar back for standing in a restricted area, and the scene just didn't seem to fit my mood at the time.  However, we are regulars of the West 25th scene so I figured I would give it another shot. Every time since and there have been many this place has grown on me. The beers I have tried since are all good and the scene has kicked up a notch.  The food does not come highly recommended to me by people's whose opinions I value so I have never tried it, but if you're on a date and need to kick start the interaction and both parties like beer I can say without question get a beer sampler or two.   I really like this place I do have other W25 staples that it will be difficult for this place to unseed but it is good to mix this one in every so often."}
{"text":"Second trip: their IPAs are brilliant, and the tacos divine. My number one stop in Cleveland for evermore."}
{"text":"Our second visit:( The first time visit  we saw waitress twice once when we were seated, second time after 25 minutes waiting for food, she came to table to ask what we ordered. Never apologized,  never refilled drinks or gave us a bill, had to get up and ask hostess! Moderately busy!  Today, we ask to sit outside, in the sun, never brought extra carafe of water. Waited 35 minutes for a hamburger and chicken sandwich. I had to ask about our food, it's coming the answer. Finally got food, she dropped off and said, wanted to make sure we had fresh potaoes, took off, had to get a set of silverware fr hostess station, since ours was to hot to touch. Had to flag down hostess for salt and pepper. Food was overcooked and not worth the cost. Had to flag down waitress for check, another 10 to 15 minutes. Sorry to say last visit to Beet Market Garden! They need to fix the wholes in business!"}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland annually for a conference, WMC Fest. The Market Garden Brewery was a welcome surprise, stumbling upon it a few years back.  Every time I've been here, always sit at the bar. Have had the same bartender / waiter all three years. Great guy. Very informative and friendly. Beer is excellent, and the burgers are tasty. It's exactly what a bar should be.  The only reason I'll give it four stars, instead of five, are the clientele. Every time, it's always something. Some drunk idiot will saunter up, act annoying. The brewery shouldn't be nicked for this, but it's been overly-annoying a couple times. But it'll never dissuade me from coming back."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the beer or food.  My husband said the eggplant sandwich tasted like a dirty armpit.  I didn't think it was that bad.  The pretzel was good.  Wish it came with a beer cheese sauce.  We got a flight of 5 samples for $9.  I think they were 4 oz each.   Liked the atmosphere & music.  Service was decent.  Seated easily at 9:00 on a Fri night. Indoor & outdoor seating option. I didn't want to leave b/c of the atmosphere & music but didn't want another beer from there since none impressed me. I'd give it another chance b/c of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I LOVE the beer garden here...perfect for day drinking and pretzel-dipping."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection great service was amazing.  We were at a  private party downstairs.  Music was awesome too."}
{"text":"Horrible!! I came here for a birthday celebration on Sunday and the experience was horrible. We waited for the food forever and when it came everyones food was served in 25 minute increments. My 90 year old nana got served last when everyone else's food was Ice cold and she ordered an omelet. The omelet was tiny and extremely overpriced. Don't fooled by the food description, the food is subpar and a money pit. The manager came out and addressed the fact that were out of brioche buns after 1 person was served the right bread and the rest were served a one dollar hamburger bun. But the manager did not apologize for the food coming in 25 minute increments and she offered no compensation. Mind you we had reservations! Also beware of the bathrooms completely unsanitary! This place should stick to serving only the late night crowd! I wish this location would House a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Its a seriously amazing. Sam McNulty has really put together a fantastic venue with a gorgeous patio. He did not hold back at all when it came to Market Garden, but don't get me wrong, Bar Cento and Bier Market are great, but nothing like this. The food is stellar, the bartenders although ALWAYS busy ALWAYS find a way to get you drinks or food in a very speedy manner and they serve food til 2 am! This is awesome! I look forward to heading back on a weekly basis as this is my new favorite hot spot."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I think it's finally ready for a review.   Service is great.  I don't know how anyone has encountered bad service there because it's been amazing for me from the start.  The service is great and everyone is friendly even in a packed house.    The atmosphere has its pros and cons.  The place looks great and it's surprisingly big.  The outdoor beer garden is great, if you can actually get a seat.  The beer garden is either covered in reservation markers or too packed to be comfortable.  What drives me up the wall is how the hostesses mark tables all over the restaurant as reserved and then seat people without reservations at these seats.  I've been seated at reserved tables a couple times after walking out on the street.   I'm not sure if they are poor planners or just keeping tables blocked to make it look busy.  Either way I don't like it.  What I hate about the atmosphere is the night crowd.  It does get noisy, but I expect that out of a beer joint.  What I can't deal with are the brahs and the people who look like they got lost on their way to the club.  It's not actually their look that bugs me, it's the mild Jersey Shore attitude that they bring to a brew pub.  A lot of this crowd hasn't even been drinking beers when I'm there.  I wanted to cry when I heard a guy ask for two screwdrivers and a Miller light.  This crowd ruins it for me, but they only seem to come out on weekend evenings.  The beers are good for the styles.  Actually, they are really good for the styles.  They don't have anything unique or inventive, but I expect that will change as they get the brewery running for a longer period.  I don't expect to see a brand new brewery getting creative and inventive right out the gate.  That would be really expensive and it would make it harder to establish a larger customer base when it really needs to gain a foothold.   They probably could have made at least a couple unique beers, but I'll give the beer list a pass since what they have tastes great.   I really like the Scotch Ale and the Black IPA over everything else.  With that said, I think it's a little overpriced.  I'll gladly pay money for a great beer, but the bulk of the beers are more session-style.  I hope this changes when/if they introduce more interesting beers into the mix.  There's no way I'm going to continually pay $6 for a draft session beer.  The food is hit or miss for me.  I'm a huge fan of Bar Cento and I think Chef Nowak did a good job converting his style of cooking to a brew pub-compatible menu.  However, I don't think we're breaking any new ground here.  Don't get me wrong, the food tastes good, the portion sizes are finally right and consistent (I finally get tacos properly filled with the right mix of ingredients).  I was hoping to see a little more creativity, which is severely lacking.  The menu represents a lot of the norm for Cleveland: hanger steaks, mussels, wings, and tuna.  I think they got it right with the sausages (amazing), the cheese boards (a little different from other joints), the tacos (they weren't that great initially but I think they fixed it), and the fried chicken sandwich (it's awesome even though it's messy).  Everything else is just ho hum, and in some cases it's overpriced.  Their margins must be amazing give the prices.  Nothing is unaffordable; it's just too much for what you get.  The menu also seems confused--there's not much of a theme.  I would love to see a bit more rustic American influence out of this joint since that would go well with the beers.  Overall, it's not a bad place, but it could be better.  I think it's off to a good start and I hope to see it grow over the next year, and maybe find a new night crowd.  I'm also looking forward to the day they get a distiller's license.  It'll probably be a while before anything they make is ready to drink, but it would be awesome if a local spot was making kick-ass whiskey."}
{"text":"Market Garden is a great destination for brunch, late night drinks, or anything in between. I hosted a bridal shower here last year and was very happy with the service and catering they provided.   Stopped in recently for brunch on a Sunday morning and enjoyed a breakfast burrito and mimosa. I read that they recently updated the brunch menu so I am excited to visit again and try something new.   Bar carries a nice variety of local beers as well as their own brews. Recommend a beer flight for anyone who has trouble deciding on just beer to try."}
{"text":"I had a poor experience here. Hated my food, the beer cheese soup was nasty. Very gritty and a cheap cheese flavor. The scotch eggs were also not to my liking. Over fried and too crunchy to cut into or eat, ruined the egg flavor. The salsa it came with was blistering hot and I love spicy food but this was crazy. Didn't like my wheat beer, it had that spice note that I don't care for. The waitress had a puss on her face the whole time, we didn't come close to finishing either food item and she didn't ask if it was ok etc or dare take something off the bill. 2 stars basically just for the great music playlist and beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Stopped by after cruising west side market. Weather was nice, windows open good music playing. Progress Pilsner and Chinook Strike were delicious. Chicken and waffle plus beef cheek tacos - really good. Service prompt and friendly. I'll come back"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch with a group of 10. Server was attentive, kind and made the meal more fun.  The mimosa flights and bloody Mary's were a great start! Food was fantastic and everyone raved about the variety of choices.  It was a great time and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food is average, beer is average.  For that area it does not impress.  I would go there again, but there are more options.  It does have a lot of room, and a great patio though.  I would like to pontificate further, but if you are a brewery with food, and the best thing I can say is you got a nice place... well."}
{"text":"I am torn on the rating because I have been here 1/2 a dozen times and have had completely mixed experiences.  For that reason I am going to go with 3 stars over. 4.  I am going to start with service.  It had been hit and miss on all occasions.  I have had great service and I have had mediocre service.  I have sat at the bar, outside and a table (twice each) and have great and mediocre service in all spots; which is a little disappointing.  The beer is great, they have a great selection/something for everyone and that is why we keep and will keep coming back.  We have had food and it has always been good.  I had \"grainy\" beer cheese soup once, but it has been good the other two times, so I will continue to order.  Everything else I have ever gotten has been great.  The outside area is great and they have a fire year around.  The main thing that they need to work on is consistency of service.  If they can nail that down; this place would get at least 4 stars from me. - maybe even 5!"}
{"text":"I've been here for beer many times, but never for a meal. On my recent visit, finally tried the food and I was most certainly A-OK with all that I ate!   Sat out on the patio on a nice, warm June day in the CLE. My love and I shared the roasted beet/arugula salad that had this delicious chipotle goat cheese. Beets? Goat cheese? FOGETTABOUTIT. I'm there!  We also split a fried chicken sandwich, which was topped with a tangly slaw and encased in a lovely eggy bun. The chicken was moist and so crispy, just like a perfect piece of fried chicken should be.   The only downfall was that the fries that came alongside the sandwich were not crispy and very soggy in fact. Sort of disappointing because it seems it's hard to mess up french fries. They kind of tasted like they were leftover.   Service was solid. I would say you should go and give it a try."}
{"text":"After a visit on Saturday the 27th, I felt compelled to update my review.  My girlfriend and I visited for lunch, and noted that the food quality has taken a noticeable nosedive since the spring.  In addition to the previously noted chorizo pierogi that taste like the Dead Sea (which are inexplicably STILL on the menu), we have experienced additional culinary disasters.    My girlfriend ordered an entree salad.  Not only was the dressing mixed-in, but the goat cheese crumbles had all-but-dissolved.  The lettuce was wilted as well.  Later, after sharing our experience with a server at a competing restaurant, we learned that Market Garden places salads under heat lamps until the order goes out to the table.  This is an inexcusable practice.    My short rib burger was prepared well-done, instead of the very pink medium I requested and expected, and the short rib topping was dry.  At no point did our server come by to check up on us and make sure that everything was okay.    This place is clearly in Coast Mode as far as food service is concerned.  Either the chef has a distinct lack of standards in fundamental food preparation, or just plain doesn't care anymore.  The beers are still excellent, but I wouldn't venture beyond those or the pretzels.  For a meal, you're much better off going across the street to Great Lakes Brewing.  I refuse to eat at Market Garden anymore."}
{"text":"You didn't know it, but you saved my girlfriends birthday by your service alone. Food, drinks, and atmosphere won't separate you here, service will. Thanks for always being one better than the rest."}
{"text":"Pork belly sliders were disappointing.  The meat was cut wrong and the flavor was lacking.  They had an amazing butternut squash soup.  But I give it 1 star because there was a price discrepancy I pointed out and they didn't rectify it.  Bad customer service."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give the Market Garden Brewery four stars for beer and negative two stars for the food. Which explains my two star review.  Visit #1: We were excited to try the beer and some appetizers. Both the brown ale and the tart blanche did not disappoint. Very refreshing on a hot summer evening. The appetizers on the other hand were extremely disappointing. Since we were in a brewery, I HAD to order the pretzel and fully expected a golden, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, prefectly salted twist of dough. We were instead presented with what looked like a soft demi baguette. It felt like a soft demi baguette - curious texture for either a baguette OR a pretzel. It tasted neither like a baguette nor like a pretzel - simply like very soft, doughy bread. Curiouser and curiouser. The stone ground mustard that it came with lacked any flavor besides tartness. After musing over this unexpected bump in the evening, we decided to order more beer (the pilsner for me and more brown ale for the husband - again, very good) and the currywurst. I had visions of a fantastic WSM bratwurst, expertly cooked and accompanied with the curry ketchup. Instead, we got a very, very bland and soggy brat covered with a decent curry ketchup. I have had brats cooked many ways - boiled in beer, grilled, smoked, baked, slow cooked but I have never had a soggy brat. I did not know what to do with a soggy brat. Bewildered by the turn of events, we looked for an explanation and decided that the fault must surely lie with our overspiced, ethnic palates. And the fact that we had had a fantastic meal at the Pupuseria La Bendicion just a couple of hours ago MUST have skewed our judgement. So we decided to call it a day and come back for a second visit.  Visit #2: This time, we took three friends with us to ensure fair judgement and to assure us that our palates were not to blame. Again, the beers were fantastic - wheat beer, tart blanche, brown ale, pilsner. The food was distressingly disappointing. The meat 'board' was supposed to include beef jerky, slovenian sausage, house made pickles, house cured honey ham and stout mustard. What we got was a plate containing barely half a piece of Czuchraj beef jerky, three or four thin pieces of smoked slovenian sausage, a few pieces of pickled veggies (the green beans were great, everything else was 'meh'), two spoonfuls of what tasted like dried cherries mixed with a teeny tiny bit of stone ground mustard, what looked like one slice of Oscar Mayer deli meat and two pieces of hard as a rock toast. Hard as a rock...I kid you not. In fact, husband spent the next fifteen minutes staring glumly into his beloved brown ale as he bounced a piece of the bread higher and higher off the plate. The strongest emotion generated by the meat 'board' was a heated argument over whether the Oscar Mayer looking meat was turkey or ham or neither. This was the first time I regretted spending $2.20 (my share of the meat board) on food. Needless to say, we did not stay for dinner.  The MGB is located next to the West Side Market. It is so close to the WSM, that it could be considered part of the WSM. How can any self respecting restaurant located this close to one of the best sources of fresh produce and meat in Cleveland serve such food?? How??   *Appalled and accusing look at the MGB*"}
{"text":"I am blown away by this place's popularity. Service is consistently terrible. The only staff worse than the servers are the bartenders who have twice failed to even greet me when I've sat down at the bar. I got fed up and left. This hasn't even been when they were particularly busy. It's one thing if they'd even acknowledged our presence and told us they'd be with us as soon as they could, but not even that. This most recent visit will be my last, especially since after not being greeted for 15 minutes, I saw one of the bearded bartenders smoking a cigarette by that stupid blackboard they put on their wall outside.  Food is okay. Elevated and trendy bar grub, executed averagely. Beer is fine. Often they bump terrible club music.  Anyway, I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere. Even Townhall which I typically regard as a suburbanite tourist trap owned by mildly evil people."}
{"text":"Mediocre product, and horrific excuse for a kitchen.  Seriously... the food is terrible.  If it weren't for the ambience and the consistently adequate service, this would be 1 star.    I'm sorry to say this, too, because I think the place showed tremendous promise and I unqualifiedly *love* Bar Cento.  They just need to get their house in order (or stop trying to serve food altogether)."}
{"text":"I was in at The Market Garden Brewery last night and I had such a pleasant experience. The food was good and I drank The Cycle Soda, which was delicious. What I liked the most was the staff. Very nice people. What caught my eye the most though was the manager. He was walking around with such a nice smile on his face and I really appreciated the fact that his shirt was tucked in and he had it buttoned all the way. It was so refreshing to see someone dressed so professionally. He looked like such a handsome southern gentleman, like a young Clark Gable. It just made my night."}
{"text":"Five stars for a bad-ass patio. Four stars for a tasty IPA with a funny, but awesome, name - sadly, I can't remember it. Fungle..something-or-rather. (Per a friend's help after reading my review - the name is Clusterfuggle... we think!)  It's been awhile since I'd visited my former stomping grounds. I used to frequent W. 25th a lot since I lived in Ohio City so it was a nice surprise to see a new place to imbibe and indulge. On my trip to visit the amazing Cara L to help out with a party, I was pretty happy we chose here as our after-hours destination.  I'll start with ambiance because that was my favorite. Never have I loved a patio quite like this. It's a shame Clevelanders will only be able to enjoy it four months of the year. And for the record, the tables are real wood, not faux wood, like I tried to argue to my peers.  The house-brewed beers are pretty tasty as well! I got the pleasure of trying a few and the funny-named IPA (Clusterfuggle!) and blonde ale were my favorite. And really, who doesn't love drinking beer from a mason jar!!? If you can get yours in one - it's worth it.  This is in part due to the really slow service. The mason jars give you a few extra ounces so you don't need to reorder as quickly. You really need to step up your game here, MGB. It took us at least 10min to order drinks or be acknowledged by our server, and another 10 to receive them. Thankfully the food came out a little faster.  Ah the food. My order was OK. The veggie burger tastes like black beans and nothing else, and the curry brat appetizer was OK but tasted exactly like bratwurst sprinkled with curry powder. Not awful, and a nice change of pace as a starter, just only OK. But my friend's pork tacos - they were pretty amazing. Didn't really expect that.  Everything all balanced out to make my evening there pretty awesome. When I head back up to the CLE soon to grab my beloved case of Christmas Ale, I plan to stop back in to MGB to see how they've matured... and of course to drink more beer and pray the for good weather to enjoy the patio before the onset of winter."}
{"text":"This is by far the cutest bar I've ever been to. Drinks  Food  and don't get me started on the prime location . However, , I did take issue with the menu's description of the avocado toast. One piece is not \"shareable.\" One piece is a pre-meal for a single human, but not 3. Please take care of this and I'll edit my review to 5 stars. Thx"}
{"text":"Fun, lively place with a younger crowd. Nice, darker modern tavern ambiance. Service was quick, efficient. Was able to do a flight here as well as full pours in pretty decent glassware. Didn't try the food. Prices reasonable for the area, a big value coming from DC and California. My only qualm is that a lot of their beer is low quality and brewing flaw laden. Lots of DMS (creamed corn, cabbage) in many offerings. However, a couple were outstanding for some reason. I was a bit surprised to turn around and see a table of eight attractive young women begin taking body shots off of my friend who was laying down on the table shirtless. So 4-stars?"}
{"text":"We showed up looking for an alternative to Great Lakes Brewing (nothing wrong with GLBC, just looking to change venues) and found Market Garden.  They have a variety of beers and styles to try which can be overwhelming. The good news is that their flights are generous in portion and price, allowing you to have a wide range of tastes.  That said, most of the brews were good but average. I didn't find my new favorite brew here, what they were producing was well done but also nothing special.   The food was also mediocre.  We got a veggie burger and fried chicken sandwich. The veggie burger was OK. The fried chicken sandwich came out burnt the first time. When a new one came out, the same fries were on the plate and cold as ever. They were also oversalted. The sandwich was good, not great.   There's a lot of seating, which can be good for larger groups.  I feel Market Garden is good for one stop to sample the beers or if you're with a large crew, but I wouldn't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Never been to this brewery before and i just wanted to ask a couple questions about their products and i received the snottiest replies from the bartender.. Wasn't impressed and didn't feel welcomed.  Won't recommend and won't come back."}
{"text":"Good beers, nice staff, amazing space (that double sided fireplace was a dream on a blustery January evening)!  It looked like they had lots of different spaces for events or more private gatherings--definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Ordered the beer flight-- enjoyed tasting the varieties. In my unschooled opinion, the American Lager and Brown Lager were the best of the 6 samples. The others were serviceable-- the IPA was an IPA..  I can't say enough good things about the vegan option they had the night we were there-- Cauliflower Steak-- (one of my favorite things). Very filling and delicious... My son had the mustard-buttermilk fried chicken (it was good as well). The beer garden looked great-- on the Thursday evening we were there it was full of good-looking young people... Will go back if I am in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"This place knows how to be a great restaurant, hands down. Where some restaurants are \"good\", Market Garden Brewery simply knows how to execute to put themselves in a league of their own. Walking into this place feels half restaurant half art gallery because of the attention to the crafts of brewing and general aesthetics.  The food is quite good. Our table ordered the Poutine appetizer -- I enjoyed it. My entree was their burger, and it came loaded with all I could want, and an over-easy egg (!?). Quite delicious.  And then there's the beer. Fantastic selection. Their microbrews are tasty (though I can only speak for their stout, but it's fair to extrapolate) and they are well-stocked in other high-quality items. The only way you can go wrong is to not get beer. It *is* a bit of an expensive place, but I can't hold that against them. 5/5 for being a great all-around restaurant/bar that is good for any audience.  Also, try to catch a Science Cafe the second Monday of every month! http://www.case.edu/affil/sigmaxi/"}
{"text":"Market Garden is a solid addition to the west market area, and I'm always happy to see my hometown get another brewery addition.  They have a solid lineup of beers, which hold their own in terms of flavor and drink-ability. I wouldn't call it the best beer I've had, but it's pretty good when great lakes is about 250 feet away from your doorstep.  The food was good, but not stellar for the price. With food and two drinks for two people, we ran up a $50 bill pre-tip.  The inside is beautiful and it was a good place to catch an Indians game."}
{"text":"First visit to Ohio City and not sure where to go to eat,  but we found a winner.   The restaurant is large with numerous high top tables, a few booths and an outside eating area, as well as the bar.   At 2:30 on a Sunday, we got the last high top for 4.  The beer menu is extensive and we all tried something different.   Everyone was happy with their choice of beer.  3 of us got tacos (different kinds) and 1 got a Cuban sandwich with fries.   The Cuban was nothing special, but the tacos were winners.   You get 3 tacos, a side of guacamole and pickled jalapeños.   The flavors were awesome and it was very filling.   Winner, winner!  Server was attentive but not intrusive and helped us with beer selections.  So, 4 beers and 4 lunches for $80.  Will probably return when in the area."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to do lunch here yesterday at around noon.  The place had a decent crowd and the atmosphere was lively.  The interior decor suites my own tastes with dark, dimly lit tables but with just the right amount of natural light coming in from the front.  I ordered a Boss Amber Lager, which was \"smooth and mildly toasty in flavor\" just as the menu promised.  From their brunch menu and upon the advice of my trusted friend, I ordered the beignets, which were the highlight of my meal.  With lightly powdered sugar and warm to the touch, my only slight disappointment was that I didn't have enough raspberry sauce to make it through the entire dish.  Then, my main course was the Yucatan Marinated Pork Tacos, which were solid but not outstanding.  My friend had the fried chicken waffles and he complained that they were slightly overcooked and a bit bland.  He's a friend who has introduced me to a number of dining establishments in the Cleveland area and has traveled extensively across the United States, which makes his judgment a pretty reliable indicator of quality in my view.  Still, since my dining experience was positive overall and this is my review, I chose to give this place four stars.  It's a decent establishment with a nice atmosphere and a pretty good menu.  It isn't my all-time favorite restaurant, but I would come back again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Market Garden Brewery has plenty redeeming qualities and with a few very fixable tweaks, has the potential to be a premiere establishment. It's just not there yet.   First off, the place is absolutely humongous and could accommodate a large crowd very easily. Patio seating in the front along W. 25th, inside, there's two separate bar areas, medieval looking chandeliers provide nice accent lighting, natural surfaces throughout and a very open and airy atmosphere that leads you to the grande patio in the back. The construction and ambiance were certainly well thought out.   The staff there was all very attentive and super friendly. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a smile from the hostess who welcomed me into the pub. Awaiting the arrival of our party, I sat at the bar where the 'tender took the time to introduce me to the menu and inform me of several upcoming events the Brewery will be hosting. Once the rest of the crew arrived, we chose to sit out back in the beer garden where several communal tables with high top seating fill the space. Overhead space heaters with a natural gas connection aide in keeping the outdoor space warm when it cools down. There's also a mammoth sized wood burning fireplace with a waft of wood smoke filling the air.   The view from the patio was probably my favorite thing about Market Garden Brewery. The beer garden runs lengthwise next to the West Side Market and the iconic clock tower looms overhead. I'd imagine during working hours of the market, it'd create quite the ambiance.   As for the beer, I opted to try several versions of their in-house draft brew even though they also offer various bottled micro brews. The ones I tried included the Hop Soup, Fall Porter, Oktoberfest and their seasonal Pumpkin Ale. My favorite was definitely the Pumpkin, a perfect tribute to the fall season.  Our group ordered food of all varieties. I got the pork tacos, while others got the meat and cheese board. Several sandwiches were also consumed. And out of the lot of us, it was pretty much consensus that the food was indeed very average and nothing special at all. To me, I found this particularly disappointing considering their parent restaurant (Bar Cento/Bier Market) that is just across the street has really good food. I'm not sure what happened, but all of the talent must be across the street.  A little more emphasis and improvement on the food would go a long way to making this place really special.   At the end of the night, our server offered to split checks for our convenience. We didn't ask and hate doing that with groups, but she went out of her way to accommodate us. So, if push comes to shove, the intangibles certainly make up for the food. They just need a little more attention in the kitchen and this would be THE place to be on W. 25th. Until then though, it'll just be a once in a while place with a really great patio, awesome service and decent beers. For most, I'm sure that's enough to keep coming back. But in order to elevate to the next level, the food needs work."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the beef burger and my husband had the brisket burger, both were so good!"}
{"text":"I have been a longtime fan of Market Garden Brewery since Citra Max IPA came out, which is the best IPA in my book and I've had my fair share of IPAs.  However, I have never tried their food...that is until now.  Came here on a bustling Saturday night, but did not have any problems getting a table for two.  There were a couple parties here and there which was great for people watching.  I don't know why so many people are complaining about the wait here.  If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night, it's expected, so chill out! If you are a fan of mussels, please order the Mussels Michelada- you'll thank me later.  The broth was so good my boyfriend and I started using our mussel shells to scoop up the broth.  The other standout dish was the Crispy Salmon.  Forget all of the fancy veggies and sauce it came in-which were ok-in all of Ohio I have never tasted a more perfectly cooked piece of salmon with the perfect amount of crisp.  I'm drooling just thinking of it and I don't even eat salmon that often.  The service was just as good which added to the pleasant dining experience. Please don't overlook this establishment when deciding where to go for dinner.   Come here for the food and stay for the beer...or vice versa..."}
{"text":"The servers are friendly and there is a great beer selection. There were 6 of us in total, 3 couples, and when this bills came they were very messed up but our waitress rectified this quickly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently decided to have lunch here for the first time. I got a burger (which I never order when I go out) and fries. It was delectable! He also order a cup of the taco soup, and it was very tasty. We both got the same Amber beer that was a house brew, and it was outstanding. I would absolutely order a growler for my next visit.  Happy to see great places thriving in CLE!"}
{"text":"Great brewery in Downtown Cleveland located next door to the West Side Market.  They make about 10 different beers that are all available on draft.  The restaurant is divided into three areas with a front dining room (with a bar), then a larger back room (with another bar), and then an open-air patio with tables.  The beers were all really good.  We really liked some of their wheat beers (Wahoo Wit and Pearl Street Wheat).  There are some great \"beer cocktails,\" and we tried the blueberry drink made with simple syrup.  Although we didn't have any food, this place seems like it would make for a great weekend spot to watch football games."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have brunch on Labor Day and of course not many places were open. We were looking for more of a waffle kind of place, but ended up here with the suggestion of our friend who lives in Cleveland.   The place itself is beautiful. It has a rustic, yet modern look to it. We decided to sit outside near the street because they have a beautiful patio.   I was definitely not too impressed much in the variety of the menu. They had a decent amount of items, but only a few choices that I was debating. I love the fact that they use local products and are clearly into more \"natural\" foods, but sometimes a boy just wants a regular burger and fries after a night of drinking (because, after all, we couldn't get brunch!).  I ended up ordering the bean tacos for $9. They were decent and definitely put out on a nice spread, though I would have preferred meat in them. They're small, but I was able to fill myself with them and the help of sharing a mac and cheese entree with the table. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. The cheese was thicker yet light, and everything they mixed in and infused it with (kale, for example) made it delicious. Though, $14 for it was a little steep. I also don't think I would be able to eat it alone as an entree. It was amazing, but a whole plate of it to myself would have been too much.   Service was so-so as we waited awhile for our waitress."}
{"text":"Market Garden is so reliable, and I mean that in the best way possible. This place never lets me down. It makes me so happy to have a neighborhood staple that never fails on awesome eats, excellent service, and a chill atmosphere.  To begin, I LOVE their patio. You really can't beat the outdoor fireplace, twinkle lights, and backdrop of the West Side Market. The ample parking in the West 25th lot doesn't hurt, either. It's an agreeable place to meet friends or have a date night. Market Garden is the perfect balance of hip but not overrated, and poppin' but not obnoxious. I love coming here to watch CLE sports, and I always find myself here munching on their excellent tacos and watching the game.  Recently, a few of my sorority sisters and I did a beer testing. We took private tours of the brewery, and had a generous sampling of some of MGB's quality beers. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable, and the selection offered was outstanding. I would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying their both kinds of tacos, the pork and chorizo... both dishes were served with fresh herbs and salsa and whoever is designing these flavors knows their business =)  For beer I had their flagship IPA and I was pleased =) Nothing to rave about but it was tasty, hoppy, and refreshing =)"}
{"text":"Continuing the exploration of Cleveland area breweries, I stopped in at Market Garden Brewery one evening to check out their beer selection and have a flight of Ales.  Parking is somewhat difficult. I found a lot out behind their street, and it was packed on a Tuesday evening! But I did manage to snag the one open parking spot!  Lots of seating indoors and outdoors. No one was on the outside patio when I arrived, it was pretty chilly outside. They did have a fire going in the outside fireplace - but no one was taking advantage of it.  I ordered a flight of four ales - all IPAs!  Citramax IPA (6.7.% ABV) Hellamango IPA (5.4% ABV) Trouble IPA (8.0% ABV) Cluster Fuggle IPA (6.5% ABV)  I enjoyed the first three IPAs - all used various \"hoppy\" hops - where as the Cluster Fuggle is a mix of English and American hops - it was an okay Ale but not as good as the more pronounced citrusy/piney/resiney ales.  Service was very good and the place was fairly busy for a Tuesday evening!"}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good.  A tad over-priced.  11 dollars for French fries and gravy is a bit much.  Beer is solid.  Andy is a great brewer.  Cool looking place.  Since its on 25th you get the inherent douchy crowd a lot.  Not really the beer enthusiast, but more the beer-cocktail type crowd.  CLE and \"Ohio\" shirts everywhere.  Ok, we get it.  Cleveland has turned a corner and your the biggest cheerleader.  Servers are lackluster.  All these new, hip places have people with zero personality but do look the part.  Go to a diner or an old man bar and see someone that been doing it for years.  THATS service.  Not just to afford a night out drinking and an 8-ball, but to survive and pay the bills."}
{"text":"The location is great and the patio looks like it will be a lot of fun when the weather is better. The food was pretty good. Simple recipes, flavors complimented one another well, and fresh ingredients. I had black bean tacos and chicken tacos. Didn't get to try the beer. Heard it's good. Everyone else's food looked delicious. The service was a little slow and the staff were kind of creepy, but overall effective. The server earned a 18% tip."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table at 4:30. At 6:45 we were told by our waitress that there was a 7:00' \"reservation\" for our table. At 7:00 the hostess told us the party of four was here for their table. We spent $200 between the four of us and were basically asked to leave our table. When asked to speak with a manager, she said her hostesses told us when we were seated the table had a 7 pm reservation. This was untrue - and we honestly would have been ok w the heads up. When we told the manager we were never told that, she replied \"I believe my hostesses bc they are honest people.\"  Umm ... Ok. Would we have argued this if we were given a two hour notice? She also told us that \"everyone has to have a good experience - not just us.\"   All in all, waitress and food was good - manager and handle of situation - completely unprofessional. We will never return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for totally overpriced food, SLOOOOOW service and a place that somehow runs out of hamburgers AND wings on a Saturday night, this place is for you.  Went with a larger party (mostly adults, some kids) Saturday night. Got seated downstairs (the 'restaurant' part) promptly and got drinks pretty quickly. The drinks and beer were fine (beer was okay, not great).  The problems were many: Look, I get that large parties will obviously take more time as they try and time the food so it all comes out relatively close together. But when I say slow service, this was SLOW service. The food took at least 45 minutes to come out and most of it was warm.   They have what I would call a non-traditional menu. They try and position standard-fare food as upscale as they make it with different ingredients than traditional bar food. But at the end of the day, it's still bar food. Worse, it's really expensive for what you get. I ordered the ribs. For $21 I got maybe 5 ribs (not even half a rack!??!) that were heavy on the seasoning and very dry. Honestly I've had much better ribs at Texas Roadhouse for $5 less and for a full rack.  Everyone who got the ribs said the same thing: small portion, very dry and over-seasoned and a side that consisted of a small piece of cornbread and a few tablespoons of collard greens.  Several ordered scallops and commented that they were gritty (you could taste the sand) and bland.  Here's the kicker: we had kids there and the menu is very limited already. But they then proceeded to tell us they were OUT OF BURGERS. What?!?!? How the hell can a bar in Cleveland be out of one of the few basic things they have on their menu on a Saturday night? That's just poor management.   So that basically left one choice for the kids: wings. Four of the kids ordered wings. About 25 minutes later the server comes back and says 'we're also out of wings'. Is this an F'ing joke? You ran out the two items on your menu that kids like and probably 2 of the most basic items ANY restaurant should have on hand?  The server worked with the kitchen to pull together some breaded chicken breast that they cut up and made in to 'tenders'. The chicken and breading was literally tasteless, no seasoning in either the chicken or the breading. Needless to say most of the 'tenders' went uneaten.  The best part of the place was that it was near Mitchell's ice cream so when the kids couldn't actually eat real food they went to fill up on ice cream (which is probably what the adults should have done).  After complaining to the manager, he was kind enough to take $100 off of our check which was admirable.   Would definitely not recommend or make any effort to make it back here."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state.  Lived in AK where they live beer and barley wine.  Anyway, Market Garden's barley wine is bitter, no bouquet and just overall unpleasant.  Returned after a sip, they said okay.... And that's it.  Hey, offer me another drink or push me to post crap about you on Yelp... Amateurs.  2 Stars because other people seemed to enjoy their drinks."}
{"text":"Overall: Disappointing burger and sandwich.  Service stopped after 10pm when we had to order everything at the bar, which isn't a great dining experience.  Service: 2 stars.  We arrived around 10pm Friday and were informed that we had to order food from the bar.  I can understand this past midnight, but 10pm is still a time when many people eat dinner on the weekends and it was awkward to have to go to the bar and flag down a bar tender each time we wanted something.  They also forgot the coffee we ordered.    Food: 2 stars.  They were out of brisket, which was disappointing.  The burger was slathered in a weird \"fry sauce\", which ruined the burger.  The Cuban was dry.  The scotch eggs were the best thing we tried.  We didn't order any alcoholic drinks.  Price: 3 stars.  It was $55 3 appetizers, 1 burger, 1 sandwich and 1 soda.   Atmosphere: 3 stars.  The location is great and the patio is nice."}
{"text":"As many others have said, the structure of this place is killer. Awesome basement, great bar areas, and the patio is unlike any other in Ohio City. Great atmosphere and charm.  The service is mediocre. Bartenders should be personable and approachable, and I'm not sure this staff has it quite yet. The beer is good. Great Lakes Brewery is literally 300 feet away.....so the beer is good. Not great, and not Great Lakes. I haven't had the food and from the looks of other reviews, I probably won't.  I'm sure my friends and I will continue to visit this place, especially with summer coming and cool outdoor bar areas being scarce in Cleveland. Its a good spot but its not my first pick for West 25th."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I am from out of town and this place gets 5 stars for service alone! Not only did I have amazing beers and food but they treated me so nicely and gave such great recommendations! Not only did they give me such attentive service, but they also accommodated for my requests to play a certain game on TV and turn on the sound. If I was back in Cleveland, I would 100% come here.  Come for: NFL games MLB games Good food Good beer"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were driving through Cleveland and decided to have lunch here. The place was very busy but we got seated right away ! The atmosphere was very friendly and casual. We started off with the avacado toast which was delicious. My boyfriend had eggs Benedict and he said the meat that came with it was cooked perfectly. I had the Walleye tacos, they were great. Our waitress Mary was friendly and attentive !!"}
{"text":"Tried a flight and the beers were pretty good. In love with the names of the beers, but not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Beautiful facility, especially the outdoor area. Beer is all over the place, poor to good. I'd say to avoid their Trouble (IPA).   There is a big problem with this place. We went last night (Saturday) and they had a live DJ playing music. It was so loud inside and out that we had a hard time talking. The songs chosen were on par with a club. Why is a brewery presenting a club vibe? I will no longer recommend this place for craft beer enthusiasts."}
{"text":"I was able to return here for lunch on my most recent visit home. My second experience was even better than the first. I love the vibe, service, beer, and food here.  First, for a downtown restaurant/brewery the parking is a breeze. There is lot behind the building and a lot across the street near GLB as well. Second, the building is huge so even on a busy afternoon we were able to get a table without a problem. There were even large groups arriving to find tables without a problem.   They are a brewery first so let's start there. The beers are awesome. We started with a beer flight and all four beers were very good. My husband commented that it was the best flight he has had. Usually there are some winners and some losers, but here they were all winners.   The food could trick you into thinking that this is their primary business because it's so amazing. Fortunately, good beer doesn't mean a compromise on the food quality.   Of course I started with the Chorizo Cheddar Pierogies because I enjoyed them so much last time. They lived up to my memory of the deliciousness. I also ordered the Fall Squash Salad which was more of an entrée than a starter because it was a hearty salad. This was a delicious salad with a nice combination of squash, greens, grapes, blue cheese, and vinaigrette.   For lunch I had the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. I expected a fancy restaurant portion, but this was huge. It definitely had the cheesy, salty, meaty flavor that I expected. I like kale, but this didn't seem like it belonged in this dish. It created a weird texture and the dish would be best without it. My husband had the Ohio Beef Burger and loved it. The fries tasted like they were homemade.  I only wish I had been able to find room for dessert. This spot is definitely on my list for spots I must visit when in town. Great spot, great food, great beer, and great for Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Is there a '0 Star' option? Visiting from California. I've loved Ohio up to this point, but I must say, this place was pretty bad. Our waitress was occupied with other waitresses from the get go. She was gossiping, crying & and seemed downright miserable.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and took 2 sips. The 2nd just to confirm how bad it was. Had to return it for a Coke.  The food, not impressed either. I would go on more, but it's no longer worth the time. My history on Yelp has always been positive, but I must say, this was too awful an experience not to let people know about."}
{"text":"i have mixed feelings about this place, i'd really like to give it a 3.5. I haven't had the food, so I can't comment on that. But stay away from the pickle platter!!!! its sort of an assortment of ass flavored vegetables. the beer is honestly mediocre. it's good enough, but it's certainly not great. the IPA was pretty weak and lacking in flavor. the first time i went our service (at the table) was great. however, the second time i went, the bartender was pretty rude to me. aside from his bad attitude, i bought 4 drinks and asked for one water, which was greatly needed. he brought the drinks, took my money (and tip) and then proceeded to take over 10 minutes ( i asked a second time) to bring me  water, serving other people, and didn't bring it until some nice stranger said something. That was a huge turn-off to me. This place earns major points as far as size and patios go!! it also has a great ambiance and is a really fun environment. It's definitely a fun place to be at night, and I'll still go here, it just has some areas to improve on."}
{"text":"Theres probably a good reason why everything I ordered here had chorizo in it..the chorizo cheddar pierogies and the bbq pork with chorizo sandwich...and that reason is because chorizo is amazing!! Both those menu items were so delicious, the chorizo cheddar pierogies..you get 3 for $8, and they are pretty good sized.  The appetizer was eaten so quickly by our table, it was a good thing we had 2 of them.  We practically licked the sauce off the plate!  The pork sandwich was also so juicy and flavorful, helped by the plentiful chorizo stuffed in it as well as an excellent mild and not overpowering bbq flavor so you could really taste the pork and chorizo combination.  Its a decent sized sandwich with lots of meat!   Their beer selection here is good, with plenty of home brewed options and non-MGB options to satisfy any beer drinker.  Unfortunately, there is no happy hour specials here."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good selection of beer, and their choice in music was top notch. Not many complaints overall."}
{"text":"I decided to give Market Garden another try and I was not disappointed. Service was much better upon this visit and the food was served as it should be. I would recommend checking MGB out during non peak hours. Also, awesome ginger beer(na)."}
{"text":"C'mon now. This place is great! If you like great beer and good pub food this place is tough to beat. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about, this is NOT Lola or Crop which should be held to a higher standard. The service has ALWAYS been friendly and fast ta'boot!  Ok. So I've had the duck sliders (great), some sort of spicy tortilla soup special (tasty and better than any other pub anywhere) as well as the pork tacos which went down so fast I don't even remember them but must be good right? (But not great since not memorable).   Ok. Beers? Yes. Yes. Yes. I've had the Cluster Fuggle and the Viking Pale Ale.  Both are solid but the ClusterF is GREAT! I cannot wait to try the Market Centennial, but that will have to wait until I have another driver to help me home. I also had their Christmas brew. Solid. So much better than the Christmas Ale from the place across the street that's uber- famous.   5-stars. I love it. It's a bar. It's a pub. They serve pub grub that's GREAT to go along with their superior beers. I just hope they start bottling which will make me have to make some hard decisions between Market Garden and Fat Heads. To those of you knocking this place. I don't get it. Good beer, good food, friendly and fast service and a great atmosphere with fireplaceS. Capital \"S\", fireplaceS. C'mon now."}
{"text":"Omg am I really popping market gardens cherry? My new Ohio city hangout!"}
{"text":"Good beer, food is hit or miss. Get the poutine but tell them to hold the salt on the fries. Otherwise it's pretty overwhelming. Shrimp tacos are also great. Burger is pretty underwhelming. Brunch is fun. Mostly, it's better than OK! And that's a great thing. Stick to what's good and you'll always be glad you went."}
{"text":"A bro-bar that makes a solid Chicken Sandwich. They went way too light on the toppings and sauce for my liking (I would order extra sauce on the side). Really excellent selection of beer here."}
{"text":"If I could give a no star I would.  Being a local Clevelander I should of known not to even walk into this place for dinner let alone a drink .  We ordered two summer cocktails from their menu which were watered down.  The appetizer was a pound of mussels it was the case of quantity over quality.  The beef tacos were reminiscent to dried beef jerky with guacamole and sour creme to hide the poorly prepared meat.  The best was the arugula salad , beet and radish salad.  There were two poorly prepared red beets with two small sliced radishes.  The menu boasted feta with a rhubarb infused dressing.  There was no feta and seems that they made a dressing out of mayo and milk.  It was like ingesting a spoonful of Crisco.   The salmon which I got on the side was undercooked.  Needless to say I only ate about 4-5 bites.  The service was ok.  Patio was a little bit dirty.  25th street hasn't changed they feed the tourists/ and suburbanites who want to brag to the other moms at the soccer games that they were on 25th.   Touch is the better establishment.  I would stay in Tremont or 6th street if you want a nice dining experience .  Also Luxe is excellent in Gordon Square."}
{"text":"The environment, beer selection, and the people at this place are amazing. I'll let the food speak for its self."}
{"text":"I only had beers, but I have nothing negative to say. As someone who enjoys trying new craft beers, it was a fun experience. I appreciate when the staff can say a lot about the product, and my experience indicated that. The atmosphere was very cool. Definitely would be a great place to hang out and meet up with friends; I would definitely go back and choose this bar over others I visited. I even met a couple cool people, so it is nice to be in a friendly environment when you are visiting from out of town. I definitely recommend this bar if you are a fan of beers."}
{"text":"Now I didn't eat here except the popcorn (I make better bbq popcorn so I was less than impressed), but the beer here was really good, especially for a hoppy beer lover like myself.  The IPA was super tasty as was the pale ale.  Actually, I think I got the sampler so I might have tried every beer except the wheat beer (can't stand most wheat beers).  I even liked that stout and I'm not usually a fan.  I'm like a one note beer person, I know it's lame, but I likes what I likes and I've tried to get into other type of beers, but IPAs and APAs are what I dig the most.    I sat outside in the beer garden and it was super nice.  They even started a fire (albeit badly) which I dug, and I was assuming in colder months they'd have the heat lamps.  I would definitely try the food there next time (it was my 1st night out in Ohio city so far), although their menu seemed a little lacking in veggie options, but I'm sure I can figure something out (they also seemed like a place that would update their menu regularly, but obviously I don't really know)."}
{"text":"We loved it here! It's beautiful and modernly decorated with retro charm. Sweet bike rack in the front and the patio is spacious and sunny. We had great service, our waitress was knowledgeable, friendly and had great recommendations. The menu is fun to look at, the beers all have creative descriptions, and my bf was happy with his picks. The BBQ popcorn is a great, tasty snack! They had a small wine list, but it was good. I ordered a pretty plain salad, but the lettuce was super fresh and crisp. BF had the chicken tacos, and they came in a generous portion. The interior and exterior of the restaurant is really cool, there were 2 bars inside, and the patio had a fair amount of space heaters which is always a plus. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was back in Cleveland over the holidays and met a friend out at Market Garden for some appetizers and drinks.  After being told by the hostess that we could look for our own table downstairs, we headed back upstairs and luckily found two recently vacated seats at the bar.  They have decent beer with very high ABV, and I found myself starving and needing some food fast.  We ordered the cheese fries and a beet salad.  I was excited to see pimento cheese on the fries, which is something I have only seen in the South.  I went town on those cheese fries--they were AWESOME!  The crowd at Market Garden got progressively annoying and more hammered throughout the night.  I enjoyed the bar and spending time with my friend, but maybe I just getting too old for the Ohio City bar scene."}
{"text":"Starting first with the positive, very nice atmosphere and quick friendly staff.  On the other hand, the food was horrible!  Went there for Sunday brunch.  The beignets were basically fried, overlooked lumps of dough.  The maple glaze looked and tasted like congealed grease.  The scotch eggs were also overlooked, hard and very dry.  The sausage had no flavor and the only taste came from the side condiments."}
{"text":"I have past this brewery several times during my trips to Ohio City, but I was never intrigued to step into it until today. We were out visiting my little brother, who was swearing by the beer. I was very surprised by how spacious the place was on the inside although it was a little dark even for the afternoon. If you cut through the bar they have an amazing back patio lined with long high top tables! It is such a fun environment. I wish I could see it when its all packed out. They even have heaters above each table for when it's cold out at night. Also, as you can see from my photo, they have a really awesome beer flight. The \"sampler\" beers are much larger than what you would typically get for the same price. I would highly recommend this place and hope to go back some day."}
{"text":"We were here on the Cleveland Brew Bus tour, and really enjoyed it. I love wheat beers, and was really impressed with the Prosperity. I look forward to finding it at the grocery store. The growler fills were generous, only $9 for 64 oz beer I chose. The atmosphere is top notch, very trendy, and is a huuuuge space. I liked the food we tried. The Cajun wings were the bomb. They were crisp, not overly breaded and had tons of white meat and flavor. The beer cheese soup was good but came out luke-warm."}
{"text":"Two words: Scotch egg. This unholy union of hardboiled egg swaddled in sausage sounds utterly revolting, but makes for a very tasty and substantial snack for four people. I think it had its own gravitational pull. My party also enjoyed the black bean and battered rock shrimp tacos. The shrimp were lightly battered and had just the right doneness. I think I could have eaten a large bowl of those by themselves. Beers are generally on the right track, but could use some fine-tuning. The Pearl Street Wheat is my favorite so far. Atmosphere is congenial and relaxed, but fairly loud when crowded. I'll be interested to see how this place grows up. It's off to a good start."}
{"text":"Really poor service. We were at our table for an hour, no waiter came to assist.   Eventually someone came to take our order. The food was cold! But hey! The sides were hot! Lol. We returned the food and asked for them to earn it up. Lo and behold, long wait time! Cleared our tab and went to the next restaurant for dinner.   Not coming here again. Oh, btw the old fashioned was sick! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday. 45 minute wait when there were visibly tables available. Slowest service ever. Took 15 minutes just for water. Food took over an hour... and when the food finally arrived we didnt have silverware to eat it! I will never, ever go here again for food. Waiter was not bringing water to the table, never refilled our coffee, didn't do anything to make up for the insane wait time for our food, even though he commented that it was taking long. Ridiculous service. Horrible."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!! The service is always amazing!! The beer is not always the same since they brew their own stuff which makes it even better!! I love love love their wheat beer known as \"Prosperity Wheat.\"  It is one of the most popular beers that they brew and is served year round.    I always bring my out of towners here because their food and beverages are awesome sauce!!! So if you're looking for a local brewery this place is an awesome place to try out!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch at this restaurant.  I loved Market Garden Brewery's take on an Eggs Benedict.  I typically think of Market Garden Brewery as my place to have beers on the patio when the weather permits in Cleveland.  Breakfast is more of a guaranteed thing, however, since you can still eat inside even when it is ten degrees outside.  The base of the Eggs Benedict was as expected - your typical, buttered, open-faced English muffin.  Greatest novelty and best part of the dish was the use of delicious, juicy, well seasoned pork belly.  The eggs were poached perfectly.  Also, the dish looked great too.  You can season it with sriracha, which gives the food a welcome kick.  Potatoes and coffee were average.  You may want to substitute your potatoes for fruit or have a flight of mimosas instead of coffee.  Pork belly, however, should become a standard part of the Eggs Benedict recipe.  So much better than bacon or ham.  Also, great open space and plenty of seating on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great beer!  The Trouble IPA and the Pearl Street Wheat were my faves."}
{"text":"Really tasty IPA (Citramax) and the market salad was really fresh and flavorful. The vibe is modern and casual. Fast and friendly service. All around great spot. Will be back."}
{"text":"For brunch, the cleveland bagel egg + mushroom sammie is SOOOOO good and the pitcher of mimosas is the way to go."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance and great spot to stop after a stop at the Westside Market.  Had beer and the hummus appetizer.  Yum and wow"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS for the food, great beer, and atmosphere. Minus 3 for the service that really killed the visit. Sat down and were promptly greeted by a super friendly fella possibly named Daniel (according to the check). Got us a drink / app order in and made it back for a dinner order. All was well. Beer and cheese board was fantastic and we were having a good time. Other people brought out the food and our drinks ended up sitting empty for a long time. I think some of his buddies came in and that was enough to forget the rest of us... After a bout of us staring at our guy for a while attempting for some eye contact (you know, where you think you can somehow get their attention from across the room using your mind or something) Finally went to the bar to order more and as the finished food plates were slowly collected one-by-one with passing kitchen staff we never got another check in. Had to yet again go up to the bar to get my check. They say never go to bed mad right?...Same should be said for restaurants...It is never fun to leave mad. Makes for poor Yelp reviews. Plus, there are plenty of other fine places in the area...even if 4 or 5 of them are owned by the same people."}
{"text":"Oof. This is a tough review to write. Lots of good and bad going on here, and it averages out to just a 3 star review when I'd love to give them 4-5 stars!  The good: Beautiful patio, LOTS of space/seating, and really tasty beers! I liked the variety of items on the menu to choose from - varied enough to have options, but not overwhelming. A really cool neighborhood and conveniently located next to West Side Market.   The bad: The service here, while friendly, was reaaallllly slow. I think they just simply didn't have enough bodies to service all of the tables, which was surprising given that it was a Sunday afternoon. The two hostesses were kind of aloof/disinterested in seating us when we first arrived, and we were told we'd have to either wait 45+ minutes or be seated separately due to not enough internal seating (rain was supposedly on the way, but never arrived). Our group of 8 was split into two groups of 4, and then about 5 minutes later a full table opened up that would have accommodated all of us. Oh well.   The ugly: I had to ask the server to bring out two of the toppings that should have been on my tacos. I am really never one to complain or send food back, but my tacos were missing both the cheese and the pineapple salsa on top. Dude- I only choose those tacos because I wanted that dang pineapple salsa, so OF COURSE I'm gonna notice if it's missing! Especially because the tacos only really have about 4 ingredients to begin with. The server went to the back and brought out a teeny tiny cup of the cheese. Didn't bring the pineapple salsa. He said he'd check again. Finally, came back with the salsa. I assembled my tacos, which were tasty. I don't know if this is just a hurried kitchen or an attempt to shave a little off of their bottom line by hoping no one would notice that they skimped on the ingredients, but either way, it was a bummer.   Perhaps this was an 'off' day. I hope so. I suspect I'll be back, as my in-laws live in the Cleveland area and we visit Ohio City occasionally. I hope I can have a better experience and bump up my rating next time. Either way, the beer and food are very good, so I still recommend this brewpub!"}
{"text":"My waffle sandwich and potatoes were very good. Didnt have to wait for a seat. Food came in not too long."}
{"text":"Great service, decent food and beer."}
{"text":"So the beer was pretty decent but we went there around 830 pm and the beer cheese and pretzel that we ordered was delivered as beer cheese soup, not a big concern. We're flexible. Tried the soup, but one taste of it and we could tell it was incredibly burnt. Horribly burnt. I fact, I could smell how burnt it was when they set it down at the table. We sent the beer cheese soup back and told them that we had originally ordered a pretzel with beer cheese anyway. Warned them that the beer cheese soup was very burnt. After about 30 minutes they gave us a pretzel to go along with a side of \"beer cheese\" which we got home to find out was actually just more of the same burnt potato beer cheese soup. Very poor customer service. Very disappointed. Sad."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday and was worried it might be difficult to get a table, but there was actually no wait to get seated and I noticed that the inside of the restaurant is actually quite spacious!   Our server was super friendly, and we were promptly given menus and water after being seated. I ended up ordering the pierogies and the mimosa flight. I think that the presentation of the flight is very cute - great for those Instagram photos haha, and all of the mimosa flavors were pretty tasty! The pierogies were pretty good as well but definitely really heavy.   The entrees here are pretty pricey (the pierogies were $18), but I would probably come back to try some of their other dishes. If anything, the mimosa flights are worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles and mimosa flight. They ran out of champagne towards the end of brunch and the breakfast potatoes which was annoying."}
{"text":"Market Garden Brewery is known for great beer served alongside a creative and unpretentious menu. That certainly was our experience here today. The crowd is mixed, from families to adults hanging out. My daughter and I went to The West Side Market then came here after we finished shopping. We sat in the bar area, and had a nice time just the two of us. We ordered parmesan garlic chicken wings for an appetizer. Served piping hot, they really hit the spot. For lunch, l had beef cheek tacos, and my daughter had chicken and waffles. Keep in mind, she's a kid who chooses Kraft macaroni and cheese nine times out of ten. And she loved her chicken and waffles! The few bites she had left leftover she made sure we got a box to take it home. That's how good it was! I thought the beef cheek tacos we're done nicely, and I made them a little bit better by adding some of the poached pear from my daughter's Chicken and Waffles to my tacos. I know it's sounds a little weird, but it really tasted good! Probably the chef would do a facepalm if he saw me do it! I didn't have any beer today because I was the only driver. But, I've had plenty of Market Garden Brewery beer in the past, and it's always top notch. Whether you're looking for an IPA, or a portar, or a pilsner : They have everything you might want from a beer lineup. If you're meeting friends, or need a fun place for dinner with the family, Market Garden Brewery is a great choice."}
{"text":"We sat in the courtyard patio, which was really nice, on a weekday afternoon.  Great vibe, and I have no real complaints.  I would definitely go back!  The beer was excellent, and they had a good selection to choose from.  Service was not exactly friendly, but very efficient, professional, and polite.  I got steak \"tacos\" that were also good, although I was not blown away.  It was not your traditional take on steak tacos (that was a Lot of cilantro!), but that's not what you go to a place like this for."}
{"text":"Worst experience i had during my time in cleveland. Hands down no questions asked, let me start this experience. After many locals tell me to eat here because of the food and great service i take my uber from downtown here.  I walk to the door and stand at the host/hostess for 15 minutes before i get tired of waiting to be seated when they had seats at the bar and other tables.  I sit down, almost immediately greeted with hey there--thats it.  Another few minutes go by and a young man says what will  we be having, told him a crown and coke and since i had to look up the menu online i ordered the brisket burger, cooked medium.  He typed it all in on the computer, before i even got my drink he brought the bill and said that'll be 22.68.  I was shocked. I was like i haven't even gotten my food or drink yet, why do i have to pay, what if i desire to have another drink.  Direct quote, he stated do you have a point or are you going to pay.  I gave him my card reluctantly, but i was really wanting to see if the food was as good as the locals said.  So i get my drink, not a standard 1.5oz pour closer to a .75.  Ok, not a big deal, get halfway done when the food comes, it got tilted towards me and slid across the bar as he said there ya go. Walks off.....not to get napkins,silver ware or ask if i needed anything else to drink. So I'm eating my food, looking at the 6 bartenders trying to get someones attention to get a glass of water and napkins to no avail.   I'm now 3/4 done with the burger, and really happy i didnt bring up the fact it was cooked well done, not medium like i asked because at this point, i have no faith or trust in this place.  Ii reach over to the stack of two coaster napkins and attempt to use them to wipe my hands so i can sign the check and fill in the tip amount because nobody deserves to go without, but as i was signing a young lady came up and said finally finished? ---i said yep,wheres the bathroom i need to wash my hands because there's no napkins......she wouldn't tell me told me to sit down she will get some.  I said fine, out of hospitality.   Not once was i asked how my food was, if i could get another drink or anything else. Honestly 40 minutes of being ignored like i had leprosy branded on my head.  I walked and and didn't look back and most certainly will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is great and so are the drinks! Lots of room for sitting and the outside patio is great during the summer!!"}
{"text":"Delicious beers.  We didn't try any food, we just went to sample their beers and they were great!  I will definitely go back here again if I'm ever back in Cleveland.    The space is huge and has a large bar to sit at if you don't want to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review and say if it was based solely on the beer, it would be 5 star. Sadly, this review is based on my lunch. Market Garden Brewery is located in the heart of Ohio City and has expanded recently, focusing more on the brewery aspect, which has caused their food and service to suffer, in my opinion.   The host greeted me and sat me at my table. After 5 minutes or so, he returned as my waiter. I ordered a diet coke to start and that was where things ran down hill. The diet coke was either expired (I worked in restaurants and I know what awful, expired product tastes like), or something in the distribution system failed. It tasted like colored, wet sweat sock water. It took about another 10 minutes to find someone else to get another diet coke for me. Between the bar back drinking his coffee and the bartender wandering around, it was a challenge. The bartender grabbed another diet coke for me after I explained my plight, and I could tell it was still bad when he was pouring it. He kept looking at it and then filling a little. Looking at it and filling a little more. Looking again, and filling again. It was still awful. By this time my food had arrived and my server finally came back, and this time I asked to replace my diet sweat sock water with an iced tea.   One major peeve I have with any restaurant is if I ask for a recommendation and the response is, \"everything is good.\" No, not *everything* is good. I ordered to Cubano sandwich which in reality was a mustard sandwich with some hot and some warm and some cold pork. The fries however, were ok. Those were hot.   The atmosphere is great, I just wish they put a teeny bit more effort in to the service. It would make a world of difference.  Note to the staff, smiling is ok."}
{"text":"Met another couple for an afternoon brunch. They suggested this place, as they'd been there before. When we walked in, the atmosphere was great. We were seated quickly and waited for our friends to arrive. Once our friends arrived it took the waiter awhile to take our beer order. I tried a sampler of beers which were pretty good and the others were pleased with their choices as well. After bringing the beers, the waiter disappeared and never asked for our food order. Once we finally got his attention, we ordered our food. We started with splitting an order of the Scotch Eggs. I was a little nervous as I've never had these before. WOW, they were great. Chorizo encrusted hardboiled eggs! They were delish!! That was the highlight of the dining experience. The waiter took forever to bring our entree's and actually had to flag him down and ask where our food was. He came back and said it'll be a minute or so longer (as if the kitchen was behind). Another 10 minutes passed and he finally brought out two of the four entree's. They happened to be the Brisket Burgers that the guys ordered. They were both ordered \"medium rare\" and came out \"well done\" and it were luke warm. He said it was going to be another minute for the Eggs Benedict for the ladies. When they finally showed up, they were over cooked and not very good. The waiter never asked how the food was and seemed to care less what our dining experience was. I again had to flag him down for the check. What a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"We waited more than twenty minutes at the bar to order a drink; all of the bartenders ignored us.  We were a small group of young professionals out for a rare night out; we ended up leaving and going to a different bar in the area without spending a penny here."}
{"text":"This was sort of a bummer. The atmosphere was pretty cool, and the service was nice. However, I ordered some 'mixed plate' or something along those lines at the waitress's suggestion, and got a wooden board with teeny, tiny little scraps of food on it. It was $12 (please see enclosed photograph of my baby meal. Mind you I had eaten about 2 itty-bitty apple slices before taking this photo).   For $12, I expect - and usually get - a heck of a lot more than a slice of cheese and a tablespoon of bacon bits. Not only did I feel ripped off, it wasn't anything I couldn't buy at the grocery store and put together myself for a fraction of the price.  And lastly but not leastly, my boyfriend didn't like his chicken and waffles, and said that the gravy overpowered the whole dish and made the waffles kind of disgusting (apparently gravy and waffles don't mix well).  There are too many brunch options in Cleveland to return to Market Garden Brewery. It seems like a cool place to drink, but don't eat brunch here unless you want to leave poor, hungry, and have to stop for a bagel on the way home."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, patio and the service at Market Garden are all really top notch.  The food here doesn't get as high of marks. To start we had the brewmasters platter for an appetizer which I liked a lot.  I tried the Mac & cheese with the braised duck for an entree, I found it to be bland and for $18 I felt pretty disappointed.  The girlfriend tried the muffalleta sandwich and did not like it, I gave it a try and thought it was better than the Mac and Cheese but it wasn't anything special.   As they had one of my favorite beers on tap (Southern Tier Pumpking) I didn't get around to trying any of there house brews, although my friends tried several and seemed to like them all.  I was really torn between giving Market Garden Brewery 3 or 4 stars.  Our entrees really were really disappointing for the price.  I feel I need to give the menu another go and hope for a better outcome. No matter the result I would definitely return here to drink, eat an appetizer and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Went for a laid back Sunday, apparently the patio service staff also came in for a lazy Sunday. Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive, I joined the table late, then waited another 15 minutes before just starting a tab at the bar. Waitress must not have been aware we wanted to actually eat, or drink, because our order wasn't taken until she came to tell us she needed to take our brunch menus and trade them for dinner menus..    The three stars are from the service, simply put, we felt quite ignored and as if we were an inconvenience.   The food was very creative and well presented, the in house picked veggies had a simple and delicate brine to them which really highlighted the vegetables' crunch. I'd never has an un-breaded  fried scotch egg, not bad, but much like the rest of the food, the sausage casing the egg was very heavily spiced, and covered up the flavor of the egg and creaminess of the yolk. There was significant \"spice\" to all the meat dishes we tried- not off putting and probably done to complement or contrast with bold flavors in the beers produced here, but if you're in anyway sensitive to \"heat\" be wary.   I realize I'm rambling now, I blame the citramax"}
{"text":"The food was great; however our server could definitely use a lesson in customer service. We had to wave him down for things like service platters. Did not apologize to us when the kitchen ran out of a certain item. Hardly spoke more than 2 words to us; didn't check on our food, spilled water on the table when refilling our water. Didn't offer us dessert nor offer our checks. We should not be waving down our server for every little thing."}
{"text":"We love market garden! The beer is always at the top of its game and the food is excellent and reasonably priced(every menu item)."}
{"text":"My experience at market garden was poor for several reasons: 1) the server took about 45 min to get our drink orders, coming randomly every 8-10 minutes and taking one order before walking away again. I was never asked if I needed another drink even though I was there for over 2.5 hours.  2) we were a 21st birthday party and the server did not smile or even wish our birthday girl a happy birthday. Like seriously?! 3) the server charged us 20% group gratuity even though we were a party of 7 (not 8, like the menu says) and then didn't even apologize when I asked her to follow the policy and reprint our checks  4) my veggie burger fell apart as I ate it and I had stomach problems for the rest of the evening   There was only one saving grace, the drinks were tasty. I appreciate that they used a nice gin for my g&t. For that they earned 2 stars instead of 1.  Market Garden-- if your servers hate their lives and show it, maybe it's time to hire some fresh blood."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  The server was nice but very slow.  Took over an hour to get our food. None of the food arrived at the same time.   Drinks were good; however, I stayed away from the beer and ordered a cocktail. Consensus was: beer was palatable if you mix it with lemonade.  The bar is limited; note that there is no martini/cocktail menu.  So the bar was mediocre. I ordered the pretzel as an app; this was very good, but the garlic cheese spread had no flavor.  Plain, or with the mustard, this is good. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was unfortunately inedible.  It arrived with the chicken very dry and seemed to have been fried in old grease for too long, it tasted burned and it crumbled (see photo). The outside was greasy; the inside dry.  It was really bad-I've had better from BK.  The fries were tasty; just had some Lawry's seasoning salt or similar. Took a long time to check out...I was here from 7pm-10pm; I left about fifteen minutes after my entree was served (my friend was *still* waiting for her tacos when I left, and I asked for the check as soon as my gross sandwich hit the table.)  Server saw that I was leaving my food and she didn't ask if I wanted a box or why I was leaving it.  It was such a greasy, hot mess...I had to get away from it as fast as possible!  No one even wanted to try it, it was that gross.  Run, don't walk, to Town Hall for better food and drink.   Regarding reservations: my friend said that she tried to reserve a table for her party and the manager never returned her call.  What kind of place needs a \"manager approval\" before reserving a table for eight?  Either accept reservations or don't. I really don't think I'll ever come back here, Town Hall is so much better. Also, the patio is nice, but the high top seating is uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Been frequenting the beer garden this summer with friends, and while the garden is amazing and the beers are solid, the food has lapsed a bit I feel. Inconsistent, some stuff not very flavorful (chicken tacos, black bean burger). Still 4 stars just for that damn beer garden (DO NOT call it a 'patio')!"}
{"text":"I took my family from out of town here for dinner and we all enjoyed our meal! We sat outside and enjoyed the warm weather, and it was nice to know the heaters were above the tables for when the temperature dropped a bit.   They have over 20 beers on tap, and you can get a sampler of 4 4.5oz beers for $9. They also have 'guest beers' that included bumbleberry in May.   I had the salad with roasted strawberries and lemon vinaigrette with grilled chicken. The kitchen allowed me to substitute the cheese for a different type of cheese with no upcharge. My family ordered the burger, brisket, veggie burger and sausage pizza. Everyone enjoyed their food, and the veggie burger had avocado on it which was yummy!   I've also been for brunch, and my guests LOVED the scotch eggs. They aren't easy to make so I was surprised to see them on the full menu! I'd recommend trying them if you want to try something different. It's an egg rolled in chorizo then breaded and fried-great to split between two people."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late dinner (9:30) on Labor Day. Instructions were to seat ourselves and order at the bar, but service of drinks and food after were prompt. We had the chicken sandwich and chicken tacos.  The chicken in the sandwich was generous and well-cooked, and the accompanying fries were crispy outside with a creamy interior.  Yum!  The chicken tacos were similarly tasty--flour tortillas with shredded chicken in a smoky sauce topped with cotija cheese and tomatillo sauce, with pickled jalapeños and guacamole on the side.    It was quiet tonight with just a few people at the bar watching the game, but I've seen it much busier during prime hours. Definitely a great option for late night food in Ohio City other than my go-to Bar Cento."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best seasonal beer in town! Patio is awesome and staff are always fun."}
{"text":"Being just down the road from great lakes has to be a feat for any brewery. We love checking places out like this and I'm glad that Cleveland has so many micro brew spots. Anyway, we went with another couple who actually brew their own beer so It made for a great evening. We were in on a Sunday, though we opted for dinner instead of brunch. As far as the food goes, we were very impressed, he and I both had tacos. He had the smoked pork and I had the spicier chicken option, both were awesome! The fresh slice of jalapeño on the plate was a very nice touch. Perfect portioning and left nothing else to be desired. Onto the drinks, I was impressed to see that they offer multiple flights for $15, most places you only get three for that price.  I had the old school, which I loved, light and easy to drink. My one gripe is that they had no white or blonde style brews :( so I was stuck with that most of the night. He had a few of their ipas and really enjoyed the powerful hops. Their selection of other beers was quite good as well, but I was there to try their own. Overall atmosphere was great, it was a nice evening so they had the big windows open and it gave a great vibe. The service was pleasant and the staff was attentive. We will be back and hopefully they will have something else that fits my beer palette."}
{"text":"Everything started great. Then we waited two hours for our food. And about 45 minutes before we could get a drink. And we were at a table. With a reservation. And the food was cold when we finally finally got it. And my brothers steak was cooked wrong. Luckily we had heads up so we can entertain ourselves during our two hour wait."}
{"text":"Went here for a business type dinner. First, I'd say the beer menu is 5/5. We shared some flat breads, a beer braised pork one and a sweet potato /squash one, and both were delicious! For my meal I ended up getting a maple turkey sandwich, which was kind of disappointing. Not that it was bad, just nothing special. However, if you're looking for a place to try new beers, I'd recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 20 for the downstairs Ohio City Room for a Saturday a couple weeks ago for 9:30 p.m. We had taken our middle school basketball team to watch St. Ignatius. The waiter tells us they are out of burgers and wings. We had one waiter for all of us. Needless to say, drinks were slow coming, food took forever , and the one thing a customer should never have to wait for is to pay the bill. There were two other large parties in the room. How do you not have staples nor enough servers? Its not like we just showed up. Plus, Dave's Supermarket is a block away! Run get some burgers and wings! The waiter gave some people a discount on their tab but that doesn't make up for all the wasted time and lack of food. Plus, the waiter saw we had 10 kids with us and we waited forever to get out of there ."}
{"text":"This brewery had great beer! Since I am a big wheat  beer fan, I tried the Pearl Street Wheat beer and really enjoyed it.  The pretzel sticks with mustard dipping sauce was my favorite appetizer.  I highly recommend pairing them with their beer cheese dip.  Great atmosphere on weekends!"}
{"text":"Service was poor,  food was awful and just overall bad experience. I ordered a Caesar salad and it had no dressing on it and the dressing that was on it had no taste...... Please change it up a bit."}
{"text":"The food is good, get the tacos or mac and cheese.  Yes I said mac and cheese - you won't regret it.  It's one of the top dishes I've had up with Gnocci at Luxe.  The beer is garbage though.  I think their brewmaster must be on crack cause my beer last night tasted like it had garlic and lemon grASS in it!!!  Do yourself a favor and order a Hopslam bottle."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with a very large group of ~20 around 5:30 on a Tuesday.  I called ahead for seating and everything was ready when we got there.  We were all able to sit together and even able to add seats for a few more people that came late.  Our waiter was great and friendly and had no reservations about serving a large group with separate checks.  Not many of us ordered food and mainly went for drinks.  I have to say, I was ready to be disappointed in the beer compared to the fine fare across the street at GLBC.  But I split a sampler with a friend ($15 to try 6 of the 7 brews they had on tap).  I was thankfully surprised - most of the beers were unique, high quality, and very flavorful.  I especially enjoyed the Festivus, their Christmas beer which has a nice spiced holiday taste, but is uniquely different than GLBC and most other holiday brews, as was more on the scale of a golden lager. The wheat beer and amber lager are also worth noting.  Some other people in my party ordered their beer cocktails and off of MGB's select menu of beers not made there.  Those were really good too, especially an Egg Nog/Festivus beer cocktail and New Holland's Dragon's Milk.  The ambiance/design of the restaurant was really nice. I loved all the CLE pride, especially the Beer-hio shirts.  I can't wait to come back in the summer to go to the patio which looked really nice.  Overall, I can say this place was really nice for a large group and has excellent beer.  I'm glad that this has added to the quality microbrews in Northeast Ohio.  I'm in Houston now and more microbreweries are popping up there, but most have substandard brews if they were compared to all the fare up in Cleveland.  I can't comment on the food, but I'd highly recommend it for a large group and good drinking!"}
{"text":"Maybe we caught them on an off day. I see most of the other reviews are very positive. The beer is very good, I sampled two different IPA's. I got the brisket burger which was OK, the brisket tasted like steak-ums to me. My wife's fried chicken sandwich was overcooked and tough. This is a cool spot and would come back to drink and for maybe an appetizer, but for lunch this neighborhood offers better options for the price this place charges. Decent but not worth the $80 we spent."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of MG, sad to say. I don't think the food is that good (or worth the price) and I don't like the MG brews on a whole, though there are exceptions.  I've had a few dinner items (tacos, brisket burger, chicken and waffles) and almost all of their beers, via flights. On this last visit, I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. It was super dry and over cooked, and the sandwich on a whole didn't have a lot of flavor :("}
{"text":"Hoppin spot!  In from out of town so we were eager to check out some new spots (no chains!) and hubby was excited about trying some new brews. This is a great spot to hit if that is your agenda.  Be prepared for a wait. I have a feeling they are busy like this, most of the time.  The service is good; by no means fast. Average at best.   Hubby said the beer selection was good.  I felt like the food was pricey but pretty much expected for a spot like this down town.   I ordered the chicken sandwhich and could only eat half.  The brioche bun was hella good.  Atmosphere was good.   Nice spot."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS. Their atmosphere is awesome!!! The food is awesome!!!! The beer is awesome!!!! Located in such a great area. Only downfall is that it's hard to find parking. But the awesome food and drink is worth it. I had a burger that was absolutely outstanding. I would go back any day for that burger. The service was great. Me and my boyfriend cannot wait to go back!   Please get parking spots for customers though, it'd be so much easier and faster for customers!"}
{"text":"Visited on a recent trip to Cleveland.  Loved the atmosphere and the beer.  Wish I'd been hungry enough to order from the food menu,  but I would definitely go back again.  Only complaint is that the hostess very pointedly ignored us in an otherwise relatively empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland from Detroit, a friend took me here for Sunday brunch before a baseball game. I don't eat eggs, so I typically have a hard time at brunch. But not here.  The grilled chicken sandwich with home fries was excellent. I also enjoyed the Scotch Ale outside. All in all, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Before you die, put MGB on your bucket list or just sign their iconic wall outside, but BYOC: bring your own chalk. This iconic neighborhood restaurant will lighten up your day, everyday. The appetizers are my absolute favorite, especially the mussels, pretzel bread and Cesar salad.  The outdoor seating is intimate and cozy with the heated fireplace, outdoor hanging lights and bar stool seating. Whether you come during the day, out for a night on the twin or to meet up with your family, you can do it all here.   Did I forget to mention they are a microbrewery too? Amazing!! Try it all here and never miss out again.  Bathroom tip: through the front doors and it will be on your left hand side before the next room."}
{"text":"I  shared the  the mussels michelada with my husband . The mussels were fresh and the tomato broth with fresh herbs and hops was delicious. The only thing we would have liked better would be if the chorizo and shrimp were  added to the broth just before serving. Those two ingredients seemed over done. Bread served with it to soak up the delicious tomato broth would have been appreciated.   Our server Bobby was very friendly and  attentive without hovering. We shared the Cubano sandwich as well. All the ingredients were perfectly balanced for a very enjoyable savory sandwich. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I held an event here for work in their downstairs room. It was great for a private event. After the event, we got a tour of the brewery, which is small, but fun. I then had to purchase a beer for over 30 people and the staff did a great job accommodating and moving quickly. The service was good. Some of us sat inside and some outside on their awesome patio."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends and the food was incredible. I started off with the pretzels, moved on to the pulled pork tacos and ended with some duck sliders. They were amazing and the beer selection is quite nice, as well. It's an upscale sports bar-type atmosphere and seems like a great place to hangout with some friends."}
{"text":"New place for us & we weren't disappointed!  Started with the Forest City Brown Ale - named the Best Brown Ale in the country by GQ magazine.  It was smooth & had a great flavor.  My husband had the Crispy Salmon which was GF - menu clearly marks & has many GF options on it - it's 8 oz of cold-smoked salmon pan fried with patty pan squash purée, blistered kalamata olives & grape tomatoes, salsa verde, & a chili garlic butter on top.  I had the Blackened Walleye Tacos (also GF) with a creamy Savoy cabbage slaw, watermelon-peach pico de gallo, bacon and grilled scallion gremolata.  We are outside on the sidewalk with a nice buffer of bushes & summer plantings. The meal was much nicer than we expected with steps taken to make each dish unique!"}
{"text":"Really cool patio with awesome fireplace.   Horrible service, constantly waiving down our server. All tables around us started joking about how slow it was. Excuse me.....if you want me to pay you will eventually need to bring me the check.   Not at all impressed with the food. Beef cheek sliders lacked flavor, except for the extreme salt blast, and the meat was stringy and chewy....the kind that you're still trying to get out of your teeth an hour later. Poutine was pretty good. Again...the salt. And then the hamburger. It may be made fresh daily at the market but it certainly was nothing special by the time it was served on the plate in front of me. Pretty dry (medium cook).  Just nothing special. Oh, unless of course you're looking for yet more salt of which it had plenty of.   I have always thought that if I were ever on a cooking show the first thing the judges would say to me is something like 'you're dish is way over salted, you need to learn to restrain your seasoning with salt. Pack your knives. You've been eliminated.'  I now know my only chance of lasting on said cooking show is if I were up against Market Garden Brewery.  Whoever was in the kitchen during my visit needs to turn in their apron ASAP.   Maybe I'll try the tacos next time. There will be a next time for the sheer happiness the patio and vibe the clientele brings."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer! I had the burger and the beef was extremely fresh and juicy.  My wife had the mac and cheese. That was also extremely delicious and loaded with bacon. The beer was also excellent too. We will definitely be back to dine again real soon. And their food definitely kicks the crap out of great Lakes brewery.  Everything is much fresher!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place on a whim and ended up having an awesome time. Our waitress (Cassie) was super nice and helpful. Would come back again, if ever in Cleveland. Their stout is amazing."}
{"text":"*Note: I didn't have a complete dining experience here, so there are many holes and unanswered questions in this review.  Take it with a grain of salt.*  In my opinion, Market Garden Brewery has the potential to be a really cool place.  The building is beautiful.  Setting in the fron with the full-length windows opening to the street makes for a great summertime place to sip drinks.    The beers that I had were passable, but nothing really to write home about.  I'm curious to try their collection.  I only had some snack foods, but I found them all to have a little twist that kept them interesting.  I liked everything that I had and am looking forward to an actual dinner in the future.  Some people have had some problems with service, but I found ours to be fairly adequate.  Our waiter was funny and did his best to make us feel welcome.  We were told by the hostess that we would have to vacate our table for a certain time due to a reservation.  He told us not to worry about it.  If it was a big deal, we shouldn't have been sat at that table in the first place.  It was nice to feel like our waiter was on our side and encouraging us to enjoy our stay.  I feel like I could learn to love Market Garden Brewery (especially, the ambiance).  I am highly anticipating my next visit to this establishment.  (BTW check out the beer garden.  It's pretty nice.)"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped by Market Garden Brewery for dinner on our recent date night. We were looking for food and beer. Market Garden recently expanded their brewery nearby and we haven't been here in a while.  We started off with beer, mussels, and a Scottish egg. The mussels tasted disgusting to me, but it's probably because they weren't served in garlic and butter sauce, which I've grown accustomed to. They were in a red sauce and I found the flavor of the actual mussels deplorable. My Scottish egg, however, was very tasty. I've never tried this dish before and I'm supposed to be Scottish! My beer was tasty, but I don't remember which one it was. Unlike other breweries in the area, Market Garden does not list the IBU of their beers on the menu, so ordering beer for me was a shot in the dark. However, I usually can't go wrong with a wheat beer, so that's what I ordered. For the same price, I got nearly twice as much beer as my wife, but they had approximately the same amount of alcohol in them.  Since we had visited Hansa prior to Market Garden, I wasn't starving. For dinner, I only ordered a bowl of beer cheese soup. It was delicious and I found myself scraping the bottom of the bowl wanting more.   I was so full that I couldn't finish my beer. Our server was very friendly and she visited us at just the right interval. Great service!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Terrible service. Very slow. No hard cider. Wine list is terrible. Bar service very slow and not helpful. Table service very slow. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Market Garden -- especially on a weeknight, when it's not overcrowded. I've had a couple meals there, but tonight I tried the potato and cheese pierogis.   The pierogis were delicious... just as creamy and rich as you'd hope they'd be. But they were an entree, and they didn't come with the brussel sprouts the menu said they would. It was five to six pierogis with sliced apples and a sauce drizzled on top. Very tasty, but not what to order if you're starving.   It's Festivus Ale season, so I tried one of those. Delicious and seasonal... and strong. Highly recommended if you want a good Christmas ale alternative.   Great atmosphere, handy service, and a great weekday find."}
{"text":"Hard not to recommend this place.  2 kids and 2 adults managed to find a good lunch here on a gorgeous day.  So many craft brew types on tap too.  I had the coffee porter - excellent.  We had a pretzel which was good.  I enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich and fries were excellent.  The kids found Mac n cheese and enough to eat.  The service was pretty slow but it was pretty busy owing to the unusually nice February temp."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about the menu at Market Garden Brewery. Unfortunately, they were out of SIX menu items. Specifically, we wanted to try the highly recommended chili and wings, but both were not available. Granted, this was on a Sunday, I think it's just no excuse. There are plenty of restaurants out there who have managed to keep their orders and stock in tune with their volume of business throughout the week.  Two weird items I'd like to complain about: (1) The booth table are mounted to the wall, leaving a fairly uncomfortable amount of space between the edge of the table and the back of the booth. (2) The underside of the table is furry. Yes, furry. While it seems to be a unique concept, think about how gross that will be in a few years.  In the end, all three of us ordered the Cuban sandwich - two with fries and one with a fresh, shaved veggie salad. This dish was not only delicious but made with local ingredients. I have no objections about the food or service that we particularly experienced.  I think that with better management and service over time, the Market Garden Brewery can only improve."}
{"text":"Awesome option if you're in the west side market area. Great food and drink. Phenomenal craft beer selection and creative comfort food options. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm from Portland, Oregon where beer is great and food is even better. I went to Market Garden for the first time yesterday and had a great experience. Had the beer sample and burger and friends. All were great. Service was also great.   I went back tonight (Saturday). Yes, it was busy, but there was enough staff on hand that slow service should not happen. It was just me at the bar. I had to ask for a beer, a menu, water, and to order. During that time, I saw several people standing behind the bar not busy. I waited about 30 minutes for a salad, which I eventually ordered to-go.   Beer and food are good. But I was disappointed on the service tonight."}
{"text":"we intended to go visit great lakes brewery while in town, but it was closed on sundays so we checked out this place instead. really glad we did. we had already eaten, so we didn't get to try any of the food, but the menu looked pretty good. my boyfriend and i split a sampler so we could eat try a few of the beers. i liked the ones i tried, as did he. so we got pints of our favorites. we also got a growler to go of my top choice - the dopplebock. strong and delicious, i'm a big fan. the atmosphere of the place was also intimate yet trendy. our bartender was super nice, he even bought us both a shot for coming 2 hours to visit his town!"}
{"text":"If your going for beer, do it! They have a great atmosphere and the selection of beer is wonderful. If you're going for food, you should probably just stay home. Pretzels were good. Beer cheese soup was more like a sugary fondue dip. I ordered the quinoa and chickpea burger which had no flavor and felt like dry mush. Instead of suffering, I ate the lettuce, tomato and avocado as a small salad. The al pastor tacos seemed to have lunch meat. Beware of all tacos here as they come on flour tortillas. The gluten free options is stale, crunchy on the edges corn tortillas. Our bill was over 200$ for five people and we ate maybe a quarter of the food that was ordered."}
{"text":"Market Garden Brewery is the newest addition to Ohio City's growing number of great places to go out and drink beer.  It's also the largest - the Brewery has several different large dining (drinking?) areas with two bars and a fantastic outdoor garden-ish patio-ish packed with long communal tables of people drinking beers.    I had the cuban sandwich and it was delicious - smoky pork on a huge bun and some really great fries with aioli were a delicious accompaniment.  They brew their own beer there, and it was very well-balanced and a little less hoppy than a lot of other microbreweries, which was a refreshing change.    The atmosphere was a lot like Bier Markt - people mostly go there for the drinks but it has a different, more upscale vibe.    In a nutshell:  great beer, good atmosphere, great food.  Best view of the West Side Market of any bar in town!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere more than the food and beer.    I've only eaten here a couple of times and really, nothing on the menu makes me salivate.  BUT, it's a fun place to go hang out with friends, and they've got a beautiful side patio with a fireplace and a nice people watching patio out front.  I guess they do comedy shows downstairs, too.  Get's kinda douchy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times for dinner and drinks and it's always pretty good! Today we decided to try for brunch and man, it did not disappoint!!! Had a delicious Mimosa flight of four different types of mimosas for $9 and an even more delicious breakfast poutine!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for the atmosphere and awesome beers on the patio in the summer (wahoo wit is one of my faves) .    However, I recently stopped in before going to the west side market and let me tell you I had the best Bloody Mary ever!!! So delicious! It had fresh horseradish in it as well as a smokey.  Never ordered a full meal here but the fries and other apps are tasty too."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch , opting to sit at the bar. The service was good , the bartenders attentive. We ordered a fried chicken sandwich that came with slaw, dill pickles and great seasoned French fries. There were two very large  pieces of chicken; perfectly cooked and extremely moist. The other item we ordered was Smoked Brisket Sliders; not as good, the plate came with four sliders green tomato mostardo, dill pickles and pimento cheese; that I did not get. The brisket was more fat than meat, no trimming done before they sliced the brisket for the sliders, extremely unappetizing, I would not suggest the sliders."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.   Wanted to go to Great Lakes but closed on Sunday so cabbie took me here. Was a great atmosphere, very clean. When the bartender found out I was from Florida he was very helpful in giving me insights on the beers we don't have there as well as offering up a flight for me to try without an attitude.   Wanted to try the smokey popcorn but they were out as they don't make it there. I guess it's one of those Sat morn market guys who makes it and sells it to them. too bad for me! Really wanted to try it..  the place was super clean, larger then expected, and had friendly (albeit a tad slow) service"}
{"text":"I had brunch with 2 friends and it was great!  We shared the breakfast board, and I ordered the 3-egg brunch dish.  Everything was delish, including the Mimosa flight!  The only thing I found odd was that the breakfast potatoes were French fries.  Now, I love me some fries, but I would have liked a different spin on spuds.  No matter, ultimately...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Saturday nights in Ohio City are busy. I get it. I'm not 21 with a perky bustline or a man bun. I get it. But my money is just as green, you know? Went here and had my companion go in and ask if they allowed dogs on the patio. Sure, no problem. We sat out there for half an hour with no attention from anyone despite there being a table of said perky bustliners behind us who saw a server - or some sort of attendant, several times. When I went back in to ask how long it would be before we got some service, a young waitress told me they don't have any servers. When I questioned this, she said something to the effect of when they don't have a hostess at the front counter, you have to come in and go to the bar - I guess either to place an order or to tell someone you'll be sitting on the patio and will need service.   Either way, I said to her that it would have been nice if \"Yes, we allow dogs\" guy would have informed us of this strange procedure instead of I guess assuming we were just there to sit for awhile.   After this and the over-salted food, I won't be back. We wound up going to GLBC as they do allow dogs on the patio and value attentive service."}
{"text":"Not sure why this was rated on the lower side.   We almost passed the place up, but we decided to try it because the menu was decent (and we didn't have to wait an eternity).   The beer is great!    It is exciting the choices, and having 2 wheat beers is always exciting for me.   I loved the Frosty, my husband tried a flight and  liked the Wallace (which I tried and surprisingly liked).   They also have a smoked beer that smells and taste like bacon (just an FYI).   Food was good and interesting.   The scotch egg had good flavor and tasted unique.    My burger was good and my husband's chicken was also good.    The place itself is interesting and I LOVE the decor.   They also have sound damping so it isn't super loud.   Our service was stellar, which was a relief (haven't had great service lately).     Definitely want to come back.   It looks like they change up their menu often, so don't count on everything in the pictures."}
{"text":"Great food, and service! Lindsey, Laura, and BJ were great bartenders and made us feel right at home. Definitely recommend this place. Don't recommend -Townhall, very shitty service and Food."}
{"text":"Great beers, great appetizers, great service, and always a great time. Their drafts are reasonably priced and they all have great flavor. Every time I've gone I've been seated at the bar and had a great time chatting with the friendly bar tenders and even other patrons. It's a friendly and inviting atmosphere where you can share good beers and a love of Cleveland. One of my favorite and must go to stops when visiting Ohio city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our dining experience at The Market Garden Brewery while visiting Ohio. They have a nice selection of beers. We started with a flight, which allowed us to sample from their selection of brews.  We also enjoyed the food items that we ordered- tasty, yet reasonably priced.  Great atmosphere, too!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great but service slow and the food was ok. Nobody seemed to care if we got served or not."}
{"text":"Nice to see another nice place in Ohio City.  Tried 3 of their brews and all were very good.  Had  a couple appetizers along with two fun dinner entree's.  Both were very good.  Smaller portions but overall very nice place.  Dined out on the patio facing the market.  Fun atmosphere outside and inside looked very fun as well with two big bar areas.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks a handful of times, so finally came for dinner. They allow dogs in both the back and front patio areas! My lil pup pup was so comfy and just chilled while we had some drinks and dinner.   I had the beet salad - really good. Shared the peach and brie flatbread with friend - didn't think the pesto would go well with peach, but it was pretty darn good. I also had a pear cider - that was delicious.   Came here on Tuesday night around 8:30, not too many people, so service was quick.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is really nice time for summer nights out. They have a huge patio in the back with benches and lights! They have many different beer selections as well tasty food! I have been a few times I really enjoy it. The only downside to is that it doesn't have any happy hour specials and during the weekends it could get really busy. Servers can lose track of their services!"}
{"text":"I know this was Sunday brunch at noon. We made a reservation and gave ourselves two hours before we had to be at a show at Playhouse. We arrived and were seated right away. The kitchen was out of Eggs Benedicts? How does that happen with two more hours of brunch left?? So I ordered a flat bread with eggs, bacon and hollandaise. After waiting an hour for our food, the flat bread was disappointing. Minimal toppings and NO sign of a hollandiase. The side of potatoes were over done. Then took another half hour to get our bill. HOW ARE YOU SUCH A SHIT SHOW WHEN YOU DO BRUNCH EVERY WEEK!"}
{"text":"Town Hall has \"Let loose The Kracken\" and I can now come back to Market Garden from time to time."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 0 stars if I could waitress told me it's not her job to take food orders at the table and that I had to do it at the bar at 10 pm bartenders are slow overall bad experience while the place was practically empty"}
{"text":"Cool brewery just outside downtown Cleveland, and next to several other breweries. It's right next to the city market. I tried the Cluster Fuggle, Viking, and Chinook Strike, and liked them all. Also tried a scotch egg, very cool. We just sat at the bar, and service was quick. There was a whole other area in back where a party was, and also an outdoor seating area. It's a good location, and a nice looking place. Ideal spot for doing a brewery call with say Great Lakes and nano nearby. Food menu looked good, next time I'll have to try that"}
{"text":"not bad, went to the downstairs bar which looks like something out of the Ikea catalog. I had the beer flight and frankly wasnt that impressed. the best beer I had was the Scottish ale, but the others were not memorable.  A bit too trendy and too full of sockheads for my taste."}
{"text":"Patio.  *Drops mic, walks away*  No, but seriously.  This is one of the best patios in Cleveland.  It faces the market, is filled with happy, smiling people, and serves some pretty awesome beers.  My favorite thing about Market Garden is the great experiences I've had here with friends over drinks and cheese boards.  My next favorite thing about Market Garden is the flawless service.  It really is the definition of what service should be - friendly, quick, informative."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 star review just for their meat and cheese board.  It was AMAZING.  Normally you expect to pay a decent amount of money to get fairly small portions of a couple meat and cheeses.  Not this place!  They gave us so much food, we were able to take some home and have a whole second snack session the next day!  The meat and cheeses they provided were delicious.  We also had scotch eggs which were great, and my husband had a beer sampler, which he really liked.  He started ordering and the waitress suggested an IPA sampler, which was a perfect suggestion."}
{"text":"Delicious beers for one. The perogies were very good, the fried chicken was great, and the salmon was amazing! The staff were friendly and helpful. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and left each time with the same opinion \"Eh, it was okay\". Granted I have come here mostly for lunch or brunch and not dinner so that may sway my view slightly.   Service here has been good each time I've visited. The hostesses are friendly and great you when you walk in, which is a major pet peeve of mine when they don't. The servers are communicative and rarely disapear on you. Both positives.  Decor is hipester trendy, with the reclaimed wood tables, decorative wood walls and large vintage neon signs.  It's a fun place to hang out and people watch.  Based on the previous 2 statements this should be a 4/5 star review.  However the food is what brings this review to 3 stars.  I find the food on their brunch/lunch menu to just be OK.  Nothing stands out as amazing to me.  Their smothered and covered can be a tad too salty and have under cooked eggs.  The chicken and waffles are good, not outstanding.  The quinoa burger is bland however the Al pastor taco's are very good.  The ham and egg benedict is okay, a little under cooked in the egg department.  I know everyone has different tastes, however when I get a sunny side up egg I prefer just the yolks stay runny - not the whites as well. I remember really liking the scotch eggs however I didn't see it on the Brunch menu this past weekend.  The Bloody Mary was good (spicy and strong) and the mimosa flight is always tasty.  Which brings me to the main reason for the 3 stars....has the brunch menu changed recently?? I remember there being many more breakfast options than my recent visit.  What happened to the omlets or scotch eggs from the brunch menu?? The menu this past weekend was much more lunch orientated at 11am than brunch.  There was maybe only 5 or 6 brunch-ish items (smother and covered, ham and eggs, chicken and walffles, breakfast burrito, regular pancakes/waffles).  Overall, it's not a bad place. The brunch menu is just really lacking and I probably wouldn't visit again unless they get a new menu."}
{"text":"My first time here we left because we were unable to find a seat at the bar. This time around however we snagged the last 2 seats at the front bar and had a good time - it became standing room only shortly after. Both bars were open tonight (Saturday), (unlike when we came on a Sunday before). The bartenders were attentive - when we first sat down 3 different ones asked if we were ready to order. Each time we said we weren't, but none of them offered to make a suggestion of what to order. After we eventually did order as soon as the glasses got low various bar tenders stopped by to offer a refill. Rather attentive for being so busy. A popular spot on the street so I'm glad I can finally say I've been here."}
{"text":"Market Garden is a go to spot on West 25th. Their beer is top notch, and they have some great options on their menu. Every time we go, even if it's not that busy, the service is always slow. While the menu offers some impressive items, I don't know if the execution of the items I've ordered have been everything they could have been. It's a solid spot to try, the ease of the location can't be beat, but I feel like the popularity of the place has allowed the place to lose their edge."}
{"text":"If you are interested in learning about craft beers or just want to taste four different beers for $6. I would highly suggest Market Gardens Brewery tour. The tour does not happen at Market Gardens, but at the store located on 24th Street. Which is behind all the bars. It is also a great activity to do with people from out of town. The first time I went with my parents and the second time was with out of state friends. Both times my guest had a blast.   Tip: For the tour you receive 4 little coins. Each coin represents a drink (sampler) you can get. Generally, you only use 3 on the tour and 1 has to be used at Market Garden Brewery. However, that coin does not go bad. So, if you are busy, etc you can save the coins for later.  Outside of the bar tour the brewery itself, located on 25th, is a really nice place to hang out. When the weather is nice I would suggest going to sit out on the patio. The only down side is if you intend to only get drinks you have to go to the bar. So, it is a little bit frustrating when you are outside and have to keep going back in. But, overall this is a really cool place to go to."}
{"text":"Continuing to enjoy some of The Forest City's beers, I stopped at Market Garden and nabbed a quiet table in the back. Well, it was mostly quiet until the sports on the big screen started to get interesting and the bros started getting deep into their beers. Well, that's part of the show, right?  Terrific selection of local beers here and some macros, but I stuck to the local stuff. Yes, please. Good service from my waitress who was happy to keep me hydrated with beer.  I also got something to eat to go with that beer. Their Turkey Reuben is a winner. Grilled, loaded with sliced turkey and Swiss cheese and Russian dressing (and pickles?), it went down a treat. The fries were decent though not great. A good portion, but a little floppy and not quite as hot as the sandwich. Still, quite good.  Neat spot to get some beers and some grub. Me likey!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and was left very disappointed. My Eggs Benedict was undercooked and cold. The pork belly was more like a thin, sliced roast pork and had little flavor or texture. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and his meal was also cold. His waffles were good and the gravy was flavorful but the chicken was cooked to death. The service wasn't great. There were many employees working but I noticed more seemed to be talking to each other. Also we came early so there were only a few diners there. The only good part of our meal was the beignets, which were delicious, but weren't enough to save our experience. We will come back for the beer but certainly not the brunch."}
{"text":"This place has ambience and beer. Particle Accelerator is delicious. I really like the selection of yummy beers. It's a large bar with a layout that allows patrons to mingle and move about freely, even when it's super crowded (which it always is). The decor is some of the nicest I've seen at a brewery. So many great accents such as lighting and beer taps. The courtyard is inviting, spacious and has a fireplace."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to spots on the near westside.  The in house brew is always on point, and the one reason I have to give it four stars is because they took the friend chiecken entree of the menu, which was literally the only fried chicken i have eaten in the last 10 years."}
{"text":"Had the most rude bartender I have ever experienced serve my friends and I drinks. Will not be returning due to her terrible attitude."}
{"text":"I've never been too much of a fan of this place. I never even made it downstairs to check it out. Normally I walk in have a beer by the door and leave. Its crowded, uncomfortably crowded. Something about the feng shui or whole ora of the place is off.   With that new place open you know the one that ruined Ohio city, It is a little more tolerable now."}
{"text":"We walked in the back of the patio.  Tried for min 10 min to get service.  The servers were so RUDE.  They just IGNORED us.  Finally, I asked one of them if we could order.  She said no, we had to be seated by hostess.  There is NO SIGN on the entrance we came in stating we need to see a hostess to get a beer on the patio.  Just RUDE staff who would have continued to ignore us, and they weren't even busy.  I honestly don't know if we will ever go back.  Service there isn't very good, and heaven knows, there are PLENTY of other microbreweries who don't give a if a hostess sat you or not."}
{"text":"We came in a large wedding party and the wait staff was unprepared for a large group. With two servers it took nearly 30 minutes to even get our drinks ordered. In addition, we were never told that we had to order from a specific menu for our meal, yet they had both menus on the table. Most people were trying to order from their regular menu and we were told we couldn't! The food was just okay. Burger was under seasoned and their pork tacos were okay at best. And to boot, the beer, while good, was grossly overpriced. So the service, poor, the food, nothing I couldn't prepare myself, and the beer, good, but not for the price if the food and service aren't acceptable. I was a first time customer and first impression, not suitable for large parties..."}
{"text":"Ordered the pastrami hash with a sunny side egg and got a over-cooked burnt egg (two times). They were slammed during Sunday brunch but we waited 40+ minutes for our food to come out. Our server, however, handled the situations well. She was very good, but the kitchen and management have a lot to work on. They did make it right at the end by having the manager apologize and give us our entrees for free. Overall, great environment and good waitress, but they have a lot to work on in the kitchen if they want to make money."}
{"text":"Come here for the drinks, not the food, which is sorely overpriced and frustratingly mediocre.  I will, however, vouch for their \"beer cocktails\" and the Scotch egg.   Just do yourself a favor and walk across the street to Bier Markt for your full meal."}
{"text":"The patio in the back is great. Especially on a beautiful day. That is the reason to come here. Unfortunately the hostess not super friendly and it took us 15 minutes to get our beers. We were told that the bars were backed up but there were empty stools and tables inside so that did not make sense."}
{"text":"Service was good and staff was very friendly, but the food was not that great. My friends didn't seem impressed with their dinners, and my dessert tasted burned.   I got the s'mores and really, really wanted this to be the dessert to end all desserts. I thought it might be slightly inventive. It wasn't. My five year old could have done better over the open burners of a stove (note to parents and children: I am NOT condoning the use of an open burner by a small child).   The details? The marshmallow sat on a graham cracker on chocolate. End of story. Again, please be more inventive. Oh, and it was burned, but not in a good way. That awesomely burned sugar flavor you get when your marshmallow catches on fire over an open flame is perfection, this was just 'oops, I left the marshmallow over an open flame, indoors, too long, and now it will taste like the bottom of an oven... when food spills over... and burns. Oh yeah, the graham cracker was burned too.   This dessert robbed me of calories I could have used to drink a cocktail. And that makes me angry."}
{"text":"Although I have enjoyed the beers at the Market Garden Brewery on the occasions that I have been there for drinks alone, I recently dined here for the first time and had a wholly underwhelming experience.   My husband and I were out in Ohio City last Friday night and we settled on the MGB for dinner. Although the beers were enjoyable, the food was roundly unpalatable.   We ordered the Brisket Burger, Garlic Bean Dip, and Roasted Cauliflower. Each dish was bland and greasy. For the quality, I also feel that it was overpriced. Since I could have dined at the GLBC or Flying Fig for roughly the same price, frankly, I felt slighted.   I wouldn't normally judge a brewery so harshly for serving disappointing vittles, but I feel that the MGB presents itself as equal parts brewery and restaurant. The menu is striving toward a level of culinary acumen that the dishes themselves do not deliver by half. I feel that they would do better to focus on a a few dishes that they do well.   Given the plethora of dining options in the neighborhood, I probably won't return any time soon. But, I do hope that the MGB can bring their food menu up to the quality of their beers!"}
{"text":"I've had two experiences here and overall they have been great. My mom came in from out of town and we wanted to take her somewhere local and cool for dinner so we chose the Market Garden Brewery. My mom even  had a beer and she NEVER drinks beer. My mom and I went for the Wahoo Wit while her fiance and my boyfriend got the Wallace Tavern Scotch Ale. Mine was crisp and tasty while my boyfriend declared that the Scotch Ale was his new favorite beer. The food was good though I was kind of disappointed that I got the pierogies when I saw how good the burger looked. The pierogies were delicious, but seriously, that was one good-looking burger!  The atmosphere is great, the prices are reasonable, and I look forward to going back and trying the patio. The only complaint I have is with the growlers. We went back to get a growler of the Scotch Ale on a Saturday afternoon to take to a family get-together and we couldn't get any of the 4 people behind the bar to even make eye contact with us. We seriously stood there for at least 15 min. I understand it was busy with market-goers, but come on. A simple \"be right with you\" would have sufficed. We finally had to wave our arms around like lunatics to get service. Then they slapped us with an $8 to-go charge for the growler. Now, I assume that this is to offset the price of the bottle, but we weren't expecting it and almost decided not to go through with it, but we were already salivating for the Scotch Ale. I hope that I am right in assuming that if we bring the bottle back in to be refilled, we won't be charged the $8."}
{"text":"Ok, so there may already be hundreds of reviews, but when I checked yesterday to figure out what to order, I was still lost.  Appetizer:  We got the pretzel, which was VERY disappointing.  For $7, I figured it should be something to share and I was expecting a garlic cheese sauce.  Alas, it was one single stick of pretzel with a side of whole grain mustard (too strong for the weak tasting pretzel) and a side of ricotta with garlic (what they cause garlicy cheese spread).  What a waste.  Their profit margin is probably $6.50 per pretzel.  NO VALUE.  Burger: I got the burger and ordered it medium rare.  It came out medium, which disappoints me for somewhere that it supposed to be meat oriented.  Otherwise it was good, but the fries...the FRIES!  Within 2 minutes they were hard as rocks.  How does that even happen?  Tacos: We got the chorizo tacos (better priced option).  They come default as hard tacos, which is silly because all the toppings (tomatillos/peppers/etc), didn't even fit in them.  They were sat on the side.  If you're going to serve hard tacos, make your own shells or create your own taco that FITS in the shell at least.  Note: You can order them as soft shell, which a friend did and they came out much better.    Overall.  I found  NO VALUE in the meal.  Next time I'll eat before stopping by.    I also REALLY hate that they have no happy hour.  Ugh."}
{"text":"The beer at Market Garden is good, the service is okay (not the friendliest, but still good!) and the prices and atmosphere are pretty decent.  I know it's a newer place so I'm sure it has a couple kinks to still work out here and there, but overall it is worth a visit!  I didn't try the food, so I can't speak for that, but the beer \"Sampler\" I got was tasty, on the whole! The Cycle Soda was extremely delicious and refreshing (though I would be hard pressed to ever order one, knowing the extremely low alchohol % I'd be getting!) and I really liked the Forest City Brown Ale.  I look forward to trying it again the next time I am visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Came here over the winter and got some drinks and apps with some friends. The food was fine, beer was good too, however service was kind of slow at the time. It was super crowded, so I understand."}
{"text":"Few breweries try let alone succeed in producing an authentic hefeweizen, and Market Garden certainly does. We were impressed and pleased with every aspect if the place, from decor to the presentation and flavor. The beer menu is excellent- few offer such a variety and fewer do lagers well. Our meal was equally well done and service was perfect. This will be a destination whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for a few drinks and their beer selection was excellent, many different kinds for each of our pallets. Their food is amazing, I recommend the chicken tacos, their bartenders aren't too bad to look at either."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, food and beers! I loved the bbq flatbread and my husband enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich. The place was packed at 11:39 AM - always a great sign!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Market Garden on Sunday. There were 4 of us who wanted to sit outside in the back. Hostess said it would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. We agreed to wait patiently, all the while watching her seat groups of 2 to 5 people. After about 10 minutes she comes back and informs our party that the wait is now 15 to 20 minutes. I'm convinced she forgot about our party (even though we were in plain view) and gave our seats to another party. She offered no explanation as to why the wait time changed so greatly. Then she offered to seat us in front by pushing 2 tables together. Not ideal, but since we were very hungry, we agreed.   We ordered 4 waters and 4 different beers each. Our beers arrived but we are still waiting on those waters. How can you remember 4 different beers but not remember waters? The menu was only brunch, which we werent aware of when we were seated. Apparently lunch isnt served until 4pm. We then decided to cash out without eating. We were never asked or given the opportunity to split the bill. It was very obvious that our party consisted of 2 couples.   So all in all, I was very disappointed with the service at Market Garden. The hostess could have at least been honest and said she mistakenly gave our table away. Plus, forgetting waters is unbelievable to me, the simplest thing anyone can order. Wish it was a better experience."}
{"text":"My husband suggested having lunch here after visiting the West Side Market.  The menu looked interesting and we wanted to try the beer.  It was a Saturday afternoon and busy.  It did not take long to be seated but it took a bit of time before our server arrived.  We ordered beer and ten minutes later he came back and said they were out of the beer we ordered, so we ordered different beer.  He came back again, they were out of that beer also.  He said whatever we ordered next was on him, which was nice, not his fault. The beer we finally ended up getting was very good.  The food was a different story.  The beer cheese soup was really salty.  (I read this on other reviews as well) The pork tacos had a funky taste, could not pinpoint it, but not good.  The side of beans served with the tacos were awful.  Prices were high, food was disappointing, doubt we will go back.  I don't think they will miss our business, the place was packed so obviously other people love the place."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5 people for a birthday dinner and the wait was long - long for no reason as there were PLENTY of empty tables (all with reserved cards on them). Perhaps it's a marking ploy to seem like it's a happening place or an ego stroke, whatever it may be, it made them look really bad. When we went up to ask them about the wait, after 30 mins of smelling the skunked air inside, a table just so happened to 'open up' right then - wow. We were escorted through the mostly empty restaurant to get to the mostly empty outside area in the back to a dirty table and waited a bit for a server to come out. The decor and vibe of the place was great and the outdoor area had heaters and a large fireplace - also lots of long tables which are good for groups (if they ever get seated). Our waitress came out with the best rbf we've ever seen, she definitely did not want to be there. Perhaps staffing was the issue, but even then if that was the case then just be up front about it - people are understanding. No need to put up a front and act like they are so busy. The table ordered a couple of drinks (a beer and signature cocktail)  along with the curry mussels, fish tacos, beef tacos, chicken and waffles, and a salad. The food was all really good, and all the back staff who brought out the food were very attentive and pleasant, hence the higher rating. The mixed drink was not consistent (a person in our party ordered it the week before) and when they mentioned it to our server, our server said it's because all the bartenders make the drinks differently. Oh ok, a signature cocktail with variation. The highlight of the meal were the curry mussels and the chicken and waffles - the smoked blueberry honey accompaniment to the chicken and waffles definitely elevated the dish and it was the most inventive thing we ate in Ohio. The food here is good and the ambiance is nice - they just have to step up their cleanliness and front of the house to reach their true potential."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Saturday night. Food was delicious. Had BBQ popcorn for appetizer. It was surprisingly good. Tried 4 different beers (sharing between friends) each one was as described and well done. Would recommend this place as a dinner spot or a night out during bar hopping."}
{"text":"Hitting new breweries in cities around the country is one of my past times. This brewery rocks the beers across the board. From their signature Prosperity Wheat to the Wallace Tavern, they know how to brew beer. Check this place out if ever in Cleveland! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday night meal. Their tacos are delicious and the beer menu is extensive. Everything on the menu is between $10-15, minus the steak entree, and is prepared quickly.  I would recommend making a reservation - their tables fill up quickly- and their high tops are available for shared service. My party of 7 was seated in a solo booth because we reserved in advance! It's perfect for a small birthday gathering."}
{"text":"Delicious, extremely creative menu. Excellent beer, as well as some really great mixed drinks. And I love their outdoor seating area!"}
{"text":"I find it odd that I'm saying that one of my favorite bars to grab drinks in Ohio City is just A-OK. But, after thinking about the overall and taking into account the food, it really does just average out to A-OK.  Like I said, I absolutely LOVE coming here to drink. The beer selection is good when I'm in a beer mood and they make my vodka drinks strong when I'd rather drink that (most of the time). And, if we can snag a table or a few seats on the patio (heated - but not enough to be out there in the dead of winter), then I love it even more. Depending on the night, sometimes it's pretty hard to grab a drink, but usually when you've gotten the attention of one bartender once, they tend to gravitate to you the rest of the night- so just keep going to the same person.  The bartenders are pretty friendly for the most part. On busy nights, they seem pretty stressed but you can tell they enjoy what they're doing and enjoy working with their coworkers, which makes things go smoothly.   As far as the food goes, I think that's where it's really just meh. I've had multiple food items and have never been overly impressed. I've had the pretzels, cauliflower steak, mac and cheese, pierogies, beer cheese soup, tacos, and fries and out of all of them, I would say I enjoyed the Pierogies the most and would actually recommend them over anything else on the menu..  All in all, like I said, I love it as a place to grab drinks and will continue returning for that purpose. But, for an actual meal, you'll find me somewhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Alternative vibe here. Got the stout pretty good. Old school lighter lager very good also. Bathrooms and quieter section of the bar downstairs...check it out. Service great."}
{"text":"This place is one of Cleveland's finest.  Great outdoor (back) patio.  Tons of local food options.  Fantastic craft beer option (go with a sampler).  Taco's are all excellent.  Great merch as well for purchase!  This place is a no brainer for awesomeness."}
{"text":"This place was a great experience on so many levels. They have a nice outdoor patio and the inside is spacious with a wall divider for private parties. The service was fantastic - our server navigated through the beer and food orders flawlessly, providing some solid recommendations and making sure we had what we needed with good nature and humor. The sea scallops, poutine, and cheddar chorizo pierogis were all delicious. Of the nearly 30 people who came by, everyone left satisfied."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good brewed beer, and decent food makes this place a solid 4 stars! We split the BBQ popcorn while waiting for a table...good flavor but a little too spicy for my hubby. I had the fried chicken which was good but I'm not a huge fan of the collard greens that come with it. Hubby said that the chicken tacos were very good but he forgot to ask for no onions...icky! Our food was taking a while so our server brought us some homemade chips to munch on which were also good."}
{"text":"As much as I love Market Garden's beers and space, I've had a love/hate relationship with the food. Basically I love to keep eating it and pretty much every time I end up feeling sort of \"womp womp\" and underwhelmed. While I wouldn't go as far as saying that its a 'hate,' I've definitely left slightly sad-faced and disappointed. With that said, I recently ordered the Cheddar and Potato Pierogies and they were delicious! Chillin' in a brown butter carrot puree (this sounded questionable at first but was really savory), the pierogies were perfectly packed with cheddar and potato and topped with a roasted shallot shaved fennel salad with dill creme fraiche vinaigrette. Now, I'm a big fan of dill (everything from dill weed to dill pickles to dill popcorn -- yes, that's a thing). If you AREN'T a fan, I'd suggest you maybe pick-le something else (see what I did there). It's definitely a different, more refined approach to pierogies compared to other options I've tried locally (love me some pierogs) but superrr good. Will definitely appeal to dill-loving foodies! And while it was on the pricier end, I would definitely order it again. Yay, Market Garden!!"}
{"text":"We came here while bar hopping the Market District in Cleveland and had a rather pleasant experience. It was super busy, but we managed to score one bar stool while one of us alternated standing up waiting for one.  The bartender was very friendly and there was almost no wait for a drink, despite the crowd.  I didn't order food, although I have eaten an appetizer here once before and it was very good. The beers I had were all great. I especially liked their IPAs including the Clusterfuggle. Everything was served in clean, proper glassware. The building itself also has a nice, vintage urban feel. Lots of wood and interesting light up signs."}
{"text":"Lobster roll a must.  To bad it's only seasonal!  I got the pierogies and kielbasa so so so good"}
{"text":"The food was okay, beer was good. I got the Mac n cheese which was not what I expected, don't recommend. Overall has a cool vibe a good place for young adults"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorites in Cleveland, or more specifically, the Ohio City area. Been coming here since it opened, and I always leave very satisfied and happy. First off, their beer list is solid, as most of the places in Ohio City. The bartenders are always very friendly and helpful. I also really like the atmosphere, especially in the summer when you can enjoy their patio. I've tried many things on their menu, my favorite probably being the fried chicken, and I've always liked what I've ordered. In general, this place is just a tried and true standby for me, and I always recommend to out of towners when they ask me where to stop in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in during our whirlwind, one-evening tour of Cleveland.  It was a bit of a slow night due to some other things going on in the Ohio City neighborhood, but that was ok because it gave us a chance to really see the place.  It's huge!   We went in Winter so the back patio area was closed and covered in snow, but it looks like it would be a lot of fun in the Summer.  We didn't get any food, but did sample several beers.  Our bartender was AWESOME and gave us several recommendations and samples.  Some of the beers were better than others.  I particularly enjoyed their American style beer (forget the name and it's not my typical variety but it was good for what it was) but didn't care for their Experimental Hop beer (also forget the name....something with a triple digit number in it to identify the specific hop variety).   Overall, we really enjoyed this place and both agreed we'd like to come back when the weather improves to sample some food."}
