{"text":"Satisfying meal.  I had halibut & chips.  Very tasty and the fries were simple & straight forward good. Friendly owners.  Will definitely head back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gems.  We ordered Halibut and Cod and shared a chips.  
The fish are very juicy, I was quite surprise to have a juicy deep fried fish totally not dry.  
And they have fresh cut fries which was pretty good. 

The owner are nice and are very helpful.  

You got to try here."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving fish and chips, this place is my go-to! The halibut and chips is the one I always order and it always tastes so good. Definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were delicious and flavourful, but I can't give 5 stars to fish and chip places that give you little packets of tartar sauce. Come on guys! Step up your game. Make your own version. Sell it for an extra buck. It would set you apart."}
{"text":"The place looks like it needs to be cleaned. The fish was old, you could tell because of the smell after eating it. The price is too much for what it is, might as well bought highliner fish sticks. The fries where okay at best. Please ask Gordon Ramsay to visit this place, to clean it up."}
{"text":"Good tasting fish and chips !!!  One of the better fish and chips in Markham. Fish is always done right, and fries and onion rings are done right too. I only take out, due to small eating area inside.  4 stars - as mentioned in another review, the tarter sauce should be made in store and given out in a little container rather than packets.
I tired halibut house a few times now, i prefer windjammers fish and chips.

Lots of parking, friendly owners."}
