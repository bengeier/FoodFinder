{"text":"Hottest and best spicy chicken broccoli I ever had. Also got an egg added to it. Very good"}
{"text":"My experience was obviously very different than the other reviewers! I was so excited to learn that this place was opening in Blawnox, which hasn't seen any Asian restaurants for at least 10 years. The first time I tried to order something it was early evening on a Friday. As I approached it, a lady flew out the door, locked it, and started crossing the street to her car. I yelled \"hey, aren't you open??\" She gestured something then got in her car an left. I suspect that she was going on a delivery because she had a bag, but it was weird and turned me off.

Two nights ago, I was craving something non-Americana, so I decided to give it another try. Me and my boyfriend ordered 3 appetizers: chicken satay, fried shrimp rolls, and fresh (cold) spring rolls. The only entree we ordered was the \"Thai2go Noodles.\" The order came to $35 (!!!), and I specifically remember thinking when I was walking home with my bag \"gee, this sure doesn't FEEL like $35 worth of food!\"

And I was right. We paid $6-7 for each appetizer, but the portion size was pathetic! There were only 4 chicken satay...and they were about the size of a Bic pen. The shrimp rolls were just eh - they're basically a medium sized shrimp stretched long, rolled in some spring roll dough, then fried. Bland. And again, there were only a few of them. Neither of these appetizers was a good value! However, the fresh spring roll was good and the portion size was good, too. ASK FOR EXTRA PEANUT SAUCE. They only gave me enough for like 2 rolls.

The entree was good. Not great, but good.

Lastly, there's a sign on their counter and on their menus that if you order $30 worth of stuff, you're supposed to get some food item free (I don't recall what it is.) - of course we did NOT get that \"free\" item.

I'll probably go back at some point, but it's going to have to wait until after I've won the lottery or gotten a raise! NOT A GOOD VALUE!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food quality for cheap. One of the best lunch options in the Fox chapel area that doesn't require overspending.

Highly recommended getting the garlic pepper chicken or chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"I've been on Yelp since 2010 and this is my first review-simply because I LOVE THIS PLACE. The owner and the older man who works the front desk are so sweet and the food is GOOD. The meat is good quality, well worth the price"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food with large portions.  Tom Yum soup  and Chicken
Pad Thai are excellent!!  I'll be returning often for their fresh and nutritious food."}
{"text":"I've had a few things off of their menu (including their Spicy and Thai fried rice, Tom Kha soup) and all of them are delicious. Reasonably priced, and prepared at lightning speed, Thai2Go is quickly becoming my go-to spot for Thai food. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We tried the Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles- very tasty! Our food was ready very quickly and the service was friendly."}
