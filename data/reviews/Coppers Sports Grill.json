{"text":"Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Coppers was for a 50cent beer night. It was mayhem! So crowded that It was impossible to get a drink. I never gave a thought to this place. 

Then again I tried this place to get wings. I was told by someone who came into my work that Coppers has the best wings. Being a wing freak I had to go. My boss who is also a wing guy went with me. We are very critical with out food, being chef's and all we are super picky I guess. 

The wings were crispy, tangy and delicious! If I were to picture perfect wings this would be it! As we tried other items nothing come out as good as the wings. 

I can truly say this place lives up to the Best Wings in the North Valley!!!!

Everytime we went we never had any problems finding a seat or a crazy crowd, seems as if things died down a bit but the Karaoke nights gets annoying so watch out."}
{"text":"Oh, Coppers.
What to say about Coppers...

It's a local bar filled with college aged punks and neighbors that live nearby.  It usually gets pretty packed and they have pool tables, golden tee and karaoke on some nights. 

The food is fine.  Typical. Bar-ish. Fried. 

But every time I go, some idiot with a fake I.D. is picking a fight with another idiot with spiky hair and it just gets old. If you can't tell, I'm not the biggest fan of Coppers, but a lot of people are. So just check it out and see what you think."}
