{"text":"I attended the Cattle Battle - Yelp event at this location  I loved the sample slider with housemade buns, chilli and patty! You can certainly taste the freshness. The angus meat is awesome!  In addition, I also ordered two sides - the spicy coleslaw and onion rings. The coleslaw was TOO spicy for my mild taste buds. It was still made well and not drenched in sauce :). The onion rings were fair, not the best but just okay but I probably wouldn't get that again for $5.  I heard the mac n cheese was good but I was too full to try!  It's a little far to come out as a regular but I would definitely go back for more!  Hope this helps! -jT"}
{"text":"I attended the Cattle Battle and enjoyed the burger samples. I then ordered the Heart Attack burger very tasty and moist, nice location."}
{"text":"New owner, phone number is not working, but place is open.  Burger (skirt) cooked to perfection.  Fries are crunchy and tender- the best I've had in a long time. Good, friendly atmosphere. They bring your food to your table."}
{"text":"The owner here is right on the ball !!!    He read my review on Yelp and sent me an e-mail via Yelp to apologize.  He said the next time I come in to ask for him and he would upgrade my order to a combo at no extra charge.  WOW NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE  !!!"}
{"text":"These burgers are yummy. Loosely packed, coarsely ground, not cooked to well done or beyond (as some places do), great soft bun (not a brioche, thank goodness). Great!   The patty reminds me of the Burger's Priest patty - it was very subtlely seasoned just like the BP burger I had. I had ordered bolder flavoured condiments (pickles, onions, jalapenos) which would have added nicely to this very mildly seasoned patty, but unfortunately my dining companion ended up with my awesome toppings and I ended up with his bland lettuce and tomato which did nothing to perk up the seasoning factor on my burger. Unfortunately we only realized after we had started eating and his burger was covered in cheese (I never commit the burger crime of covering it in cheese -cheese just coats your taste buds in a fatty, waxy slick so you can't taste anything else) so we couldn't do a switcheroo and the staff were too swamped at that point anyway. I definitely want to try this burger again when they actually dress my burger as requested with my awesome toppings rather than wimpy lettuce and tomato.  Their sweet potato fries and chipotle aioli are also exceptionally good. I must say, their sweet potato fries are some of the best I've ever had. Crispy on the exterior, fluffy on the interior. Hot and not oily. Awesome. The chipotle aioli is moderately spicy and they give you a nice large amount.  They also have Boylan's, so that's another positive."}
{"text":"First time here, burger was average; bun was stale.  Toppings were fresh, fries were great especially sweet potato fries.  Gravey was a tad on the sweet side, I think it was a hint of maple syrup not my cup of tea.  Service was great."}
{"text":"3 stars because what it comes down to is this place is actually worth a visit.  Overall I wasn't very much impressed with the burger. On paper, the burger has all the elements to be awesome but just didnt work for me. It was visually very appealing though.  It was cooked \"medium\" but was somehow a bit dry and flavorless. really bland and underseasoned. The bacon had no crisp and was also bland. The skirt, while may sound good in theory, when it cools down a bit isn't really a very appetizing thing to be in a sandwich. To sum up, a pretty bland burger.  the chili was good, the fries were average. For the price you pay, they are pretty generous with the portions so maybe a sprinkling of salt is difference between being mediocre and outstanding."}
{"text":"We came here for the beginning of \"Burger Binge\" and to have a taste of the \"SHOW DOWN\" between Hole-E Burger and the opponent THE WORKS! Ding ding, opening round began with hypnotizing palate teasing of bacon and cheese encorporated into the meat itself and as the extra cheese melted and slightly browned started to win us over the overdoness of the burger patty left me disappointed that this burger could carry through into the second round, Holy -E Burger seemed to be on the ropes. Ding ding second round starts with a flavour explosion of smokey jack cheese and bacon as well as a pummling of smokey mountain bbq sauce that added that certain swaying of holy I didn't see that coming, but alas \"The Works\"  burger was also over cooked. So as one of many judges to this fight (who prefers a little pink in the middle) my vote goes to \"The Works\" burger \"Smokey Mountain\". Sorry Hole-E burger you lost this round, but looking at your menu and hearing from a number of other judges I have faith and know that you're more than capable of kicking some serious ass in the rematch! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Hole-E-Shit!!!! What a fantastic experience! I'm floored by this place inside to out, top to bottom - HOLE-E-MOLEE!!!  In the interest of time and space I am going to keep this short(er) - at least by my standards.  Location: About 10 minutes drive north of Hwy 7 @ 427, along Regional Rd 50. Not as far as some nay-sayers would have you believe. Located in a mini plaza which has an ultra modern Starbucks, HBB and a Popeyes chicken (I think we know who the star of this trio is).  Decor: Set up to be casual fast food dining. Meaning that with their wood grain table tops, urban inspired stools and lighting, cool bar with a variety of beer on tap - you can either grab your grub to go and shamefully devour it in your car OR you can feel good about having a beer or two while eating your mondo meal in style.  I had the pleasure of trying A LOT of their menu items, rather than go into foodpron sextriptions, lasting hours (I mean paragraphs) I'll list the items and my thoughts:  - Chili: Made fresh in house, great full flavour, more of a tex-mex style. Mild in flavour so it's good for everyone - I would have loved the opportunity to kick it up a notch with some spice (I likes my chili firey)  - Deep Fried Pickle Spears: Standard, well cooked, great size however - larger than the average portion/service size. Chipotle and garlic aoli were wonderful!  - Warm Quinoa Salad: Served with goats cheese, piri pri - a delicous warm, healthy side alternative to the fries. I'm making this at home FOR SURE!  - Sweet Potato Fries: Steak cut (wide and long) perfectly cooked, not droopy or mushy as can happen often. Well seasoned, great crisp and texture. THE BEST SWEET POTATO FRIES in GTA  - Poutine: They claim they make the best and would put it against ANY poutine in Toronto/GTA. Gotta agree. That gravy, the cheese curds and those fries were all on point. This is a claim many make - but this poutine is a bloody art-form. Each layer masterfully prepared  - Greek Salad: Served in a skillet, well layered, all ingredients super fresh, big chunks of cucumber, peppers, onion, black olives. A great dish  - Baked Mac N' Cheese: I said it in store... and I'll say it here \"Sex in a pan.\" Given the choice between sleeping with a Playboy centerfold and this dish, this dish wins 9 times out of 10. Maybe even 10/10. Like it's kind of weird how this dish made me feel all squirrley after just one bite. Mouthwatering amazing! Baked in a skillet with a healthy layer of bacon on top, tons of thick cheese sauce and perfect cooked macaroni  Last but not least, the reason for my visit, the burgers. HBB is known for their skirt burger (a burger made with a crispy melted cheese skirt as a topping, but they also do a monthly burger special and this month the special was too good to avoid - The heart attack burger. Made with more meat than you can shake a stick at, my first quadruple bypass encourages you to visit them to try this manginicent mound of meat-a-tarian mastery.  Pfft - so much for keeping it short. Bottom line - ya gotta try this place.   Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"After after telling my meniscus I'll be in Hills cross-country ski conservation area we stopped by this nifty burger joint to lift our spirits but all we got was a period. Booger that caused a grand mal seizure and much disappointment. The coloring contest we spent much time comforting ourselves with was out of date and the bathrooms left something to be desired. The bun was too crunchy and our spirits will left wet and soggy like the fries. The cashier made my glutton intolerance a major issue and she was a real c witch! I will never go to Bolton again!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere as I walked in. Was greeted by a friendly worker.  Prices are good for what you get and they have BEER!  Wait time was good. They even brought the food to us.  Food was amazing I had the skirt burger with lettuce and caramelized onions. Make sure you get the burger done medium well.  Juicy and tasty and fries were good and spiced. Had poutine too it was different but really good no fry didn't have cheese and gravy on it.  Seats are comfortable.  Overall great place for a decent price and a amazing taste!"}
{"text":"1st time visit and was slightly disappointed. The choices seemed quite appealing and I decided on the nacho burger. The bun was fresh but the patty was very dry and tasted like it was frozen which they claim it isn't. It was terribly messy which I think was from the chili in the burger but I didn't mind that part. The highlight was the fries. They were homecut and very hot when they came out but the side of gravy I ordered was very odd. It didn't seem like beef gravy and had a strange flavor-almost buttery. I don't think I would go back but am glad to have given it a go."}
{"text":"Came in today to quickly grab a bite to eat while I was on the road. Very impressed with their Mac & Cheese, it was pure oooey gooey cheesy goodness. Crusted cheese on top with bacon, bacon, bacon. Didn't get a chance to try to the burger, but I anticipate coming back very soon to try. Loved the shabby chic decor and chill vibe. Wooden slabs used to hang the lights over the wooden slabed tables, washrooms had pretty chandeliers and the place was spic and span. Might I add that they serve beer?? they've even got a little bar area. C'mon now, who doesn't love burgers and beers?? Can't wait to come back and try out the burgers and fries!!"}
{"text":"Put holes in a burger, and guess what? You get a bone dry burger. I have no idea why people are so enthusiastic about this place. Good beef, poorly prepared.  The staff were pleasant and the space was alright.  Before I went there, I checked out their website and there was the flashing red light: A fast food joint that won't show it's prices upfront. Yup, overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"Not sure if I caught this place on a bad day seeing as it has amazing reviews.  If I didn't then i'm not to sure what the hype is.  Burger had no taste and was served on a whole wheat bun which by looking at some of the pictures posted I don't see 1 whole wheat bun being used. The poutine was decent but was a little dry and the gravy was very salty.  Wont go out of my way to go back there but I am willing to give it a second chance seeing as it has many great reviews.  I will give a second review when I visit again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The owner and staff are so enthusiastic about their business and it is really refreshing to see.  It makes you feel relaxed and comfortable.   As for the food, I had a Hole-E-Skirt burger with fries. The beef was made with angus meat and cooked to perfection, but what really added flavour was the applewood smoked bacon. It really went well with the beef.  My only minor complaint would be that the bottom of the burger was too hot.  I had a bit of a problem picking it up and had to wait for it to cool.  Ah well, minor inconvenience for an awesome burger.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Attended the cattle Battle at hole-e burger and it was amazing. Hole-e burgers buns are beyond amazing. The patty was juicy and flavourful and the cheese with applewood smoked bacon put it over the top. Even though it was just a sampler, it blew me out the water. If I worked here I would be incredibly fat. I would make the trek here just to eat the burger."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Fires were under cooked and the burger was tasteless. Won't be back here any time soon"}
{"text":"Hole E Burger Bar...soo good on so many levels...awesome tasting burgers, flat top grilled, everything made on site..The first time I ate here was during Yelps Burger Bash and I guess I should have gotten around to this earlier.  This is where it all started..my introduction to Yelp and awesomeness of Hole E Burger bar.    If your  from Ontario you might remember a commercial saying \"its worth the drive to Acton\" I think that Hole E Burger bar should adopt said commercial and say \"its worth the drive to Bolton\".  A trendy restaurant with great decor, Hole E is located right on Hwy 50.  Your burger journey can either begin with a pre-selected combination or you can choose your own adventure by selecting your own custom toppings and patties. I opted for the Hole E Nacho burger with a combo of fries and drink.  Homemade Chili, cheese, Jalapenos and more cheese...soo tasty!!  The one thing that I love is a burger cooked on a flattop grill.  Not to say char broiling on a grill is bad...but nothing IMHO beats the taste of a fried burger.  Hole E burger kicks it up a notch by not just putting cheese on your burger..but a melted skirt of fried cheese that you can only get by using a flattop grill, in one word...EPIC..Everything from what I was told is all done in house (not to sure of the buns) Hole E burger bar is also fully licenced and in the summer has a patio.  If your north of the GTA or east of Brampton..and you love burgers...go to the place where the burgers have Holes!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in today as I was driving through and was impressed.   Had great service from the manager and cook who went out of their way to make sure we were happy and the burger was Excellent.  Definitely recommend this spot and will stop again next time I'm in Bolton."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. A little pricey but I'd rather go here than to any fast food chain."}
{"text":"Hole E Burger is freakin' awesome. The owner and chef are very nice and the food is amazing! I've never had a better mac and cheese! I've tried the Hole E Skirt Burger and the Greek Burger. Both were fantastic. The Hole E Skirt burger is my fave and that will be my regular order from now on. I was so excited, I brought the whole family here. Their milkshakes -to die for. My niece would agree. Also a special treat: their cookie ice cream sandwich LOADED with sprinkles. My niece took the liberty of licking all the ice cream off one side. So ya, she liked it. I tried one before and loved it too. My dad loved that they had beer and wine here! My mom loved the healthy options. I'm a fan of their Greek salad. Their sweet potato fries are the best I've had at restaurant. Ever! Their poutine was also out of this world. One thing is guaranteed: when you go here, you will leave STUFFED! I absolutely cannot wait to go again and again."}
{"text":"Yup, Hole E Burger has gotten a bump up. That Heart Attack burger was amazing, the beef patty, with pulled pork dripping in BBQ sauce. The patty so fresh the juices shot out when I took my first bite. I also like the atmosphere of this place, some places try to cram in as many seats as possible, here there is enough seating and comfort.   The sliders are a perfect size for my girls and fresh. Topped with apple wood smoked bacon, yum.   Have yet to try the poutine. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! couldn't wait.  Had to reinstall app so this is all that's left. ... yum! Extensive menu of awesomeness. Tasty beef patty and lots of fun burgers to choose from. I had the mac and cheese burger."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place out with the Burger Brigade last night, and it was worth the wait.  Excellent service from the staff, making sure that we were satisfied and very friendly. Nice seating areas as well.   I tried the homemade chili (very nice, more of a tex-mex type of chili), sweet potato fries, poutine, mac & cheese, and quinoa veggie salad. I especially enjoyed the quinoa salad - I haven't had quinoa a lot but this gave me a good idea of how to make it at home! It's rare that a burger joint has truly 'healthy' fare so I was impressed.  For the burger, I tried the Hole-E Skirt burger and the greek burger. These are massive burgers so make sure you come with a big appetite!! I loved the cheese skirt but I think over all I enjoyed the Greek burger better...it was really good!   We finished off with a cookie ice cream sandwich and vanilla milkshake....I barely had room for anything else but I had to try both and neither disappointed. In fact, I'm still full this morning! haha. :) Worth the drive to Bolton, but don't despair...they are opening a location in Toronto in the spring!"}
{"text":"Came again yesterday. Owner is a very nice and appreciative guy.   The burger this time was significantly better than last time.  It's a good solid burger.  My only issue was the bacon being a little rubbery. Also the fries are a little greasy  but theyre pretty fresh.  Would still comeback forsure."}
{"text":"This was one of the most interesting restaurant experiences I've ever had, so I'm going to dive right into my story to explain.  My brother-in-law and I are big burger fans. We regularly scope out the best burger joints in the GTA to appease our carnivorous appetite. Two weeks ago we decided to give a local place a try and ended up taking his vegetarian sister (my wife) along for the trip.   When we arrived there were two people working (one front staff member, one cook). We ordered two burgers, Mac n cheese and Nonna's fries plus two waters. We carefully chose our seats and quickly gathered some condiments as we excitedly waited for our meat.   About ten minutes later, two cokes were brought over to us which of course we turned back because we ordered waters. We also watched as the waitress bring an incorrect order to the table next to us. As the tension built, the waitress informed us that they couldn't make Mac n cheese. We quickly substituted this dish for an order if poutine which we were reluctant to do since we already ordered Nonna's garlic fries. The burgers arrived and they were good, but I've had better. To give you some perspective it's a notch below \"The Works.\" We still enjoyed it but are slowly as we waited for our fries.   After eating half my burger, fries arrived but they were neither garlic fries nor a poutine. Meanwhile the table next to us (who ordered before us) was still waiting for his burgers.   Finally both orders of fries arrive. We frantically eat away whispering about the odd experience we just had. However, the 'chef' then comes out, humble and extremely sad, and slowly apologizes for our experience. Turns out his chef did not show up this morning so they were ver understaffed. I've never seen this in a manager owner before but it takes a lot if courage. It shows the character that they have. I will be back on another day to take another stab at it."}
{"text":"Burgers are juicy.  Quite a bit of variety in burger options too.  They do take a few minutes though as they cook them fresh.   But if you dine in they will bring your order to you  Very friendly staff; I think they checked on us 3 times if we needed refills.    I tried the meat and potatoes burger.   Next time I will try the heart attack.  I find the ordering a bit flawed though. They didnt seem to communicate some of the specials very well.   iE- website lists burgers of the day but did not see that in store.  Plus there was a chalkboard that read specials. ...... but then there was a Corona fridge blocking the rest of the board so you couldn't read it."}
{"text":"Wanted a light lunch so I just built a burger. I got a beef burger with goat cheese, lettuce, tomato, bacon and roasted garlic aioli. Kind of like Smash Burger back home where you order at the register then they send the food at your table. Seems to be new place. The guy who took my order was still trying to get used to the register, but he was really nice and was personable. I only wish they can cook burgers medium in Canada."}
{"text":"Ok, we called ahead but was told the number is disconnected! Drove there to check it out and was pleasantly surprised it was open. New owner has taken over the Hole, he's working on getting the number up again so that should be fixed soon. I ordered the Heart Attack burger, small poutine and chili fries. The burger seemed small but it had heft to it! was packed with meat and pulled pork, it was more than enough! the poutine was classic and they used curd cheese, no issue here. Chili fries had a bite to them and was loaded with beef chili, good stuff and worth trying if you can stand the bite. A winner here and worth the drive to Bolton!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with decor inside. I was greeted friendly upon entering by the owner and his waitress or wife.  My Order:  SKIRT BUTGER = TO Much Salt CHEESE POUTINE= Average fries with shredded mozzarella, not melted. Kids didn't like it.  BACON POUTINE= No Flavour, despite there was a lot of toppings, melted cheese, bacon,onions,etc. 2 Cokes = unlimited refills.   Overall it was a very overpriced for 1 burger, 2 poutines, 2 cokes, + 15% tip = $38.58  Don't mind the pricey food, but wasn't good. I am giving 2 stars for the nice decor, nice greeting, and they did try their best as it did look fresh and their was a 10 min wait."}
