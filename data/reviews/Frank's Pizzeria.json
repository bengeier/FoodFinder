{"text":"It tastes like frozen pizza! Sweet sauce and little cheese."}
{"text":"Okay -- I am incredibly picky about red sauce / pizza sauce.  I never like anyone's sauce because most people just don't know what they are doing when they season it.  It either has too much spices or it tastes like plain tomato sauce.  Well - not at Franks!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was AMAZIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!!!!  I have had a lot of different pizza places in the Pittsburgh area and I never really like them for one reason or another and don't ever go back.  I will be going back to Frank's Pizzeria....a LOT!!!  The outside of the place is so unassuming.  But you go inside and it is very tiny and there are a bunch of guys making pizza -- but they know what they are doing.  Its super cheap (Just under $11 for a 1 topping 14 inch pizza).  They do only accept cash - so be ready for that.  The pepperoni on the pizza was thick slices - which was really nice to see - it really added to the flavor of the pizza.  In my opinion ---- EVERYONE must try this place!!!!  I would have given 5 stars except it was alittle annoying they didn't accept debit card and there isn't much cheese on the pizza.  So......if you like cheese -- be sure one of your toppings is EXTRA CHEESE.  Other than that -- NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best tasting pizza I've ever eaten.  This is the only place I've ever been shut-out of because they'd already taken a night's full of orders by 7PM!  I could very well live off their pies.  I have lived all over the United States, and currently reside in Seattle, but Frank's has never been topped by anyone.  No, this is not my hometown pizza joint.  Heck, it wasn't even my local place in college.  I've always had to drive at least thirty minutes for Franks, and it has always been worth it.  Once, they were temporarily unable to procure their normal brand of pepperoni.  They were up-front about it, saying that they couldn't get it, but that they'd found another variety which was close.  They even told me that if I was completely dissatisfied, they'd make it right.  I told them I trusted them, and I wasn't disappointed.  Frank's does one brilliant thing I've really never seen before at any pizza restaurant: Most toppings go on fresh after baking.  Pepperonis are nice and soft, and flavorful, without being browned, curled into a little grease cup, or crisped into a blackened charcoal-tasting nastiness.  It's just amazing.  The last time I went in, I noticed someone was missing.  I learned that Frank Aloe, the namesake of the best pizza place in the country, had passed away in May of 2010 at the age of 82.  I'm sure he's sorely missed by his family of pizza makers (three generations of them work nightly in the restaurant,) but I'll also miss him.  He crafted a masterpiece, and I consider myself lucky to have known him and his pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good. Service is slower than I'd like. Lady at the front adding toppings was wiping her hands on her smock and fixing her hair, and sneezing and wiping her nose without washing her hands and handling the food. This grossed me out."}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a pizza expert. I try \"the best\" pizza everywhere I go, doing a lot of research online. Frank's pizza in Ambridge is better than pizza I've had in New York or San Fran, or anywhere! It's unique sweet sauce is what makes all the difference in my opinion. The crust is always perfect. And all the other ingredients are a fresh, good quality. I've had people request I bring them a Frank's pizza - even carrying an unbaked one as my carry on. There's no competition in my opinion to other pizza places."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've ever eaten! Every time I eat pizza at a new joint I compare it to Frank's. I've been going to Frank's since high school. I moved out of town almost 14 years ago, but make sure I stop and grab a pie when I'm in town. My mouth is watering as I type."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had hands down!  I grew up nearby and always enjoyed their pizza. I left for years and always tried to plan a trip to get some pizza when in town.  I've had pizza from all over including NYC and Chicago and still love my Franks! Now that I've moved back to the area it has become the family favorite!  Perfect , fresh, thin crust, great sauce with just the right seasoning and the cheese.. So fresh and under the sauce of course! Always try to call when they open to order since the waits will be, even then, 45-90 mins. Heart shaped pizzas are great too and hit up the ATM beforehand.. Cash only!"}
{"text":"YALL NEED TO TRY THIS PIZZA.   It's seriously out of this world.   The sauce is sweet and rich (also on top with the cheese underneath) and by far one of the best sauces in my opinion around this area. It's one size pizza for about 9-10 bucks. I haven't tried anything else on the menu but the pizza is please go try."}
{"text":"Frank's Pizzeria continues to deliver a top quality homemade pizza at a very reasonable cost.  Frank's Pizza is made with love.  The sauce on top of the cheese is the icing on the cake.  Thick cut pepperoni only adds to the awesome flavor.  The crust is crispy yet so soft on the inside.   Simple ingredients made into a flavorful pie.  Toppings are not baked on unless requested.  Frank's is a weekly staple in our house."}
{"text":"this might be the worst pizza Ive ever had. the toppings clearly come from a can. yuck. the crust was decnt and thats the only nice thing I have to say. sorry folks, I cant understand why you like this place. the sauce isnt good, the toppings suck (except for the pepperoni), and the cheese? I think was mostly made of plastic. thanks, but no thanks. I guess I have to drive to the city for decent pie."}
{"text":"Frank's Pizza is the BEST PIZZA on the Continent !!   I've been all over America, and the crust, cheese and sauce combination here can't be beat !!!   Everything is hand made and tossed up in the air LIVE  !!!!!!     What comes down is a taste that is out of this world !!     This family pizza joint has tons of experience making and fine tuning the incredible TASTE of their PIZZA !!   Enjoy !!!"}
{"text":"Frank's is one of the BEST pizza places in the city!!! Definitely top 3!!!  The wait times can sometimes be long.. An hour is average.. But it's definitely worth the wait for delicious, fresh baked pizza. It doesn't even compare to other places in the area!!!"}
{"text":"I agree!!! BEST Pizza ever!!! Love the white Pizza with olives!!!!.  Each Friday has become religiously my treat!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. There are a lot of so called pizza places in pgh, (throat clearing) mineos that just don't deliver; both literally and figuratively. It's a drive out to franks, or not if you live north of the city, but well worth the trek. Allow yourself at least 45 minutes from the time your order until you pick it up as franks has very long wait times. Don't be surprised if you call them and they say that your pizza will be ready in 90 minutes. Don't fret, each minute that passes will just bring you one minute closer to a divine pizza experience. They are family owned and only have one size pizza, though you can get a heart shaped guy if that's your thing. Also the cheese is cooked underneath the sauce at franks with the toppings on top of the sauce....mmmmm  If you weren't already convinced of franks absolute goodness, hear this. Franks actually got me out of a speeding ticket. I was on my way, driving a little faster than I should have when the red and blue lights pierced my eyes in the rear view mirror. The office asked where I was headed, I told him franks. With a smile on his face, the officer replied that if he wrote me a ticket that my pizza would get cold and said oh man, franks is the pizza in the city. He handed me back my license and said drive safe and enjoy my pie. Thanks franks!  Do yourself a major favor and get some franks today!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best pizza I have ever eaten was from this humble little hole in the wall in Ambridge, PA. Although the town has little left to offer in and of itself, this pizza place (along with Pizza House off Merchant St) really makes the trek worth it in my opinion. I used to go here time after time again since my grade school years.  For anyone interested in giving Frank's Pizzeria a shot, you'll want to be sure to call your order in ahead of time if you want to shorten your time waiting in line for a delicious pizza. The menu is simple enough, with only one size of pizza and no additional gimmicky add-on ingredients. I always go for the plain pizza myself, but the pepperoni is also a smash hit. The calzone and the iconic heart shaped pizza (for the love of your life of course) are also excellent choices.  Really sucks that I live in California these days. I just can't find any good pizza out here and have been sufficiently spoiled by Frank's Pizzeria. Fortunately, I do hear that they can pack their pizzas uncooked for shipping. I might have to have my family send one my way."}
{"text":"Such amazing pizza..sometimes you have to wait hours and it's so worth it. They put cheese under the sauce, and I always get extra cheese, which they put on top. Make sure you call and order ahead and time your arrival."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic! This little family owned joint has the best pizza in the burgh! At first I was a little hesitant to try sauce on top especially since I am not much of a red sauce fan typically. I was immediately hooked after having one bite! I crave franks pizza regularly! Its that unique and delicious flavor that keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's as good as everyone says. Yes, the sauce is on top. Yes, the pepperoni is amazing (it's the only topping I ever get).  It's hard to find a family as nice as the Aloe family. They have been an Ambridge institution for decades (for more than just pizza), and to have them serve up this amazing pizza that has been virtually unchanged through the years--well, you just don't get that in most places.  Call ahead, especially on the weekends. People come from all over the area for a pie. Bring cash. Maybe get 2 pies, since I tend to eat half of it in the car on the way home.  Living in the city for the past 9 years or so, I can't find very many pizza places that can hold a candle to the two Ambridge pizza titans (Franks & Police Station). It's definitely a fortunate place to be if you've got a craving for pizza.  Also a very unfortunate place to be if you have that craving on a Sunday (WHICH HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Pizza unlike any other.  I lived in Ambridge for a number of years and went to Frank's as often as I could.  Family owned and operated for over 40 years, it is really incredible.  Good people, good pizza.  Call ahead the night before for quicker service as they do get very busy with the short time they are open.  Always worth the wait, however."}
{"text":"Best pizza around in my opinion. The pepperoni is great!  My husband and I debate on which is better, police station pizza or Franks. Franks to me is the best hands down!"}
{"text":"Like I've stated in many reviews before. My wife and I are pizza snobs. We try pizza all over the place and have done so for nearly 25 years. This is my number one pizza ever. Yes, we've ate Pizza House and Mineos but this is clearly better. The pizza is made upside down. This means the cheese is under the sauce. If you google this, all the great pizza places do this. It allows the sauce to hit your taste buds first. And believe me. You want this. Their sauce is amazing. All of their toppings are top notch. Thick pepperoni. Not those little cheap greasy disks. REAL pepperoni. The cheese is so good and the crust. Just go there. Don't walk. RUN. You'll thank me. Seriously."}
{"text":"This is some great pizza. Sauce on top so can be messy. The pepperoni is great and the Stromboli's are awesome also. Great prices. Not a huge amount of toppings but the pizza and sauce are awesome.  If you never tried Franks I would highly suggest picking some up. I would call in advance though because the wait is usually pretty long.  Nothing else to say but don't die without trying this pizza."}
{"text":"Genuinely one of the finest pies around. Make the trip to Ambridge to sample a slice. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza ever. We get it about once a week, and every single time it is delicious and looks beautiful. It's not greasy, and you don't feel gross after eating more than you should. The freshest pizza around! By far the most consistent place I've been to. I can't recommend it enough!!! Just be cautious about the wait times - on busy evenings, it can be well over an hour.  This holds a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but could you PLEASE open before 6pm...that is just INSANE!!!!! Even 4pm...people with kids eat dinner before 6pm."}
{"text":"\"You gotta go to Frank's\".  \"Frank's is the best pizza ever\".  \"Frank's won top honor's in another pizza contest.  I'm telling you, Frank's is the best\".  Okay, after hearing this about a hundred times, I decided to try Frank's.  I mean, Ambridge isn't far from where I live.  But Ambridge also isn't exactly the most exciting destination.  So after reading the \"history\" of Frank's on their website, we knew had to go.  We love those old time businesses and delight in the stories of how they were hatched.  We decided to try them on a recent Monday night.  Apparently call ins are advised of a 45 minute pizza, while walk in's are 15-20 minutes.  We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza.  While we waiting, it was fun to watch the family work in the kitchen.  Father, two daughter and grandma.  And talk about busy!  There was a steady trail of customers in and out the door the entire time we were there.   I wanted to try the pizza the minute we got in the car.  But it was much too hot.  I had to wait until we got back to Cranberry.  It was worth the wait!   The crust is amazing.  So soft, yet crispy on the outside.  I can't say enough good about that crust.  It could only be better if it was whole wheat.  The sauce is awesome.  This is the kind of pizza that I call wet pizza.  The sauce is still liquid even after the pizza is cooked.  The pepperoni is thick and yummy.  This pizza is definitely one of the best!"}
{"text":"We drove 40 minutes to Frank's on the recommendation of a friend. Good pizza is scarce in Pittsburgh and great pizza is nearly impossible to find...until now!  Frank's pizza is old school - hand made crust and homemade sauce. Let's start with the crust. The crust is amazing. It reminds me of good Italian bread  - crusty and crunchy on the outside, but tender and chewy on the inside. The crust is then topped with mozzarella cheese and then with sauce. The sauce is smooth, slightly sweet, and not overly seasoned. Once baked, the pizza is topped with a sprinkle of oregano and parmesan cheese. If you order toppings, this is also when they go on. The pepperoni is cut thick and is full of flavor and a little zesty.   I think this has become my favorite pizza - if only it weren't so far away!"}
