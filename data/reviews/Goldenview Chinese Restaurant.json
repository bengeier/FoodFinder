{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering from this place they call a restaurant. I was in mood for some good hearty Chinese and decided to order from goldenview through justeat. BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF MY LIFE. First of all, I thought is standard gravy dishes are accompanied by steamed rice, but I was wrong. I was charged $3 for a bowl of rice. The food arrived before time, I have to give them that. But theres a reason behind why it arrived on time, its because there was hardly anything freshly prepared. The ginger beef with pineapple is a nasty mix of onions in watery sauce with huge pieces of ginger and canned pineapple that is most likely expired. That is honestly what it tasted like. I do not like to bash restaurants but the food provided by Goldenview does not qualify to be called food. The shrimp in black bean sauce was another disappointment. Huge pieces of green peppers and carrots hid the tiny 6 pieces of shrimp in the entire dish. I was promised 12 on their website. I would suggest you all save your money and order elsewhere. There are plenty of other good Chinese restaurants that have amazing food. NEVER EVER ORDERING AGAIN FROM HERE."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Mississauga hands down. 
Friendly staff, fast delivery, - this is our go to restaurant for take out!!"}
{"text":"Got Delivery tonight and it wasn't too bad didn't like the egg roll or beef and broccoli as it had a fishy taste only had 4 slices of beef and 8 pieces of brocolli alot of rice and then I got sweet and sour chicken balls instead of ribs for my combo plate and I paid $1 extra they were better then the beef and brocolli and they give just 4 of them already coated in sauce so soggy when they got here. My husband also got a combo plate with fried shrimp(4),egg roll, chicken chow mein and rice he hasn't ate yet but his didn't look to bad. I ordered a can of soda also but it was in bag with hot food so it was hot by time it got here. Whole order was cheap $30 with tip and taxes free delivery over $20 so that's good and driver was nice so that's why 4stars would rather have fave 3 1/2 stars though."}
{"text":"Toughie, this...How many stars, and what kind of review.  With only two other reviews (one paid, possibly, and the other, borderline nonsensical - SORRY!), I feel like I'm playing God with the future of a business I hardly know, and thereby the lives of folks unknown.  But what of my call of duty as a Yelper?

If I may, I'll just tell it like it is: facts over fancy frivolous frothing of the mouth/pen/keyboard.

We're in town on a somber note anyway: next Wednesday marks 10 years after Dad left us, and even as we continue to celebrate his life, there's no hiding the sad tears, past and present: tears from missing a man I love and admire, my only superhero.  

Our desire, having checked into town (into a very nice Hilton in Missisauga), was to just rest up:, i.e., not wander too far afield, not get too fancy.  Yelp helped me locate something half a mile away; 3 stars on 2 reviews means only one thing... Do I gotta do it myself?

Upon entry, my suspicion (based on reading the 'nonsensical' review) was correct: this isn't a 'Chinese restaurant' as much as a Chinese take-out.  There are 4x4 plus 2x2 tables, but the prominent display of two huge red pizza-delivery-type warmers sitting on one of the tables tells me that they do indeed live by pick-up and delivery.  Still, don't judge them by THAT, right? Ya gotta do what ya gotta do to stay alive.  Who's to say they don't have a budding (Chinese) Bocuse hiding in that kitchen, Paul?

Dream on.  

Taking a look through their 'regular' menu sent me quickly to the 'specialty' section - these are pricier, and I'd hoped, better selections. 

Here's the blow-by-blow.

ROYAL MIX PLATE ($14.99) This is your 'standard' seafood stir-fry, and decidedly the better dish.  Scallops were good-sized, plentiful, and fresh-/sweet-tasting.  Shrimps were almost as good: 21-26, I'd say, and 5-6 in number, just like those lovely scallops.  Only knock is that the shrimps weren't de-veined.  Chicken chunks and slices of char siu (Chinese BBQ pork) also filled the space, but they didn't do the dish any favors.  The char siu did not taste daisy-fresh, and the chicken is more for the taste of North American palates.  We Chinese leave the white meat to all the kids until their taste-buds knew better (and even then): the favored parts are the dark meats of legs and thighs.  As well, we'd never really do a stir-fry unless we first coat meats with a combo of oil, soy (or fish sauce, or other such sauces), and corn starch.  This coats the meat and gives it the silky texture that we call 'smooth'.  They didn't do that here.  Accompanying were some bok choy, slices of carrots, under-cooked onions and virtually uncooked mushrooms, and a few sprigs of snow peas: a bit of a mish-mash, you might say.

BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH SNOW PEAS ($17.99)  As the most expensive item on the menu, this one set high expectations.  Still, having been 'burnt' by claims of 'beef tenderloin' turning out to be tenderized unidentified cuts, I verified that this is, indeed, beef tenderloin.  It turned out to be two slices of what LOOKS like beef tenderloin, with a hint of a beefy taste, but the meat was chewy for tenderloin, and not all of it could be blamed on over-cooking.  I joked that this steer was a body builder that fortified its innermost loins with vigorous daily exercise routines.  Man, this guy worked HARD in his lifetime!  The accompanying vegetables were almost the same as the first dish, with perhaps a few more snow peas.  AGAIN, the onions and mushrooms are barely cooked.  Such a shame.  Have these guys tasted what sliced or diced mushrooms in a hot wok with the proper seasoning can be like?  A lost opportunity, for sure.  Unlike 'regular' NA Chinese restaurants, rice is extra at $2.45 for a portion that's good for two.

If I owned Goldenview, or any restaurant, I'd prepare food that folks can't WAIT to come back to savor, or else I don't know that I want to be running a restaurant.  Yes: many a fortune has been made on mediocre and undistinguished fare.  Those are businessmen/women.  If you take PRIDE in your food, you've got to aim higher.

At which point, I'm reminded by the morality tale in a movie called Big Night (Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub, Isabella Rossellini).

Sad but true."}
{"text":"I drove by this place a few times. Looks very nice and small. Was looking forward on dicovering a hidden gem. While I was taking my time to order I noticed the other tables by me were eating a little than asking to take the food to go after they only touched it a little, I still ordered these people must have been in a rush, I thought. Recieved my food and notice the portions were quite small for a Chinese place. Than I had a bite of the three different dishes and realized why people beside us were asking to take the food to go and not staying in to eat. They were packing to through it in the garbage for sure. Recall one of the plates was called the chefs special and it tasted like someone's barf or a combination of people's left overs. By far this is the worst Chinese food I have had. I was with a friend and he  thought the same. I have been to a lot of chinese restaurants but none ever tasted like this."}
