{"text":"Moved into the area just a couple months ago and have to say these are simply the best sandwiches I can remember.  Corned beef, the cuban, gyros, ruebans....all fantastic.
Another reviewer said they didn't use gloves in their post.  I have been to the store many times in the last 3 months.  Every single time my sandwiches were made, gloves were always used.  
Royalwood deli is our default place for a lunch to go or even a quick dinner when we are getting home late."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Amazing reuben sandwiches!!!! Enough to feed two people (or one if you're feeling greedy). The pickles are the best I've ever had, as well as the baklava."}
{"text":"Do not get food from this place. I walk in and the guy who was just taking people's money walks down to the food counter and starts handling my order...without gloves. Then he pulls the gyro meat out of the fridge and microwaves it. Then of course goes to take some more people's money. Comes back (still no gloves) to finish the gyro. Basic hygiene practices aren't followed. Go elsewhere for food"}
