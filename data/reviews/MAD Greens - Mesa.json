{"text":"I'm so disappointed that this is my first one star review. I've tried this place three times. Three times. And not one time has the experience been above mediocre.

The staff is completely clueless; they have not been trained on menu knowledge, not that I cared much about that, but the guy behind me in line had a few questions about a salad. He asked what was in a certain salad, the employee didn't know, so she grabbed another employee who also said \"I don't know\" then left it at that.

We ordered two juices--my husbands was good, but mine ended up being super...sludgie? If that's the word? Thick like molasses, it was pretty gross. :(

The wait times are atrocious, from what I can see it's due to disorganization and a confused staff; during my first visit, my husbands food came out first and I waited about 10 minutes for mine. Why doesn't food come out together? This last experience I waited a good 15 minutes for my food again (I guess the Annie Oakley must take longer to make?) a staff member walked by my table twice, and outside, and to the back with my food. I had to go back to the front to inquire about the food because it looked like my sandwich, so they gave it to me... And I gave them back my number, which was on my table... In fact, when an employee came to deliver our juices, he tried to take the number. My husband was about halfway done with his meal and I kindly told him that I was still waiting on my food. He said \"oh,\" and walked away. 

My advice to this new location:

-Train your employees!
-Hire for soft skills - train for hard skills. It seems you hire at random and do not train at all.

The ambiance is nice, the restaurant is clean, the food is good (when the employees don't mess it up). This has the potential to be a great brand, but the service I experienced ruined my opinion of this brand and I will likely never go to another one. :("}
{"text":"I've gotten juices here and they are always so good! The apple greenie is my fave, but in the summer you can't beat the strawberry cooler. If you check out their website, it has pics of all their food- perfect for making healthy decisions!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch.

I suggest going in around 11:30 am or 1 pm to avoid the lunch rush.

My favorite salad is the TY Cobb with spicy avocado!

This place is kind of costly for a salad but it CAN be worth it assuming the taste and preparation are on point. 

First time amazing!
Second time- no flavor , odd but didn't taste any ingredients.
Today- WAY TOO MUCH dressing. On a good note, taste was there :)

Your light dressing could mean something else to the preparer. Be sure to be very articulate when you ask for LIGHT dressing. 

I will go back again"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh ingredients, taking salads to another level! The spicy pumpkin seeds definitely have a kick! The staff was knowledgeable about ingredients in dressings etc. Whole 30 friendly! I will be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I love this place. Went there the first time and had the modt delicious salad! So fresh and the restaurant itself is stylish and clean."}
{"text":"Love the salad, although pricey. But the service is CONSISTENTLY bad. I've waited to be noticed standing at the counter multiple times.  No one looks. No one acknowledges my presence. Then, once noticed, there are no apologies or acknowledgements. I alter the salad very slightly but it gets messed up ALMOST EVERY TIME. once, they put The Wrong Dressing on a standard salad. No apologies or acknowledgements. It also looks like the employees hate their jobs. 

Management: this is a systems/management issue.  In my many visits (you have me hooked on one salad and I will splurge every so often) one of my above complaints ALWAYS happens. Have a system to notice customers.  Train them well. Have them ask/verify changes to standard orders. And have them at least pretend they like what they do."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Nothing better then a nice cold salad on a hot summer day. The staff are super friendly too"}
{"text":"I am a Colorado native so I'm already in love with MAD Greens. The Ty Cobb is my favorite and I love the amount of food I get for the price I pay. However, my salad was lacking the packed to the top appeal I so love. Hopefully next time I get the food for the price I pay!"}
{"text":"Love the newly opened Mad Greens in Mesa, AZ, for the salads. Sadly, my husband, on his first visit, ordered the Annie Oakley Paninni sandwich. No sides came with it and the whole thing was flatter, than my iPhone. Hence, I will recommend Mad Greens, for the salads, but steer clear of a Paninni. 9+ bucks for a few ounces is not worth it."}
{"text":"Healthy Greens is a great for food quality, selection and service. Otherwise a 5 star establishment, except for off peak hours when it is sometimes under staffed. The only two staff members here at 7:30 have been working hard to fill my family's order and the orders of the 3 families behind us. Having a a third employee would probably cut our 20 min and counting order by half and also bump this to a 5 star review. Love the food now Beet It!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch today, love your salads but waited an extremely long time for my salad and then when I finally got it I had to remind them at the end to put avocado in my salad (Ty Cobb) and then I get home to eat it and it has no chicken. I don't mind paying $10+ for a salad but then to have no meat on it was a huge disappointment. I drive out of my way to get salads from this restaurant. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm kind of baffled by this place. I've visited three times now. The service quality has been different every time, and the food has been underwhelming every time. 

First visit -- got the Siam I Am salad. It was okay. The kale and quinoa in it overpowered everything else and gave it a really bland flavor. I visited just after it opened and it was pretty empty. Service was good but nothing special.

Second visit -- ordered a hummus trio to go. Nothing else. I didn't wait in a line at all and it still took them 20 minutes to get it ready for me. It tasted fine. The spicy avocado was good (surprisingly spicy!), the roasted garlic was actually pretty bland (tasted like plain hummus to me), and the beet (which I was most excited for) tasted like dirt.

Third visit -- got a Bollywood wrap. Visited during a busy lunch hour and the employees were all cranky except for the cashier at the end. Got through a decent line pretty quickly and my food was made quickly. I was expecting a nice, flavorful chicken salad and...I didn't get it. Only flavor I could taste was cumin. There was like, one hunk of chicken in the whole wrap and tons of lettuce. I didn't finish it.

They've got such yummy sounding food, but nothing has met my expectations. Not gross, not terrible, just...meh. Maybe next time I'll try building my own and going heavy on the dressing?"}
{"text":"First time here and had the best Caesar salad I've ever had! Fresh greens, delicious dressing and Mad Spice!!! The crew was very friendly and extremely friendly! Awesome place for a healthy lunch with my Boo :) xoxo
Will definitely be coming back to enjoy and support the local farms who Mad Greens get their produce from!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and healthy. I took my friend Jason there and he was even given a gift card for free meal. My buddy was nice enough to give away his lunch to a stranger and they made him.a new one! For being a healthy option it's really good plus the pickles are tasty. It soaks into the bread which my other friend Josh loves. My friend Josh doesn't like pizza or chipotle  (I know he's a monster) but he would come back"}
{"text":"We have always had great service and food at Mad Greens. We love their salads and the options you get to add or change each one. A healthy and tasty place!"}
{"text":"So... I just had one of the best salads I ever have had. I love Salad and Go and Cafe Zupa salads.. But..... I just tried MAD Greens on Baseline and Val Vista.. OMG!!! One of the best salads. Everything is fresh, dressings made in house from scratch as well. I did the build your own. Half Romaine, Half Spinach, Citrus Chicken, Mushroom, Cucumber,Roasted Red Peppers,Egg, Sundried Tomatoes with pepper and mad seasoning. I tried the Miso Ginger Vinaigrette Dressing (I think that was the type) 
Just had to share this healthy, yummy place. I think it's kind of new.

**The only thing that I'd like to see is bigger drink cup option.  Like a 32oz cup to bring more of the delicious tea on the road."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, we came mid day Sunday afternoon. 

Service: Service was the most disappointing part of  Mad Greens and the reason we won't return.. 
there were three people at the counter, one of which was very abrasive to all three of us while we were ordering. Albeit this is our first time and we're not sure of the process, it doesn't validate an unwelcoming presence. 

Food: I am vegan so I was happy see there were options for me. I \"created your own\" with wild rice, spinach, carrots, mangos, apples and tofu. I really enjoyed this! The gentleman at the counter helped me with vegan sauces. The food is pricey for what you get, $45 for three people. 
My boyfriend said his spicy bacon bowl had no flavor. 

Thanks for offering vegan options but service was too poor for us to want to return."}
{"text":"I stopped ar Mad Greens to pick up a quick and healthy dinner after gettig off work. The service was very slow and food prep line was backed up, it was a Friday evening so I was expecting some wait tine.  The quality of the \"roasted chicken\" on my salad was less than desirable (fatty and slimy). They were out of cranberries however did offer to substitute with another add-in of my choice.  The salad was very bland upon tasting, could only taste the potency of the roasted chicken.  The salad was pricey coming in at over $10 and ended up not tasting good enough to eat.  Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Salads, lots and lots of options. You can call in your order to go which is great for nights i dont want to cook. Gluten free options avail. They have salad recipes or you can customize your own. They have flat bread and panini and soup options. Much healthier than other fast food and much tastier too."}
{"text":"First time to Mad Greens. This place is rad! They should call it Rad Greens. The employees here are so nice to us. They recommended what I should get and they did me well.  I want to recognize the girl with the 50's style glasses, the tall girl with the awesome braid & the guy in the back who all told me what was good & convinced me to try certain things.  THANKS."}
{"text":"What a great spot to get a healthy and quick meal! My salads and toppings have always been fresh! They don't use the cheap iceberg lettuce, but it's either baby greens, romaine, spinach, or kale. I love the Don Quixote and it's my usual go-to for a healthy meal. You also have the option of substituting toppings & proteins. There is a large array of dressing to choose from, but sometimes the salad creation itself is delicious on its own without dressing. 

The staff have always been really nice and courteous!"}
{"text":"I ordered a KIDS grilled cheese.. how do you mess that up? They served my 2 year old a BURNT, HARD AS ROCK sandwich. I literally knocked on it.. and you can hear it. The employee who did not make it, happily replaced it for me. I wanted the pasta instead for her but they were out... so she got rice kids box instead My daughter didn't touch it. Felt like I wasted my money on the kids meal..  I got the Buddha bowl for myself and i asked for the sample of the tofu, and I liked it. When I got my bowl I took one bite and it was CHICKEN.. I was so confused? Cause I did let the girl know that I liked the tofu. Again the girl happily replaced it with a new bowl but this time with TOFU. The bowl was good, but all the confusion ruined my experience.

NOTE: The staff needs to pay more attention to what they are doing."}
{"text":"What I like most about this place is my wife and I can eat out more and not feel guilty, I really enjoy the micro soda on tap here."}
{"text":"They have the best service here!   We come here on a weekly basis & they always go above & beyond.  Today, I came in to get dinner for my husband & I and they were out of the Chipotle Caesar dressing and instead of just saying they were out he offered to make a new batch on the spot if I was willing to wait a bit.  AWESOME :)"}
{"text":"Really good salad and fresh ingredients. You can build your own salad too, nice for calorie counting!!"}
{"text":"Went thinking it would be a fun alternative to the fast food scene. Was not impressed, in fact quite the opposite. My wife and I bought what we thought would be really tasty and healthy food, however the first bite was enough to make my wife and I gag. It was a very rancid taste quite similar to chlorine to a pool. We thought it may have been a bad first taste but with eating a couple more bites, we had had enough. We went back to the register and requested our money back. The cashier looked at me as if she had never heard those words uttered in her life and had to get reinforcement from her manager to allow a refund. Though we bought two salads and I only asked for one refund, they did refund the entire order, to which I am grateful. I would not recommend the establishment, perhaps it was a single one off incident but it is enough for me to keep my distance. After we ate our second salad, we ended up eating somewhere else anyway."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place for salads, super fresh and their chilli powder is perfect on the salad. Only this is, its very pricey!"}
{"text":"It's a salad place. They have 3 hummus options. The salad was tasty and fresh! Delicious! Good ambient to stay. A little expensive: $5 for small salad. I am hoping the salad dresser is healthy then..."}
{"text":"Note what I thought it was. Overall very expensive and little bitty servings of chicken, and the items you want. And they say they have 21 daily made dressing but no Italian or oil/vinegar. Won't be back. MOD Pizza serves a better salad for $5.00"}
{"text":"It didn't seem as if the employees here new what was going on and they gave attitude on the floor. I ordered a kids awesome box. The guy rang up the other box and he told he girl who was preparing the food that he submitted the wrong one and told her what the order was. She accepted it but then made the order that the guy put in correctly and then she realized it and kind of gave attitude to the guy who took the order. Rude."}
{"text":"Great tasty salads. Ingredients from local farmers and uniquely designed salads. Definitely healthy yet filling and worth a try. One of the healthier place to eat in Mesa AZ. Land of the jelly bellies and thick thighs! Coming from Southern California this is a real treat for us!  Now that we are Arizona residents,  we will be frequenting MAD Greens!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Mad Greens!! The Doc Holiday is my favorite salad; I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"One word: awesome! Generous portions, friendly staff, excellent food. Will be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"This place has a nice variety of salads on the menu. As a result Ive been back 4 out of the past 5 days. Day 1 Annie Oakly Panni, day 2 Mad  Cesar, Day 3 Edgar Allan Poe salad with steak, Day 4 Edgar Allan Poe with salmon. 

So far I enjoyed each and everyone of the meals Ive tried. What I also found great is how the salad dressing is made. Its creamy almost like a yogurt consistency.

The only thing is when the customers are done eating it seems they dont know  whether to bus the table themselves or just leave the dishes on the table. During the past 4 days that Ive been, there doesnt seem to be an employee who busses and wipes the tables down.

Since the Mesa restaurant is not very big it would be good to have an employee keep an eye out for tables that need to be bussed.

If not for that I would give it 5 stars. Having said, that I will be back to give other items on the menu a try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I wish we had something like this where I am from. It was so hard to choose what to try on their menu because everything sounded amazing. Decided to go with the \"Mark Twain\" which is pasta base vs. spinach/lettuce but i opted to add spinach in addition to the pasta. The grilled citrus chicken was so delicious, and perfectly cooked. (some places have odd tasting \"spongey\" chicken but this place is definitely doing it right!) Everything about the salad was 5+ stars."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasted decent,    over priced in my opinion for a small salad in my opinion. Can't say I was overly impressed but i wasn't upset we went here.  Probably won't be back however I will say the service was very friendly patient and fast which is why i gave 3 stars"}
{"text":"We came in to wash the flavor of bad food nearby out of my husbands mouth. Seriously, he couldn't wait to get home and brush his teeth. 

We ordered the hummus trio (spicy avocado, beer and garlic). The garlic and beet weren't our favorites but tasted better mixed together. The spicy avocado I really enjoyed. It definitely had a kick. The pita bread was good. 

We had the opportunity to browse the menu and see the various ingredients. My husband was happy they had a steak option for the salads. We will be back to try more food, but wouldn't get the trio again."}
{"text":"Profoundly disappointed...2.25 for double chicken i counted 7 pieces, some were so small i shouldnt even have counted them. Tasteless. Maybe a teaspoon of quinoa. 4 cut in have cherry tomatoes ( the most expensive cherry tomatoes ive ever eaten.) I paid extra for those little tomatoes. The greens were ok, thats about it. They wont be getting anymore money from me"}
{"text":"Maybe once they have been open for awhile the employees will work out the kinks. The food was ok, but not anything special. Like most healthy food places, they are pricey. I was hoping you could build your own salads, but you are not given that options. Add on's are 75cents. Ouch!! I prefer Jason Delhi Over Mad greens any day!"}
{"text":"4 stars.....I'm a fan.
Kind of a MOD pizza for salads.
I went with Mad Molly something......delicious!
I feel healthier just walking out of this place.
LEGIT!!"}
{"text":"I have had only a couple of really good \"big salads\" since moving to Arizona from Los Angeles a year ago. I had the Bonnie Parker Salad today and it was great! The combination was so funky and tasty and I love how they ask you if you want a light, medium or heavy amount of dressing and that they toss it for you. The inside atmosphere is so nice and they have a few tables outside also. The service was great. 

So happy to find this place!"}
{"text":"What a great juice for only 6.50. Tons of seating. The juice had bee pollen!! I loved how tasty it was. The fruits seemed to sing together!"}
{"text":"I like the concept, but they should really make it like some of the build your own pizza joints popping up  (MOD, Eklectic, pie five) and let you build your own. It would be rad! Salad was good, but a little pricey when compared to my go-to salad and go where you get more equally delicious fresh salad."}
{"text":"The food was good but it was $15 for lunch and a drink. Meat selection is limited and mostly just chicken which I do not eat. I really wanted to try the salmon but they no longer have that so I tried steak. It was good but not sure I would spend $15 every day for lunch."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients with variety in low calorie dressing. Friendly staff and fast service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service if you're looking to try something new to try the cold quinoa salad it was delicious, it was a perfect side dish to go along side the half of a chicken Panini."}
{"text":"Norman Bates: We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Marion Crane: Yes. Sometimes just one time can be enough.

Oh the insanity! But one time is not enough for MAD Greens!

M.Greens features salads with fun names like Doc Holliday, Edgar Allen Poe, and Don Quixote. Just to name a few. The salads are full of BIG flavor and mouthwatering fresh ingredients. 

I've also had a lot of success building my own salad. You select your lettuce (choose up to 3 between options romaine, mixed greens, spinach, and kale), your protein (meat and vegetarian options too), up to 4 other ingredients (cheeses, nuts, fruits, and veggies) and your dressing (20+ options). If salads aren't really your thing then you are in the wrong place. Jk. They also have wraps, pannis, juices, soups, hummus AND dessert (Salted Caramel Cookie and 7 Layer Bar!!)!

My only small bump was that the staff seemed a little confused. One employee didn't know the difference between the roasted red peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. Also they were unsure of what cheese was which... Hopefully, that was just a fluke because basic knowledge of what you serve should be should be in training... I would suggest being an informed consumer, know what you are ordering and double check your items when you get them.

To quench your thirst they have Maine Root Fountain Soda, Fresh Brewed Tea (herbal hibiscus, passon fruit mango, white pear (I can't decide!!) and bottled 3rd Street Teas! Yum, yum, YUM!  

Mad Greens, I'm a little crazy for you!"}
{"text":"My first time here and the staff was SOOOO friendly and helpful, it was an honest pleasure to have been one of their customers. Lots of smiles!

Now - that being said, their food was absolutely disgusting. I had one bite of a salad with ranch dressing and literally spit it out. Yuck! I've never tasted a dressing so revolting! Then I moved on to my pita with garlic hummus, and it was the worst. It tasted like bland pinto beans without any flavor whatsoever. 

I threw it all away and now I'm trying to find another place to order from to get that gross taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I LOVE MAD GREENS so this is a review of this particular location, and not of the entire chain. 

Mad Greens makes delicious, fresh and healthy salads at a reasonable price. Love that. 

Did NOT love the service I received today during a business meeting lunch. The line only had two people in front of us but took ten minutes to even get helped. The girl was so soft spoken we couldn't hear her, and she wouldn't speak up after we said repeatedly we couldn't understand anything she was saying. 

The worst part is that the girl who was mixing our salad had a runny nose and wiped her nose on her hand - THREE TIMES - while making our salad. Completely unsanitary and unappetizing. 

We then waited for someone to ring us up for another solid five minutes. We tried to ask multiple workers, who all ignored us and proceeded to rush around doing other things like filling napkin dispensers (priorities?). 

Really horrible, rude, service. Hopefully it's because the location is new?"}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good.  The menu selections are awesome and everything on the salad line looks very fresh.  The salad line appeared very clean unlike some restaurants that have a line such as this.  The portions are very big!  You definitely get your money's worth!  My only concern is I don't feel like they have enough help on the front line.  It takes awhile to get through the line because of this.  

I observed the manager on duty and she appeared to be doing everything she could to make the guests happy.  She was very friendly and you could see her job was important to her.  

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great salad selection, cucumber-mint juice is perfect for summer!  Staff is super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Really love the concept of this place. Extensive selection of salads or you can make your own with a large amount of ingredients and delicious dressings. Lots of vegan options, which is very much appreciated. Salads are rather huge and substantive. Awesome salad dressing selection -- the two I tried were very tasty. Friendly service and well-priced. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday afternoon, walked in, floors were wet and chairs were up? I honestly thought they were closing up shop til I saw people sitting there eating and three people at the counter. 

First time in, alot of choices to choose from! Was pretty excited to try this place, since it kind of fits into my diet.

Tried the southwestern bowl and the hummus trio.
Southwestern Bowl was pretty flavorful, I didn't realize I got to choose what goes into it, eventhough everything is listed and I gave them the okay to put everything in?

The girl \"helping me\" with my bowl was a bit rude, she asked me a series of questions when preparing my bowl, but I couldn't hear her, she spoke too fast and there was just too much tude to understand. When I asked her to repeat herself, she just gave me more tude, so I just picked whatever to get it over with, then she slid my bowl over the the guy.

The guy on the other hand didn't even know what type of bowl mine was, so I wonder if my bowl was even made correctly!? I mean it's a signature bowl... I thought?

Second girl was nice though and brought over my hummus plate since it wasn't ready by the time we paid.

Food: A three star at best, just too pricey for what it was, barely any protein but a crap ton of wild rice, but flavor was there, only ate maybe 1/4 of it and brought the rest home.
Hummus plate, I think was worth the money and the hummus I actually enjoyed.

Service: I most likely won't be returning, if I wanted underage kids with attitude problems to serve me, I'd spend my money at the BK lounge."}
{"text":"Love this place! I found the Doc Holiday and stayed there! I love the blend of the lettuce with fruits. 

I often will recommend this place because it's fresh, fast and tasty. They have a nice variety, not just salads but sandwiches and a juice bar. 

I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is very new. I like where they are going with it, fresh, new recipes and what not. The salad was very fresh. Tons if different options which is nice. The only draw back is portioning. I believe the salads to be very small for what you pay. These are basically $11 salads. Not worth it in my book when you can go to Sweet Tomatoes, pay the same amount, and have way more food options and bigger salads. We used a coupon to try a salad and we did. It was delicious but we most likely wont go back."}
{"text":"I came to Mad Greens since I received a free salad offer in the mail.  It looked like a Chipotle but for salads.  It was basically an assembly line where you see them make your salad in front of you.  The person that greeted me was energetic and friendly.   I ordered the Don Quixote salad.  The person that added the ingredients to the bowl was decent.  She wasn't really friendly, but not rude either.  The last person asked me if I wanted light, medium or heavy salad dressing.  I asked for light.  But she obviously doesn't have a handle on what that is because my salad was drenched with salad dressing, to the point where the greens were soggy and it looked like soup at the bottom of my bowl.  It would probably be helpful if they had a cup to measure how they define light, medium and heavy.  The current system seems left up to the person who has the salad dressing in their hand.  I also was disappointed that there was supposed to be avocado as one of the ingredients, but I only had two pieces of avocado in my salad.  The flavor was good.  But did I like it enough to return and pay $10.15 plus tax for it again?  Probably not.  I would go to Salad and Go over Mad Greens anytime.  Salad and Go is consistent, never soggy, less expensive and much faster than Mad Greens.  I definitely wasn't feeling the assembly line.  Expect to wait if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"I went in 1115 in the morning on a Sunday morning and the area where you pick up your drink and silverware dirty.   The restaurant only had two tables being used with three people in each.  How did this get dirty? It must been left over from last night. There was one girl working the front.   She would take your order, make your salad and take your money.  Two guys in back making sandwiches.  There were five people in line but it took three to four minutes per person for the girl up front per each order.  She was working very hard and fast but the place was very understaffed. Two people in front of me walked out after waiting so I stayed.  I ordered a sandwich for me and the person with me ordered a salad.  The one girl doing all the work gave me the salad and the sandwich came out later.   We shared the salad and had already finished it before the sandwich came out.  The salad was pretty good and the sandwich was very good that is why they got any stars.  While we were eating there were two couples in line.   One couple left after waiting so long.  Very very understaffed!  I would hate to see what it's like if this restaurant was busy.  Sadly I will not be back since there are about 20 restaurants on this corner to try."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I got an overwhelming smell of chemicals. An employee was mopping so I assume the chemical smell was the floor cleaner. As I made my way to the order station the smell dissipated. I grabbed a menu so I could read and not hold up the line. The salads listed on the menu sound delicious, but I opted to create my own. The manager had to come take my order as the 2 employees were engrossed in their conversation and didn't notice I was as even there. The manager answered every question I had regarding ingredients in various items available on the line. I created my salad and took it to-go. It was a few hours later when I was able to enjoy the salad. I got my salad dry so it wouldn't wilt. The greens and apples were crisp, chicken moist and almonds toasted nicely. 
I will mention the reduced fat balsamic is made with chickpeas, which I love! As a chef, I enjoy alternative ingredients, especially in dressings. 
I will definitely order from them again, I saw they were on DoorDash!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok but the speed of service is really bad. I think they need to have a better system too much of a bottle neck. It was more like slow casual instead of fast casual."}
{"text":"Started off great. I would usually order a chicken Caesar salad. After a few visits I noticed the lettuce was yellow not green... consistently...and the chicken was virtually non existent in the salad...1 ice cream scoop full in a large salad. You can get a much better salad for a few dollars cheaper at Panera Bread Company. It's disappointing too..I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Sadly I wasn't impressed - good amount of salad yet stingy on the chicken - prices are higher than other places I've been to"}
{"text":"I've looked high and low for a good salad place. On a tip from my BFF, we met there for lunch and I had the Bonnie Parker. I fell in love. Generous portions of grilled chicken breast and a mixture of delicious healthy greens, nuts and fruit. I've had other salads since and they are all good. They have over 20 salad dressings. You can custom build your own salad if you prefer. Prices very reasonable. All fresh quality ingredients and their sodas are all natural with cane sugar. Their teas are also delicious. Staff friendly and no obligatory tip jar. Get the Mad Greens spill-resistant tumbler and all your drinks are only a buck with unlimited refills. No better salad franchise than MG - even their Phoenix Melrose locale is good. My new fave \"let's do lunch\" spot with my gal-pals. :)"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here ha been delicious (with the exception of the hummus, gross!!) The mighty Aphrodite salad is absolutely amazing! I was a little disappointed when I visited today to find out that they no longer offer the half a Panini and side salad option. Nine out of 10 times I just get a big salad so I may do with that but it was disappointing to know that I could not order a small salad and have a Panini any longer if I was in the mood for that.

I really want to give this place five stars but I had a knock off a couple because of some questionable employee practices. I myself and I've also heard from others that some of the staff does not work gloves when preparing the panini a. It is slightly irritating as well they do not wear gloves on the salad line. When I asked them while making my salad why they were not wearing gloves the response was we don't have to we're not actually touching the food. I think this is a rather silly response and gloves are what $.10 a pair we can't spring to put those on our hands just to appease our customers?

I would definitely go back because I am a huge fan but they should probably bring back a half Panini and a half salad option as well as put gloves on their employees hands. It is the food industry there should not be an excuse to not wear gloves"}
{"text":"If you think nutritious cannot be delicious then Mad Greens will prove you wrong! You can either choose a salad that has very nutritious and complimentary ingredients or custom build your own creation. All of the ingredients are fresh and the dressings (or at least the three that I tried) taste sensational! The way that the restaurant is structured makes it very easy to get lots of protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and of course deliciousness."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. The Don Quixote is awesome. I'm not a huge ginger fan so I opt out of the dressing and get the Spicy Sriracha Almond Vinaigrette instead.  Awesome taste, just the right amount of kick.

Unfortunately, no one that works at this place is in a real rush to make your salad.  One takes your order and fills the bowl with your greens and protein, the other is there to do the toppings and the third is there for dressing and check out.  Well somewhere between the greens getting in the bowl and checkout, all hell breaks loose.  I was in line for a good 25 minutes just waiting for a salad.  Mind you, the line isn't long and for a place that makes their salads to order, it really shouldn't be that slow.

Suggestion?  Put a couple of more people on the line to get things going.  I love me some Don Quixote, but I have things to do man!"}
{"text":"Loveee this place simple fresh ingredients. You can build your own wrap or salad. The portions are ridiculous you can either share or I save the rest for dinner. Wish there was a mad green at every corner, one could only wish."}
{"text":"So glad this place finally opened . There was one when I lived in Colorado and I loved it !!!"}
{"text":"I finally came and tried this place. I've been meaning to since it opened forever ago! There is definite room for improvement. If I could, I would give 3.5 stars. As it goes, I decided to round down.

I came with a friend and ordered a large Don Quixote. I told the lady that took my order and put the lettuce in the bowl that I would like no mango and the red pepper dressing. She said ok, put the bowl down, and started helping another person. The next lady took my bowl and asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp, so I said shrimp. Then she went to dish the rest of the toppings, and I narrowly got a word in before a scoop of mango was dumped. Obviously there is zero communication. The lady did offer a different topping to replace the mango, which I happily accepted.

When I went to pay I noticed that my salad was in the smaller container. The cashier asked if I wanted more lettuce to fill a large container and I declined. I guess the large is just extra lettuce with the same amount of toppings? Interesting. I decided to get a combo with pita and hummus for $2.50 extra to try it out. My total came to almost $17. I was so confused by this until I realized that the shrimp was actually extra. How annoying. This being my first time there, I just assumed you had a choice for the same price because she didn't say anything. I would not have paid extra for shrimp had I known.

As for the food, it was really good. The mad spice they put on the avocado was delicious and the red pepper dressing was surprisingly good. I really enjoyed the salad a lot, but I really did not enjoy the price. The garlic hummus was also good but the pita was very basic and cold. Overall, the hummus and pita was kind of meh for me.

All in all, if I want a delicious salad I'll go to Wildflower or Salad and Go for a significantly cheaper price. I may be back to try their bowls out, but even that is iffy."}
{"text":"I went during lunch time at the recommendation of a coworker when they first opened. I now eat here at the minimum 3 times a week. It's refreshing and delicious. The staff are always so nice. The ingredients are fresh. The best salad place I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious healthy food with quick service. That employees are very friendly and helpful. I especially enjoy that I can get it delivered with Uber eats."}
{"text":"If every salad tasted this good I would actually eat salad!!! I LOVE the Greek salad! Seriously the best salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"I normally get my detox and energy juices at a a holistic juice bar, but unfortunately, they are closed on Wednesdays. I drove all the way to this shopping area because there's another well known chain juice bar here, but had an awful experience with their service. I ended up at Mad Greens to get my juice fix instead. I didn't know that they also offer energy drinks, so I'm glad I checked out Yelp. I've been feeling lethargic lately, so I needed a pick me up. They ran out of the detox juice, so the girl behind the counter recommended the Wake Me Up juice. It had a little more calories, but it did the trick! Service was phenomenal, and the girls behind the counter seemed  happy. Keep up the positive attitude girls!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Originally from Colorado, now they're here in AZ. You have a variety of healthy choices here. They have salads, panini, wraps, soups, juices, smoothies, dessert and they also have a kids menu. The ingredients were fresh! I've tried their hummus trio, it has the roasted garlic, spicy avocado & their roasted beet hummus (my favorite!). The I am Siam salad was also delicious and is loaded with 54gram of protein! It's got warm quinoa, slow-roasted chicken, kale, peanuts, carrots, green onions, edamame, spinach with ginger soy dressing. I also liked their Ty Cobb salad, it's got romaine, grilled southwestern chicken, avocado, bacon, red onions, eggs, tomatoes but we switched the dressing to chipotle sauce. I was not a fan of blue cheese. The service was great, they made sure that it was okay with me the ingredient that they're going to put in my salad."}
{"text":"Great food, like the concept & decent menu! But come on... $10 for a small salad really?!!! Probably won't be back very often."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a salad. 4 options only sucks. They aren't very many good options to add as toppings. The 2 guys that worked here didn't seem like they like their jobs. My mixed greens tasted like they had dirt on them. The flavors of the salad were gross. My biggest complaint was the servers weren't wearing gloves when they were putting their hands all over items. I don't recommend and will not be back"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed. Ordered a large salad and there was very little salad but full off croutons & other toppings. Lettuce was a bit wilted.  Plus it was $10. 
I can get a bigger, fresher salad at Wendys for $6. 

Not going back. 
The people I went out to lunch with ordered paninis & they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"$11 for a build your own salad w/ shrimp & no drink? Way to overpriced in my opinion. I've had better salads for way less. Wasn't impressed with the dressings either. I would not come back due to the fact of prices & taste."}
{"text":"Our office ordered take-out from here for the third time today. 

The customer service on the phone was not that great and the girl who answered had a very hard time hearing us leave the order. This is our third time ordering from this location for our office and each time something isn't right. 

This time, after going through the order with me she advised everything was there (although I didn't have our written list of orders with me) .. As I was backing out they came running out and said they had more of my order that they forgot. Ok, that was great that they came and stopped me! 

When I got back to the office, we found that all 7 salads had NO dressing. Where there were supposed to be two juices there was only one (which I hadn't known there were supposed to be two) and for one of the sandwhiches a nut allergy, appeared to have nuts on it. 

While we have tried them 3 times, we are really on the fence about ordering from them again.."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting MAD greens & I feel extremely ripped off! $7 for a small juice is outrageous! I make green smoothies at home all the time with ingredients that cost less than that drink! I thought I would give it a try considering I was out running around and had no time to stop at home. After opening the drink I read on the bottle it isn't pasteurized (which I am pregnant and shouldn't have non-pasteurized) so on top of paying a ridiculous amount I couldn't even drink it!! I could cry with how much my total bill was. $21 for just me!! By the time it came to pay it was to late to cancel everything! I wish I could get my money back."}
{"text":"Just took advantage of the Kids Eat Free until May 31st promotion and our girls absolutely loved their Awesome Boxes. They were filled with healthy but yummy ingredients and they were big hits. We tried the Garlic Hummus and it was delicious - and also a great value lots of yummy hummus and pita for about 3 bucks. We also tried the Cuban Panini and the Mighty Aphrodite. Both were very good. The Mighty Aphrodite was absolutely perfect for summer - full of strawberries and fresh mozzarella."}
{"text":"Quick service, clean facility, and fresh food. I stopped in for a to go lunch on a busy week day. Big salad, expensive price. I wish it would tell you if ingredients were at least organic- so you can feel slightly better about the $10 salad with 1/2 cup of protein. I'm not sure what macros but all and all I feel better about stopping in to eat here rather than Taco Bell or McDonald's."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 MAD Greens locations around Phoenix multiple times. I have had every salad on the regular menu except the Mark Twain (it's a *pasta* salad, so it is last on my list). So, it is no secret that I enjoy the place. This one has the familiar layout, but seems to have more seating than the other locations, although a lot of the extra is outside. That's great for this time of year but could get interesting once we have triple-digit temperatures. 

The people were friendly and efficient, the salads were made quickly and payment was handled as we made it to the end of the line. The ingredients were fresh, although my wife said that the Romaine was a little bitter in her salad. 

I like that they have 4 different types of cold teas available - I don't drink a lot of soda, so having options beyond generic \"black tea\" is nice. That said, I do like the sodas that they carry at MAD Greens, too :/"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing!! Delicious food, great variety and HEALTHY!!! Its new, and the few times I have been there its been slow so i always get in and get my food right away. The salads are actually filling and they have natural soda options without all the normal crap they put in soda's these days. 
I usually pay about $10-12 a salad But I guess we do have to pay more these days for healthier options. 
The Sriracha salad dressing is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My two girlfriends and I are trying to eat healthier so we decided to try Mad Greens. I had the Doc Holiday salad and it was SO good! One of my friends ordered the Crazy Ivan and we argued whose salad was better.  The other friend had the Mad Caesar and a cup of their Hearty Vegetable soup and enjoyed both. They have some healthier alternative sodas called Maine Root and some fun flavored ice teas. Nice, clean atmosphere. A great place to meet and carry on a conversation. The manager Mike and his staff were very friendly. Can't wait to go back to try another salad."}
{"text":"So happy this place came to Mesa. Always fresh food and flavors and a great variety of options. 

I've experienced both overly friendly and borderline rude service when ordering. The food is consistently food, though.

Don Quixote is where it's at."}
{"text":"You know the opening scene of Lost when everyone is either wandering around shell shocked, freaking out and stumbling into spinning turbines but Jack is the only one who has a clue? That's the perfect description of MAD Greens. In this case, it was the purple shirt gal behind the counter being Jack, desperately trying to wrangle her dazed and confused staff. It was actually comical how stunned they all were. 

I arrived at 1pm on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. Took about 40 minutes. 

The good: the pita with my soup was soft and warm. The soda is from some independent company and was also good.

The meh: soup was ok I guess... almost as good as the ones in the deli at Safeway.

The bad: my sandwich was pretty sad. Almost zero avocado, chicken was bland and over cooked. Nothing looks fresh and vibrant. I could here Chef Robert loudly saying \"SALT... PEPPER!!\" My wife's chicken wrap was bland and boring. 

When you do finally get your food you have to pick it up and move down to the till, but you have to ask for a tray (which is so small bit even half my food couldn't fit further confusing the person) and when you get there you'll find nowhere to set it. I balanced half my stuff on a stack of menus and held the rest and paid one handed. It's a bummer, healthy places aren't super common and this really fell flat."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a MAD Greens and I would definitely come back.  They had a good selection of pre-planned salads as well as the option to create your own.  Unless you are starving, the regular size salad is perfect.  I had the Don Quixote which had a nice mix of savory flavors.  We also had the humus trio which for pre-made humus was pretty good.  And I like that they carry a Mom-and-pop brand soda - Maine Root.  For a refreshing, fast salad for lunch or dinner, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great staff very accommodating and friendly.  The Pancho Villa is a must. Probably the best salad I've ever had"}
{"text":"Glad this place finally opened! It's my first time and I got the Soleri salad. I wasn't sure about the unsweetened chocolate in the salad, but it's actually very good! My only disappointment is I had hoped for a slightly larger salad then what is considered the large salad. I'm looking forward to trying more delicious food from this place!"}
