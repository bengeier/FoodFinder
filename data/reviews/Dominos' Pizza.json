{"text":"Quick , convenient and I like their pizza they usually have good deal And good food. Never had an issue with them. Always seem to get my order right.  It's so close that pick up is possible too. So it's one of my favourite places for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"I came for a pickup. When I arrived at the store, I stood in the store for 10 minutes without anyone talking to me. There was no one in the front. The two guys looked at me and didn't say anything. after 10 minutes, the only girl working finally walked over and asked if I ordered yet.  The girl apologized as she thought the two guys already took the order. Apparently, the order was ready when I came in."}
{"text":"man my favorite pizza chain, but today's order wasn't the greatest.  the people were nice when I went to pick it up though!   and their online ordering is awesome! they even have a progress bar that tells you what's happen ring and how close it is to getting ready. COOL STUFF"}
