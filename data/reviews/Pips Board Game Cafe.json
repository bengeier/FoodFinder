{"text":"This place is so great!! Huge selection of board games, fun location, delicious food - definitely would recommend for a a date night or just a place to go with some game loving friends. Love it!"}
{"text":"A wonderful cafe that has both great food and awesome games. Went with a group of friends and was surprised at how delicious the food was for a board game cafe. The game Master was helpful in suggesting games for us, and there was a huge selection to choose from. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My kid and I got food poisoning here. No compensation. Stars because games were fun here."}
{"text":"2 stars for the concept and the location.  But $5 per player is kinda steep (think family- it adds up quickly!).  And food isn't particularly cheap either. And not very good (shrimp scarcely there in shrimp wrap, super salty fries barely edible). Terrible server finished to ruin the experience. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I love that  a boardgame cafe has opened in Calgary- they have an excellent selection of boardgames,  with standards like Settlers of Catan and Trivial Pursuit, but they also have a bunch of boardgames that I've always wanted to try but never bought- Alhambra,  Arkham Horror, Fluxx...  The list goes on. When my bf and myself walked in at 6 pm on a Sunday,  we filled up the last empty table. My latte was pretty yummy, and they had a decent selection of beers. We ordered dinner while we played one or games. I found my mac and cheese was too salty,  and he was underwhelmed by his dish too (I think it was a chicken pot pie). In any case,  I will definitely be back for the boardgames!"}
{"text":"Such a great place (and idea!) to catch up with some friends over some snacks and drinks while playing one of the many board games selections they have. A great alternative to a noisy pub or restaurant. Something different to do that is kid/family friendly and provides back to basics entertainment that doesn't involve screen time.   The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, it's in what I am assuming is an old converted house. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The food is good, simple fair but fairly priced and made fresh.   This place is a really great alternative to the run of the mill restaurant/pub options in this city. Highly recommend, and I feel like by spending my money here I am supporting a family business and people in my community, not lining the pockets of a chain restaurant corporation.   PS - there is limited parking around the back!"}
{"text":"People are fun and welcoming. Staff is super friendly and the selection is great. I love this place. Makes me wanna come here all the time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Honestly I've been there multiple times and only once was to actually play board games! The food and the service is usually fantastic! It's a place that's great for friends, families, anyone. Their menu is very diverse and there's something for anyone. I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"We had eaten here before it switched concepts and consumed a fine and tasty breakfast that day. We took two bites a piece of our meals today then we were overcome with the acrid, sour taste of whatever the yellow sauce on the Eggs Benny was. I can assure you it was not hollandaise sauce. We just cut our losses and left. A sad $36 for nothing. The excess star was given for our server, who was pleasant and nice, who may actually have been Jared Leto undercover for a role, lol!  Anyway, we may return to play games, but the lingering, slightly sickening taste of the dishes we ordered has left a bad taste in our mouths for longer than the afternoon and will keep us away from breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and always enjoy my time here! For $5 you can stay up to 3 hours I believe and they have hundreds of games to choose from. They also serve food and drinks as well, though Ive never ordered any food, I did get the house white (which was reasonably priced at $5.50 for 6oz) which is the copper moon pinot grigio. All the servers here are really nice, and there's free parking around back. They're also open late on weekends (until 1am) so a good place to hang out especially on the cold winter nights. We heard yesterday that they're going to be closed as of March 25, but I definitely recommend stopping by before then. I have heard rumours that they're looking to open up in a different location though. I really hope they do!!"}
{"text":"If you go for the food you've made the wrong choice, the prices don't match the taste. Many times what you receive is not what you ordered from the menu. At best the food is average and often less so. The value just isn't there.  If you go for the gaming you'll find a small location with a basic selection (over 100 unique titles, compared to 1000+ titles at other places I've been) of games that would be irritating to play with the loud noise in a relatively tiny location. IT makes playing games a headache... literally.  The ambiance of Pips was basic, it was clean but seemed cold. The chairs were wooden and basic, most game stores would have better, the Sentry Box likely has the best comfort in seating around (a step up from the 90's lawn chairs of exploding death lol). The tables were small and elbow room was at a premium, I'm sure most games would be a tight fit for one table.   Hummus and pita, store bought, fairly bland, and the pita was hard like rock. My friend was more forgiving on it but not that much.  Candied bacon, tasty (when it wasn't charcoal), not sure if it was store bought, probably was as candying food is work.  Pretzel bites and beer mustard. Well, more like tiny loaf of bread. The mustard was nice. Not what the menu said.  Assorted pickles, umm, no, it was 1 tiny pickle and other 'pickled items' (like peppers), not what the menus said and definitely store bought.  Beef burger, a little dry though tolerable.  Chicken burger, had a ridiculous bun that made the burger inedible with it (it was like a top hat), chicken once separated was alright, cheese was tasty, nice thick bacon. Overly mayonnaise'd, despite specifically requesting only \"half mayo and no other sauce please\".  Caesar Salad, nice, just like you'd hope a Caesar salad to be.  French fries, frozen I'd wager, acceptable but not my favourite type of fry.  Tea & Coffee selection Small.   Beer & Wine selection tiny. Several of each, bare bones, no coolers or hard for mixes.  Dessert selection minuscule. 3, store bought I'd guess."}
{"text":"First time at Pips. The servers are lovely and very kind. The game master was super helpful too.  Okay so the food...Never have I tasted such terrible food from a restaurant. Like inedible and weird plus my stomach hurt for hours afterwards.  I would only order fries and a beer at most and stay clear away from anything that requires culinary skill whatsoever! Too bad because the menu has some good options but man was it awful. We ordered chicken pot pie, pickles, hummus and veggies. The chicken pot pie was sickly creamy with frozen vegetables and questionable meat, the hummus literally tasted like vinegary mustard and the vegetables were oddly lacking in any flavour and were not fresh. Finally the pickles are just plain gross. I gave this place 2 stars because it's fun and they have a great selection of games! It'd be a 5 star place if you could actually eat the food.  Again. Great staff!!  P.s. The server told us that the menu will be changing to reflect feedback (I.e the pickles are actually pickled soft yams or something)  P.p.s there is a $5 charge for playing a board game per person. Wine is only $6 a glass!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun night out with your couple-friends, or 3 friendly fellas and/or fems :) Been here a couple times and really enjoy the whole vibe & concept. And surprisingly, the food is pretty damn good. HIGHLY recommend ordering the brownie (then wait 20 minutes, but its worth it). Oh ya, they have a couple board games too. I'd give it 5 stars, but there is zero airflow in that place, and not a fan, be it stand-up or ceiling, in the whole place. Summer time sweatathon for this tonne of fun, but that's a personal complaint, not a knock on Pips. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I came here for my husbands birthday the other night with 10 of us. We were happy to pay for the 18% gratuity for our large number party... until we were neglected and not served very well. The server was annoyed the entire time we were there and did not check up on us. For the times we did need something we had to chase her down. At one point she asked with a stern tone asking if we were still playing (we had taken a break from playing and please bare in mind there was no other people waiting for a table.) We as a group felt obligated to pick a game and start one right away. We were fortunate that we were in good company or else this server would have ruined our evening. At the end of the night, we had separate bills, and ours came to $17.23, we had given her a $20 and did not receive any change or wasn't asked if we would require any; from my understanding our bill already included a hefty 18% gratuity. My husband and I are very into board games but unfortunately we won't be returning due to terrible service."}
{"text":"The food and coffee/tea was great.  Service was wonderful. Love that you can play games and they have a good variety, including the classics which we love to play...though we opted out playing chess as their board game for chess was really small.  Nice quaint/hole in the wall type place. I didn't mind paying $5/person to play board games for 3 hours because of the selection and having staff on that knows how the games work if you wanted to try something new.  Great for a date or a group of friends gathering.  Will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for the first stop on a bachelor party (I know, were party animals) and had a damn good time. All 8 of us enjoyed the service, there was a LOT of games, and the food was pretty damn good. I would have given the place a 5 star but the tables where a little small for 4 fat guys, their food beer and a quick game of King of Tokyo (also 5 star, would recommend). CONSIDER MY OVER SIZED NEEDS! #fatshaming #justkidding"}
{"text":"Like this place, the staff is nice... it's a good place to chill but of course there are still room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great place to go when you run out of things to do. I wish there was more seating, you do get kicked out after a few hours if people are waiting. The food is decent, nothing spectacular. I'd recommend the yam fries & brownie!"}
{"text":"I'm seeing more and more of these places and thought it would a reasonable first or second date idea for a Tinder/Bumble type match.  I figured better than JUST coffee and we can chit chat while we do something kinda goal oriented...   Here's the thing ... if you're a competitive type (me) and your date's all \"cooperative\" and... what's the word ... (boring? socialized?)... I don't even know the word for it... a date here will highlight that schizm \"quick fast in a hurry\" ... wow... I've had two otherwise promising dates tank after a trip to Pips...  (The old \"In-Your-Face-Triple-Word-Score-Dance\" DOES NOT impress the ladies).  Catalyst?  Cause?  Who knows?  ANYWAYS... other than highlighting how bad a date I am... Pips is okay.  Really nice staff (surely patient with the same questions about how it works all the time) ... alright Americanos... but nothing special.  People seem to enjoy themselves.  \"You probably will too,\" he said with an indifferent shrug."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome selection of board games (which all seem to be in pretty great shape as of my visit), and good and helpful service staff.  The meals leave something to be desired, but the snack food was great.  I'd say don't go if you're just looking for someplace to have lunch/dinner, but if you're into board games and want to try something new, it's a great place to sit down and have some munchies and a beverage while throwing down dice."}
{"text":"It was busy and Mardi Gras, and their first Mardi Gras so maybe they were still working out the kinks.   Patio was nice, and we got some great sun.  We didn't play a board game because we didn't have time, but they have a great selection of games. Drinks were quick and awesome.   However, the food took over 45 minutes. I'm not exaggerating because I was watching the time on my cellphone. When we received our food, the burger bun was really cold, and the fries were raw (even though I asked for extra crispy). I was really disappointed in the food, because when they first were marketing, they said they were very proud of the food. (But their deep fried pickles were really good)  The owner(and our server) was kind, and apologized. So I have to give him props for being apologetic.   However, the serving team needs improvement. When his serving team came to help, there was a new family who sat down beside us. They sat down to a table that was full of glassware. When the server came she said, did you just get here are you new? They responded that they were new. So she cleared only 75% of the glassware and left a few bottles. She just assumed it was there's, when it was actually from the previous customers. She did not bother to ask.    When she came to us, I let her know our food was taking a while and asked her to find out how long our food would take. I think she just told the owner there was a problem, but did not actually communicate what we had mentioned. So when the owner came to us, he said \"is there a problem.\" Obviously the girl did not communicate our needs. He looked a little bit embarrassed on the failed communication.   In addition, the whole hour we were there, I did not see her carry a tray. Even when she was carrying 5 drinks in her arm.  It looked highly unprofessional.   In the future, we will come for games and drinks. However, not the food."}
{"text":"A board game cafe? Neat idea. Went in to have a look, and we were impressed with the massive selection. $5 per person if you want to play any. That's a good deal if you're with a group and will be playing a while. We just wanted food. We were quickly sat and given drinks, but the server seemed to forget about us after that. Our menus were closed for 15-20 minutes waiting to place our order. She ended up taking the orders of two tables that came in after we had closed our menus before us.  I had the chicken pot pie. The edge of the shell was crispy, though the middle on top was soft and not browned. The inside tasted alright, though there was barely any chicken. The fries weren't crispy, and were luke warm. Girlie had a burger that she wasn't impressed with (Over salty) 3 stars only because of beer and board games."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Amazing. Full of young couples, groups, I didn't see many families there but it would be a good place to go!  Service: AmaZing times two. All employees are super attentive and exited to help you learn new games. I think our servers name was Luke!  I've been there twice and I'm super exited to become a regular."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here on Sunday for brunch. We were in a bit of a rush to catch a flight and this place could get all 8 of us in right away so we went for it.   First of all, I was not happy with the fact that you had to pay $5 to play a game with your meal. I have been to board game cafes before, and have never experienced it before so I was a bit annoyed by that.   We ordered off the very limited breakfast menu (6 or so items to choose from), and waited a while for our food. We were a large group, so we didn't mind- but it was definitely a longer wait for a pretty non-busy restaurant.   Our food came, and unfortunately, it was as though none of our orders were right. There was stuff missing, things swapped around from one persons plate to another's, and the waitress was clearly overwhelmed.   At the end of the day, the food was not really that great. My bacon was alto hard to eat, and I never got my hashbrowns. My pancakes were not very warm when I got them, and the waitress never brought butter.   Overall, just a mediocre place."}
{"text":"Went for a walk and saw a crowd outside... Decided to go in. We were amazed that at 7pm on an Sunday night, this place was packed! Once we got the last table, one of the owners came by and greeted us, and explained how things worked. We order Chai Latte (was deliciously creamy- wished I had a Jug full!), hot chocolates, and tea. All came hot and were flavorful. We started playing card game Skippo and it actually was a great time. The food took a while, but not surprising for such a busy place. The girls raved about the Mac & Cheese- it had a creamy cheese topped with bacon and fried crunchy onions. I was surprised they didn't lick the plate. It was $5 each to sit and play for 3 hours and we spent about $20 each when it was all said and done. I loved the clean and bright atmosphere. The games were organized and easily accessible. More than once I seen the Game Master chatting and giving instructions on games to newbies. I would love to come back again! It def was a great evening. Lost a star for having to ask to refill drinks, but overall- Great!!"}
{"text":"Good food, service and games! I had chicken pot pie and Caesar salad and it was some damn good chicken pot pie! Our waitress was very kind and helpful. The game options were very diverse and there was a lot to choose from which was great. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Fun place with tons of games, great food, and friendly service! We ordered snacks to share as well as a few sandwiches and they were all great! Our waiter told us the chef focuses on locally sourced ingredients - if that's important to you. They also support other local businesses through their beer and coffee selections. There is a large variety of games to play which they will kindly help you select and show you how to play! All in all, it was great night out and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Pips a solid 4 stars for a number of reasons. I came for a date with my 2 year old nephew and we both chowed down on a delicious , crispy and golden grilled cheese topped with a deep fried pickle (YES) and accompanied by fries ( that taste like the Golden Arches ..ahem!)- they nailed this simple dish that adults and kids love. The patio is great with lots of seating in the sun and our server was a very friendly and helpful girl. Our meals came out fast which helps when on a date with a toddler. I'll be back for some games and adult fun guaranteed"}
{"text":"Nice place to play board games and enjoy drinks. They have good selection of games and they even have the food menu which is alright. But overall its good..."}
{"text":"Very positive vibe and atmosphere. They have wall to wall shelves of games, many of which I haven't even heard of. Food was reasonably priced and delicious as well. They also have unlimited gaming promotions at certain times too. Highly recommended if you're in the Marda area of Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is definitely cool...staff is super friendly and the food is really good.  It's just way toooo expensive. The food is so pricey, which is fine but when you add 5 dollars for game play per person it gets unreasonable. I think if you order food it should be free to play. We went with 3 adults and a 6 year old and it was still 20 dollars, we played one game for 15 minutes. All kids should be free to play. Also there are very few vegan options."}
