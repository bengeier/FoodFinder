{"text":"waiting at the counter for a takeout, the cook answered his cell while perparing. a few mins later, when the cashier asking staffs if anyone had change for $20 which i paid, he again reached for his wallet bare handed and went on perparing the next second. this is what i call DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in downtown, better than all the others. It is famous for the cuisine in north-east China, also spicy food. The price is very reasonable and the service is fast. Don't miss it if you have opportunity to have a try!"}
{"text":"I like the bullfrog dish, it's my favourite, the rest of dishes are just fine similar to other Chinese restaurant.  The service is bad tho, been there couples time they waiters will never ask our opinions and not even notice us, have to put up the hand for so long even when it's not busy. Like they never pay attention. Beside the service it's not bad place."}
{"text":"The food was good. We had scallion pancake, spicy chicken, and sautéed spicy cabbage. Really enjoyed every bit."}
{"text":"I have been there so many times. Firstly it is very close to my home, and secondly, their food is really tasty and authentic. The service is very friendly too and the serving is speedy so you won't wait too long for your order."}
{"text":"Wow.  I was so disappointed with my take-out.  It was bland, didn't salt the vegetables and got my order wrong with a salad that was utterly inedible which I had to throw away.  That was money down the drain. I'm Chinese and I know my Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great new place for Chinese food! The prices are very reasonable and portions very hearty! Add that a tasteful and original plates, and you have a recipe for success! Good job Chez Chen! Besides, the service is quick and very nice too!"}
{"text":"????? ??????????????????????? Personally I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in downtown Montreal. I give it a better rating than Ritz-Carleton and other high-end French dinings. Surprised and amazed and blessed to find this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really authentic chinese restaurant, not the kind that makes western chinese food. A lot of what they offer on their menu cannot be found easily in other chinese restaurant as they offer really authentic northern chinese food.  They restaurant is pretty small and it gets packed easily, so if you are a big group of people and you don't want to wait, then you better make a reservation.  I ordered ??????? (eggplant and japanese tofu) and I loved the eggplants in it: soft and juicy in the inside and the outside has a little sofy crisp. However the tofu was really bad, the tofu skin tasted really powdery...  The ??? (similar to a small spicy fish hotpot) was probably the best dish of the meal. Never had fish like that before. They serve you with tofu and some vegetables to go with the fish stew, a bit like a hotpot concept.   The ??? (porc coated with sweet sauce) was too sweet imo, and I always thought ??? was porc coated with flour and fried though...  We also ordered a new dish of their menu: ????? (tofu and porc blood in bamboo). There was barely any porc blood, but it tasted okay.   The servings are just average. It is a nice restaurant, and their menu is huge so I guess I will be back to try some other dishes"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Not the worst northern Chinese food I've had, but not the best either.   Restaurant is clean and bright with friendly servers. The moment I sat down they brought me a mug of complimentary tea which I thought was nice. This place is not fancy at all though, white metal chairs and lots of people in sweats. Would be good for a hungover meal!   I started with some wonton soup. The wontons themselves were very mediocre, but I thought the broth had nice flavor and the shaved cucumber in it was an interesting touch. I also had shanghai noodles, green beans with minced pork, and sautéed lamb on a sizzling hot plate.   I ordered vegetarian noodles as I had two meat dishes and they were disappointing. Very bland, and apparently \"with vegetables\" means three pieces of bok choi for the whole dish. Green beans were tasty, although I found the pork that was with them to be dry and not seasoned well. The lamb had solid flavor, this was probably my favourite dish.   Even though I didn't love all of the dishes that I ordered, I would come back again because it was a pleasant dining experience and there were a few more things on the menu that I would like to try!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot on Valentine's Day night. Surprisingly, most of other decent downtown restaurants were closed by 10pm on a Saturday night. This one closes late at 11pm, which, in my opinion, fits well with the schedule and life style of the downtown community.   Hot tea was immediately served once we sat down, with two appetizers: both, of course, home made. One of them is some crispy snack. Traditional Chinese style equivalent of nacho/chips. Taste was amazing, with the right amount of spices.   We ordered a traditional DongBei stew: pork ribs, flat bean and potatoes. It's exactly how authentic DongBei cuisine tastes like. I was very surprised and impressed by both the quantity and quality of it.  Honest ingredients and cooking. On the menu, you will find a lot of other DongBei cuisine options with very good price.   The decor is different than your typical Chinese restaurants, with bright orange paint, open kitchen concept, feels very clean and open sitting inside. A larger TV on the wall, and most importantly, it's NOT playing Chinese drama or boring news. They were playing hockey that night when we were there.   The staff were all very friendly and took care of our table w/o being overbearing.   I'd definitely go back to try out more food!"}
{"text":"Real classy place. Offered tea or water immediately upon being seated along with a quick home-style appetizer. The dishes are prepared in an open kitchen and while it takes time, you appreciate it because it is fresh. The batter on the general tao was fresh and the sauce for the Shanghai noodles was not laden with sodium and rich in flavour. The best part about this restaurant is its clean, bright and friendly. My personal favourite is the open kitchen where you can see your food being made. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and palatable restaurant. Definitely worth a visit! Order the lamb and also the fish!"}
{"text":"Chez Chen offers a diverse range of dishes from northern China. The prices are fair for the portions and you will find yourself indulging in many unique dishes that are not found in typical Chinese diners. They offer a discount when you pay in cash, and also give out free drinks when you spend over a certain amount. For sure one of my favourite places to go for some comfort food"}
{"text":"A small and cozy restaurant. They offer Chinese northeast cuisine and also some Sichuan dishes. We go here and meet friends regularly.  Last time we had five dishes, and we like them all, big portion and very tasty . However, sometimes the quality of dishes falls to stay the same.  I recommend spicy chicken, fish in a hot pot, cumin lamb, pickled cabbage pork stew, jelly noodle salad and sour&spicy potato slice (here are the Chinese names in case you know some ??? ??? ???? ????? ???? ?????? It can get very busy in the weekends. They also have delivery service and special lunch menu."}
{"text":"Another very authentic northern Chinese food. It's not a place where you want to go for hot and sour soup, general tao chicken or orange beef.   Here are my suggestions, orange sauce pork chop is something very similar general tao. It's  sour and little bit sweet.   Spicy fried beans, very tasty, goes very well with rice.   On a side note, you get free drinks when you order $50 or over."}
{"text":"I was tipped off to this place by a Chinese friend, who was surprised by how authentic and awesome the food was here. I ordered the crispy pork with sweet and sour sauce at her recommendation, and szechuan green beans with minced pork, as I was in the mood for something spicy. Both were delicious and came in a very generous portion. They offered us complimentary appetizer as well, which was spicy Edamame stir fried with some other vegetables (sorry can't recall, but it was darn good). Overall the cuisine here is more on the spicy side, so if you like that, that's good. Otherwise ask the server to make it less spicy for you."}
{"text":"This place is my newfound casual Chinese go-to restaurant. The service is extremely fast, the portions are big and it's not too salty or greasy and the price is right. It's not fancy at all, but for a quick weeknight meal, it is perfect. Also, they serve quite  few northern Chinese dishes that can't be found in other restaurants."}
