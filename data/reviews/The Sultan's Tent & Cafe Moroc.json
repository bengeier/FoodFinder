{"text":"Amazing fun place to go for any celebration! Great menu and vibe."}
{"text":"I went last night with a few friends. Ratings per below:

Belly dance - actually deserves a 4 star, the dance was so good, AND pretty and friendly, I would give her a tip if there's a choice. Note we only had 1 dancer for about 40 min, I heard there were supoosed to be more than 1... well. 

Food - deserves a 2.5 star... we used the coupon from travelzoo so we didn't oder anything that has additional charges to them, they may taste better but if that's the case, I would give this place a 1 star just because i would feel scammed

Harira - good soup, might be spicy for some. but i felt like they just got this from the beef stew and added water and some spices...

Maftoul - very good, my favorite couse, sauce on it was amzing, and the actual roll was crunchy enough

Beef short ribs - when it was brought to me, i thought omg this looks so delicisous, the meat falls right off the bone and the mashed potato has the golden colour to it. but after one bit, beef was so dry, and potato was too cold and hard for my like. i had less than 1/2 and couldn't finish it.

Moroc treat - 0 star dessert!! this was the worst of it all, what a joke, with two slices of oranges and two pieces of super sweet (not in a good way) marshmallow looking candies...

I do like their Mint tea...


Services - our waiter was so unfriendly, and i wasn't even sure if he's just been cool or mean?... he didn't do anything bad, it's more like he didn't do anything. and i can't believe the 15% gratitute was mandatory, i guess they know their service isn't the greatest so if it's not mandatory, not many people is willing to give much. and the 15% was on top of the full price (pre coupon), it doesn't make sense because i wouldn't come here if i'm paying the full price. 

this is my longest review so far and i hate to do this for a 2 star place, but felt like i have to... for the benefit of curious georges out there."}
{"text":"We went here in February of 2012 and let me start off with the fact that we were pretty excited! 

The first incident was, my friend that was with us found plastic in her mashed potatoes. At least they dealt with it there and then, like they should. 

My fiance ended up having the salmon for the 2nd course and got the WORST food poisoning EVER. 

I called to complain on his behalf the next day, and was told the manager was not in but they would call me back the next day. I never received that call back. 

My food was pretty good (I don't eat seafood) and the entertainment was nice, the atmosphere was very cool. 

But, food poisoning and finding foreign objects in your food kind of makes you wary of ever eating somewhere again..."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience and decor, which is the main appeal.  The waiter provided only prix fix menus (3 courses). When we asked why, he removed these and (reluctantly?) gave us a la carte menus, not all of us wanted 3 courses.
The crab cake was good but the salad garnish was oil-soaked. The chickpea tajine was dry and surprisingly bland.  The chicken peri peri was only moderately spicy, and came with mashed potatoes. Desserts looked good.
While the waiters were less than enthusiastic, the belly dancer was delightful and charming."}
{"text":"This place does not know what customer service is. I had reservations for Valentine's Day, called and confirmed with the manager, only to find out the manager never made the reservation. I repeatedly called the place to talk to the manager, who seldom returned my calls. He did apologize for failing to make the reservation and offered to book the downstairs (Berber) for myself and my date. However, on the day of, I get a phone call notifying me I have an additional $1,000 to pay for the \"special booking.\" I should have found another place a long time ago, this place is useless."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious Lunch Menu.
Tried the 
HARIRA - not bad, soup temperature was good,expected it to be more
spicy or tomato like but was actual very light
MAFTOUL  - pretty much a spring roll, but thinner shaped like a cigarette (for some reason expected it to be a fat cigar shape)
MANGO SALMON  - was salmon (felt like every other salmon dish)
maybe needed more mango (didn't taste it)
MOROC STEAK BAGUETTE - (did not try) but saw that the fries were really burnt 
MOROCCAN TREATS - Strangely the orange slices felt more like a candied version, a bit hard and chewy not like the description of fresh orange slices
BAKLAVA - hard and chewy
Both deserts felt like they were a bit stale.
Sat at the back, nice decor."}
{"text":"So pretty and the food was great! I loved the chiffon curtains and decor, it was really nice. My boyfriend and I went here a week ago and it was delish! We did the four course menu and I was soooo full afterwards. I had the harira, rolled chicken pastry things, salmon and a flourless chocolate torte. The harira is incredible, I could eat it everyday. The dessert was incredibly rich and I only had a couple bites. Overall it was great!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and the show is fantastic. One of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"We went here for a work holiday party.  The seating area was a bit odd and when the \"show\" began those of us sitting with our backs to the action had to crane our necks to see.  The music was pretty loud for just two girls dancing.  It was actually difficult to communicate with my fellow diners and the wait staff who continued to serve us through the show.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and didn't try to upsell us.  Upsell you say? Well although the menu indicates a prix fixe, there are various and numerous items that require the payment of an additional amount which can be up to $9.95 on the third course.  I think the minimum additional payment was $3.95.  Although you might not order anything that requires additional payment, you could end up paying an additional amount on each of the four courses which would increase your costs significantly and unexpectedly if you weren't paying attention.  
The food itself was flavourful, yummy and abundant.  I would go back if someone else was paying (again)."}
{"text":"I went once ate in this restaurant when I was in TO. It is super expensive, and specialties that are not Moroccan. But it's good. One thing I did not like: We were a small group of French, and the service was added automatically on the invoice. It is not in use, normally, it is the customer who decides the amount of the tip. You can dance inside. The decor is nice. If you can afford to pay you this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was one of those places that I never really bothered checking out since it seemed more like a tourist trap but figured I try it out since it's been there ever since I could remember.  I assumed it couldn't be that bad.  Walking in I was greeted by the hostess and advised that my friend made reservations.  She didn't have it on list so she went to the second hostess further in (I guess they have a 2nd one for the 'Tent' area...?) Anyway, after a bit of confusion they found my reservation and were seated by the window.  Service was prompt - we got our food very quickly.
Food was a downer.  I had the Cous Cous Royale that comes with a bed of couscous with pomegranate glazed chicken, three spicy merguez sausages, grilled lamb and root vegetables.  The chicken tasted a bit dry and didn't taste the glaze at all.  It actually looked like there wasn't glaze on it at all.  The sausages and lamb were also on the dry side.  Everything was lacklustre but the waitress was nice and let my friend and I catch up long after we settled the bill (though the cafe area was pretty empty).  
I can't say that I was disappointed since I was somewhat expecting a mediocre meal...just wished I was proven wrong."}
{"text":"This place is hilarious! 

When walking into the restaurant, it feels like you are transported to Morocco! The seating areas are little nooks perfect for a date. There were some large parties that looked like they were having a hoot!

Our waitress looked like Kristen Wiig (I'm NOT kidding, we heard the other table tell her that & she seemed exhausted by the reference.) She was very nice, attentive and explained the menu etc. 

I ordered the fish which was good but nothing really to write home about. The beef was apparently quite good. The chicken dish was so huge that my friend has to take it home. The food was 'safe' Moroccan food but still very flavourful.   

The show was fun and the dancer didn't pressure us into dancing which was nice.

**It is worth noting that the Prix Fix menu does not include upgrades. Everything that we wanted was an additional fee. This is worth noting for when your bill comes, those little charges really add up**"}
{"text":"We totally enjoyed the meal, ambiance, and entertainment. We shared our meals so we could taste a little of everything.
The salad was tasty and fresh, and the dressing was not overpowering. The Chèvre brûlée and hummus were our second courses, and they were very tasty. We especially liked the chèvre brûlée and the jam that came with it. A very rich combination of sweet and salty. 
The braised Lamb meal was fabulous and the meat fell right off the bone. We also had the salmon, which was tasty as well, but I must say is was a tinge on the dry side.  That is a minor complaint, if you are a salmon fan - go for it!

The crime brûlée for dessert was good as was the carrot cake. The carrot cake is different than you would expect, slightly on the heavy side, still acceptable.

Go and enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Went once for my birthday.  What a weird place.  Took a while to get seated despite it being relatively empty.  Discovered that to sit in the themed tent area you need to order the pre-set menu."}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner in the early evening. Waited approximately 20 minutes to receive proper menus, after deciding to forego the Summerlicious prix-fixe menus. Waited nearly about hour after finishing our meals for the bill. Though our table was on the main thoroughfare of the restaurant, our server was seemingly actively ignoring my table. None of the servers were cheerful, and indeed it seemed some were participating in heated exchanges in the kitchen, as seen through the kitchen doors.

Our table, the dishes, silverware, and decor were all covered in varying levels of muck, that was readily apparent by sight or touch. Restaurant is rather dimly lit, with too many pillows, curtains, and other decorations strewn about. Our table featured a severe wobble and nearly resulted in spilled drinks multiple times. 

Dishes came out in reasonable time, tasted okay, and were an acceptable size. Altogether not worth the hefty price asked."}
{"text":"I selected this place for my wife's 40th birthday. I would give the ambiance a 10, you definitely feel like you're in an exotic locale, and not a restaurant in downtown Toronto. I would say the belly dancing is more of a gimmick, rather than true artful entertainment. Maybe it was just the dancer that night, but she seemed to be just going through the motions, and not really into what she was doing. She kept talking during her performance to patrons, making for awkward engagements. 

The food overall was OK, not great. After dinner our party exchanged comments on the food, and most of us agreed the food was cooked, and presented perfectly. Where most of the food was lacking was in the flavor, Everyone complained the main courses were quite bland. Only the appetizers had flavor, and mainly the Maftoul. Because of the above pricing I don't think I would give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, amazing atmosphere. I tried the cafe during summerlicious last summer and went back this year and got to sit in the back!!

The only downside was the it took a very long time for the food to arrive, but the quality was excellent."}
{"text":"I went for summerlicious lunch menu and I am glad that I did not pay more than 15$. I started with the Fekkous salad which was basically apples, onions, tomatoes and cucumber chopped really small with chickpeas. I could not taste the salad dressing. So if I am at a restaurant and I eat something that I could make better at home....thats never a good sign.

I went on to the burger which I had sans bun (gluten allergy). The burger itself was a nice surprise. It was juicy and flavorful. However it came with nothing. No tomatoes, no onions, no condiments. Just all on its own. I doubt thats how they serve it with the bun. The side salad was spinach and bell peppers and cucumber. Not very Moroccan feeling nor was it very tasty. Again, I could have made this at home.

I initially ordered rice pudding for dessert and unfortunately they ran out so I got the Moroccan cookies which were tiny and just plainly tasted only like sugar. My friends had the brulee which was much better.

Basically, I could have recreated this meal at home so I wouldn't come back. Service was good."}
{"text":"Place was dead. Food was mediocre. Seating was uncomfortable and awkward. Our waitress was nice, the person delivery the food needs to be more friendly and not slam the plates down of food. Belly dancing was amusing for the first 30 seconds. Then it became gimmicky. Wine selection was poor and overpriced. Service was slow at times. Seems like this place doesn't put in a good effort as they feel the business will always come being that they are on front street. They are not looking for the return visits. Just looking to take the tourist money once and that's it. Best part of the night was the company we were with. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both for birthday parties, and would not have come otherwise.

The place has a great mysterious ambience. It feels like you've been transported to some otherwordly place. The service was great and the food was delicious yet unfulfilling as I was still hungry afterwards. As for the belly dancing, how great was that? Good food and belly dancing, where else in the city can you get that combo?

Food: 4
Service: 4
Ambience: 10+++
Belly Dancing: 10+++
Overall: 4 of 5 stars (although I would only visit for birthdays or special occasions)"}
{"text":"I recently came here my birthday lunch. I'll start off by saying that my meal was absolutely delicious. I ordered the chickpea salad with steak and was smacking my lips the entire time. Very unique flavouring, I really enjoyed it. 

My mother ordered the quinoa salad with chicken and was extremely disappointed. Instead of chicken breast, she received a rather tiny portion of chicken thigh and she didn't care for the way the quinoa was prepared. 

I have to say, the menu seems like it could use a bit of a reboot. Some of the options were just kind of meh (and prices are definitely not cheap).  I've been to Sultan's Tent and night and its obviously a completely different experience than the daytime restaurant but I feel as if its really lacking an authentic feel in the service. Yes, the restaurant is beautifully decorated. But it would be nice to be served a complimentary Moroccan appetizer or something of the sort. 

Staff very courteous and professional."}
{"text":"WARNING: Beware!! My cell phone was stolen from my coat pocket while the coat was given to restaurant staff for hanging in coat closet."}
{"text":"Very Moroccan. Heading to morocco this year and this resto got me excited about the trip already. Beautiful place."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this restaurant for a different experience and it did provide that, and also had a great ambience as so many other reviews pointed out. The customer service was good for my experience but I can tell it could easily slip as the communication between their staff was so-so. 

The food was average and they didn't really explain via their website, or up front when you get there that it's a fixed price menu on the weekend, it was only after I asked why is there not any prices next to the food. 

The price of the food was a bit steep for the quality of food and are probably just playing more for the \"belly dancer\" show, which I would admit was entertaining for sure, which last about 15mins.

So if you're thinking about this place its really just a one time place that you should check out but it won't leave a lasting memory that you can't stop talking about."}
{"text":"This place was just all around awful. Super gimmicky and tacky with awful food. I had the chicken tagine and it tasted like no frills quality meat boiled in cinnamon water. It was obvious that it hadn't been cooked in the tagine as the tagine was stone cold when it came out. My partner had the lamb tagine and it was no better. It tasted like it had been made a week prior and microwaved. 

The starter was their \"signature maftoul\" which was beyond strange. It was beef wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper smothered in a heavy chipotle mayo--nothing morrocan about it. It had no redeeming qualities. My girlfriend had the hummus which wasn't too bad and came with really tasty olives.

Dessert for me was a lemon tart that looked and tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck. My partner had a watermelon salad that was soaked in an ungodly amount rose water with pieces of melon rind in it. 

To top it all off there was awkward belly dancing through the whole meal. I'm not super keen on having someone belly dance right in front of me while I'm trying to eat but maybe I'm weird. Had I known there was a \"show\" I never would have came here. The only thing I'll give credit for is that our server was great. Since he never asked how the food was I assume he knows it's terrible. This is bar none the worst meal I've had in Toronto and it cost me $150."}
{"text":"First time eating at Cafe Moroc and everything was fabulous.  Jennifer, our server, was very friendly and informative.  She and the hostess both answered questions about the menu and the house favorites.  I had the Maftoul to start followed by The Braised Lamb Feast.  Both were flavorful and presented well.  The lamb was perfect, falling off the bone, you waved a knife in the direction of the meat and it cut itself.  Fortunately I saved room for dessert and I was quite pleased with the Sweet Keskesku.  Jennifer asked the manager to stop by and Medhat Lotfy regaled us with stories of his background and the adventure he had styling the Cafe Moroc and The Sultan's Tent as well as the Berber in authentic Moroccan decor.  The Sultan's Tent is the large seating area in the rear with the Prix Fixe menu with multiple choices that has several evening seatings.  The Berber is the elegant and intimate bar - restaurant in the basement.  We will return again soon!"}
{"text":"A French Moroccan restaurant in downtown Toronto, the Sultan's Tent & Cafe Moroc is so much more than just a restaurant. While the front entrance doesn't scream out at you when you walk past (and is therefore easy to miss) the internal decor is stunning. Customers sit in tents on seats that are covered in traditional rolled cushions. The tables look as if they've come straight from the North Africa as do the linens and lamps.
If sitting in the back portion of the restaurant customers choose from a fixed price menu of four courses starting at $50.00 (including gratuity and taxes). The food itself was not out of this world, but the experience more than made up for it. The staff are wonderful and very adept at handling large groups. 
If you're looking at going somewhere with a large group (we went for my sister's post wedding party) then this is a good choice. Also try and get in for the belly dancing. Seating times are quite rigid because of the dancing shows, and they will ask you to leave if another party is due to come in (they give you a three hour time slot - more than enough to eat your food!)."}
{"text":"I went for the winterlicious lunch deal.
Good things : good price, nice ambience, relaxed atmosphere, not rushed...i had gone with my girlfriends and we got ample time to catch up and eat.
There were no bad things, but the food was OK, tried the grilled veggie pita wrap - OK in terms of flavour, too mellow for me, however the appetizer - maftoul cigars were very good and the dessert - creme brulee was good, not wowie but good enough. 
 Would def like to come back in evening sometime to check out their belly dancing and Maybe try some stuff from their regular menu which hopefully is more flavourful in their spices."}
{"text":"Did the whole 4 Course Dinner & Dance. Food was delicious & the Belly Dancers were alright. Great place to go once every 3 years or so since there is really nothing that special to the Belly Dancers."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decor and food was great. The live entertainment kicked it up a notch. Great date restaurant"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday there and absolutely loved the food and the belly dancers. The service was welcoming and the atmosphere was perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"I went to sultan's tent for as part of a bachelorette party.  We booked a large table under one of the tented areas.  The decorations were traditional and you get a feel for the atmosphere immediately.

We had to order off the price fixe menu since we were a large group.  It's $40, but then if you want to order \"premium\" items, then you have to add extra costs per dish. There aren't very many choices for the \"non-premium\" items.  I ordered the sliced smoked duck salad (add an extra $4.95); the samak saghir (which reminded me of a moroccan form of spring rolls); the braised lamb (delicious, meat was tender and fell right off the bone); moroccan treats (cookies and orange slices only because I didn't want to pay more for a premium dish).

Once the show comes on, the lights are dimmed, so I couldn't see my meal at all.  I had to take a picture with flash, so I could see what I was eating and know where to cut my meat!   That was a challenge.  The belly dancing was a good show and very interactive as the dancers float from table to table. I felt quite foolish trying, but hey, I'm only going to experience this once, I think!  We had the 8 o'clock show, so we had to be out by 10pm for the next show.   

Overall, it's fun, but pricey. It's a place that I'd recommend as something special to do or just to try once.  Otherwise, it's pretty expensive."}
{"text":"This place is a bit hit and miss when it comes to accommodation -- it depends on who's in the kitchen. The first time I went, they refused to do any accommodation whatsoever. We left without food.

We tried again a year later, and had some luck. I was pretty much stuck with my \"chef is playing it cautious\" fallback -- plain steak and unseasoned steamed vegetables. Certainly edible and filling, though nothing I couldn't do myself, but I got to eat something while my dinner companions enjoyed a place they loved . Had that a few times.

But the last time I went, it was the absolute best accommodation experience I have ever had at any restaurant, period. We went for my mother's birthday and it happened to be during Summerlicious, and they had a set menu. I couldn't have anything on the set menu, and was prepared to just enjoy mom's company and eat when I got home. But the chef, who was the regular chef for the Berber Lounge downstairs, took my restrictions as a challenge, and came up with the most delicious meal I have ever had. 

The measure of the true difference between a cook and a chef is how they're able to work around my restrictions, and the chef they had that night was absolutely world-class. 

Call ahead if you have restrictions, just to check and make sure they can accommodate you."}
{"text":"Once you walk in this restaurant, you can feel the authenticity of a Morocco. The atmosphere is very lovely and the staff are friendly to boot.I know hospitality is an important aspect of Moroccan culture. Anywho, I ordered harira as an appetizer which was very light--the lemon adds a refreshing taste. Next, I ordered the mango salmon which was very filling. Another thing I should mention, the waiter pours the tea up high(which supposedly adds to the flavour of the tea). Quite interesting. All in all, its a perfect place to impress your date. A bit pricey but worth the meal and service."}
{"text":"The best part of this experience was the dancers and creme-brulee. The main entrées was an insult to authentic middle Eastern and fine dining. I had the lamb and peri peri chicken, neither of which exemplified exotic and robust flavours. You can tell the food was under a hot plate for some time. Disappointed for the price."}
{"text":"We were initially a bit put off by how slow the restaurant was to reply to messages left requesting reservations, but after two days' wait, we finally got our table for six. The place is beautiful, no doubt. The decor is lovely and warm, and looks like a place equally suited to dates or group events. Upon being seated, we were handed our drink and a la carte menus, with no mention of the prix fixe option. When the server returned several minutes later, she gave us the prix fixe menus.  We did end up with a la carte.  The maftouls were very tasty starters.  Which is good, because they had to hold us over for another 45 minutes until the entrees arrived.  Yes, the service was very, very distracted and amateurish. Our server disappeared for extended periods and studiously avoided all eye contact.  Five of the six entrees finally arrived, but it was another several minutes before the last one arrived - a big peeve of mine. Several people sitting around politely waiting for one hungry person's entree.  Unfortunately, much of it wasn't worth waiting for. The cote de boeuf was an absolute abomination. Coarse, irregular slices covered in sloppy grillmarks, cooked far, far, far beyond the medium-rare ordered. A half-hearted offer was made to replace it, but having waited the better part of an hour, my friend wasn't inclined to sit there again while the rest of us ate.  The osso bucco tagine was quite tasty, though the meat was a bit tough and so much of the liquid had evaporated that a lot of the meat and veggies were crusted to the tagine itself.  The server had recommended a side starch for the juices, so I ordered Basmati rice. It was unnecessary, as there were no juices, but it was just as well, since we got badly-cooked saffron rice instead.  Mushy and bland.  The lamb shanks were generally enjoyed, though. They looked lovely and were tender and tasty.  We decided to have the coconut rice pudding for dessert. It was the same mushy rice (though not saffron!), decorated with tasty merengue-like crisps and an unfortunate flavorless, watery foam. Absolutely not worth nine dollars, despite the attractive presentation.  All in all, The Sultan's Tent gave the illusion of being a beautiful concept without the professional skills - cooking and service - to back it up. If it was a freshly-opened restaurant, I'd give it another chance, but it's been open long enough that it's likely settled into this quality level."}
{"text":"Order the 4-course selection and you'll be seated back in the \"tents\" with the belly dancing shows. The service was great, food was very good...the soup as the first course is a must. Tea service at end of meal! A great find in Toronto!"}
{"text":"2 out of 5! Entertaining and fun to watch belly dancing but did not like the food! I would not recommend this place for birthdays either"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, lunch and dinner.  The dinner (with belly dancing) can be quite entertaining and it's an experience.  The food is average but service is friendly.  I'd go again but wouldn't kill to go again!"}
{"text":"So bad.  I'm a native from Morocco and this reminded me of a fast food chain that overcooked everything to well done.  But it wasn't \"well done\" it was horrible and disgusting.  The prices were also extremely expensive for the poor quality and poor service. Avoid like the plague..."}
{"text":"Well what can I say. I arrived at 9pm for a celebratory new year's eve meal. 3 hours later and we have yet to be served our main courses. While the appetizers were quite good, the wait time is simply unacceptable. Hopefully my meal will arrive before 2017."}
{"text":"We went here for a C Nigro's bridal shower.  The food was cold for the most part. The chicken did not taste like anything.   There was very little 

The overall ambiance is ok however I would not recommend this place to anyone given the quality of the food.   The location is also difficult to get to and of course you have to pay for parking (typical downtown though)"}
{"text":"Loved every minute of it! Starting from the unique decor, with draped colourful fabrics to create a tent feel, to the belly dancing and the tea. The service was good and all of our food was very flavourful and well-presented. I also absolutely loved their crème brûlée. Can't wait to go back! It was a great date night."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday party. Ambience is lovely, belly dancing was decent, however the food was absolutely awful. Overpriced and two of my friends, who both ordered the seafood paella could not stop throwing up after the meal. When we went to speak to the manager, she was skeptical about the matter. Even after watching my sick friend run back and forth to the washroom to vomit, she insisted that it couldn't have been the food because \"food poisoning usually happens after a few hours.\" Being a med student, I knew that this wasn't the case, and it could happen as early as half an hour after the meal. She then tried to brush us off with an apology and ginger ale. My sick friend, however, was furious, as our bill was well over $500. Eventually, after a lot of back and forth, the restaurant refunded our bill, and we only paid for the alcohol. Needless to say, we will never be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good table d'hôte! Ambience was cool, belly dancing not very authentic."}
{"text":"This was an awesome summerlicious pick for lunch. I'd never been before and the ambience itself is fantastic! The food was delicious and I was actually full after eating a summerlicious meal. I had the chick pea salad as an app, for the main I had the lamb, chicken and shrimp skewers and for dessert I had the crème brule. Everything was delicious though my lamb was a bit too well done for my liking. The service was excellent as well. Worth the price for the food and the experience"}
{"text":"As a business owner myself , I listen to my reviews etc from customers. This place should too before its too late for them , The 1 star reviews are mounting and sooner or later it does have an affect on the business. 
The front line staff is important , they set the mood for the evening. The tall hostess with the loud shoes....clunk clunk clunk back and forth during our meal was unbearable at times. You could hear her from the bathroom !! But lets move onto the rest of the place. The setting is very comforting and you look forward to a great experience which this place does not deliver. Slow to greet you at the table and take your drink order . We already knew the prices were fixed and we were fine with that . What we were not fine with was the quality. As other reviews state \"bland\" is the best way to describe it. Perhaps the great decor as seen through our eyes gave our mouth the wrong expectation. Location of restaurant dictates that they have to charge the unjust price of $55 per person. Music good ...belly dancers good. 

One thing the management should explain here to future readers and potential patrons. If we book our reservations online, get a confirmation in our mail with the details etc,,,,,why is it necessary to call Guest Services to confirm the reservations ? Do you not trust your reservation system ? This didn't bother me at first but after the let down of the meal etc it just added more fuel to the fire to downgrade this place. 

Upon confirmation of our reservations we were told that we had 2 hrs and 20 minutes to enjoy ourselves..... We were  wondering why people were walking out within and hour and now we know. This place will get the people looking for that great experience of Morocco but will not have return guests. 

One last thing....its a small thing but helps . As your guests are leaving and passing by the hostess .....the hostess should acknowledge ...\"hey this was a customer that just spent some money here....maybe I should stop talking to the other hostess and say \"Thank you for coming\" 2 seconds out of your conversation and it would help a lot...Oh by the way...clunk clunk clunk..."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience here. This was a special day and I was celebrating with my friends, our reservation was for 8.30PM (for the 9PM show). We only got to our table at 8.50PM... no one came to us for another 20 minutes to take any sorts of order... that's already very late for dinner and they were just delaying it more. I have signed up for a special Pri fix menu package, and had called 3 times in the week before the actual night of the reservation. They confirmed over the phone everytime that they will have everything ready but we still got nothing... we were told the package includes cake, macaroons and coin belts for all the ladies... and nothing... the show started late as well... plus we got our food by 10PM and by then people were starving!!!! It was horrible... food was good though, but they really didn't make up for anything. I would say if you're going there for dinner... great, but do not waste a special evening there!"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst food I have ever had served to me in my life. I think one of the other reviewers said it best when they described the food as if it had been sitting under a buffet lamp all day long. It did not taste fresh at all it was incredibly bland. 

Instead of crispy and flaky, the \"Moroccan Cigars\" were hard and greasy with some sort of bland spiced-mayo drizzled on top. No flavour whatsoever. For my main dish I had the Casblanca Couscous which was supposed to be couscous in a curry sauce with roasted root vegetables. What arrived was astonishingly bad. Instead of being fluffy and light, the couscous was a giant, hard softball in the middle of my plate. Instead of a curry sauce, it was ketchup. I am not kidding. I am 100% positive it was ketchup. The roasted root vegetables consisted of one piece of raw parsnip, two pieces of burnt red pepper and two pieces of the saddest looking, soggy zucchini I have ever seen in my life. 

Yes, the decor is well done.
Yes, the belly dancing is fun, but there is only one woman performing and half the time you can't even see her. 

I have no idea why it gets such great reviews. Maybe the food used to be good. It is TERRIBLE and not worth $10 let alone the $40 starting price."}
{"text":"I will give this place credit for being unique. The decor was very nice, and the seating cozy and intimate. The service was very friendly and attentive. Our waiter was very personable and helpful with the menu. The staff were also very carefully attentive to my nut allergy (there were nuts everywhere on the menu). The belly dancing was fairly entertaining.

However the food was sub par. It was mostly lacking any flavour or spice. I think they tone it down for the average person. The waiter offered some hot sauce if we felt the food too bland and I wish I had taken him up on it. I had the short rib for my 3rd course and it was prepared very well, just bland. The featured beer was Estrella from Barcelona and i liked that it came in a tall can.

I found it not really good value either. $40 for a four course meal sounds like a decent deal but it quickly adds up if you order items that are of additional cost.

Overall, maybe worth trying once for the experience."}
{"text":"We tried the Winterlicious dinner menu. The appetizers were hot and quite good, the main   was served in clay bowl on cork pads (as though the bowls should be hot and serve as table protectors), the meal was not hot and not very flavourful. The dessert was taken from the fridge and not conditioned for the right amount of time. It was a displeasing temperature. I found this restaurant to be very expensive and not very creative. 
The belly dancer put on an okay show and engaged well with guests, the Moroccan coffee was delicious!
I felt this experience was a lost opportunity as we tried this restaurant for the first time because of the Winterlicious advertising, but will not return."}
{"text":"Fun place, a bit pricey but it's more of an experience than a restaurant. Has belly dancing occasionally throughout the day but if you're not in the back room you won't see it"}
{"text":"Food was poor and service was mediocre... Don't understand the staff, they can do a lot better but barely saw them while we ate. The chocolate tart thing is something you'd buy at Starbucks for 3 dollars...very dissatisfied with performance and product. Will not go again."}
{"text":"I had great expectations from this place, but it was bit of a let down. Having lived in the Middle East, my standards were probably set too high. 
This place was decorated with mediocre taste (worn out and faded decor) and seriously lacked one defining element that one would associate with a middle eastern household/restaurant. ..the beautiful smells of \"oud\" or middle eastern incense/perfume! However, we were pleasantly surprised by the belly dance show, which was quite good! Loved the way the dancer interacted with the audience!
Service was good.. No complaints there. 

Food however was seriously lacking in flavour. Good portion size of the main entree,  but it was too salty even without the olives. We had the vegetable tangine. I was disappointed that they make you pay for essential sides like the couscous..it's like serving the pasta sauce as main entree and paying for the pasta itself! Moreover, i though the prices are very high! Won't be back here again..!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Price of the meal was $40 per person (there were many other options which had an additional charge). Having been here twice, I highly recommend the following meal if you have no idea what to order.

First Course: Harira (a type of vegetable soup)
Second Course: Maftoul (savoury spring roll). Hummus with Pita was also good. Boeuf Bourguinon was decent but not worth the extra charge. I would 100% order the Maftoul again.
Third Course: Rack of Lamb. Our group of 10 ordered a large variety of the Third Course and none were very impressive. If I were to go again, I'd try the Rack of Lamb.
Fourth Course: Chocolate Oasis (similar to a chocolate brownie lava cake). I did not like the cinnamon-y Moroccan treats. Creme Brulee was okay, but I did not think it was worth the extra.

Facility: Located right on Front St (a one way road), street parking is hard to find if you are getting there after 6pm. Be prepared to wait a while or park further away (neither is good if it's raining). About $3 per hour on weekends up to 9pm (free after 9). The Sultan's Tent has lovely decor (though I'm not sure how authentic or culturally sensitive it is, but it definitely gets points for being romantic. Washrooms are clean but need to be checked more often (empty toilet paper rolls) etc. Overall, decent sight lines but hard to get in and out of the large banquet seats if you have  a big party. 

Service: Pre-booking/reservation was an unreliable system. Upon calling to book for the Sultan's Tent, we were told that 7pm was not available. Instead, I was given the choice of 5:30pm or 10pm. I opted for the 5:30. On arrival, I was told by the hostess that we were booked for Cafe Morroc (not the dinner show in the back). I asked how this problem could be solved and she said there was (thankfully) an opening at 7:30pm for our party of 10. Odd. So who ever took my booking never bothered to tell me that 7:30pm was an available time for the dinner show. 

All would have been fine and dandy, but I had to call all attendees to tell them to come 2 hours later (not a big deal).  But after my call, I heard the hostess complaining to her co-worker (in front of me) about us and our booking. IMO, highly unprofessional. 

So if you are making a reservation, CLARIFY if you are reserving for Cafe Morroc or the dinner show in the back \"Sultan's Tent\". Take this into your own hands because they will fumble the ball.

During dinner, our waiter (I think his name was Chris?) was just great. Charismatic and charming, he balanced our table well and everything went very smoothly from orders to billing. 

Belly dancer show was fun to watch. Two girls went up and down the aisles (I vaguely remember three girls the last time I came to Sultan's Tent) but nevertheless, they did not disappoint. Had a lot of fun when they dragged both of us birthday girls out to dance a bit. Hilariously mortifying but a lot of fun!

Overall: A fun, novel place to go for a birthday or a bachelorette. Don't go expecting great food, you are there for the experience. Don't think I would seek out to book/eat there again after having been twice already. But if a party was happening, I wouldn't mind going. Sultan's Tent needs to work on their booking process and some of their girls' professional training. Wait staff was great and the show was worth a look-see.

I rate Sultan's Tent a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"over hyped, over priced. If you're going for the novelty of the belly dancing find a different place with better food.

Dinner was mediocre (bordering on just plain bad). Food tasted like it was sitting in a buffet table tray all day and warmed up to be served. I think this place is a giant tourist trap for its novelty (atmosphere etc.)"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend on a weeknight. I had the Maftoul as an appetizer and the Moroccan Beef Ribs, both were good though nothing spectacular. The service was alright, and the décor was nice. We sat in the bar area (Café Moroc), but if you're into belly dance, they have a separate seating area for that."}
{"text":"More about the experience than the cuisine. A great Moroccan experience with belly dancing for entertainment. Not cheap and overall the food is not much more than okay. The quantity justifies the price. Word of advice: the light gets turned down during the show, which makes eating fattier cuts tricky if not impossible."}
{"text":"The food is really not very good at the Sultans Tent. This spot has beautiful, authentic decor and the bellydancers are great but the show is not good value given how tired and disappointing the food is.  It's not even authentic Moroccan! Peri peri chicken is Portuguese. Come on! 

For a starter, I had the harira soup (lentil) - it smelled very good but was very salty and really didn't taste like anything. And it had a ton of half-cooked lentils chickpeas. Who can eat crunchy soup? Not well done at all.

For a main, I had the Chicken Fez tagine -- this is a staple of Moroccan cuisine (slow-cooked chicken with olives and preserved lemons). It should have been fantastic because everyone and their dog knows how to make it...... but it was so salty and tasteless that I left 2/3 on my plate. And it had rice instead of couscous which surprised me. Not authentic either!

My friends said their meals were \"ok\" but not great.

Anyway. I hope they update the menu and improve the food considerably. It's a missed opportunity because the show is good and you can't beat the decor and location."}
{"text":"Nice belly dancing, great atmosphere. Food is so so. I felt so dehydrated after- very salty. Great for the experience but not the food part."}
{"text":"Fun for group! We had our company party here....the belly dancing was a hoot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and wasn't going to see the show, but our server was kind enough to check if there was room and they fit us in. 

Atmosphere and decor of this place is great, very romantic with a great morrocan feel to it.

The service was very quick, we got our food quickly. Had a bean soup, very tasty, and kulfta(?) cigars, basically beef springrolls, they were alright. Braised lamb was excellent, little light on the vegetables and sauce. Being from the restaurant industry, service wasn't top class, no preening or quality check, for the prices, but the food did come promptly.

The place really comes alive with the gorgeous belly dancers (they were twins too). People are clapping and up dancing. It was awesome! 

Bill came in at about $100 for 2. Overall would totally come back, great place."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst service I have seen in such a long time. I don't understand the concept of having dancers and fancy menu... When you can't serve the food and drinks on time.  There was a gap of 30 mins before the server would drop by in a rush to leave. Food was okay and the ambience was great... But the service was a big let down"}
{"text":"I went to The Sultan's Tent for a bachelorette party. 

Atmosphere:
This is a beautiful restaurant. You feel comfortable but also like you're in for a treat as soon as you enter. 

Service: 
We had a waitress as well as a waiter who was in training. The waitress seemed frustrated and was short with us. She didn't really ask us what we were celebrating or have any kind of conversation with us - just reminded us that there was a seating time limit before we had even placed our orders. The waiter in training seemed like a friendly guy and chatted with us a little bit, which made up for the fact that several of us felt like we had upset the waitress simply with our presence. Initially when I had made a reservation, a man on the phone told me he'd email me a contract and never did. Luckily, I called back and dealt with Angela, who made our initial reservation; she was really nice, prompt, and helpful. She might need to train some of the other staff. The belly dancers seemed really nice and were very entertaining. 

Food: 
The pre-fixe menu with three courses is not the best idea in my opinion. Plus, if you want some of the other things on the menu you have to add on to the fixed price. In fact, it ends up costing more to get the same food off of the pre-fixe menu in some cases. I understand that it's Friday or Saturday night but I don't think this gives the customer the best experience. 

I split everything with a friend so got to try the:
-Hummus - it was okay; nothing special 
-Moroccan Crab Cake - it tasted fresh but was disappointing in terms of seasoning
-Chevre Brûlée - the cheese was fresh and the caramelization on it was a nice touch; the crostini with it was really undersized, which I didn't mind but one of the girls really didn't enjoy  
-Seafood Royale - my friend and I agreed that this was one of the best seafood dishes we've ever had; everything was tender; the broth and rice were amazing. The only thing is that it is a big portion and once it starts cooling down it tastes a bit salty. But when it's warm it's amazing and tastes seasoned just right.  
-Rack of Lamb - the lamb was okay. We had to use our hands to eat it because the knives we had weren't doing the job. The honey and ginger worked well with it. The mashed potatoes and veggies it came with were probably the worst thing I'd had all night. I hate when restaurants don't focus on the basics.
-Chocolate Tart - this was good if you really like chocolate; it wasn't made in house though and they didn't know what was in it in terms of allergens, which makes no sense to me. Usually if something comes in from somewhere else it has a huge ingredients label on it somewhere. 
-Creme Brûlée - I didn't enjoy this; it was supposed to come with crushed pistachio - if it did, then you couldn't taste it or see it.

My friend - the bride-to-be - has allergies to eggs and nuts. Although I was assured on the phone that they would find something for her to eat for each of the three courses, when it came to dessert the waitress basically said, \"Sorry, every dessert has nuts or eggs in it. I'll get you a plate of assorted fruits.\" My friend was then given a plate of orange slices with some cinnamon sprinkled on them. This is not good service. Firstly, I was assured there would be something for her. Secondly, assorted means more than one kind of fruit. Thirdly, they should have at least deducted dessert off of her bill OR offered her the cheese appetizer which was more dessert-like and worth the price than a plate of sliced oranges. She was a good sport and is used to this kind of thing but the rest of us felt terrible. 

I would go back here on a night when I don't have to get the pre-fixe menu and just order the Seafood Royale - it was that good!"}
{"text":"A long over due review, last summer I attended a UYE at Sultan's Tent , arranged so graciously by Viviana M :)

From the Summerlicious menu I ordered for my main Short ribs - which were tender and fall off the bone, a Maftoul appetizer - deliciously crisp cigar shaped Moroccan like spring roll, and Creme Brule dessert  - nicely glaze. All dishes were done perfectly!

Service fell short though. No problem taking the orders at the beginning but our server disappeared on us half way through the meal after the food was delivered to the table. 

4 stars overall because the food was perfect and reasonable in cost with the Summerlicious deal."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Their (pricey) meal was 4 courses at a \"prix fix\" even though most dishes had an extra charge. I had: 

1. Salad - basically it was some leaves and instead of \"pomegranate vinaigrette\" it just tasted like a little bit of vinegar was added. My fellow restaurateurs thought the lentil soup was good though
2. Crab cakes - Worst crab cakes I've ever had. Period. 
3. Braised Lamb - It only comes as a Medium well option with couscous. The lamb was overcooked and the couscous was just couscous 
4. Brownie - this was the only part of the meal that wasn't appalling. It wasn't very good, but it was decent. The only course that I finished. 

As an arab, this place has great decor, but the food was horrendous and overpriced for what it was. If you want to spend $50-$60 on just food, go to the copacabanas of the world. For Arabic food, Tabule at Yonge and Eg is awesome. I would not spend $15 for what I ate. 

Awful, really just awful. I don't know how they stay in business if that is what they serve. None of the 12 people I went with had a good experience. 

Will not go back, ever. EVER."}
{"text":"I must say I was very disappointed! The chicken and lamb we ordered tasted like it was boiled over white rice without any flavour. Morocco has many diverse spices, but they seem to have run out or forgotten to throw them in. Hummus = zero taste. Dessert ( crème brûlée ) = way too sweet and tasted like it came out of a box. 
The waiter seemed un-interested as soon as we asked him for the a la carte menu and tried to up sell the already pricey $ 55 menu. He did not even ask us if everything was ok at the end of the meal though sadly our plates were still full of food! 
The belly dancers were nice but difficult to see as they only danced in the hallway mostly blocked by the pillars. The decor is nice but I would not go back or recommend The Sultans Tent as it is over-priced and over-rated for the prices you pay.
They really need to change the way they do business as they seem to get a lot of ratings that are 2 or below."}
{"text":"First off there was only one belly dancer who performed for a good 20 minutes and she spent most of her time at one end of the room dancing like she was extremely bored.  They probably have more on certain nights...I'm not sure but when we came in that's what happened...one bored dancer.

I ordered a Cesar for my drink which was a full $10, and took the soup which was a bland potato and carrot,  then followed by a bland hummus/pita/olive,  then a chicken marakesh which had these sweet apricots onions date couscous and grilled chicken and the flavor was just... Well if you like sweet and bland this is your dish. 

A few friends got the vegetarian stuffed eggplant but they had no eggplants so they gave her sliced veggies over mashed potatoes and she barely touched it... They looked and apparently tasted bland.  We really tried to enjoy it the staff was friendly even though she mixed up the bill at the end.  We also waited even though we called and booked for a table.  


I honestly wouldn't recommend this place if you want good food or entertainment.  If you wanna be adventurous... Sure.  But I won't go back again. All I'm hearing now is 'it was pricey and bland'  =("}
{"text":"Atmosphere, exotic, food quality and presentation superb. Service is excellent, drinks divine and belly dancer shaking. Bring a date, celebrate any occasion or group gathering.  A memorable place to host your event. Im a fan."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday night to start my best friends bachelorette party with dinner. We were a party of about 15 people and we had made reservations a few weeks before so we received a great, semi private area. There was more than enough room for all of us and the seating was very nice. We had a sheer curtain that we could pull closed to give us a little bit more privacy.

Our waitress was quick and extremely friendly. She did not seem overwhelmed with our party and was very professional. Our food and drinks came out fairly quickly and everything was delicious. I had the soup of the day, hummus and olives, short rib and tangerines with cinnamon for desert. I have a very serious tree nut allergy and everyone was very careful and flexible for me. 

The belly dancers were great, I believe there were about 3 or 4 and they took the time to come into each private section and even dance with the bride to be. 

This was such an incredible experience - I would highly recommend it for a party or group outing!"}
{"text":"We  came for a friend's bridal shower.
This might be a good place for a party like our as we could watch belly dancing and even participate.
The ambiance is nice and it's cozy, but too cozy for me, to the point where i felt a little claustrophobic.
Our party was big and I have to compliment the server who managed to serve fast and haven't confused any bills and orders.
I wasn't impressed with the food - it looked nicer than it tasted. Everything was too salty, which was really unnecessary as the dishes are very flavorful and have the character. The prices for the main dish are between $18 and $30.
Overall it was a good experience, but I probably won't come again."}
{"text":"we love this restaurant
the food is great
fun place for a couple or a group {a good date place in my opinion.) The seating has pillows and very comfortable. Areas can be sectioned of to form a tent. 
 We had a belly dancer , they danced for about 10-15 minutes for the group. They encourage people to join them in the dance.
We had a great evening"}
{"text":"Wet with group of friends yesterday, ordered the signature lamb shank which was highly recommended by the server, came and was soooo disappointing to aay the least, i could have made a better dinner. The lamb was soft but lacked any spices that would make it memorable. Same goes with the rice which lacked fragrance. The saving grace was probably the meat cigars which i loled but others in my party of 8 found insignificant. My friend's order of beef cherk was tasteless and so dry she ended up eating 10% only. The chickpeas ragu that came with it was also without flavour or spices. Such a disappointment. The highlight was supposed to be the belly dancing and unlike copa cabana, they only had one lady dancing for 30 minutes, not only was she old.. It wasn't appetizing to say the least.. Restaurant probably couldn't afford to pay for more than one dancer. On top of everything they charged a steep 18% SC for groups of 6+, for that kind of money ($60/pp including apps, main, one drink) i could go anywhere else and have an amazing dinner... Take your money elsewhere, they need to change the chef and management at this place to revive it."}
{"text":"I went to the Sultan's Tent for the Moroccolicious dinner on Saturday with some friends. I've actually been there several years ago and absolutely hated it. I think they changed their chef or something because the food was much better, almost authentic Moroccan. 

I had the duck salad which as okay, I'm not sure about the duck. I liked the mafftoul which my friend ordered. My entree was the chicken Marrakesh, the couscous really well cooked with spices and all. I loved it. For desert, creme brulee, you can't go wrong there. 

All that for $25, i think its a good deal. By the way, the setting is really beautiful but a little too dark. The servers were very friendly. I'm definitely going back to check out the BerBer lounge."}
{"text":"Found this place on the Internet and thought it would be pretty cool to eat while watching the belly dancers do their thing. Apart from the wonderful dancers and the interior design which was interesting, my experience there wasn't the best. I  wanted to eat out somewhere different for my birthday but I was better off going to the keg or moxies or something. The appetizers were trash and the second course meal was not the best either, my party and I actually stopped somewhere else after to eat some real tasteful food. I don't even want to get started on the waiters there who hardly came over to my table to check on us and she did and said everything with an attitude and not once did she smile. If they changed their food and staff the place would be a great place to dine"}
{"text":"Great place for a night out.
If your visiting Toronto This place is a must.
I give the food a 6.5/10 but the belly show a 10.
Well worth the money.
Its a great treat."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come here for dinner. I have heard such great things. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was great, the music was pleasant and they had a great cocktail menu. 

The reason this review is not getting 5 stars is because the waiter that served my table of 3 was very poor service. After coming by to ask for what drinks we would like it took him a half hour to come back to ask what we wanted for dinner. We had wine glasses that never got cleared throughout the whole dinner, we had to ask for water a few times before he remembered to bring out water. Dirty plates piled up without being cleared even though he had come by the table multiple times to bring out more food or drinks. He wasn't overly nice and not rude, he was just clearly not on the ball which made unpleasant."}
{"text":"What fun! Took my sister's bachelorette party here for dinner and the belly dancing was a total surprise for the bride! 

The environment was really beautiful and they were very diligent about getting everyone's order in before the dancing began, so you could just sit back and relax. We all ordered several options for the appetizers and were so happy with the multiple vegetarian selections that were provided. Yummy hummus, to boot! I wouldn't call the food earth-shattering, but it's filling and tasty. I had the lamb shank, and it was cooked very nicely, very tender. 

Around 9:30, the lights went low and the belly dancers put on an amazing show! It was astonishing to watch. They were wonderful at mixing and mingling too, so people in my party had fun learning some moves. 

Dinner and a show - a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. 
It seems most people just like coming here to say that they've been here. 
I can only assume it's the belly dancing show & Moroccan theme/decor that makes it oh -so-popular. Any one that has had Moroccan food before would know it's just A-OK. NOTHING more. in my personal opinion, the added hoopla does not equate to the food but more for the experience.  
Coming from a place where both are easily available. I wasn't too impressed. 

It was for a friends goodbye dinner. 
We had the four-course dinner. 

Order:
Harrira - some sort of lentil soup with kidneys & chic peas. - Deliciously savoury. It's got the perfect proportion of solid and broth. I really enjoyed this soup with a quick squeeze of a lemon slice. ^_^

Beef Burgogne - YUMM. Sirloin strips with celery, onion and a mash P on the side.Delicious!. The meat was SO tender. The sauce was a bit sweet but the onions and celery totally complemented it.  

Hummus - not bad. It comes in a long plate with 3 diff types of hummus (red pepper, classic chickpea and black bean. The portions are shockingly small. Unlike other restaurants, this isn't sharing friendly. The bread was soft and very fluffy. 

Crab cake - Very good. Again, lots of sweet action going on. Not sure how I feel about sweet and crab together. The plate was tiny. Again, not sharing friendly. The frog legs were SO DRY!. I've never tried them before so I'm not sure if that's just how frog leg's taste. dry and crispy??

Mango Salmon - This dish was gorgeous in presentation. The salmon was nicely but it couldve been cooked for a bit longer. I found it to be a bit colder than the rest of the meal. It came with rice and veggies. Which weren't too bad. Nothing exciting. 

Chkn Marakesh - I was so disappointed with this dish. Presentation was nice. The chicken was way too sweet. The onions on top made it even sweeter. This dish turned me off of couscous. It really didn't go well with the chicken and veggies. The veggies were turnips and sweet potatoes. I don't know if I would classify 4 chunks of root and potatoes as \"side veggies\". 

Dessert: 
Chocolate Oasis - way too rich. Helps that it comes in a small portion. Now THIS you can share with someone else if your just looking for that small bit of sugary finish
brulee - delicious but the body was a bit heavier and creamier than 
most brulee's. 

My favourite part is the mint jasmine tea. It's delicious. The old style kettle is SO gorgeous ^_^
 
The service was fantastic. We sat in the tent area for the show with the table for 2. Along the hall, there was 4 tables of 2. The rest was meant for larger groups. I'm not sure why anyone would suggest a table in the hallway. For 2 people, it's not very comfortable. I really really dock marks out for this. It really hurts the experience. 

The bathroom are closer to the front door and I really like how they make a point of telling you this as they walk you to your table. POINTS~. 

I wouldn't come back unless someone from out of town wants an exotic experience. Even then, I'd suggest for Korean BBQ over this, any day.

{"text":"This place is great! The food is delicious.  The service is excellent and it has great atmosphere and music.  It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to eat here. Had the fixed price menu.  Definitely not worth it. Bland. Slow service. Too expensive for what we had. The main was lamb shank. It was good.
Appetizer and dessert were boring. 
Won't come back.  Money better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was warm and accommodating. The pricing is incredibly deceptive and inconsistent. When you are seated the only menu available is the Prix fix and no pricing is provided. After inquiring, the cost is $55. When we asked for the a-la-cart menu, which we asked about before placing our reservation, and compared pricing, that's where things got interesting. If you were to add the most expensive items from all 3 courses it would still not equal to $55. The pricing on their Web site vs their a-la-cart menu vs their dessert menu have varying prices for the same item. 
The food was good, but not for this price point. I understand that you are paying a premium for the show, but the deceptive and misleading structure to their menus should be addressed."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious with my boyfriend and other friends. Points for beautiful decorations and overall atmosphere. The service was excellent and we had a great time just socializing with the staff and ourselves. Never felt rushed to leave even though it was quite busy that night. The Mint tea was my highlight of the night! But I have to take away 3 stars because later that evening 2 of us fell sick. I had the lamb from the winterlicious menu and my friend had the chicken from the menu as well. I threw up all night and ended up spending the rest of the night in an emergency room hooked to IVs to compensate...I had to take 4 days off of work to get over my throw up phase. I read a review on here earlier from a girl mentioning the same experience so I thought I'd add that you weren't the only one!! I hope these guys start serving fresher food or ill start praying I grow a thicker stomach line."}
{"text":"First let's talk about food. As far as taste, the food was fine, edible but nothing to write home about. 

We ordered the Chèvre Brûlée appetizer, which consisted of a thin sliver of goat cheese with port de cassis jam on a tiny, overly-toasted crostini. It was difficult to cut because of the hard cracker, and the cheese didn't appear baked in the least. However, the taste was nice, like cheesecake. It was shocking that such a ridiculously tiny portion would cost us an extra four dollars. Sadly, this was actually the best part of our meal.  

For our main dish, we ordered the Chickpea Tagine, a Moroccan stew. It was a simple dish of chickpeas in gravy accompanied by warm, buttered pita. This is something that I could whip up at home in a few minutes and although the menu announced a number of spices, the dish was bland. We added some amazing house-made Harissa hot sauce and that made the dish passable. 

For dessert, we ordered the Decadent Chocolate tart. It was chocolate-y, not too sweet and nothing special. The Creme Brûlée, however, was very good. 

Now let's talk about the show. Two belly dancers appeared for two songs. They did a few twirls and shimmies before dancing with the dinner guests. The dancers were sweet and it was fun to dance with them but this was not high quality entertainment worthy of its hefty price tag. 

The three-course prix fixe meal and belly dancing cost us 55$ per person. My boyfriend and I shared one three-course meal plus a 37$ bottle of wine plus an extra 4$ for the \"premium\" goat cheese. This evening cost us 130$ with tax and tip. 

We estimate that food and wine would have cost us 70$ at another restaurant of equivalent or better quality. That leaves us with 60$ for entertainment. For 30$ pp, we could definitely have seen a professionally choreographed show elsewhere with more than two dancers. 

Sultan's Tent is overpriced in relation to quality and entertainment. Never again."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious, for the $15 lunch menu, which was amazing considering the price. 

The appetizer was a beef spring roll, which was delicious, the beef burger was amazing it was topped with caramelized onions and raisons, and for dessert was brownies. The foo was really good considering I had a bad experience at the Sultan's Tent. 

The interiors were beautifully decorated, very Moroccan and authentic. The best part of the entire dining experience was our server. She was amazing, and very sweet. She served our food on time, gave us suggestions, and even provided us with complimentary speciality drink (sprite with passion fruit, and pomegranate juice). This is an amazing drink, and I would highly recommend going here for the customer service and drink. Shamy was excellent, and has a great personality. 

I am very happy and satisfied with Cafe Moroc, and I highly recommend going here and I will be back here again soon."}
{"text":"We were there for summerlicious on a Thursday night. The place was a little busy . The food was about 7 out of 10. The ambiance was great and comfortable. There was a belly dancer for entertainment and it was quite nice to watch. Now the service, was a bit slow. The starter came almost the minute we sat down. Everything else was very slow after that. Waiter's attention was so hard to get but even after we asked how much longer our fools will take, it still took another 20 min. Also staff had no personality. One of the football player looking server was just rude who looked like he didn't want to be there. He was tossing the plates on to our table with out saying anything . Service could improve a lot. Over all the place is not bad and could be better if the servers were happier."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 12 ladies for a bachelorette party, great atmosphere.  We were seated in our own tented area. Wait staff was extremely kind and helpful.  The dancers were great and fun, food was tasty and the portions were generous.  We had a 3 course prix fixed menu, I started with the royale bruschetta which was shrimp, chicken and lamb skewers with a tomato bruschetta. For my entrée I ordered the special of day which was a salmon with mango salsa with grilled vegetables and rice. I ordered the Baklava for dessert, probably was a few days old, was not at all flaky, very hard to chew but other than the dessert, we all had a good time.  If you're looking for a different dining experience, this is an option.  Recommended for dates and groups."}
{"text":"Favorite part was the beef and lamb spring rolls. The sauce on it was also really good. My flank steak was cooked very well and was tender. I can also recommend the french fries. They taste different and are very addictive once you get a taste."}
{"text":"A handful of people of recommended I try the Sultan's Tent and I finally had the opportunity last night.  

It was a pleasant to surprise to find out casual attire was acceptable in Café Maroc, the front part of the restaurant, though I noticed quite a few people were very dressed up for the tent part of the restaurant, likely for a special occasion.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the Moroccolicious menu, which is just like a Summerlicious menu - 3-course dinner for $25.  I believe it's on until the beginning of September.

It was extremely dark inside, so we were lucky to get a window seat right at the front of the café section.  The hostess explained to us that you have the option of ordering à la carte or ordering off the Moroccolicious menu when you dine at Café Maroc.  If you wish to dine in the Sultan's Tent, you have a 4 course meal starting at $39.95 and will be entertained with belly dancing.  We chose the Café.

I ordered the duck breast and mango salad for my appetizer, which was alright, but I highly recommend the Maftoul - a Moroccan crispy eggroll.

For the main course, I highly recommend the beef ribs.  I don't think I've ever tasted a meat more tender or more flavourful.  The vegetables that accompanied the ribs were pretty good, but the meat was definitely the highlight.  I also had a taste of their chicken and couscous dish.  The highlight of that dish was the topping of onions and some sort of sauce.  Again, lots of flavour.

Dessert was a crème brûlée for me.  It was definitely one of the better crème brûlée's I have had - the top was done nicely, but I found it a little on the heavy side and couldn't finish it all.  The Moroccan treats (the other option for dessert) wasn't overly exciting.

The service was great.  The food arrived impressively quickly and our waiter made sure to check on us at least once per course, but wasn't bothering us too often.

I'm looking forward to dining in the Tent to experience the belly dancing."}
{"text":"A difficult venue to place judgment, for a person whose relevancy to Moroccan culture is as sharp as Sarah Palin's interview responses. 
I had an enjoyable time, and that is largely contributed to the great company I brought with me. And although my experiences was overall a positive one, suspicion is unshakable regarding whether or not if it was actually authentic. 

The location was convenient enough, yet somehow I still managed to pass it twice before finally finding the front door. 
I got inside, and waited patiently for the Maitre'D, until I realized that the restaurant was actually deeper inside the premises. Apparently I was only at the Cafe, once I was seated inside the 'Sultan's Tent,' did I begin to take the atmosphere in. It was like a tent alright, the magical ones that I've only seen in the Harry Potter movies, where you walk into this small inconspicuous outer shell, and arrive at a desert oasis (with pub-like lighting).
This place is only suitable for large groups, or couples. The seating is wall mounted booth chairs for groups of 6+, or the alternative..a(small) table for two on the other side, leaving room in-between for the dancers to come out. It almost felt like a nightclub, with the exception of an environment that is less hostile. 
The wait for the food was painful, I think it took around forty-five minutes from ordering, to the arrival of the entrée. So I ended up ordering lots of wine. I called ahead because on their website there was no wine menu, but the lady assured me that because their wine selection was so extensive, they couldn't put it all on their website. Talk about a poor excuse. How extensive could it be? I couldn't imagine it being bigger than 360's, or Barbarians. Not a chance.
There was altogether six of us, and we all loved food, so I think we just about ordered everything on the menu. I didn't hear any complaints, and I had very little myself. The food was excellent, even if I didn't know half of the things I ate. The 'Maftoul\" and braised lamb stood out...the Seafood Royale however, did not. 
The belly dancers was an enjoyable post-dinner experience. They will grab you and encourage you to dance with them, as they will garnish you with their jewelry. Best to keep your shy friends at home.
There are two shows on weeknights, and three on Weekends. Which means your clock starts ticking from the time that you arrive. They were tedious with bringing the food out, but they wrap up like a roadshow carny, and I felt at the end I was pretty much rushed out of the restaurant. I guess that's dinner-theatre.

Interesting themed venue, good food, good show, and I learned absolutely nothing about the Moroccan Culture."}
{"text":"\"Wow,Sultan's tent is great place to dine, worth every penny!\" says my friend. Sadly my friend is big fat liar, but she was right about me spending all my pennies. Sultan's tent from the outside and even the decor itself is truly stunning. A great middle eastern feel and ambiance, inferring an intimate and romantic feel. But these are the only merits, the only star in my rating. The food is atrocious and bland. No really cheifery or passion. I have eaten at other places with the same genre and loved it, so you can rule out the bias. Menu is expensive (must get a three course meal) with real variety. Yes there is live entertainment, but nothing really to tell your grandpa about. Seating and tents block your view most of the time and you cant event talk to your friends because the seats are so awkward and hard to move. So please do yourself a favor, spend your money else where!"}
{"text":"Cafe Moroc. My first dining experience involving Moroccan food and I have to say I'm still not really sure what cuisine I just had. Tried the summerlicious lunch menu of Maftoul, Moroccan Burger, and creme brulee, and while I didn't find the food particularly outstanding, for $15, it's more than worth it.

The bad:
-confusing as soon as you get there, I'm at sultans tent, and yet i'm at cafe moroc. Could not find a cafe moroc sign anywhere so I had to ask once inside.
-moroc burger, moroc fries. It's really just a burger and fries and compared to a regular burger, it wasn't even that great. The fries with the chipotle dipping sauce however, I enjoyed.

the good:
-the appetizer (maftoul), was probably the most \"Moroccan\" thing I had. It was good, interesting, but a little bit oily. Its like a smaller spring roll therefore more oil per bite.
-the creme brulee was pretty good and an pleasant ending to the meal.

Overall, for the price i paid, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience. 
Service was good, prices awesome, food, not bad. The summerlicious menu is at least 4 stars but If I were to pay regular prices as posted on their website, definitely a 2 at the most. So to even things out, I give Cafe Moroc a 3."}
{"text":"Unlike two of the below reviews this place will not lose stars just because I did not feel like getting my belly dancing 'freak on'! 

Having been years since I last tried Morocon food I was not sure what to expect but thanks to Viviana M for organising a UYE there.

The menu was the summerlicious one which was a reasonable price with a decent range of dishes.

For starters which was (stealing names from Joie T as I never remember)

- Maftoul - very tasty although pastry was tougher than your average spring roll but the filling and sauce was uber nice

For mains I had a big serving of beef on the bone which was delicious, just about finished this dish. The meat was so tender and tasty that the wine gravy spoiled it for me at times.

For desert, had the creme brulee  which again was nice, not usually a fan of deserts but this one I was tempted to lick the pot it came in.

The service here was good, and the staff friendly. We did not have to wait too long for our food and all the dishes came at once.

Decorations and ambience were also good, with seating at the rear of the restaurant for the belly dance show. Maybe next time if the ladies really want to see me belly dance they should just ply me with alcohol!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with all the reviews I've seen so far  - this restaurant is overpriced, has very mediocre food quality, spotty service, and unremarkable entertainment.

~~Value of the Food~~
I'd heard good things about Sultan's Tent so wanted to give it a try, and when I saw the TravelZoo \"$49 for $100 of food+drink\"  I jumped on the deal. (2x40$ dinners and 2x$10 liqueur aperitifs)
However, the quality of the food decreased with each course that arrived. 
1st course: My girlfriend and I both tried the Harira chickpea soup, which was delicious. We loved it. 
2nd course: The pita trio with hummus was decent, but the \"pastry cigars\" filled with beef and spice were like a bland beef spring roll. 
3rd course: The lamb feast was ok, nothing special. Slightly dry meat, decent lamb flavor. Veggies were unimpressive - like other reviewers pointed out, \"root veggies\" means carrots and potatoes. My girlfriend had the chicken Marrakesh which had a delicious-sounding description but the actual dish was fairly bland and the chicken overcooked. 
4th course: a laughable \"morrocan dessert\" plate with 2 cookies that tasted like they came from the tins at the pharmacy, and two slices of orange with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. I fully agree with other reviews I saw that found this a bit shocking - even at Japanese restaurants they at least give you a full orange. And it's not dry.


~~Spotty service~~
Our waiter was attentive and timely during the first 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes of our 2+hour meal, but for the hour in the middle he didn't even come over or look at our table. It wasn't busy.. we visited on a Tuesday night at 8:30PM. There were maybe 8 tables with other people. We went 45 minutes between 2nd and 3rd courses without anyone even collecting our empty plates. Aside from this, he did a decent job and was polite and explained everything well. 

I have to say, though, charging a mandatory 15% gratuity was unacceptable in my opinion when neither the menu nor the TravelZoo voucher I had said anything about the amount of gratuity required. We were a table for 2, and while I would've been happy to tip 15% on the full amount before the discount, I didn't appreciate being **forced** to give 15%.


~~Entertainment~~
The 1 bellydancer that came out worked the room for about half an hour. During the later half of her performance, she would stop at tables to get the ladies to join her. She would teach them a few moves and let them dance with her for a few minutes. She was friendly, encouraging, and gave everyone a fun time. Sure, I've seen much better belly-dancing but it was fun nonetheless. Nothing special.


~~Ambiance~~
Beautiful interior décor . The washrooms were fancy and clean. Our table had comfy cushions on the benches. During the half hour of belly-dancing the room got very very dark though.. too dark to even see your food, I couldn't tell the meat from the sauce. Considering how loud the music was during the belly-dancing performances, it became awkwardly quiet for the entire night afterwards. 


-----------------

I am not surprised that Sultan's Tent has explored Groupon-style vouchers, because I certainly wouldn't recommend this restaurant at full price. I hope that they improve their quality of food and value for money (we didn't even get any of the insanely overpriced upgrades) because with such a prime location and niche concept it seems like a waste at the moment. Unless I hear that something has been changed for the better, I definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 picked Cafe Maroc for a Summerlicious dinner: $25 for cozy/sophisticated atmosphere, NICE portion sizes (i like paying money to be full), and lovely intro to Moroccan cuisine. good deal!

the MAFTOUL was akin to spring rolls, with an excellent crispy (not at all greasy) shell and lightly curried beef filling. well balanced with the chipotle aioli.

my entree pick of MOROCCAN BEEF SHORT RIBS was by far the best! incredibly tender meat (my heart skipped a beat when i first dug my knife in) deeply infused with flavour. borderlined a bit too salty, but paired well with the accompanying potato/parsnip mash.

i only tried a bite of the MANGO SALMON, but it was easily forgettable for me -- could've used more mango salsa.

the BRULÉE ROYALE was quite rich but not cloyingly sweet and my loves: apple pie + cheesecake joined forces in the SPICED CINNAMON, CARAMEL, APPLE CHEESECAKE. not too sweet, not too heavy, awesome apple flavour, and it was made with what seemed like an oreo cookie crust, which was bizarre but it worked :)"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are ONLY because of my waitress, decor, ambiance and cleanliness. 
I came here for a special night out with my girlfriend. Upon walking in you see a huge bar to your left with an enormous selection of drinks. You don't get the real vibe of the place until you walk past the bar. 

We got seated at our own table inside of circular room styled tent with other parties having their own tables as well. The lighting was dim and really let the romantic mood set it. It also gave the restaurant a mysterious feel for looking around in discovery to really enjoy the rich decor. Our waitress came to us quickly and took our order. She'd informed us of a special they had where for a set price of $50 we'd get 2 appetizers, 2 dinner entrees and 2 desserts and we went with that. Surprisingly enough everything we ordered came out without a lot of waiting time. 

Here's the bad news. The food was extremely bland. It was lacking heavily in the flavor department. My girlfriend and I decided to trade what we'd ordered in hopes that it may help... It didn't. Her food was just as bland as mine.  The best thing we had were our alcoholic beverages. It was some sort of sparkling wine mixed with passion fruit and pomegranate seeds. 

What really saved the night was the belly dancer. She was great! Very energetic, went to every table, even inside the tents and had other customers join in on the dancing. While the moves were limited she definitely was very interactive and entertaining performer. 

If I decide to try Moroccan food again I'll be going to a hole in the wall place instead."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Moroc twice during Winterlicious and Summerlicious and enjoyed my experience both times. Once was for lunch and once for dinner. The main course selection was a little different but the portions were still more than enough. 

I ordered the maftoul's both times and I still love them. Their secret sauce on top of what seemed like spring rolls were great. The menu said they were Moroccan cigars.

During lunch I had the 6-ounce Moroc steak baguette with a side of Moroc frites. Tasted great and it was a very good sized portion. I couldn't finish my plate.

During dinner I ordered the braised lamb shank with a side of couscous. It was my first time trying couscous so I wasn't sure what to expect. I wasn't a fan. Maybe at another location? My girlfriend ordered the Moroccan beef short ribs which were just as good as my lamb. I guess I couldn't choose between the two dishes. It was accompanied by yukon gold-parsnip mashed and veggies. Dope!

For dessert we had some Moroccan treats that were easily forgettable. Service was top notch during lunch because we had an extra special waitress that was always prompt with refilling our water"}
{"text":"I couldn't decide whether to give three or four stars. The food was great! I had a crab cake, the couscous salad, the chickpea stew and baklava for desert. The crab cake and couscous salad were delicious! The chickpea stew and baklava were nothing special but still very good. 

I took away two stars because our server was quite awkward and uncomfortable serving us. In addition, after we had finished our meal we just wanted to relax and finish catching up but we were basically kicked out of our table. The waiter brought the bill and debit machine almost immediately after we finished our desert without even asking. Considering we were spending quite a bit of money we did not expect to have a time limit on our stay but apparently a large party was coming into our section. We would have appreciated this to be communicated to us beforehand so we could have the option of choosing a different table. Another table was not offered to us, we were just expected to pay and leave without any warning. We found this extremely rude and when we asked to speak to the manager all he did was offer us a complimentary drink on our next visit,  very helpful when you live in another province"}
{"text":"Not a complaint about this place. Admittedly, I have used a travelzoo voucher each and every time I've ever been here - much to the vocal chagrin of a female server who was serving the table beside us, but not my party of 4.
 The voucher includes gratuity on the entire value of the meal and anything added, like drinks. 

The four courses are amazing. I've now tried a variety of dishes here, in each of the four courses, including some of the upcharged items, and nothing disappoints.  The meat like the lamb and beef ribs are fall off the bone tender. Portions are very generous. You will roll out of here. With a huge smile on your face!

Might I add, the entertainment is cute and fun. The interior plush and cozy.

Do yourself a favour and ask for a side of the Harissa hot sauce!!! yummmm My mouth is watering now..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. 

It feels like you've entered Morocco. As you walk into the restaurant, you're greeted by a staff member and they'll take you into the restaurant. There is soft music playing, dim lighting and Moroccan tents on the sides for the larger groups. Since we were just two people, we were seated on the sides of the large walkway beside the large tents. 

Being my first time trying Moroccan food, I was already in love with the atmosphere. We ordered the Royal Brochette for our appetizer, which includes lamb, chicken, shrimp skewers, Moroccan salsa, and fresh lemon. As for entrees, we ordered the Braised Lamb Shank and the Hargma Beef Cheek. The Braised Lamb Shank consisted of slow cooked lamb, cashews, green zucchini, tomatoes, and saffron rice. The Hargma Beef Cheek consisted of beef cheeks, chickpea ragu, carmelized onions, raisins, and almonds. Everything was very flavourful and the meat was cooked until they were tender.

They make their own hot sauce in house. We asked for hot sauce and they told us it will take a while because they make it on the spot. The hot sauce was very spicy, it is not your typical hot sauce as it was more of a hot pepper flavour in a paste form.

Another thing to note is that there is also a belly dancing performance near 8-9 PM for about 30 minutes. The bellydancer would dance around each table and see if guests would like to dance with her. Many people did and it was a fun time to see. It was very cool to experience as you get another feel into the culture. 

I recommend this restaurant for large parties or dates with your special someone. There were 4-5 birthday celebrations when I went and also a bachelorette party when I was there. This is a great place with a great atmosphere and delicious food. Especially if it's something that is a first experience for both!"}
{"text":"Although i am not middle eastern I know their food.  This restaurant is more of show then food. 
I can tell the kitchen staff is not middle eastern as the dishes lacks the herbs and flavours of that region. 
The belly dancer was stiff ... i could dance better.
Not going there again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. A fun place to have dinner.  We got the hummus, chick pea salad and couscous salad for appetizers.  Those were very good.  The entrees were so so. I got the vegetables and couscous.  Basically that's all it was with some tomato sauce on top. My husband got the lamb shank. Just one so less than what he was thinking.  It was ok. The dessert was good. I got the chocolate tart. Very rich I couldn't finish it. My husband got the baklava huse said it was good. We both had the dark Morrocan beer which was very good but 8.50 a beer seemed high.  Our server was nice and attentive . The entertainment was fun.  The girls came over and got us to do some dancing.  My only problem was that unless they were right in your section you couldn't see much at all. And it was shorter than I thought it would be. Our price tag at the end of the night was 200 including tip. Steep but it was my birthday so we said oh well. We won't return but if you are looking for something different this fits the bill."}
{"text":"We had a work function here with about 30 people last week. I had the four course meal which was about $40. Here's what I enjoyed:

1st course: Harira Soup - nice flavour with a modest spicy kick and a variety of beans

2nd course: Maftoul - a bit like a spring roll but with beef and Moroccan spices

3rd / Main : Moroccan beef short rib - so tender, meat falls off the bone

4th: Moroccan Treats - Some mixed desserts, wasn't a big fan

The place look's great. The seating has pillows and very comfortable. Areas can be sectioned of to form a tent. The service was good, they handled the large group despite the restaurant being packed. I will come back with my wife, a good date place in my opinion. We had a belly dancer which was cool, they danced for about 10-15 minutes for the group. They encourage people to join them in the dance.

A good overall experience - highly recommended. You can also pop over to C'est What for a chocolate desert beer after dinner."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got to go to this place! Lovely atmosphere (love the Berber tents) and great service! Belly dancing was fun but more of a touristy gimmick rather than a cultural experience. Food was delicious and they didn't charge to cut a massive cake for my moms birthday. My only concern was the seats. The couch type seating by the tables in the tent are fine but the short and low circular chairs were so uncomfortable! I'll be back though ."}
{"text":"it's such a pretty place and the dining experience is pretty unique i guess. But you cant help but feel like you're eating resort food. 
The tea is delicious though!"}
{"text":"The Sultan's Tent was the perfect place to host a friend's birthday. When we entered, we were immediately impressed by the dark ambiance and lavish decor of drapery and pillows.  My group was seated in a cozy corner offside the main floor where we had a great view of the belly dancers when the entertainment began. They even grabbed hold of our birthday girl, and we were able to take pictures of the action. 

The curtains separating table areas allow for privacy, and as you pull them back, it opens the space up to a more social and connected environment. The service was wonderful, very knowledgeable and attentive to our table, and the food was amazing!! I had the lamb with garlic potatoes and roasted veg, and it was cooked exactly the way I ordered. We also had the chevre crostini with red onions, a few salads, house cocktails and a seafood saffron dish that was great. So was the chocolate dessert and the delicious mint tea served at the end of the night!

The Sultan's Tent is great for celebrations, and we loved their sister location next door, Berber. I hope to be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful interior at this resto/ cafe. It's  a real experience every time. The music and dancers make it a very unique experience. I love the coffee offered and food pairings it's all very special. Service is top notch and the experience is always wonderful. Pricing is a little pricey however it depends on what you order like anywhere. It's bang downtown so it's definitely worth a visit. Great venue for a bday or special event or date. It's a very intimate and romantic setting you forget your aLong front street  one of the busiest roads."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place, its very authentic and the food is great. I waited 1 h for someone to take my order..... i got my food by 11:30 pm (reservations was 8:45 pm) the danse show is cute but its only 10 min ... way to short. I really had a good night but it was way to long .... i kind of needed a another drink ( on the house because it was way to long) but nobody came back ...... But i had a good night!"}
{"text":"I was invited to The Sultan's Tent for a triple date last week. I had never heard of the place (and neither had Yelp Toronto) so I consulted my other standby for online civilian restaurant reviews, the Chowhound forum.

As I read the reviews, I grew concerned. The predominating opinion was \"avoid at all costs\". I understood that I would be dining at an overpriced touristy gimmick of a restaurant with bad service and even worse food. Nobody had anything good to say about this place, but since I was an invitee and not the organizer of the gathering, there was nothing I could do.

I arrived expecting the worst. Straight off, I saw that the faux Moroccan decor of the Sultan's Tent is something special - the seating is on plush couches heaped with cushions, lengths of silk are draped overhead like tents. It is definitely gimmicky but I dug the romantic atmosphere. The tables in the tent areas were a little awkward to eat from, however.  
 
The Sultan's Tent proper has a prix fixe menu: $40 for four courses (the Cafe Maroc at the front of the restaurant is a la carte). There are supplementary costs for some of the pricier selections, so you could end up spending $20 on top of the fixed menu. I had base price items for everything but dessert.

The first course is your choice of light starters like soup, salad or a dish of olives. I had the haria, a rustic tomato and chickpea soup which had been much maligned by the Chowhounders. It was delicious and spicy. 

Next round, more appetizer-y selections like crab cakes, pastries, and such. My maftoul, Moroccan beef spring rolls,  were beautifully presented. I loved them - awesome texture!

The entrée course is where the extra charges can get dangerous. Add $10 to your bill for the rack of lamb or seafood royale or $15 for the fillet mignon. I chose the Moroccan beef ribs: I was served two huge, tasty ribs cooked to perfect tenderness. The accompanying veggies were also excellent.

Once the main courses arrived, the lights dimmed and a bellydancer came out to gyrate and slink around the room. She danced well but her vacant eyes betrayed her disinterest in the spectacle. She did try to involve various diners in her shimmying and bouncing (birthday celebrants, bachelorettes and enthusiastic others). My problem with the dance segment of the evening was that the lighting was so low, I couldn't see to eat the luscious rib dinner in front of me!

I should mention that there was no sign of the poor service or the long waits between courses that the Chowhounds condemned. Our server was attentive and polite and the courses were well paced, the only area for improvement being that the next courses were delivered before the dishes were cleared from the previous one.

The basic price dessert was a dish of three Moroccan cookies, which were nothing interesting. I had chosen the pistachio creme brulee for $3 extra and I was happy I did.

After my meal, I was very confused as to why the Sultan's Tent has such a terrible reputation among Toronto foodies. Is my taste really so declasse? I mentioned this puzzle to a friend the next day and she had the answer: the Sultan's Tent is under brand new management. They must have made significant improvements because I enjoyed my meal very much and I recommend it for a special, fun outing.

(Gratitude goes to the founder of my feast, Rich S. Thank you!)"}
{"text":"The bathrooms are clean and the belly dancers are nice, but the only thing that would entice me to visit this location again is to buy the mint tea, but I can probably but that elsewhere for a much lower price...

I wanted to love this restaurant, but sadly I will not return."}
{"text":"I came here recently for dinner with a few girlfriends.  As others have mentioned, the decor is really beautiful.  The unique setup (each tent can accommodate one large party or two smaller parties of about 6-8 each) makes for an intimate, interesting experience. 

The menu is a bit confusing- the prix fixe and a la carte menus are identical, but I guess they assume that most people order the prix fixe because they don't put the individual item prices on the menu.  Some of us wanted the a la carte option so that took a little bit of back and forth with the server to sort out.

Food: I ordered the chicken fez tagine and wasn't terribly impressed with it.  My friends were all thrilled with their choices (lamb shank, mafoul) so maybe I just picked a bad one?  The meat was crazy moist and tender, but I nearly ended up busting a tooth on a piece of bone, and the flavour was a bit bland to me. 

The hummus is perfectly garlicky and delicious and the Moroccan mint tea was also fantastic. 

The belly dancing show was so cool!  I get the sense that the menu prices are a little expensive to cover the cost of the show, but I think it's a fair trade; I was there on a weeknight and the dancers performed for about half an hour.

Bottom line: this is not somewhere I'd go on the regular, but it's good for a large group, and the show and atmosphere are definitely unique!"}
{"text":"The rice comes out of bus bins, the potatoes are microwaved, the lamb rack is pre grilled then warmed up.  It's absolutely disgusting
This place is a ducking hole it always has been. New owners can't even renovate?? change the carpet maybe clean the drapes?? Stop spending time on making newsletters and clean the place up. Put the ear pieces down you aren't that busy. And CLEAN the place. Lou and Angela didn't clean the place once in the 150 years they owned it. So CLEAN IT its disgusting. There cockroaches and mice. Just clean the place change the carpet. God damn it"}
{"text":"I think I was forced to order a 4 course meal at the Sultan's Tent. Serves me right. I arrived late. But I don't think any of us had an option. So a 4 course meal for all of us it is! 

Highlights were my 2nd and 4th course. I've dined here twice before and not once have I had a memorable dish until the other night. The Moroccan cigars (Moroccan styled spring rolls) and creme brulee topped with crushed pistachios were ooooooh so delish! 

My duck salad and salmon were okay, but nothing to rave about. 

I went here for a birthday cele with 7 other girls. The live belly dancing entertainment is a unique addition to dinner, but it doesn't create me as regular diner. 

The service was excellent, but we came here on a Tuesday night and it was dead. It's possible the service was attentive since the staff didn't really have anyone else to look after. 

Another plus of this restaurant lacking customers was the free belly dancing lessons for most of us. 

It was a fun night, but the overall experience doesn't justify all the money I spent. Doubt I'll be back anytime soon. I'll have to make some major cut backs on my day-to-day lifestyle before dining here again."}
{"text":"I visited the Cafe Moroc \"section\" of the Sultan's Tent for dinner the other night and I had a great time overall.  To my understanding, Cafe Moroc has more affordable prices than The Tent.  I went with a group of 8, so the cafe's small interior was a bit cramped, but not uncomfortably so.  All of their round tables are suitable for parties of 2-3, so we had to sit in a group of 4 small round tables; kind of inconvenient/awkward.

I ate the braised lamb feast, which was dee-licious.  The lamb shank was so incredibly tender it literally fell off the bone.  While it wasn't a \"feast\" per-se (it was only one large-ish sized piece of lamb) it was moderately priced at only $17.  Overall, I would go there again."}
{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious lunch for a group of almost 20 ppl. Food was ok for the price but I probably won't go there unless organizing for a event like this again. No belly dancing during Summerlicious, and there was even no A/C on the hottest day of this summer!"}
{"text":"Diners who are vegan BEWARE! We ordered the pre-fixe menu which is special for new years eve. The truffled wild mushroom soup was delicious as it was pureed. This was my first time eating puree mushroom soup. I really enjoyed it. The Kashah Conscous salad was cold and plain. A dessert that was vegan was the vegan chocolate which I found tasty. The zaalouk salad eggplant and tomato served with pita bread I enjoyed although I did bite into solid lemon pieces. The service was speedy and efficient. The belly dancers were captivating and the music that accompanied the dancers was ear-filling."}
{"text":"Party of 8, most of us tried different things. Lamb shank seems to be the overwhelming fav. Cote de beauf wasn't like previous pics and was a thins down.
Dance was meh.
Lamb shank, service and wine got this place the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a special occassion, or if you want to do something touristy.  Reservations are a must.  Participation in the bellydance  show a necessity.
enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really don't know where to begin. .
Came here with a party of 4 and the service was not what I expected.  Waiting for 10 mins for  someone to take our order for drinks and since the dinner was a pre fixed price and menu you would think that it wouldn't take 45 minutes to get dinner  so from the time we got there to when we actually hot our mediocre food was over an hour. We were cramped in a seating area that wasn't very clean. The belly dancing was not that great. The ladies could have practice more.
I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cafe Moroc: Ventured for lunch last week with a friend during the week. 
Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, we sat at the front near the window, very welcoming and nice music in the background. Service was impeccable... menu had a great selection for lunch, plus they have a prix fix for $15 (saw quite a few patrons choosing this option) . I decided to try a couple of things. The presentation of the food was great, it was fresh, my beef baguette was good ... but I think I was expecting something Moroccan (?) I could have made this at home. The fries are fantastic and spiced up... the \"Moroccan cigars\" maftoul were fine, but again maybe I expected more raisin or nuts and more spice. I did not like the crab cakes at all and found them too salty. Honestly, the food was not bad it just was nothing special.  I may give it another try."}
{"text":"Looooove this place!! Really? I wish I could move in. The decor is spectacular!

The food is awesome yummyness! 

I had wished that I was with more than 1 person so that we could have had our own little tented booth."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday for Winterlicious with my boyfriend. We missed the 6:30 belly dancing show and still sat for the prefix dinner which was $50 a person. Might I just say that the website does not show the Winterlicious menu. So once we sat down we were told to be out by 9pm by a very unenthusiastic waiter who did not give a care in the world about service. For the pre-fix menu was very limited and NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I ordered 2 tiny samosas, a bowl of couscous with 10 tiny pieces of lamb and 1 triangle piece of baklava. REALLY?! This is all I get for $50 and missing the show?! 

This is a total sham and not worth the money. I will not be returning ever. I had such high hopes for the food too."}
{"text":"If I could give a 3.5, I would, but seeing as Yelp likes whole numbers, I'm increasing it a bit to 4 stars on the part of them providing superb service. 

I came here for a birthday Summerlicious lunch with my bf.  Neither of us had ever tried Moroccan cuisine, so we were pretty stoked.  The interior design instantly hits you when you arrive.  The Moroccan decor is nice on the eyes, with its many arched door ways, ceramic knick knacks, and patterned fabrics.  From the front door to the back and even to the washrooms, the owners went all out on creating a Moroccan atmosphere.  If you're a fan of selfies and instagrammable backgrounds, then you'll be happy coming here.

For our appetizers, we ordered:

- Hummus and Pita: You guessed it.  It's the hummus and pita that you're probably already familiar with, though they serve the pita in its toasted variety.  The olives that they top the hummus with really adds a punch to the dish, even for an olive-hater like myself.  The servers refill your pita chips if you have leftover hummus, so don't worry about portioning your hummus out.  I liked this dish, though I didn't feel that it was anything special because of the long-standing hummus and pita craze that had already made it well-known and common.

- Signature Maftoul:  Think of eating a fried spring roll with seasoned beef inside instead of shrimp.  Topped with chipotle aioli and stuffed with hints of raisin and Moroccan cigar, this was my favourite dish of the night.   I would eat a whole plateful, if that was available. 

For our entrees, we ordered:

- Roasted Leek and Goat's Cheese Quiche with Moroc Frites:  I didn't particularly find this dish to be flavourful.  The quiche was soft, but it as almost tasteless, albeit having a subtle hint of cheese.  As for the frites, they were regular fries seasoned with a mixture of spices.  I would say that if you're a fan of Cajun fries, you'll like this side. 

- Royal Meat Skewers with Couscous: This entree was not bad. The shrimp skewer was excellent, noted my bf.  The lamb meat was mixed with spices and herbs before being shaped into a sausage and skewered.  I am not a big fan of lamb, but I found that the spices and herbs really complemented the meat, so that really says something.

For our desserts, we ordered:

- Baklava:  The server guessed that it was my birthday and had placed a candle on my baklava!  That was very cool of him!  The baklava was delicious with its light flavour and crispy texture.  This is my runner up dish of the night, second to the Maftoul.

- Nutella and Banana Crepe:  The banana that was used in this crepe had sour notes to it, so my bf did not really enjoy this, even though he is an avid fan of nutella.  If they had used riper bananas, then maybe this could have been a pleasant ending to our meal.

Overall, the food was decent.   I wasn't blown away by the presentation, flavour, or portion size.  From what I observed at the neighbouring tables, many patrons also left their plates half untouched, so I don't think many found their food to be very impressionable.  The server gets a big thumbs up for keeping us entertained, often cracking jokes with the diners and going above and beyond with his service (eg. adding a candle to my baklava).  However, service and nice decor alone don't cut it, so I will still most likely pass on this as a lunch spot in the future.  Nonetheless, I will definitely try the dinner one day, as there's a traditional Moroccan dance performance packaged with the meal."}
{"text":"Went to the Sultan's Tent to conclude my slew of Winterlicious adventures with the ladies at my office. 

As you walk in to the restaurant, the front end is a café which is nicely lit from the natural light that shines through the window with a nice view of the street.  But as you venture farther inside, the lighting gets dimmer, and you drift further and further away from the world and end up inside the Sultan's Tent.  Dimly lit, and draped with chiffon curtains, the Sultan's Tent gives you a semi-private dining feel as each \"tent\" seats about 2 parties of 6. 

The server was very accomodating and attentive to food allergies.  Since we had all had the time to peruse the menu beforehand, we ordered promptly.

Of the appetizers, we experienced:
Maftoul (aka Moroccan \"cigars\")
Harira (Tomato-based chickpea soup)
Café Greens

I had the Maftoul (aka Moroccan \"cigars\"), and it was quite yummy.  The ground beef was surprisingly tender, and the cumin added a nice spice to the cigars. The phyllo was nice and crispy without being overly oily. The chipotle aioli was excellent! 

For mains, we ordered:
Mango Salmon (w/ side of moroccan veggies and saffron basmati rice)
Maroc Barbeque Chicken Wrap (w/ side of fries)
Maroc Steak Baguette (w/ side of fries or café greens)

I had the Mango Salmon.  It was served on a bed of saffron basmati rice.  For starters, the rice was cold.  The vegetables were only slightly warm but very hearty.  The salmon was surprisingly tender, not overcooked nor undercooked.  The crunchiness of the mango and cucumber from the mango salsa added an element of freshness to the dish.  I can't comment on the Maroc Steak Baguette or the Moroccan Barbeque Chicken Wrap as I did not get to taste them.  However, it should be noted that the server did not ask us how we liked our steak done, and one of the ladies mentioned that it was probably because the steak was so thin.  She had also indicated that the steak was a little bit overcooked.

As for dessert, we indulged in:
Berry & Caramel Apple Crisp
Brûlée Royale
Maroc Treats

I decided to try the Berry & Caramel Apple Crisp... Wait, it was a Berry and Apple Crisp?  I almost forgot that was what it was because there were definitely no berries in mine.  The dish disappointed me because it was not hot.  No I'm not asking for right out of the oven hot, it was cold.  Who serves a cold apple crisp?  A few of the apples were burnt, and the cream had been overwhipped and had lost its volume.  It was the saddest whipped cream I had ever seen.  

I would give the Sultan's Tent a 2.5 star rating for its food, 3.5 stars for its service, and a 4 stars for the ambiance.  The neglect of attention to detail was what ruined my experience at the Sultan's Tent.  Cold food is one big turn off, especially when it is f-f-f-reezing outside!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like The Sultan's Tent, but I was extremely disappointed.

After going to Morocco and loving the culinary experience there, I know I can't expect the same thing but come on!!  I went for a romantic dinner for two there hoping to escape the Toronto city-life and whisked away into exotic paradise.  The prices were expensive, the food was plain, the belly dancers were cool but the performance was kind of awkward.  We accidentally walked into Berber Lounge downstairs and we should have stayed there, at least  the decor felt like Morocco.

The experience you should expect there:

- Disorganized staff (couldn't organize a waiting area, let alone seat us).
- Pricey dining
- Bland, unoriginal food
- belly dancers - kind of cool, but they had about 3 spread out awkwardly throughout the restaurant

I see some other recommendations, and I may try again, but highly unlikely."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with a group of 14 people. We were seated at the front of the restaurant near the door so we were unable to see or participate in the belly dancing so I cannot comment on that.  I ordered a appetizer Maftoul, main Short rib and dessert, rice pudding.  The appetizer Maftoul, arrived barely warm.  The outer pastry was hard and the filling had no particular taste.  Up next was the short rib.  It was a decent sized rib and the meat was very tender, again no real flavor to it and it was very fatty.  Dessert was the highlight of the meal for me.  The rice pudding was excellent--not sure if it was homemade or tinned but it was toothsome.  Thanks to other reviewers I knew well in advance not to order the \"Moroccan Treats\" which are basically just 2 or 3 store bought variety cookies.  My fellow diners that ordered the \"Moroccan Treats\" were very disappointed.   Service was OUTSTANDING--our server was Danielle and she was very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Very festive atmosphere!! The server John was quick to bring us our meals. We had a 4 course meal of the duck salad, to the boeuf bourgogne, to the calamari. There is not one bad thing I can think of about this place. Their tents and whole Moroccan theme is pretty sweet. They had about 1 1/2 of belly dancing which was quite entertaining. I can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"My friends treated me to dinner at the Sultan's Tent and it was a novel experience for me. 

The multicoloured tent itself is beautiful and there are unique chandeliers which hang from the top. The ambience was pleasing to the eye. The 4 course dinner was $40 and it was average. I had the cafe greens and they tasted like a generic salad. What stood out for me was the delicious maftoul, which was crispy pastry stuffed with beef and spices and drizzled with an amazing chipotle aioli. For my third course, I had the chicken Marakesh, and it was subpar, as was my creme brulee. That said, I enjoyed the entertaining and flexible belly dancers and one of my friends and I even got in on the action through participating in a dance. I have a new found appreciation for the art of belly dancing.

Our server was friendly and provided service with a smile. I thoroughly enjoyed the mint tea and the way she poured it into the glasses. I was very appreciative that my friends took me out to dinner here, as it certainly was a memorable experience!

On another occasion, I have also visited Cafe Moroc and while the chicken sandwich that I had was nothing special, I couldn't get enough of the fries!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy my experience here. This restaurant has been in business a long, long time. Upon entering I had to bob between a sea of mock necked/polyester people at the cheesy bar/lounge area that looks like it is out of the original Miami Vice. The decor in the restaurant is so tired and cheap looking. The meal was average at best, and I am being really generous. It cost 60 plus dollars, plus the cost of wine. There are alot of other restaurants where you can enjoy a meal at this price in Toronto. I ordered the salad (there was no dressing, just mescaline on a plate.), the crab cakes (from frozen, for sure-they were soggy), steak frites (steak tasted awful, like it had been under a warmer and fries that were covered in spicy paprika- guess that is the \"moroccan\" part) and lava cake (Costco Special). The only good part was the wine and the tea service at the end. The belly dancing was fun, but not enough of a distraction from the mediocre food. I felt like I was at some tourist restaurant in Disneyland. Tacky."}
{"text":"Went here for birthday celebration

I had a decent meal and experience

Had fun watching the birthday boy learn belly dancing

Overall, enjoyed the change in scenery and cuisine"}
{"text":"Found the dining experience less than average when I took an out of town guest here on Friday.  Booking the reservation was extremely annoying as they require you to fill out a one page document and send back to them, I work in a paperless office so I had to go out of my way to print the form and then again to scan and send it back, why they just don't make it an online form is beyond me.  The service was great however the food was substandard, the soup was ok, the beat salad likely the highlight, and the main (Salmon) was cold and looked have been sitting under a heat lamp.  On the flip side the highlight of the evening would definitely be the décor and the belly dancing performance (which I have to note went on 30 minutes late).  All in all if you're looking for great food this is not the place to go, however if you're just looking for unique dining experience it could be the one hit wonder you're looking for."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was very good...  The service on the other hand, was pretty bad. We walked in on a Saturday night without a reservation (party of two) and were told that getting a table would not be an option. Okay, understandable. We asked if we could eat in the bar and were told sit anywhere and menus would be right over. We never saw that person again. While we waited 15 minutes for menus, three separate groups of 3-5 people came in without reservations and were seated within 15 minutes. We moved to the bar to try to get some sort of service. During a 20 minute time there waiting to order, another group of 5 was seated without a reservation. The food when we finally got it was very good. I think there was some sort of belly dancing dinner show in the actual restaurant, that sounded fun, but my wife and I wouldn't know. My wife says that, for the cost, she would not come here again because the experience of a Moroccan restaurant was not part of the price of admission because we had to eat in the bar.  Overall, outstanding food, TERRIBLE service.  What a letdown."}
{"text":"\"The main dining area had lower seating structures reminiscent of tents with thin fabric walls - orange, warm brows and some green colors persisting.\"

\"We walked through the pointed arch entrance and were submerged into the atmosphere right away.\"

\"Shortly after we settled among the cushions, our waiter David came over and offered water as well as a quick rundown of what's good. We followed some of his recommendations Moroccan Cigar (Maftoul), Braised Harigma Beef Cheeks as well as some Hummus and a Lamb Shank.\"

Just a few bites of our full review."}
{"text":"for 3 years in a row, ive called to reserve a birthday party for 10 people, with good intention and hoping to speak to someone with some common sense. 
 Each year i get some rude, \"know it all\" who sends me to their F-ing website, which i know by heart! thats why im calling, to reserve, to ask a question ect. not to be put on hold 5 times, during our 3 minute convo.
...ok...They can reserve it, but cant promise or guarantee a private tent, or even a tent for a party of 10. so thats $40 per person, before drinks, tax and tip.... DO THE MATH....i would like to say to the owners of the sultans tent: YOUR IDIOTS! BUSINESS LOST- YET AGAIN!  Just because you youir cheeping out on hiring some descent staff, with some education, a little manors, and some hint of professionalism! 
how the heck are you so busy?"}
{"text":"We actually were in the lounge part downstairs called BerBer .The staff super friendly and helpful. And they consulted with me on all aspects of the planning.
Had our Office Christmas party there in December.
Enjoyed the belly dancing with the snake, but I was expecting a larger snake than the little Albino Boa she had. I think it was a new one.
The food was great.
We had a party of 40 people and only 2 waiters, which was a little weird. But it worked out I guess. Our wait wasn't too long for our food. And normally waiting means they are making it fresh.
My one complaint: the crab cakes were oily. And our seats were too close together which made for uncomfortable, awkward eating.
Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Ever wonder what Morocco has to offer? Get transported into an experience worth sharing! 
As you walk in, you escape the city and soak yourself into the Arabian Nights of The Sultan's Tent. The atmosphere of the dim lighting, soft music and large Moroccan tents surrounding each table setting makes you forget where you are. 

I was fortunate enough to have been visiting the city for my friend's bachelorette party. We decided to start our night here for dinner and drinks. I've never had Moroccan food before. Our group of ladies instantly felt transformed into this exotic vision before the food and drinks even came! There's such a vast selection of food & drinks to choose from! It was a fusion of French & Moroccan cuisine and the outcome could not have been more magical! I had chosen the 3 course Pre-Fixe menu. As my appetizer, I got the Moroccan Crab Cake. It had a good spice to it paired with a creamy aioli. The crab cake was cooked perfectly with a crisp coating. I wish it came with 3 crab cakes, cause 1 just left me craving for more! I tried the Short Rib Tagines with a beef reduction demi glace, mixed veggies and couscous. It was total perfection as the short ribs just fell apart in my mouth. The flavours and hint of heat were an amazing combination! My friend ordered the Seafood Royale and my gosh, thank goodness we were all sharing our dishes! If you enjoy seafood, this is a must! The shrimp, calamari & mussels on a bed of rice with a savoury broth was absolutely delightful. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I wasn't able to try the desserts on the menu. They gave me a substitute dessert of fruit and pastries. I was very impressed at how often the Chef would stop by delivering the food and ensuring he explained the choices to us especially since we had a few dietary restrictions at our table. It was rewarding at how flexible they were and still managed to create such a magical experience for us. During dinner, they had a belly dancer share her moves to the crowd of diners. She was beautifully skilled and even engaged people to try out her moves! The girls and I got up and tried it out ourselves. It was a great touch to an overall amazing night!

The traditional décor is on point to the historical beauty and draws you in to their rich culture. The service shown was exceptional and was able to pamper us with such luxury. For those who have never tried Moroccan cuisine, step into this lavish banquet setting and dive into such mouth watering dishes. I highly recommend this location! Be captured in the aroma and touch of elegance at The Sultant's Tent!"}
{"text":"The restaurant appears clean and the decor is nice. My group of 12 was seated quickly and on-time for our reservation. We ordered some drinks ($10-ish... gross). While looking at the menus to order the food three members of our group began jumping out of their chairs and making a commotion. Turns out they had seen a mouse run by. When the waiter came back they told him. He didn't seem at all surprised and offered to move us to the other side of the restaurant. I didn't see it myself, but that's crazy. Not off to a good start.

For the first course I had the soup. It was bland tomato soup with a sparse sprinkle of chickpeas. I then squeezed the provided lemon into the bowl and that perked it up a bit. It was edible but not something I would order again. For the second course I got the chevre brulee ($3.95 additional). It was the best course. The cheese was salty and delicious. It was served with a sweet onion jam that really complimented the cheese. For the main I had the steak frites. The steak was mostly gristle but the few meaty bits were delicious and were surprisingly cooked to the right temperature (I ordered medium rare but with a  thin 6 oz steak I was skeptical they would get it right). The fries were just fries. For the dessert I had creme brulee ($3.95 extra). It was deliciously creamy and vanilla flavored. The brulee part was thin and crisp and gave a satisfying crack with the whack of a spoon. The food wasn't super impressive. I would have been very happy paying $30 for it given the quality but $48 was too much. Luckily work paid for it so I don't feel I lost anything. 

The staff members were friendly and knowledgeable explaining little tidbits about Moroccan food and culture. I do wish they'd put on a better show about the mouse ordeal, though. At least act like it's not a usual occurrence. 

The show is pretty lame. One poor, lone lady is forced to wiggle down the hallway for 20 minutes or so. Luckily my group contained some adventurous souls who joined here in dancing. The should have two or three dancers, more colorful costumes, I dunno, it just wasn't exciting. (I want to be clear I'm commenting on the whole show concept, the actual dancing was fine and the dancer was friendly and encouraging).

I'd go back again for a work event or something but I wouldn't go on my own dime."}
{"text":"Went last light June 24th and thought we'd try something different. The atmosphere sounded inviting and I'm no stranger to Moroccan cuisine 
Well, that was a cutesy however a poor attempt at a themed restaurant. 
Where do I begin? 
It has all the trapping a tourist and no offence but one which little cultural experience may appreciate. 
The food was awful, and the a 1/2 bottle of a Pinot Grigio was that undrinkable. 
Ok so maybe it's the belly dancing entertainment ? Nope two ladies one was ok the other completely inexperienced. 
Oh well its for the tourists but desert can't be bad. 
I had the chocolate tart - via a vis Presidents choice frozen deserts . But the kicker was the Baklava I wondered if it was made in house and our waiter told it was a third party desert. Mmmm I say this without exaggerating. - this was the worst Baklava I have ever seen. Dry hard tasteless really unreal how they could serve it. The waiter suggested we should have exotic dishes we don't get at home well I've amazing Baklava from the Persian and Middle East bakeries her and in the Mid East and this was too much. The straw that broke the camels back. 
We would  never return to this restaurant and given the cost 55 x2 prix fixe and 22$ 1/2 bottle with tax and gratuities 150 approx. 
not recommended. Such wasted potential.."}
{"text":"Six of us went for the Winterlicious menu. We arrived in time for our 8:00pm reservation.  By 8:15 we had ordered drinks and our meal. 
Our drinks arrived at 8:55pm. After some time, we had to ask where our dinner was. Eventually they brought the appetizers. The mushroom soup was good. The hummus and Moroccan cigars were not great. We had to send the first plate of hummus back because it was already dried out from standing so long. 
When the entrees arrived, four of them were cold.   We had the beef cheeks which were good, and the lamb stew which was just ok. 
Everyone had the crepes for dessert and they were not fantastic. 
The service was slow and seemed almost ineffective. It certainly was not worth the 18% gratuity that they put on top of the bill. 
Overall, a disappointing dining experience and not worth near the price."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends. We had fun because of the dancers, who were terrific, and our server was great but everything else was DREADFUL...
The decor ( tables, chairs, rugs, setup) was tired and uncomfortable, reminiscent of a creepy dark 80's steak house. The bathroom was dirty and had a spooky TV mirror in it advertising Toyota?
But worst of all, the food was horrible. My soup (billed as tomato broth was more like flavourless tomato sludge) , a seafood paella that was not a paella at all ( some chewy squid rings and a couple of shrimps in a watery broth ? ) A friend's vegetable tagine was bland and inedible. 
No options on dessert, a grocery store cupcake, which I couldn't bear to eat. And for some odd reason a chocolate macaron boxed on each table? With 2 drinks the bill came to over $120 per person, which I think is the worst value I've had in a Toronto restaurant in a decade. With the Moroccan theme and some creativity and decent skill in the kitchen this could really be a great experience. 
As it was I think management is riding the wave of captive destination guests who come for a night out as a group so are not as discerning, milking them for maximum $ and serving some of the worst food on offer in this great foodie city. Sort of felt like this when I went to the Captain Johns boat for dinner years ago for the \"experience\"... And we all know how that sank"}
{"text":"My date brought me here, at first we got lost LOL shame on us but then we finally found it. The setting is dark, arabian nights theme. Candles and pillows everywhere. Its quite romantic. We came here for dinner, you can either choose from the dinner for 2 special or regular. We got the dinner for 2. its 40$ per person. You basically get to choose one side from each section, app, main and dessert. I dont remember the names exactly of the dishes we got.. but i remember getting one of the soups, tasted amazing and comes in a large bowl, vegetarian friendly. main dish was this vegetable platter and dessert was creme brûlée, soooo tasty. Since its Moroccan cuisine, I wouldn't recommend vegetarian or vegans to come here because your options are very limited. The menu is pretty meat heavy with all the ground beef based dishes but from what I had, the food was delish and very filling.

We also paired everything with white wine( forgot the name once again) LOL

and during ur main dish, you have belly dancers performing to a few songs for entertainment."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

OK, Summerlicious! You have regained your reputation! I have had a change of heart after last night's Yelp UYE organized by Viviana M.

$25 for a 3-course that you choose to your liking. These are my choices and their verdict:

MAFTOUL - \"Moroccan Cigars\"
Sorry - NOT the kind you smoke! You get not one, but TWO crispy rolls with stuffed with cinnamon, savory beef and aiola sauce. Possibly the best dish here!

KESKESU CASABLANCA - Vegetarian Tagine
In Morocco the tagine sauce is made with 46 spices. I don't think that is true here, because this dish was missing something. So this is where I knocked a star. \"Tagine\" is THE most popular Moroccan dish, so they need to perfect it! Don't get me wrong, is was good, just not great. The dish is a HUGE plate of couscous loaded with veggies (zucchini, tomatoes, squash, red peppers) but the tomato flavour in the sauce was a little overpowering. Didn't exactly taste like what I had in Morocco, perhaps adding some meat to this dish would really add to the flavour. Two words : come hungry! 

BRULEE ROYAL - Vanilla Creme Brûlée
OMG! Rich, creamy, smooth - it was surprisingly light and not too sweet. Get this!

Having been to Morocco last year, the decor and ambiance of this place really wisked me back to those days wandering through the medina, strolling along palm-tree-lined streets, and dinner nights with belly dancing at fancy riads! If you have never been to Morocco, you don't need to go far to get the jist!

Yes, that's right - there is live belly dancing - but make sure you make reservations for the \"Berber Lounge\" in the back! Our \"yelpy\" group of 10 tonite left agreeing we'll be back here to check that out ... and perhaps Bobby N. will finally find the courage to dance for us instead of rushing out after dinner!"}
{"text":"Stay away!!! 

This place is so overrated... don't know why! 
 
1- The food sucks: I don't think they know what spices are. 

2- Service sucks: One lady looking after 15 tables. 

3- Very very overpriced: On weekends they have a minimum spend of $55 per person. On top of that, everything on the menu is way overpriced.

4- There is nothing Moroccan about their Moroccan tea. As a matter of fact, it has a funny taste and we all had a funny feeling after trying it... weird!! 

5- Belly dancer is good but she danced for maybe 20 minutes. 

If you are there for the belly dancer experience, go somewhere else where the food is good and reasonably priced. I recommend tabule. 

Sultan's tent has nice atmosphere, nice music and nice lighting but that is about it."}

- belly dancer was very good - but kinda short - dancer moves around - mostly for photo ops - gets people up to dance"}

Food was nothing spectacular. I ordered the seafood paella and for the price you pay for it you get surprisingly very little.

We got there at 11:30 am which was the advertised start time but the actual entertainment only started a little after 1. When you are dealing with toddlers that kind of delay is brutal!!

The upside of getting there early was that we didn't have to wait too long for our food. I noticed that patrons that showed up closer to 12 were waiting over 40 minutes for their food.

The hummus from the kid's appetizer menu was delicious. Everything else was mediocre at best.

The entertainment was extremely disorganized and unprofessional. For 2 adults and 2 kids you are looking at about 150$ so would not consider this money well spent and would not recommend this event.

2 stars because both the food and entertainment missed the mark."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other reviewers, but the food, atmosphere, waitress, and belly dancer were great, I'd go back any time. Maybe they stepped up their game since the last folks have been here."}
{"text":"Horrible, disrespectful manager and staff. Spent 2 months organizing a surprise birthday as host to 13 guests. 13 people of which four of them never ate. I Spent $2,000 (yes $2,000) for the worst service, the worst treatment you could imagine. Georgio Stefanopoulos, the manager was the rudest, worst customer service person I've ever met. All he cared about was his Root canal problem and chit chatting with his friends. 13 of us were squished in a tent, had platters of tapas preordered, ordered bottles of wine, ordered premium menu items off the prix fixe menu and did not spare any expense. The least we expected was service and respect.  We were pushed out of our room by rude security guards with arms folded like henchmen telling us we had 15 minutes to leave before the next guests arrived. Three times they surrounded our tent warning us we had to leave. Our guests were embarrassed and mortified.  We hadn't finished eating nor did we get dessert or coffee yet. I had to keep reminding the waiter to pour wine and get drinks for my guests. I served the wine myself and kept checking on my guests as they choked down their meals.  After being kicked out of the tent and moved to the front of the restaurant with our 13 guests, 30 minutes of waiting we had no service, no coffees or dessert that were pre-ordered. Guests were sitting waiting 35 minutes. Georgio blamed the coffee machine for making one coffee at a time. I said it's been 30 minutes, we could have had them all made at 5 minutes per coffee by now. He kept making up excuses and lying and treating us like terribly and acted like we were bothering him. That's after spending $2,000. The restaurant wasn't close to full. There was a second manager who heard our complaints and didn't respond.There are so many better places to go. The entertainment is disorganized like other commenters have said. The staff have no idea what they are doing. You run around looking for people for ten minutes at a time to try and get service. We didn't skimp on ordering before dinner drinks, after dinner drinks, bottles of wine, premium selection menu and tapas platters for our guests and still these people couldn't treat us with respect. We spent more than anyone else in the restaurant that night and totally disrespected. We moved on to Bier Markt and BlueBlood Steakhouse that night and the next day and were treated like we deserved. I will never come back to this horrible place or let any of my friends or family support this place."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends. The ambiance was great, leading me to expect great things. Unfortunately the food was a total letdown. The waitress asked us if we wanted to wait and eat during the belly dancing show. We said no, and the food came out 10 minutes later. Not a good sign. I ordered the lamb shank and it was clearly microwaved. Hot on top and ice cold on the bottom. Same for the rice: hot around the edges and cold in the middle. Everyone I was with had the same experience. Considering the cost, microwaved food is completed unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I had the Seafood Royale and it was unbelievable - so delicious.  The staff here were really friendly, our waiter in particular was very attentive and helpful.  The decor was really cool.  This restaurant is a fun place to go to if you're looking for something a little different than your regular pizza or burgers.  Good location, short walk from Union Station."}
{"text":"Moroccan food is one of my favorite foods.  This restaurant is offensive to all things Moroccan.

I have had Moroccan food all over the United States and Europe and this was the worst \"attempt\" I have ever experienced.

I live in Rochester, NY and have been craving Moroccan for some time now.  My boyfriend and I recently went to Toronto and I researched Moroccan restaurants in the area, very excited to introduce my boyfriend to one of my favorite foods.

We decided on the Sultan's Tent because it had the best reviews, not sure why now.  

The place was very gimmicky and it was clear almost from when we sat down that the restaurant exists just to move people in and out and make as much money as possible.  

The food was not awful, but had no taste!  Moroccan food is rich with spices and savory, my chicken tasted like chicken, couscous I have made out of the box had more flavor, etc.  

We kept wondering, do the chefs or owners ever taste what they send out? If yes, how can they allow it?  Toronto street meat was better than this.

At the end of the meal, our water brought out our bill with an extra \"Chicken\" at $17 and it listed more beers than we drank.  I told the waiter of these \"errors\" and his speed in printing out a new bill and his numerous apologies really led us to believe he put these extra items on the bill on purpose, in hopes that we would not notice.  There is not even a $17 chicken on the menu!

We left feeling as though we wasted a night and our money.  
I think I can say this was one of the worst restaurants I have visited in North America - after living in both California and New York and traveling often."}
{"text":"We purchased a deal through TravelZoo and went with another couple.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time.

The atmosphere was fantastic and food was wonderful and just when you didn't think it could get any better... queue the belly dancing show!

What a wonderful evening we had.  So glad we went and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've heard so-so things regarding this place, but my friend wanted to go so I decided to bite the bullet and go with her. We decided to go for their Summerlicious menu thinking it would be cheaper and we could experience an array of items. 

I realize now that this place is a money grab type joint; for instance when we were seated they gave us their standard Prix Fixe menu ($55) for Friday & Saturdays (no a la carte I assumed). We had to request the Summerlicious menu ($45). Now most restaurants promote their Summerlicious menus not hide them from their customers. 

The Summerlicious menu in comparison sucked and really didn't justify the ($45) dollar price tag. Now their normal Prix Fixe menu had more items and a better selection, still most of the items/ingredients didn't justify $55, but we were already seated so no going back now. What bothered me the most about this place was their Prix Fixe menu actually doesn't save you money, in fact it's costing you more! 

I had a crab cake (extra $4.00) + Peri Peri Chicken + Creme Brulee = $59.00 as opposed to their normal menu, which would clock you in around $49.00. Yeah not cool.

I've never had Moroccan food before but I doubt it would taste like anything that I consumed at Sultan's Tent. The food itself was average, nothing special and the portions were small. Nothing had any rich flavour which made me believe the quality of ingredients were sub-par. 

The service was good and attentive, we didn't like the table we were originally seated and asked if we could move, which they kindly accommodated. I ordered the Mockingbird martini which was delicious, the bartender made it with a special twist which tasted amazing. 

However, when I ordered the martini I had viewed a menu that stated it was $8-9 for each. When I got my bill it said otherwise, instead it was $12 per martini! The waitress informed me they recently changed their menus and that I had received the old menu. They didn't honour the price I had originally seen which was disappointing. 

What you really pay for at this place is the ambiance and the belly dancing, nothing more. The belly dancing was a nice distraction from the food, but I've seen better belly dancing. I think they have different belly dancers who come in so maybe it was just a bad night. However, they were fun and went around to a few tables and got people up to belly dance. Despite the entertainment I still can't justify spending that much money on okay food and okay belly dancing. The only thing that saves this place is the ambiance and drinks, but make sure you get the updated drink menu!"}
{"text":"Food was fat and greasy I got the rack of lamb..Service was slow and lazy. They took an automatic 18% tip which is  a robbery. The dancers were nothing special. 
Highly not recommended."}
{"text":"Part ONE of happy hour Thursdays in the St Lawrence Market area was a blast, and to start things off we decided to go to Sultan's Tent.  I've been here before and as always the Moroccan Moorish themed is lovely.  Luckily for us the place was empty so we decided to sit by the bar. The servers and service was extremely prompt and courteous.  
In little to no time, we had our glasses of Castillo de Monseran Garnacha (Spain) ...definitely need to add this to my collection of wines now haha.... 
After a few mins our Hummus dip with olives had been serve. 4/5
In House made hummus, perfect blend of ingredients served with crispy pita bread was lovely, Luckily for those who could never decided black or green olives, this dish incorporated both...so PLUS in my books.  

ill be back here again. just got to watch the belly dancing performance ;)"}
{"text":"Classy, unique and the atmosphere is just perfect. You gonna love their food. Specially their appetizers. As i always say go in a group so you get to try different food or you gonna go home regretting why you didnt order the second one on the left next to one you ordered. Hahahaahah. Trust me."}
{"text":"This place is definitely more about the experience than the food.  Everything tasted like it was bulk prepared, it didn't have much flavour like real Moroccan food.  Even though I felt  like I was being transported to Morocco with the decor and belly dancers, I was disappointed by the food. We ordered the 3 course meal and I had the chevre, lamb leg and creme Brulee. My lamb was so bland, unfortunately.   My friend had the beef cheeks which was the most flavourful of everyone's meal, if I went back I would get that next time. The belly dancers were great! Get up and dance with them!"}
{"text":"Came for workday lunch with my father with a special Work Perk deal for a $15 3 course meal. The restaurant was completely empty besides one other table.

The meal started off beautifully. We ordered a pot of MINT TEA which was poured artfully and served in beautiful little glasses. It was sweet and delicious. Highly reccomend! 

For apps, he had MAFTOUL CIGARS which were flaky and tasty. I had the HARIRA SOUP, hearty and savoury with a nice kick. Awesome. 

For the main, my father had the MANGO SALMON. He liked it. 

I had the STEAK BAGUETTE which was kind of a fail; what a shame. It was very well done--to me, inedible. I sent it back (I have never sent food back) and asked for it to be done medium. Unfortunately the second steak I received had barely a trace of pink in it; it was the dark side of medium-well.  Couldn't imagine sending it back again, so I dug in. I found it to be tasty but tough, maybe because it was not cooked to my liking. The toughness of the meat and the fact that it was served open-face on very dense bread made it very difficult to cut and consume. I struggled a bit with a few methods (dad found this entertaining; I did not). When I eventually got it into my mouth, it was actually really tasty! 
Reccomendations for the kitchen: cut the steak into thin slices. Quicker to cook, easier to eat on an open face sandwhich. Just makes sense. Oh, and learn how to cook a steak you guys were not even CLOSE! http://www.colinmcnulty.com/blog/images/cook-a-steak-blue-rare-medium-welldone.jpg

We finished with Morroccan cookies. What appeared to be a selection of different  cookies was actually three of the exact same--sort of like shortbread-- except in different shapes and cooking times (the brown one was just an overdone version of the white one!!). Good one Cafe Moroc, hilarious actually, but you're not fooling anyone! 

The lunch took an hour and a half. This is kind of silly for the financial district, and considering there were only four patrons in the restaurant, totally unacceptable. 
Great price + some great food + poor service + terrible steak = Meh. Don't go for lunch."}
{"text":"Okay okay, I know a lot of people who have reviewed this place had some distaste towards it, but I had my first Sultan's Tent experience this past weekend and I have to say that it was a good one!

I have heard of Sultan's Tent for years and finally got a chance to try it this weekend when my friends and I got together for dinner.

All four of us love being HUGE Toronto foodies, so it was natural for us to try Sultan's Tent because it was a new resto for all of us.

I always a palette for unique food, so my SET MENU, four course meal definitely hit the spot!

For my first course, I started out light with the Harira, which is a tomato soup with a mixture of chick peas, kidney beans, lentils and a ton of Moroccan spice.

For my second course, I ordered the Maftoul, which was INCREDIBLE! Maftoul is a hand rolled Moroccan cigar stuffed with spiced beef, cashews and raisins - all topped with a delicious chipotle aioli!

For my third course, I ordered the Coucous Royale, which is a savory and spicy mixture of chicken, spicy non-pork sausage, grilled lamb chops and is nicely paired with root veggies. This dish was to die for! So much flavour and such amazing tastes all mixed together

To top off my amazing meal, I ordered the Brulee Royale as my dessert and fourth and final course. I am such a sucker for creme brule and am always searching for it wherever I go, so this was such a sweet treat! It was literally so sweet and creamy!


Yes, I can admit that the set menu price of at least $40 can be pricey and that the belly dancing show only consists of ONE belly dancer at a time.

However, it is a nice cultural experience and an interesting food experience.

I do recommend this to people looking to mix up their typical dining out routine and try something a little bit different with a little more spice!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch yesterday and had an amazing time. The server was wonderful and attentive, and the food was flavourful. I ordered the steak baguette with cafe greens and thoroughly enjoyed it. I must say that the ambience was my favourite part of the experience, they've really hit the nail on the head in terms of setting. I am definitely going back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here for a Yelp UYE organized by Viviana M. I've eaten here  before and was looking forward to the experience of interacting with and getting to know other Yelpers.

I ordered the Harira soup (a minestrone broth), the braised lamb and the creme brulle. The braised lamb was tender, exquisite and well seasoned! It was served on top a bed of (filling) couscous and grilled carrots and red peppers. It was delicious!  I love creme brulle and this edition found here did not disappoint.

The atmosphere was very pleasant and conversations were enjoyable. I had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Last evening uur courteous and friendly server informed us towards the end of the meal that the place was under new management. The poor reviews here are a result of a previous era of the restaurant which clearly has now ended. Last time I went, I thought, maybe I shouldn't come back. But I was in the area so we came three of us and decided to try again. The show had THREE dancers, all engaging. The food came at a good pace and was DELICIOUS. We had the rack of lamb, lamb shank which the server told us was a new recipe and just delicious, and a tagine. New wine menu, food menu, and all servers I did not remember from last time equalled a truly remarkable experience that I wish to repeat. Clearly they want to start something new and amazing. You could really tell. Our server had great suggestions, helped my girlfriend get all the extra desserts she desired. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I get that it is a show and dinner but that doesn't mean you should charge these prices. The dinner was mediocre and the \"show\" was a single girl belly dancing around to different tables. 

If you come here for summerlicious or winterlicious don't expect much as you will be seated in the \"cafe\" section near the entrance that basically seems like a glamorized coffee shop with a long bar. Tiny, two person round tables and a decor that has a Moroccan theme but  very far from being a portal to Morocco. White chairs and a mirror is what you get. The Yelp picture of the door is the exact size of their \"cafe\". 

I came for summerlicious but decided that this \"experience\" wasn't for me. So I \"upgraded\" to the back, I found this process similar to getting a lap dance as you pay more and the lady with the shiny clothes leads you towards the darker area with long couches, pillows, and funky music. Very VIP room like.

The decor in the back was laid out quite nicely. Separate tents for each dining table. I use the term dining table loosely as these dining table are the same size as those tiny coffee tables at the front but cost $15 a head more. The lighting is very dim and not a window in sight. There are fake plants scattered around and cool looking palm leaf ceiling fans.

Service was pretty dismal as you are confronted with the smug, sarcastic, and slightly too cool actor type of server. He was nice but not very engaging or personable. Although, he did have extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very quick, so quick that I found it hard to ask any questions or for a water refill as his back would be turned and his feet walking away the instant you see him.

Food, this is where the restaurant pissed me off. Complete failure. Every single dish sounded appetizing and interesting but the execution of these dishes were done so sloppily. Too salty, no flavor, over cooked, underdone, the list goes on. I find this food similar to food found in banquet halls. Dishes created on a large scale and then plated separately. There was a large amount of food but no dish sticks out in my mind as being done well. A shame especially considering the price.

The belly dance, the supposed star of the show. It's a girl dancing around with a short vest on. Really, I've had better food and seen better dancing at a strip club. I wasn't looking for anything spectacular but the mix of poor food and service didn't excite me enough for a mediocre belly dance to entertain me. Then they kick you out once dessert comes because there's another \"booking\". They book tables based on the belly dance so everyone eats around the same time and gets kicked around the same time so the turnover goes quickly.

Overall, it was a waste of money and I will never go back. $45/head and extra cost for the appetizing menu options that barely taste of anything good? I'll pass, thanks. Take the money you would've spent here and go to Pravda across the street, you'll leave with a nice buzz off premium vodka."}
{"text":"The food is okay.  The belly dancing is good.
The service is weak. The staff are nice enough but they are poorly trained, unprofessional and lack some of the basics in terms of service. (ie: seating  checking on tables, clearing empty plates, offering a second round of beverages, offering desert or coffee, bringing the bill). We probably will not come back."}
{"text":"ok, so... I seriously LOVE this place!
The first time I went was actually on a 1st date... LOL but each time I went after it has only gotten better. It really does make you feel like you're in Casablanca! Amazing atmosphere... great food (lots of options), awesome drinks and the bathrooms are beautiful!! makes for fun pictures! I always have a great time there :)!!"}
{"text":"Sultan's Tent, great idea for a different dinner experience.  You show up at the right time there is a belly dancing show.

If i could i would give it a 3.5 star.

So I ended up going on a random night during the week, when it was quiet.  You would figure the show wouldn't be the best as its the slow night, but that was the highlight.  The dancer was good, and sweet, very interactive.  She even got people to join her in a semi lesson.   That part was a solid 5 star.  

The ambiance was cool as well.

Our waiter did not look very happy, and honestly was not that great...he was slow, looked miserable, just not wanting to be there.  Now this was a pricer place to eat, not your Jack Astors, so you would expect more of a friendlier server.  (and I'm not picky, i  have tons of server friends so i am biased, in fact i let more slide than normal)

Drinks were made well and delicious, not much to say about that.

The Apps we ordered were beef, chicken and shrimp on a stick....very small, bad presentation, and over cooked.

My meal was a short rib.  Now the short rib was cooked beautifully , it just melted off the bone.  The problem was it was very fatty.   The waiter recommended the rice, and that was not enjoyable.  I know it wasn't minute rice, but it sure tasted like it.   Veggies was meh. 

Date had the chick peas tangine, which was good.  Not mind blowing good.  But good.

Creme brule for dessert...never can hate on that.

I would come here once in a while for the show if any thing, maybe for a birthday, but not just for the sake of eating.  try it once for the show and your good.

Total bill for 3 drinks, 1 app, 2 mains, 1 desert was 124 before tax and tip."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were great. But unfortunately thee service was terrible. We had to ask for our server three different times. Furthermore, we had to ask him to clear the table and to refill our water several times."}
{"text":"Bland, dry food and an underwhelming show. Sure the belly dancer was good, but there was only one dancing around the different tables, which felt kind of awkward. Four courses for 40 dollars is the only option, and if you want to stray from the 2 or 3 options offered per course everything costs extra. 
2 stars because of the decor and friendly waitress, but not worth the money for what you get, which is dried out food that seems as if it has been sitting around all day."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. We went for summerlicious, excited to finally try this place and feel ripped off . 48/ person for bland , salty greasy food  ... Maybe it would be different with regular menu, but everything seemed very mass produced and like it had been sitting for a while . My appy actually came with ingredients that weren't advertised. The tent we were in , well nicely decorated was cramped and really hot . It was an uncomfortable experience . Staff also very aloof and didn't seem like they cared if we were there or not . Won't be back"}
{"text":"If you go here, it's for the bellydancing only.

The food is mediocre at best. It's very expensive and they have \"upgrade options\" which are extra. (they are sneaky about it, with very small font)

The bellydancing was fun to watch. But would it have killed them to do right by the food? Not even worth it to get into specifics here."}
{"text":"Our student group did a end-of-year dinner here and it was fantastic! The staff were all amazingly flexible and accommodating during the planning of the event and were all friendly and efficient during the event. The party came up to ~130 people but the Berber room in the basement was a nice size for dinner and dancing.

The food was delicious with generous portion sizes. We opted for the 3-course meal and gave every guest choices for each course. The staff were very accommodating of allergies and people who were arriving late to the event.

The decor is beautiful and every spot was a good spot for photographs! The space goes from a cozy room to a party room at the flip of a light switch. We had lots of people say that they loved the look of the venue after the event!

We loved it!"}
{"text":"I ate off the Summerlicious prix fixe menu. The duck breast salad was a little dry, the braised lamb could've used more spicing and flavor and the accompanying sweet potatoes were water logged. The lamb wasn't bland per se, but since it was braised, it should've had more flavor and the sauce should've been better spiced with a more concentrated flavor. The creme brulee was good."}
{"text":"Had the \"Amazigh Vegetables\" and it was simply amazing, must say. First when I heard Chickpea stew, I wasn't very thrilled but the waiter suggested it was good. Normally I don't go by what the waiters suggest but this time I decided to. And I don't regret. One of the best meals I have had in a long time. Spices were just right and the stew was as it said - with lots of vegetables. Started off with Mango Marrash, another must have drink. 

It was late in the afternoon so hardly crowded. Dinner starts at 5pm so 3.30pm for late lunch worked out just great. Ended with Mint tea and some delicious desserts. 

Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are not Moroccan, which is fine, but don't call yourself \"authentic Moroccan\" and then serve me something I can get at Jack Astor's for half the price.

When I visited I had the beef stew, which was really tasty and a good portion for lunch. 

However, this place is overpriced. I ordered a glass of wine on a whim and it turns out, HA(!), it was $12. And it was just white wine. Nothing fancy. 
(perhaps that was my bad, but still). 

This place is a good one to take someone to on a first date, because there is enough showy stuff (whispy tents, high pouring tea and bellydancers) to distract you (or your date) if things aren't going well."}
{"text":"I was there on our last night for a TESOL conference recently with two friends from CT. I was a little disappointed that we didn't sit on the floor nor eat with our fingers. However, we were delighted with the Asian belly dancer. We had prixe fix dinner. I had their tomato based vegetable soup to start, then lamb shank with rice, and ending with the sweet bakalav. I also had Moroccan Mimosa for a drink. I observed that even two little girls loved and danced the belly dancing with the dancer. Don't get me wrong, the belly dancer was great. She had a fantastic stomach muscle that I admired as a woman. The men were the busboys and brought in the dishes. The ladies were the servers. They were attentive and knowledgeable. Good job!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for my birthday dinner, and originally I was going to order the Cote de Boeuf, but my server had recommended the beef cheek saying it was the exact same thing... However, it was not the same thing(the descriptions of the 2 items on the menu were not similar to each other at all)), and I really regretted getting it. I just did not like the texture of how the beef cheek and after a while  the curry flavour kind of just got old to me. 

That being said, I really enjoyed the rack of lamb that my dad got, so I recommend that for anyone wondering what to get. The waiters were very nice and helpful, the price is a bit on the expensive side and the belly dancing was OK, It's great to watch at first but you kind of get over it after a while so that makes it kind of not worth it for the price. All in all, I do believe this is a good place to eat if you are looking for good moroccan food but remember to stick with your gut when choosing what you want to eat ;)"}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I'd give it 3.5 stars if half stars were possible.

Staff: They were friendly to start but as the evening wore on, there were plenty of delays. They took our initial orders pretty quick and the food came at a decent pace. Unfortunately when it came to our dessert orders and our bill it took an extra 20 to 30 minutes each so it prolonged our dining experience.

Ambience: I loved the décor. They have these structures with cushions and pillows that made for a quieter experience. Vibrant colours all around made for a very cozy and comfortable experience. They also had a belly dancer come during out meal to perform and we even got to participate which was quite fun actually.

Food: The menu could be ordered a la carte or you could do a 3-course pre-fixe menu. I ended up doing the pre-fixe menu. I started with the Crab Cakes which were nothing special and I felt overcharged since you had to add $4.00 more. They tasted like any old crab cakes, and there were only two on the plate! For the main I had the North African Peri Peri Chicken. I was a huge fan of this dish, since the chicken was so juicy and flavourful. I'm salivating just thinking about it again. For dessert I wanted the Baklava but we were told they had no more so I decided to go for the Sweet Keskesu which is coucous with a crème anglaise. It was very heavy with the coucous and I did not enjoy it. It felt like I was eating plain coucous after a while because there wasn't a lot of crème anglaise.

I think I liked the experience of the restaurant more than the food which is quite unfortunate. But there are some good dishes that are worth a try."}
{"text":"Decor-Amazing

Belly-dancing-a bit short but very good

Service-on the slower side but friendly

The best steak I've had in Toronto.

A bit expensive but for a special occasion like a birthday it's an interesting alternative."}
{"text":"Went on a tuesday with 3 other people... place was nice enough and had proff staff but the food was kinda blah... apps were very blah... the chicken tagine was dry... the braised beef was very good though... but one dish out of 8 isnt great.. (4 apps and 4 mains)... too bad there arnt too many morrocan places in town..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sultan's last week and didn't like it at all. I guess our expectations were too high, but the food was mediocre, the service was slow, and the price too high. The only bright spot was belly dancer, she was really good. The funniest thing was watching men during belly dancing performance :-)"}
{"text":"We went to the Sultans tent with another couple and had a very good time. The Moroccan food was very good and coupled with the desert tent style dining room it was truly memorable.

Midway through the evening belly dancers file into the dining room and dance for the room completing the Arabian Nights feel. If you are looking for a fun place to go by yourselves or even better with a group try it."}
{"text":"The only thing this restaurant has going for it is the atmosphere. 

I found this place highly over-priced for the quality of food and quantity you receive. 

I had the fixe menu, MEH..

1.beef cigars--bland, no thought given to presentation. 
2. Chicken tagline-meh, boring, no flavour, 
3. creme brûlée, not very Moroccan 

Discovered many of the food isn't prepared on the site..the chick pea salad isn't even dressed on site, The baklava is not made on site either. 

There are better moroccan food places in Toronto."}
{"text":"We went here for a bachelorette party!

The decor is beautiful, just as the restaurant's name, private tables makes you feel like you're in a tent. The staff were superb however we had an issue with our reservation that had been made 1 month prior to our event for 27 people....it was non existent 0_O. 

We had called 3-4 hours before we were going to show up just to verify if they offered any dishes without a certain ingredient due to food allergies,we also decided to confirm our reservation & then had to deal with a confused staff. After multiple phone calls & advising them that they should expect 27 people to show up at 7:30 on a Thursday night, all was well.

Street parking or paid garage is available.

I started off with the royal brochette, the meat was overcooked & truly unimpressive. I choose the peri peri chicken as my second course, it was ok but not memorable, the lamb dishes did look delicious. Seeing as I wasn't impressed with the first 2 dishes I didn't chance dessert. I had 2 gin & tonics instead! Wound up with a 75$ bill & saw 1 belly dancer come out for 5 minutes total.

I've had much better Moroccan food back home in Montreal,I would not return or recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dined here with a party of 7 mid-January. The ambiance and decor is lavish, theatrical, and very fun - like we've walked into an Indiana Jones movie! Also the belly dancers! And crazy portions of food served by amazingly knowledgeable and hard-working staff! And they surprised us with a tiny birthday cake that looked like an adorable fez hat!

But why the 2 stars? Four of us later fell ill when we got home, experiencing varying degrees of nausea and vomiting. (We didn't drink heavily, nor did we eat elsewhere that night.)

Those who had gotten sick had eaten the braised beef ribs (which was thoroughly slow-cooked to perfection) so I'm fairly certain it was the side of mashed potatoes, which arrived cold on my plate, and likely had some milk/cream that had gone bad. 

I haven't read any other cases of gastro-poisoning, so I'm sure it was an isolated incident. But still a deeply unfortunate way to end an otherwise entertaining evening."}
{"text":"It's a funky place that seems to promise so much (when you walk in) but falls somewhat short of delivering on that promise.

If you have a friend visiting you in TO and you want to take them to an interesting place (besides the usual touristy stuff), this should fit the bill. Belly dancers, Moroccan dishes and decor, this is something you don't typically expect to find in Toronto's downtown core.

There is a decent variety of main courses, from $17 to around $30. Some almost beg you to get a side, which would set you back by another $5. 

I felt that my dish was way over-seasoned. I can't remember the name of it but it was lamb cooked in a special Moroccan ceramic dish with a tall ceramic cover. It would be great if it wasn't for all the extra salt they put into it.

So, overall, I don't think I would come here again on my own but I may bring an out-of-towner to show off an unusual spot."}
{"text":"Luckily we were forewarned about the extravagant prices that the 'tent' would charge just for din lights and a bellydancer. 

Instead we opted for a window seat which worked out quite well as we were attended to all night during service.  Forgot the exact name of my dish but it had a nice portion of chicken and sausage though the taste was a bit on the bland side.  Chicken was dry as well - is this the moroccan style of cooking chicke? Beats me but I felt that the chicken could've been done so much better. 

Entrees were between 15 and 30 - slightly on the pricier end but worth a trip if you are feeling adventurous and have never tried Moroccan cuisine."}
{"text":"Certainly ok to check out for something different, but not some place I would return to.

It is creatively decorated, and offers a feeling of more intimacy even with large table groups.  Our wait staff weren't interactive with the table, and with so many tables being served at once, (they have timed seating's in order to accommodate the belly dance shows) refills and clearing of empty plates was weak.

I don't even remember the food, but sure remember the bill."}
{"text":"It was our first time having Moroccan food and we enjoyed it. The appetizers were great. We had the hummus and pita and the chickpea salad. I loved the chickpea salad and the hummus. The pita was over cooked so it was hard and too crunchy - we just avoided it. For the main, we had the vegetable tagine and the chickpea tagine. The chickpea tagine wasn't on their lunch menu but I asked the waiter and he said they would make it for us. I preferred the flavour of the vegetable tagine, but both were good. The tagines came with cold pita pieces, which should have been heated up a little bit so that they're easier to eat. Or maybe that's just how they always serve the pita with tagines. The cold pita was better than the overcooked pita for sure. 

For dessert, we got the chocolate tart and the creme brulee. We didn't like the creme brulee at all. It was in a tiny little container and it tasted only like I was eating sugar. The chocolate tart was delicious though.

We enjoyed the performance as well. The dancer was very talented and she seemed to be having fun."}
{"text":"I was here last night. After walking by on several occasions prior to. I decided it would be a great spot to take my mom, for a family meal. The ambiance looks nice, and well, the food.... Experience something new, right? Given the ambiance, I would think the food would be just as great... Think again Natasza. I was sorely disappointed to say the very least.... Here is my run down....

A $3.00 charge on filtered water, Really? This mere fact was not even conveyed to us properly. But just showed up on our bill. I could get filtered water for free, at home.....Thank-you very much. In fact, I had some with me. 

Five coconut shrimp..... $12. You've got to be kidding me...... While it was delicious, especially paired with their mango chutney..... A $12 appetizer, not impressed and that's to start off the \"wonderful and elaborate\" meal the ambiance boasts, all on it's own. I think not. 

The hummus plate was good. That was slightly over priced as well, but 7 bucks, I can deal with. After all the hummus was so tasty that one could eat it with a spoon and there was plenty of the hummus to go around... Far more than the pita to go with it, that's for sure.

There was a French- Fries appetizer we had gotten, they were good, in small doses. French- Fries at supposedly \"authentic\" places, simply, perturbs me though.

My meal wasn't that great, but it was loaded with veg, which I liked. Although it was rather typical of a felafel joint, I would have expected it to be incredibly delicious coming from a place like the Sultan's Tent, it wasn't. The pita \"bread\" was so dry,  I am sure it could have cut through ice if I wanted it to, and they don't even give you a choice of whole wheat or white, BIG no-no! 

The meal my sister got... Steak with French-Fries (I don't remember what it was actually called)....half the.... wait, let me correct that, three quarters of the plate was French-Fries.... After having the small portion of French-Fries earlier,  no more was needed. PERIOD. And again,  Really? Such grand and eloquent Moroccan food we are eating. French fries = Filler food.  I didn't know it was such a fine delicacy in Morocco? Hmmm, I wonder what they will think in France. Thankfully, we had a very good server that managed to get a replacement salad, while allowing us to keep the French frites on/ at our table. Top-notch points, as this was superb.

Both my brother and my mom, our special guest, opted for the Couscous Royale, which he loved,  and the Chicken Marakesh, for my mom. The chicken was delicious, I tried some myself. 

We didn't get dessert because we were too full. But I think this was a good decision.

My mom also very much enjoyed her two beers she had, wonderful.

Not to leave on a completely poor note.

Service: 6
Food: 4
Ambiance: 9 1/2
Over-all: 2 out of 5 stars, I will not be returning to the Sultan's Tent, at least not for a fully fledged meal. (So much for not ending on a poor note, eh?)"}
{"text":"I came here last night for the Summerlicious with a friend and I was not disappointed in spite of my fears.  The place was quite busy for an early dinner (6 pm) on a Monday night! The reviews on here are a mixed bag, but I made a point to avoid the chicken and Moroccan \"treats\" from the dessert menu. Thanks for the tips ;-)

We ordered the following and I've included descriptions from the menu:

MAFTOUL - \"Hand rolled \"Moroccan Cigars\", hot crispy pastry stuffed with a mixture of mildly spiced beef, cashews and raisins, topped with our chipotle aioli.\" 

- I was hoping for more with this app. The serving size was tiny and the flavor wasn't as rich as I expected. It was okay, but next time I'd probably order the salad with duck slices, which my friend ordered.


MOROCCAN BEEF SHORT RIB - \"Tender fall off the bone beef braised with Moroccan spices, finished with a rich red wine demi-glace, served with Yukon gold-parsnip mash, accompanied by mini Casablanca vegetables\"  

- This was deceptively filling; the plate was more than half empty to start with, but I felt completely satisfied afterward. The meat was incredibly tender and seasoned to perfection. Potatoes and veg were full of rich flavour.


BRULÉE ROYALE - \"A rich and flavourful crème brulée\"  

- This is probably the best crème brulée I've had in a long time. The highlight of the meal!

This place isn't about eating \"light\". The food is rich and filling, but the quality is excellent. I'm not sure if I'd pay full price at the Sultan's tent for the show, but it looks like fun (maybe a good place to throw a party).

There was a bit of a wait to place our order but the service was very good after that. The only negative comments I have are regarding the air conditioning and wine: the air was BLASTING the whole time and I was nearly shivering after dinner was over. I don't think they need to keep it so cold.  The waiter admitted that ordering a half-liter of wine for $24 would amount to about 1 and a quarter glass each for two people.  This seems pricey when you consider that one glass was $8.75 - there is no incentive to order larger quantities if you're looking for value, but I guess that must be how they make their profits."}
{"text":"I came here for a bachelorette party. I would give the atmosphere 4 stars but the food 3 stars. The Moroccan tents and belly dancing show was an experience. The belly dancers even came into our tent and taught us some moves. The servers also shared the high pouring to show respect. Our waiter was not great at topping off our water glasses nor was he good at making food suggestions. There was a traditional couscous dessert that her really pushed that most of us didn't like. The rest of the food was okay but I wouldn't come back for the food."}
{"text":"Before visiting The Sultan's Tent and Moroccan Café for the very first time, I'd never had the opportunity to try Moroccan food.  Walking into The Sultan's Tent is little like venturing into Morocco (sans the 8-hour flight and jetlag) with the space designed as one large Pergola tent featuring bright silks, cushions and pillows all throughout. 

Offering a pre-fixe menu each evening (including lamb and seafood, as just some of the options), you are given an exotic take on all things Moroccan.  

But beyond the food, the live show is why you should visit, to be honest. 
Each night around 7 pm, belly dancers make their way to the main stage for a fun-filled evening filled with audience participation. This place is great for parties."}
{"text":"i'm in agreement with fellow yelp reviewer Andrea W.  

Sultan's Tent is a great place for a casual lunch, night out with friends, or for a fun date. 

I've gone during lunch time where the menu is quite affordable.  Their lunch seating is in the front of the restaurant and the decor is quite lovely.  I had the haria soup which was delicious and perfect on that rainy day.  The lamb/beef burger was awesome and I usually don't like lamb very much.   The fries that accompanied the meal had great seasoning and were perfectly cooked.

My husband and I returned for dinner this past wknd.  Just as a heads up, you should RSVP for wknd nites at least a week in advance.  I made reservations on a Monday for the upcoming Saturday night and they only had seatings for 5:30 or 1030pm.  The restaurants takes reservations in groups (530, 8, and 1030pm) so of course all the 8pm spots get taken first.  

Dinner is seated in back of the restaurant and the front of the restaurant becomes the bar area.  The decor was festive and made to look like tents.  However, I do agree that lighting is much too dim at all the tables and the tables are a bit on the small side.  The belly dancers were fun to watch (especially when diners were persuaded to dance with them). . . I have several friends who take classes & perform bellydancing and are more skilled than the girls at the restaurant.  But they make up for this with their enthusiasm, are really friendly,  and try to get guest participation without too much pressure.  

As for the food, I have no complaints.  For our first course, my husband had the duck salad which was fresh and had slices of ripe mango ont he side.  I had the dish of olives.   We both had the Maftoul (morroccan cigars, a spicy beef mixture rolled inside a flaky pastry) for our second course.  For the third (main) course i had the beef ribs (extremely tender meat that fell off the bone) and my husband had the lamb.  And finally for dessert we both had the chocolate souffle which was amazing.  I'm not into super chocolately desserts but it had a perfect balance of richness that everyone can enjoy.

Service was excellent with very attentive staff.  We had to wait slightly longer for our second course to come out and so the manager bought us a round of drinks on the house."}
{"text":"Before the Sultan's Tent my only experience with Moroccan food had been the chicken tagine I cooked for myself.  The night started out pleasantly enough.  My girlfriend and I were seated promptly and I was impressed with the decor and ambiance.  Our server was ok, until he \"accidentally\" overcharged us $30.

We both ordered the harira for our first course.  It was nicely seasoned and actually quite good.  We were both excited for more.
Second course arrived swiftly, bastilla.  This was the dish I was most excited to try.   Chicken and spices wrapped inside of phylo dough, and topped with cinnamon, sugar and almonds.  It sounded and looked spectacular.  After several bites, however, the only thing I could taste was cinnamon.  The filling was an indiscernible mush void of any distinct flavor.  This would be the recurring theme of the night.  I was very disappointed, but held out hope for the third course.

My third course was braised lamb shank and my girlfriend went with Marrakech chicken.  My lamb and couscous were extremely bland.  How you can braise a lamb shank and still have it be totally flavorless is beyond my comprehension.  I tried a bite of her chicken and was overwhelmed with the flavor of, well, chicken.  That was the most concentrated and pronounced chicken flavor I have ever experienced.  Sadly there was not even a hint of anything remotely Moroccan about either of our dishes. 

Dessert was almost comical.  I went with the Moroccan treats, otherwise known as two sad looking cookies and a slice of orange sprinkled with cinnamon.  Her creme brulee tasted nice but did not have the texture and consistency you would expect.  The tea was nice.

The highlight of the night may have been the belly dancer.  Not that I am interested in that sort of thing but because the older men seated behind me made total fools of themselves during the show.  They gawked and shouted at the dancer and acted like they had never seen a woman before.  Pretty funny.  I was impressed at how the servers were able to dodge the dancers during service, but I was secretly hoping for a collision. 

In summary a very disappointing experience.  How you can take a cuisine known for big bright flavors and tons of spices and turn it into bland, tasteless gruel like that is a mystery.  I greatly preferred my own attempt at Moroccan food."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Overly priced food. You can definately get same stuff that tastes much better elsewhere.  Best part was ambiance and entertainment.  Guess rent is expensive in the area"}
{"text":"5/5 stars for the experience! I went here with my family for dinner on a Wag Jag (or something similar to it) and I was delighted by the experience. At first I was a little apprehensive to try the food because it wasn't pasta (LOL), but it was really delicious! I loved everything I tried, it was all so different and interesting. If I saw this deal again, I would definitely go back.
The cushiony couches were neat, the draped room felt so special, and our waitress was excellent. 
I liked watching the belly dancer dance and drunk patrons dance with her. I enjoyed watching our boiling hot tea be poured into our little tea cups from our waiter's outstretched arm. I had a great night with my family here and I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended for the experience of dining and belly dancing but was immediately turned off when halfway though dining a mouse trap triggered between my seat and the booth next to me. 

The food was quite delicious. My husband, his friends, and I ordered Smelt and Hummus to split for an appetizer. The Hummus goes without saying but the Smelt was seasoned to perfection and brought an amazing bite with the spice used!

Moving onto main courses, I choose a Chickpea Stew that was flavorful and plentiful... so plentiful, I couldn't even come close to finishing! But as we sipped cocktails post dinner, the trap below our seats snapped and I was immediately lost in thoughts about where the mouse may be and found myself questioning if there were any in the kitchen. Sorely disappointed but have nothing but great things to say about the food and staff who were more than friendly (and quite funny)!"}
{"text":"About a 3.5 - 4. I was here for summerlicious 2 years ago (Cafe Moroc). It was def. a 4 +. I remember everyone being very kind courteous & the manager even stopped by to speak w/ my group. The food was amazing then so I was really looking forward to coming here as a friend was having a stagette (dinner & show).

We were supposed to be on the main floor but because the air conditioner was down that day we were moved to the basement. I think it was the manager who helped moved us down as we were waiting for at least 15 mins even though reservations had heen made in advance & none of the staff did n e thing about it. The basement was another area w/ nice moroccan decor (although one pal didn't think so lol). It was dimly lit..so my photos were absolute crap.

The show was alright although I thought it was a bit short. The BELLY dancer (please see pic :D) danced around the room for about 5 mins then went around each table. She even got the bride & bm's to dance around a lil.

Dinner was starting at $ 45 up (they should update the website it says $ 39.95 still). There were four courses. I just didn't like how we had to pay a little extra for certain dishes so it restricted me a little but I tried to keep within the regular menu. I ordered the...

Sliced Smoked Duck Breast Salad - I didn't mind paying $ 4 or so extra as the Harira or bowl of olives did not seem as appetizing to me. Some of the girls ordered the olives and said it was a bit salty. 

Hummus & Zaalouk - trio of hummus including traditional black bean & roasted red pepper, roasted eggplant and tomato puree. Fresh cilantro & served with pita. This was very interesting & it was nice trying the various flavours. 

Braised Lamb - slow braised lamb shank, served with tagine seasoned couscous with a rich prune demi glace, topped with preserved lemon and toasted almonds. The meat was so tender it literally slid off the bone as one yelper mentioned. It was delicious! I almost wanted to ask for a box to take the bone home for my dog as it was crazy large lol The third course was definitely filling.

Brulee Royale - I absolutely adore eating crème brulee so I did not mind paying nearly $ 3 extra. It did not disappoint.

Overall, the food was quite good & I would come back again though only for special occasions as I'm a frugal eater. I was still stuffed the next morning & wasn't hungry until noon time!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I can never get myself to love it - but if you're in a large group and need a decent place for a solid pre-fixe menu that also turns into a venue - this is your spot. It's great for birthdays, wedding, parties, staff events, showers, whatever. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. It's a high value establishment - that's for sure. 

+ points for belly dancing and showmanship of coffee pouring."}
{"text":"We were warned that we should not go to this place and this is after we had made reservations two weeks in advance. We were told the food is terrible especially the lamb and the belly dancers are not good either. 
Well our experience was very pleasant, the food was great, from the starter to the main course (yes I opted for lamb and every bit of it was Amazing). Go for the lamb if you are doing the four course meal thing. The dancers put on a great show as well.
I would definitely go back to this pace, just make sure you ask them to be seated in one of the tents and not in the way."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Amazing atmosphere and very clean. Food was good, I would give it 4 starts because it was cold. However the service was terrible and disappointing. Our server changed three times and none of them checked up on us to make sure if we need anything. There was a belly dancer which was kinda neat!"}
{"text":"I am giving Sultan's Tent a 4 more for the belly dancing experience than for the food.  The food is about a 3. 

VIBE 
You really do feel like you're in Morocco here. It's a sexy place with traditional lanterns, private booths for your group (and this is definitely a place to take a group for a bachelorette in our case to start the night) and of course, belly dancing! 

There's a set time limit on your experience here at around 2 hours so the staff can prep for the next seatings, but it works.The belly dancing is amazing and a hoot with everyone. We even saw a proposal here. So cute! So break out the symbols and the scarfs because it's going to be a rocking time! 

One thing: it kind of sucks to eat your main course in the dark but I get it. 

WE ATE 
As in the previous reviews and as your server explain, the meal is a four course prixe fixe at $40. If you want certain items you'll pay extra. Then there's an obligatory tax and tip worked into the price. With a pop and an extra $4 for creme brulee I ended up paying closer to $60. Just a heads up if there are some thrifty sticklers in your group. 
I'm not sure if it's worth the cost as some options in the courses are things like hummus. I did get the hummus and it was delicious but their \"pita\" was not. Make sure to ask for cucumbers. What else did I have? Butternut Squash soup (good); the lamb --not falling off the bone and was OK. The creme brulee had roasted pistachios on top and it was a solid brulee. I recommend it! 

The service was a bit off at first but it got a bit more consistent as the night went on. I can understand it can be overwhelming to prepare for so many groups at once but I figured they'd have the tricks for that down by now.

Other things I saw and will judge: the duck salad -- after seeing it, there's not a lot of duck, so I'd save your money; I had a bite of the Maftoul and it was delicious! 
It's like a Moroccan spring roll.

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
We \"Marcocced\" the casbah! A great place for groups but as others have said, go for the experience, not the food."}
{"text":"A must visit when in Toronto.

4 course dinner accompanied by belly dancers. This is different then most belly dancing I have seen (very dramatic and classy). 

Best atmosphere and food experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is bland! The Ambiance is NICE but the service is awful. All I remembered leaving that place was they could have hired good looking belly dancers to make up for the bland and pricey food!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me to have dinner here while I was visiting Toronto. This place does an amazing job with captivating you with their Moroccan themed decor. Color and tents provide an unique and enjoyable ambience. 

The food however, could have been more authentic. They did such a great job in creating a Moroccan themed atmosphere, which I guess is why I had higher expectations in terms of the cuisine.  

I decided to check out their Salmon dish which came with a sort of purée and mixed bean salad and my friend had the Lamb Shank which he enjoyed. The portions were pretty decent sized. 

Overall, we enjoyed our experience. I'd recommend checking the place out for their great ambience, but if you find something better offering more authentic cuisine, then definitely go for it!!"}
{"text":"Sultan's Tent does a great job of captivating with its decor and whimsy. It seems like you're going somewhere special when you walk in and the service certainly lives up to that high standard. But then again, mood, decor and service can only take you so far. 
I had some excellent dishes as well as some disappointing ones. The bastilla and rack of lamb were absolutely superb. The Moroccan cigars were good enough but not authentic - though I do realize this is meant to be French-inspired Moroccan. Some of the other lamb dishes  I tried were not particularly good.

I would go back again, but recommend to err on the side of the more elaborate (read pricey) dishes. They certainly were good."}
{"text":"We went there for the show and the ambience, besides everything was disappointing. I uploaded the photo by the order they served us. We went there by 19:00. Our first course was the entrée. We were so surprised. Then the show started around 20:30. After the show finished, they came to take our plates. We told different servers serval times about the missing appetizers, but no one really put in mind until the leader told us they forgot our meals after nine. He apologized and offered us a 50% discount the full bill, and gave us 2 free glasses of wine. After that, our missing meals all appeared. However, the final bill was only 15% on entrées, and they charged us additional pita which we didn't order. Well, it was a bad Friday for us. We paid like we had a French dinner but we had some homemade foods in fact."}
{"text":"Go for the experience, not the food. The vibe/ decor gets a 10/10. However, the food and service lacks.The service got worse from the time we were seated by the end of the dinner."}
{"text":"Tried to come here for a late dinner/snacks on a Saturday evening with a few friends.  We arrived an hour or so before the kitchen closed.   We were greeted and seated immediately.  There were only 3 other tables, each with 2 people. All of whom were just having drinks. The bartender, who sat us, told us both he and another server would be taking care of us. We ordered a bottle of wine, which was fine.  This is where things took a turn for the worse.

After our wine was poured, nobody came to our table for over 30 minutes.  One person in our party walked to the bar and asked the bartender if anybody would be coming to take our order. He apologized and said he thought somebody was taking care of us.  From there, you'd think that either he or this alleged other server would immediately come to the table.  That's not the case.  We waited another 10 minutes before the bartender finally came to the table.  All the while, both he and other restaurant staff were chatting.  I could understand if they were busy serving other customers, but there were very few people in the restaurant, all of whom weren't getting service either.

I should have taken the hint by the prix fixe menu's title, \"Morocolicious.\""}
{"text":"I've been to the Sultant's tent a couple of times and I've always felt the service and food were very mediocre. My cousin had her birthday dinner there yesterday and I must say not much has changed since the my last visit in 2014. The service it still very slow, and the food is still mediocre. 

I arrived with my husband 15 minuets earlier than the reservation for 8:30, when I spoke with hostess she advised our table wasn't ready yet and would be ready shortly. At 8:45 it still wasn't ready, we were not seated to our table till 9pm. I understand Saturdays can be busy however it was ridiculous that she kept telling me the table was being cleaned and cutlery was being placed when another party was still sitting at our reserved table. Once we were seated it took another 20 minuets for our server to bring water & drinks. The only \"decent\" thing I ate was the appetizer. The hummus & pita were very tasty (I would've preferred a softer pita but it was still good) my husband had the cuban cigar which was also very tasty, I would highly recommend. I was very disappointed when the dancers came out as there was only two dancers and the belly dancing was just \"ok\". Our meals didn't come till about an hour and a half later. I had the lamb shank (it was very tender but bland) and my husband had the peri peri chicken that was also very bland and had no spice to it at all. My cousin had the rack of lamb, I had a bite and it was delicious. I would recommend the rack of lamb but I believe its an extra $11 on top of the prefixed price which to me isn't worth it. 

This place really needs to work on organization, a better menu and getting the food out a lot quicker. A 3 course meal should be eaten within 15-20 mins apart from each course not 1 hour apart from each course by the time we got dinner it was almost 11pm. It's a fun experience but I wouldn't return unless there were serious improvements."}
{"text":"Really, really disappointing. Soooo not worth your time & money.

My husband and I had purchased the \"Travelzoo\" deal, and since it was the last night to redeem it (we had forgotten about it!), we were seated in Cafe Maroc (which we were told over the phone when I made the reservation) which was fine with us as we assumed we would still (a) have a table and (b) have a dedicated server.

When we arrived, we waited at the front hostess desk which apparently didn't have anyone working at it. There was no sign indicating that no-one was there and plenty of waitresses/bartenders passed us while we were standing there and didn't mention anything. After about 7 minutes or so I noticed that there was another hostess desk with someone at it towards the back of the restaurant - so we went back there and they found our reservations and seated us at a bar table with high stools (despite there being regular tables available). Our waitress (who was tending bar), came over and explained how the Travelzoo voucher worked and the menu and that was just fine. She advised us that the food wasn't spicy, so that if we wanted spice to ask for the hot sauce on the side. We asked for a drink menu and she left.

About 10 minutes later she brought us some water, and we asked again for a drink menu and to place our orders. She left to put the water down and came back about 7 or 8 minutes later to take our order and dropped off a drink menu.

About 20-25 minutes later we received our first course from a random server. Still no drinks and the waitress had not asked for our drink order. We had to go to the bar and ask for our wine.

When we were done our first course, our waitress came back and asked if the food was ok and if we wanted to order a drink - we told her we had placed the order at the bar and she was like \"Great\" and left. The other bartender (a male) came over and gave us our wine later.

The greens salad was \"ok\", but the Harira soup was *amazing* - spicy and flavourful. It was definitely the best thing I ate at the restaurant and the highlight of my meal.

About 20 minutes later we received our second course. The fekkous was completely bland and unseasoned. It was warm, oily vegetables and there was no salt or pepper shakers on our table and no-one was attending to us so we couldn't even ask for any. My husband had the maftoul and that was the highlight of his meal.

Our waitress came by about 10 minutes later and we asked if we could have some hot sauce for the entree - which to her credit she brought back within a few minutes.

Our dishes were cleared and the entree arrived (there was about 30 minutes between courses). I ordered the Chicken Marakesh which was sooo dry and bland - it literally tasted like it had been sitting under a warming light for 15 minutes. I smothered it in hot sauce which made it edible (the hot sauce is delicious by the way!). My husband ordered the Couscous Royale which, again, we smothered in hot sauce. The kebab was very tender but just...bland! I understand having milder spices but just..this was flavourless.

Someone came and cleared our dishes. By this time we just wanted to leave and we joked that it would be another 30 minutes until dessert arrived.

Not a joke apparently!

We received mint tea (good) and an \"aperitif\" (not good) which was really strong and not to our liking (I gagged). If you're going to charge $10 for an after dinner drink (each) please let us have some choice or a non-alcoholic option (I would have taken more tea if that were an option!)

30 minutes later we got our dessert. My husband had the \"Moroccan Treats\" which were 3 cookies sort of schlepped  onto a white plate and were hard and...tasteless (again!) I had the Brulee Royale which was actually quite good but really cold so apparently it had just come out of the fridge. So not sure why it took 30 minutes to get 3 cookies and a refrigerated dessert to our table but hey - we weren't surprised at that point.

And then an automatic 15% gratuity added! (Which, upon rereading the Travelzoo voucher - I realize it says it will be added but still...hard to swallow when you're basically ignored for 2 hours and get cold, bland food)

I understand that we came in on the last day, but it wasn't *that* busy and there were plenty of staff hanging around the bar and chatting so I'm not sure who they were serving but it surely wasn't customers. And maybe the 30 minute wait between courses is something they do on purpose but it just dragged by - especially when we had no water and no drinks and the food tasted like it had been sitting around for hours in a buffet.

You could not pay me to eat here again. Horrible, horrible service and bland, sub-par food. There are so many better restaurants around the Front Street area - do not waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY

Date of visit: 10/10/2012

Ambience: 3/5
Decoration, music and lighting were nice.  My husband and I were seated in the aisle, which made us feel a bit like we were on the stage since it was where the belly dancer came out and danced.  There were a few big groups but the noise was moderate.

Food: 2/5
Maftoul (like spiced beef spring roll) was tasty but way too much chipotle aioli on top, we had to scrape it off before eating. Coconut Shrimp was over fried a bit but still tasted alright. The spicy mango chutney for the shrimp tasted too sweet and not spicy at all. The chipotle aioli actually enhances the coconut shrimp better. My husband had the Steak Frites medium well and he really loved the steak and Moroc Frites. Some of the mussels from my Seafood Royale were sandy and not fresh, I had to spit them out.  That left a bad taste in my mouth, and I got a stomach ache after. The dish was supposed to have scallops and monkfish as well, but I think they were replaced by octopus.  I was quite disappointed because I love scallops.  The portion was generous but there was too much broth. When I asked for it to go, it came back in just a box with no bags.  The broth leaked over my dress on the way home.  

Belly Dance Performance: 1/5
We got to see 5 out of the 30-minute bellydance as the dancer moved around a lot.  Her skill was not amazing and she was too chatty.  She had money bills tucked around her waist, which I found quite inappropriate.
 
Service: 2/5
We were served by two waiters, first one was Chris who fixed my wobbly chair problem and took our order.  He was informative and friendly.  Our second server was not as good, our glasses of water were not refilled, he packed my meal carelessly (as mentioned above), and he tried to overcharge us $5.95 for something we did not order.

Price: 1/5
Very overpriced.  You have to order a four-course dinner starting at $39.95, which does not offer many great choices.  Expect to pay an extra $10 - $20 per person for better options."}
{"text":"Hit The Sultan's Tent last night with 6 other friends for a bit of Moroccan fare. We opted for the $39.95 four-course menu, over their Winterlicious spread....and it was definitely worth every dollar. 

From what I was told, the Winterlicious diners had to be seated at the front of the restaurant, while us four-coursers were escorted to the fancier and more intimate digs at the back -- chiffon drapes, dimmed lighting, and ofcourse, the belly dancing.

Oh and the food!! The Harira was a flavourful soup with a mild, spicy kick, and did not disappoint. This was followed by the delectable 'Moroccan Cigars', which were crunchy and flavourful. For my main, I went with the Braised Lamb (given that mutton and lamb form the base of Moroccan cuisine, it would be wrong to choose otherwise!). The tender, fall-of-the-bone lamb shank served on a bed of tagine seasoned couscous proved to be the true pièce de résistance. Absolutely, absolutely delicious!

We sampled the three different desserts off each other's plates, but the Brulee Royale topped with crushed pistachios was the real crowd pleaser. A shot of hot and minty Moroccan tea made for a perfect end to a fantastic meal.

The server did a great job with recommendations, the staff were really friendly, and the service was quick, with courses coming out before we could clean the crumbs off our shirts. The Middle Eastern decor, with its rich, dark colours and soft lighting, created a beautiful, ambient setting for a cosy, chilled-out dinner with friends.

I'm only taking away one star because, for me, the entertainment fell a little short. Having witnessed my fair share of Middle Eastern belly dancers, what diners at The Sultan's Tent were offered was more contemporary and less shimmy. Even the boys at my table were bored after a while. Don't let that sway your judgement though - she still does put on a show.

Overall - I've been meaning to dine at this restaurant for a while, and our dining experience definitely made it worth the wait."}
{"text":"The last time I visited the Sultan's Tent it was situated in Yorkville, Nirvana's \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" was blasting on everyone's Discman, and this restaurant was seemingly on it's last legs while featuring belly dancers that looked like dead ringers for Courtney Love...not a good scene...

Fast forward 20 years later and I'm here for a Yelp get-together at the nouveau incarnation of The Sultan's Tent, now located at Front Street and y'know what?? I have to say bravo as they've cleaned up pretty nice! The interior is an exotically elegant mash-up of \"Rick's Café Américain'' and Scheherazade's lair if you'll pardon my layman's description, the belly dancers are lookers, and the food is surprisingly very good!

Our group was here for Summerlicious as the menu had a generous variety of three course offerings.  I decided on the Harira, a minestrone-like soup with chick peas, lentils and Kidney beans, the Chicken Marrakesh which featured chicken braised in apricots/prunes and a generous helping of broth infused couscous, which was simply divine and to finish I have the Cinnamon Apple Cheese Cake.  

I have to give props to our lady server who was ON THE BALL!   There were other male servers who seemed to be super confused, and playing musical entrees with our orders, but SHE whipped 'em into shape and had our orders all sorted out.  That's right fellas...Leave it to a woman to get things done right!!!

A big thank-you to Food Blogger extrordinaire Viviana M for orchestrating this amazing UYE.  My taste buds are still reeling from that savoury Chicken Marrakesh and yes I've already devoured my take-home portion on the same night while watching the Colbert Report...it is THAT GOOD!!!

One last note : My experience could have yielded 5 stars, but alas I was a bit crestfallen as one of our male dining counterparts was a little \"too shy\" to get his Shakira moves on.  Ahhh well, I guess his hips don't lie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z-_mzd0lWM&feature=related"}
{"text":"Bad service! Bad food! Bad belly dance! Will never go back and won't recommend anyone to.

Wrote a detailed review before but got removed from the site back then, I suspect they were able to pay to remove it 2 years ago!? 
Now they are promoting they cannot do so, therefore I start writing again. 
What happened was:

Just went there tonight, my whole family have a bad experience with the service provided by our server, namely: that he rushed our table to order three times while we were not ready (we sat down for 5 mins only, I was reading the Art of belly dancing on the menu which was bringing me into the mood, but the server didn't let me enjoy what the restaurant has to offer); that he ignored my question regarding the drink, he listened to my question, didn't say anything and walked away; that he walked away before listening to all I want to say to him, this is rude to a customer (I was trying to tell him to serve the dishes in order because the second dishes were all cramped on our small table while we were still eating our appetizer)! I have this expectation because I walked in a restaurant but not a fast food place.

Agreeing with the other reviewers, the food is between mediocre to bad, disappointing as we expected exotic Morocan tastes. The dessert is a joke, I don't think a failed-making meringue is a treat from Morocan.  The poor service just bring the tasting experience down.  Price is not fair with the quality of food they are providing.

The moves of the belly dancers doesn't look professional, they didn't cover all the tents with the same amount of time, they just go around to whoever have tips to put in their lower abdomin.  It is a restaurant with this show as it's highlight, I expect them to treat all tables equally and make a more professional performance.

I give one star because the decor is nice, some of the glasses are pretty and the original tent sitting concept is great.  Undeniably, when we first walked in, we feel the vibe is great.  The restaurant should run & manage better or there won't be any return customers.

My friend told me not to go but I insist to give it a try because of the concept of the restaurant sounds interesting. Now I know why they don't want to return again. Our group will not go back for sure. Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"A search for a nice entertaining restaurant led me to Sultan's Tent, I was hoping to savor the atmosphere of harem, enjoy some belly dancing and perhaps dive into Moroccan flavors. I imagined that Front street location would mean top bucks but was secretly praying it will be worth it. Oh no it's not. 
The ambiance is alright: silk tents lit by a few lanterns, lots of soft cushions, mint tea poured from up high into tall ornate glass, after a drink or two you believe the illusion of  harem.

The dancing is almost nonexistent. The show is supposed to last 30 minutes. But because there is only one dancer who has to run up and down the hall to dance for every group you only see her up close in spans of 30-40 seconds and then she moves to another tent. The actual dancing lasts about 10 minutes then she runs to each tent and tries to get the ladies to dance with her, while men are completely abandoned by her attention. Is it interesting to watch general public shake their winter assets? I don't think so. So after the first ten minutes of trying to catch a glimpse of the dancer you return to your food and forget about her. That kind of a show is definitely not suited for the guy groups, they will get bored to death and no amount of alcohol will help.

The food is pretty average, you can get same quality for half the price. The only real hit was rack of lamb, they serve you 6 ribs which is a good amount for a man. The couscous was rather sour. We laughed at Moroccan treats which were 2 tiny cookies and 2 orange slices sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, who was so brave as to call it Moroccan?

The bill came to 60pp w/o alcohol.  I did not get the satisfaction from the food nor the show. Overall 1 star for decor, 1 star for rack of lamb and 0.5 stars for the presence of the dancer. Never again."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, amazing food and the belly dancers were so interactive. I came here for my birthday with family and friends and everyone had a good time and enjoyed their food. I had the soup, coconut shrimp and beef ribs. Absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"High marks here for originality and experience.  I was here with a big group, and I honestly don't remember how good the food was.  Which probably isn't saying much about the food.  But they had belly dancers, and a really cool interior decor.  

I was wearing a blazer during dinner and was hot as hell.  So just keep that in mind when you dine here.  Be prepared to want to strip something off to keep cool.  

Overall, had a good time.  Worth checking out for sure.

{"text":"Been here twice, once with family and once on a date. The food is overprice but for a good reason. The staff is very professional and the mint tea is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious and the ambience is the reason I would go there again and again. The annex lounge downstairs is very well decorated and makes you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Everyone--and I mean everyone--told us that we are going to just love the food in Toronto.  We didn't really doubt this because we have had so many unforgettable gastro-experiences in Montreal and since Toronto is also in Canada, how different can it really be?!  We decided to be spontaneous and chose The Sultan's Tent & Cafe Morac--a Moroccan restaurant as our first taste of Toronto.  We didn't know anything about the place but we passed it on the way to our other reservation and decided to just go for it!

Inside, we thought the place looked the part.  It had the appropriate amount of Moroccan ambiance--including belly dancers in the back--the Sultan's Tent.  We opted to sit at the bar in the front of the restaurant--Cafe Maroc--so we could chat it up with the bartenders and hopefully get some other food recommendations from people who would be in the know.

The menu had several of my favorite Moroccan dishes which was promising but isn't that expected in a Moroccan restaurant?   It is difficult to tell where it all went wrong but overall we were not too impressed with the food.  Here is what we ate:


B'Stila  

B'Stila is one of my favorite dishes and unfortunately Cafe Morac didn't get it right.  The chicken was dry and stringy and the the phyllo was doughy.  All I could stomach was just a few bites.


Moroccan Crab Cake

I actually enjoyed this dish but Dr. J didn't think it was that great.  I believe I appreciated the little kick it had or maybe the frog legs gave me New Orleans flashbacks.  Now, I haven't been to Morocco yet so I could be very wrong in thinking this but is frog part of Moroccan cuisine?  I wouldn't even say anything about this if the dish was just called Crab Cakes but since they put the Morocco in the name, I had to ask.


Chicken Marakesh

I didn't spell it wrong, this is the way the restaurant spells Marrakesh.  This was our least favorite dish of them all.  It was the complete opposite of the Moroccan Crab Cake because it was quite bland.


Latshin

Oranges with cinnamon and powdered sugar.  I could have had a bit more powdered sugar and cinnamon--just saying.


Mint Tea

Our favorite part of this meal was the mint tea.  The presentation was well done and the taste was perfect.  I was glad to end the evening on a high note.


I wish I could say our dining experiences improved on this trip but they went downhill from here!  If we had found a genie's lamp hidden somewhere in the Sultan's Tent, our first wish would have been for better food!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Sultan's Tent once, and had some mixed feelings about it, then I decided never to visit again.
Although it has some great potential because it's one of its kind in Toronto, but it's missing that true identity..
I don't personally believe that price fixed menus work  for mediterranean cuisines..where they include alot of essential appetizers to enjoy for example, rather than being limited to 'crushed olives' or 'samosas'

They're very pushy when it comes to reservation, as you and your party are only granted a fixed 2 hrs window, and you'd have to settle the bill and leave before! This is a big thumbs down in the industry, by no means a customer should be forced to leave, rather than being welcomed and enjoy a good meal!
 
The overall atmosphere is beautiful and inviting, but the menu, packages/options, customer service, identity needs to be reconsidered."}
{"text":"My first visit I loved this place. The food was different and I have never tried Moroccian food so wasn't sure what it was gonna taste like. Loved it! Decor here is unreal, it feels like your in Morocco.  Service was great and I loved the belly dancing. I give them 5 stars for being different and thinking outside the box. I will keep this place for special occasions!"}
{"text":"We went here for a quiet evening and it was terrific so a group of us went here for a birthday celebration. They have a fixed price menu with several courses. You can look on their website in advance to see what you would like. I particularly enjoyed the traditional Moroccan Harira soup and the \"cigars\". It was all very enjoyable. The atmosphere with the tenting inside the restaurant is beautiful. We also went to see the belly dancing. That was a fun part and some of us got up to get a \"mini lesson\". It was fun and silly. A great pick me up experience with beautiful surroundings. The service was very good and they checked with us to see that everything was going well."}
{"text":"Had heard so many great things about this place, so had to check it out. I bought a deal for 4 people from travelzoo and was VERY dissappointed to find that the restaurant was charging us additionally for some things that were not part of the voucher. The person who greeted us was rude, asked us what time our reservation was for (knowing that we were 15 mins late). He seated us, and our moderately friendly server took over. He went over the additional charged quickly, without giving us a second to ask questions. He didn't explain the menu properly either. I feel like we were being treated poorly because we were \"voucher customers\". 
Most items on the menu had additional charges.
Overall, very dissappointing experience. Food is way overpriced for the quality and the service."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, Sultan's Tent is only here for gimmicky entertainment and ambience, not for the food.  The bellydancers are entertaining, but they lose their novelty pretty quickly (more amusing are the people dancing stiffly with them. :D)

I came here for a friend's birthday and ordered the following:

Harira: A good and hearty soup.  I like it.  
Maftoul: nice and crispy!  I liked this.  A  tad on the greasy side though.  
Couscous royale: The sausages were undercooked and had a gross texture.  The meat also tasted like it may have gone bad.  Lastly, I've never been a fan of tagine (I should've remembered that before ordering it!)  
Moroccan treats: Dry as heck.  

Dinner came out to about $50 per person.  Note that there are a bunch of \"upgrade/upsell\" options that they try to push on you.  

The only really awesome part of the meal was that for my friend's birthday cake, they brought out a dessert in the shape of a fez.  A-MAZE-ING.  (the tassel was made of chocolate)"}
{"text":"The only saving grace for this restaurant is the BEAUTIFUL atmosphere and the belly dancing show. Otherwise the food portions for the appetizers were tiny for the price ~$10-$15 and mediocre tasting. 

BEWARE: we were told when we got there that it was a $25/person minimum spending and for large groups, an automatic 18% tip is charged. 

THE FOOD:
Vegetable Briwatts - 3 pieces of triangular phyllo wrapped vegetables with a chipotle aioli. Overall tasted ok but the chipotle mayo feels out of place with such a supposedly Moroccan dish. 
Chicken Bastilla - interesting phyllo wrapped shredded chicken surrounded by  sliced almonds, confectioner sugar & cinnamon. Flavours and texture was interestingly good but chicken was dry and portion was pretty small. 
Royal Brochette- $15 for 3 skewers with ~4 small pieces of meat (shrimp, lamb, and chicken) is a rip-off. I must admit I really liked the flavour and cook on the lam skewer, otherwise the shrimp and chicken tasted OK and was drier.

The main courses do look greater in portion, but be prepared to spend $35-$55 to get that. 

THE STAFF & ATMOSPHERE: the servers looked and sounded quite unmotivated, although still polite. The decorations from the tents, pillow seats, lanterns and wall decor transported me elsewhere. The belly dancing show was super fun and the dancer would interact with each table !! The show lasted 30 min at ~8pm on a weeknight."}
{"text":"This place is an event and an experience, the food is ok, but it's really reasonable for what's happy-happening around you. 

I came with 4 girlfriends for a bachelorette party. It was a pretty classic situation: 5 drunk girls walk into a fancy restaurant to eat for the first time in 8 hours and to see belly dancing around 10pm, hilarity and a laugh track ensue. 

We, of course, had the bachelorette (a lady who hates the spotlight, but has a knack for ending up in awkward situations) try out the belly dancing. She was annoyingly good at it. 

We had two bottles of the cava, and some shots. Delightful, and not overly jacked up prices. I was drunk, so I can't remember the exact deets on the drink prices. But, I can remember being pleasantly surprised. 

They have 4 courses for $40. This is a great deal, but if you get one of the \"fancier\" options it does cost extra. I opted for fancy options at every turn. If I return I likely won't jack up my meal, because, well, this place is about the experience, not the food.

I had Beef Bourguignon appy, it was fine. Crab cakes, the star of my dinner. Lamb, nothing to write home about and I finished with oranges and cinnamon*.

Props to our lovely server Jenny for putting up with us. 

PEPPER POINTS: For not being a tourist trap. This place could easily be one, but it really was a pleasant night on the town. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: For making us wait 30 minutes for our table. We were on time for our reservation, and have been setting up and tearing down 

I now understand why a Moroccan tequila shot comes with a cinnamon lick and an orange slice. I love learning drink-related facts."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with smiles greet you upon entering.  Lots of photo ops.  
Nice decor to the theme.  
Basic menu with lots of choices. 
We had traditional  maftoul ( with beef)
A sold choice for apps.  Tried the lobster maftoul.  The tiny bites of lobster found within are a disappointment. 
Orange salad was okay. 
Smoked tomato soup was nice. 
Paella was adequate. 
Leg of lamb was tender (fall of the bone)

What made the night were the friendly dancers.  They interacted thoroughly with the crowd and encouraged pictures.  The family was really happy. 

Servers were attentive, helpful and pleasant.  
Would bring more friends to see the dancers."}
