{"text":"If you want to dine with rats go here. My husband and I are we're there for dinner this week and he saw several rats coming out and trying to get the scraps off the ground. Needs to be reported to Toronto health."}
{"text":"The food was noting special and because it's out doors, there are rats in the restaurant. Yes I said rats, 3 of them, running around grabbing scraps under the tables."}
{"text":"Rats. We saw many of them running across patio. Food wasn't anything special and the hostess comped a lot of our bill when she saw us sitting with our legs up. But nope nope nope nope nope. Fearless rats. Don't do it, it just gets awkward. Gross."}
{"text":"Great interior design to pull you in but once inside disappointment begins. To begin with the service is only ok, a little more enthusiasm would be awesome. Now for the food...we ordered guacamole with tortilla chips, grilled fish tacos, octopus tacos and beef brisket tacos. The Guacamole and salsa were flavorless, the tortilla chips were dripping with oil, the fish taco was served as a huge chunk that was difficult to bite through as it was pan seared so raw inside and has no flavor. The octopus was tough and covered in a supermarket spicy BBQ sauce that was overwhelming and has made my stomach turn, 1 taco was definitely 1 too many and I unfortunately had 2 on my plate! The only decent taco was the beef brisket, a generous supply of beef & nice flavor.   Overall, I regret spending my money & time here especially when I still have an upset stomach 3hrs after eating."}
{"text":"*Great food, good atmosphere, but really poor service. If you are looking for really good tacos and don't care if the service is really bad, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I came here with a close friend because it was super hot out and we thought Mexican food would be perfect in this weather. We had the BEST experience! Tucked behind Playa Hacienda, La Libre is an open air restaurant that was colourful, casual, comfortable and perfect. The food here is inspired by the Yucatan region; they had 2 tacos on their menu but aside from that the menu was predominantly proteins and veggies. All cooked in their wood oven.    We ordered the Guacamole Yuca chips and Tuna Ahumada to start. They were perfect. light and refreshing and perfect. The Yuca chips were a touch greasy but the guacamole was perfectly seasoned. I am a tartar junkie, so I LOVED the Tuna Ahumada. It comes on a crispy chip(?) with avocado and more. For our mains we shared their special Pork Ribs (to die for) and Grilled Octopus (I was in heaven!). Our server was sweet and HILARIOUS, charming and entertaining (Thanks Steven!!!) and pretty on the ball. After dinner, we moved to the bar for a \"night cap\" and was greeted by the most knowledgeable bartender on Mezcal and Tequila I have ever met. We both tried one of their Mezcal and had a tequila as well while learning more than I ever dreamed I would about these two incredible Mexican spirits.   All in all, the food was incredible, drinks were refreshing (The red sangria was amazing, white was good too but go for the red!) service was awesome, and I will definitely be back!"}
