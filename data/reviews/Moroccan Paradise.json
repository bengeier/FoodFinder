{"text":"Great place to eat Moroccan and middle eastern food. Clean and friendly place. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food , great service! The best food Morocian food I have had in America . I am so thankful to find a great place near my apartment"}
{"text":"Visited Moroccan Paradise for a late lunch (2:30pm) and was very impressed! We ordered hummus, chicken tajine, and chicken couscous. Everything was delicious and fresh. The tajine took me back to my time in Morocco, as well as the rotating photos on the TVs. Service was attentive and upbeat. The server was happy to explain the dishes and make recommendations for us. Overall, I highly recommend this place as something different and authentic. The menu features some items that are not Moroccan as well, but I say stick to what they do best!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife just discovered this place recently and decided to give it a try since I am Moroccan. The menu had plenty of good things that I couldn't decide what to get. We finally went with the beef tagine and chicken couscous and it was so good it reminded me of my mom's cooking. I really enjoyed my meal and the rest of my wife's lol and I'm definitely coming back again and again and again. 5 star for sure"}
{"text":"In March, my monthly dinner group of 10 people dined here for the first time and we all were delighted with the menu, food and service. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Good service. The lamb chops, ordered well done, was great. Not chewy or dry, so there's some good skill put into it. The rice was nicely spiced."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant. Amazing food, great service and amazing atmosphere. We went on a group and ordered different dishes and they were all great( this is coming from a Moroccan) the couscous is a must try !"}
{"text":"Been to Morocco, knew I loved the food and hope to find authentic, tasty tajine. Nailed it! Lamb was seasoned perfectly and had a nice level of chargrill, juiciness. Would definitely eat here again if work brings me back to Tempe."}
{"text":"Food was really good and tasty. The service was so professional. The atmosphere is cozy. I'm Moroccan and that's the best Moroccan food I have tried since I came the states. I would recommend lamb Tajine and mix grill( the meat melts in the mouth). Also, you should not miss the zaalook and shakshouka"}
{"text":"Great food  ,great customer  service  ,very friendly   Absolutely healthy food. They have gelato bar . All kabobs are so delicious   I'm so impressed. We will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the lamb chops and beef tajines! That's my favorite and it's actually very tasty!"}
{"text":"The food are great the got the cuscus and tajeens both are amazing. They do it right . The best hummes in Tempe. Im a middle eastern. I know about this stuff."}
{"text":"The best Moroccan food I have had. Period. Amazing customer service, great presentation,  and well prepared. Delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I never had Moroccan food before, but this place was a great first experience for us.  We had the zaaluk, chicken tajine, and beef with prunes tajine, all of which were very good!  The owner and staff were friendly, and considering how large of a group we were with (around 20), the waitstaff did an amazing job accommodating us.  Definitely coming back, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool restaurant, Solid food. Its usually very empty though, the 3-4 times I've been there. The menu is way too big in my opinion and they almost isolate you from the crepe station, but none the less its a new location. Very friendly owner, really friendly and nice staff who are willing to answer questions. These guys really make you feel good about being there."}
{"text":"Moroccan paradise is an Oasis amongst the local restaurants in the Tempe area. I do not claim to be a specialist in Moroccan Cuisine. However, I can tell you that that this little Gem delivers on some of the key components that make a restaurant great Ascetics, Service, quality and value.  I love the ambiance that is presented by this establishment. It feels like I'm in the city. The Colored lights shine down on the multicolor brick and dry wall on to the wooden tables and black furniture. The nearby construction and passing light rail do well to add to the Urban feel.    Televisions are mounted on the wall displaying images of the foods, which I always appreciate as a customer so I know what I am ordering looks like.  I experienced amazing service at this establishment. The waitress Prada was attentive and made my dining an enjoyable experience. She was bubbly and wasn't afraid engage me in conversation. She was on top of her game with my refills and brought out my food promptly.   The salad was crisp glaze over with a light dressing over with a light dressing the crunchy cucumbers The chicken kabobs were grilled to perfection the poultry effortlessly slides off the kabob into your mouth bringing upon a swirl of flavors. Unlike other Chicken kabobs I have tried the herbal seasoning is not overwhelming and perfectly complements the chicken kabob. The sample of Kafka and beef I sampled was prepared in the same manner and exhibited the same qualities. The potato wedges were addicting. No joke. I have never tried better wedges in my life. The restaurant puts some sort of special seasoning on it that made me want to keep stuffing them into my mouth.  For desert I had was a crepe called The Juliet. This was no Ihop crepe. It was served with premium chocolate gelato with internal layers of warm hazelnut chocolate and then topped with chocolate syrup. A fat kid's dream.   Value-wise Moroccan Paradise is hard to beat. All of the items are priced lower at least a couple dollars less than their competitors. The restaurant is also a firm believer in giving customers generous coupons.  Below is a coupon you receive after making your first purchase."}
{"text":"I tried the lemon chicken tajin it was good, big and taste good. It comes with three sides which were delicious. For desert, we had Nutela crepe with two scope of ice cream really good but it's big it's for two persons.  The service was good as well. I gave it 4 stars because I don't give five at all."}
{"text":"Really great food! I never had Moroccan food before, so didn't know what to expect. It was so great though! I'm hoping to come back for a morning crape bar."}
{"text":"Best food at Tempe , I like them food. I think this taste pretty good I have never had . Specially the lamb shops"}
{"text":"Beef Prune Tajine had a delightfully flavored sauce. It was a great place for lunch on a Sunday. The Beef Kabobs were also very tasty. Ample servings, friendly service. The crepe was large, with a pleasing texture, but the gelato was hard rather than soft."}
{"text":"The lamb chops were phenomenal. Cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The rice was tasty and the salad that came with it was unique and refreshing. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and wonderful. My only complaint was the bartending. The good: very, very strong drinks for a reasonable price. The not so good: the waitress's understanding of drinks wasn't excellent but they were deferential to me so I could ensure the drink was exactly what I wanted. Ultimately, I loved this place and they let me decide what I wanted to drink and hooked it up on alcohol content. The food was cheap and the flavor was great."}
{"text":"I tried this place out with a large group this weekend and it was great!  I'm not the most adventurous eater, so I went with something more familiar - chicken kabobs.  They were very good.  My husband tried the lamb tajine and he said it was on par with some of the best steaks he has ever had.  I tried a bite and I agree - very flavorful and tender!  A nice surprise was the crepe/waffle/gelato bar.  I was too full for a crepe but I finished my meal with a scoop of peanut butter gelato!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Definitely coming back. Chicken tajine was delicious. Service was fast. Very clean and comfortable. Good prices as well."}
{"text":"Food has no flavor , the lamb was not cooked well , when I got here I check yalp but it's not real , will never back agin"}
{"text":"Excellent Moroccan food, especially enjoyed the beef tagine."}
{"text":"I brought my whole family and in laws because I thought this place had a Decent halal hamburger .  When I first entered I thought I had the wrong restaurant -- the gelato bar had been replaced with alcohol . It looked like a bar more than a family friendly restaurant . The philly cheese steak is just meat with white Bread and served with cheese half melted. The tangine chicken is bland . The hamburger and fries I ordered was first served as hamburger and then after I finished the burger I received the fries. Everything here is bad. I am never returning and suggest you to go to a place like Phoenicia where food is always great halal and very family friendly. Put this one on the black list. Banned. How do you give zero stars ?"}
{"text":"Driven by this place many times and wanted to check it out. Stopped in with my little Asian lotus one night and we will definitely be coming back. The service was attentive. We each had the mix meat plate. Her's was medium rare, and it was cooked as requested. With a punch card program that gives you a free plate after six, I see return visits in our future."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! If I could mark this as a negative star, I would give a -2.  On a brisk night on Christmas eve's Eve, I arrived to meet my friend for a early Christmas meal. We sat down and looked over the menus in high spirits. Fifteen minutes later and still no orders be be taken. Twenty five minutes now and we were finally able to flag her down. To make clear, she saw us and got water but it look her thirty minutes to take the order. She only brought him water , didn't ask if I would like any.  We both order , mine being the chicken couscous with extra carmalized onion and his being kefta Kebobs, and sat to wait. Quite a while  passes and finely the  food arrives, but it's only my friends. Being one of my oldest friends, he lets me nibble on his food as  me wait first ten, then twenty minutes. Finely my plate arrives. It's the wrong dish. It is some other chicken dish. I tell her the error, that no , I did not want that and I did want the chicken couscous. She takes it back and comes back a few minutes later. She took the original dish and stuffed some couscous under it. To be clear, chicken couscous is very different. In both taste, as it is sweet and in how it's made sense the chicken is suppose to fall off the done and be tender. Thus chicken was savory and not to my taste. Trying to make peace I tried eating it anyways, but  genuinely thought it disgusting. I  then called her back, and asked to reconfirm that she took the last incorrect dish and simply put it on couscous. She confirmed this,  and offered to remake the dish again. By this time my friend had already finished his dish. Although very dry. I told her that I really wasn't interested since he had finished his meal and waiting and she convinced me that it would only take 10 minutes; since she would help recook it with the kitchen staff. 20 minutes later, the food comes out and we are getting up for the table because we are tired of waiting. I then asked for a to go box,  because what am I supposed to do with all this food when we're leaving? She goes and gets the box and comes back with my extra onions but instead of being caramelized onions, they were still raw.  Another 20 minutes later, the food comes out , as we are heading out to pay , and since we are tired of waiting. I didn't asked for a box because what am I supposed to do with all this food when we're leaving. She goes to get the box and comes back with my extra onions but instead of being caramelized onions, they are  sautéed. For anyone that knows the difference, caramelized onions are sweet and will go with a sweet chicken dish wow sautéed onions still have that sharp uncooked onion taste .  I tell her that those are the wrong onions because I ordered extra onions on the chicken couscous and she looked at me confused. This waitress clearly did not know the food. She calls over the owner of the restaurant and I start to explain what happened and he very Condescendingly reiterated the story making it sound like it was my fault when it was clearly the waitress you would gotten it wrong and try to cover up her mistake. At this point I am so frustrated and done with the situation that I just get up to pay. I was then grossly overcharged with any other restaurant after having so much trouble and so much frustration would have Compensated the meal.  $20 for food I didn't even trust to not have been spat in the end from their attitude and  behavior .  Do not eat here! !!!!! This was one of the worst experiences I've had in a very very long time and one enormous pit of regret. Don't make the same mistake , save your money , and don't waste your time. I certainly won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment! I loved the menu options and every aspect of my meal. Only thing I was disappointed by is that their espresso machine was broken and I couldn't order one of the items I wanted, but they had substitutions available that were just as good."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new restaurant for dinner and am absolutely thrilled we chose this spot. You immediately feel immersed in a new culture as you walk through the front door and are greeted with amazing colors and wonderful scents. The menu offers a variety of options from chicken to falafel.   My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken combo plate and the kebabs - both amazing as soon as they were set on our table. The chicken itself was perfectly seasoned, moist, and delicious. The serving size is amazing for the price - overall great menu! We decided to get a dessert drink which truly won me over. The Ilha Bella tastes like a banana split with a coffee whipped cream - two of my favorites.  Truly hope this place gains more of a following so we can continue coming back!"}
{"text":"WHAT IS GOOD:  Go for it! The ambience is very casual with a strange selection of neon lights that make it feel a little bit of a strip club but, GREAT food! Quality and quantity meets for an average medium price that is totally worth it! Service was kind and efficient. mediterranean Halal and Moroccan dishes from the many kebab spiced meat on skewers to the classics like Cous Cous. And surprise...a great list of crepes to end with!  It serves food till very LATE all week. Good just for drinks too !  It gets very busy on saturday when it becomes a dance club.  Easy to find with parking space.   WHAT IS BAD: Nothing to mention. Maybe better lights to create a better atmosphere?"}
{"text":"Not  your  average  burger  joint. Looking for  something  fresh and new then this is the  place  for you.  The ambiance pulls you in. The food is  delicious and the  crepes /desserts  are awesome. Everything is  made fresh to  your  liking."}
{"text":"Ordered a falafel plate, hummus, and heart attack milkshake. Everything was amazing! The service from the young man that served us was very attentive and kind. I enjoy coming here and would recommend it to any friend for any time of the day. The place is warm and inviting. I enjoy the sheesha area, it's very nicely set up."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so amazing! I do not usually write reviews on yelp but I would definitely tell everyone to come and dine in. The food is the most authentic Moroccan food you can have! I spoke with the owner and he told me about the background of this restaurant that opened a month ago and the Tajine plates along with many other items in the restaurant are shipped from Morocco, the chef's are from Morocco as well!  You can not go in without trying either one of the Tajine plates (the lamb one is fantastic!) or one of the grilled platters (mixed grill is my favorite!) They also have a HUGE gelto bar with so may different types of flavors as long as crepes so save some room for those at the end!   The waitresses are always so welcoming and nice and will answer any questions you have about the food. The owner will personally come out and sit with you to chat and see how you liked the food and make sure your visit was pleasant. You will defiantly feel taken care of!"}
{"text":"Overall, just okay -- nothing special but not terrible either. My husband and I had been wanting to try Moroccan Paradise as we had seen it while dining at other restaurants in the area. His parents were wanting to try something different so we went on Friday night for dinner. The restaurant wasn't too busy but after talking to our server, he said business was slower so he was actually the only one taking care of all the tables. The service wasn't too prompt but it wasn't an issue.  We started off with a couple of the smoothie drinks, I was not impressed with my choice. I can't remember what it was called but it had avocado, mango, and a third flavor. My dinner was just okay also. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma which came with rice, potato wedges, and a side salad. I thought the seasonings on the chicken were a little bit weird, not like typical Chicken Shawarma. This restaurant had a different version which I can appreciate but it was a bit bland. My husband ordered the Vegetarian Platter, my mother-in-law got the Beef w/Prunes Tajine, and my father-in-law got the Lamb Couscous.  The Beef w/Prunes Tajine was unique with a sweeter flavor, I tried a bite and thought it was pretty tasty. This dish seemed to be their signature item and was probably the best one out of all of the dishes we had at the table. My father-in-law liked the Lamb Couscous and my husband enjoyed his Vegetarian Platter as well. I tasted all the items from the platter and liked the eggplant the best due to the flavor, all others were mediocre, lacked flavor.  All-in-all, as previously mentioned, our experience was just okay. The prices were a bit high for the quality of the food. The flavors of some of the items were better than others, so I'm still undecided if I will return or not."}
{"text":"I put in a decently sized l order via Postmates ($50ish) and they were out of the Beef w/ Prunes Tajine. Ok, it happens. So I swapped it for the Lamb with Vegetables Cous Cous. They were out of cous cous (a Moroccan restaurant out of cous cous...!). Mmmkay.... here's the kicker though, while I was looking for yet another item to select from their menu, THEY canceled my order because they didn't even have milk for my milkshake. I can't quite wrap my mind around it. Luckily there are plenty of other similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious couscous and lamb kabobs! And they have gelato! Owner is from Morocco so the food is authentic. It's beautifully decorated inside with a nice patio and full bar area. Loved the whole experience."}
{"text":"Went here based of off few reviews that I read on Yelp. First service was tremendously slow, it seemed they were short staff but restaurant was completely empty! Secondly, the food contrary to what previous reviews said was some of the worst food I ever had. My cous cous and chicken was completely bland and had no flavor to it. My husbands kefta kabob was dry and not flavorful at all. I think the earlier reviews may have been given by owners or employees of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We all order the mixed grill. The flavor is good but damn, meat is so charred it's almost inedible. Over all the best part of the meal was the French fries"}
{"text":"Great service and food loved it! Prices aren't bad I'm sure the public will enjoy this place"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much and it's a good thing because the service was terrible.  Waters were never refilled, the waiter checked in with us once and we waited at least 25 minutes for the waiter to take our desert order (finally got tired of waiting so we paid our bill and left without desert).  The only thing the place had going for them is the food was a 7 out of 10.  Service 2 out of 10."}
{"text":"Last Saturday my Hubby and I tried a new place for dinner after we cashed in our free restaurants.com certificate. Here is a review of our experience. Ordered: Hummus - 5/5 Hummus was smooth and full of flavor. The pita was warm and slightly crispy but not hard to chew. $3 Cucumber salad - 5/5 has great spice blend. $3 each Mixed grill - 8/5 The flavor and spices were top notch. Plate is large and very filling. $12 each Mango juice - 5/5 sweet and nicely chilled in a mug. $4 each Desert was a gelato milkshake. On the left is the Havana and on the right is the Ilha Bella. $6 each Clean and friendly staff & owner. You are taken to Morocco with the wonderful smell of spice in the air as you walk in. A/C was at a comfortable level. Overall Experience 5/5 Would recommend to a friend & will return to try their tagines!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Love the tagine. Have been here couple of times and have not been disappointed. Veteran restauranteurs from Montreal of Moroccan decent have made this a must for anyone in search of authentic Moroccan fare."}
{"text":"It was my second and Disappointing visit. Ordered cheese burgers and mix grill platter. Food was below average. Beef was so thin and dry in cheese burger that you need to take a sip of drink in every bite. And mix grill was tasteless with no spices of any kind. Not coming back..."}
{"text":"Microwave food is not nice. I was disappointed how the Moroccan couscous doesn't taste anything like food. My chicken was stiff and and hard to chew on. It felt like plastic. Highly disappointed"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  How about let's start with how it took over an hour and a half to get half the tables food out  Mind you, we are a party of 5 The service is terrible. We sitting here with empty glasses and nothing to even snack on to keep us going, I mean at that time, we didn't know when our food was to arrive. I would never come back to this place, highly recommend going next door where the service is actually 10 times better.   Take my advice on this, and stay away"}
{"text":"It's sad to see that this place is so empty, day and night. Their food is so exquisite and delicious, and the atmosphere is calming during the day and fun with color at night! If you have not been, I definitely recommend checking it out! I came here during my lunch hour twice, had their lamb chops and mint tea, and it was perfect."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great. Very friendly and upbeat place can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Service was great here! The only issue I had was they ran out of soap in the bathroom which was easily corrected! I order my meal... Mixed Grill and promptly this masterpiece of a dish comes out. It has chicken, beef, salad,rice, fresh fries, and naan! It was Amazing! I also ordered a dessert called Inauga.... WOW!!! No words. It is a strawberry lovers delight! This place is by far my new local Mediterranean spot. Also, the biggest plus for me is, due to the large open window I didn't leave smelling like the food I just consumed! This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great here! I recently returned from a trip to Morocco so this amazing food brought back some nice memories! I highly recommend Moroccan paradise"}
{"text":"This is authentic as I know it. I loved the environment that was offered with such hospitality! We had a great time eating here. Try the Kefta Kabob Sandwich and the soup!"}
{"text":"I have a few places in the Tempe area that are my \"go-to\" food spots- this place has definitely been added to the list. Wonderful, heaping portions of food, amazing dessert, and a great relaxing atmosphere. The falafel here is the best I've had, the kebabs and tajine dishes are full of flavor...and to top it off, their gelato milkshakes are insanely good!  Staff is friendly, but the owner, Nabil, is what really makes the place special. He is a wonderful guy, a pleasure to talk to and do business with. If you want something unique and delicious...Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Every other year my wife needs to take a massage class to renew her license so we end up meeting her for lunch 2 to 3 days that week. We usually hit tasty kabob for one of the days and haji baba for another. This time we decided to try Moroccan Paradise for our third day. The food was excellent and the service friendly. Also the interior layout has a good ambiance. If you are looking for good Mediterranean food you should check it out."}
{"text":"I had my GF in there and even if she not familiar with that type of food she loved it. We had a great time. The service was awsome even if the place was packed."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  Service was good and friendly; prices are fair; and serving sizes are good.  We had the hummus and that was good, but the falafel were more like mini cornbread muffins.  It was OK, but I have had better.  Chicken shawarma was OK and the lamb tajine was OK too.  But I guess my biggest criticism is that the seasoning level is rather weak -- my guess is that they cook and season their food for the \"western palate\" and therefore the spice level is rather low."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, affordable prices, generous portions. Also they have a really excellent avocado desert drink. It's not overly sweet but just right with hints of pistachio."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a very large group. We called ahead to let them know - and they took amazing care of us! I had one of their sampler platters - and it was wonderful, extremely flavorful and delicious! Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had the zaaluk, the pompano, and beef tajine, and they were all delicious. If we lived closer, we'd come all the time!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place. The location is good, the place is nicely decorated from the outside and the inside. Their food is really good too, we had the Chicken Tajine and the Kabab platter, and both were really good choices. The food comes in good quantities, and the owner is a true gentleman."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful!  People need to understand that Moroccan food is prepared differently (amazing) than typical \"middle eastern\" food that people in Arizona are used to.  Very kind service and the owner took time to talk to me and was very nice.  They just got a full bar and remodeled and will be having belly dancing on certain nights.  Very cool atmosphere, kind service, excellent food, and neat events...I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was the proverbial Sunday evening, where my wife and I are struggling with dinner selection.  We just had a wonderful Saturday dining experience that was going to be hard to top, and we just wanted something basic.  In my quick search for ideas, I saw a Yelper's review of Moroccan Paradise that had an appealing picture of some type of fish platter. That piqued my interest, problem solved, and onward we went.  We were greeted by a server who was new at her position - this was her second day at her job. She still didn't know the menu very well, but she was helpful and pleasant.   After taking our drink orders, I proceeded with my request for the fish dish that I saw in the picture.   However, I noted that there was no reference to this on the menu, whatsoever. She went to ask the manager regarding my request, and she eventually came back stating that it is simply called a \"fish platter\" but it is not on the menu.  Well then, splendid! I will take the \"fish platter\" that is not on the menu because it is why we came here in the first place.   My wife ordered the Moroccan Beef Couscous. I also ordered a cucumber salad for good measure, and my wife ordered a special banana and strawberry drink.  When the drink arrived, and my wife sampled it, she was quite impressed.   The gentleman that concocted the drink slowly wandered our way, and eventually mustered the courage to inquire as to what we thought of his creation. One word - Marvelous!   He was so happy with our response, and he proudly opined that he made it! Much kudos to him.  The cucumber salad arrived, and it was surprisingly bland. Not quite what I was expecting. So, I took a sample of it, and set it aside as it was not what I had expected.  However, once our dishes arrived, that was another story.  The \"fish platter\" was a grilled Golden Pompano, and quite delicious. It was nearly perfect in every way. However, I will caution you that this fish is \"bone-in\" and these bones are large and sharp enough to cause you pain if you don't extricate them fully from the fish meat.  My wife had the Moroccan Beef Couscous, and it was also quite delightful.   After our meal, we opted for the Nutella Crepe, accompanied by Gelato ice cream. It's presentation was just wonderful as you can see in the pictures, and it tasted even better.  Throughout our dining experience, we were well taken care of, by no less than 3 people. And one of those people happened to be the manager. He politely inquired as to our satisfaction with our food, and we responded by stating that we were very pleased with all that has been served to us.  We truly were very impressed with the flavors and the quality of the food preparation.   Along with the excellent service, this place definitely made a positive and wonderful impression on us!"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place on a Saturday around 12:30 and it was empty not sure why as the food was excellent. I have never eaten Moroccan food but I do eat middle eastern food all the time and although they are different they do carry some similarities. I had the chicken tagine and is was very flavorful and moist. The amount of food for the buck was also great. Also don't miss the desert menu with all of the crepes and drinks. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Hi I recently visited the Moroccan paradise prada was my server she was amazing  best smile ever the food was great the atmosphere was beautiful and upbeat my heart attack smoothie was to die for I recommend this place for everyone to try I know you'll love it I'm defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"Let me just get this straight. I take my patience when I order food especially when I look into the menu. Let's talk first about the time, so I entered at 11:36pm knowing that it closes at 12am. And they were very kind to have us in. All of the gang went in and sat and I asked for the restroom. I went and came back, there was no menu in front of my chair, and he forgot to take my order. I asked him that he forgot and the waiter did say sorry and I accepted it because it's normal and I'm not going to do a fuss. However, after getting the orders and punching them in, he forgot to punch in my order even though I ordered 2 orders \" lamb chops and beef couscous \". The only thing that came to my front \"after everyone got his order\" was the couscous. And I asked him about the lamb chops, but it was already after it closed. The served was nice but he forgot my order. So 4 things happens. 1) he forgot to place the menu. 2) he forgot to take my order. 3) he forgot to punch in my order. 4) he forgot to bring lamb chops which I ordered. He \"assumed\" I only asked for the couscous. Now let's come for the food, I doubt that they have tried the food before it goes out of the kitchen, it was bland. The couscous had no flavor, and the sauce that comes with it had no salt whatsoever. The beef was hard and rubbery. I'm just upset that I didn't enjoy my food and had issues receiving my food without asking the waiter more than once. But def, not coming back. Thank you."}
{"text":"When you see \"Morrocan Paradise\" sign, walk/run away! The food is absolutely tasteless and horrible. This restaurant is overrated. It claims to serve authentic Morrocan cuisine, but it's not.   As we were seated, the table didn't have any silverware, plates, or even ketchup. In fact, silverware came after the appetizers.  We basically ordered Beef Samosas, Chicken Shawarma, mix grill. For drinks, we ordered two smoothies called \"heart attack\". As for the beef Samosas, they were just an oily-tasteless-wrapped-pastry-beef with no spices. The Chicken Shawarma came at first without French fries and it seems it was smothered with tonnes of curry powder. The mixed grill was the worst of all. The beef was like a rubber and overcooked even though we asked for \"medium well done\".The only semi-positive thing about this place is the smoothies. They were not bad. They are just ice cream with mango smoothies.   I honestly regret visiting this restaurant and I believe it is a disgrace for Morrocan food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The mixed grill and chicken kebab sandwich are two of my personal favorites. There are also so many dessert options, the Costa del sol crepe and gelato are so delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant a number of times over the past few months. I love their food. It's delicious and affordable. Their meals are authentic and true to Moroccan dishes. I also enjoy their gelato bar. The pistachio gelato has actual pistachios in it!! Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here after a movie because they are open late.  Most places were already closed!  Reviews look pretty good, and I love authentic ethnic food.  It's easy to miss this place.  You could drive right by it.  The decore inside is modest.  They tried to do something, but it wasn't really immersive in any way.  The music was not Moroccan, but instead was American pop.  I wish places like this wouldn't do that.  It sorta ruins the feel when eating Moroccan food while listening to American pop.  The most interesting thing might be the TV that cycles through photos of Morocco.  Some of those photos made me want to visit there.  We ordered the mixed grill, the beef tajine, and the harrera soup.  The mixed grill is just skewers of the different meats they offer.  The beef tajine is sort of a soup.  That or the sauce is really really thin!  And the harrera soup is, of course, a soup.  The tajine and mixed grill were both served with a seasoned rice.  All items were good.  Nice seasoning, well-prepared.  The soup was really good.  I didn't think much of the wedges of bread (pita?  naan?) that came with it.  They were not warm and soft, and tasted store-bought to me.  After the first try I ignored those and just ate the soup alone.    The mixed grill was not fancy, but flavorful.  The tajine had a lot of fat in the broth.  If you got a spoonful you could see the layer of oil on top of the darker broth.  That's not necessarily bad, but that is what I observed.  The flavor was actually very nice.  Service was good.  Friendly folks.  I could see returning here sometime."}
{"text":"The man taking orders and delivering orders at this restaurant is the absolute worst. I go in for a chicken shhwarma, that's all, ask how long it'll take, he says 10 minutes. 40 minutes later he comes up to me and asks \"are you here for a pick up?\" Somethin was definitely wrong with the guy, whether it be stress or substance abuse, and this was all while there were 2 sets of people eating in the restaurant. Others waiting for food who had ordered before me left because of the wait they had. I hope this review will have some effect on the people who manage this restaurant."}
{"text":"This establishment has a great look, very comfortable and extremely inviting, the decor is really nice large open space. I ordered the larger portion of the Lamb Chops which was a fantastic price, I  received 5 chops and unfortunately only one was seasoned  the other chops was not seasoned at at all and was very bland.  I was disappointed that all five was very oily  (Grilled ?) the sides was average. I will return and I would  recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Our daughter praised this restaurant many times, so we wanted to try it out.  Last night was our unplanned chance. Since we heard so much about it, I was a bit concerned that I might have unreasonably high expectations. Our experience was generally positive.   The decor of this restaurant is simple. Tables have numbers, with a lamp in Moroccan shade (my assumption) and a condiment box. On the wall are flat screens showing beautiful pictures of Morocco. These pictures truly give a sense of this beautiful North African country. They make me want to visit.  The Zaaluk was somewhat of a letdown, even though it tasted freshly made. My experience with Mediterranean cuisine is very positive. I had Baba Ganoush at a restaurant in the middle of Colorado was very good. Consequently, I was so looking forward to this new appetizer. It lacked flavor. Even with the addition of seasonings, it was still bland. But more food was coming.   The grilled pompano platter was very good. The fish was seasoned and grilled to perfection. Like many cuisines outside of North America, this fish was not de-boned.  Neither my wife or I had problem with removing the fish bones, especially when the fish tasted so good. The side salad with its simple oil & vinegar dressing was fresh and tasty.  The lamb vegetable tagine was very tasty. The lamb was very well seasoned and grilled to order (medium rare for my wife).  This savory dish was beautifully presented in the traditional earthen wear with a conical cover.  The owner and waiter were very attentive, with many visits, yet failed to notice our glasses of water needed to be refillEd.  Yes, we should requested water refills but how hard was it to insure proper refill of water. Our glasses were right out front of our table. Also, the waiter took our order for 2 scoops of gelato, and simply forgot. Servicing other customers distracted him.   When it was time to leave, we were requested to go to the counter near the door and to give our table number. The owner presented what we ordered on a tablet. Payment by credit card included an option for tips.  In spite of some shortcomings, the friendliness of the owner and waiter, and the delicious cuisine earn a recommendation from us.  We will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious . I can't even express how good the food is. We've only done take out so I can't comment on the Customer Service but if it's half as good as the food they must rock"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I loved this place. Stopped in after leaving the Aloha Festival and we didn't want to stand in a long line in the sun for Hawaiian food. I love any sort of Middle Eastern or Mediterranean food so we thought we'd give Moroccan Paradise a shot. We started with the hummus and a Ihla Bella (coffee, hazelnut, chocolate, and banana milkshake). Yummy. The hummus was so  fresh you could tell it was made in house. It was smooth and creamy and not cold and generic like other places. Then we ordered the Chicken Shawarma combo to share. It was a great portion and the fries were hot. The Shawarma actually had pickle in it which makes it a Shawarma but some places don't add that to the sandwich. It came with the garlic paste on the side and it was really good also. We finished up with the Montego Bay. A crepe with nutella, banana, chocolate syrup, with a side of chocolate gelato and whipped cream. Man oh man. You will enjoy that. All of this for less than $30 makes it so much more worth it. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I liked it. They are open late, until 1am. I Loved the lamb tagine, the meat was grilled, and  almost tasted like rack of lamb. The owner was super nice, he helped me pick a gelato."}
{"text":"The manager is a very friendly gentleman who spent some time speaking of Fes and how he arrived in Tempe.  Having been to Morroco we enjoyed the conversation.  The food was excellent. I had the Chicken Tangine and had more then enough of very tasty food.   Very much enjoyed our experience"}
{"text":"This place is AH-Mazing! Had falafel and chicken kebabs.. no words! Its SO GOOD! And there is entertainment Fri and Saturday nights! I WILL be back"}
{"text":"Nice n decent place for foodies to go. Dropping one star because of over priced food items. Elaborated menu, but sometimes they can't handle the takeouts. But they manage to take responsibility and compensate next time though. Love their mixed grill platter and sandwiches. Nice n cozy ambiance.  Staff is very friendly and helpful. A great place for the ASU students."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, I got the steak and cheese sandwich for 4.99. It was a 10 inch DELICIOUS steak and cheese with sautéed onion and green peppers. Any other restaurant would charge double the price easy. Also had hummus with a side of cucumber and pita, with a drink all for 9.50 after tax.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was the first time experiencing Moroccan food. I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich combo.  The price was good and it was pretty tasty.  My husband ordered the Beef with Prunes Tagine which I tried.  I will admit the beef was extremely tender and the sauce it was in was pretty good.  For an appetizer we got the poutine and that was another first.  Not to bad.  Overall, I am a pretty basic eater so this was stepping out for me.  And not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Beef dish stringy, tough, inedible. Replaced with chicken dish, no potatoes as on menu. Think they overcharged me as well."}
{"text":"The best Moroccan food I've ever had in my life. My fiancé ordered the prune and beef tagine and I ordered the lamb couscous and it was amazing! The Moroccan mint tea was amazing. I had the bora bora cocktail smoothie that has avocado, strawberry, mango and whip creme on top and it was the best drink I've ever had. I had zalook which is an eggplant and tomato purée you eat with bread. The food and service were top notch and amazing. I will go there a few times a month it is not my favorite."}
{"text":"The place is HUGE!  Super friendly staff and took the time to explain items to us.  I ordered:  Juice:  strawberry and kiwi - It was filling on it's own (fresh blended fruits, you can taste them) Chicken Shawarma sandwich:  Tasty but it was the gyro was dry and hard.  Comes with french fries and a drink.  I got the mint hot tea (YUM). Juliet crepe:  chocolate and hazelnut - crepe was good but chewy.  The gelato ice cream was so so so GOOD.  Not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Not sure how my experience was so different from the majority of the other reviewers. I got the mixed grill and the beef kabob was literally burnt. The kefta was way over cooked. The chicken was really tough and dry. The rice was cold, over cooked, and had no flavor. The service wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Nice selection of Moroccan specialties and Middle Eastern favorites. Staff extremely welcoming and friendly. Look forward to trying more of the Tagines. Portions are generous but not excessive. Many healthy choices - however if you do want to indulge there's also an excellent selection of gelato and specialty desserts. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now - Once in February and once in March of this year (2017). Although this place was not busy on either occasion, the service was great, and the food was excellent. We enjoy the flavors for a change, and have not been disappointed. We will certainly be back again to try some other options from the menu.  Well Done Folks.."}
{"text":"I've only had the kabobs here and i have to say the meat is marinated PERFECTLY!!! However, the rice is not very good at all and is quite dry."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise, morrocan may be my new favorite cuisine. The simple cucumber salad and hummus with beef were both fresh and a great pair. The beef was seasoned beautifully and super tender. The real WOW dishes here are the beautiful aromatic tajine pots. The chicken was super moist and tender, and the thick bread is the perfect vehicle to mop up the rich, salty broth. The savory and slightly sweet beef tajine was fall apart tender and the stewed apricots are to die for. I also reccomend the mixed grill as everything was tender and seasoned beautifully, more flavorful than your normal kabobs imo.  I will be back at some point to try poutine and one of their delectable deserts. Their gelato and crepe creations look like they are to die for.  This place is absolutely going in my heavy rotation."}
{"text":"I'm in town for the marathon, so have no sense of the restaurant scene here.  But this place is really good. First, people are killer nice.  Manager gave me a friendly greeting, and checked often on how things were. Second, juice was really fresh, great start to the night. Main course of the veggie combination was terrific.  And the crepes for dessert were the best of all.   Great place, better than it has to be."}
{"text":"I came to this place as part of a party bus event. Amazing!! The food is fresh and delicious. The place is clean and the service is outstanding.  Apparently they have salsa dancing on the 1 and 3 Saturday of the month. I am definitely coming to that!!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Moroccan food for its fruit and savory flavors, the use of unrefined olive oil and spices--and most importantly--the communal dining experience underscored by great hospitality. It was these repeated experiences that brought us to this Tempe restaurant eager for another Moroccan fare. On this day, we were the first to arrive to the restaurant. The interior was large, spacious, with the vibe supported by natural sunlight, and a row of TVs placed along the walls. The interior also had a crepe and gelato bar. Being so close to the campus, the overall make up was conducive for large group gatherings.  We started off with a plate of Dolmas ($3.99) that came with rice wrapped in grape leaves. The centrality of the lemony flavor was a positive, and the leaves were easy to break into. The rice was more soggy than necessary, but it was good overall, especially when served warm.   The Chicken Tagine ($11.99) came with half of a chicken braised with onions, potatoes, preserved lemon, green olives, ginger, saffron, and cardamom. The base of the sauce was flavorful, but the chicken was small, uncut, boney, and difficult to share among the four of us. For the price, the portion on the chicken could be more generous. It was decent, but not amazing.  The Beef with Prunes Tagine ($11.99) came with four small cubes of beef braised with ginger, white pepper, garlic, apricots, and prunes. Again, the base sauce was fantastic, but the portion size was not good at all. The meat itself was too dry, and over reliant on the pool of sauce to keep us entertained. Not recommended.   The Mixed Grill ($13.99) was put together with skewers of beef, chicken, chicken leg, kefta kebob, rice, French fries, salad, and pita. There was too much filler, as the skewers were way too small except for the kefta. By this time I started to get the sense of being robbed. Not recommended.   Overall, we were pleased with the mix of seasonings and base flavors. However, the meat was too skimpy and inconsistent to worth another visit. I also find it unacceptable when the server gave us only two small pieces of bread to share among the four of us.  Lastly, we were extremely offended by the service throughout the entire meal. The server had a poor attitude, and clearly did not want to be there. Whenever we needed service, I had to walk across to the gelato bar to find her chatting with her friend. She was clearly reluctant when we asked about the items on the menu, and acted as if she was there to do us a favor. In the end, she had the audacity to tell us to all get out of our seats to walk to the entrance in order to pay. It was a poorly orchestrated meal, and when the food does not meet expectation, bad service only amplified the experience. Interested diners should opt for Couscous Express and Alzohour Market instead. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best quality of lamb chops in the Tempe area. Their rose water lemonade is also fabulous. Also, if you're down for the extra calories their crepes are super tasty and the fruit used is always fresh."}
{"text":"Newer restaurant.  Service was good although they messed up our order.  They did correct it and gave us a few free items to make up for the mistake.  That was a class act!  Food was good.  Worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I am usually satisfied about the food quality here. But today I ordered Chicken Tajine through Yelp. It turned out the chicken was only half cooked. The chicken breast was too hard to eat, and I could still see blood inside. I ended up throwing most of the chicken away. I guess I won't order that to go next time."}
{"text":"What a great experience! We went here for a Groupon and left fans. The hummus was delicious, but the star appetizer was the eggplant/tomato zaluuk. The aromatics and huge pieces of eggplant were delicious. Dip the flatbread in and you're in haven! The chicken schwarma was the moistest I have had in AZ. It was marinated and roasted perfectly. The décor is bright and there is a bar if you're so inclined. Outside dining on the ASU drag is available if that's your thing. There is a lounge with pillows for the dancing hours.  Clean, bright, Maria (manager) was so welcoming and able to help us choose items we would like. Give this a try! We will be back."}
{"text":"Food was was good just a little heavy for my liking. The experience was really cool! We got tea after dinner and that was one of my favorite parts of dinner. This place is also good for larger groups"}
{"text":"The was one of the best Moroccan restaurant's that I have been to. The food was superb. Very authentic. No shortage of flavor. If you are in the Phoenix area and you have not tried this place then you are missing out.  We will be back frequently."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful as well as affordable. We meal shared so that we could both taste everything. We started out with the green mint tea--tasty. We ordered the lamb couscous which was cooked to perfection. Then we ordered the Beef Tajins with prunes and apricots. That may sound weird but it was delicious These were coupled with a cucumber and red onion salad. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. While the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, they are a tad slow (which new restaurants are prone to be). Rather, this is a place to relax with friends and savor the experience. Why rush anyway?"}
{"text":"I went there first time and food was great.  Met the owner and a nice and friendly guy. You should try it. Great food.   F & B manager"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I ordered the lamb tagine and my girlfriend had the chicken tagine. We got hummus on the side and all the flavors were great. Super friendly staff. Definitely  recommend Moroccan paradise!"}
{"text":"The lamb chops were amazing and the service was great! I can't wait to eat there again...oh and try the mint tea!"}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday dinner and I had a wonderful experience! All the employees were super polite and really helpful, especially since it was my first time there. I ordered the poutine and mixed grill. For the price the serving size was actually really nice. All the BBQ was cooked perfectly with great seasoning and the rice had nice flavor too. The poutine tasted like simple cheese on fries but still I enjoyed it warm. Definitely would go back again and try their crepes, drinks, and breakfast items."}
{"text":"Wassim was our server and was very attentive and my glass on lemonaide was always full. He checked on us to make sure the food was perfect, and indeed it was.  I had the Kefta Kebab and you can tell from the picture, I destroyed it!   I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The was amazing!!!!! My gf, our daughter,  and I loved everything about this place... service was good and food was even better..."}
{"text":"Warning to middle easterners who know what authentic food is, this place is horrible. Ordered chicken and beef tagine. Forst of all, the meet was not cookes in the tagine. The chciken and beef were dry and bland. The tagina sause was thick and obviouslt made separately.  The chicken tasted like it was microwaved.  I cannot believe this place has 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on a whim to try Moroccan.  I ordered lamb chops, hummus & cucumber salad to go.  There was absolutely no flavor in any of my food.  The hummus was so bland it was near to nothing.  The small Lamb chops had no salt however were cooked medium when I asked for medium rare, so at least not well done - no taziki or any sauce was  with them.   Cucumber salad looked like it had dressing, however zero flavor.  So sad - was excited for a great new place when in Tempe.  I was the only customer - so technically no reason for not putting an ounce of love in my meal."}
{"text":"This place is definitely 5 stars! The food, service and the design of their restaurant is great! The gelato/dessert is a big plus. Theyre delicious. Me and my boyfriend  will surely eat here again."}
{"text":"Very good food but service was lacking.  Waitress asked us if we wanted appetizers and none of us even had menus.  When the entrees came out, it didn't come out at the same time.  The  last person got their food about 30 minutes after the first person.  If you can tolerate mediocre service, you will like this restaurant.  Then again, maybe they aren't skilled at serving a party of 14 people."}
{"text":"Moroccan Paradise, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Enjoy a little slice of Morocco and France (And Italy?) at this restaurant serving lovely foods such as tagine, crepes, and gelato.   The menu is pretty varied, with a mix of uniquely Moroccan foods, French food, Italian gelato, milkshakes, Mediterranean/Middle Eastern style food, and even French Canadian food (Poutine). It is quite a fusion of different cultures! I was excited to try their tagine. It is rare to find a restaurant that even offers this delectable dish. The prices were reasonable too, cheaper than what I've found at other restaurants that offer it.   We first started out with the zaaluk appetizer ($3.99). It was a blend of roasted eggplant and tomato, served with pita bread. We each ordered a beef with prunes tagine ($11.99) and a chicken tagine ($11.99). They came with a hearty portion of rice, and a basket of bread.  The beef was tender, with a delightful combination of savory and sweet flavors, and the sesame seeds provided an added textural difference with the soft, slow-cooked meat, fruit and vegetables. The chicken didn't seem like it was finished in a tagine (It seemed like it was roasted instead), since the meat and skin were browned and it didn't have the very moist, tender texture that a typical chicken tagine has. The spices and sauce itself was good though, and I liked the potatoes and green olives it came with. I enjoyed the light, fluffy rice with slightly crisp caramelized bits, and the bread went well with the tagines.  I also tried an Agadir milkshake ($5). It was touted as having almond gelato, milk, and honey. It was presented beautifully, but looking at it closer, I think I actually received a vanilla milkshake because I could see the bits of vanilla bean in it and I didn't actually taste any almond flavor. It was a lighter tasting milkshake, still good, but not super thick like most American style milkshakes are. It was more like a \"milk drink\" instead of a \"milkshake\".  Service was friendly and warm, and we were checked up on as needed. The restaurant occupies the space that Jorge's Chicken and Waffles used to be in, juxtaposing a hip, urban interior with more traditional Moroccan designs. The restaurant is open late, which is a draw for me (Until 11 P.M. or later depending on the day).   Here's looking at you, Moroccan Paradise! I'll be back to try more of your cuisine!"}
{"text":"Food and service are very good!   We had lamb chops. Meat was awesome but the rice could be better! The dish comes with salad and french fries."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Moroccan cuisine and I truly enjoyed it. We sat near the kitchen and had the pleasure of speaking directly to the chef who was very nice. We tried the hummus, sahkshuka, zaaluk, and falafel for appetizers which were all delicious. I particularly loved the sahkshuka and falafel. The bread was made in house and was amazing. For drinks we had a santiago and bora bora which are fruit drinks. Our meals were beef with prunes tanjine and beef cous cous, both very good. We had some gelato which was very tasty too. The service was great and we will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing is all I can say. I didn't expect to see some things on the menu- I've never tried Moroccan food and I was a little surprised to see chicken shawarma on the menu. I'm sorry I don't mean to offend anyone I am not geographically educated- we ordered the chicken tajine and the mixed grill platter. We also ordered the hummus and the zaaluk (a must try)  I hate onions... the onions that came with the chicken, I couldn't get enough of! The flavors are amazing!!!!  Marina was a tremendous help and had great knowledge of the menu. And super nice!!!!  We will definitely become regulars. And when Marina tells you they are large portions, listen to her....  if you want wonderful flavors please give them a try"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I tried Moroccan Paradise tonight.  The food was great, and Nora was knowledgable, helpful and friendly.  Based upon how she described the preparation and cooking of the Pompano Fish and the Chicken Tajine, I'm eager to try one of those next time.  I had the Kefta Kabob plate and I had to try their Shawarma too; both meats tasted wonderful and I loved the seasoning of the rice.  The added potato wedges were unexpected and excellent.  The salad was fresh but the dressing did not overwhelm me with flavor; healthy and a good contrast to the rest of the dish.  The tzatziki was perfect with the grilled stuff.  I didn't order the shakshuka which I haven't had for years...next time.  Another thing that will bring me back is that they have late hours----I think they are open until midnight.  The fountain drinks are self-serve.  The vibe is comfortable.  I didn't ask about alcohol or strong coffee..."}
{"text":"Love that there's Hookah and salsa music at one spot and the food  was awesome! The owner knew I was  visiting from Los Angeles and made extra effort to take care of us!!! Thank you #lovehookah #Moroconfood #Salsamusic #Salsadancer #Puertorican #Armenian #VisitingPhoenix"}
{"text":"Yeah.  A change of pace from your more standard \"Mediterranean\" or \"Middle Eastern\" joint, Moroccan Paradise offered up a delicious meal tonight for my family.  One of the specialties here is the tajine, or meat dish in sauce with vegetables and prunes with rice.  My wife really enjoyed hers, and my daughter equally liked the vegetable version with falafel.  As for me, I got the mixed grill--a fabulous combo of beef kabob, kefta kabob, chicken kabob, and chicken leg, served over rice and accompanied by salad, pita slices, and fried potatoes.  I'm full.  No baklava here, but they make up for it with huge array of mixed juices, milkshakes, and crepes.  The desserts take up multiple pages on the menu!  This is easily one of our favorite restaurants of its kind now.  We will be coming back--even if just for dessert. :)  Not just \"Middle Eastern\" or \"Mediterranean\"-- it's More Rockin'.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best mediterranean and Moroccan food and place to eat in all of AZ for great great price! Take it from a middle eastern   1. The service was incredible for all the times I've been there, with a small group and big group!  2.i called 30 minutes and they reserved a tabled for 12 people and the owner is soo sooooo nice and accommodating! I've never seen someone so smiley and happy to see customers so Much in my life, he was very inviting and respectful and my whole family really appreciated that   3. THE FOOD IS AMAZING! The owner had taken out one of the things from the menu and when I asked him about it he made it for me!  4. The place is super clean, authentic, cultured and super cool interior. And its perfect for literally anyone! We had 5 kids with us and they were all treated so nicely   This is one of my all time favorite place to eat mainly because of how amazing the food is and how incredible of a service they have.  Thank you so much"}
{"text":"I went to Morocco last summer and the food was amazing, even from the markets and outside stands. I've been craving it ever since. I found this place through groupon and thought I would give it a try. I've been here twice and the service both times was great. I've gotten the tea, lamb tajine, lamp chops, the mixed grilled platter and casablanca crepe. Although it seems like their menu might have change since the last time I was there. I love how they uses lamb chops for the tajine. Everything was pretty flavorful, except the couscous I got was a little on the dry side. I also like that they have a variety of interesting crepe flavors and other cool desserts. This place definitely brings back the good tastes and memories of morocco. Would definitely recommend it if you want a taste Morocco in Phx."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional! I got the golden Pomona fish dish and my fiancée ordered the beef Tajine and they were so tasty. Never have we ever had food like that & ate our whole meal. I was hoping for Moroccan styled desserts, but it was simply gelato and fruity shakes. But overall, a well deserved 5 stars for amazing food! Everyone needs to come here"}
{"text":"I love trying new foods, especially Mediterranean foods and this place gets it. The Moroccan born owner really knows his food and his service. Their signature dish of tajine is supurb, I wish it was bigger. There's more to come with this place including music and daily specials. Now if they can just come to Downtown Phoenix they'd really get my love."}
{"text":"I received a flyer for this restaurant from a friend and I was sooo anxious to try it out all week.  Finally Friday was here and the place was packed. Very exciting vibe :-) and everyone looked so happy while eating loll. It took a long while for the waitress to take our order. But we knew exactly what we wanted. It took another long while for the food to come out. The waitress apologized and we all got free gelato for the unexpected wait. So no hard feelings :-) Finally our food came out. We ordered lamb cous cous. Kefta kabob sandwich. And the beef and prune tijine (sorry if I mispelled it). However in place of the beef and prune dish, they gave us beef and 5 vegetables...I was excited to try the prune dish, and obviously wasn't expecting the vegetable dish. But no worries - I wanted to try everything anyway. Remember, I memorized the menu from the flyer already :-P The lamb cous cous was amaaaazing. The lamb was sooo yummy. And it was my first time trying cous cous so I was scared, but pleasantly surprised.  The beef and vegetables were not bad. Not amazing but not bad. The rice it came with was sooo good and my son ate it all up The beef kefta burger was alright. Something different than most places, better for lunch rather than dinner so my mistake :-p The Santiago drink was delicious too. So fresh  Overall great restaurant. Well worth the wait. Friendly staff. Owner came to everyone's table and greeted everyone. One of the cooks is a sweet Arab lady who I couldn't understand but was still lovingly speaking to our family.  Can't wait to try all the fruit deserts and crepes!"}
{"text":"I went to Moroccan Paradise on a whim because I was hungry right before work and it sounded interesting. I was the only customer in the place, which I can understand because it's Monday and I assume that's one of the slowest days for the restaurant business. I ordered the beef gyro sandwich combo which came with a salad and a soda. The price was good. It was less than $10 after tip. The meat on the sandwich was just ok. It was pretty dry and didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped for, but it wasn't terrible. The service was pretty good. The girl who helped me was very nice and personable. From first impression perspective, I would have to say that this place isn't as authentic as I was hoping for, but I'd be willing to give it another shot and maybe try one of the recommended dishes instead of the beef gyro sandwich."}
{"text":"AMAZING! As a half moroccan guy the food here is great. Cooked to perfections. The prices and quantity of the food is more than perfect."}
{"text":"We went to here because of the yelp review. We got the mixed grill meat. The kefta and fries were flavorful but the rest was bland. Should have read more or ask what their specialties were."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout though Yelp, when I arrived they said they didn't have my order and said nothing was in their system. I had already paid for the meal and staff didn't seem like they cared. Didn't even offer to make it on the spot. After getting notification from their boss they made my food. Not sure why they have Yelp Takeout if they aren't checking for orders. To make things worse the food tasted terrible. The soup tasted canned, chicken shawarma was cold, and the extra pita I ordered was hard!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday around 6pm to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary.  Surprisingly the place was virtually empty.  The server was extremely nice and took good care of us.  She mentioned that she is a nurse but she is taking a break from that.  We ordered the vegetarian platter (appetizer), beef tajine, and mixed grill.  The platter doesn't come with enough bread so our server brought us more.   The kitchen prepared a chicken tajine instead of the beef.  The owner was kind enough to not charge us for that plate.    My wife had a mango margarita which she said was perfect.   The desert was a nutella crape with a scoop of gelato.  I thought it was odd that there was a gelato case in a Moroccan restaurant so I asked about it.  I was told that Morocco was close to Italy so gelato is also part of their restaurant scene.    You need to pay at the reception table like at a diner.  They have a really cool iPad looking device that swivels.  The owner told me that it keeps track of trends and advises them on their hot sellers.  It can even be used as a punch-in clock for the employees.    Overall, I enjoyed the food but I can see why some reviews said that it was bland.  The tajine sauce was fantastic.  I just put that on everything to give the needed boost of flavor.  I was told that in 2 weeks they will have a belly dancer.  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"We went on a whim since neither of us had ever had Moroccan food before and we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We both got the mixed grill to get a sample and our favorite was the kefta kebab. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered the best mixed grill and extra lamb plate. They have the best crepes i ordered 2 different kinds of crepes and the opener let me taste their gelato and it was some of the best I've ever had. Next time I have to try the Moroccan mint tea it. I was too full by that time."}
{"text":"I'm just visiting from San Diego and I found this Ethiopian restaurant. This place have lots of variety of food. Great customer service and not pricey at all. I had the grilled golden pompano and my bf had the chicken Tanji with olives and chicken kebab. Everything is so yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood to try something new and we haven't had Moroccan since moving to the valley from Chicago 2 1/2 years ago.  We were in this area and decided to check Yelp for someplace new to try... We were not disappointed!!  The place is clean and nicely decorated with lively Moroccan music setting the atmosphere.  The service was attentive, fast & very helpful and friendly and the food was delicious!  I had the mixed grill of kabobs and my husband had the beef & prunes tagine.  We also had the poutine appetizer and a gelato dessert!  Everything was wonderful, we will define be back and bring fiends!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, customers will not be disappointed. We went Friday night, and since ASU is closed, there weren't any other customers.   The restaurant is very nicely decorated and organized and was very clean. We were greeted very cordially by the server. My wife  ordered the grilled fish, and I ordered the mixed grill. For the price the quantity was very good.  The rice tasted excellent, and so was the grilled chicken, beef and lamb, and of course the fish. We also ordered the drinks, one was the santiago, and I can't remember the other one. Both were excellent. The server and the owner both came by and inquired on the quality of the food.   I was also impressed that the men's room was very clean. That indicates a clean kitchen.   I will be visiting again since these guys quite possibly serve the best Middle Eastern/Moroccan food around here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Moroccan Paradise this evening. The staff was friendly, the owner was wonderful to chat with and the food was delicious. We had the Zaaluk as an appetizer and wow was it good. My wife and I each had a Tajine and the Chicken was so wonderful.   This is worth the visit and I encourage you to help make this new place make history. We did not do a desert, but I wanted one. They all looked really good.   Bill"}
{"text":"I've never had Moroccan food so we found this place on Yelp and wanted to check it out.   We came during lunch time during the week. I ordered the mixed grill. This comes with a beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken leg and another beef sausage. It also comes with rice, fries and a salad. The portion is actually pretty good. I recommend sharing if you don't eat a lot like me. I loved both of the beef kabobs. I thought the chicken was a bit over cooked and dry. Everything else on the plate was absolutely delicious though.   All of their desserts looked really good so we ended up trying the gelato. Strawberry, pistachio, and tiramisu. All delicious!!  I think that the only thing this place is missing is alcohol! I loved that the owner wanted our input on the food after so they can better their business! I'd come back!"}
{"text":"The Vegetarian Combo Platter, from the appetizer menu, included the best FALAFAL I've ever had. It was lovely and moist inside, crispy outside. I have always sort of liked Falafal, but I didn't even know it could be that good. And I would be really torn to have to chose a favorite between the eggplant thing (ZAALUK) and the tomato and roasted red pepper thing (SHASHUKA). They were divine! 4th on the Platter was the Hummus which was a little different somehow, but also excellent.  My husband also ordered the Poutine (if you love gravy on french fries, this is the best you'll find).  I ordered the Beef Tajine (with Prunes) and it was lovely but not the best choice for me because I'm sensitive to onion and although onion isn't listed on the menu it's a MAJOR player in this dish.  My husband ordered the Lamb Chops which were absolutely perfect! These little meat gems are easy to dry out, but they were spot-on.  Then we splurged for dessert and sadly they didn't have any gelato that night, but we ordered the Marinasmir - which was a combination I would never have imagined, but it worked pretty well.  Our waiter was right there with information when we needed it, and described things well. Unfortunately, I didn't ask him about my dish before I experienced the onions, but that's my bad.  In short, service was good, the food was delightful. I would return just for the Vegetarian Combo Platter ANY day of the week, but don't stop there!"}
{"text":"Food was great, we all got the mixed grill and loved it. The steak is the best part for sure!!"}
{"text":"I take my wife and her nephew (from Vietnam) here on a weeknight after planning and talking it up, I find it CLOSED.  The sign says CLOSED.  Developing a new concept soon.    Luckily it was just two doors down from Curry Corner, a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"We just had Father's Day lunch there today. There were 15 of us, which has proven to be difficult in the past so we called ahead. They were ready for our party as soon as we walked in the door. The staff was so nice and attentive, they answered all our questions and made us feel comfortable. Our glasses of water were constantly filled, everyone's food arrived at the same time and it was all hot. No cold food served here! I had the mixed grill, which included chicken, a beef kabob, chicken kabob and lamb sausage. Everything we tried was so delicious! For desert I had the Casablanca. Also delicious! I would highly recommend this place, especially for groups. After lunch we were able to all just sit an enjoy each other's company for a while and the staff never made us feel rushed. I live in Avondale but I will definitely be driving back to this place again!"}
{"text":"We wanted one more special meal on our Spring Break vacation before returning home. Moroccan Paradise provided us with just that opportunity.  The Chicken and Vegetable Cous Cous was presented beautifully and was especially good with the two sauces. I am particularly fond of the raisin sauce, which was sweet with hints of cinnamon and cardamom. The rest of our party explored the kebab, tajine and kebsa dishes on the menu; the consensus was \"Wonderful\".  As an extra bonus, Moroccan Paradise has a variety of fancy fruit drinks, gelatos, crepes and pancakes. The bright colors and fresh flavors are a perfect match for the friendly, welcoming energy we experienced throughout our meal. Even without eating dinner at Moroccan Paradise, it is a great place to stop in for a fruit drink on a hot day, or finish the evening off with a lively dessert. Most of my group tried various gelato flavors, while I thoroughly enjoyed the Gaspé crepe.  Be sure to make the time for a meal at Moroccan Paradise. It's a great experience!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place ZERO stars. This was disappointing on so many levels.  We went here to break our fast. Having read the reviewes quickly, we were confident it would be OK. This is probably the first time reviews have let us down. The choice of food was very limited and very tasteless. Queued up for the lamb and was told it finished (what???). We didnt come late either! The plates and cutlery were disposable - probably the single most annoying thing here. They can't be bothered to wash so gives the thinnest polystyrene plates and tiny plastic forks and spoons. The fork I was using broke twice so I had to eat with my hands in the end. It was not more than 20 minutes after fast broke and they started cleaning the place up. Again, whaat??? Let your customers eat the sub-par food they are eating! WIll definitely not be going here again, even if the food was free."}
