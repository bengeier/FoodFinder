{"text":"The food was great. There were few little bones, but for the price I couldn't complain. Also, the people were nice."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas, we wanted to try something local so we found this place on Yelp.  We stopped by and scouted it first, my wife and nephew looked at the buffet selection and said the food looked good.  So we stayed to try it out.  When I went in, the food did look good, except for a couple of dishes that looked dry and old (it was near closing).  I tried the lechon kawale, beef steak, pancit, mongo beans, and fried rice.  Good: cheap buffet!  They have a big flatscreen playing NBA playoffs, place is clean.  Bad: Fried and steamed rice were dry/hard, lechon was bland even with juffran sauce, beek steack was salty, pancit was bland, mongo beans too dry, and the service was not there.  The lady at the counter just stood there without talking to anybody or taking  our dirty plates.  Will not come back here.  Next time we'll try the other place down the street."}
{"text":"Very happy that they opened this location. Very good deal for AYCE $7.99..but if you can't do the buffet, you can order the 2-item combo for $4.99! For rice or pancit w/ 2 items..you can even do a \"split\" and do half-rice/half-pancit. My only advice is if you plan to eat here, don't come too close to closing time as the food choices might not be as plentiful. Seating can be an issue as others have noted, but can't really blame them if everyone wants to grub on good filipino food~~FILIPINOS love a good deal! Overall, this is definitely a great place to get some filipino grub."}
{"text":"Came here with the family once, and it's definitely in the \"fast food\" category. The options were decent and the price was affordable, but none of the options were particularly delicious.   I mean, you can't really expect much from a buffet with so many pre-made selections, but it doesn't really taste like Filipino home cooking. Just tastes like Filipino fast-cooking."}
{"text":"$7.99 for a delicious buffet is a great deal.  I don't know the names of the dishes on the buffet but every dish I ate was yummy, except for some bitter tasting fish stew type dish.  Until eating here I never knew how delicious crispy fish skin could be.  Their soda machine wasn't working but they had canned sodas so all was good.  It is a bit confusing when you walk in because the cash register is partially hidden over halfway into the restaurant.  All in all I enjoyed my experience here and will be back."}
{"text":"awesome deal for a good filipino buffet!  I haven't been to the one near Goldilocks on Maryland  yet, but this is one of the better places for filipino food in Vegas.  I took my mom here and she liked it.  The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I wish there were more variety of dishes, most seem to be just pork.  I would love some Kare Kare too! :)"}
{"text":"Driving aimlessly up and down Eastern Avenue trying to find a place to relax and have lunch during my work day, I saw the the sign they have outside advertising the buffet.  A quick Yelp search yielded great reviews and I was sure I had stumbled upon a new weekly lunch spot.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  I tried some of everything and most items were extremely salty.  I did enjoy the fried rice and the fried rice noodles, but the actual dishes were salty to the point of being almost inedible.  The quality of the meat was also suspect.  At least two or three dishes featured chicken that was simply overcooked, dry, and had that taste of unflavored boiled chicken covered in a sauce.    The pork dishes had the same problem.  It tasted like the pork was boiled on its own without seasoning and then mixed with an overly salty sauce.  And this applied to the beef dishes as well.  The pork and the beef itself was pretty fatty and \"stringy\".  I excitedly loaded up my first plate and was very disappointed when each thing I tried was too salty to eat.  And it just wasn't worth eating, since the meat was worse than the sauce.  The fried items offered were all very dried out.  There were a few whole fried sardines, which were pretty sad looking.  They also had fried chicken, but it looked like it had been sitting out for quite a while and pretty unappetizing.  Dessert was just some sliced watermelon.  With all the salt, the watermelon was a nice way to end the meal.  I ended up thirsty the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of this place.... UNTIL I found a freaking BAND-AID IN MY SOUP.  I told the cook about it and he just apologized and threw the soup out. They didn't even bother giving me and my friend a refund until I complained about how I didn't eat. And the guy only ended up giving me one refund when there were two people eating out of the soup -____-"}
