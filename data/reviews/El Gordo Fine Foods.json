{"text":"This is the best food in Kensington.  They have new food stations, with wonderful food.  I strongly recommend the Green Tostada.  Each flavour and ingredient was amazing.  The chefs are extremely kind and pay a great attention to detail.  Treat yourself and go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I originally came to El Gordo to check out Agave Y Aguacate but after waiting 15 minutes while the cook was chatting with someone who didn't look like she was ordering anything, I gave up.  

Instead I had a chorizo empanada from the station that's furthest in the back on the right. When he asked if I wanted a spicy one, he also advised that there was either chipotle or jalapeno. I opted for chipotle. For $3, it was delicious.  Just enough spice for a kick (but I wouldn't call it spicey, I'll have to try the jalapeno one next time), stuffed with bits of chorizo, spicy and it had a nice crust.  Perfect to take on the go since it isn't messy. 

In the front of the store, they have all their baked goods. Churros are made fresh (you can see machine churning out the dough) and are fantastic. I have to resist every time I come to Kensington. 

I do love my cheap eats."}
{"text":"Forget about the great vintage boutiques, cheap produce and specialty food shops - the BEST thing about Kensington is the variety of walk-and-eat snack selections. I thiiiiiiiiiink this may be my favourite of the bunch. (And it's a good bunch.)

Go ahead, walk in. Push the door latch up, not down. Theeerre you go. Don't be overwhelmed by the massive chicken scratch menu on the wall; there are many empanadas to choose from, but at $3, you can always come back and try another until you find your favourite. Just close your eyes and pick a random, even. Perrrrfect.

Jerk it up a little with some hot sauce if you're feeling frisky. Me? Well, this isn't about me, is it - but since you're asking, I do love some heat on my ricotta-cheddar-mozzarella.  But if I get the unique and fantastic kimchi-chicken, then I'll just keep that mother as is. It's kind of perfect like that.

You got a little sauce on your chin - ok, it's gone. Satisfied? Wonderful. Let's come back next time and try one of their NEW FRUIT EMPANADAS.

**to be continued**"}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to eat at Kensington! I usually love the empanadas especially the potatoes one! Reasonable priced at 4$ each or 3 for 10$. 

Churros are quite good too."}
{"text":"Great way to try new foods. A lot of choices, just ask and they will help you out. Only change would be the taco vender, ok food but nothing I would go for again. Stick with the charros and empanada venders. Do not be taken back by the confusing outside, step inside and try it out."}
{"text":"The delicious smell of freshly made churros hit me as soon as I walked in here. My mouth watered, and I knew I just had to have one, or two. I got four churros which is $4.50, and I think a single one is $1.25. 

The churros were handed to me piping hot, and you have the option of putting either chocolate or caramel inside them One bite, and I was transported back to my childhood. These churros are absolutely delicious! Crispy and covered in sugar outside, slightly soft inside, with the chocolate or caramel sauce overflowing slightly as you bite into them.

They also have a variety of Mexican breads and other baked goods, but I didn't try any, although they all looked delicious. At the back there is an arepas counter, and their famous empanadas. 

The girl who helped me was really nice and sweet, and made small conversation with me. Its nice to get service with a smile! 

I cannot wait to return and try out their arepas and fresh breads, also its been a long while since I've had their empanadas, so I want to go back and try those again.

Also, they only take cash, though the girl told me that they will be offering debit and credit soon :)"}
{"text":"El Gordo Fine Foods is the umbrella name for everything in and around Pancho's Bakery (as seen from Augusta) and is known for their empanadas. Always changing and morphing, this mini mall of South and Central American food delights me in new ways every time I go into the place and get greeted by the churro guy in the front. (The latest being an awesome shared patio out back!!!!)  I understand these guys busting themselves trying to make a living by serving up what they know - snack food from back home. This is as good as it gets! No pretentiousness or surly wait staff to greet you or ignore you or aggravate you, just really good food. Yesterday I tried Ramillo's tostadas because my usual (Don's Taco stand) was empty. I was blown away by Ramillo's incredible beef tostada with the presentation, pride and care that was so obviously poured onto that little plate. Crunchy-crispy fried tortilla topped with tasty bits of beef, incredible savoury hot sauce, bits of shredded beets, lettuce, tomatoes, a wonderful mix of flavours! I will be back to try some of the other tostadas he makes soon! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Delicious South American eats prepared while you wait.

One star off because the signage is terrible (I walked past it twice trying to find it) and their hours are inaccurate on Yelp so they closed about 5 minutes after I ordered."}
{"text":"El Gordo is at the back of Pancho's Bakery. The tostadas are extremely delicious although seem a bit pricy for their size. I had a Tengo tostada that was a spicy mixture of chicken, beans, avocado and red onions. The flank steak tostado also seemed to be fairly popular. You may have to wait a bit since there is always a lineup."}
{"text":"It's a fast empanada fix.  Good crust but the stuffing in mine was a tad dry.  Will try some different flavours next time."}
{"text":"The place itself is a 4 star, 
The food is maybe a 3 star depending on what you get.

Likes: Many different vendors; confusing and not quite sure if they are together or separate; a tasty snack.

Dislikes: Depending on what you get I feel it's either super good/authentic to watered-down flavours.

I probably wouldn't come back, but I do appreciate the charm and hope it hangs around for a long time."}
{"text":"A great take-out empanda place with about 30 different types listed on the board. What they lack in decor they make up for in taste. It's perfect for running in and grabbing a tasty inexpensive snack when you're in the market."}
{"text":"There are few places better to experience the multiculturalism of Toronto than Kensington Market. And while you're in this 'hood, do not miss picking up a snack at El Gordo. 

Holy, their chorizo Mexican cheddar empanadas are good! We bought an assortment of empanadas from El Gordo but barely made it out the door before scarfing them down."}
{"text":"Was not open during business hours. Said it was open too 1 am and closed before midnight."}
{"text":"10 dolars for 3 big empanadas! The taste  is great and they have a lot of kinds and options. The spicy empanadas are VERY spicy!"}
{"text":"Magic. Absolute magic. El Gordo is one of about six stalls inside a literal hole in the wall. It's the most amazing place to eat. Three of my friends and I were doing a Kensington food crawl yesterday and so we came in here and ate at almost every stall inside. We ordered El Gordo's ceviche ($10). For an extra dollar, you can add shrimp, but I opted out. The display picture makes the bowl look rather large for the price, so I was skeptical at how large the portion would be, but the picture did it justice. It's a very generous portion for $10 and it comes with a lot of chunks of fish and scallops. 

I'm no ceviche expert, but my best description would be salsa if it were made of chunky seafood. I really appreciate that they left the seafood extra chunky. The fish was fresh and the scallops were sweet, which is the way they should be. My only minor gripe was that the chips for the ceviche were served in the same bowl as the ceviche, so some of them were wet before we even picked them up. 

All in all, a cheap eat, and one I'd do again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"So, I walked by today, shortly after writing my review and the El Gordo sign is down and it says \"Pancho Bakery\" and \"Arepa Cafe\".  So, if you are looking for the old El Gordo, this is where you have to go."}
{"text":"Top notch taco joint. A group of us indulged on the 3 tacos for $10. I opted for the chicken, beef and carnita taco (pork) and was amazed by how flavourful the tacos were. The soft shell tortilla was fresh and thick enough so it didn't fall apart despite the taco being loaded with meat and other garnishes. The meat was well seasoned and not over salted (like most joints) If you're in the Kensington market I would highly recommend this as worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is a controversial statement: I don't really love empanadas. They are too much of something for me. Flakey? Too flakey? Also, I'm totally overwhelmed by the 41 (according to Connie T.) types on offer, plus, I always ask for at least three before finding one they have available.

But! I love El Gordo, and their new, ish, delicious arepas! I really recommend an arepa. It's like a corn-style English muffin (delicious!) stuffed with amazing, delicious things. My favourite is beef, beans, and plantain but that is maybe because it's the only kind of tried. The others (chicken and avocado, especially) look great but I am pretty committed to this delicious combo. The beef is of the saucy, pulled variety - so so good. Also they give you a weirdly refreshing sugar cane drink. 

I guess the advantage of an empanada is that it is easier to walk and eat. The arepa is a sit-down-and-focus affair (with a fork!), but that's how I like to eat (minus the fork). 

After the arepa, you can get a churro, fill it with dulce de leche, and continue through the market, feeling much much better about your awesome lunch decision."}
{"text":"** 4.5 Stars ** 

Kensington Market is changing and so is El Gordo - to an amazing place! They're adding more Latin flavour to this place with \"stations\" of different latin and south american foods. 

They've kept the front of the store as the mexican bakery with the delicious churros but in the back they've expanded on the Empanadas with Pupusas and Arepas, each made fresh with their own designated chef. Andreas makes a mean pupusa right in front of your eyes and for $3 it comes with a small side salad and guacamole! Best lunch ever? Quite possibly! 

The only gripe I have is the lack of proper seating (the reason for the -0.5 star) but apparently they're still in the transition phase and the layout and seating of the place will be fixed up soon.

I can't wait to come back here, the staff are friendly, food is tasty and extremely cheap, how can you refuse!?"}
{"text":"Not a fancy restaurant or anything but damn this food court has the best tacos I have ever had... I ordered a chilaca which is a taco with this huge yellow colored pepper that is grilled to perfection with chorizo as my meat filling and mild hot sauce.  The tortilla was also grilled till it was nice and crispy too. This awesome taco only costs $5, plus was stuffed with lots of filling.  An awesome deal.  My friend got a beef burrito, which I didn't try but she really enjoyed it for $8 and couldn't even finish it even though she wished she could because it was really good!!!  I've been to some really authentic Mexican places both in Canada and the United States and this place is definitely one of my favorites now!!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day with a friend, deciding that I wouldn't get any food, but since munching on some of his empanadas, have sorely regretted not getting any for myself while I was there. The biggest question is, how did I manage to get my friend to share any of that? It's too good to be giving any of it away! 

They also have pupusas and churros and all things wonderful in this low-key latin food mart."}
{"text":"I'm craving for one of these right now as I write this. 

With other empanada joints in the market, El Gordo is certainly a place I'll venture into for cheap snack on-the-go. 

They have a vast menu of choices but depending on the time of day, they may not have the one you've been craving for. Despite this, for three whole bucks you can try a new flavour as you continue your visit of Kensington."}
{"text":"I came here for the tacos and the tacos only. This little market was tricky to find but boy, is it a gem! Came here with my s/o and boy, the place was hot. We got 2 shrimp tacos, 2 fish and the one that has bacon bits in it (I forgot what it was called). It was $5 and for me, that was well worth it. Each taco was packed to the point that when we took a bite of our tacos, the filling was oozing out, causing this meal to be extremely messy! My favorite was the shrimp ones because the shrimps weren't incredibly small and they gave us 5 in each taco which was awesome for me.

I also found it intriguing that there was a sink near the back where the tables were, making it extremely convenient for messy eaters for people like me. Also, their hot sauce was AWESOME. It was extremely spicy, tolerable, but definitely delicious (in moderation)

And I know I said I came for the tacos but I also bought some churros (with different sauce fillings.. like what?!?!!!!!) on the way out. They were crispy, not overly sweet, but perfect with the sauce that they put in it. I forgot all the flavors they had but I got the chocolate, caramel and strawberry filling and it was delicious. 

I also wanted to try some empanadas but I stood in front of the cash register for about 10 minutes like an idiot, waiting for someone to come but they never showed? Oh well."}
{"text":"Only had mixed vegetable left when we got there but these piping hot pockets of goodness were stuffed w/ tons of vegs and cheddar cheese.  Crust a bit salty for me though so make sure you have a beverage handy."}
{"text":"Must have bad taste. But got a churro from here. Meh. Was not to amazed. I must return!"}
{"text":"As everyone knows, Toronto is a city mostly populated by dumb excuses to spend the salary you inexplicably moved here for. But Gordo's makes an amazing chicken empanada that is like a spicy handheld chicken pot pie, and it costs $4. Don't get them too late in the day, though, or they'll be dry. The guy who sells empanadas is a wonderful and friendly person."}
{"text":"I had heard all the rave about Agave Y Aguacate, but when I dropped in the other day there was a lineup of about 8 ppl and I didn't wanna waste time. I decided to go past the lineup to the back where a guy had some round dough thing on the flat grill. Turns out it is something called a pupusa, which I've never had before, but it looked good!!! 

After quickly going through the list, I settled on a Santigo Verde, which was described as spinach, garlic, and chorizo. I wasn't really sure where all that stuff went but it turns out he takes a big ball of dough, makes a well and stuffs it inside and closes it up. Then he flattens it and on it goes to the grill. It was about a 6 min wait for the pupusa, but well worth it! He takes a lot of care in making the plate of food for you. It comes with a little bit of meh coleslaw, some other really refreshing salad, and three dots of really hot, but oh so good, sauces that I think he said were made from habanero peppers. There was also a small scoop of chunky guacamole made from fresh avocados I added a small cup of fresh lemonade he had on the table. 

$6 for a pretty amazing meal."}
