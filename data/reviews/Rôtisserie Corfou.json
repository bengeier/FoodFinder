{"text":"I am normally not a fan of grilled chicken; I tend to prefer my bird fried and crispy. This place made me understand that it's not necessary to fry in order to get crispy, delicious chicken. 

Heavily spiced (though not at all spicy), the whole leg was served atop a mound of crispy fries that quickly sucked up spices and chicken fat in order to trade their crispiness for flavor-soaked goodness. Even the grilled pita was surprisingly tasty, with a sprinkling of spices that complemented those in the main dish.

I was tempted to remove a star because the place isn't well set up for dining in. Paper plates and plastic silverware don't do justice to the quality of food on offer, and yet I feel like takeaway would cause the meal to lose some of its magic. 

But a lack of frills is a small price to pay for this kind of quality. I'm delighted to find this spot right next to Hotel 10, where I tend to stay when I'm in Montreal. I will definitely be back. It might be tomorrow."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Anthony was super friendly and showed a great passion for food that is hard to find in many other small restaurant owners in Downtown Montreal. 

I perhaps ordered one of the best poutines I've had in a long time; fries were crispy, curds were warm and chewy, and the gravy was thick and delicious. The grilled chicken was just a beautiful addition to an already perfect dish. I devoured it in minutes. You get your money's worth; I left the restaurant very full after just that one poutine.

Would recommend to anyone looking to have a good, solid meal while watching Guy Fieri yell at food on the widescreen television by the counter. A good time all around."}
{"text":"Came here on one of my many random treks through the downtown core. Service was great. The owner/manager was very inviting and cordial in handling my many questions about various aspects of Montreal and how much spice is too much, etc. 

The food was great too. The chicken was moist on the inside and had a bit of crisp on the outside with a good mix of flavour to it. The meat was tender with just enough pull so it didn't immediately fall apart at the mere touch. Which makes it great for going all bare hands in. Though utensils are also provided for those not keen on making too much of a mess.

Anyways I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone who's looking for good food.

P.S. For my Muslim peeps, this place is halal so no religious guilt afterwards"}
{"text":"Calling all Sparta Rotisserie fans - this is the new and improved version, owned by one of the partners of Sparta. 
Inside it is simple and casual, great for a quick but delicious & filling no frills meal.
We ordered half a chicken (ask for spicy!) trio with a large tzatziki and extra pita bread. The chicken was huge and super juicy, it was absolutely delicious. All the aromatic Greek seasonings accompanied with fresh pita bread, tzatziki and fries tossed in spices and olive oil, every bite truly was heavenly. 
Prices are very reasonable and portions are huge! If you are looking for authentic Greek souvlaki, this is the place to go. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch time with a friend. Located on the corner of Sherbooke and St-Laurent street, this restaurant offers what they claim is the most tender chicken in the city. Although their claim is a little extravagant, their food is decent.

I opted for their 2 thighs combo, which came with 2 pieces of chicken thigh, fries, a piece of pita, and a drink. The total came to about 15$ for the full meal. The flavors of the chicken were well seasoned overall, with a very strong lemon-y taste, which to be honest, I am not a big fan of. About the texture itself, while ok, was far from their claim of being the most tender chicken of the city! Fries were standard.

Overall, decent lunch place, but I will definitively make a detour to come back."}
{"text":"Really really good chicken. Tender, moist, well seasoned, just really tasty.
The greek spin is a nice variation. Instead of rotisserie chicken with bland fries and sauce, you get seasoned fries, pita and tzatziki... Can't go wrong there!
Location is perfect after a night out.
Customer service is one of the best for the area. Owner is really nice, polite and funny which is unfortunately becoming very uncommon in Montreal. 
New place that's looking up. A must try!"}
{"text":"Juiciest and Best flavoured chicken I've had in Montreal. Better than Romados. Friendly staff aswell"}
{"text":"I ordered a combination plate and got one small chicken skewer, a huge pile of french fries, a piece of grilled bread and a can of soda. I was really disappointed. It wasn't a meal. It was a heap of cheap carbs. I'll try this place again because I liked the bit of chicken I got, but I didn't like this meal."}
{"text":"Excellent poutine! The fries are perfect, gravy is just the right amount of saltiness and not gooey like some other places. They are also generous with the cheese curds.

The service is fast and friendly and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"WOW! I got the spicy grilled chicken pita and I truly cannot put into words just how incredibly tasty it was. I knew it would be amazing just based off how good it smelled in the restaurant but nothing compares to that first bite. If you want a flavorful meal, go Corfu. I will definitely be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to go to for chicken in Montr√©al. The chicken is never frozen and is marinated for two days and this is very apparent in the the taste. I had the spicy version of the chicken and I keep going back for the same thing over and over again. Somewhat reasonably priced and a nice tiny place to eat that is open late. I love this spot. I just wish that they had something with gravy to mix with the rice."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place with wonderful Greek-style chicken.  We had chicken souvlaki, roasted chicken leg and the chicken pita. Nice portions, and the food was delicious. If you pay extra to substitute a Greek salad for the fries, you get a huge piece of feta on top. We would come here again if we lived here."}
{"text":"Delicious. We got the chicken breast combo (breast, fries, rice and drink) and the chicken poutine. Both amazing. The seasoning (spice rub) on the chicken is SO good. The kind of meal where you're both silent because you're too busy shoveling food into your face.

Portions are generous. The owner was super friendly and personable. Atmosphere is casual, low key, and was quiet on a Thursday night. Prices are great. We had a lovely meal here and will go again!"}
