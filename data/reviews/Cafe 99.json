{"text":"They have a new chef his name is Don. His specialty is Memphis style BBQ.  He is a great chef. He approach ed us asking questions about our tastes and opinions in the food we had eaten.  I had chili cheese frys and my husband had Frito pie. My friend had chili cheese dog. The chili was fresh and chunky and wonderful.  The experience was one of the best here. The food is back to being awesome. With a new flair. I feel like they welcome feed back and actually care what the consumer has to say and act on it."}
{"text":"No stars!!!!! 
Bad service! Worse food! Manager has a real bad attitude!!!!!!!!!!
Don't ever bother to go there!
It totally sucked!
These people have no idea of how to prepare or serve food!"}
{"text":"we were there at 12:40 PM. They had no white bread and no coffee made. The food was very mediocre. My wife's BLT was terrible The bacon was all she could eat. I tried the ribs. They give you a steak  knife, you definitely need it. Probably the some of the worst ribs I have eaten. The waitress did a good job but it seems this restaurant was trying to go out of business. I gave it one star because to of the waitresses good service."}
{"text":"We decided to try the BBQ ribs here when it popped up as a nearby deal on Groupon. Was sold as a deal for a restaurant called dewd ranch bbq. Had a difficult time finding the place since the only sign near the building reads Cafe 99. After searching the whole strip mall we just happened to see small sheets of paper on the doors that read Dewd Ranch BBQ so we went inside to find an old run down dirty restaurant. Almost didn't stay but we really wanted ribs and had already bought the Groupon.  On the way to our table it was hard not to notice the sticky flours made walking noisy so that was worrisome. AFTER getting our drinks we knew what we came for and told the waitress we were there for the ribs. Her shocking reply was \"were all out of ribs until Tuesday\".  We saw that as our out and nearly ran out the door and cancelled our Groupon for a refund. Won't be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Wanted so much for this place to be wonderful. But our first time was not so good. Husband had the Ham and Eggs, asked for extra gravy on his hash browns. The ham and hash browns were burnt - husband's words: ham is like shoe leather. Gravy on the hash browns was so thin, it sank into the hash browns so quickly it was as if no gravy at all.  His toast was cold.
I ordered the special: 2 X Texas french toast with 2 X thick sliced bacon. Again the hash browns were on the burnt side. The french toast arrived cold on the outside and the inside. As for Texas size - not so much - pretty thin for Texas!  If you like you bacon on the crispy side, it is better to ask and make sure. Mine was on the limp side.
Seems cook has the same problem many home holiday cooks have: getting all items out of the oven, off the stove and on the table at the same time and at a good hot temperature.
On the bright side, the coffee was very good.
Wanted this place to be so good - we try to patronize non-chain restaurants.  I am not sure this one will make it.."}
{"text":"Food is legit. It is hard to find the quality of food that we got at Cafe 99 in a \"diner/cafe\" type atmosphere. Prices were good and the dinner choices were exciting and different. We will be back to try breakfast. As a new venue, I look forward to their growth and new menu choices."}
{"text":"Couldn't eat here. Filthy washroom conditions turned us all off. And the greasy smell didn't help. This place needs some major help.  Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Found this place via Groupon and it was called Dewd Ranch, however the restaurant was called Cafe 99.  The place was deserted and we were the only patrons in the restaurant.   The decor was very very dated and did not have the slightest western \"Dewd Ranch\" flair.  Our server was great!  The food was mediocre at best.  We had a turkey sandwich which was decent.  The \"wheat\" bread looked like cheap Wonder bread.  Then there was the barbecue.....  Probably the worst ribs I have ever eaten.   They were obviously pre - cooked and partially reheated for my order.  They were lukewarm at best and very tough.  There was still coagulated fat in and on them from not being heated enough.  The side dish of beans were very bad as well.  Most likely from a can as it was hard to discern an actual legume in the dish. 

My wife used the restroom and said it was very dirty.   It appeared as if it hadn't been cleaned in a long time.  I love to patronize mom and pop restaurants, but this was really rough.   My wife did not want to go in when she saw the place and I should have listened to her.  As a result,  she says I owe her a good dinner!"}
{"text":"We ate at Cafe 99 on Sunday afternoon for lunch. The food was great and the service was amazing. The kids all said \"This place is AWESOME!\" Can't wait to try it again. Yummy"}
{"text":"We have had breakfast here twice, and it was FABULOUS!!  The biscuits and gravy are the absolute best I have ever had, and I grew up in the South.  The ham is fantastic, and the country potatoes are awesome. Since everything is cooked to order, I could get the potatoes without peppers!  Did I mention the biscuits? WOW!

The chef and staff are so friendly and the service is great.  Very welcoming atmosphere.  And the prices are so affordable!

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like the food and I like the overall vibe of the restaurant.  However, and this was a problem with the previous owners of this location, please fix the ventilation/exhaust fan in your kitchen.  You are immediately blasted by the smell of cooking grease when you walk in the front door.  You cannot eat here and leave without smelling like you showered in a deep fryer.  Now that I have that out of the way, you can really tell that they care about the quality of food here, looks like they make their own sausage patties, they use some quality ingredients, etc.  Fix the air quality issue, and I would give this place a higher rating."}
{"text":"The staff is great. The food is very hit and miss. Nothing is consistent out of the kitchen except inconsistency. Sunday/Monday breakfasts are not anything like the other 5 days.. again, due to inconsistency."}

We are glad someone is trying to make a \"go\" of this place once again. We are concerned whether or not the year-round locals are going to be able to support it.  We hope in time, they get dialed in operating this restaurant smoothly & having servers who have personally tasted everything on the menu, the chef refining his/her recipes & plating techniques, & the cooks improving their cooking techniques & expediting of orders.  The owners seem nice & concerned to have pleased customers, but they need to be more involved w/food prep, cooking, plating & serving instead of sitting in their defacto office (a rear booth).  Gordon Ramsey & Jon Staffer would have a field day if they saw that going on.  Their attempt to change the interior is a good start.  Understandably, given that it takes a lot of capital to get a restaurant up & running,  we're sure they carefully considered their priorities on the interior face-lift.  Painting the dark wood booths a light enamel & replacing the entry counter (the first thing one sees when they walk in), would have gotten them closer to a home run.  Maybe when they start running in the black, these can be done.  They need to add some greenery in the entrance planters.  The entry experience, especially the lobby, front counter & greeter  is where the \"first impression\" is made.  Hope to see it improve in a short time.   My next review will be about the food."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. I ordered a roasted garlic cheese burger, not on the menu but it should be. So garlicky and delicious. Loved every bite. Love their burgers and the southern fried biscuits and gravy. Servers are so nice. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried breakfast this time with Arizona's own SKY 12, Jerry Foster. Can't beat the $3.99 full breakfast.  Our waitress was outstanding. Reminded us of Mel's Diner. Try it you'll like it as Mikey would say."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  The prices are reasonable however the food is sub par!  I ordered over easy eggs and got over medium to over hard eggs.  Not happy!!!  Pancakes take like dirty dish cloth!!  Yuck!!!  The bacon and hashbrowns were actually very good.  Customer service was average, nothing memorable.

Won't be back!!!  Sorry, there are way too many breakfast places in the valley to choose from.  If you want to stand out, you have to do better than this.

Recommend Peoria Cafe or Brothers instead!!!"}
{"text":"I got the Groupon and was also a little confused about whether or not I was in the right parking lot, but considering this was the only restaurant at the posted address I went inside and I was at the right place. I got some brisket and sausages and the food was good. Our server was super duper friendly and kicked the pleasantness up a notch. I liked the menu selection and the prices were friendly, I'll probably come back and try it again. I got a whole lot of brisket for $10!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, the staff was very friendly and the decor was nice, but the food... Bland, nothing special, eggs were cooked incorrectly, out of the 8 we ordered 4 were over medium. French Toast had no flavor, tasted like milky bread, I could make better at home and I don't cook. Hash browns ugh, almost tasted stale. Chicken and gravy wasn't too fought, but tasted like frozen fingers fried up. Coffee not bad. And as u said service was great, I really feel bad leaving this review, but the food was no where should it be, I have no idea how this place has received 5 stars"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were excited to try this place out today. I saw so many reviews about the eggs Benedict so I decided to try them with the country potatoes. Hubby got the biscuits and gravy with a side of ham. For the eggs Benedict, you get to choose from proteins and veggies to go in the dish. I just got the ham since they didn't have the traditional Canadian bacon and with the hollandaise sauce. My breakfast was bland to say the least. My \"country\" potatoes where just diced potatoes. It would have been nice to have onions or peppers. since they are called country potatoes, I expected more. And absolutely no seasoning... No salt, no pepper.... My eggs Benedict were below average. The hollandaise sauce did not taste like anything and the ham was sliced so thinly, I could hardly tell it was in the dish and English muffin was soggy and not toasted. Now to the good part...I tasted my hubby's biscuits and gravy and was immediately envious! It was so good. So I may go back and try other menu items....seem like a hit and miss"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an afternoon snack and had the lemon cake. Mmmm. Moist, creamy, lemony. I heard they have a Pit Master on board as Chef. Can't wait to give the BBQ a try. But what I was really struck by is Jennifer and Dewey Leitch's commitment to the community. Just like the 70s decor, it is a throw back to a time when people cared about each other. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch. We ordered 5 different items before they actually had something in stock. We actually went from the breakfast menu to the dinner menu. Our daughter loved her pancakes but our food was so greasy. The decor in the recent is very dated and the bathrooms are scary!

I am revamping my review after the follow up post so that the Owner can see my comments and make aware to others-the reason why we Yelp. We went to this restaurant because it was reviewed and had good reviews, we were just surprised. We did not attend yesterday, but I did write the review yesterday because I had time to write it up. We actually went 2 weeks ago on a Saturday after all of the BBQ items were off the menu because BBQ night is Friday apparently. I would NEVER hold it against anyone for the weather conditions as we had on 9/8/14. Honestly that is ridiculous. NO ONE saw that storm coming nor did they realize what was going to happen. But that was NOT when we visited this location.  When I make a comment about the renovations, it is my opinion. I was confused by the laminated discs hanging on the wall and the blue room across, that is my opinion, and I am entitled to it. Part of being on yelp is making comments about the ambience of a room-unless I have understood that wrong. I love retro and vintage but that was not what was happening at this location. 

We will not be back. I honestly can say I did not feel that my food was \"fresh\" I had a greasy ruben that was underheated and french fries that were limp. As I stated before my daughter loved her pancake and was excited about eating it, that is why I gave 1 star. My husband had a burger and it was greasy as well and the beans he had on the side were worse than Bush's Baked Beans-or perhaps they were the same thing, he honestly could not tell and he did not finish them. 

Hopefully this 2nd review clears up any issues you have with my OPINION on YELP!"}
{"text":"So, I've gone here for three days in a row. If that's not a testament to how good the food is, then I don't know what is. The food is all fresh and never frozen, and it really effects the taste a ton! The breakfast food is great - biscuits and gravy is A+! And the dinner foods are great, classic with a modern twist. I also really love the atmosphere. It's retro without being over the top. All in all a great experience, which I will continue to enjoy!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here the second day it opened. People we're very nice. Can't say much for the food though. ... my daughter got the chicken strip kids meal and there was NO TASTE to them! Not to mention they were very large for a kids dish!! To top that off they were a over cooked! I myself got the chicken pot pie dish.. didn't like that they just threw 2 peices of corn bread for the crust.... But the stuff inside tast and looked like one of them banquit dinner boxes with the can and the stuff u put on top then place in the oven.... GROSSSS!! Everything we ordered Looked as if it eather came out a can and heated up or burnt and tastless! OH and lets not forget that my daughters orange that they just cut up and put on a plate drizzled with some orange cream suace wasn't even ripe enough to eat. Needless to say I do not see this place making it even for a place like sun city I don't see a senior eating there much!!"}
{"text":"The prices for breakfast is pretty inexpensive and they did a good job renovating the restaurant but that's where it ends. Food was mediocre at best. The eggs had zero taste and not a fan of hash browns even though they weren't as greasy as some other establishments. Coffee was good and the bacon was a thick and was the most flavorful on the plate. Service was standard. Nothing memorable. Again, it wasn't horrible, just mediocre and boring."}
{"text":"Everything's great! Food - service - can't beat it! Came for lunch and wasn't disappointed. Even our three girls enjoyed the food and the kids menus that they could color on."}
{"text":"My son and I entered this establishment on August the 20th 2014 around 7 p.m. We stood in the doorway waiting for someone to come to take our order for roughly 5 minutes. I proceeded to find someone back in the kitchen who rudely looked by me and called out for the hostess.  The hostess came and took my order and could not answer any of my questions regarding the menu.  At this time there was only one family dining in the establishment.

I ordered a turkey dinner and the barbecue brisket. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the turkey dinner was very hard with no seasoning the stuffing as well . The hostess told me the macaroni and cheese was great and made from scratch. I found the macaroni and cheese to be right out of the box..  The brisket was average in the string beans were okay. I asked where we going to receive a corn muffin or a form of a bread and she said no that they failed to make the fresh bread  that morning.  All in all this was one of the worst experiences I have had with a diner on the west side."}
{"text":"I came in this place looking for some good food with the family.   when we got there the place was almost empty except for people sitting at 2 tables.  when we sat down with my 2 kids they only had 1 kids menu and was asked to not write/draw on it for it was there very last one.  it showed they it has been like for some time cause it was like a normal paper menu that has seen better days.  the wait staff was very polite and quick.  as for the food I had the BBQ biscuits n gravy.  It came with smoked brisket, and canned gravy.  It was not too bad and the brisket had some good flavor.  The wife just mostely played with her food for she really did not care for the French toast.  The kids are at the point that they will eat anything and everything is just \"OK\" to them.   I can tell that there was not that much cleaning going on  Cause of some of the surfaces felt a little sticky.  So I would say good luck"}
{"text":"First time here and I was so glad the group of 7 that I was a part of chose this restaurant .

Everyone tried something different from the lunch menu.  The small salad and half sandwhich was amazing and only $6.50!  Burgers and BLT's with fresh cut fries were also a big hit.  Good food and reasonable prices!

I will definitely be back!  Can't wait to try breakfast here."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was horrible. Country potatoes weren't any better. Avoid this order. Staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"There was three of us and we bought two breakfasts and shared, good food and great service. I would be back."}
