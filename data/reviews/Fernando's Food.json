{"text":"Thank you Fernando's for being such an excellent food truck and for being Downtown so much. Everything I have ever had has been delicious. The prices are perfect and the service is nice and quick. Highly recommend.

Steak nachos are my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this food truck opens!! Their steak burrito is amazing and my husband really enjoyed the quessadilla. I think its better than maize!"}
{"text":"Just had these tacos a few minutes ago, the people taking orders were very nice and friendly. The tacos were THE best tacos I've had in the 5 years I have been here. The only downside is that I haven't found this taco truck sooner. Would recommend the steak tacos. I would take a picture but all that is left are empty wrappers"}
{"text":"I've visited Fernando's a few times and it's pretty good.  I've had the torta with chorizo, a steak burrito, and nachos with chorizo.  The chorizo is pretty greasy and a little overcooked, but otherwise nice and spicy.  The nacho portion was huge and definitely enough for two people.  The steak burrito was excellent!  I'll have to try it with another meat next time."}
{"text":". I used to live in Mexico City and these tacos bring me back. I've only had tacos here but I'll tell you they were so good I came back less than 24 hours later for more, and befriended the taquero. They are my favorite in town easily. My suggestion is to order campechano tacos. It's steak mixed w the chorizo, trust me on this one lol.

To the guy complaining about spending $7 on a burrito, yes, please go back to Chipotle, so you can save your precious .35 cents on fake Mexican food."}
{"text":"YUM! Awesome, authentic Mexican food.
I always get 3 steak tacos mexicano style.
Cash only and the tacos are $2 a piece! 
Can't beat the service and flavor."}
{"text":"Wow great Mexican munch food for great price. Loved the tacos and the quesadilla I ordered and their hot sauce had plenty of hot kick to it. Will come again when I'm around."}
{"text":"Great food! Service is always top notch and super friendly! Produce and tortillas are always fresh! They do not take debit/credit cards!"}
{"text":"Fernando's Food truck is downright legit. Considering a taco is $2, you can try all the options they have on the menu. I tried the chicken, pork, beef, and steak tacos all Mexican style, which is just basically cilantro and onions on top. Of those, I really enjoyed the steak, chicken, and pork, respectively. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked chicken since it is a fairly bland protein option at many places. There are also green and red hot sauces that you can get to add to your tacos. Both are good, with the green sauce being a bit spicer, but are not needed. I really look forward to coming back here to try some of their other options on the menu."}
{"text":"I usually don't do this, as a matter fact this is my first time writing a review for any place...but I would remiss if I didn't. BLOWN AWAY are words that come to mind! Best burritos and tacos in town, hands down! I experienced Fernando's about a week ago on the recommendation of a parking garage attendant (go figure). The steak burrito was phenomenal!! And the green salsa that came on the side was drinkable!! For $7 I was more than satisfied. Was this beginner's luck?? I had to find out. So, I went for the second this afternoon after trying to track them down for a few days. Lo and Behold there they were in front of Busey Bank on Neil St. This time I went for the tacos (1 steak, 1 chicken, and 1 chorizo) WOW!!! UNREAL! This place is legit! Can't wait to try the breakfast menu!!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! Hands down my new favorite place for tacos in Champaign. The chicken is spicy- so good! Perfect accompaniment to the beer at Riggs! Super friendly service too."}
{"text":"The best pork tacos I have ever had! They fully satisfied my hunger. As an added bonus, the service is efficient and incredibly friendly. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Awesome food truck! There was lots of tender, diced steak on the tacos and tortas. The torta had an amazing melted cheese crust! The salsas were a great addition. However, I wish they put a substantial amount of avocado on torta. Overall, Fernando's definitely outranks the competing food trucks."}
{"text":"Fernando's Mexican style tacos are what I go back for every time. I haven't tried anything else because they are so good. Good quality products and just the right seasoning. His two hot sauces are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos especially while having great beer at Riggs brewery.  Great selection of beer at Riggs and a great menu on the food truck."}
{"text":"Fernando's hands down has the best tacos in town. And for just $2 each!! Champaign has many great Mexican places like Wedge, Maize, Huaraches Moroleon but when it comes to tacos... I instantly think and crave Fernando's. They use really high-quality steak and ingredients. The taste is superb. I usually get everything on it, including the spicy green and red salsa. The owner Eric is also a really cool friendly guy!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I'm really happy I stopped here today.  I'm from California and grew up eating at taco trucks.  This one is the closest to that taste that I've ever had here.  The tortillas were soft and earthy, the lengua was tender and delicious.  They say they're going to have cabeza soon, and that will make them the only place in town to get it!"}
{"text":"Popped by Fernando's while seeing a show at Cowboy Monkey. Had a craving for a quick bite so I got a steak taco. While stooped on the curb while eating tacos, the person working came out of the truck to give us extra napkins and free bottles of water. He even gave a free bottle of water to our friend who had purchased her tacos from the truck next door (not sure if there's any affiliation). We were so grateful and appreciative for the extra kindness! And now here I am, nearly two weeks later still thinking about that steak taco and making moves to get over there for lunch right now. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of my favorite tacos in town. I tried them for the firat time a few days ago and almost cried it was so good. I got their chicken tacos (mexican style, they also have the option of american style) and my spouse got their breakfast burrito (it was HUGE, and super delicious). They are cash only, so come prepared. They're prices are ridiculously reasonable (it's on $2 for a taco, AMAZING!) and the staff is super friendly, a definite plus. GO CHECK THEM OUT!"}
{"text":"BEST TWO DOLLARS YOU WILL EVER SPEND ON FOOD! They are so well seasoned, and they give a lot of food for your dollars. I wish they were open all day long and took credit/debit - I would have it everyday. The nachos are delicious too! I love their food, best Mexican food in Champaign!"}
{"text":"Fernando's is outstanding in every way, I love the chicken tacos with spicy salsa.  My buddy usually gets the steak quesadilla and says there is no way he would consider getting anything else because it is so good and so much food!  Thank you Fernando's"}
{"text":"Always comes in the clutch on that late inebriated evening when the ethanol in your system metabolizes and warps your body into taco withdrawal. Fernando's accepts the challenge and provides much needed detox in the form of tortas, burritos, nachos, and mouthwatering tacos. Riggs is always twice as tempting when Fernando's is in the vicinity."}
{"text":"The ground beef nachos are amazing. The tacos are also really, really good. I've had almost everything on the menu more than a few times. It's always been fresh, hot, and tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yeah, these are my favorite tacos in town for sure.  Even compared to Maize.  The fact that they park outside Rigg's Friday and Saturday doesn't hurt.  I ate Fernando's tacos for the first time and then was counting down the days till I could justify getting them again.  

The sauces are good, the meat is so flavorful.  Steak is my fav."}
{"text":"If you are partying or drinking late night in downtown Champaign and crave for some delicious food, Fernando's food truck is the best answer! They are open late night even after bars close so it's best place to get drunk food. The service is very quick and prompt. The quesadilla and nachos are excellent. Their menu is very limited (only 5 items) but every item on the menu is very tasty. The only negative side about this food truck is this is a cash only food truck so please carry some cash to have tasty food. Since this is a popular food truck, sometimes they ran out of their popular food item but definitely try the other items and you will be satisfied. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best AUTHENTIC tacos in Champaign!!! Just wish you guys would come on campus more often!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I am glad that I decided to stop by and try it out after driving by this truck everyday. At first I was a little sad that it didn't come with chips but the quality of the taco completely made up for it."}
{"text":"Fernando's isn't always easy to find but it's one of the food trucks that I'll always stop for when I see it around. The two words I associate with Fernando's are authentic and fresh. I love being able to get tacos de lengua (tongue) and other items that you don't usually see around town. 

The proprietor is friendly and service is quick as you'd expect. The sauces he makes are awesome, although you may want to be careful to choose one that doesn't exceed your heat tolerance-some are pretty dang hot!"}
{"text":"Delish tacos and the nachos are amazing! I get Fernandos every time im downtown from a long night of drinking. The tacos: very tender and full of flava  the nachos: by far my favorite place to get nachos, ANYWHERE. Well worth $8. They are generous with every ingredient that comes with them. Make sure to stop by here!"}
{"text":"I've had the steak tacos and the chicken tacos and they're both really good but the chicken tacos are pretty spicy.  I only gave 4 stars bc they have no mild sauce.  The mild sauce I was given was spicier than the hot sauce."}
{"text":"I love Fernando's! They have some of the best Mexican tacos around....would highly recommend if you're downtown."}
{"text":"This is my favorite food truck here in downtown champaign, it is not easy to find; they're out mostly at night on a weekend. Their steak tacos are really good!  it is not dry and it's tasty! If you want to try some authentic Mexican tacos from a truck, this is definitely your best choice!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Fernando's a second try last weekend after leaving one of the campus bars.

This time I opted for a steak burrito.

I was a little disappointed that they didn't have or were out of pastor/pork, I really liked my pork taco last time I was in.

This time was a little better, the burrito was better than the taco I got last time. The steak on this burrito was actually steak, and not ground beef, so that was an improvement.

Unfortunately the burrito comes at a cost of $7. I think this is too expensive. For $7 I think I could get not only more food, but better quality food at Chipotle or for even less money, Maize.

Not bad."}
{"text":"I don't know where this food truck frequents, but my boyfriend brought me some during the late night hours and it blows Burrito King out of the water!  Don't get me wrong, Burrito King is good during the day but quality drops significantly during late hours (they probably think drunk students can't tell the difference).  The tacos were very fresh and the meat was flavorful.  Once I can find where it is, I'd definitely order again."}
{"text":"I heard so many positive reviews about this food truck that I took it upon myself to find this truck. I called them over the phone and asked if they were open, and they sent me the address. In the middle of a snow storm I went on a 25 min mission to track this truck down. 2 minutes away from the truck I seen a car fall in a ditch and I freaked out and turned around and went to burrito king. As I ate my food I was still wondering what I was missing out by not going to Fernando's. Later on, I went downtown to have some drinks and eat dinner. To my surprise I seen the truck parked on Main Street and I was in shock. I just had to have it. I abandoned the thought of sitting down for dinner and ordered from this truck. I must say the best decision I have made. The gentleman were so nice, and the food is super tasty. I am in love. I will always choose this truck over any taco places in Champaign. A must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing quesadillas and nachos. They are always there when you need them (like after the bars close, yay!) Delicious food, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Simple snack outside of Merry Anns! Good for when you are out late in downtown Champaign. I tried the chicken taco! It's pulled chicken which I am not fond of, but the taste is good! The salsas are also tasty, which is super important for when I am eating Mexican cuisine. Friendly staff working the truck as well. Definitely a better choice when it comes to a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Fernando's tacos are SOOO good. Trust me I've been to every Mexican restaurant in town and have never been able to find my one of kind tacos. I have to go all the way to Chicago to get them. If you want tacos that are packed with FLAVOR and that are juicy... these are your tacos. The staff are friendly too! They are so nice! I've been on the search for awesome/authentic/flavorful tacos and I finally found it. I wish they opened a restaurant or taqueria cuz' I would be there 24/7 lol!"}
