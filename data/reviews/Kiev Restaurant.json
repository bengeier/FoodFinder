{"text":"I was invited to Kiev for a  banquet on a Sunday afternoon, and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was top notch, which, when it comes to Russian cuisine, means that it was not hopelessly over salted or oozing with grease.  I actually quite enjoyed most of the dishes I tried.

The decor is horrendous with the banquet hall chair covers  pompously hanging over beat up chairs, and equally pompous synthetic linen.  The service is like it was in the 80s in Russia: insincere and clueless.  I was quite happy that there was no music -- I could actually enjoy a conversation.

I'd return there for the food."}
{"text":"An unexpected jem I found while passing by and decided to check it out.  Since I am Ukrainian I was interested in their perogies from the start.  The staff kindly brewed a fresh coffee right before my eyes which was a nice touch.  Before ordering the perogies I might add that I had asked her how many and how big they were considering I was paying around $7.00 for one serving, which was a little steep if you ask me.  Well she said it would be average size and I believed it until I opened it up later to find that infact they were HALF the size of any perogy I have ever seen in my life and 3x more greasy!  I am shocked, and insulted as a Ukrainian myself and growing up with the food this was a poor excuse.  The whole place was tacky and an attempt wad made to appear fancy but that was a genuine fail. I'm actually sorry to write this but its true."}
{"text":"Tried several things:
Kharcho was bad, did not taste like the real thing.
Cabbage stew was horrendous. Bad, bad, bad!
Water was no good.
Fried potatoes also no good.

Beef stroganoff was good."}
