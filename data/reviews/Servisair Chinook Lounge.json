{"text":"This has got to be one of the worst lounges that I've been to. This is also the only one I've been to where they ask for your flight number and ID. I'm an airline crew, and no other lounge asks me for this info. I also have the AMEX platinum card and wanted to bring my 2 companions with me. The grouchy old lady at the reception counter said that I was only allowed to bring in one guest. It must only apply to this lounge, because I haven't had a problem bringing in 2 guests with my platinum card to other lounges. This lounge also does not offer any hot meals. The only thing that comes close is stale 2 day old soup. The snack and drink selection is really poor. Honestly, unless you can get in for free with a pass or voucher, don't bother with this place. It's the worst lounge in Canada. Considering Calgary is a busy airport, this is really sad that they can't invest in a better lounge with nicer polite staff."}
{"text":"With Calgary being one of the busiest airports in canada, I can't believe they close at 9pm. I recommend the aircanada lounge or any of the Plaza lounges over this. No hot food, grouchy staff do not make up for the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place could be soo good but this is what you get. It's sad. It's \"A\" side and services Westjet travellers and BA guests. Next time I will pass and spend my cash for a Subway sandwich"}
{"text":"One of worst lounges I've been to in Canada... (AC and \"premium\" included). They offer chips and pretzels and peanuts...and that's about it. A few stale finger sandwiches, a few (count them 3) deserts. Only hot item is a sad looking ministrone. Booze choices are also limited to the basics. Only beer choice was 4 bottles of Coors light. When asked about other beer choices the staff replied that they are \"doing inventory counts...sorry\". I wasn't sure what exactly they had to count (it couldn't take long!). I guess if you have a free pass its no big deal but I would take any hard earned cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here as part of priority pass and was flying Westjet, so it is in the Westjet terminal . Food is mediocre at best but they have good beers on taps that you can pour yourself. They had vegetables, which is something that I haven't seen in most other lounges. The lounge is very open and wide so there is a lot of room. It was free for me as part of the pass but I would not pay for it otherwise."}
{"text":"This airport lounge has gone DOWN HILL!!!  Today was the worst I've ever seen it. I come here because it's free with my frequent flyer status ...don't pay! This lounge has never been great (Edmonton's is hands down better!). Today at my visit here, the place is filthy. There's about 3 clean glasses available. They took away the small chip bags and peanuts. Now they have an open bowl of chips! Like no thanks...disgusting! Old tuna wraps, Beringer and apothic wine (pretty cheap brands) and coors light. This is terrible! Come on YYC airport, step it up...this is embarrassing."}
{"text":"Back in the day this place was YYC's best kept secret. Sad to say this is no longer the case. Over the last few months they have replaced the bottled beer with a kegerator (foam party). There used to be Ms Vickies  chips and peanuts in individual packaging but now they serve chips/peanuts out of a bowl ( Call the food police). I have witnessed people grab handfuls without using tongs. The food selection looks like it's past it's prime and ready for the garbage (dry sandwiches and vegetables). No hot food beside the soup. Super dry cinamon and croissants to boot ! DONT PAY TO GO HERE, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!! Read the comment book there before you pay, its full of similar reviews."}
{"text":"Although this lounge is spacious and normally quiet, the food selection is very limited and below expectations. It's a nice place to enjoy a coffee or mixed drink, but otherwise not worth paying for."}
{"text":"Just checked into Chinook Lpunge concourse A and gosh what a giant waste of money! The food selection is awful and everything looks old. I grabbed a chicken wrap which inexplicably had no chicken in it. While checking in the concierge was on the phone with her manager begging for a break because she had been working for 4 hours and there were only 2 people on staff - on a Friday! The manager said no. This lounge appears to be the most horribly mismanaged lounge I've ever been to. The space is beautiful. But the food is awful."}
{"text":"Ouch - this place is just awful. The way some of the food is out (chips and nuts) seems totally unsanitary. The giant tongs they have there aren't appropriate so I've witnessed many people shove their hands in to serve themselves, couldn't you just get some small bags to set out? Long line for checkin the morning I was there while a second agent was talking on their cell phone phone, and the food options are very limited. No soup or warm food to be found anywhere and they were very low on other foods. Nothing like the Maple Leaf Lounge that I have been to in YYC. I wouldn't pay for this."}
{"text":"One of the best airport lounges in Canada.   This lounge is a quiet haven offering snacks, soaps, fruit, cheese an veggies.  Much more than the Maple Leaf Lounge. Worth a try, I get in with my American Express Platinum card."}
{"text":"If you are flying WestJet, or another airline that uses concourse D, into Calgary and have a longer than wanted layover. Check to see if one of your credit cards gives you access to the Servisair Chinook Lounge. Sandwiches, pop, water, juice, assorted alcoholic options, cereal and comfortable chairs. Also, many of the seats along the windows have plugins to charge your phones, iPads and laptops.  It is a nice relaxing break between flights.  If you don't happen to have a qualifying credit card, admission is only $30. A little pricey, but when you have a lot of flying and a lot of waiting it really helps make the overall experience that much better."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst lounge I've ever been to, in terms of food selection. Luckily, I used a free pass for the lounge, otherwise I would have asked for a refund. The food is subpar, the sandwiches and wraps did not look fresh and options are limited. There is no hot food, which I knew. However, the website said there was soup, but I didn't see any. The only good thing is if you want to go and drink alcohol, which I wasn't looking for. The lounge itself is ok, it is quiet and spacious. Washrooms were dirty, not sure how often it is serviced."}
{"text":"No hot food. Pre-made cold cut sandwiches.   The lounge seemed hot and stuffy.    Probably the worst lounges I have been to."}
{"text":"This is a subpar lounge. The woman who checked me in wasn't \"speaking\" she was grumbling, I could barely hear her. She didn't smile either.  The food is bland... you have sandwiches, a soup and bagels, toasts etc.  I tried to pour a draft beer... well it sprayed all over me. The staff saw this and I received no apologies.  I got in for \"free\" with my credit card. There's no way I would pay for this.  On the plus side, you have a nice view of the tarmac."}
