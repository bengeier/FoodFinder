{"text":"I am so so so happy to see this restaurant has expanded and opened in Medina!  While visiting family over the Holidays, I noticed this delicious sushi place would be opening soon....I was thrilled! My family did not seem to understand where all my excitement was stemming from.  As I began to tell them how SOTR and I go way back, they were intrigued.  

While living in Bath, prior to moving to the West Coast, I found this hidden gem in a very small corporate deli set-up like place.  I didn't care what the atmosphere or decor was like since the sushi is amazing and they always offered buy two rolls get one free coupons!  Who needs all that fluff anyways?  Then, one day at work, SOTR was at my prior place of employment rolling sushi made-to-order!  I could not believe it...sushi from SOTR whenever I wanted.

Living in California has opened my eyes to many many sushi restaurants.  It's kind of like Starbucks in any major city...sushi restaurants are everywhere, and I have been to quite a few.  It doesn't matter what the price, atmosphere, or ambiance bode as long as the sushi is fresh and makes you want to come back for more.  That is the feeling you get when you leave SOTR.  Everything is so fresh, relatively affordable compared to the two other sushi places in the entire area, and their customer service is impeccable.  Another huge plus is that it is not a chain restaurant, which seems to be more than the norm and hardly divergent of Medina restaurant seekers.

I have been a fan on FB and bought the groupon they are offering today for when I come for another visit. Buy it!!! You will not be disappointed.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and we're self-appointed sushi aficionados, so we decided to go.
I wasn't quite sure what to expect when we arrived at Sushi on the Roll in Medina. I had envisioned some incarnation of the trending dark-lit rooms filled with faux bamboo, tiny green tea cups with uber ornate designs, a splattering of greenery maybe. Perhaps a tank with depressed-looking fish that wondered if they're kin suffered before ending up in a sarcophagus of rice and eel sauce.

I have to humbly say that I've never been more off-base (as it pertains to guessing the ambiance of a sushi establishment). I actually thought we were in the wrong place at first. Minimalism is kind of an understatement. If you ever went into the old Metro Burger (RIP), then you have some idea of the ambiance ... but literally 6 times bigger. Brightly lit with both natural and human-induced light. A concrete floor a la VegiTerranean (RIP) ran the expanse of the single room setup. \"Surely, that can't expect us to order sushi from a counter like some hospital lunch-line!\"
That being said, once I shifted gears and understood that this is probably exactly how the real deal sushi places in big cities (ie, Tokyo) approach their ambiance and delivery, I totally dug it! In my mind, I even down-graded the ambiance those stuffy over-produced sushi places a bit. I really like the idea that I can eat sushi in a more vibrant environment and not have to fight off the sleep that comes from dining under 5-watt bulbs - why should a sushi outing have a minimum requisite of 1.5 hours?!

As an added bonus, the sushi was delicious! Owner Ken Oppenheimer was nice enough to have a chat with us. While most restaurants use tuna mashed up and blended with an assortment of sauces for their Spicy Tuna rolls, he explained that he insists on using strips to tuna sashimi instead so that the quality and flavor of the tuna is preserved. And it is.
To get a better idea of what I'm talking about, just go and do. You'll be refreshed by your new sushi paradigm."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Happy to have another sushi joint in Medina, outside of House of Hunan and the prepacked trays available at Giant Eagle and Buehler's.  Agree with Jay C.'s comments -- it rates 3 stars.  Not a great value considering that you're busing your own table and eating with plastic utensils.  Our lunch for four cost easily $50 (and that was with two kids).  The sushi itself was decent, but this isn't Sakura in Fairlawn or Shukei in Beachwood.  It is average at best.  I even passed up a groupon deal that offered $30 worth of sushi for $15, b/c even then, I didn't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Could be better.  Three out of five stars was the very best I could give it.
When you walk in, the decor isn't bad - imagine a more spacious version of a Chipotle restaurant combined with a Taco Bell self-serve soda fountain, a lot of tables and some couches here and there.  You'll have plenty of time to soak in the scenery while waiting for your order.

Pros: The sushi was fresh; definitely no pre-rolled or refrigerated items here.  Everything tasted sufficiently fine, though none of it is going to win culinary awards outside of the area or be sought out far and wide by sushi connoisseurs.

Cons: After the four of us decided on a couple of items each, the bill totaled $91.  Not horrible for sushi, but not exactly inexpensive.  Remember, nobody waits your table or brings you drinks, and your forks are plastic.  There were only two other tables with people at them, but our food still took 22 minutes to bring out.  Then they forgot an item we had ordered.  But instead of apologizing, they said \"well it was way down here at the bottom of the receipt\".  So?  Do you think that would fly at even McDonald's?  I think most customers are accustomed to getting all of the food they order. 

Once you've carried your own meals, drinks and soy sauce to your table, you will find the experience rather austere instead of festive.  I suspect that those who report having the time of their life in this place can be explained more by the company they brought with them, or just the fact that sometimes going out for sushi is, in of itself, its own reward.  

Objectively speaking, this place holds no advantage over any other sushi place in the area.  My personal sushi-divining-rods point toward a buffet in nearby Montrose which boasts all you can eat sushi for $15 per person.  Waiters and silverware are included!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a place with good sushi and teriyaki. Now I've found it. Mind, it's not the \"best\" I've ever had but the convenience is perfect, price good, atmosphere good. I had a cali roll and a rice bowl with chicken and teriyaki. The veggies in the bowl were perfect crisp tender. The chicken was good if slightly bland. I thought it needed a good sear on it. My only complaint is it felt that it took a little to long for our food to be ready. I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We were excited to eat here, and liked what they have done with the space.  While there are a number of strong reviews we found the food pretty mediocre.  My sashimi was cut thinly instead of in a block, which I found made it get to room temperature too quickly.  Luckily I started with the smoked salmon, which was quite good.  But the tuna and yellowtail were not good at all.  I couldn't even finish the yellowtail.  I am not sure if this was because of low quality fish or that it was not fresh enough.  I also had a salmon roll that was just OK.

My wife had a chicken bowl with rice that was OK.  We can get something similar with better vegetables and chicken at one of our local Chinese take-outs - Asian Grill.  She also got a chicken roll that was a bit overpowered by the cream cheese, and had under ripe, hard avocado.

We were attracted by a $30 for $15 Groupon, but probably would not go back."}
{"text":"What an elegant idea turned awry with a lack-luster execution. There are some nicer appointments in this open and airy establishment coupled with a predominantly cold and hard interior. For a place that is selling itself as Japanese food fast, the hired help felt slower than that of a three toed sloth on a hot day in Africa. Overpriced drinks coupled with only so-so sushi (this is the Midwest), left me feeling like something was missing. Perhaps throwing a hibachi in the mix or a ninja that has no remorse for apathetic culinary offerings, would elevate this rice peddling pagoda's standards to something other than mediocrity.


***Follow Up***
 I got this email from the owner - proof this institution is not trying to accept constructive criticism. 

\"Dude, you need a job.  Your gay verbiage makes me wanna throw up.. Sure is easy to judge other people when you don't have the sack to do something like this yourself.\"

Gay bash much? Hate much? Step up your game! By the way, I have a wonderful job and a \"sack\"."}
{"text":"OK, so I haven't seen the unfriendly cashier since that one visit, but more importantly, they have SPECIALS now!  For lunch, you can get two rolls and a drink for $10, which is awesome.  They have happy hour specials during the week, too.  Check their website for specifics.  My consistent favorites are the Chicken Roll and (still) the Tempura Asparagus.  My husband's a big fan of the Chaz roll.
My only suggestion for them: please provide a larger bussing container next to the trash cans.  It can be hard to put my plates/tray there when there's already others in the way.
I really like what they're doing here.  Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"Back in Minneapolis there used to be a food reviewer who would write glowingly about the food and then criticize the design of the wall sconces!! I have tried not to be that person. Other than messy bathrooms, I have never been put off by an occasional lapse in d√©cor. If the food and service are good, or even great, I am a fan. Sushi on the Roll, unfortunately, is a fairly new restaurant in a space that is overly large, sparsely filled with tables and no seeming \"flow\" to the lay out. The large amount of unused space is distracting, and either some partitions or floor to ceiling fabric treatments could help create a more intimate feeling.
We went at lunch, and my \"bowl\" of fried rice, shrimp, and a vegetable mix was very good. I sampled the shrimp roll & \"Chaz\" roll of a coworker and they were very good as well. The service is good, if not a bit confusing, as the signage says that you pick up your order \"here\", but they seem to hand deliver all orders to the table. Very friendly staff, and were great at helping us figure out the menu. I will be back to try again in the evening, and they have a \"happy hour\" option with sushi at $5.00 and 1/2 priced drinks."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place one evening with my 7 year old daughter who likes sushi.  I've been eating sushi for 12 years and this was by far the worst sushi restaurant I've ever been in. Fast food sushi is not a good idea. The cuts were thin and tasted not fresh. Plus we waited a long time for the food to arrive and the place was virtually empty.

For the prices they're charging, plastic forks and self service drinks, soy sauce and other needs is ridiculous.  Save yourself the bad experience and go visit a real sushi restaurant with servers and real silverware. 

The decor felt like a doctors office. A sushi restaurant should feel intimate, not like I'm sitting in a McDonalds."}
{"text":"Guess it was my fault for ordering duck wings from a sushi truck, but, still didn't mean I should get sick from them. Buried in sauce, not even that tasty. Got sick an hour later. Went back and told the people on the truck who gave a very casual \"sorry to hear\". Would not eat from this truck again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear Medina had another sushi restaurant coming because I really am not a fan of the one other place I know that is nearby. My friends and I always decide to get carry out because the atmosphere isn't something we find worth staying for when we can head to one of our homes and open a bottle of wine. Nothing really big to complain about there, though. I have ordered out there a total of 5 or 6 times now, usually enough sushi to feed 3 people. The sushi is always full of fish and not overwhelmed with rice, and it always tastes fresh. As for the recipe and preparation, nothing to complain about there, either.

Here is where my complaint comes. The first time I got carryout there were no sauces in the bag (sushi sauce, spicy mayo, etc..) that would normally come ON the rolls if I were dining in. So the second time I checked the bag and they weren't in there so I asked before I left. I have had to ask for the sauces more often than I haven't. I have ordered rolls twice that specifically come with fish roe and haven't gotten the fish roe either time. I have now learned that I not only need to look inside for the sauces, but now I need to specifically check for fish roe as well.

Last time I came in with a friend to order carryout they were out of rice. The man at the counter said they had gotten a huge rush due to the new specials and it would be about 30 minutes before sushi rice would be done. Not a big deal at all for us at the time, but after we ordered and planned to come back for it, my friend pointed out a simple \"sorry\" would have been nice in addition to the explanation. When we came back 40 minutes later for the sushi, the girl at the counter couldn't find an order for us and the woman making the sushi just shrugged her shoulders and kind of rolled her eyes. The young lady found our ticket still on the printer, nobody had noticed it once the rice was done, I guess!? So we took a seat to wait for the sushi for another 15 minutes. The woman who had previously seemed annoyed that we came in for the sushi we ordered 30 minutes earlier came over to us and dropped off our sushi without a word. No apology, no smile, no \"thanks for waiting, have a good day\". Nothing. My friend said she would have expected something for free because of the extremely long wait, but all I would have liked was good customer service. Things happen and if business is higher than expected and I have to wait 30 minutes for sushi, no big deal. Just apologize for the inconvenience and I'll patiently wait.

So overall, the employees need to be more careful making sure carryout orders get everything they should and they should make an effort to be a bit friendlier and hospitable. Otherwise, the product is wonderful."}
{"text":"OMG! Beware.. very scary New York Roll. Ordered take-out for lunch they forgot ginger and soy sauce in container. Salmon very suspect looking and warm tasting. I ate one piece and was to afraid to eat another piece tossed 9 pieces out terrible waste of time and $$ Asian crab salad used to be my favorite now could not eat but three bites. Too bad was a really nice alternative for lunch. won't go back..."}
{"text":"We ate here with a Groupon. Tuna roll was just okay but King crab roll was great. Family is not a sushi eater like me so they got fried rice and noodle dishes. The chicken fried rice with garlic sauce was really tasty. Kind of a neat, open casual vibe."}
{"text":"SOTR, you've been demoted.  

It seems that every time we patron this restaurant, the food gets a little more sad.  We went again last Friday and ordered to go.  We spent over $80 between us and another couple, and this was with a Groupon.  

I'm disappointed that my favorite squid salad is no longer available, and equally as sad that the appearance of our food looked better with an Instagram filter than it did on our plate.  The yellowtail sashimi is no longer big and vibrant - it was roughly cut and looked suspicious.  I took a picture, just in case we got sick.  

I was a champion for this place when it first opened, but now find myself underwhelmed by each visit.  Plus, when you buy a coupon online, you have to spend a minimum of $40 to redeem it.  I would rather spend that money at House of Hunan, where I know the food is consistent.

Sorry, SOTR.  Step up your game or get off the field."}
{"text":"This is new-ish large self-serve sushi restaurant. Their sushi was very tasty (I ordered an eel roll and a spicy tuna roll) but found their noodle bowl (beef with teriyaki sauce) to be lacking. I specifically ordered it without celery but the cook put it in anyway. Amazingly enough, the young man who cooked my noodles was the same person who took my order as well. So young, yet lacking a bit of short term memory.

Everything was self serve, from drinks to utensils, etc., just like a fast food restaurant. This establishment was nicely decorated, it had a couple of televisions, and a nice waiting area with big chairs and sofa. 

They also teach sushi making classes here from what I read on their table tents. Also, they have lunch/daily specials which I believe is good value for the money.

I wouldn't hesitate to visit this place again for their sushi."}
{"text":"It used to be really good, what happened? The menu recently changed and not in a good way. 

The staff works so slowly that getting two rolls out takes about a half hour. Seriously."}
{"text":"I love the Crab, Shrimp or Salmon Rangoon 
crab stick/shrimp/salmon, cream cheese, scallion,
avocado, spicy mayonnaise, panko tempura battered and the edamame!! everything is super fresh..some of the best sushi in the Akron/Canton/Fairlawn area"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, decent atmosphere.  Prices are similar to any sit down sushi bar but here you eat with plastic forks and fetch your own drinks."}
