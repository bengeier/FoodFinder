{"text":"Open for only two weeks.  Totally new operators (Previous attempts were not very good). My green chicken curry was the best I've had (I'm a green chicken curry nut). My wife enjoyed the cashew chicken. The seasoning for both were done by a professional. Service was quick and very friendly. Hard to get to, as it's behind the Jack in the Box on the main drag. They don't expect to get their beer and wine license for another week, but try their hot green tea!  We certainly will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh rolls, beef noodle soup, and papaya salad. Large portions, and the service is so friendly! Working my way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"WOW. I tried this based on the recommendation of a friend obsessed with Thai food possibly more than me. Prompt, friendly service and some of the best Thai food I've ever had.  The beef salad was perfectly sour, salty, sweet and spicy. The shrimp was tender and the veggies in my pad vegetables had a nice bite to them. My picky mom ordered the pad eggplant special and she loved it - I did too. My son ordered fried rice w/beef and I didn't expect much, but it was actually really good.  Their Lao-style papaya salad is one of the best I've ever had.  This will definitely be a regular go-to place for Thai."}
{"text":"The food is delightful and everytime we go, we feel welcome! Great service, very friendly and inviting staff...a family run business, with attention to detail and customer service!! The Thai ice tea with coconut milk is amazing...the Tom Kai soup is to die for and of course you can't go wrong with Pad Thai...two star is already pretty spicy though...  Fried veggies are really yummy too...everything we try has the authentic flavor we crave when we go out to Esaan Thai :-)"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find great food just behind jackinabox In little Phoenix. Excellent fast service and healthy choices...who could ask for more!"}
{"text":"I heard about this cafe on a facebook group that has been really plugging this establishment. I am very pleased. The food was excellent and the service pleasant. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and clean surroundings. I reccomended this thai for a quick and authentic meal."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai ive had in southern Oregon.  Egg rolls were pretty good.  Good serviLooking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Best Thai food around, and the service is great too."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some food while passing through and was very impressed. Flavors were great."}
{"text":"My second favorite Thai dinning experience ever! How the hell did I overlook this place? Atmosphere, 5 star, Cleanliness, 5 star, staff attitude, 5 star, beverages, 5 star, menu selection, 5 star, authenticity, 5 star, value, 5 star. My only word of caution......I like it spicy! Like when you order spicy in Thailand.....I was surprised. This is my kinda spicy. When she asked how spicy, I said very spicy. I got what I asked for. Just beware! These ladies know and serve authentic Thai food. So good! I have a feeling this won't stay s secret for long!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly quick service. Fresh veggies. A lot of the dishes are a little too sweet, but the flavors are really nice. Good rice."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. Excellent flavorful Thai food. Especially love their gravies, curries and sauces. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Not good. It was fine for being In a pinch, but I'm pretty sure the pho broth was not real bone broth. Very salty and doctored with far too much onion and garlic. Also, leftovers never got gelatinous when I chilled them. Was really hoping for some good eats in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is dang good! Not too long of a wait and my dish was piping hot. I feel lucky this place is right across the street from work."}
{"text":"This was a pleasantly delicious surprise.  I wasn't expecting greatness but what I found far surpassed greatness, for sure.  Being vegan, it is tricky to find a great Thai restaurant which will also make vegan meals. This one does both, friendly and eagerly so.  I highly recommend this place.  I will return !"}
{"text":"Best Thai in town and they are incredibly consistent.  Really fresh food, bright flavors, and great service.  We prefer a thicker red curry than they typically serve.  I figured it couldn't hurt to ask them to make it thicker, so I did.  Now every time we come in and order, the server asks us if we'd like it thick.  If I could give them a 6th star I would."}
{"text":"This place is the best Thai food I have ever had.  The food and service are amazing. Prices are reasonable for Thai cuisine.  Essan is truly a jewel in the Rogue Valley.  Go!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the reviews are SPOT ON!! This place is GOOD!  Pad See Ew ~ YUM (they have all of the proper condiments for it too) Cashew Gai ~ YUM (veggies SUPER fresh and have perfect crunch) House salad was very simple and not my favorite, but who cares.... Thai Iced Tea was made just right~ and the allow for coconut milk instead of half & half!!   Service was great, kitchen crew were Thai and lovely!  We have been all over Thailand and eat Thai everywhere we go and this place is definitely getting a bookmark."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best yellow curries I've ever had. I travel for employ and eat Thai almost everywhere I go. This was a treat!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for some pad Thai and egg rolls. Good food, generous portions. We had great service and the place was very clean.   Can't ask for much more. It was also super affordable."}
{"text":"I have to admit, my expectations for this place were pretty low due to the fact that the last couple places in this spot were not good. It's good to know location does not mean food has to be bad, because the food at Esaan is not bad at all. I have been three times and tried three different dishes. The first time I had the Pad Woon Sen and it was pretty good. The second time I had the Pad Thai and I did not like it. It tastes like it has tomato paste (or ketchup?) in it. I know some places do their Pad Thai like this, but I do not care for the flavor. The third time I had the Pad Se Ew and it was the best thing I've had so far. I also tried the shrimp rolls and they were pretty good -- kind of like a combination between crab rangoon and spring rolls. The best impression this place left on me is how incredibly nice the staff are. I got my food to-go every time and they were friendly from the get go, got my food cooked quick, gave me iced water to drink while waiting, and were super gracious the whole time. I really hope they are able to stay in business!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat! My roomate always puts in orders to go and they are ready for us in at least 15 minutes. The pad Thai is always yummy and the pineapple fried rice is sooooo good. Makes for a good lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Great find! Wonderful pad Thai and mango curry dinner. Very friendly staff. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Really can't reconcile the hype with the reality regarding this place. We live in Phoenix and have eaten at all of the other iterations of this place, so we were hoping, based on all the positive reviews, that this new attempt would fare better than the previous several failures. I can only say that it is a slight improvement and that's it. This is nothing to get excited about (and btw, \"best Thai food in the Rogue Valley\" isn't saying much to begin with.) on that note, their new sign reads \"EXOTIC FOOD.\" Maybe someone needs to fill them in that Thai food hasn't been considered exotic in this country since circa 1978. The green curry was the worst I have ever had - the eggplant was practically raw, the sauce was like water, and the chicken was dry. The Pad Thai was ok - a bit syrupy sweet, but the shrimp were at least cooked properly. The red curry was a bit better but sauce still way too thin. We have tried this place three times to be sure, and the food just isn't very good. I'm sad to have to say this because I really had high hopes. I could care less about the service if the food isn't good, which it isn't. Unless you have absolutely no idea what Thai food is supposed to be like (i.e. You have never eaten Thai food outside of the Rogue Valley) in which case you might think it's awesome. Who knows?! :) If you want truly delicious Thai food, travel a bit further south to Talent and eat at Bangkok Atchara. It's the ONLY decent Thai food I have found here so far, and it compares to some of the best I have had in SF."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Tasty and fresh. Staff was attentive. A wonderful dining experience! We will be back."}
{"text":"Cold day and we were craving Pho but none to be found in Medford then we found Essan Café. Very clean warm atmosphere and friendly staff. We had the beef Pho and chicken Pho which were great. We also had the fresh spring rolls which were large and tasty with the peanut sause and sweet sause.  We will diffentley make the drive from Rogue River to experience the other Thai dishes which looked awesome in the Menu. Until next time."}
{"text":"My go-to for Thai.   The fresh rolls are amazing, thai iced tea is perfect, and the curries are YUM! I usually judge a Thai place by their pad thai because it has been my experience that most pad thai smells fishy; therefore, making it not very appetizing to eat. But not theirs! It's one of the better pad thai's I have tried and I come from a highly cultured city where good eats were abundant."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The sauces had good flavor profiles and the entries had variety in flavor. We got pad Thai and the noodles were cooked just right and the beef was lesser cut but cooked well. We also go the veggies with shrimp and it was perfect. We also got the pork fried rice and asked for it spicy. It was a solid 5-6/10 on the spicy scale but it was good. The server was quite nice to our kids. We will go back."}
{"text":"They do a good job here. The menu is good, the food fresh, nice sized portions and really delicious. I discovered it about 5 days ago and have been back twice. I love the rice paper wrapped fresh vegetable rolls with chili and peanut sauce. I ordered them both times. The Pad Thai was good my husband really liked it and I had a delish yellow curry.  This will be one of my go to places."}
{"text":"service was good, waitress was nice, but food was mediocre compared to other Thai places.. like fast food Thai.. worth half what they're charging."}
{"text":"Fresh, perfectly cooked and supper tasty. Stopped for a nice lunch and even with a small crowd the service was fast and friendly.  When the description of the Eggplant w/ basil said \"fresh Basil\" they mean like cut straight from a plant... Wonderful food. I will be back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the atmosphere was trendy yet cozy; however, I was looking for authentic fresh Thai food and did not find it here. I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with beef. The sauce tasted closer to sweet and sour than peanut sauce. In fact, it didn't taste like peanut sauce at all. Very little beef came with it. My husband ordered the Beef Pho soup. It came with flavorless beef balls & few pieces of thinly sliced beef. Otherwise the Pho was average with a savory broth, fresh veggies, and nice thin noodles. I give them a 3 for the Pho combined with the service, but the Pad Thai was a zero."}
{"text":"This is a great local Thai place, not much in Phoenix  area so it's nice to have some good diverse food. The waitress is always nice."}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem! I'm a huge Thai food lover and coming from SF this is a home away from home! The food was wonderful and the service delightful! This is my go to for Thai food in the valley!"}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Thai restaurant in Medford area!! The owners are unbelievably sweet and food is out of this world. Mmmm brings me back to all of my travels and wonderful food. Their soups are amazing and noodle dishes all are delicious too."}
{"text":"Delicious, spicy, and so flavorful! I've eaten there twice now and have tried the pad Thai, green curry, spicy noodles and Tom kha soup. Everything was delicious. I ordered level 3 spice and it's perfect. Spicy but edible! Loved it. Can't wait to try everything! Very nice people working there, and very fast service! So happy to have good Thai close to Talent! Go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Best customer service ever! Super friendly woman always takes my order over the phone or in person and it just adds to the great dining experience at Esaan! Great food!"}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food. Family owned with excellent service. Definitely will come back here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant here in Phoenix Oregon. Just stopped in for dinner and everything is great just like usual. Go essan cafe!          I walked up to essan cafe expecting some good Thai food and what I got was great Thai food!  I had pad Thai the first time and it was just fine. The next time I came in I noticed a special board that had stir fried eggplant, basil, jalapeño and shrimp. I've been ordering it every time now.   It's that good.  The sauce is like a sesame ginger sauce. Very yummy with the soft Japanese eggplant. Please give this special a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very surprise!!! Is DELICIOUS  I'll be back any time.  The portions are big and the flavors are awesome!! The mango paradise special was just beyond my expectations like a fine dining.  I'm from Las Vegas and I love THI and this is for sure one of my favorites"}
{"text":"So far so good!!! Pad Thai was great!! Mango yellow curry was fabulous!! Looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING and so kind. Best pumpkin currie I've ever had, and my friend with me agreed. Pad Thai was ALSO the best pad Thai I've ever had. I don't know how they do it.  I feel so lucky to have found this place. It's new and I hope it becomes as successful as it deserves to be!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Rogue Valley. Very friendly family working together to serve the freshest, authentic, Thai food.  We are lucky to have them!"}
{"text":"The yellow mango  curry special was fantastic. Great balance of flavors, ripe mangoes and red Peppers. I ordered it with tofu which was nicely fried. Cashews added a nice texture range  Delicious"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Got the same thing both times. The Yellow curry. First time I was IN LOVE so so so good. Creamy and delicious! And unlike another Thai place I recently went, my curry came with rice! The second time however ... it was like they took the curry and cut it with water. It did not have that rich flavor and creaminess like the first one and actually kind of looked like is was separating ... Everyone else enjoyed their meals though so over all pretty good, I am trying the curry a third time as I hope the second was a fluke"}
{"text":"I have really high standards for Thai food. Its my favorite type of food and everywhere I visit i seek out a thai restaurant. So naturally while visiting Oregon i ended up here. WOW! First, i got the mango curry one day and panang curry the next. I ordered them Thai hot, which is as hot as it gets. Most thai places, likely because they don't want the food returned for being to spicy, usually tone it down several notches. Not here. The level of heat and flavor were everything i expect from a thai dish. From the service, to the atmosphere, to the food, this is hands down of the best thai meals I've had, and that is really saying something. I really wish i had a chance to eat here more often. Cant say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around, period! Service is excellent, menu options are surprisingly broad, portions are very fair, quality of food is top-notch, and the prices are totally reasonable. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious every time and the staff is so sweet! I love having such a wonderful thai place so close to my home."}
{"text":"Mango curry - deli-shish. Rice hot and fluffy. Mango still tender not mushy. Curry is amazing. This place is a find Service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time to visit Esaan Cafe. I didn't want to travel into Medford and it was getting close to 9pm, so we came where my boyfriend comes when I'm at work.  The food here is delicious- and I think some of the folks who only go in Medford need to come try this place out. The people who run this are so genuinely kind and will accommodate any request. I like extra mushrooms and tonight tried the stir fry Pad Prik and I would order this again. Mike likes the special they have of eggplant stir fried- it has more of a five spice flavor profile and is tasty too. I had green curry the first time I visited Esaan and it was delicious as well.  The restaurant seats quite a few- so it doesn't feel cramped. It's been several restaurants before, so it has kind of a mish mash of decorations- the booths look newly recovered and clean. Overall this is a great little restaurant that you should at least give a try.  We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai in the valley. Curries are on point. Pad see ew and pad me too. Get something with eggplant."}
{"text":"Very yummy, good quality Thai food, run by very friendly people-   I have spent months at a time in Thailand and I will tell you, this is some of the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand- and the big smiles and friendly faces makes it even feel like you are in Thailand, the land of smiles, for a moment... very clean and well-run too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I felt this place was just ok. We ordered the Pad Thai, which was pretty good, but the curry was greasy, overly greasy for our tastes and the stir-fry veggies were fairly bland."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Asian food in the area. Busy at diner time on a Wednesday evening. Lots of people phoning in for takeout. All the seats were full by 7pm. People who run it are fast, efficient and very friendly. But the food! OMG! I ordered the spicy noodles with chicken. The spice is just at the limit of hot. Perfect, fresh tasting. My friends ordered chicken and mushroom and another noodle dish. Large portions, enough to have for lunch the next day. All of us enjoyed our time and made plans to return."}
{"text":"Had lunch there a few days ago. Very good food and service. My Pad Prik Khing could have been spicier but the flavor was excellent. I will ask for more spice next time. And there will be a next time soon. I saw several dishes on the menu I look forward to trying."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Sauces all had distinct flavors, unlike many other local Thai restaurants. Reasonable prices. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, super-friendly service, really clean - love this place! Phoenix has a little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Finally! A redeeming food stop in Phoenix (besides La Tap). This new place is a hidden gem, though I feel it wont be so hidden soon. I got a Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup that is not pho, but it will certainly fulfill my pho cravings from now on. Great service- really friendly ladies."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch, first thing I noticed was the lack of investment. There is a trace of all the restaurants that have been here before. Most of the re-used Jack in the Box furniture is gone :)   Also noticed 3 people in the kitchen, which is not the norm here in the valley. Normally a couple thing, he works in the kitchen, she serves.    For those familiar with this location, this happened some years ago, a flip and sell company came in with great food. Only to sell to a couple (the norm) and the food went to hell and they closed. Just like before, the employees were brought up from the bay area. Enough of that, but mark my words.  I went in for lunch had the Spicy Fried Rice $11.99, added beef another $2.00, right out of the gate $13.99, now add a beer $4.00 or Ice Tea $3.50 and you are at the $18.00 mark plus tip. Say $22 for lunch when it is all said and done, it a bit spendy for lunch.  The food was fresh and tasty, something you would get in the bay area, at the same price :)   I gave 4 stars, because of the old mismatched furniture and that the service was slightly less than you would get at Denny's."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha Soup is a MUST have. It comes in a big pot (i split it with my sister) and it was delicious. Having grown up in NYC & have eaten at many Thai restaurants there, i must say, this place exceeded all my expectations & May have taken the cake for best Thai food I've ever had! My sister had the pad see ew and i had the chicken teriyaki. Both were incredible!! So glad to have found this gem whilst on a road trip.  The service was great. There was only one server but she is hard working and hustles. Definitely worth a great tip. If i am ever in Medford, i will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"I live down the road and have been hoping for a great take out place for a while. Esaan is fantastic! The owner was very nice and provided great service, the food was exceptional, and prices are competitive. My noodle dish came with real shrimp (not the weird small shrimp typical of Asian places in the area), and flavors were great. I recommend giving them a try-- by far the best Thai in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Finding authentic, delicious Thai food in Medford after moving here from LA was a welcome surprise indeed. Some of the best Tom Ka Kai soup I've ever had, delicious yellow curry and pineapple fried rice. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had several dishes here during my stay in Ashland, only wish I'd found it sooner. The yellow curry was superb, the eggplant Basel shrimp was outta this world. Really nice waitstaff too."}
