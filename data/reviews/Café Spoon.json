{"text":"Super cute and cozy little spot. Great for an afternoon of relaxed work and study. Not too loud. Full espresso drink menu and you can order from soupe soupe which is directly above. Love the aesthetics of this place."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere to relax and have a good coffee before a long afternoon of meetings and ended up going to Café Spoon. 

It was around 1:30 so it was quite busy, there were a lot of students around... and unfortunately, just one person at the counter which made service a little bit slower than the usual... I wasn't in a rush so it was ok. 

I ordered a matcha and a grilled cheese, then I took a seat near the window surrounded with plants and it felt sooo relaxing. I recommend this little café if you're in the area, it's located on Crescent (underneath the SoupeSoup restaurant) right next to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, you can't miss it!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to get work done with bright lighting, clean table, minimal interior. Very quiet little cafe located in the half basement of one the town houses on Rue Crescent. I can definitely see myself coming here for work after visiting the Fine Arts Museum. The barista is really friendly and accommodating. She let us order 20mins before closing her counter and let my friend order 5mins before closing time. Barista keeps the entire place very organized. The cups and decor are super cute. As for the coffee, I took a cappuccino ($3.80 w/o tax) and the espresso was too bitter for me which is why I'm giving the place a three star. The texture was not as silky as it could be for a cup of cappuccino. But I'd still definitely recommend this place for its ambience. And something tells me that next time around, the coffee might be better!"}
{"text":"Aesthetically pleasing, cute little cafe just across the museum downtown. Good coffee and great place to study. The barista is also nice."}
{"text":"It's a cute spot in the heart of downtown Montreal. 

I am at my 7th stop with my passport barista that I bought from restomania.

The place is very small and cozy. I enjoyed how the place is decorated. So many plants around, so we can breathe well. 

The service is very friendly, helpful and excellent. My server explain what is a cortado since I never tried one. Since it's strong, she was sweet to make me a cappuccino even though it wasn't in the list of the passport. I really appreciated her gesture.

The cappuccino was lovely. My sister had a hot chocolate. As per my sister, it was really good and creamy. 

Plus the place has WIFi. If the café isn't filled, it's a perfect place to do school work, or read a book surrounding plants."}
{"text":"Cute cafe to do work. Portions are very small. Sandwiches are not big at all. Tasty but not worth the price. Matcha latte is very watered down."}
{"text":"Petit café proche de mon travail, en Demi sous-sol, prix très correct et café très bon je conseil vraiment d'aller y faire un tour à emporter comme sur place parfait. De plus si vous avez un petit creux vous y trouverez salade, sandwich, brownie et j'en passe allez y vous verrez ! Je recommande vraiment cette place"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this lovely cafe on a rainy day after visiting the Musee des Beaux Arts. It is located is on the basement level of a traditional house. There are plants everywhere and a variety of coffee drinks. I had a roibos tea with vanilla and berries and the macha financier. Both were lovely. I'd recommend this place as a great way to escape the rain and warm up with some tea!"}
{"text":"This is such a fresh, earthy and bright cafe in the basement. They have bright lights, wood tables, and plates everywhere. I was so sad to have discovered this cafe after I graduated from Concordia. It's the perfect spot to study. 

I loved how they displayed their coffee options with prices but I found the food menu board to crowded and messy! They had a few cake options but I stuck to a cortado and I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"I came here twice once in late summer and the other time in winter, the café is quite hidden because it's underground, but inside it's really nice and full of green vegetation. I tried their coffee and matcha and both are quite good. My friend tried their iced coffee and apparently it is not that cool, which disappoints her a bit. There are not a great lot of choices for pastries and the lunch menu, but if u just need the basic light meal then it is a good spot for you. The price is average and same for the service."}
{"text":"Cute cafe serving food as well. It tends to attract students so it is nice and quiet. Stephanie was very kind and made me a very good latte. They have a beautiful bay window, which is probably the best spot for people watching and working."}
