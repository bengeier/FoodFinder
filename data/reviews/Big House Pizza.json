{"text":"They have some pretty creative pizza toppings. Very accommodating and I can be a bit fussy at times but they are really cool. Hard working and nice guys working there. It's my preferred pizza joint on the Danforth. I've tried quite a few of them on the strip (Pizza Libretto, Danforth Pizza House, Domino's, etc.) Great value for your money.   Must try their wings! Good size wings and great selection of homemade sauces from scratch.  The wings are always cooked right. Juicy and moist!!"}
{"text":"OK, had a long frustrating day and needed something easy. Decided to give Big House another chance. Ordered an On Top of Old Smokey and... well, they rocked it. Pizza was brilliant. I look forward to trying new menu items. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for the day for a Jays game and researched this place beforehand. So we made the trip down to the Danforth and let me tell you, it was well worth it.  We had an order of bbq wings, the rocky balboa chillyphilly cheesesteak and the cookout pizza.   The wings were FANTASTIC and HUGE. Some of the best wings I've had and they were brought out piping hot to start before the pizza. Both of the pizzas were also fantastic. Lots of toppings on both, delicious combinations and cooked to perfection. It's nice to go to a place and try pizzas that are different from your standard pizzas. I love pizzas that have a different base and both of these did. The rocky had a lovely cream base and the cookout had a nice sweet bbq sauce, both went well with the toppings on top. Just fantastic.   Also we only got smalls and they were quite big for a small. Meaning leftovers that I already can't wait to dig into!  The staff were also incredibly friendly and took the time to chat with us and make us feel right at home. It's nice to go into a restaurant where the staff make you feel welcome and they did exactly that.  Definitely a place I will visit again next time I'm in town and wanting some really good pizza.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, nice and close to home friendly service and some cool new creations for your pie. Check it out if you have the chance"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the Danforth (so much better than Libretto).  The Hot Potato is the best white pizza I have ever had.  I have been meaning to try some others but it's so good I keep going back to it."}
{"text":"Used to be really good. Lately takes an hour to be delivered, always burnt, sometimes cold."}
{"text":"Okay,  been a long time in the making for this review.  These guys are Amazing,  haven't even come close to letting me down and I frequent them often enough but not half as often as I would like.  Pizza wise,  these guys deal in the most wonderfully soft and buttery thin crusts possible,  seriously I am not sure how they do it but the crust alone is worth the visit,  as far as toppings...  Well...  Let's just sat they are unique but in a completely epic and amazing way,  check out the \"John A MacDonald\" or as it is lovingly referred the \"Big Mac\"  flavour combinations you would never expect to work work so perfectly it reshapes your whole idea of what pizza is.  If pizza isn't your thing they still have you covered,  aside from the most perfect Italian eatery type sandwiches your taste buds have even experienced they also have salads.  My favorite? Well I'm glad you asked,  is the Jerk Chicken Caesar.  Seriously for a couple of white boys they really get the concept of jerk, incredible.  always perfect heat always fresh while you watch.  I grabbed one today and while I normally grab jerk but this time I was lucky.   This time there was a special,  in-house Applewood smoked cured lamb shoulder seared perfectly,  it fell apart and was perfect.  Seriously amazing.  Try these guys if you are in the area you will NOT be disappointed.  To the staff,  expect my return! I look forward to future specials."}
{"text":"Moved to the area over the weekend. This will be my pizza place going forward. Fresh ingredients, great flavours and a ridiculously great menu for a pizza joint. Was greeted by Jake by name. This pizza joint is legit.   *Update* Lived in the area 10 days now and been there twice, some may call me a pig, and that's true at times, but even this pig doesn't eat crap twice.  2nd visit: John Candied Ham. Great pie! Tried the cheese garlic bread this time too: delish. Customer service is really great here."}
{"text":"Great, original pie. Only problem?!?! I didn't try it sooner!! If you like pizza, this is a must try."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about the pizza here, but man oh man was it bad. Flavourless, undercooked are two words that come to mind. I'm not even that picky about pizza - I will sometimes even dig in to Pizza Pizza with the orange dipping sauce. That said, I do appreciate Libretto and Queen Margherita. If you are looking for pizza on that strip of the Danforth, you are way better off going to Gerrard Spaghetti and Pizza House. They serve perfectly good old fashioned cheesy pizza."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Danforth area.  Locals are fortunate as there are now 2 of the best pizza places on the same block (the other being the great Danforth Pizza House).    Recently tried the \"Hot Pig in the City\" pizza - was impressed by the fresh ingredients, flavour and great value.  Very hearty pizza.  Can't wait to try the others on the menu!"}
{"text":"My favourite specialty pizza in the city! Love the Rob Ford (only time I will ever say that) and the Buffalo chicken. Service is always friendly too."}
{"text":"My bf and I were looking for the best pizza in town and the search led us to Big House Pizza. Surprisingly, it's very close to where we live so we decided to give them a try.  The first time we went was for Sir John A. MacDonald day and got the John A. MacDonald pizza, also known as the big mac pizza. We got a small size, which according to the staff, is equivalent to a medium at the big chain pizza places. Although the pizza looked like a mess and unappetizing at all, it tasted extremely good, just like a McDonald's big mac burger, but in pizza form. The pizza crust was cooked perfectly crispy and the toppings complimented each other well. It exceeded our expectation of the pizza.  The second time we tried their pizza, our friend has ordered the Rob \"the Jerk\" Ford and the Rocky Balboa pizzas. I was excited to try the Rob Ford pizza. When I opened the box to take a slice out, it turns out the slice I was trying to pick up was not cut properly. As I tried to find the cut line on that particular slice, I ended up tearing the pizza and pulled two-fifths of the pizza out. My slice of pizza, is two-fifths of the whole pizza. The pizza was cut VERY unevenly. There was another slice that was about one-fifth of the pizza, another one that is about one-fourth of the pizza and one odd sliver slice in between. I ended up having to eat the ginormous two-fifth slice by myself. Although the pizza tasted ok, we were disappointed that the pizza didn't have more chicken on it. The smaller slices of the Rob Ford pizza had little to no chicken at all. Given that the pizza was not cut evenly, my ginormous pizza slice probably took most of the chicken from the pizza. The jalapeno cream sauce didn't taste like jalapeno. But it was a very cheesy pizza.  The Rocky Balboa pizza is pretty much a philly cheese steak pizza. This pizza tasted better than the Rob Ford pizza but the same thing happened when my bf tried to take a slice of it. He grabbed a large two-fifth slice out. Also the toppings on the Rocky Balboa was not distributed evenly. All the toppings were concentrated in the middle of the pizza and there was nothing but cheese about 2 inches from the crust. Also both pizza crusts felt a bit doughy, like it's not cooked well enough.  We were a bit disappointed during our second try at this is pizza place as it was listed on Blog To as one of the best pizzas in Toronto. We might come back a third time to see if it's just an inconsistency issue. Both times we ordered the pizza to go."}
{"text":"BEST. PIZZA.  Those two words sum up what has become a favourite haunt of mine. Perfect crust with innovative combinations of local ingredients served up by authentic and engaged owner/creators.   Even better, they're next to the best craft beer bar in the city (The Only Cafe) which allows outside food, and these guys happily deliver next door (or you could pop by and pick up a slice).   Best take out or delivery pizza in the city, hands down."}
{"text":"I love LOVE this place. It has made me obsessed with Pizza. They have crazy signature pizzas, including one that is made like a big mac - complete with special sauce and sesame crust. I have tried a couple others that are just as good.   Only thing is they undercook for my liking, you might want to ask for well done.  But seriously this is REALLY good pizza, and it is CHEAPER than all of the other nearby haunts we used to order from (Pizza Nova, Pizzaolio, Pizzaville) that end up closer to $30 for a well-toppinged pie. Plus they are nice. I like when people are pleasant on the phone.   HIGHLY recommended.  (And if you read this Big House, we could really use a location in Riverside or so)"}
{"text":"Final update: gave into the addiction for another shot. Sir John A Mac was good. Really good. Really, really good. A glorious, delicious pizza pie.   Bravo gentlemen,  bravo."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hot Pig in the city.  First time having their pizza.  Was very impressed by the quality of the toppings.  Fresh whole roasted  garlic cloves, lots of cheese, high quality Kalamata olives, great tomato sauce, cappicola was good.  I usually order extra sauce at most places but this place I didn't have too.  I will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"Man. It really is Toronto's best pizza. Had the Sir John A (big mac pizza) and it was AWESOME."}
{"text":"Unfortunately was very unimpressed with the pizza we ordered (this was our second  time ordering to give another chance). The crust was soggy and doughy, I ended up only eating the toppings. This could be due  to them using giant wet flavourless hothouse tomatoes instead of the roma ones as per their site. We added on kalamata olives for $, there were only 12 pieces on the whole xl pizza, one of which contained part of a pit ... The bbq chicken was all the end scrappy bits. We ended up dousing it in hot sauce just to get some flavour.  It's disappointing as the location is close to my house and they are super friendly on the phone and the order was on time..."}
{"text":"ordered two pizzas for delivery. The CookOut Pizza and the Hot Potato. The guy on the phone who took my order (Jake?) was super cool and nice. The guy who delivered my pizzas, half an hour later, super cool and nice as well.  The food?  can I just say.....thank you for moving into the hood!  So damn yummy was the pie. I love all the not-so-normal pizza choices. I am a happy girl. I will be back for more pizza."}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE pizza place in the city. My husband I come here every Tuesday for cheat night and it never disappoints. The crust is unreal and combo of ingredients are creative and fun. It's also great that you can take out and eat the pizza at The Only next door and have a delicious craft beer to wash it down. The owner is also super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Had a John Candyed Ham pizza yesterday as a part of their \"Christopher Walkin\" special. Essentially their take on meat lovers. It was delish. It's like an amazing version of your normal local place. It's not thin crust so if thats what you're going for this ain't the place for you. Expect rich toppings, fresh dough  and a place with funky, cool vibes.  More on the Walkin special; it's $21 for a pizza and a lb of wings. The wings we got cajun were big suckers, and fresh. Some of the best I've had in a while, period.   If you're on the fence definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.    Had the \"Buffaloes Have Wings\" pizza last night and it may be one of the best pizza's I've had.  Crust was delicious and the ingredients worked brilliantly together.    Service was really friendly and welcoming.    Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Either these guys got a lot of friends to write good reviews or Torontonians are so use to bad pizza, this actually taste good to them.   I don't like giving a mediocre review when the owner is so nice... he even shook my hand and introduced himself. A very nice guy.  Here it goes.... The place is pleasant and definitely better than Librettos down the street but as far as pizza is concerned, I would say it lives up to Toronto style pizza, which is not good. It is next to impossible to get good pizza in Toronto and this place while better than some lives up to Toronto's reputation and does little to improve on Toronto's reputation for pizza, which is not good. To date I would have to say FBI in Etobicoke still holds the title for best pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the gnocchi. It's made from seasonal vegetables. Mine was not made from potatoes but from charred peppers. It was divine!! Try it with the cream sauce."}
{"text":"Umm... I'd say a little pricey for pizza. It was nothing to write home about, but decent. Would I order again...ummm...probably not. I'd likely give another pizza joint a try before going back. We ordered the Rob Ford pizza- can't remember the exact name."}
{"text":"Big House serves up some delicious and unique pizzas! I'm not generally too adventurous when it comes to pizza because I really like spicy and tend to go for all the hot toppings every time but I opted for their balsamic topped specialty and it was phenomenal! They have a lot of fun and creatively named pies, but you can also make your own if nothing grabs your eye.   The guys behind the counter are super chill and extremely nice. They know how to ensure you enjoy your experience and will offer up suggestions if you're unsure of what you're looking for.   I suggest you grab a pie and head over to the only for a few beers on the patio to help wash down all the goodness. This is pretty much my MO in regards to this place!  One of the most enjoyable pizza places in he area!"}
{"text":"I was devastated to see Amaro disappear one day but glad these guys replaced em.  The Philly cheese steak pizza is out of hand!  Huge strips of tasty steak cover the pizza and they don't cheap out on the toppings, the pie was loaded.  And that cream sauce they use on it is amazing.  I like the variety the menu provides and even a str8 up pepperoni was delicious.   Add to that the owners are good guys and genuinely appreciate the business.  A Place like this is much needed there's nothing but pizza chains for the most part on danforth or pretentious joints like the severely overrated libretto."}
{"text":"Holy crap! The Danforth needs more stuff like this. Had the \"Cookout\" & \"Hot Potato\" and they did not disappoint! Ill go out on a limb and say some of the best pizza in the city. Don't go in expecting the neapolitan style down the street at Libretto. This is more of the pizza you crave (or at least I do) when you think of pizza. We also ordered the Hot Wings, super spicy and very flavourful but not overpowering.  This place opening up in the neighbourhood is bad news for me.  I live far too close to this place, I'm gonna get fat..."}
{"text":"This place started out great.  Really nice guys, unique menu and pretty good pizza overall. But it's gone down hill.  The pizza quality isn't what it you used to be.  Delivery is quite a bit slower than your average delivery pizza.  And it's worse when you walk in for a slice.  First of all, I don't know what the hours are, but the place is often closed when I assume it will be open. And when I find myself lucky enough to find it open, I often find that they don't have any slices.  Imagine going to a burger place and being told \"Yeah we don't have any burgers right now. Sometimes we do.\"  Come on guys, get back in the game.  I miss you."}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment and one of the owners is a real arrogant jerk. I ordered wings for delivery and asked for them baked instead of fried. He said that they don't usually do that but they will try. Well, it was a disaster. They weren't done nearly well enough - not nearly enough to eat. How could they let the wings leave like that - garbage!  I called and he said that he would send the delivery guy back to pick them up and refund my money.   Well, no show.   We called and called - no answer. So I decided to personally take them back. When I got there, the lights were off (and before closing time) but they were there. I told them that they weren't answering so I decided to deliver the wings to them for them - the delivery guy was lounging in the back. The owner immediately said that he wasn't going to give me my money back because he told me that they don't usually make them that way. I told him that if he wasn't up for the challenge that he should have told me that he can't do it.  But he continued to say how he wasn't going to give me my money back because he told me.  Obviously not a business man of his word.   Looking at the other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one having challenges with these guys. Looks like they are heading for a crash and their arrogant owners aren't helping the situation.   Too bad because it used to be a really good place with good food. Not so much anymore. You've done it to yourselves guys."}
{"text":"3.75 stars  We've ordered Big House numerous times and have had mixed experiences.   The Good: - Unique pizzas! Our favourites are The Cookout and the Sir John Macdonald - Wings are large and flavourful  - Delivery guys are cool.   The Bad: - Inconsistency. Have had excellent experiences and then recently had an order where the pizza looked rushly made and the wings were very overdone and under-seasoned.   I'd still give them another go but would like to see more consistency."}
{"text":"been 5 times, fav pizza place I've been to in Toronto yet. and the people working there are are friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Big House Pizza is awesome. The staff are friendly, the ingredients are fresh, the crust is perfect, and the pizzas they come up with are out of this world. My favorite is the John A. MacDonald (aka Big Mac Pizza) - you have to try it. I crave this pizza. I dream about this pizza. I could eat this pizza every day. I'd like to try the entire menu but John A. keeps pulling me back! We did try Hot Pig in the City and John Candyed Ham, and both were delish."}
{"text":"Awesome!  I've never met friendlier staff in a restaurant.  Chris I think is one of the owners and introduced himself and was great.  As for the pizza I went two days in a row and will be back many more times to try everything on the menu.   Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Hot damn! (Can I say that?) Anyhoo, after trying to get into Pizzeria Libretto on the Danforth without any reservations and told I'd have to wait over an hour to get seated, I was feeling impatient, hungry and cranky (hangry!!) and politely said, \"Helllllls NO!\" and promptly fired up the Yelp app to check out the best pizza nearby.  I was so glad that I discovered Big House Pizza, so let's get into that.  The Pizza I had was the Rocky Balboa Philly Chilli Cheese Steak Pizza.  It featured a nice thin crust that was just at the right moisture level, the cheese was ooey gooey good, along with a nice crunch in the crust that didn't leave my mouth dry after gobbling it up.  I'd have to say the pizza sauce was the highlight of this pizza.  I've never had a fettucine based white sauce on a pizza before - I can't quite describe it as it was brought all the ingredients together as it was the last thing I tasted before swallowing my already gigantic bites (think Michaelangelo swallowing pizza slices...)  I'm already excited to check out the rest of their pizzas as they have really fun/cheeky names for them.. next up may be the Rob Ford pizza for me :)"}
{"text":"The fries were out of this world! Couldn't believe how crispy they were having been delivered! The Ain't No Mis-Steak pizza was amazing! Wasn't sure about the baked potato, but it worked surprisingly well. Good times!!"}
{"text":"Just had the John A. Macdonald and it was the best slice I have had in a very long time. I never thought I would eat pizza with lettuce and pickles on it but wow! Simply amazing."}
{"text":"Big House Pizza is some of the best take out pizza on the Danforth, but seems to have a large amount of management and quality control issues.   The staff are all great, they are very welcoming and friendly, but the hours are beyond ridiculous. They open and close at any given time. I have attempted to order a pizza between 6-8pm on a Saturday and (several) Sundays only to find the lights out. This has been a consistent issue that i've experienced and have heard from countless other people.  When the pizza is done right it is easily one of the best, but it seems to be a gamble. It may completely depend on who's making it. I've had issues from sparse toppings to the crust being burnt.  I really hope they pull it together, because it can be amazing, just wish it was more consistent."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best pizza in Toronto.  My favorite is the Rob the Jerk Ford - it is absolutely incredible!!   The layers of spice (Jalapeno cream sauce, spicy jerk chicken made in house and banana peppers) go perfectly with the sweet pineapple.   I have yet to try the more stuff on the menu but I will definitely be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing service experience! The guy on the phone was SO helpful. I had 12-13 family members over for dinner and wanted some advice on how much to order. The guy gave great recommendations on size and selection for well-rounded pizza choices; He was very friendly. The pizza showed up 10 mins early - and the driver was aware and (unnecessarily) apologetic (better than late!!). Great pizza for a crowd. I wanted to order more of a Queen M style but heard that if you're ordering many pizzas at once, you run the risk of it getting cold (plus you have to pick up yourself). Big House Pizza was hot, yummy & a hit!"}
{"text":"I had been here before and had a great pizza but after two recent visits I'm not sure what happened to this place.  The problem seems to be with their crust, its too think, too dry and kind of makes me think it was once frozen which if I was certain I would give them one star.  The topping on top are cool and creative but its all ruined by the cardboard like crust."}
{"text":"I just finished the gluten free pizza from Big House and i have to say it was the worst pizza i have ever had. The pizza was small, misshapen and tasted like cardboard! hard and tastless. i have had my share of gluten free pizza's and this was by far the worst....not to mention that it was a rip off.   Maybe their other pizza's are good but stay away from the GF."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Unfortunately my husband and I don't live in Toronto so this can't be our regular go to spot.  But If you guys have a place near Los Angeles, we would be eating there regularly.   We tried this place because it came highly recommended and it lived up to its reputation. The delivery drivers both times were prompt and professional.  The food was so good that during out 6 day stay in Canada we ordered from them twice!    There are plenty of delicious options on the menu so take your time and order something good.  We had a prosciutto pizza the first time and the margarita pizza the second time."}
{"text":"Ordered a large sir john a Mac Donald pizza for take out over the phone. The staff was friendly and informative. I asked if I could do a half and half with the speciality pizzas and she said no because the sauces are too different and would bleed into each other and ruin the taste. You can only do half and half with the build your own toppings or the pie ones. She told us pick up is in 25 minutes.   The restaurant itself is very spacious. They had mug shots of many A list actors on their wall. It's clean and there are several tables available for groups.   Pizza itself definitely tasted like a Big Mac. The sauce was really good. I wished there were more beef on the pizza. It was well covered with pickles and lettuce, but not enough meat. Crust was a bit hard for my liking, but it definitely was not soggy despite all the sauce. A solid 3.5 in my opinion for this pizza. I definitely want to try their others. They have such creative names for their speciality pizzas."}
{"text":"I love supporting small, local businesses in my neighbourhood, so we gave this place a try the other night. As others have noted, the staff - from the guy who took the order to the delivery guy - is exceptionally friendly.  We ordered the El Matador and the bacon cheddar potatoes. The pizza was tasty, nice distribution of toppings, though not quite as spicy as I was expecting. The crust had good heft to it and nice texture, though sadly the underside of my piece of the pie was a little burnt.  The bacon cheddar potatoes were nice and crispy with lots o' cheese and bacon on top.   Will definitely be trying this place again next time the mood for pizza strikes. Just need to convince my husband to be a little more adventurous and try one of the more creative/inventive topping combinations (eyeing up the steak ones...). Maybe I'll just order my own. :)"}
{"text":"Just had the Rob The Jerk Ford pizza and it was killer.  I was pretty skeptical about how the jerk would taste, but it was definitely flavorful and spicy.   And the crust.   Oh the effing crust. I normally throw you out, like a forgotten soldier, but at Big House? No crumb left behind.  I'm just down the street, so this is going to be big, bad, terrible, horrible, no good news for me.  I eat all the pizzas."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the great pies when this place opened. It was turning out excellent pizza for YEARS. Excellent! Over the last year or so it's been pretty underwhelming. I'm not sure what's changed but the John A. took a huge nose dive in quality-both in ingredients and preparation. Ordered a Canadian the other night and the cheese slid right off the thinly sauce crust. The crust was much more bready too. I really wish they would put the effort in that they did when it first opened. Huge decline in quality. Plus they vastly overestimate how long it takes to get an order ready. Estimate: 25min. Actual: 45min. :("}
{"text":"Goodbye mainstream pizza joints and hello Big House! Why would anyone go back to corporate pizza? Check out their menu here. It is fantastic stuff!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I've read about the John A (big mac) pizza so I thought I would try it out.  Their signature pizza sounds great and really creative but they really don't deliver the flavour.    We ended up ordering the John Candyed Ham and the Hot Potato as well as the Luca Brasi sandwich.  The pizzas were light on toppings and flavour, other than salt, very salty pies.  Very little sauce, the cheese tastes very processed, the dough is very dense and bready.    The reviews for this place seem to be all over the place so I am not sure if this was an off night but I won't be returning for pizza.  I will say that the sandwich we had was really good - may go back for that."}
{"text":"Sorry to be part of this establishments downtrend reviews but honestly my sweetie and I were hugely disappointed. We ordered a Margherita and a build ur own with mushrooms, hot peppers and onions (or at least we thought the sinew-y, fibrous strings that got caught in our teeth might be onions). I really have to start taking photos but when a new pizza comes home to our place it's like a life size game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos and if I stop to take a photo, I could miss out. Anyway, I'm in sad agreement with some of the other reviewers that either Big House has suffered a few chef changes which often go hand in hand with a slide in the quality or the one reviewer who may have it right that Torontonians really don't know a good pizza or are just too damned polite to say much.  At any rate, this was our first experience with Big House and we're not likely to give it another try for several reasons. First I must comment on the pleasant ordering experience with the staff on the phone and the warm greeting when picking up the pizza so 5 stars on that front but as we sat waiting for our order I was disturbed to watch as a well meaning employee began sweeping the floors creating airborn dust plumes blowing directly at us and settling on the freshly made pizza which had just been placed on the counter to rest. I was speechless.  Then the moment of truth as we unboxed the pies at home to find that the custom order was extremely overcooked - even the cheese was a crusty, dried out brown, scant mushrooms and unrecognizable onions covered by a nondescript sauce all atop the mediocre crust. The Margherita was a little better but I was again disappointed to find that there was no fresh mozzarella fior di latte and what may have been a San marzano tomato but now a skimpy dried out few slices of red mush.   Too bad, so sad that the menu was a far better read than the actual pizzas.   And so ends my dusty tale of our \"pizza unrequited\" experience at the Big House."}
{"text":"The toppings here all sound great, and unique, but the quality control may be an issue like other reviews have mentioned.  We ordered a John A MacDonald and Rob \"The Jerk\" Ford. The Jerk really could have used more pineapple. If you want spicy it was definitely spicy though. Overall the toppings weren't evenly dispersed either.  The saddest part about the pizza is the crust. It is dense in a bad way. And just seems really heavy and not soft at all. I've never seen so many uneaten crusts left on plates. And a lot of the toppings were nowhere near to the end of the crust so it left a lot of uneaten pizza."}
{"text":"Just attempted to eat the Rob Jerk Ford...too heavy on the peppers..I like hot but all you can taste is raw pepper...To bad I've had better from these guys...this pizza as almost inedable Would not order this again...the veal sandwich last time was great though. The last one that we ordered..was great..this was very disappointing ."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good pie but not my style. The bread is too soft a doughy and the toppings are not spread out throughout. The quality in ingredients are good and I commend the effort."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sir John A MacDonald pizza as my \"prime\" pick and it was pretty epic. I live close and did a pick up. Pizza was crispy on the under side but was saucey on top. It was also crunchy with lettuce and plenty of toppings. Really tasted like you were eating a Big Mac but with more texture and an intense sauce. Again the crust was awesome. The only downside is that it put me in a food coma but that's my fault for having 4 slices when 2 should suffice for a normal human. Looking forward to the next pizza order."}
{"text":"My fam and i were absolutely starving from coming in from our long travel and we chose this pizzeria nearby. The delivery man was really nice and the food was so good. I would order again"}
{"text":"A much needed addition to the neighbourhood, and a big step up from the former Amaro Pizza that was here.  I've tried 4 different kinds of pizza so far and they have all been solid.  Better than any of the nearby chains or the much over-rated Danforth Pizza House (which has the most rubbery cheese on the block).  I had my first delivery order tonight and it was fast and delicious (with an awesome long-haired rock star doing the delivery).  Fresh ingredients go a long way in the pizza kitchen, and I hope they continue on this route in the future.    Their unique toppings, amusing names and excellent customer service put this over the top and add an extra star for me.  Chris and Jake, the two pizza chefs/owners, shook my hand and introduced themselves to me on my first visit.  There are many danforth restaurants that could learn from this kind of neighbourly attitude."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Very friendly guys. Nice restaurant. I would like to give them 5/5 but they disappointed in a couple of areas. The BBQ sauce seemed to be made of %100 Tabasco Sauce (if you think I'm a wimp...whatever) it was misleading, BBQ sauce is BBQ sauce not super spicy sauce (and I don't mind spicy).  The BBQ sauce is killer spicy. The pizza crust was pretty tough, and tasted like cardboard. One of the pizza guys didn't wash their hands prior to placing the basil on the pizza with their bare hands. Tasty stuff and pretty cool guys but certainly not supreme, and certainly not better than a chain pizza joint."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because it meets my taste bud needs, it's an awesome joint in the neighborhood, it's locally owned and doesn't make you feel like a pile of crud when you're done eating it.  And as an East Coast Native from the States who eats the crap out of pizza, they do it right.  Great pizza, great guys serving up some magic slices of pizza pie.  I've had my share of pizza and this place feels like your Little Italy neighborhood style pizzeria.  I'm from Boston area and lived in New York, San Francisco, Chicago for a while and this place is a great go to.  I've ordered for the office staff and for \"pizza and a movie night at home\" and these guys do it right.  Not oily, great crust that's simple and light and the ingredients are fresh.  Great balance of ingredients and everything cooked through but tasted like they came from the garden.  Friggin fresh pies all the way for sure.  They've been on time with deliveries and the box is never smashed.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"The big house is pretty solid. Decent value and some creative ideas on their pizza. Good balance of crust and  pizza sauce. On their club pizza, I would go without the lettuce. Wilts and doesn't add any flavor. Otherwise it is good value."}
{"text":"I just can't do it anymore. I loved you so much, Big House. I tell people that I've had my favorite delivery pizza from there but something changed for the worst. I have ordered your pizza multiple times (delivery and pick up) and the last 4 times have been unacceptable.   The cheese and toppings do not stay on your pizza and it creates a soggy mess, every. single. time. First time you explained to me that it could've been from the liquid from the homemade banana peppers, but it happened even with cheese only pizzas. We carried it to The Only Cafe (two doors down) and the toppings had slid off the pizza like I was holding it vertically under my arm (I wasn't).   We're done, Big House. We're done."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently moved around the corner from Big House Pizza, and, frankly, we didn't pay it much mind until, one night, friends recommended we try the Sir John A McDonald pizza. It was INCREDIBLE. Tasted like a Big Mac in the best possible way. We've had the Hawaiian and, tonight, the Hot Pig in the City pizza and they were delicious, too. Now we want to try everything on the menu! For great, original pizza creations, Big House Pizza is a must-try. Don't sleep on this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This has been on the 'to try' list for a while now, success! I wish they didn't close so early. After much deliberation, we decided on a large John Candied Ham ($27 not including tip) for maximum piggly overload.   That it was not. Considering the reviews and price tag the toppings were sparse and the crust was very doughy and actually slightly raw in the center. We called for pickup and were told 25 minutes and ended up waiting an extra 15. I don't mind if it takes 40, just tell me that so I'm not standing around when I'm calling for pickup to clearly avoid exactly that.  While waiting, we enjoyed the décor of portraits of famous people who have been to jail aka the Big House (GET IT?!) and also heard every other order asking for a pizza well done. Would definitely get that/recommend that next time, since apparently that means 'cooked through'.  Will probably end up back here for a second chance since the sauce was great and the toppings were of high quality."}
{"text":"I am a day away from starting a clean eating challenge - and pizza isn't on the menu. I guess you could call this my 'Last Meal'. Appropriate... and perfect.  Everything about my experience with Big House Pizza was top notch. Let's start with the food.   I ordered a pizza for delivery. They have a minimum $20 order for delivery, which is honestly no big deal. Just order a large pie. You'll eat a large pie (and if you won't, people will help you). It's that good. I wanted something simple, and although they have some stellar-looking gourmet options on the menu, I went with the Jimmy \"Margharittaville\" Buffett. My pizza arrived and I gasped as it came out of the carrier. It was steaming hot! Steamy! Straight from the oven to my door! It's the stuff dreams are made of. I am so sick of getting warm delivery.   The crust was dense, but I found it perfectly cooked - not undercooked, not too chewy. It also has really great flavour. Reminded me of the bread I used to eat in Germany. Salty with olive undertones. The toppings were fresh and well dispersed on the pie. I would have liked a bit more basil but that would be my only improvement.   Aside from the pizza I feel I couldn't do this review justice with commenting on the service. Absolutely perfect. I called in without knowing where the delivery zone was and had a great chat with the guy on the phone. Living in the east end is usually a hit or miss for delivery joints and I was thrilled to hear I could get delivery to my place. The dude on the phone also let me know about some recent specials and took the time to enquire how I had heard about them. It was a genuinely great chat - which you normally don't have when ordering pizza. And the guy who delivered (I believe the man on the phone referred to him as the 'Dragon') was friendly and helpful. He even stopped my cat from escaping - which happens all too often.   As I eat my pizza I'm becoming more and more sad. First, because I am starting this silly clean eating challenge tomorrow and second because I am moving out of the delivery zone in two weeks. I guess that just means I'll have to make some trips to the Danforth in the future...."}
{"text":"The first two times I ordered from here, the pizza came quickly (about 30 minutes) and was really tasty. Last week, however, I had some guests over and was quite disappointed. It took over an hour to arrive, by which point it was cold. But it was also burned pretty badly. Cold, burned pizza was embarrassing to serve, especially after I'd been telling my friends how good this pizza was. I really hope this isn't going to be what it's like in the future! I'm a little nervous to order again..."}
{"text":"I've been trying various pizza places in my area of town and this was next on my list. I ordered online for pickup and was impressed that I got a confirmation call. That rarely happens anymore in this day and age. While the menu online was a bit incomplete, when I discovered they had Brio (unlisted on the website) they had no issue whatsoever switching out my Sprite. They were very friendly, even asked how I heard about the place. They complimented my choice of toppings for my pizza and even suggested what I might like next time (and there will be a next time for sure). That pizza was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever had in my life."}
