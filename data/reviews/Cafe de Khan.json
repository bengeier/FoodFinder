{"text":"My favourite Pakistani/Indian restaurant in GTA.  It's worth the drive to Mississauga even if you are in Ajax to come to this place.  They have the best Bihari Kabab, Peshawari Kabab, Karahi dishes and over all dishes I've tried (which is almost all of them) are super delicious and mouth watering.  It's a little small, so, it's always a good idea to call and make sure they are not busy before going - as it's quite popular and there is often a wait, especially on weekends.  That alone tells you that this is a great place :)"}
{"text":"Food is good! Service is pathetic!!! Make sure you visit there at least one and a half hour before their closing time because after that they give damn about how you feel about their service or food, their only concern would be reaching home on time! 
Also, can not believe that they do not accept American Express card in these days! even a small hawker accepts it!"}
{"text":"This place had terrible service. Their food was overpriced and not that good for the most part. I think I did like their kababs and the naans/parathas."}
{"text":"BBQ is very nice, especially seekh kabaab and paratha are quite authentic, Behari kabaabs are as behari as it could get (coming from someone with lots of behari friends). Chicken Karahi is very good too, the portions are a bit small, food is a lil pricey but definitely worth the money. Weekends can be quite busy, so get there early."}
{"text":"Food is quite good though the portions could be bigger. I found the bihari kabab roll to be perfect and the chicken reshmi kababs delicious. The rest was fine - nothing special, though not lacking either. Except maybe the chicken shashlik which I wouldn't get again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, however it is extremely oily. 

Good for the days you feel like slacking."}
{"text":"Their Bihari kababs are awesome. Other than that Tikkas were average. They got my order wrong and I had to go back and pick up the order a second time. Don't recommend their service and recommend that you double check the order when you pick it up."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick meal here.  Liked the fast service. The chicken kababs were moist and tasty, the palak paneer and butter chicken were delicious too .  Hot naan was fresh and fluffy but dripping in butter (ugh! I always forget to mention to skip the butter).  Enjoyed this place overall which has flavourful food without the spiciness."}
{"text":"Came here last minute because the other restaurant didn't work out. VERY much worth it. The menu was very nice and I ordered my favourite Malai Tikka with Naan. The order came in under 20 minutes which was very nice. The environment itself was very peaceful with music playing lightly all around the restaurant. The staff was very helpful and available in a few seconds. The prices were good and not as expensive as I thought and even if it seems a bit expensive, it's very much worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Seriously the best Pakistani food in the GTA. Ordered the chicken and beef seekh kebab. Came out fresh and soft. Also got the palak paneer which was delicious. 

Must try for anyone who loves pakistani cuisine. Would encourage the service to be a bit better as we kept on having to get the waiter's attention."}
{"text":"Never ever go here. I came with family for iftaar and it's been 25 minutes no food. We pre-ordered so don't have to wait for very long. Nothing.
Lady who took the order said there will be khajoors/dates with juice, the waiter said no khajoors..finally he brought some stale from inside after asking repeatedly or else would have brought from home. The worst worst customer services with no sorry and all the excuses in the world..seems like eating for free. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The best Authentic Pakistani food ever in North America and the service is impeccable. Very reasonable prices for quality food"}
{"text":"Last night I was at cafe with my family. Place is much nicer then brittania location, food portions are more generous and quality of food is define tlx better then previous experiences. I would definetly give it a better rating. It's also pick up and delivery. I don't know if they have wi-fi."}
{"text":"All bbq items here are good but only the BBQ. The rest of the staff,  I would definitely avoid.  Their speciality is only bbq.  Great bihari,  Chicken Tikka,  malai boti, parathas, kababs,.  The combo deals are great!"}
{"text":"i think this is the only Pakistani restaurant which serves decent food the only thing is it is a bit expensive"}
{"text":"Service - 20 minutes before waiter reaches you. 45 min in total for food to arrive
Food - Delivered wrong order, Parathas were actually deep fried Bathura. Asked for Onions 3 times. Every time they said yes but it never arrived. No green Chutney with kebabs
Cleanliness: Below standard
Price: High for the standard and quality you get
Food Tastes ok but nothing good."}
{"text":"Garbage food. Small portions. The only good thing was the parathas. Everything is over priced and you barely get any food. I wouldnt return and i wouldnt recommend it. Waste of money so save it and go else where."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite Pakistani restaurant, especially in Mississauga. While BBQ is a mainstay at most restaurants (and theirs is amazing - kebabs and tandoori chicken on the bone being highlights) their karaahis are incredible. My brother in law travels from the States just salivating over the Matka Gosht. Though we grab takeout from time to time because of the rush (portions are still big and everything stays closed because they wrap it tight), I love eating there because the service is always warm and friendly. 

I know I've been going since they opened and upon wishing that they'd open a second location (downtown folks!) I realized I'd have to share the brilliance of this place after all."}
{"text":"Best parathas and Bihari kababs in the GTA! Chicken tikkas are great too and decent prices love this place! Really good customer service as well which is hard to find at a desi restaurant overall 5/5"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the price is high and the portions, as others have noted are very small.  It's unfortunate that they don't give you more.  It is as if they are serving kids size portions for adults.  If you aren't that hungry or don't each much, its great. But if you eat like an average Canadian, you won't be satisfied. With the Pakistani population what it is in Mississauga its unfortunate we don't have better dining options."}
{"text":"As a traveling consultant I go all around the world and try different food.  I found Cafe De Khan here on Yelp and based on the reviews I visited this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service I received from the restaurant.  I went with the recommendation of the waiter/cashier and the food was fresh, hot, and very flavorful.  Since my first visit I have gone there every time I am in the Brampton area."}
{"text":"Very bad exp, they microwaved frozen food and cause all small pieces in container.. Very bad"}
{"text":"We came here for my son's birthday. Service was slow as \"they prepare food from scratch when you order\". But food was amazing. Delicious. Fresh and frankly the best I've had in Mississauga. Every dish had been prepared in an authentic manner and BBQ was just out of this world. Highly recommend. Will visit again.

Hoping for better service next time but the food was worth it. They recommended that we call ahead so they can prep in advance. I still gave tip for amazing food."}
{"text":"For those who are looking for authentic Pakistani food, please do not go here. You will be disappointed.  Tandoori time and Karahi point in North York are way better options."}
{"text":"Date of Visit - July 1, 2016.
Worst tasting food ever. This restaurant is awful. 
The chicken kabob were ready made / frozen that could be reheatable. These kabobs you can get from WALMART. And these guys wanted us to pre-order when reserving for our table. If we were getting frozen kabobs why not just take the order when we come in. They are heatable in 2 minutes. 
The naan is the size of a small child's head. You can literally finish the naan in one bite and they cost 2.25 (rip off).
Malai Tikka -- are you kidding me no comment on this dish it was just bad
Chicken Karahi - they must have gotten this recipe from pinterest hashtag generic
The only thing that was good here on our visit was the ROOH AFZA - which was free. 
My family is so disappointed. My mom has given up hope. My dad has stopped talking to me and he is planning on not celebrating EID. He will donate his BRAND NEW shalwar kameez. My sister is traumatised. My brother had a heart attack. As for myself, I wasted 1/4 of yearly salary on this HUGE mistake."}
{"text":"This place has the taste of home. Tikka, Bihari Kabab, Nan, Chutney and Salad. Quick and courteous service an close to the highway."}
{"text":"Pakistani BBQ is probably this restaurant's specialty. We had Peshawari kababs, bihari Kabab, lamb Biryani and their chargha. Each of the items was truly delicious. We went early in the evening and there weren't too many tables with clients, so service was quite good, we've been there before at the usual desi dinner time, i.e. 9pm, we had to Wait for a table and the service was extremely slow.
So have an early dinner, get good service and enjoy delicious food at this restaurant."}
{"text":"It is a very nice sit in restaurant, bihari kabab were great, taste was good, little small portion and price is right on a higher level."}
{"text":"I had initially went to Cafe De Khan when it first opened in Heartland. My impression were that food was always good but the quantity was too low for the price when compared to other similar restaurant. This gets very expensive when you are with a family.

Shout out to Coco C. for her review. I read that review and I found out about their weekday lunch specials, which seemed to be bang for the buck. Hence, I book marked the place for a day off during the week.

Walked in to the restaurant and the only server was very friendly. We were given menus but no lunch special menu, so I asked and the server stated they are not serving the lunch special as it was the second day of Eid. This didn't make sense as the restaurant was empty and it was a working day, plus other people working nearby came for lunch and asked the same thing. Any how we looked at the menu and the prices didn't make sense so we left. The server came running outside to get us as she stated they are now serving the lunch special as she asked the folks in the kitchen because all the customers are asking about it. 

We love the options in the Thali  and ordered one with Chicken and other with Beef kababs. The Thali included 2 kababs, butter chicken, channa masala, rice, naan, rita, and salad. Price was very doable on the Thali and made sense. The Portions were satisfying and there is no competition with their Kababs. Foodwise I would give them 4.5 stars.

Overall, Food was great & pricing is reasonable on the Thali.

P.S. They server halal food!"}
{"text":"Firstly, lot of people make a mistake by thinking this as an Indian cuisine. Cafe de Khan started back in da'days in Karachi and was very famous. This here my friends is Pakistani Cuisine. 

The place is quite small for large families and the price is high for the portions they provide. The food on the other hand is good but then again being a meat eater and part of a big family this didn't hit the spot. We had to order a lot and hence, resulted in a high bill.  The food is a little on the spicy side which I like.

The service was good, the server chatted with us nicely and brought the food quick. For my Muslim friends they here serve halal food. 

This would have been a 4 star for me if the portion were regular size as at other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Cafe D Khan in Pakistan, so brings back a lot of childhood memories.
Went for lunch at this location and they were offer I g lunch Thalis.  I  love options so Thalis and buffets are my absolute favourites!
Had the lunch Thali which included kababs, rice, nan and spinach (Saag paneer). Price was very reasonable. Very satisfying portions as well. 
My only wish is ....hope they had a broader menu and not just grilled kebabs. I would love it if they included nihari, paya and Haleem ; that would do the Cafe D Khan name tag some justice!!"}
{"text":"Best bihari paratha roll in town! Amazing and fast service too. Love the place and the food."}
{"text":"Love this place
I went there for the tenth time yesterday for lunch. They have a delicious and affordable lunch specials for 10.99.
Includes naan, salad, Raita, potatoes, butter chicken, rice, and a choice of beef or chicken. 
Very big portion and amazing taste.  Would be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is slow, the food is mediocre and the setting is not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. Their parathas are fried bathuras. The bbq tandoori chicken was too dry and when we ordered a gravy based dish we literally got 3 pieces of chicken tikka in an ocean of gravy. They kept forgetting our naan and once we revived it it was hard, they did replace it with a fresh naan but then had to wait another 15 mins and by then our food was cold."}
{"text":"My review is for a quick meal here so will update if and when I visit them for a proper meal.
My friends are a fan of their other location but usually tend to not eat in there as apparently that spot is a lot smaller. They were looking forward when they heard a new branch is being opened.
I had no reference point for this area as hardly ever venture out here. I had been in this plaza for a Hakka food place nearby so kinda recognized the space.
We came here at an odd time for lunch so pretty much had the place to ourselves. The service was very personal as the servers recognized my friend as being a repeat customer at the other spot. 
Menu is your mainly focused on grilled items. I tend to order items that are hard to replicate at home and though I wasn't that hungry I decided to go with a Bihari Kebab roll (I chose pratha instead of naan for the roll)
My friend went for the Malai Tikka. 
The service was prompt and we didn't have wait much. The roll that I ordered was quite authentic as it was spiced well (I luv when ethnic places don't hold the spice back to cater to a Western tastes) Nice tender meat grilled just right for this dish. 
I didn't try my friends dish but if this is a taste of things to come I will come back for a full fledged meal.
3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals i have had, we waited over an hour for the meal to even come. They placed fewer glasses of water then ppl at the table. We asked for a pitcher of water and the remaining glasses, it took 20 mins just to get them. When the food came it was cold, when we started eating there was a HAIR in my food, and we found a bone in the boneless chicken tikka. 
This is the second time eating here and the food is par at best. 
The only good part of this meal was leaving . I will not be returning to the resturant again, even if they somehow remain open. 
This meal costed $200. Not impressed. 
There is no flavour to the food. The last time i was there the only thing worth eating was the bihari kabab. It was $140 bill last time. 

So all in all a waste of $340. Should have been well worth if it went to charity."}
{"text":"The yummiest Pakistani/ Indian food in Toronto!! They have the best Bihari kebabs and peraatha!! Naans r good too!! Usually the food is quick but last time we were there I think they were short staffed and it took them around half an hr to bring the food"}
{"text":"This restaurant fails on delivering on common courtesies - water, cleanliness (grease and dried chicken on my seat), place settings, kindness. They act as though they are doing you a favour even though you are paying a premium for inferior service and food. Severely disappointed with the poor service from the establishment but didn't leave simply due to the fact that we were meeting family here. I won't return."}
{"text":"I've been on the road quite a lot as of late, so having dropped in to quickly to take out, I did not expect much. Lets make it clear, that I am not a huge fan of Indian/Pakistani foods, and I've had quite a fair share in my life considerating: a) I lived in Brampton throughout highschool and b) My dad's favorite food of all time happens to be Indian food, which means we have it at any occasion he can fit in. 

Anyways, I came in to an empty restaurant with not one person at the cash register. It didn't take long for a gentleman to come out and he was very welcoming. He had quickly acknowledged that it was my first time there and came quick to help me go through the menu. I opted for the rice, butter chicken, and two peices of Naan, and an Nestea which came up just over $23, he even gave me a complimentary Nestea for coming in the first time. It took 10 minutes for the food to arrive which I luckily didn't mind waiting on. 

When I got in the car, I immediately opened the bag and was surprised by the amount of rice I was given. I was told it would feed one person, but it literally fed three. The naan was baked very fresh and larger than most I've tried. The butter chicken could've been filled to the rim, but boy was it delicious. Overall, It was a pleasant visit and I can't say I'd avoid eating Indian/PakistanI food anymore. Chicken was sooo soft, and perfectly seasoned, especially paired with the rice and Naan. Definitely need to come back and try more off their menu."}
{"text":"Good food compared to the desi standard. expect a long wait especially during peak hours. the fried paratha is not a paratha rather a PURI."}
{"text":"Kind of fine dining, spicy chicken tikka, oily paratha, chicken Karahi is below average. Well in my opinion they're not even close to the authentic cafe de Khan from Karachi."}
{"text":"This place has ok food but for the price u are paying there are so many other options .  They need to step up their game for service as it takes forever to get food once u order it . like it should not take 45 mins for you to serve chicken biryani, Dont even think of ordering  a take out because they will make you wait forever even after u have arrived. 

What i liked:

1.Peshawari kabobs 
2.Variety of Naans and parathas
3.Wraps are really good (better with parathas) 

Overall for the price and food there are plenty of better options . Cafe de khan needs to live up to its reputation by being organized and streamlined."}
{"text":"Behari kebabs and Karachi style Puri parathas..  The only two items I will spend on, as they bring the original taste all the way from back home. Asked for the owner one day to complement, but never showed up. It was a week day, and not very busy either..  This was a put off, otherwise the best of the best bihari kebabs in Canada."}
{"text":"I got a new job in Mississauga so I have been food ranging. I've been somewhat disappointed in the food selection in Sauga. But CDK stands out as a gem. 

It's quite similar to Indian food. Lots of spices, comes with naan, and can be quite saucy. I've tried a variety of dishes here. The lunch specials are great deals. But at regular prices I would think the food is a bit pricey. 

The food is absolutely delicious. Lunch specials come with rice, naan, butter chicken, kebobs, and some kind of bean sauce. 

This is among my top choices for lunch due to reasonable lunch special prices and great taste."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  The paratha's and behari kebab's are the best.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay, I've cooled down a bit now.  According to the website, they open at 12, but they didn't open the doors until 12:30.  Strange.  

I was the first customer in.  While the waiter was very friendly, he had to switch b/w the kitchen and serving people.  I don't blame him, but rather the owner.  

Service: 1.5/5  Okay, I still gave this guy a 15% tip, but the overall service was horrible.  They said they were short staffed, so I get it.  But here were my issues:

a) While it's a family business, the kids should not be running around the restaurant when I enter. Granted, it was just when they opened but when my parents owned a restaurant, we were told to play in the basement and stay out of sight. 

b) It took 20 minutes for my small soup to arrive.  It took another 5 minutes for my entree to arrive.  If the soup was going to take that long, they should have told me.  

c) A non-waiter served me my soup and spilled a portion of it on the table and never cleaned it up.  

d) Look at my pictures. I can't eat that without a knife without looking like a pig.  I waited for about 3-4 minutes and no one came out, so I just grabbed my own knife from their cutlery shelf (slightly inside the kitchen).  

Granted, they did try to serve dessert to make up for the horribly long wait, but I was in a rush.  I thought worst case scenario, I'd be in and out in 40 minutes.  It was like 1 hour and that was with me eating fast.  

Food: 2.5/5 meh, nothing special.  Found it underseasoned.  Paratha was not bad.  

Ambiance: 1/5 Decor is nice but all the yelling coming from the kitchen is terrible.  Ruined the entire mood.  

Verdict: If this were an older restaurant, I'd never come back and give them only one star, however I may come back in 1 year from now to see if they worked out the kinks and provide better service."}
{"text":"i had really high hopes but failed miserably. i was expecting a little more authenticity and professionalism from the restaurant and menu which i never received.

the food seemed stale and cold and I could easily spend same money at the McDonalds' next door good for 4 days worth of hamburgers."}
{"text":"Went there on the month of Ramadan..the place was full and had a huge line up..nothing uncommon for  halal places in Ramadan..the food was good and the stuff very friendly..had behari kabob , chicken karai with naan..decent place good food  okay price.."}
{"text":"One of the best pakistani restaurant for tika,  paratha,  behari.  Their chutni was to die for.  Food reminded me of Lahore bundho khan food. Specifically chutni,  behari and paratha.  Staff was extremely efficient and friendly.  restaurant had decent interior designing. Do visit for bbq."}
{"text":"Newly opened.  Clean. And delicious food.  I am just visiting and happen to stop by.  Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Really delicious food but the worst service ever. They can't handle rush hour. They keep seating people down but they don't service the people who have ordered already. I am super disappointed. Why can't I find a find a decent Pakistani restaurant that has service and taste!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant seems to have lost its mojo! I have been a regular ever since the time when it was on Dundas. Very slow service. The Jan brothers used to take a personal interest, but now they are nowhere to be seen, leaving it to up to the kitchen staff to manage. The individual recipes for their Frontier Gosht, Karahi is now a base which is used for every entree. Though the restaurant may have standardized it's recipes, and increased their clientele, but at a cost. From 2010 to now, it's a seismic shift. Sad"}
{"text":"Hands down best bihari Kababs I've ever had in my life. Kudos to the chef and the management team. 

There was a random uncle who was creating a massive scene about how he was charged for something he never ordered (BUT still ATE!). They handled him like a pro, guy and his wife walked out with mango milkshakes, despite screaming like a maniac."}
{"text":"Bumping the rating to 5 stars.
My brother recently came from Pakistan, karachi, and i took him to this restuarant.
He is a bigger foodie than I and even he said this is the real stuff.

Their specialty is their BBQ stuff. Best bihari kabab you can possibly have outside Pakistan, Chicken tikka is properly marinated and very rich in flavour (it just doesn't look spicy, it actually is), paratha is as good as ever.
One thing i forgot to mention in my previous review, their chutney (sauce) is really good, and they will gladly give you more if you need more.

Their service has improved, we went on a busy night and they had three servers instead of two. Our server promptly came at our table and took our order, followed up with us during our meal and in general had a nice attitude. 

Definitely recommended for all Pakistani food lovers, it doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last weekend. They moved from their previous location to a bigger and nicer spot. The ambiance was nice staff was helpful. We ordered the chicken Tikka legs and peshwari kabobs. The food was good a little too oily for my liking and a bit on the pricier side. If the prices were better i would come more often. 
Best item : peshwari kabob and fried parathas."}
{"text":"Pros. Good tasting food
Cons. Stingy portions, expensive pricing, poor service."}
{"text":"So we had heard a lot about this place since it's a famous place from Pakistan! It was good but not great! 
The ambience is good, seating is ok as well, can be cramped over the weekends. Between the two of us we ordered the 2 Chicken Quarter Legs with Salad and Paratha. The service time was real quick and our food came in no time, just looking at the Parathas there was a hair on one, so we called the waitress, she apologized and got another one right away. 
The Parathas were really delicious, we ordered an additional one. Even the chicken was cooked extremely well and could be said that they were among the best in town. The quantity of the salad was next to minimal. 
The place for the overall value that it provides is expensive and on the pricier side. With a bigger group, the bill could be a huge one! 
All in All, food is delicious but just more on the pocket."}
{"text":"We've only been here once and we were in a big rush to get in and out.  I let the waiter know of this right at the start and they were very accommodating in getting us in and out right away.

The food was good, decent portions and the chicken we ordered was moist.  The naan had a great taste too even though it wasn't buttered.

I will go here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"An absolute treat!!!

Went to Cafe De khan last night with 7 of my friends. We walked in and noticed the restaurant was very busy but were still greeted with a warm welcome.

The manager Taher was extremely attentive and quickly helped find seating for us and had a table ready within 5 minutes. We sat down and ordered a large amount of food which included chicken tikka, chicken karahi, lamb karahi, butter chicken, chicken and lamb biryani, naan, tandoori paratha, fried paratha. All i have to say was everything was on point!!! Food was rich with flavour and served fresh and hot. The portions may be a little bit small for the pricing but is definitely worth a shot if you are looking for a taste of authentic Pakistani food. The restaurant had a very nice ambiance and was clean. 

I will definitely be going again and again."}
{"text":"delicious desi food , lamb karahi was outstanding !!!! Better than many restaturants in karachi !"}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to my hotel in Mississauga and I went their for lunch. I ordered their combo #5 and my friend ordered combo # 3 and we both loved it. I am originally from India and I have had Pakistani food before in California and these guys make legit awesome food. Quality, quantity and price are highly decent."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and mutton biryanis 

Both lacked the flavour. Seems the Chicken and mutton pieces were just thrown without cooking in the biryani"}
{"text":"Crispy parathas and best seekh Kabab 

Don't order lot of items and stick with basic

Mango lassi was sour"}
{"text":"With some of the best BBQ food in the GTA, Cafe de Khan is exactly the Pakistani restaurant that Mississauga has been lacking for quite some time now.

While i was born in Canada, my family was born and raised in Pakistan.  We rarely look forward to going out for Pakistani food...i mean why would you go out when you can make better at home right?  WRONG!!!

While some of their other menu options like their butter chicken were nothing to rave about, the kebabs here may quite possibly change your life!  In all honesty, pretty much everything we've tried off the grill has been worth bragging about.  I highly recommend the kebabs (ground beef skewers), the bihari boti (BBQ beef cubes - tender to the point that they will melt in your mouth), chicken tikka, and the matka ghost (lamb cooked in a clay pot with fresh herbs...a must try!).

What really differentiates this place from all others is their bread options.  While their naan is fresh out of their in-house tandoor (never frozen...made fresh to order and fantastic!), the parathas are superb with anything off the grill.  Parathas are like fried tortillas...thin, soft, buttered to death and sooo tasty that you know your stomach will hurt for the rest of the day.  While i recommend the parathas for things off the grill, i also recommend getting a couple naans if you are in a large group or particularly with any dish that has a gravy or is stew like (ie. not off the grill).  

With a genuinely nice owner, a clean environment, and great prices for such superb food...Cafe de Khan is the reason you want to pack your bags and make the road trip to heartland!  

please note: all food prepared here is certified halal."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the lunch special is great value for money. However I will encourage management to improve their service time during launch hours"}
{"text":"Great food that is really tasteful. Went with chef recommendations and it was great. Have been going there every time I visit Toronto and have tried many items and had great experience every time."}
{"text":"Hugely disappointing and overpriced. 

Reading these reviews, I recommended this place to my friends, and wish I hadn't. First, the menu prices advertised on their website are incorrect - just about everything was a dollar more. 

Our server, a relatively nice fella, was easily distracted which resulted in pitiful service. And our order got cocked up.

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Qtr Leg and Kebab combo, asking for parathas and NO rice. I got rice - lots of it, soaking in oil. And one kebab the size of a crayon. My friend ordered the Malai Tikka and Kebab combo, which came with a salad that consisted of cut up cucumbers, onion and lettuce carelessly scattered on the plate, and covered with some sort of sweet-tasting sauce. Odd.

$45+tip later we left and walked over to Silver Spoon to order a takeaway biryani.

The establishment itself was clean and busy, but the food portions and taste was not worth the money."}
{"text":"Truly a great Pakistani restaurant.  The bihari boti was fantastic..  The parathas are the perfect compliment to the kebab dinners.  The lighting provided the perfect dinner atmosphere, the washrooms were clean, and I had no problems with the service.  I was even asked afterward how I enjoyed my dinner, and the waiter asked with genuine sincerity.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality of food you received and the portions were just right.  A definite gem."}
{"text":"Awesome Bihari kabab, malai chicken, and nihari!  Naan was good and Peshawari kabab was okay (just the texture on that meat was too fatty and slimy).  
Servers were forgetful, but food makes up for it.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Halal food. 

Went here a while back and just remembered to yelp it. My family still visits this place. Must say, the service was one of those memorable moments for me. When we went, they were very friendly. The food is great tasting and a bit on the spicy side but that's not that bad. The only thing I would say is that the portions are a bit small for the price. Otherwise, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best Bihari kebab in town. Visiting from California and loved the food. Good service and good food. Definitely worth a stop on every visit"}
{"text":"Bihari kebab is so good.
Naan is very good
Tandoori chicken is very good
Other items are mediocre to good, nothing exceptional.
Service is poor to non existent and orders take long time.
Definitely very over priced."}
{"text":"Amazing food but very small portions, parhatas are the best. Do try their Behari Kebabs with parhatas."}
{"text":"Other than the wait the food is really amazing . This food is close to the Indian subcontinent I have ever had in Canada. I asked the waiter and the best timings to visit is during lunch between 12-3pm."}
{"text":"Best seekh Kabob ever. They just melt in the mouth. Make sure you order them.
Courteous service
Good popular food joint
If you haven't tried, you must
