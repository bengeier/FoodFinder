{"text":"Was lucky enough to find this place on a visit to PGH. The staff was incredibly nice, food was really good and the art direction on the menu was awesome.

Loved the names for the dishes and the gender neutral bathrooms. Overall, a very cool place"}
{"text":"Best Vegan /Vegetarian I've ever had. I wish there was one of these where I live so I could have their brunch every weekend. The Gorilla Biscuits and gravy with smoked maple shiitake mushrooms are great."}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere, service. I am so glad an awesome vegan restaurant is so close to me! 
I loved the kale salad and fresh rolls. The raw cheesecake was delectable."}
{"text":"Every dish we had was flavorful an delicious. Nice,friendly, casual ambiance. Recommend to all vegans and adventuresome non-vegans."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday, thinking I would get some takeout. Heeding one Yelp reviewer, I arrived as early as possible, around 5:20 pm. I go to go in, and the door is locked. I stand around, a woman walks around inside and sits down for a bit (I am 99% sure she saw me). She did nothing. Maybe they forgot to open the door at 5:00, maybe they didn't realize. But if you see someone standing outside, you might at least check. A different Yelp review complained about service, and I think I see why. It will be a long time before I make this trip again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and unique! The service was excellent as well. I can't wait to go back and try other foods! Loved the place."}
{"text":"Vegan food has never tasted better.  The berry white drink is out  of this world.  The taste of fresh berries and the coconut soda surprised my taste buds and made me want more.  The Terrormisu was a generous portion of dessert.  I was completely satisfied despite sharing it with a few others.  If I can afford a personal chef, I would want You guys.  #1 in taste, food creativity, service."}
{"text":"I've been fortunate to dine in amazing vegan restaurants all over North America - and Onion Maiden is on par with the best of them.  The food is amazing, the atmosphere eclectic and fun, and the prices fantastic!  You MUST eat here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! I promise you will love this place. Food is excellent, place is beautiful, and music is awesome. We love this place and you will, too."}
{"text":"Very nice experience at Onion Maiden's Saturday Brunch. 

A super quick, straightforward menu: bean tacos, grits with tofu and shiitake, waffle with lemon and blueberry, or bagel with cream \"cheese\" and carrot \"lox.\" We ended up with everything but the waffle (which on another table looked wonderful) and two donuts. All dishes came with a side of tots and kale salad.

A great meal, perfect portion sizes. Not a \"stuff your face\" brunch, but a great atmosphere, friendly and personable service, and great food creations.

Small place though, so may want to call ahead if you have a sizable party or want to make sure you have a table.

Also cash only, but an ATM in the back.

Will have to return for their normal menu. If you don't like awesome restaurants, then don't come here"}
{"text":"Great new addition to Pittsburgh.  Everything I've had here has been creative, fresh and tasty.  If you're a meat eater don't be scared of this place - it's super good and you won't miss it. This is vegetarian food done right. Just good solid recipes that happen to be meat free."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend wanted to try this spot cause he's gluten free and they had some good gf options. They didn't take reservations unless you have 6+ so I was worried that there would be a wait at dinner time, but three of us got seated right away. It's a small but really cute and comfortable space. Our friend also came along with us who has a peanut allergy and they were very helpful and accommodating with the peanut and gluten allergy. The portions and prices of everything was pretty good, and their byob price is only $1 per person! Being a vegan spot we were worried we would leave hungry but we were full and content, with the bill only being ~$50 for all 3 of us. Everything was very yummy except the veggie dogs were a little disappointing but, would definitely go back to try more things!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I will absolutely be back! We were looking for a new vegan/vegetarian place to try after one of our favorites closed permanently, and we were so pleased. Onion Maiden is a small little joint but it does not lack in flavor. We ordered their weekly vegan poutine special along with a dog each, and we could not get enough. The poutine had AMAZING flavor, was not overly salted, and kept us going back for more. I was sad when it was gone. The dogs were really good too, don't get me wrong. 

The staff were really friendly and we found seating with no issue. We went at a slower time of the day (early dinner) and there were only two other couples at the tables. We weren't sure if we were to seat ourselves initially, so we definitely stood there awkwardly for a hot second. Someone encouraged us to take a seat and they brought us over menus to look at. Definitely recommend if you don't mind rock music and sweet vibes :)"}
{"text":"The food here is out of this world. Before coming, I read multiple reviews with one common word to describe their food: divine. That is not an understatement! You will love it even if you're a carnivore like myself. My friends and I all got the Bunn-O, which are fluffy warm steamed buns with Asian inspired jackfruit, resembling the texture of pulled pork, along with cilantro, cucumber, green onion and other sauces. It's a flavor blast in your mouth! I could've easily eaten 15 more. For main, I got the \"Coffins\"- a scallion pancake taco with jackfruit, enoki, cabbage, jalapeño and sautéed sesame kale. It was so fresh and flavorful! My friend said her three eyed ramen was delicious. I really wanted to try the Pandam donut, but that will have to wait till next time. 

Their menu rotates, and they have different offerings while some of the mains are always available. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fresh food with a little Asian twist, whether you're vegan or not.

The decor is punk rock themed, but the restaurant itself is actually small and pretty casual/quiet. Not loud and rowdy like the name would suggest. 

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the folks who own this place are the best. If I lived closer to Onion Maiden I'd easily eat there several times a week."}
{"text":"A heavy metal themed vegan restaurant, sounds delicious. I had the egg roll and the Headbangers Balls. Both were excellent. The menu looks very interesting and I hope to go back soon to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is so so delicious. I'm not vegan but this place has inspired me to bring more vegan and vegetarian foods into my life. I had the fresh spring rolls, \"coffins\", hot lychee tea, and a great vegan donut for dessert."}
{"text":"Rangoon, eggless rolls, and the bunnos were amazing. Days later and I'm still dreaming about the bunnos. Yum yum yum.

My husband had the tater tot nachos. The cashew cheese was perfect and the tots were perfected cooked.

The only thing that didn't meet my high expectations at that point was the tiramisu cake. After so much deliciousness I was actually really disappointed. I'm excited to go back and try their cheesecake next time.

Overall a great place for anyone interesting in plant based dishes. The service was great and the food was yummy. Come early (like as soon as they open for dinner) if you want a seat; it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Guys. Guys. Guys... you have to try this place. It's amazing. My wife and I just came to the dark side (that vegetarian life), and I'm not going to lie, sometimes I want a big meaty meal. But this place halted all meat cravings instantly. Every single thing we ate was delicious and vegan! The cashew cheese is unreal. And the \"egg\" action is off the charts. Eat everything here. SO GOOD. The only thing I will leave as a slight negative was the hard core metal blaring out of the speakers. I get it is playing to that Onion Maiden vibe, but it was extremely difficult to have a conversation while some of the more hardcore songs played. Nonetheless we are very excited to have this restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan restaurant in Pgh. The food is INCREDIBLE.  I loved the scallion pancakes with jackfruit which was also called the coffins I think. 

I'm not a vegan but if more restaurants like onion maiden opened, I would consider it!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan myself, but I don't understand the appeal of vegan restaurants like this. Overpriced food you can make yourself, decently long waits because there's not much space, expectations that you tip generously because nobody is paid a living wage... 

One of the dishes I tried was basically tater-tots, a type of a vegan cheese (the curd type), and gravy. Folks, buy a bag of frozen tater-tots (which they tasted like), google a recipe for vegan cheese (it's really easy), and buy some gravy. Same dish, 1/4 the price (or less), 5 minutes of your time to prepare it. Same for the \"coffins\" - you can get scallions pancakes that taste even better at the Chinese store in the strip district. Fill it with veggies of your choice.

Color me unimpressed, but the hype surrounding this place is baffling. This is why I avoid \"vegan restaurants\" and stick with ethnic places when I eat out. It's just not worth the money."}
{"text":"Yah, they really have the vegan thing in the bag, or on the plate, which ever you prefer.  It is really amazing how they disguise things as being cheese, or egg.  It tastes like the real thing!  If you took someone in blind folded and just had them eat these things they wouldn't even know they were eating vegan food.  And not only that this stuff is original even for vegan food.  30 punk rock points for style, 25 points for flavor pairings, 25 points for food quality, 35 points for preparation, 45 points for service and 44 points for atmosphere.  That's a total of 160 points, which is way above average.  It's actually off the charts."}
{"text":"I should start off by saying that I am not vegan or even vegetarian and so far, I've loved every single thing I've tasted from Onion Maiden. My first two experiences were via catering for work holiday parties where I discovered that what was missing in my life was their cashew cheese. I also had my first taste of jackfruit as a meat replacement in their tacos and was seriously blown away by all the flavors. Also impressed by the terrormisu! 

On this occasion though, I met a friend for dinner at their restaurant and at first chuckled a little when she said to meet her at 5 when they open. I'm so glad we did because by 5:15 pretty much all seating was taken! 

I ordered the Lychee Lemonade Seltzer and wished I could buy it by the gallon to take home! I tried the Bunno for my starter and the bun was perfectly steamed and chewy. I thought the filling was a little too sweet, but that didn't stop me from devouring both of them that came in the order. My main dish was the Thai Noodle salad which was very good and flavorful-packed with lots of greens and herbs. My dinner mate ordered us some of the poutine which was the tots covered in cashew cheese so yes, those were amazing. We were too stuffed to eat dessert,but it's easy to order it to go if you like. 

As I looked around at all the dishes that other patrons ordered, I realized I wanted ever single one! I don't think you can really make a bad choice here. They really know what they are doing to make vegan food delicious and dispel any misgivings that everything is just tofu. 

Menu items were listed with gluten-free labels where appropriate and indicated they will work around allergies. 

The restaurant is small, but I didn't feel like we were too close to our neighbors and the wait staff were very pleasant and attentive. 

Please note that this is a cash only establishment, but there is an ATM on site. 

The restaurant is across the street from a public pay lot and there is also plentiful metered street parking as well."}
{"text":"We first tried Onion Maiden at the spring Veg Fest last year, and we're so excited that they now have their own permanent home in Pittsburgh. The staff was so pleasant and attentive; the restaurant was very clean (love the gender neutral bathrooms). The food was amazing; it was almost too hard to decide what to get!  The house made sodas and teas were wonderful too. We got the Monster Mash appetizer, my husband got his favorite - the Trooper Dawg, and i got the tater tot nachos - because that had to be about the best idea ever. Also, take home some desserts because they're to die for! Love that Pittsburgh is becoming more vegan friendly."}
{"text":"I implore all herbivores in the Pittsburgh area to definitely make this a top priority! Their menu is small but quality over quantity!!! I had their war dogs (x3) like everyday that I was there. Also, the interior was super dope. I felt like I was in Wayne's World 2.0!"}
{"text":"Vegan restaurant! Good food and good price. There hasn't been a dish that I've died over so that's why I only give four star and not five. I've gotten a donut, breakfast dish, and lunch dish and they were nice. Amazing staff!"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS.  I just went to Onion Maiden's pop up at The Vandal today for lunch and HOLY JEEZ LOUISE was it amazing! (Side note: Can I swear on Yelp!?!)

I've been vegan for three years and this is some of THE BEST food I have eaten. The hot dogs are better than the usual veggie dogs that permanently live in my fridge.  I got the Manowar (cashew cheese) and the Hurricane (1,000 island dressing, kraut slaw) and I will never be the same. Even the buns were outstanding -- toasted and a little crunchy! I also got the Darth Taters, which were just tater tots but somehow still magical.  Oh...and...THE EDDIE, which is Onion Maiden's very own version of the Twinkie and hello, I am currently typing from food heaven.

The cashew cheese on the Manowar was kind of like the Velveeta you'd slather all over your hot dog as a kid or, let's be honest, as an adult. It was warm and gooey and melty and perfect. I could have eaten just the cheese!

The slaw on the Hurricane was a little bitey and a little juicy but the toasted bun held up against the sauerkraut juice as well as the thousand island dressing and didn't get soggy at all. The cabbage in the slaw still had a little crunch and wasn't cooked to oblivion like some not-so-happy slaws I've had in the past.

The hot dogs themselves were perfect. Really no other way to describe them. They had the same taste and texture as an all beef frank, but none of the beef!!! I could see these being grilled up and served at Heinz Field to 60,000 happy and satiated herbivores and omnivores alike!

Get your bum down to Vandal to check Onion Maiden out right away! And follow them on Facebook to keep an eye on where they will pop up next! Hopefully to a brick and mortar store near you........but preferably me!"}
{"text":"As a vegan I love this resteraunt, I do not have to worry about the ingredients. Very affordable and the staff are so nice and helpful. Byob only a dollar as well, fantastic place for a brunch. Love their kale salad and they have vegan baked goods as well!"}
{"text":"I've eaten the Onion Maiden's delicious vegan food at pop up events around the city, and I'm always extremely impressed with the taste, quality, and variety of what they have to offer. Everything is very reasonably priced, which is rare for specialties like cashew cheese and lentil chili on vegan hot dogs. Your order is also served quickly by very courteous people, and it comes piping hot and fresh. I guess the freshness is what sets Onion Maiden apart the most for me. Food truck fare doesn't always seem to be made from scratch and composed of the freshest, best ingredients, which can leave me in a junk food coma after a visit to one. I never feel that way after eating the Onion Maiden's food though, so I hope they keep it up for the sake of everyone on a restricted/vegan diet or those of us who simply want a healthier option."}
{"text":"Onion Maiden...such an awesome name! Gotta love the vibe...

We came here with my sister because she's vegan and did not leave disappointed. I was very weary about ordering anything with tofu but I'll tell you what, they did something to it that made it good.

They have a small menu, but I took a nibble of everything we all ordered and what's on it is actually very good. This is not a place to be afraid of vegan food. Go ahead and give it a try and don't forget your donut!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were first timers at Onion Maiden tonight, and it did not disappoint! Vegan or not, this is a place you absolutely need to check out. For a starter we got the emperor palpatots and subbed out the tots for tortilla chips. It came out super quick even though it was a full house which we loved just as much as we loved how good these nachos were. We also ordered and shared 3 small plates, the roots which is a super refreshing salad, the war dog which is a veggie dog topped with \"cheese\" and jalapeños, and chivelords (see picture for reference because I forget what it exactly had in it or on it but it was my favorite of the night....before the dessert that is.) We couldn't pass up a good cheesecake so we got a berry cheesecake with a hint of lime taste to end an amazing meal with and it was so rich and creamy, one of my top favorite desserts now hands down. Also all of the employees were so nice and well mannered, for sure kale'd us with kindness (get it?) Surely we will be back again soon especially to try the donuts and brunch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with good service, good atmosphere and good food this is the place for you. Great price and good appetizers main course and dessert. It is cash only but they have an ATM in house that makes things simple. I would recommend the vegan donuts, some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Onion Maiden! With creative, delicious food and a cool vibe, this is definitely a vegan restaurant you could take your carnivorous friends and family to.

The brunch menu only has 4 options and rotates on a weekly basis. Everything comes with a side of tater tots and kale salad, which is exciting if you're the type of person who likes savory food at brunch. I'm not a huge kale lover, but this kale salad with a creamy miso dressing was super flavorful. I think I actually gobbled the kale salad up before the tater tots--that's saying something!

The bahn mi had tofu, lentil pate, and all the classic toppings like carrots, jalapeños, radish, and mayo. The lentil pate was a total stroke of genius and really made me feel like I was eating a classic bahn mi, not just some weird vegan knockoff.

Our meal was also scary affordable--brunch for 7 people with Zeke's coffee all around was around $92 (before tip)! They don't take reservations, and there was a bit of a wait for brunch. Oh well--you can just soak up the cool, punk-rock atmosphere and maybe snack on a fresh homemade doughnut while you're waiting!"}
{"text":"We are not vegan but have loved everything we have tried! The fresh prince rolls and curry are great! Try a cupcake or Eddie for dessert!"}
{"text":"We got here around 7pm on a Saturday night, and even though the space was small.. we (3) didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for a table. The restaurant is byob which is always nice ($1pp). I have eaten at several vegan restaurants but onion maiden was very different. It has an eclectic feel which was nice, not overwhelming at all. The wait staff was kind, and attentive. The menu was extensive and offered many different types of foods. I got a hot dog and was disappointed because I thought it seemed very bland and \"soy-tasting\" like a frozen veggie hot dog I could buy at the grocery store. My friends and I got all different appetizers, entrees, and desserts which was nice because we could try a little of everything. Ultimately I liked this restaurant, if I went back.. it would be to check out their brunch."}
{"text":"OMG I just lurrrrrved the concept! This is a super cool vegan/vegetaran restaurant. Their maiden/rock theme extends beyond their name to the interiors and even the names of the dishes. They had my heart with names of dishes like \"For whom the egg rolls\", \"Fistful of curry\" and \"Terrormisu\". LOL! We went for the Sunday brunch which has it's own separate menu so I couldn't try these mindblowing-sounding dishes, but whatever we ate was pretty amazing. We ordered the Bahn-mi sandwich and eggless omlette and loved them. The freshness and high quality of the ingredients is certainly apparent. Definitely highly recommended.. I know I'm going back to try all those dishes.. and oh the Dawgs! They have vegan dawgs! YASSSSSSSSSSSS!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great new ALL VEGAN restaurant in Pittsburgh. I love this place because it has what I would call \"junk\" vegan food as well as your classic vegan bowls. Do keep in mind for raw vegans they don't have any options here but they did have a lot of gluten free options! Bring cash, CASH ONLY here. One last things it's byob so bring a bottle of wine and enjoy!"}
{"text":"All of us said multiple times that if we had their kitchen cooking for us at home that we would be vegans for the rest of our lives. To the owners: Please please please open up a second location in Brighton Heights.

Made plans for dinner with friends and decided to go somewhere new after a recommendation from my masseuse. Maybe the best recommendation food wise I've had in the last five years of being back in Pittsburgh. We got there and had to wait for a little bit out front, but they turn tables quickly and there was a really cool record store next-door that we went in. Definitely a trendy crowd lots of young folks and a really inviting nice atmosphere from both patrons and staff. 

I was a little skeptical while reading the menu because frankly I didn't know what some of the ingredients were, which is unusual for me so I asked the waitress what I should order and did exactly what she said. I ordered the cashew cheese Rangoon's over top of mixed greens as an appetizer and for dinner I had a scallion pancake tortilla filled with incredible Bahn Mi inspired spices and flavors. Not only was my dinner fantastic everyone at my table loved everything about their entrées appetizers and experience. Will totally be back."}
{"text":"Even my meat eating boyfriend loves this place. And it was so cute inside. We loved the music playing too.  The neighborhood is rough."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, the service is great, and the music/vibe is somehow relaxed and energizing at the same time.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our second time at this Vegan gem
And it NEVER disappoints! This time - we brought our meat-eating friends and they were licking the plates! The soup is phenomenal- just the right amount of heat.  The Woods, The Roots, Kale Me Crazy, the Angel \"dog\" , the blueberry-lavender-lemon cheesecake....were ALL EXCEPTIONAL !
My only suggestion is that I wish the restaurant was bigger because the wait can long - OR maybe we can hope for a second location .  Regardless, people would still  be waiting in line for the food here - it's just THAT GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Omg. After months of this place being on the top of lists of restaurants to go I finally experienced the greatness of Onion Maiden. Being a vegetarian for over 6 years and vegan on and off I had to ordered half the menu. The entire meal, atmosphere and staff was perfect. I brought a bunch of leftover home to 6 complete meat loving guys. They all tried the hotdogs, tatortots, Rangoon's and croquettes and they all immediately wanted more. 

I'm so grateful this place is in business and I can't stop raving about it to everyone. Vegan or not this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"**Disclaimer: I am NOT vegan! You do not need to be vegan to enjoy their food. It's delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have tried A LOT of vegan cheeses. I am lactose intolerant but I LOVE CHEESE. Their cashew cheese is hands-down the absolute best vegan cheese I have EVER had.

I always loved getting their sausage sandwiches at different events around the city and I am SO thrilled to see they have a storefront now! I went for brunch this weekend and can't wait to go back. I had a McMaiden sandwich, which is an English muffin with shitake mushrooms, cashew cheese and a chickpea \"egg\" patty. It was served with a side kale salad and roasted potatoes. It was great! The potatoes were some of the best I've had in a while, super crisp but not at all burnt. Nothing ruins breakfast faster than soggy taters. The Red Wedding iced tea was great. VERY sweet, so beware if that's not your thing!

I also took a few pastries home with me--a peanut butter pretzel doughbut, strawberry doughnut and a chocolate filled scone. They were all amazing and didn't last very long once I got home.

You can also BYOB-- $1 charge per person."}
{"text":"Solid food! It was simple but super flavorful. The cashew cheese loaded tots were a bit rich but other than that - no complaints! There was also very good service. I would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"My friends and I finally got ourselves over to Onion Maiden this past Saturday evening and it. was. awesome.

I am still thinking about the Burning Witch soup, which is some of the best soup I've ever had. Spicy, cabbage-y, root vegatable-y... I could go on.

I don't know how to make vegan gravy, but these guys sure do. I had the Aqua Poutine Hunger Force as my main meal. There's definitely enough to share, but why would you want to do that?

Note: this place was busy af so make a reservation if possible. They're also cash only and byob. Now go!"}
{"text":"Let me start, I'm not vegan at all and I loved this place. The Egg Mcmaiden is delicious with great texture and flavor. Not a huge kale fan, but their dressing on it made it. The seasoning on the potatoes were good and they were cooked well. Service was very nice and attentive. Ended up getting vegan donuts to go. Surprised vegan donuts taste just like regular ones. With an Oreo flavor and butterfinger flavor.  Want to go try lunch next time."}
{"text":"Went to the Pittsburgh VegFest 2016 today, I got to try them at this location. 
This spot was banging all day.
My Snoochie got a plain V-dog and a deep fried Eddies (twinkie), has an orange flavor. They said they liked it. 
I got to have this delish savory concoction the...
Kimmy Gibbler - V-dog, Kimchi, fried onion, thousand island. 
What I wouldn't do to have sum Gibbler in my mouth right now w/ extra Kimchi."}
{"text":"I just love this place so much. From the cleverly named foods to the fact that they have a takeout fridge and dessert case to the food itself. Everything I have ever had there has been amazing. I haven't been vegan in years, so don't be afraid to take your non-vegan friends here! My favorites are Eyeatetots and all of the donuts!"}
{"text":"Wow.  My hubby and I wanted to try it based on the name alone.  The food was fantastic.  We are not vegan, we LOVE bacon, but man oh man.  We got there on a Saturday, and they had the brunch menu.  We were initially disappointed, however, we ordered the crepes and the avocado toast.  Let me tell you, that may have been the best toast I've ever had. I have to figure out how they do cashew butter.  We took a doughnut to go, and it sat in the warm car, and STILL was a wonderful thing to behold. The Cronos was killer, with dark chocolate mouse filling.  We aren't from Pittsburgh, but WILL make it back.  Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Coming from a non-vegan who honestly didn't know some of the ingredients on the menu, my scallion pancake taco was really really good. I know I shouldn't complain about this but I wish the side dish wouldn't have just been a bed of kale. But oh my, my fudge. No clue what they do to it, but it was amazing! 

My biggest gripe with this place was the waiter/waitress always would take the cash and check and ask if the person needs change. I hate this practice. It should always be assumed (especially in a cash only establishment) that the customer should get their change and then choose how to make the tip. If I don't need change I will tell you that I don't need change. 

Other than that I would definitely go back for food, maybe just get takeout."}
{"text":"Wow! I am not vegan nor vegetarian and, just wow. I was incredibly impressed with the food and atmosphere here. Starting with the staff, they were so helpful and attentive.. you could tell they were very genuine. As BYOB, they were very friendly and brought us everything we needed. The food was incredibly flavorful and delicious. We went for a Saturday brunch and got right in - we sat at their gorgeous artistic table by the window. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and we're nothing short of impressed. My favorite was the McMaiden sandwich - it was so flavorful you would never tell it was vegan. And I am still dreaming about the kale salad and crispy potatoes. 

We tried a few of their donuts as well and wow. I can't get over how amazing they were - the unique flavors, especially the pandan filling was to die for. We also ordered a box of their \"eddies\" twinkies to go because they just were so great but we were way too full. 

We will absolutely be back... what a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Fantastic and creative dishes (super tasty and great attention to detail in each of the many dishes I tried), and I'm not even a vegetarian. Plus awesome metal theme (a play on the name Iron Maiden, but not really Maiden themed specifically) makes this place truly unique."}
{"text":"went to celebrate my wedding anniversary with the husband.
slightly salty to my taste but the food was amazing.
would've been nice to have 2 utensils for certain dishes =)
easy to find parking.
i would def go back!"}
{"text":"this is probably the most impressive low key vegan restaurant i've been to and low key veeg is my forté.  the veeg eggs are super funny to eat, the desserts are fine as hell, and the buns are fresh"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for my first visit.  I had recently attended a benefit dinner, and won a $25 gift certificate (called \"Maiden Money\") during the raffle, and was so excited to win it, because this place was on my list of places I wanted to try.   I knew by the photos and the reviews that I was in for some good vegan food, but what I didn't realize is that even though this place is labeled as \"Heavy Metal,\" it really wasn't a dark, dirty, screamo metal playing establishment.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were actually playing some kind of instrumental, sorta new agey, music when I walked in, which segued into some Ramones, The Smiths, Reggae, and some othe cool tunes (I didn't get a photo, but I noticed one of the Chefs had The Smiths album cover, \"Meat is Murder,\" printed on the back of her kitchen uniform (Thumbs Up for that)).  The food was totally incredible, and so delicious.  I had the tacos off of the brunch menu, which included a side of seasoned potatoes and kale, and they were fantabulous, and the tacos were great too.  For \"dessert\" I had the \"Holy Diver,\" (coincidentally named after my favorite song by Ronnie James Dio) which is the donut of the day, and today's flavor was lemon/blueberry, and along with my cup of coffee (locally roasted by Zeke's).  I had a wonderful brunch, and still had some \"Maiden Money\" left-over, so I cannot wait to come back again and try some of the other different menu items.  This place ROCKS!!!
P.S.  I was also glad to see at least one gluten-free item on the menu, and since my wife is gluten-sensitive, I'll be bringing her next time too.
P.P.S.  This place has the coolest gender-neutral bathrooms I've ever seen (see photos) and the bathroom w/urinal, also has a changing table for babies, so this place is good for people of all ages, and in fact the table next to me had a tiny lil' one eating some Metal-Vegan food with her parents . . . that's awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Lame cash only policy where the ATM dings you for $2.50 so if you're going bring cash otherwise get dinged for a surcharge."}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations a few months ago, and I'm happy to say they were mostly surpassed.  I am a former vegetarian with a healthy appreciation for vegan food, so I couldn't wait to try this place.  My meal as a whole was fantastic  The service was a little slow, but I think someone had called out that night, so that may not have been typical.


I tried the BUNN O))) as my appetizer.  It was steamed buns/bao with enoki and other ingredients to fill it.  This was the best part of the meal.  As a matter of fact, it was probably the best dish I have tasted in over a year of living in Pittsburgh.

I also tried a Killing Yolk vegan deviled egg.  I was surprised at how egglike the texture of it was.  It was a very nice side.

My entree was called Headbangers Balls.  It was tofu and lemongrass croquettes served with a slaw and rice.  They were delicious.

My least favorite part of the meal was the dessert.  I tried a matcha tiramisu called Terrormisu.  The taste was enjoyable, as I am a fan of matcha, but the texture was almost jellylike and not like a tiramisu using actual dairy would be.  I understand the difficulty of making these sorts of dishes vegan, but I have had dishes at other vegan places that managed to pull off a creamier texture without using dairy products.

Overall, Onion Maiden has a cool ambiance and fun theme.  Although I had a bit of a wait to get my order taken and get my food, what I ate was worth that wait."}
{"text":"I don't recall ever going to a vegan restaurant, so I believe this was a first for me.

I heard about this restaurant before and it was already on my bookmarked list due to the rating. However, someone I know recently decided to become a vegan, so this restaurant moved up on my priority list. 

I checked out the business page and it indicated that credit cards were not accepted (ATM on site), as it is cash only. It also mentioned that reservations aren't available either. So we just arrived and hoped for the best, a no wait.

Well, that's wishful thinking on a Friday night, as a bunch of people have the same thoughts. Maybe if we got there before the rush, obviously duh. I'm actually not sure how long we waited, at least 20-30 minutes. Which I believe was somewhat accurate to what they quoted when we put our name on the list.

While you wait there several things to do. 
1. You can take a seat on the three seater bench along the wall while you review the menu.
2. You can order a drink, or two, while you stare down all the dishes that come out of the kitchen.
3. Somewhat related to number two, you can stand in the the maybe 4'x10' entryway that is separated from the dining area by a half wall.
4. If your one of the punk rockers that is attracted to the music theme of the restaurant (which I did enjoy listening to while I waited and ate), you could go next door and browse the record shop. However, I highly recommend you return well before the time your wait is quoted, you don't wanna get skipped over.
5. Take a walk outside for a few minutes.

The restaurant favors parties of two, as there are more two seater tables than anything else. Four seaters are a slightly distant second with a quantity of about 4-5 tables. There is one table that seats roughly ten people.

We were hungry when we were seated and we quickly decided, to not decide, and basically order half the menu. We ordered all seven 'beginnings', all four 'middles', and two 'dawgs'. We shared everything and it was awesome. I generally liked the  beginnings the best, and positively loved the curry dish both in the beginnings and middles.

I will definitely return and I think you should go too, just not the same time I go."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is a better place now that Onion Maiden exists. Every thing I have tried has been remarkable. Worth the shlep if you don't happen to be lucky enough to live above the liberty tunnel. Great drink options, sweets, savory and lovey flavors throughout. Brought a doubtful friend who is not Vegan and she LOVED it. The Ragoon, YES. The hotdogs unique and interesting. \"The Woods\" ...I could eat everyday. One tip... have them heat the doughnuts for a moment... nothing like a warm sweet treat."}
{"text":"Vegan junk food. That describes my experience at Onion Maiden. If I were to become vegan someday, this would be a place where I would frequent. 

While I'm not vegan, my friend and I like to try out vegan places when we get the chance. Onion Maiden didn't disappoint. 

We started off with Eyeatetots which had bbq sauce, slaw, and mayo. So good! I'm a sucker for bbq anything so it definitely satisfied that craving. 

For my entree, I had Coffins because I love jackfruit. It was really tasty! The sweet taste from the pancake really brought it together. The kale that came with it... I need to know what made it so good. I usually don't like kale - it's bitter and just not my thing. Whatever they did to it made me crave it by just thinking about it.

My friend got the Trooper which was decent. I had a bite and wasn't a big fan of the hot dog but the cheese and chili was really good. 

Last, we got the Rose Cheesecake. This is what prevented me from rating Onion Maiden 5 stars. The cheesecake part was good but I think the pink sauce or even the pink portion of the cheesecake had an intensely sweet tang. It was too much for me to handle and my friend agreed. 

Overall, I really enjoyed Onion Maiden and plan to return!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive into a slightly sketchy part of town. The Fist Full of curry was amazing! We also loved the hot dogs (trooper, Hang Ten and Kimmy Gibbler) and the Fresh Prince Rolls. Headbanger Balls and Straight to Hell were also well received by our friends."}
{"text":"You don't have to love or even like vegan food to LOVE the Onion Maiden! This is my favorite place in Pittsburgh. Amazing food and desserts, BYOB. Tons of wheat and gluten-free options as well, but you're not missing anything. The staff is also friendly and you can hear your friends talk; not pretentious or too loud at all. Thanks OM for doing vegan/gf/food-in-general right!"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere. I didn't care for their tea, but the Burning Witch Soup was awesome. Hint if you order that you may be full afterwards, it was very filling. My daughter loved their tots, and was thrilled it came with Jalapenos. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I love every single thing about this restaurant. Pittsburgh is clearly lacking with the vegan dining options, and Onion Maiden opened just when we needed them. The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect. They have a heavy metal/punk rock theme, as you immediately can tell by all the concert/band fliers framed throughout the restaurant, as well as the music lightly playing in the background. The inside is small and quaint, with two person tables along the right side of the wall, and larger tables in the middle, including a beautifully hand painted table when you first walk in. It is warm and inviting, with fresh greenery throughout, and the coolest wooden pallet wall doning their signature logo painted real big. And the staff is the icing on the cake. Expect to always be greeted by their friendly workers, anxious to provide the best service and answer any and all menu questions. The menu. Oh my gosh the menu!!! Everything is AMAZING. I easily crave their food every other day, and you'd be hard-pressed not to find me there once, if not twice, a week. The menu options are unique, Asian & American based dishes, unlike anything you'll find in Pittsburgh. And now they are having weekly features - so the menu options continue to roll in. Seriously if you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for?! Of course I'll advocate for this vegan restaurant as I'm one myself, but the number of carnivores I've taken here, all leaving completely and utterly satisfied, mumbling to themselves after every bite \"oh my gosh this is incredible I cannot believe this is vegan\" is staggering. Everybody will find something delicious here. On top of that, the food is incredibly consistent, I have yet to be served a bad meal. Everything comes out super fast and piping hot. The menu is vast, with tons of options for sharing like egg rolls, dumplings (featured item!) loaded tots, cashew cheese plate, etc. The entrée portions, including the likes of a creamy coconut curry noodle dish, scallion pancake taco with jackfruit, and tofu croquettes served over black rice, are so large you're typically leaving with a goodie bag of leftovers for later. Oh and don't get me started on their desserts. WOW. Talk about redefining dessert and actually putting forward a quality product with carefully crafted ingredients for the most satisfying experience!!! Truly. Their weekly featured cheesecakes are some of the most amazing desserts with the most unique paring of ingredients I've ever tasted. And then all their fabulous donuts, muffins, cakes (Matcha Terrormisu!), cookies, brownies, etc. etc. etc. Everything they make is better than the last. On top of it all, the owners are truly so so passionate about what they're doing. They are determined to provide you with the best experience every time you walk through their doors. You will leave full to the brim, planning your next visit. So happy to have them here in Pittsburgh and hope to see the food truck out on the streets soon!!"}
{"text":"So good! Awesome even if you are not vegan! Perfect if you are vegan AND gluten free."}
{"text":"What a great surprise. While in Pittsburgh for a vacation, looking for a good vegan restaurant, someone recommended this strange-sounding place. We took a chance and went for breakfast -- and we were served one of the best vegan breakfasts ever: a terrific omelette that was seasoned perfectly and tasted amazing, and a mushroom biscuit concoction that was even better. An attentive and intelligent staff was the icing on the vegan cake. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Living in the slopes is actually OK as a vegan because E. Carson is close and there are options. The options are NOT the best in terms of flavour, healthfulness or quality but, they are there. 

Having this place in Allentown means we can avoid Carson all together. We are old punk rockers and love the metal vibe. Love the dishes & the fact that they change. Not big dessert folks but those are ok as well. 

We have ordered everything on the menu up until our last visit about 6 weeks ago..so we can vouch for those things for sure. 

Only sticking points: a bit greasy with some dishes, wish they were licensed, wish there were a few more fresh options instead of a lot of oil/fried foods. 

Other than these things, it's a great place to stop by and there is a lot of parking. Staff is nice, service is good too."}
{"text":"Great food regardless of it being Vegan or not.  Anyone should love the food here. The menu is creative and distinctive but not alienating to simple tastes or carnivores.   I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone looking for something new and delicious."}
{"text":"Had just gotten in town to Pittsburgh from Philadelphia. My girl who is vegan chose this place. I am not vegan but my parents are and I am always open minded and familiar with the concept. First off the restaurant is very clean and modern. Well decorated not overdone. Nice use of reclaimed wood for shelves. Bathrooms were so nice too. The employees were very friendly and helpful. I love Iron Maiden so I loved the play on words with the menu (you'll see when you go) Dinner menu was perfect sized. The food was amazing!!! You don't have to be vegan to eat here. I don't have much to say but you have to give this place a try. And was also very reasonably priced. I wish I had more room to try the donuts. Cash only but they have ATM"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fun and funky offerings here are Onion Maiden. I opted for the Munster Mash and Coffins. The cashew cheese on the Munster Mash board was so delicious. I also enjoyed the coffins, although the \"taco shell\" was a bit on the oily side for my liking. That said, the food overall was excellent, and I enjoyed both my dishes as well as the few bites I had of my friends' meals.  In addition to great food, this was also a cool place to hang out with interesting decor."}
{"text":"I'm not only happy with what I order but amazed at how creative and delicious everything always is! We take our vegan and non vegan friends here all the time and they enjoy it as well. I'm begging you pleaseeeee more Sunday pop ups or a Sunday Brunch!!"}
{"text":"Here's what I wrote to my son as soon as I got home \"OMG!!!!  It was so delicious!  100%fantastic.  Good pricings and awesome taste.  Hours are odd, so look it up before going.  I would go there once a week.\"
I live on Mt Washington and I've  n vegetarian since way before you were born, so you can imagine how happy I am that I found this new vegan restaurant 5 minutes from home!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been visiting this place since before it was brick and mortar. Always delivers! Excellent food, creative menu. Just an all around solid restaurant. Such an awesome crew of owners as well. So down to earth, and talented!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. I guess it just wasn't my type of food. I don't think this restaurant suits everyone. That said, the wait staff were kind and patient. The atmosphere was clean and metal. It was a nice establishment."}
{"text":"Another one off the vegan bucket list! Onion Maiden is definitely one of the more unique restaurants in Pittsburgh. Despite their dark and heavy metal theme, the restaurant's atmosphere is very chill and relaxed. They have one small seating area so expect a 15-20 min wait during rush hours. 

Time for the food! I wanted to try a little bit of all the recommended items. The poutine was killer. They sub out the fries for tots and top it with a vegan gravy and vegan cheese curds. I'll have 5 more please. 

Next up was the vegan hot dog (sorry, \"dawg\"). I ordered the Trooper which is smothered in cashew cheese and lentil chili. I was skeptical of the topping choices but I actually loved it. So flavorful and probably the best substitutes for cheese and chili that I've had. I was not a fan of the texture of the hot dog itself or the baguette bread it came with. Maybe I'm just boring but hot dogs belong in hot dog buns. 

My main course was the Woods which is a black rice bowl with fried tofu, wood ear, lily flower and kale. I was surprised by how flavorful it was. Texture wise, the black rice was very tough and when you pair that with other chewy toppings, it makes for a jaw workout. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. Hands down. Incredible. 

We came in on a Saturday night around 7PM. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table. 

When finally seated, we ordered the Emperor Palpatots (tator tot Nachos.) They were delicious! They're gluten-free and are topped with cashew cheese, lentil pico de gallo and jalapeños. We loved them! Great flavors. 

For our main, we both ordered hot dogs: I had the trooper (lentil chili + cashew cheese) and my friend had the hang ten (BBQ sauce + tropical relish + caramelized onions.) The dogs were incredible. They were softer than regular hot dogs but tasted just like them! I loved the chili and cheese. Just awesome. 

For dessert, we had the cheesecake of the day. it was called \"blue moon\" and it had blueberries, lemon and basil. I wouldn't necessarily call it a cheesecake, it was its own entity. It still was delicious and sweet but not tangy like a cheesecake. We loved it though. 

The prices here are awesome too! Our meal was $25.50 total! ($12.75 each and NO tax! Woo!) Very economical. 

OH yeah I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There were so few vegetarian joints but lately they have been showing up on the grid.  I remember being a vegetarian for years and felt as if there were barely any options out there..but after finding out about this place this had completely changed my thoughts! The pork bun dish was sweet and tangy, I forgot that I wasn't eating any meat!  

Not only do they have tasty treats, small bites, and delicious dishes but the ambience is super sweet.  It's got a rocker vibe to it and lots of artwork.  The scene is very cool.  The people are even better! 

Definitely try out this upcoming restaurant !"}
{"text":"Living in Morningside, it is worth battling the current construction traffic and multiple bridge detours, to get to \"the other side of town\" for some Onion Maiden.

Yes, it's Cash only. Yes, it's all vegan. But don't let that be a dealbreaker - because you'll be missing out on some of the most amazing comfort food. Our favorite is the \"McMaiden sandwich\" on Saturday morning brunch, however. It is PERFECT, and there is no sacrifice in taste or quantity of food - the \"egg\", the \"cheese\", the \"bacon\". Absolutely crave-satiating. The roasted potatoes give all other breakfast diners a run for their money. These potatoes don't even need condiments (and I'm a total Pittsburgh basic b*tch that puts Heinz on everything potato). I could also eat the Kale 'Em All salad every single day with every single meal. 

Sometimes I want to be gluttonous and order two meals at a time for myself - but then I wouldn't have room for the donuts. And WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE FROM!!! #firstworldproblems There are usually some classic favorites to choose from (like the chocolate-mousse filled \"Cronos\"), and then some surprise flavors that have cereal, or pretzels, or \"Blood Stains\" on top. No matter what flavor we have tried, they all just seem to melt in your mouth. 

The music, menu items, and atmosphere is also great for those who love Rock music, of all kinds. There's even a poster from Club Laga, for all of us old Pitt kids. Even if you're not a fan of Rock, the decor isn't obnoxious, and the music ranges from classic to metal to punk to ska. No one is left out. 

If you're not willing to go to the other side of town for an amazing donut, then try them out at Artisan Café on Penn Ave. All of the deliciousness; none of the traffic."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaaaas.

After a ridiculously successful Kickstarter, Onion Maiden has an official real-live brick and mortar location in Allentown, and it's just amazing.

The kept the mouth-watering hot dawgs (the best veg dawg EVA) and sweets (vegan Twinkies? Get in my mouth!), plus added all kinds of goodies like crunchy eggrolls, scallion pancakes topped with jackfruit, soups, salads, and other amazing vegan dishes. It's BYOB (only a dollah per person!), cash only (ATM on-site), and like all the cool kids, they have a gender-neutral restroom. Oh, and a fab Saturday brunch makes this place live up to it's super-cool name.

It's smallish in here, so be prepared. We arrived fairly soon after opening and got the last table. With the friendly staff, fun decor, and delicious cruelty-free noms, I won't be surprised to see a line down Warrington Avenue. And I damn sure will wait in it."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Loved the cozy vibe of this place.not too  loud , great music , comfy seating and super clean inside . Unisex bathrooms which were spotless . The staff was amazing and made you feel special. I talked to the owner and he was the nicest guy to talk to. The food was amazing. The Saturday brunch gave u a few choices and the tofu scramble tacos and the matcha waffle were ordered. The tacos blew away all other vegan tacos that I've ever had. The waffle was even better , super light and  full of flavor. Each of the meals came with a side of roasted potatoes that were very good and a small kale salad which was the best of the two sides. The dressing was very light and flavorful. THe 2 best things were the blood orange ice tea and the chocolate filled donut. Amazing. I would recommend this place 100 pct to not just vegans, but for anyone who wanted tasty fresh food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! This is a must for anyone who loves great food and heavy metal. We are from  Cleveland , in Pittsburg to attend the Rodriguez concert at Homestead.  The place is intriguing starting with the curb appeal with the onion logo on the front of the building and the black foliage on the plants near the doorway. Once inside, we were greeted by the friendly faces , the smell of great food and the sound of heavy metal music. What is not to love! The menu is also very creative, it looks like a vinyl record insert or album back cover, very cool! We tried several selections from the menu. As a starter we ordered the Alpha and Omega , four melt in your mouth crispy dough pillows filled with cashew cheese and served on a bed of seasoned baby spinach. We also ordered the \"roots\" salad that has a variety of greens , beets , carrots and chickpeas with a delicious ginger miso dressing. The main course, we chose coffins, a delicious scallion pancake filled with jackfruit and cabbage with kale on the side. Headbangers balls, my favorite dish, tofu croquettes with black rice and slaw, the sauce was delicious. As a side, we ordered the Eyeatetots, also melt in your mouth delicious . The dessert , pumpkin cheesecake was the perfect ending, absolutely delicious.  The menu items are creatively named after rock and metal songs. If we lived closer, we would be there everyday!  One more thing, the place is very clean and creatively decorated. The best of all, everything is vegan!"}
