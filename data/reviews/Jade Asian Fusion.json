{"text":"Great sushi, friendly staff. We always sit at the bar considering with out a rsvp on the weekend there is usually a very long wait and get excellent service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it was the service that was extremely poor. The food is ok for sushi I have tried in Charlotte so far but far from top quality. They would benefit greatly from keeping the owner away as he has zero customer service skills. I would have probably brought clients to this restaurant if the service wasn't so bad as I work for a large company down the street but would not come back even if there was a free meal involved. It's really too bad because I try hard to give people the benefit of the doubt. Oh well, looking for another sushi spot.

Took my group of 12 to another Ballantyne Restaurant last night 1/14"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant... The eel is TO DIE FOR!! It the best in the summer! So good!!! The servers are so nice and accommodating. We always go family style and get a huge plate of sushi and sashimi... It is always so good!"}
{"text":"I went to Jade for the first time yesterday night and it was really good. This is my friends favorite restaurant ever and I love Asian food so I was excited to try it out. 
My group of friends and I had Alexa as our server and she did a good job but it was a busy night and it felt like she had a lot of tables because we didn't see her very often. 
I have a very severe food allergy and because I was so distracted talking to my group I forgot to ask about dairy when one of the group members placed an order for the group. I didn't realize this until Alexa had dropped off our food and walked away. 
Thankfully Patterson, another server, walked by and I asked him about the ingredients of the sauces on my food. He talked me through everything and the things he wasn't sure about he asked the chef. I was blown away that he would take that kind of time to personally find out for me when I wasn't even at one of his tables. 
I will definitely be coming back to Jade and asking for Patterson! Such good service and good food!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but after my last lunch, I won't return.
Summer rolls........the rice wrappers were so thick and chewy I could hardly eat.  Rolled way too loosely and very tiny stingy little shrimp in them.

Ordered Vietnamese tofu.  I've never had such hard overlooked tofu anywhere.  I didn't even know it was possible to DO that to tofu.  Yuck!

Servers used to be awesome.....ours was slow and not very attentive.  Bring back the old Jade of yesteryear!"}
{"text":"Love this place - try their blossom roll, also their curry dished are amazing.  Been there a number of times and always good service and food."}

Jade Asian Fusion 

Cool Spot - Good Sushi 

Following in the urban trends of popular theme restaurants, this scenic Ballantyne hot-spot often doubles as a nightclub after hours. That was the circumstance by which I familiarized myself with the entire area. I attended a Russian party there that was topnotch. As per usual, I decided to go back to try the sushi with my divochka (baby-girl). I thought we were in a little trouble at first because of the slightly inadequate service and my mojito which contained so much mint it resembled a glass filled with sprite and collard greens. 

But we quickly got past that when the sushi arrived because it was hitting and sticking on point like as if we had been wishing for collard greens and chicken outdoors at a barbecue. The \"soundboy\" roll (tempura philly) was adequate but the spicy yellow-tail was first rate. Sit outside if it is warm and order a California red, they have a pretty good selection. It's not cheap, but what is in that neighborhood. Overall I say check it out. And if they start moving the tables for a party - stay. You will thank me."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Jade before and would rank it about a 2 or 2.5 overall. Food is fine but not great as is the service. Further, the bathrooms are are usually filthy.

However this evening I would give it zero stars because they refused to honor my Open Table reservation. I was with a party of 3. One person put there name on the list (with a 20-25 wait) but I noticed the Open Table sticker on the door. I went to the Open Table app on my phone and found a reservation 15 minutes later. I booked the reservation and let the hostess know. However she advised she had seen me with the other person, considered us both walk ins and would not honor the reservation. So we left and I will NEVER go back to Jade again. It's not with the hassle for okay food."}
{"text":"Today's visit was good!
Yellowtail roll and Ikura were both great quality and portion size, and they use the good kind of ginger, not the artificial tasting pink stuff.  I think the owner/manager was who made my rolls.  Place was clean.  I was the only one there, but that's because they were closing in a half hour.

I will visit and review this place again soon."}
{"text":"THE BEST Asian Bistro in all of Charlotte!!!! LOVE this place! I have been here more then any other restaurant in the 8 years I've been living here and it is always consistent. Great food, great service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"For my daughter's Birthday she wanted to go shopping and get sushi. I'm not a huge sushi fan but I'm coming around. I do however love noodles! We decided to try Jade because of the review we've read.

The service was good but there was only 3 other tables in use at the time. Location is great. I guess we should have suspected something when we heard beach music coming out the sound system.

The table started with Edamame. It was fine. My daughter said the Miso soup was OK (she has had better). The Rainbow Roll was good by my standards but the others said it was just OK. The rolls did not stay together like they should have. A sign that they did not know how to roll sushi or just didn't care. Either way that should tell the owners they should take a long hard look at their staff. The Jonah Roll, I believe it was, was very good. The Udon Noodle was terrible! It tasted like dirty dish water that  someone put a lot of fish sauce in to hide the fact it was dish water! The Pad Thai had no flavor at all! 

I am usually not this harsh but on top of the food being less than mediocre, we were all sick the rest of the day! What a way to spend your Birthday! We will never go back there again!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are obsessed with the Cherry Blossom roll!  Thursday night is half off bottles of wine also!  Jade is defintiely one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place last night and really enjoyed it. We've eaten at a number of Asian restaurants in the area, but haven't been wow-ed by any of them. I had no expectations going here and was pleasantly surprised.

We ordered:
California Roll (my least favorite part of the meal)
Roll (Spring Roll or Egg Roll - not sure, but it was good)
Mango Tango (shrimp & chicken in a spicy mango sauce - it was delicious!)
Mango Salmon (salmon was excellent, the mango flavor was a little lacking, but overall a good salmon dish).

The reason I'm really writing this review is because of the service. We had Sean - the GM - and he was PHENOMENAL!!! He was the best server we have had in the Charlotte area!!! We moved here almost 3 months ago and have been eating out every day because we have not gotten completely settled in our home yet. So we have had plenty of servers and not one had been in the same league as Sean! If everyone in the restaurant business could be trained by Sean and provide the customer service that he does - WOW - customers would never complain about the service they received!

And when Sean wasn't at our table, another male waiter was removing plates, getting refills for us, etc.! Like I said, overall PHENOMENAL customer service last night at Jade!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing the food is good, because the service sucks. If you go for lunch and only have an hour, ask for your check as soon as you get your food...might make it out within an hour."}
{"text":"Consistently a good choice for sushi. Not the best in the world but always fresh. There signature rolls are pretty creative and usually taste great. Hip atmosphere and a great place to have a few drinks and some rolls"}
{"text":"Our night out at Jade with friends for a holiday dinner turned into onto one of the most embarrassing dining experiences we have had.

*One member of our party has severe allergies to gluten. She asked the server for gluten free soy sauce. Server returns with soy sauce, first ingredient:wheat. We give back the soy sauce and ask the waiter for gluten free soy. He goes back a second time, comes back, and says the shipment hadn't come in. The gentlemen with us hopped into their car about to run to Harris Teeter to grab some when server finds some in the back.
*We placed an order to come on two plates for each couple. Our friends only have 4 of 6 items come out on their plate, as do we. We realize this as we start to eat and tell our server. He goes back to check what happened, and tells us the remainder of our food was mistakenly brought to another table and will be right out. Comes out about 20 minutes later. Sashimi was super small slices.
*One roll that came out later is the spicy tuna roll that myself and other couple ordered. So, apparently their spicy tuna has crunchy in it=gluten. I tasted this just as my friend allergic to gluten was eating her second piece.

At this point we call the manager over who we find out is actually the owner. So John Chin walks over to our table, arms crossed, rude look on his face, and interrupts us as we are beginning to share our experience first about the gluten free soy sauce. He addresses us with his voice raised that he took the soy sauce was mistakenly from the gluten free bin, and then he ended up finding some. Fine. 
Secondly, we share how we had to wait for half of our food for 20 minutes after it was served to another table. He then proceeds to argue with us that it wasn't true and all of our food was on one ticket. The server asks to talk to the owner away from our table (as this owner is beginning to cause a scene). The owner actually comes back to our table with a handful of tickets and starts going through the tickets AT OUR TABLE to find ours to 'as he states' prove he is not a liar. We are beginning to tell the owner this is so embarrassing to us, he needs to stop, and leave our table. The waiter then apologized profusely saying he ended up not ringing in the full order and that in all actuality he was trying to scramble to get us the rest of our order. He says he should have said something and took responsibility for the mix up. 
As for the crunch in the spicy tuna roll, owner says it has always been made that way. However, for people who have allergies this is not stated ANYWHERE in the description. He repeats loudly that it was always made that way for years, that's it. Our friends who have been in the industry themselves cannot fathom how an owner/manager would come at this situation in pure defensive mode. No apology, no comps after bottles of wine and hundreds of dollars. Our waiter (whom I felt badly for at this point) offered to buy us dessert on his own dime, which we refused. 

I have read reviews of Jade before mine that have all had negative interactions with this owner. We will be sharing this experience with friends, family and coworkers of large corporations that frequently dine in the Ballantyne area. I will no longer be supporting a restaurant or any of the chains where John Chin is the owner."}
{"text":"We are big sushi fans and this is our spot for the best soft shell crab(spider roll).  We like the outdoor seating on a summer night."}
{"text":"Definitely definitely favorite lunch place! Crispy toufu is GREATstarter choice. Sushis are fresh and taste great. I love the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll and anything with avocado. Spicy tuna roll is great too. Avocado salad is another rockstar! Love love it! I sometimes went there for dinner too. The soft shell crab and the duck dish are my fav fav dishes! Big Love Jade! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fancy address fool you, we were a party 5 and the entire restaurant was half full. We were told the wait would be 20 min. Not sure why when the restaurant was half full. I proceeded to ask after 10 min if they could move some tables together and they were able to. Well it only gets worse.......the waiter was clearly not interested in us or serving us... The food came out and things were forgotten just like our table was. We had to ask for drinks soy sauce chopsticks etc. we defiantly knew the waiter had no interest....  So sad...."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time in the past month eating here. The first time was take out and we waited for nearly fifty minutes for our food. The gentleman at the door was upset for our very long wait and gave us a gift card for 20.00 to offset their mistake.  In honesty that would have normally stopped me from going back ever again but since I did not have to complain and the gentleman in charge took it upon himself I felt everyone deserves a second chance. Tonight we returned. My wife had , \"The Signature Sushi Roll' and found it to be delicious.  Her soup, \" Thai Tum Yum Soup was ehh they used half an onion in the soup instead of the promise of scallions. Completely changed the flavor. My daughter ordered the  Yellow-tail Fantasy Sushi and it was horrible. More of a nightmare than fantasy. The Yellow-tail was smelly and tangy to both of our tongues. It was bad. Her Avocado salad said it came with mixed greens, avocado , tomato and dressing. Well the greens they are talking about is iceberg lettuce with a sprig of some type of bitter green. It was terrible as well.  I ordered the Tempura Roll which is suppose to come with 6-8 pieces and I only was given four. It was also completely dried out. I also ordered Spicy Yellow-tail which was actually pretty good. Overall a failure in quality control and execution of the dishes. This is my last time going here and I would suggest that you skip it as well. IF you should choose to go I wish you the best of luck. Your going to need it."}
{"text":"Loved the Cherry Blossum Roll and the wait staff. Also had the Monks Curry which was okay. The brown rice was dry and hard."}
{"text":"Very elegant restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a drink at bar, which was mixed to perfection! The waiter, who was quite pleasant recommended the Cherry Blossom rolls. Absolutely delicious! Our service was perfect. and though, they were quite busy our food and drinks were served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but quite possibly the worst service I've had in many many years. I typically tip 25 to 30%, sometimes higher if the service is great, but he was lucky to get 15%. Took forever to actually get the waiter to take our order, he never came back to check in us in the almost 25 minutes it took to get our food. He never checked on us after we got the food to see if it was ok. Never came by to refill drinks, wasn't pleasant at all, and I had to yell across the restaurant to him in order to get our check. It was good food, but not worth it dealing with such bad service. No manager that I could see either (at least not one who came by). Not even the hostess was pleasant. The only  person who was halfway decent was the busser. And it was a Sunday evening and the restaurant was almost empty. No reason for this!"}
{"text":"My friend and I called in an order for pickup. We've never been here before but we figured why not try it. The girl answering the phone was rude and got our order wrong. Also we got told that we couldn't pay in cash? Seriously? The 93 sanitation rating that we saw when we walked in the door didn't help things either. Surprised we didn't get sick like other people. Don't waste your time or money here. Measly portions as well, you don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"great food...clean....best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  definitely recommend"}
{"text":"wish i could give this place zero stars.  worst restaurant experience i've ever had.  went with my husband in hopes of a relaxing dinner but this place was so loud and rowdy that we couldn't wait to leave.  the women at the table next to us kept trying to move to get away from all the redneck screaming happening in the bar, which the restaurant would do nothing about.

the waiter was rude and completely incompetent.  food is just blah and certainly not worth the awful service and terrible atmosphere one has to endure.  don't go here if you actually want to converse with the others in your party."}
{"text":"Fusion joints are not a favorite of mine, but birthday occasions have brought me here.

The Korean wing lollipops were yum. Tom yum hot and sour soup was decent. Summer roll was ok. The lo mien is good. The spicy Korean noodle soup was not tasty, not sure what was Korean about it. 

Sushi is good. The King Toro roll, sexy salmon roll, and hella hot roll were all good. Not the best, but not the worst either.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Good cocktails, good food and great times!  Can be a little pricey for lunch but fun for a happy hour!  Really like their sushi rolls, they have some great signature rolls!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and the Pad Thai is great. My wife and I enjoy coming to the restaurant because the wait is typically short and the service is quick. Also a great place for take out!"}
{"text":"I have since been back and have received excellent service. This restaurant has stepped their game up and is now my favorite place for sushi in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jade several times and coming from NYC I'm impressed with the service and caliber of food. I recommend the Dynamite Roll and Hell hot roll. Both were excellent. The atmosphere here is lively and the service is excellent. 
The place can be packed on the weekend so I recommend making a reservation. 
All in all a great place for dinner in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"We went here on a nice night for dinner so we were able to sit outside, which was nice.

The food was excellent. We ordered three types of rolls and they were all delicious. They have a good menu of both regular rolls and specialty ones which is nice. 

They have a good location and I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Cold food.  Returned twice.  Owner was a weenie.  Waiter was great.  Owner was a weenie.  Rather than appreciate his clients, he showed his lack of care while picking his nose,  YUCK,  imagine the kitchen!  Bad experience.  

The owner came to our table and proceeded to tell us our food was not cold, that he plated it for us so he knew that it was hot.  We explained, or tried to, that it was cold to the touch.  Later his employee told us the heat lamps in the kitchen were broken for weeks, the waiter was apologetic for the owner and the issue.  

The owner is a real weenie.  It appears that others (below) have experienced his bad attitude too.  Rather than being kind and apologetic he try's to prove he's right at the expense of his patrons."}
{"text":"I used to really like going here, but always and still would, avoid their restrooms, they are always disgusting. I liked their fresh sushi and even some of the rolls, but after seeing them get an inspection score that was well below par, on 2 occasions, I stopped going. That, and I witnessed the bartender dealing drugs on numerous visits. The same family owns 18 in Blakeney and we prefer that over Jade, but ditto on the restrooms! Hoping better sushi and better service arrives in Ballantyne soon!"}
{"text":"The service was attentive, pleasant and fast!. Everything on the menu looked great; did a few pieces of salmon & tuna, a simple tuna roll, the dynamite roll and the Terryiaki scallops stir-fry. The salmon and tuna were tender and buttery, the scallops, could have been a bit more tender. I could sit in this sushi restaurant and just slowly eat nirgiri pieces all day long. Very generous cuts of fish on every piece!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch for the first time today.

Server was Matt.  He was rushed, inattentive and never checked on me or refilled my drink.  There were 4 other small tables dining and other servers as well.

He sweetened up when he brought the check but overall, would not return based on quality of service."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 3 or 4 star but here's the problem. We ordered Yakisoba which is a Japanese pan fried noodles stir fry. We asked if we can make it a little Spicy and so from a scale of 1-5, we asked for a 3. That's not crazy right? WRONG!

I think someone might have literally gone to hell and come back with some kind of sauce and they put it all over the noodles. It didn't feel like it was a 3 spice level it was THIRTY times the spice level. 

We did also order the Cherry Blossom sushi and it was good. 

Overall, we might try it again but will not be asking for any heat added to it."}
{"text":"Weak attempt at creative cuisine. I like Asian fusion however this place falls short. The sushi is minor league. The ambiance is cafeteria-like. The service staff is very unpolished. 

I ordered several items including the pad Thai. The pad Thai sucked. It was deeply and heavily saturated with lots of fat cooking oil. Yuck.

I ordered hot tea with my meal. I was served a cup of warm water and a tea bag. That should tell you all you need to know about this place.

And the waiters are really just a bunch of guys who wandered in off the street. Not professionals.

I won't be going back to Jade Asian Fusion for any more meals. However, I will be frequenting the cafe downstairs from Jade. It is named the Terrace Cafe and it is amazingly wonderful on every level!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of 12 adults on a Saturday evening, granted it's a large party, but the service awful. One server for our party, who was also serving several other tables...not sure if that was his choice or due to managements decisions either way it was a bad choice. To make a long story short food was good mostly sushi but some in our party had dishes, all of our orders were wrong, we we given dishes we didn't order, made to pay for food we didn't get, and everyone got their food at different times...the food was good enough for the 3 stars but for a Saturday night that sort of service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason JADE doesn't get 4 or 5 stars is because of the RUDE bartender who wouldn't take my drink order and I sat in his face for 30minutes, he even took the order of people behind me (I was the only brown face at the bar).
The FOOD is definitely 4-5 stars, my family and I usually order take-out and enjoy at home because after eating it we are tired ;-)
The Sexy Salmon Roll and the Seafood Curry are both the BEST..."}
{"text":"Fish and seafood lovers unite in eating their yummy rolls! I could eat their sushi everyday!! And I have to make a trip here every couple months since the cherry blossom is amazing and the jewelry box are my favorites along with the Pink Lady roll. Jewelry box roll has a unique design and tastes like a umami melts in your mouth. The cherry blossom is delicious with a savory finish. 
This place has sushi as good as NYC sushi--I used to live there and this rocks!"}
{"text":"This place has some real flare to it.  I really liked the whole atmosphere, it was fancy but not too fancy if that makes any sense.  The food was awesome.  Very fresh and flavorful, and the price wasn't all that bad compared to some other places I've been to.  The waitress was really friendly and really knew what she was talking about when she told us about all the dishes.  Everything was really nicely presented too, which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Bleh.

If this is the best sushi in Charlotte, my god. They only have uni on Friday and Saturday, a good sign that this is not a place that is serious about fish and doesn't draw in people serious about fish.

This is a breed of silly asian fusion for people who do not care about authenticity and doesn't realize the food could be so much better. Sure the food is served in a place that is overly dark and features neon and service was friendly enough, but geesh.

The table ordered a bit of this and that - the dim sum starter looked and tasted like it was from costco, the maki were buried in gooey sauces, etc.  The waiter referred to our sashimi as sushi, also not a good sign."}
{"text":"OK. This place is close by and I have been there at least 10 times. It is about time I leave them a review.

Their food is good and they have a good variety of \"Asian\" foods. My favorite is the Thai style chicken, which comes with noodles, basil leaves, onions, spices, awesome sauce and obviously chicken (or any other type of meat you want)

The one interesting thing I noticed about them is if you go there in the evenings, you see a lot of really buffed out guys. Perhaps they are bouncers in the clubs at night and do this during the afternoon. IDK, it's just funny to see so many big guys in one place serving food!

Prices are not too high and rather fair for what you get, which is a lot of food.

Check them out. Hope my review helps."}
{"text":"Point blank...they have good sushi. The quality of the ingredients, the variety of rolls, and the quality of the rolls (i.e. how tightly rolled, etc.) is all good. Definitely better than some of the other sushi restaurants near the Ballantyne area. The ambience is decent as well. Not great, but definitely doesn't have a negative impact on my experience there. Occasionally the cluelessness of the hostesses can be a tad annoying, but I usually forget about that once I'm a few sips into a glass of wine (decent selection, including some of my favorites that I buy regularly). However, I find it very irksome in this day and age that they have decided having a website wasn't necessary. It used to exist I believe, but now it does not. And as someone who likes to read the whole menu, I like to be able to do that before I go somewhere so I'm not holding up my fellow diners when it comes time to order. Additionally, they seem to have some trouble getting courteous, hard-working individuals to answer the phone there. The last time I called for take-out, they didn't answer at first. After the second call, someone answered and immediately put us on hold and did not ever come back. We called back in case it was an accident, but unfortunately the girl that answered basically admitted to just not taking our call and was completely unapologetic. Needless to say, no sushi take-out that night. Overall, despite liking their food, I find myself crossing Jade off my list of possible dinner options on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Many times over the past year I've tried to call and order carry-out, and the phone has just rung and rung-no answer. We aren't talking just a couple of times, it's been at least half a dozen. The food is pretty good, but we avoid choosing it now to avoid the disappointment of not having our call answered. Hoping management sees this review!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in the ballantyne area. I recommend the cherry blossom and the village roll! Great service and awesome staff. I usually always get a side or rice or noodles and there always very good. Always my go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"It used to be a lot better. It isn't bad, but if that's your standard, there are better opportunities. The problem is that dining in Ballantyne isn't amazing."}
{"text":"Jade is my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte. 

The sushi is GREAT. I have two immediate favorites that are original creations from Jade, the Village Roll (Ballantyne Village that is) and a Cherry blossom roll. I have had similar rolls across the country... but there is something extra special about the sauce they use and the overall presentation.

It is the best place to take a client for lunch if the quality of the food and a quiet atmosphere are what you need. It is never too busy (yet)."}
{"text":"Top notch Restaurant 
Great Service
Great food
Very clean, more up scale. Not cheap
But Great.
Will definitely come back ( maybe tomorrow )
We have had Sushi all over Charlotta and nothing compares to Jade. They waiters are tops.There food is so fresh. They dishes are so original.
Great Job Jade....."}
{"text":"Yucky, I am totally reversing my previous review of this place because I just saw in the paper that these guys had a really low Health Inspection score.  They got a 78 plus 2 education points bringing their overall score to 80!  I think it is difficult to get that low a score in Mecklenburg County. 

http://charmeck.org/MECKLENBURG/COUNTY/HEALTHDEPARTMENT/FODDFACILITIES/Pages/default.aspx

Due to the issues (a long list of 48!!)  listed in the score, I'll certainly not be eating there again anytime soon.

For a \"nice\" place like this, I expect much better!"}
{"text":"I didn't get the sushi but the 3 other people I was with said it was some of the best they've ever had.  I had the garlic stir fry with tofu and brown rice and it was very good.  They even got it right when I asked for no mushrooms or water chestnuts."}
{"text":"I have a bit of a spoiled palate for Sushi coming from NYC so I was excited to try Jade based on some local recommendations. 

Our server was great - an efficient and kind young man who was very attentive. The house salad had a wonderful ginger dressing and the sampler was scrumptious; however when we received our sushi mains, they missed the bar.

We ordered a variety of rolls, including the Cherry Blossom, The Signature, something deep fried and some general shrimp and spicy tuna. Nothing really stood out and we did find the rolls occasionally dry. The texture of the rice seemed a bit off, not as 'sticky' if I had to define it. 

I'm hesitant to revisit the restaurant again for Sushi - we didn't try the entrees-  but the location is excellent. The sushi hunt continues!"}
{"text":"Parking can be hard here - especially when there is no valet. I think they only do that on weekend.

Jade is on the second floor, so if you go back in the parking deck and park on the second floor, you can just walk the bridge and go right to the entrance. If you park on the first floor or in the lot, you will need to go up the elevator or escalator.

During the summer they have a nice patio area. The bar is very small, one counter, and they have one party room that is rather small as well.

There are quite a few tables and booths, but over all a very small/cozy feel. There usually isn't much of a wait time anymore and service is very fast.

I like the Cherry Blossom roll the best. 
It's also note worthy that they serve Conundrum, which is a great wine to have with sushi."}
{"text":"I came back, and the food is still great. Had the duck appetizer and Kung Pao chicken. Soooooo good. Also got a ton more of the same sushi as last time so check out the pics from the last review. You have to check it out. Also the wait staff is very attentive (which I may have forgotten to address last time), so great service too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Cute place. Great variety of sushi and all Asian cuisines. Pad Thai was awesome. Cherry blossom roll a definite winner!"}
{"text":"Cherry blossom will not disappoint .. Waiters are attentive - sushi was amazing - sea bass is the best ... Hands down don't miss this place - awesome food - price is right ... Upstairs in Ballantyne  village - great food  two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"Food wasn't terrible but the service was. Waited forever then ordered a drink from their menu and heard the server asking other staff if anyone knew how to make it. Fifteen mins later I cancelled the order."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip, and although I'm from NC, I was skeptical of sushi in the south. Turns out Jade had some of the best sushi I've ever had. We ordered about 20 different rolls, and I wasn't disappointed by a single one of them.

The one minus was that the waiter spilled sauce on my coworker's shirt, but hey, accidents happy. I'll sacrifice his shirt for some more Jade sushi any day!"}
{"text":"Always great food. Today's lunch also had great service by Daniel. We enjoyed the lettuce wraps and fried dumpling appetizers."}
{"text":"I came to Jade to meet a friend for dinner before we went to see a movie.  It was pretty dead even for a weekday evening, but the waiter we had was really nice. I ordered the gyoza and some sushi.  Based on that I'd given them a solid 3 stars. However the service, and the ambiance of the restaurant is really nice.  

I'll be very interested in returning to try some of their non sushi dishes as I'm sure they are probably very good. It won't be a go to place for sushi but hopefully since I don't foresee myself leaving the area anytime soon the regular dishes are great because I know I'll be back to check it out!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and always consistent!  Great food and great people!  The Cheese Sticks are amazing by the way and the Sushi is the best in town!  David the bartender makes some fantastic drinks and Bryan our server could not have been more delightful, kind and charismatic.  Where are they finding the staff?  I am writing this review having been there many many many times.  And every single experience the same.  This place is not just a restaurant it is a destination!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Jade on Sunday evening.  The restaurant didn't seem too busy, but we were not greeted by a hostess.  Instead a waiter rushed us to our table.  After getting somewhat settled, one of the waiters brought us glasses of water.  However, the water ended up falling all over the table and us.  Our laps were soaked.  The waiter apologized and changed our table, but that was the only gesture that was made to improve our experience (e.g., no manager was on site to speak with us, we were not offered any complimentary items, we were not compensated for any portion of our meal).  Service for the rest of the dinner was mediocre at best, and while we tried to wait to place our order and to request the check, we had to seek his attention multiple times.

Maybe this was off night but this makes no excuse to have such shoddy service and to not have a system in place to help make the consumer's experience more enjoyable.  As a side note, I thought the food was decent (3.5 stars), but I would never come back."}
{"text":"GOOD ROLLS, but not much else.

OK, Jade had 2 weaknesses right in its name: the word \"Asian\" and the word \"Fusion.\"  Basically, neither is a coherent description of any type of food.  A word to the wise: when you see either in the name of a restaurant, then They Have Won.

Next, the sushi.  I ordered a chef's sampler of nigiri.  You know, omakase (a word unknown to the wait staff), which is supposed to demonstrate your chef's agility and creativity.  I got only 8 nigiri in only 4 types.  The nigiri were meager, gracelessly cut, and tasted nearly all the same regardless of the fish.  I can remember that one was salmon (because of the orange color and a slight taste variation) and another was tuna (gassed-tomato red)  but that's all.  I was left with a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder afterward, convinced I had lost my tastebuds until I returned to the Bay Area.  I ordered unagi just after in order to make sure I wasn't losing my mind.

The meal was redeemed with some kind of spider roll-type maki made with a fried soft-shell crab.  They did this one well, maybe because of the fried element.  I guess at least I left full."}
{"text":"Lunch here was great. The staff was attentive and polite. Food was great."}
{"text":"Went for our 2nd time last night... The hostess Alicia was rude and acted like she didn't want to be bothered.  When our server Roger came over, could barely distinguish what he said, he acted like he couldn't get wait to get to something else. Place was not packed, lots of empty seats and plenty of servers, so being short staffed wasn't the reason for such horrible service.  We got up and left without ordering.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I must say the sushi is great. Service is great but unfortunately they are lacking in certain things. They have a sanitation rating of 83, which is scary. Second my husband asked for orange juice, it was obviously bad by the color. It was a muggy brown. The orange juice was rotten. Not the waiters fault but management or person at bar that did not check before coming to table. Hope they get better as I truly love there sushi but they must fix all these lil things before they go bad overall."}
{"text":"This visit was my first time being at Jade since we have lived down here. I must say, the food and atmosphere here are amazing. The Jade Style Fried Rice with chicken was very fresh, seasoned perfectly and portions were definitely worth the money as I should have stopped about 5-8 bites sooner and not tried to finish it, but like I said, it was very good. My wife had the cherry blossom and spicy tuna sushi rolls and they were excellent as well. Our server, Milton, was an excellent server. He helped me choose the plate I ordered after giving me his opinion between several dishes. I was very happy with the selection. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I come to Jade about once a week to get my sushi fix and I have NEVER been disappointed. The sushi is seriously so good, every time. I'm sorry for all the people who say they have had a bad experience, I never have.

I usually sit at the bar ad get the Hella Hot Roll, a Spicy Tuna Handroll w/ Soypaper and Yellowtail Sashimi. Always delicious. The Hella Hot isn't very hot to me, its got spicy tuna, sriracha and jalapenos but it's still very good. The handroll is good too and the sashimi is to die for. I'd like to try some other rolls but I always just end up gettig my favorite when I come in.

The bar tenders are pretty cool, always trying to get me to order a rum & coke haha. There are a couple employees in here that may need an attitude check but it's never been my server. Other than that, great sushi place and it has a cute deck you can eat outside on."}
{"text":"So we recently moved to Charlotte from San Diego where we were used to having sushi places on every corner.  In our search so far Jade is easily the best in town.  Very fresh, some interesting roll options in addition to the old standards, and very affordable.  

The rest of the menu looked very good but we stuck to the sushi.  Service was nice and the place has a much higher end look than the prices on the menu.

Highly recommend and we will go back often!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of sushi and this place by far is your best choice in south Charlotte. They offer traditional sushi rolls, including more exotic choices like young octopus and sea urchin. There are several raw choices on the menu as well, all are extremely fresh and high quality. 

They also have a very creative menu of custom rolls. Try the cherry blossom, it's delish.  Their sake menu is also fairly priced.

I also cannot stress how important this is, they offer real wasabi, not green dyed horseradish (the wasabi found at most cheap sushi places). Makes a huge difference.

My wife a vegetarian also loves this place, they have several Asian inspired noodle/rice dishes as well."}
{"text":"The food and service at Jade are excellent!  My favorite is the King Toro roll.  Also, if you're lucky you can get fresh Uni straight from Japan!  We come here regularly and the sushi is always fresh.  The owner John is super friendly and ensures that customers are taken care of.   Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed for many reasons. My husband and I attended a dinner, however the entire party did not show. I get that the party was no longer the size she expected however this was a persons birthday and this place did not make things better. When they saw her party was no longer 8 ppl they completely dismissed us. They NEVER seated us I came to eat and dance and help a friend Celebrate her Birthday it was sad enough ppl had let her down but then not to seat us at all, nor offer a menu  was insulting.  I suggest you find a better promoter because the guy in the White hat has horrible hosting skills. Also does not know how to treat paying customers WORST SERVICE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Again, if you know how to eat gluten-free, there's plenty to order off the menu.  Prices were about average, service was good, and the place was clean and welll-lit."}
{"text":"The first time I tried to order from here the online menu wouldn't load, so I called to ask if they had any tempura. The lady on the phone replied \"Tempura....?\" In a very confused to which I replied, \"you know, shrimp or veggies?\" She said \"uhhh\" so I thanked her and decided to go elsewhere. 

Just this past Saturday I decided to try again.  I called to ask how many pieces were in the shrimp and veggies tempura appetizer - she said 5, however there were 3.  I ordered two of those, and they only put one of them in my bag.  She also refused to take my cash because she \"already counted down the register\" when though they were still open for an hour and a half longer.

The food wasn't bad, but the attitude of the staff, and their lack of knowledge of their menu is enough of a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying to choke down sashimi from this establishment.  The first time was two years ago.  I was disgusted back then; the same holds today.  I will say the presentation is good, but like I've mentioned in my other reviews, don't serve sushi if it's not fresh!  The Fatty Tuna had the consistency of cheese and not butter, the Unagi was chewy and the Salmon had the consistency of boiled egg whites.  Horrible!  We were invited to a birthday dinner so we didn't have a choice.  

I will never recommend this place to anyone.  Very sad considering it's location."}
{"text":"The sushi there is by far the best I ever had. Charlie is the head sushi chef and custom made me a roll that was excellent . It's great that he can cater to my picky taste buds. The kitchen food is OK.  Our servers name was Austin... He did a great job...very attentive to our needs and as friendly as can be.  The manager's name was Bryan he came over to check on us to make sure everything was fine.  Very friendly people and great service.  Really don't care about the bad reviews."}
{"text":"I love going to Jade for a evening dinner. When the weather is beautiful and you can sit on there patio and enjoy the comings and goings of the people below. It's always a excellent experience! The food is delicious, ambience is perfect for sipping a martini and enjoying good conversation. The sushi menu is long and comes out fresh."}
{"text":"I go to jade every time I'm in ballantyne. I can't help it. :) it is very simple and lovely. 

I always get 2 salads sashimi with all salmon and seaweed. Love them both. 
My friend got the cherry blossom and loved it. 

The service is always great from the start. The same waiters have been there for long time thus they can answer all your questions. 

The bartender is delightful! He introduce me to a lovely drink which was blue moon beer with a shot of pear sake. So so good and perfect with sushi."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a Dr. appt. and looking for some lunch afterwards. We saw a sushi place we'd never been to before and decided to try it out. We got there right when they opened at 11:30am and of course we were seated and served immediately. The service was attentive and pleasant. Everything on the menu looked and sounded amazing, but we opted for a couple of pieces of salmon & tuna, the dynamite roll (LOVED this!), and the Terryiaki scallops stir-fry. The salmon and tuna were tender and buttery, but the scallops, even though cooked in a brown rice stir-fry, could have been a tad bit more tender. I would return for the dynamite roll again, and try some other options on the menu. A bit on the pricey side ($45 for 2 with no drinks), but then again, I'm not the best sushi connoisseur, and could easy go to another good sushi restaurant and be just as happy."}
{"text":"I've been to Jade several times and always hope for a better experience.  Doesn't seem to happen!  The servers are rude most of the time.  There was one occasion the guy who was serving us gave us our check but forgot to change the insulting name he gave our table.  He said it was a joke with the bartender and was not apologetic whatsoever. I should have stopped my business that time but it is convenient and the food is very good but I am pretty sure I'm done giving it another try."}
{"text":"Mediocre service. Terrible food. Been here multiple times and, it seems as if the chef has changed or just stopped caring. Hella hot is my favorite roll here, and it was squeezed so tightly that it came out looking deformed and toppled over and fell apart as soon as they set the plate down. Ordered a fusion roll because of the sweet potato tempura, and 4/8 pieces in the roll didn't even have any sweet potato in them, just cucumber and rice. The garlic sauce option with veggies and the mango tango were both disgustingly sweet. We asked our waiter and he gave us this intricate explanation of the sweet counteracting the spices, but it was all just sweet, nothing else. To top off the horrible meal, our waiter's trainee spilled soy sauce on the table when clearing our plates, and just muttered an apology and walked away, while two of us sat there with no napkins and soy on our clothes and arms. Given this place enough chances, even hosted a large private bday party here in the past. But now, Mediocre service and horrible food. See you never, Jade."}
{"text":"Warning to not go here for lunch if you only have an hour. The worst service of all time. 2 waiters walked up to our table and advised they were not our waiter and could not help us after sitting there for at least 15 mins with no water and no one to greet us. The host could care less. Never will be back and very disappointing . They said its because they were busy but all the tables were not full and it was not that busy at all. 3 waiters who are so slow -  no bar tender yes this place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice here...urban and exciting and clean. It's a great place for a date...maybe even a first date, when you're looking to make a great first impression (or any early date...the kind you still shave for...you know what I mean, ladies.)

The food is great, and the prices are quite reasonable. It's a great place to take folks who aren't thrilled with the idea of sushi, as Alessandra S suggests, as the menu is pretty diverse and there are a lot of other options.

This place has quite a bit of \"cool\" capital right now, so go out, Yelp about it, and brag to your friends about how chichi you are."}
{"text":"Good sushi, decent entrees, nice atmosphere, and nice outside view. 

Service is okay. It works. The times we've eaten here there's been no wait. (Which is great) 
The food is pretty consistent so we know what to expect. 

There's variety to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"I ate here two weeks ago.  The sushi was mediocre, we had a restaurant.com gift certificate, my bill was 3$ short, so I offered to either take 22$ off instead of 25$, or buy something else, they made a scene and wouldn't let me.  They also wouldn't take the 10$ one I had as well.  I won't ever eat here again, there are other places  to go with better sushi and much better service."}
{"text":"A nice local spot we visit for sushi or just Asian fusion food. Nice outdoor seating area with great views. Food is also good. They have good variety of sushi, also a few curry dishes. Nice portions on lunch menu for the price."}
{"text":"Met our friend, Sasi, for some Asian Fusion at Jade.  I am not a sushi fan, but upon being seated, I saw beautiful platters of sushi coming out to the tables around us. They looked like pieces of art!  If I liked sushi, I bet I'd be coming here often!    I opted for two appetizers: the small steamed dumplings filled with chicken and the tempura with vegetables.  They were great and hit the spot.  John and Sasi raved about their selections too.  The food gets a five star rating.  My only issue is that the noise level was such that it was hard to talk. We were at a small table for three, so we were not spread out far from one another. It was still hard to hear each other.   Other than that, the experience was good.   Our waiter was very efficient for the first two hours we were there, but lost a little interest in us in the third hour.  I don't blame him!   I could easily find another dish to try next time; there are a lot of great options on the menu.  I left feeling happy that we chose to go to Jade tonight."}
{"text":"Unmemorable. If I had to sum up my experience overall at Jade, it would be just that, unmemorable. To start, the waiter was very unfriendly and a bit into himself. Although the hostess was very friendly and attentive (I think the waiter should cross train). There was a really loud group of people who really ruined my dining experience. I would have thought that management would have asked them to lower the noise. I feel old when I say that but honestly, it was SO obnoxious! The sushi itself was OK but not worth running back to. I would still consider driving farther out to another area of Charlotte even though this is a very short distance to where I live."}
{"text":"I have been here few times by now so I figured it's time for me to review this place. I think this is really cool Chinese place in ballantyne. The only drawback is that they ONLY have male server. 

Every time I have been here, we were seating right way or within couple of minutes which is great because when you are hungry, the last thing you want to do is be seated. So their host is a female who happens to be CUTE! but all their servers are male.. hmm I am thinking their owner must be female :D

Anyways, so we order our drinks where I ordered sweet tea and I have to say, I was not pleased with it  then we order our entree since we are here for lunch and we don't want to be here for two hours LOL our entree arrives shortly after and I have to say it was good. The third time I was here, me and my friends decided to make it spicy and I have to say it was SPICY. 

When an Indian man says it was spicy, believe it.... IT WAS SPICY! 

We love going to this place because their food is perfect for our taste. We still think it's kind of wired that they have all male waiters and not to mention their water boy is wired... REALLY! We learned to ignore it since their service is fast, respectful (other than that water boy) and the environment/decor is very pleasant. 

Note:
I have ONLY been here for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is in a mall so it's hard to park and go upstairs but the food was fine
We ordered the candy crush roll which was way too sweet but the Toro roll was just excellent and the fried rice could have used some more stuff in it.. only some chunks of beef and that was it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and we come here often. My complaint is the service is horrible.  Slow, forgetful, not attentive to the table"}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is an Asian fusion place, as its name suggests.  So you'll get cuisine that represents Japan, Vietnam, China, and other Asian countries.  So don't call this a sushi joint, or Japanese restaurant, or anything like that.

The two hostesses really need to learn how to greet customers, like projecting warmth and a welcoming spirit.  Don't act like you can't be bothered with, especially when there is barely anyone eating there on a early Sunday evening.

So, I was in the mood for some recreational sushi, because this is Charlotte, and you can't find real sushi here, given the clientele of this city.  Ordered yellowtail, and albacore nigiri.  Both were forgettable and nothing special.  The spicy scallop hand roll was also very forgettable.  Finally, had a Cherry Blossom roll, which was loaded with sauces and looked very colorful.  It was also cold and tasted plastic.  But, I was in the mood for what I call recreational sushi -- fun, fake sushi drowned in sauces that regular people love to eat.

Still hungry, I ordered the pork chop lemongrass entree, which is based on a Vietnamese dish.  The pork chop (cut into bite strips) could've used some more lemongrass, but I'm sure it was prepared this way for the kind of clientele that frequents this place.  However, the most amazing thing about this entree was THE RICE!  It was cooked perfectly, probably the best rice I've ever eaten.  Each rice grain did not stick to each other, it wasn't mushy, it was so amazing.  If you think this is a lame observation, then you're probably not Chinese, or any other Asian person.

The pomegranate martini tasted good, though alcohol was severely lacking.  The very young server was ok, though needed more experience.  I kinda wanted another drink when I was done with my first drink halfway through the meal, but the kid never asked if I wanted another one.  He just took away the martini glass.  Oh well.

Come here if you wanna have some fun, but save the serious dining for elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Jade here, they have things can you not possibly even get other asian Sushi restaurants. I love their Tom Yum Soup, it's the right amount of spiciness to it. There's something that I always order that's not even on the menu. It's called a Volcano salad. It has seaweed, cucumber, with spicy mayo, masago, and scallops and crabmeat. Oh my goodness it's just so delicious. Their kalbi is pretty good, could be charred a bit more. And their desserts are so delicious, they have this one amazing dessert called the Chocolate Trilogy. It's a mousse with the three different layers of chocolate mousse. And they have this amazing bartenders, that does the most creative shots. I can't wait to visit their sister restaurant 18"}
{"text":"I called Jade on a Sunday evening for takeout.  I didn't feel much like cooking so I thought some quick takeout sushi would hit the spot.  I'm a Tuna lover so I looked for something that would satisfy my Tuna craving.  I settled on the Maguro Madness roll and then proceeded to ask for a couple hand rolls with just tuna and avocado (maybe some radish if they have it) The lady taking my order seemed a little confused at my request.  It sounded like she was searching for the right button to create my order and since there wasn't one she acted as if I was asking for something bizarre.  She indicated that they have a \"Spicy Tuna Hand Roll\" but my experience in the past has been that those usually have the tuna all chopped up and added with filler.  She couldn't seem to put the order in just for tuna and avocado on a hand roll.  So I decided to go with the Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls.  What a major disappointment.  Not only was the tuna chopped up to an unrecognizable consistency, they add in Rice Krispies as a filler.  Disgusting display of what could be the best hand roll on the planet.  I was really disappointed and the Maguro Madness roll did not ease the pain as it too had the Rice Krispies in it and it was covered with shredded fake crab meat.  Sorry Jade.  You guys are amateur at best.  Will return but probably only for Tempura.  I can't imagine you can mess that up."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. Seriously have never had anything I didn't like. Greeting, drink taking and delivery, order taking, and food delivery were all very timely. However, after that the service slacks off. Server never checked back to see if the food was ok. Sever assistants/bussers cleared our plates. Then another server took our check only after we asked him. Thought it might be due to a shift change but then saw our original server greet another table. Food was excellent but you need to up your game on the service."}
{"text":"I've got to be honest, this place has gone downhill.  It used to be our de facto sushi joint and we don't go very often but today we decided, since I had the day off, to have a lunchdate.

First think you see when you walk in, is the 90 health rating.  I used to be ecstatic with a 90 in school, but for a supposedly higher end sushi place in Ballantyne, not so much.  We were seating and the waiter after a few minutes comes to the table, writes his name on the paper on the table, takes drink orders and disappears.  It's a good thing he wrote his name, but would have been better showing some attention to the guests.  Needless to say the service today for lunch was HORRIBLE.  My drink went dry 3 times, when we finally got our food it had a saucer of sauce on the plate and he spilled it while carrying it so we had soggy sushi to eat.  Just a bad experience.

The food.  Not good.  The Cherry Blossom roll was the best sushi roll in Charlotte back in the day.  Now, it is a $10, flavorless roll with no soul.  I felt cheated.  We got one more roll which also was flavorless and so forgettable I can't remember the name.  We got an appetizer of shrimp and veggie tempura and again no flavor.  It's like they've given up.

Lastly, the cleanliness.  I mentioned the 90 health rating....we also got the low sodium soy sauce in a bottle that has to be a year old.  The top was caked with old soy sauce and the glass part was full of grease and just plain nasty.  Oh, and there was a hair stick to the bottom.  I would have told the server, but please refer to my second paragraph.

Jade, you're still in business because of your location.  That's it.  There is plenty of other sushi places around and that's where I'll go."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN CLT PEOPLE! Jade is located in the Ballantyne area of South Charlotte. If you are looking for sushi that is fresh with many unique options this is the spot! They have everything from Pad Thai to Vietnamese, to fresh fish! My favorite is really the sushi, such great food... a must when you are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to go to Jade Fusion after reading some of the bad reviews but was invited by a friend.  It was a Saturday night and the place was packed. Our table for nine was ready when we arrived.  The service overall was good.  The prices were also very reasonable. The appetizers and main courses came out timely and the water glasses were re-filled when needed. I had the lo mien with chicken and it was quite good. I liked that it was piping hot. I also had a spring roll which was good and my wife liked her soup. She had the Pad Thai with chicken that was a nice meal too.  Although the food and service parts of the meal would normally cause me to return, the noise level was way beyond my limits.  It was difficult to hear the person directly across me and likewise I had to raise my voice in order to try to carry on a conversation.  Even with the uncomfortable sound level, I'll still give the place four stars because of the good food and service, but it is unlikely that I will go back on a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"Jade is a really excellent spot to come for sushi.  I had been referred here by a friend and so we came on a Friday evening.  It is a great location, just make sure you dress not super casual, we got some funny looks from not only the other diners but from the waitstaff which was uncomfortable and kind of rude.  We were just wearing (adult length) shorts and cute tops and sandals but apparently it's a little more dressy than that.  We didn't look like bums though!  Sigh.  Anyway, the sushi is presented beautifully and tastes just as lovely.  They have a great wine list, and I wish they were still on restaurant.com.  The booths are super comfy and our waiter was really helpful.  I cannot vouch for anything but the sushi but if you like sushi you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"We've eaten here before and have had great experiences. However, it had been over a year since we had been. It was not crowded at all tonight and we noticed right away that their health grade went down to a 90.5!  Yikes!  We were seated at a nice table and were provided with a menu, ready to order. We waited. And waited. And waited for someone to bring us water and ask if we wanted something else to drink. Never happened. Several different waiters passed our table and never acknowledged us. After being ignored for approximate ten minutes, we got up and left. Some of the waiters were even joking around with the hostess. Horrendous experience and will never go back!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place a solid 4 stars.  My friends and I just came from a spin class at the Y, so we were still in workout clothes and stuff, but were stopped in our tracks when we walked in and realized this place is actually a little fancy.  The hostess was really nice and we asked them to stick us in a corner but we got a regular table anyway.

I had the miso soup, house salad with ginger dressing, cherry blossom roll, and the super crunch roll.  A really great meal after spin class - I was so hungry.  Also had a glass of wine...  definitely left this place full and satisfied.

Their cherry blossom roll lived up to the hype:  shrimp tempura, salmon, avacado, wrapped in soy paper... oh so good.  Definitely want to come back soon - maybe not all sweaty from cycle class though...."}
{"text":"Great place! It was really nice inside. I had a seat outdoors on a beautiful day in April so it made my experience that much better! Their Moscato is wonderful! (Thursday's they offer 1/2 price bottles of wine!!) The sushi was delicious. I'm your typical sushi eater though (California rolls, spicy tuna, salmon rolls, etc) so I don't know if my opinion will be applicable to those who are well rehearsed in the sushi game, but I can't imagine the more complex sushi arrangements being any less delicious. 

I will definitely return (but I will look for another server....I did not include my service quality in my rating as I didn't think it was fair to the quality of food I received)"}
{"text":"What the heck has happened to this place.  Went last night.  Giving 2 stars because my husband liked his sashimi.  Ordered the rice vermicelli roll appetizer.  It was soaking wet and FROZEN noodles on the inside.  The piece of shrimp wax hardly recognizable.  Either very old, frozen cooked, or something weird. The Tum Yum soup was unremarkable-just take it off the menu.  I love super spicy things but this had something in it that was irritating and made me cough with every sip. Had the big tuna roll which was very small with paper thin slices of tuna and avocado.  Very tiny.  Service was so so at best.  When we arrived we were told they were out of hot sake (which was fine, we don't drink it,) but when I wanted hot tea after dinner they were out of that???  What the heck?  My thoughts all night.  I've given up on this place."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Charlotte! The setting is classy and the service is fantastic. My favorite sushi is the pink lady (pictured). It's a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite sushi place. I love a lot of their sushi, their noodles, fried rice, appetizers, etc. I've been going here for a few years and every time I come here, no matter what I get from the menu, it's been really good. 

Here are a list of my all time favorite:
-Veggie & tofu Pad Thai
-Veggie &tofu fried rice
-Spicy Salmon Sushi
-Miso Soup
-Beef Negiyaki"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The sushi is the best I have ever had, the bartender Alex was very attentive, he let me know about the drink special, recommended a few sushi rolls and they were great! Best service in ballantyne!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night and I was very disappointed.  The food was average, but the service left me thinking this restaurant was much worse than it most likely was.  When I first sat down, I was excited about the dinner.  The deck view was great, the hostess was friendly, and the waiter was at the table with water almost immediately, but things went downhill after that.  I ordered the calamari app and noticed immediately there was a pubic hair in the middle of the peppers.  After waiting for over 5 minutes for the waiter to come back, I asked another waiter to go and find him.  When he came back and I showed it to him, he pulled it out, inspected it, said \"hmm\" and walked off without an apology.  The sushi, which was ordered at the same time as the app, took over 30 minutes to get to the table and it was average.  When the check came, the waiter dropped it off, and once again never apologized about the pubic hair.  When he came to get my card, I jokingly asked him if there was not some sort of discount for having to deal with that and he looked at me very seriously and said \"yes, I took off the app\".  I was shocked and when he came back with the bill, he let me know that the manager gave me a 10% discount and took off the app.  At this point I was ready to leave, but I did point out that I didn't eat any of the app because it had a pubic hair, not a regular hair, in it so that was to be expected.  As I stated, the food was average, but the slow and service and lack of apology and concern made this much worse."}
{"text":"I really LOVED my sushi dinner here, and it will be my go-to spot in South Charlotte. We tried four rolls; Volcano, Super Crunchy, Cherry Blossom, and the Pink lady. The standouts were the Cherry Blossom and Volcano. I also had a Jade Crispy Roll (their version of a spring roll) and it was tasty. The prices were very reasonable for sushi, and the restaurant was clean and really quite lovely. Our server was efficient and friendly. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was average, service below average.  Will not visit again.  $75 meal, very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I come here for their Cherry Blossom Roll and seaweed salad. It is so delicious! I also love their gyozas and miso soup. They have good \"modern\" sushi. The price of their food is great and affordable. However, I prefer to take out rather than dine in because their service is below average. I think the owner waited on my table last night I dined in and he was friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here for New Years Eve...and it was INCREDIBLE. The experience was stellar. My wife had a few sushi rolls- including the Ballantyne & Tempura. I had the Jade Style Angel Hair. Everything was amazing. Go early, avoid the wait. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hello Lady!  After reading the other reviews which noted that the wait staff were all \"bouncers from a club\" or male fitness models, I didn't think it would persist.  I was wrong, this is a great place to take a bachelorette party to start off the night.  It was loud since the bar area was very close to the dining area, but we weren't there for a quiet dinner.  This is located in the Ballantyne shopping area where you can see a movie, multiple dining options, and park in the huge parking deck.  So not bad.

The sushi - the first thing I noticed were that MOST of the specialty rolls were filled with \"Spicy tuna/salmon/etc.\" where they mix the fish with hot sauce and mayo.  Not my style as I want the real deal.  Don't get me wrong, they had some rolls with the fish on top, but we had to try at least the regular tuna roll.  At least the day we went, the tuna felt too chewy, not melt in your mouth.  Maybe this was a sign of freshness, or lack thereof.  Overall, the rolls were tasty and ok-priced for the ambience.  I assume the Spicy-treated sushi makes up for the lower price.

I enjoyed it there, but I'm not loving all the selection.  I would bring a larger group of friends for a nicer dinner for casual sushi that won't break the bank.  Don't fret, 3-stars is still good!"}
{"text":"I go here for a quick lunch most days when I am in this area. I love the outdoor seating on a pretty day and also love sitting at the bar if it is a bit more crowded. There is always space to lay my work out which is nice! I love the cherry blossom roll which is a staple for most sushi restaurants. 

The service is always quick and friendly at lunch and they know how to cater to people on a lunch break! I haven't been at night for dinner service do I can't add anything on crowds, service or speed but overall a wonderful lunch place!"}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review about a place ever but after leaving this restaurant I was so infuriated that I felt the need to share about how awful this place was. I would give this place 0 stars if that was even an option. It doesn't even deserve the one star that I was forced to give it!
    First of all the entire wait staff is extremely creepy and we watched the waiters (who basically look like Chip N Dales) hit on several different groups of girls sitting at tables around us and our waiter was trying to flirt with my sister and I which both made us extremely uncomfortable.
      We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting. The squid was rubbery and I could barely bite into it and the the outer breading tasted exactly like the breading on the crappy frozen fish sticks that your mom used to make you eat as a kid. After being extremely disappointed with the appetizer we ordered some sushi. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and my sister ordered a spicy tuna roll. The sushi came out and had a really cool presentation, my shrimp roll looked like a dragon and my sisters sushi looked delicious. There was even 2 pieces of salmon nigiri on the plate that we did not order so we thought it was included or was a bad attempt of hitting on us by our waiter. My sister enjoyed her sushi and the nigiri but my roll tasted like it had been sitting out for quite awhile and had a really displeasing texture.
     For our entrees my sister and I both ordered pad Thai with shrimp. The waiter brought it out and I kid you not it smelled exactly like vomit. I even made a comment to my sister that it smelled off and she even said it smelled like someone had thrown up on her plate. The dish was okay, I've had way better but it was lacking and it didn't even have peanuts. After we had asked another waiter to bring us boxes since our waiter was nowhere to be found, he finally reappeared again bringing us the peanuts that were supposed to be served with the pad Thai....after we were finished eating!!!!! 
     The reason why I'm writing this review is not for the crappy food but for our idiotic waiter who brought us the check almost 20 dollars over what we actually purchased. On the bill it said we had ordered a \"white dragon roll\" a \"sexy salmon roll\" and 2 pieces of salmon nigiri. We asked our waiter to fix the bill because we had not ordered any of those things and his response was \"oh I think I made a mistake and mixed your sushi order with another table's order\" we asked if he could fix the bill and he chuckled and said \"well you see the thing is..you guys ate it so..\" I was FURIOUS how would we have known that's not what we ordered if we had never been there before. I told him that I would not pay for his mistakes and he reluctantly said he would see what he could do about it. The restaurant was pretty empty so it's not like there even was a legitimate reason for his mistake. Several minutes later he returned and told us he removed the sexy salmon roll and the nigiri but left the white dragon roll. He was extremely rude, unapologetic and was clearly pissed that he had to even come back out to bring the check to us. The manager didn't even come out to apologize. If our waiter had simply said I'm so sorry this happened I'll fix it right away I wouldn't even bother with this review but he acted like it was our fault that we got the wrong sushi. I will never ever return to that god awful place for as long as I live even if someone was holding a gun to my head. Do not eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! I have dined here before and enjoyed the food,  and decided to bring my family there to try it as well. Arrived early (5:45) on a Saturday, and while there were roughly 4-5 small tables of patrons being served,  we were turned away because we didn't have reservations.  Not like we had a large party,  there were 5 of us.  Hostess was rude,  the restaurant was dead,  and this poor service is likely the reason why.  What a joke!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have come across in Charlotte since leaving New York, which is a pretty bold statement. If you go here, you have to order the cherry blossom roll, it is fantastic. It's nice here because if you are with some people who maybe aren't into sushi, they have a ton of other dishes to choose from since it's asian fusion style. I've been here twice so far and have sampled a decent amount of rolls and starters, and you really can't go wrong. For all you tofu fans, get the crispy tofu to start - very good. 

The inside decor is really cool, and they have an outdoor seating area as well. If you dine outside you can hear the music from the village bistro downstairs, which is great if they have live music (they normally do.) Only one small glitch when we were there the last time: it was during the week, they had free tables but told us we still had to wait twenty minutes, because they didn't have enough servers. They didn't expect it to get as busy as it did, which actually isn't really a bad thing! 

PS -- they have a private room for parties or meetings with a big flat screen mounted on the wall."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the other food but the sushi was very average. The cap'n crunch role was my favorite out of the 3 I ordered. The fish seemed a little dried out and not super fresh. The order came to about $35, so at $12 per roll, I wouldn't say it was worth it.

The outdoor seating seemed nice for a warm summer evening, but it was full."}
{"text":"As a sushi connoisseur, I believe Jade serves some of the best sushi in Charlotte. It is fresh and has exceptional flavor--however, it is also a tad pricey. Even still, the cost is worth it, as their cherry blossom rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure how this place only has 3 stars. While in Ballentyne on business I ate here twice. The service is extremely friendly and the sushi is some of the best I've had, and I've had amazing sushi in NYC, LA, Vegas, and even Asia. Great sushi among other menu items and awesome wine, cocktail and saki selection. Definitely recommend if you're in the Ballentyne area. Plus outdoor seating! 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 on Saturday night.  They were slammed, but we had no issues, no wrong orders or delays.  Waiter was very upbeat and attentive.  Very impressed.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Horribly inattentive service. Our waiter saw we had a toddler and basically treated us like we were second class citizens! Our son is actually well behaved in restaurants too - so it was unjustified! We ordered food for him, a couple of appetizers and some sushi rolls....  We wanted more sushi but he never came back to check on us. Our waters were empty and ice melted, sons plate was clean and we were twiddling our thumbs when the busser realized we were finished and sent waiter over - no questions asked, dropped check and ran off again. Busser took credit card and gave to waiter and we never saw that guy again.... Weird. No thanks - I will stick with sushi 101, they're attentive and much cheaper. Not to mention, parking is no where near as difficult - hope Jade gets it together."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with some co-workers and I am in love.  Sushi was fresh and very yummy.  I want to go back everyday!!  Location is also very cool and there are other things you can check out after dinner!"}
{"text":"An awesome sushi experience! Very diverse menu and great eel!"}
{"text":"The general consensus of 3.5 stars is about right for Jade.  That's exactly what I'd rate them if it were an option, but a 3 is too low when you factor in their excellent service, great atmosphere (indoor and outdoor), and timeliness (esp during lunch when most of the customers have to get back to work).  Plus, there really aren't too many better sushi spots in town and Jade is probably the best in Ballantyne.

I've only eaten one non-sushi item and... well it sucked.  Even though the server told me it was a good choice.  But some of their sushi is pretty good.  My favorite is The Rescue roll - I can't remember what's on the inside (spicy tuna I think), but it has fresh White Tuna and avocado on top drizzled with some kind of spicy mayo.  It's the reason I keep going back (but if I didn't work in Ballantyne I honestly probably wouldn't).  When all is said and done - The Terrace Cafe is the best restaurant in The Ballantyne Village."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. On one hand, my dining partner and I really enjoyed the four rolls we got, but on the other hand, we were hard pressed to find something that wasn't fried, covered in tempura flakes, or stuffed with tempura coated protein. We ordered the 4 seas naruto, the samurai, the super crunchy, and the cherry blossom. The thing I liked about Jade was that the chefs take a common concept but change maybe one or two things about the roll to make it just a tiny bit different.  I really appreciated the 4 seas naruto: it was four types of seafood wrapped in a thin layer of cucumber with no sticky rice. It was clean and refreshing. I think I probably could've eaten eleventy billion of those pups. The samurai was pretty commonplace but with the traditional tobiko replaced with black caviar. The super crunchy, well, we've had a million super crunchies by now, but I liked the fact that it was coated in crisp rice in place of panko or tempura flakes. The cherry blossom was recommended to us by our server, but we ultimately decided it didn't really feel like sushi. I liked that it was wrapped in soy bean, but other than that, it seemed way too safe.

I wouldn't necessarily say I'm a sushi purist, but I am growing a little concerned that sushi in the South is becoming synonymous with tempura and fried (but then again, doesn't the South pride itself on frying EVERYTHING?).

One thing I'd recommend trying here is the Fuji Moon. It's a Blue Moon with a splash of apple sake. Beer+sake usually means my college drinking buddies and I are up to no good, but this beverage was really comforting during our late night bite.

So, today Jade Asian, I'll give you 3 stars. I'd give you 4, but I'm pretty stingy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here and the service is good. The food was mediocre. I have had much better. I think it's a little over rated. I had the dynamite roll, which was good but very small and just not that special for the price. And we also had the shrimp pad Thai which was so salty I still have a headache. I'm usually not very critical but I have a thing for good Asian food and this just didn't really make the cut."}
{"text":"Always excellent service and great food.  Elegant atmosphere that is great for a date night, but also relaxed enough to bring kids.  One of our family's favorites... probably come here every other week.  King Toro is the best."}
{"text":"Food consistently good.  Dining room service is hit & miss.  Not sure what the problem is, but service for groups of more than 4 are a problem.  Tonight was my fourth time with a larger group & service was not as good as when I am there w/a smaller group.  Unfortunately, it's been like that every time...
I'll be back, but with a smaller group of people."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review, after having a not so great sushi experience at another nearby restaurant. But anyhoo, I have been coming to Jade on/off for the past 4 years. Excellent quality food, good service, and nice atmosphere. 

I've come here on dates, after-work outings, and to catch up with friends and family. Can't say I've ever been disappointed (especially with the food) during any of those visits. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Tucked in the mythical spaceship complex in Ballantyne is Jade, on the second floor. It's not flashy, it's not modern, it's not fancy, it's just a nice sushi place. And the food certainly reflects the decor.

Overall, Jade is good, and I'd definitely recommend it for a more \"upscale\" sushi place. They have a good selection of sushi (some of it IS pretty unique, like the Dragon's Egg, which is a big rice ball with some sushi-like things in it), and the quality is pretty good as well. I've never had a problem with service either, but it's just missing that one special something to propel it to 5 stars. 

I will say that the outside seating is nice, and the string lights that hang down from the patio are a wonderful touch. I'd tell you what I recommend from their menu, but I can't access their website for some reason? Maybe someone should get on that...."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here tonight.  While our waiter was fine, it is obvious that the owner does not value customers who have been coming to his restaurant weekly for over 4 years.  After watching him following his waitstaff around taunting and yelling at them, he decided to change his policy of accepting the Ballantyne discount card.  The table next to us used their card and the owner got mad and said that the waitstaff have been allowing the card on weekends when that is not his policy.  When we tried to use our card he then said we were not allowed.  When we complained he walked away from us mid sentence .  It is no wonder that all of the regular waitstaff have quit. We will NEVER return."}
{"text":"***WARNING*** 
THIS PLACE IS DIRTY. DO NOT EAT HERE. 

Went in with my family tonight and walked out before the appetizers came! 

Right above the hostess stand, I saw that 90% health grade hanging on the wall (if you don't know, 90% is SUPER LOW!). At that point, everyone was coming and it would have been too difficult to have everyone change restaurants at this point so I said screw it and went for it. I just wasn't going to order any sushi, that's for damn sure haha!

We sat down in the completely empty restaurant and my brother ordered a hot tea and we ordered a couple appetizers. His tea came in a completely disgusting cup that was covered in dirt and grime which he did not realize until he poured his second glass. So much grime that he wiped his finger across the inside of the cup and a very noticeable amount of black dirt was on his finger. 

I then looked at the stack of small plates that were put out for the appetizer. They were all covered in a brown goo. 

Needless to say, we walked out before they were able to say anything."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food had great portions. OLD DISHES, DATED INTERIOR. Our plates were scratched and chipped from being overused. The long dish that had a specialty roll had a crack in the middle."}
{"text":"The best sushi roll in Charlotte can be found here. It is called the King Toro Roll. It melts in your mouth. The Cherry Blossom, the establishments signature roll, is awesome as well.

But if you go here, you will be doing yourself  disservice if you miss the King Toro Roll. It is $15.95, and the price point made me pass it up a couple of times. Then I tried it. Amazing. If they raised the price to $30, I would still buy it.

The spot is perfect for lunch if you work in the Ballantyne area, and a great place to go on a date. The interior reminds me somewhat of a upscale restaurant in the 60's.

If there are non-sushi fans in your group, they offer a menu full of alternative foods with a little bit of everything you would expect from an Asian fusion type establishment

If you go and try it, just remember to thank me later!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Jade!  95% of the time we just do take-out because of the three little ones at home, and they always do an awesome job!  They package everything up perfectly and always make sure you have enough chop sticks, soy sauce, wasabi, ginger, ect....


When it comes to maki rolls, they have always been well prepared and very fresh tasting!  We've never had an issue with quantity or quality!  The Cherry Blossom is my favorite!!

We've dined at the restaurant a few times and always had a good experience.  Yes the servers are all males but I don't have a problem with that.  I'm sure if my better half was writing this review he might be writing something else!  ;)"}
{"text":"We dined here on a Saturday night and we suggest a reservation. We had the scallops,ahi tuna and shrimp appetizer. My husband had sushi as his main course and I had the Szechuan scallops as a main entree which is offered low carb! Everything was cooked to perfection and  the waiters were attentive but not over bearing. The liquor drinking are a bit costly but overall a great meal at a good price. The atmosphere was nice and I can see this being a great place to visit during the spring and summer months to enjoy the patio dining. A great area to see a movie at the Ballantyne movie theatre and eat dinner!"}
{"text":"Jades has the worst service. They're really slow , they never fill up your drink and the food takes forever to bring out. The only good thing about them is that only the sushi is good ."}
{"text":"I've never tasted better sushi. I love the Lady in Pink roll and my daughter loves the Cherry Blossom roll. Pair it with a side of fried rice and Jade's delicious spicy mayo. To die for!"}
{"text":"I ordered jade special fried rice, it is good. Sushi plate also good.. the only thing is we sat outside and we had to wait for the menu, water, our food for everything. 
And once food received, they didn't serve with hot sauce so we requested one.. and omg it took like forever to come. I asked waiter why it took this much time he said , they were making hot sauce in the kitchen.. I am amused.. anyways but it taste good. So no complaint about taste, it's just if I would have gotten the food in time, could have enjoyed more at right temperature."}
{"text":"I usually do not write restaurant reviews...I usually decide that I will no longer patronize the restaurant.  But I am still upset days later, so I feel the need to write a review.  I have been going to Jade, eating in and getting carryout, for 10 years.  We come here so often the hostess know us by name.  I visited 10-18-17 and requested to sit outside, as it was a beautiful night.  It took about 15 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge that we were waiting.  The waiter came over with 2 glasses of water and then proceeded to take our drink order.  We already know what we want so we did not hesitate to give him the drink order and food order.  He left as though he was going to grab our drink order.  About 5 minutes pass and another couple is seated outside next to us.  We are now sitting at the table without drinks for at least 20 minutes.  The waiter promptly greets them and commence to taking their drink order.  The waiter then comes back about 5 minutes later with wine and a soft drink for the table next to us.  We are thinking that our hot sake has to be on the way.  We are now sitting at the table without drinks for at least 25 minutes.  The waiter never looks our way and we never got our drink order.  I know he is aware we requested hot sake because we had a conversation about other sake they have, but we told him we wanted the hot sake.  In my mind, there should be no doubt that we ordered hot sake, but for some reason he did not feel the need to fulfill our order.  

We were waiting at least 30 minutes and I was upset, so we decided to leave.  We walked past the waiter and he did not even acknowledge we were leaving.  My husband had to turn to tell him he's a horrible server.  I would like to go back to Jade, but I don't know how they could hire such a horrible waiter in such a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Another #Yelps10FirstsCLT visit today. I went into Jade just before they closed for lunch at around 2pm. When I walked in it was practically empty. But there were a few people at the bar and the hostess came right over to assist me. She was friendly and gave me a menu as I ordered. I couldn't decide between the Sesame or Teriyaki stir fry dish so I asked her which was better to help me out. Her response... \"Well the Sesame is fried and Teriyaki is a sauce\"....... *blank stare*...... Really? smh I got the Teriyaki Beef since I also ordered the Fried Calamari. 15 minutes later my food was ready and I headed back to the office to eat. 

I started with the Calamari. They looked so delicious and crispy the way I like it and Fried Calamari is my favorite starter at any restaurant. I dipped in the Sauce and took a bite.... all I could taste was chewy bread. Upon further inspection it was either horrible Calamari or it was overcooked because inside that thick crispy coating (Which was VERY good by the way), was a super thin string of super chewy Calamari. I couldn't believe it. I'd never seen Calamari look like this, the worst yet. So basically that was a COMPLETE waste of money. I'd definitely stay away from that.

On to my lunch entree, which after the Calamari I was very skeptical of, especially since they put my egg roll directly on top of my rice, resulting in a soggy egg roll. That was disappointing, but my Teriyaki Beef was the best i've had at a restaurant. Oh my goodness, they don't need to change that recipe EVER. Not often do you go somewhere and order the Teriyaki and they actually season the meat with something other than salt as well as adding some of the best Teriyaki sauce, but they did. I could eat it all day. I'm struggling with rating this place a 4 because I really feel like a 3. I'll come back and try the Sushi which will hopefully redeem them. Though i'll definitely be returning often for the Teriyaki for lunch."}
{"text":"Jade used to be great....had lunch there today and was extremely disappointed!  The server was terrible! He brought out the wrong dish, never checked back, and kept forgetting things we asked for! What is more bothersome is that they weren't even busy! Only about 4 tables in the whole place. I had to get up to get water for our table. Twice! You can't serve spicy food and not refill drinks! Plus we told him we were in a rush and the meal still took about an hour and a half! Thanks for making me late for my meeting Jade. 
I won't be back so no worries of that happening again. Good luck."}
{"text":"This place will disappoint.  Ordered take out, got home, item for was missing.  Called in and asked for refund on that item, they said we can do that, but can give store credit.  Most people don't want store credit for a place that just messed up their order.  What was left of the order was not the quality you'd expect for the price. 
Service has been going down hill for years.  They've reached a new low."}
