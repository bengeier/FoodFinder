{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing impressed me, but tasted ok. There was something
Missing... Food had almost no taste at all!!! My miso soup was ok but tasted like If it was canned miso soup. The Salad and dressing were good. Main course was sizzling chicken and it was sizzling!!! The plate was soo hot it fumed in my face for so long that I had to wait to start eating. So hot that the bean sprouts were all burnt at the bottom, and it gave the whole
thing a light taste of burnt food. Waitress was polite but was busy talking with her old mom sitting at a table, and forgot to bring over the drinks we ordered... Well, overall it's a big 2 stars I'm giving them. If I was very hungry and no other restaurant around, I would eat there again. But I won't go back."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi for delivery a couple times. There is nothing wrong with the food its fine. Nothing too special, atleast the sushi isnt. Would still reccomend."}
{"text":"The best part of the soup was the broth! The cuts of meat were alright and noodles were good. 

Service was great! Our server was attentive. Refilling our water, and informed us right away if certain dishes couldn't be could not be made due to lack of materials."}
