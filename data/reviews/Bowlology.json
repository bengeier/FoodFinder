{"text":"I really like this place I'm really into healthy eating and living...I had the Makai bowl and it was delicious and fresh..Very clean store and friendly people. Check it out"}
{"text":"I really wanted a poke bowl and intended to go to the place directly next to Bowlology, but since they were closed, I figured I'd give Bowlology a try. I got their 'OG' poke bowl which is a basic tuna, rice, and seaweed salad bowl with some ponzu. It was $12, and my fish had a ton of bones in it and was drowned in so much soy sauce I could have been eating tofu and not known the difference.   Overall I'm pretty bummed that I spent $12 on what was mostly just a lot of rice swimming in sauce. I might go back and try their acai bowls, but definitely don't order their poke."}
{"text":"I was stuck at the office so decided to order in lunch. I wanted to try something different and was intrigued with Bowlology's menu. I contact Postmates and ordered the SPICY SHOYU bowl.  After a few minutes I received a decline notice from Postmates telling me Bowlology was too busy to fill my order.  Really?"}
{"text":"Bowlology definitely has the best acai in Vegas. I love the makai bowl because it's really thick."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful ahi bowls.  The fruit may be good, but STAY AWAY from the protein.  Ahi was completely fishy smelling, everything was too heavily salted, and the day old rice was hard and stale.  YUCK.  NOT WORTH $11.00"}
{"text":"I ordered a large Makai and actually got a granola bowl with acai. It was FULL of granola which made it very dry, almost like cereal without milk. I love pineapples but they were out?!? The strawberries were DICED so tiny they were cute. After I asked for an extra cup to dump out the ton of granola I was able to eat it."}
{"text":"I always come here for the acai bowls. The hours sometime isn't very convenient for me but i do make the effort to come here. The portions are generous if you get the large one. 32 oz for 9.49 is not bad. I really like their hula bowls and it never disappoints. Definitely worth a try if youre in the unlv area. Located in the same shopping center as cafe rio and the book store."}
{"text":"Disappointed in customer service. The cashier was so moody and had a bad attitude. Came here during Black Friday and they had a BOGO, it wasn't even busy so I don't understand why they seemed so miserable. Had I known that was the case, I would've gladly made the drive to another location for better service. Thanks a lot, Rachel!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best acai, pitaya, juice, and smoothie place in town, if not in the country. I just hate that it's 40 min away from me, but I never hesitate to drive all the way down when I crave it.. Which is at least 3 days a week."}
{"text":"The best acai bowl in town by far.   Hoping there will be additional locations in the future.    Friendly employees as well."}
{"text":"Great healthy portions, delicious made fresh to order, place is spacious and ...they started the poke menu...hmmm...trying to figure out how that fits in from Acai to poke. Didn't try their poke, but maybe next time."}
{"text":"Love the acai bowls here. My go to bowl is PB Lover with cocoa powder mixed. So fulfilling and best on a hot day. They need one close to The Palace Station area. There's no Acai bowls on this side of town. I figured Chinatown would have it but they don't."}
{"text":"I like this place for the bowls but it gets 2 stars for customer service. Tonight was the second time there was a teenager or owing adult working who basically told me I couldn't get a bowl because they were out of stuff but it seems like they had started closing down earlier than they were supposed too so didn't want to go through the effort to serve us. I don't think we will be returning nor giving recommendations."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, it was my first time here, I recently moved here to Vegas, unsure of what I was walking into, I asked the lady what she recommends and she picked the best smoothie for me!! One of the best smoothies, and great customer service! I walked out as one happy customer! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best Açaí place on this side of town! The ocean bowl is the best for first timers. Perfect summer snack. #postgymlegday"}
{"text":"I loved this place until they started making the smoothie in my acai bowl taste different every time. Sometimes the consistency of the smoothie is slimy and has no flavor and melts fast. I don't know what some of the workers are doing wrong. Just thought I'd let you guys know to make sure everyone is on the same page with the smoothie making."}
{"text":"Delicious acai bowls, definitely recommend the body builder. Only thing they can improve is getting friendlier cashiers. They have a big high school client base and the cashiers are not the nicest to them."}
{"text":"Now that there are 2 acai joints in town, this place takes the cake! The bowls are amazing! My favorite has to be the chocolate dream! These bowls don't melt as soon as you start eating like juice n go's. They have a huge chalk board on the wall with tons of inspirational quotes! Just the vibe walking into this place is great to just hang out with friends and eat a tasty bowl!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to review the product (a smoothie) because I haven't received it. They have 5 people behind the counter, and I ordered my smoothie almost 10 minutes ago. The service is absolutely terrible and I will not be coming back. So much for an alternative to places like smoothie king or Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! My friends and I come to hang out and talk. The environment is very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:50 and was told they were already closed even though on the door it says 6:00pm. You could tell the employees just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago and absolutely loved it! I just moved back to Vegas and was looking for a good place to get an acai bowl. I'm so happy I found this place! I love the decor, very eclectic and creative. Makes the vibe nice, welcoming and an enjoyable place to sit and eat in. The girl working behind the register was friendly, helpful and make the ordering process nice and easy. It could have been confusing since the menu is in the back, but she let me know as soon as I walked in and answered all of my questions. She was very knowledgable about the items. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The acai is very good , but the service and system they have cause the wait time to be a little to long. Minor fixes & this place could definitely be a 5 star"}
{"text":"I agree with others about this place not having the most lively staff. I do get greeted when I come in but the girls don't smile much. Not huge deal though. The ocean bowl is my favorite, and it is one of the best acai bowls I've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not the best tasting acai bowls here. Not sure what they use for the base but it was very tart and slush like. Maybe it's sorbet?? Reminds me of Jamba Juice acai bowl. The teenage girls working there are clueless when asked questions about the menu, which didn't make my experience any better."}
{"text":"Craving a fresh juice...menu is great.. however I'm totally disappointed and turned off by the person at the register. Took our order, charged us, picked his nose and wrote the name of our order on the cups to be filled. Jeez.. can it get any more disrespectful."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  We were newbies and the staff took us through every step.  The smoothie bowls were super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with the service. They skipped my order 5 times. When I asked if my order would be ready soon I got a random stare. One of the ladies was nice enough to take care of it. Just sucks to wait over 30 minutes for a small single order."}
{"text":"Tonight after a long long day of school and work activities we were hungry and looking for a few fresh smoothies on our way home.  It was after 8pm and we did not realize that Bowlology had closed when we walked up to the door.  They let us in and made a salad and 3 fresh smoothies and juice for us even though they had already closed 15 minutes earlier.   I just have to say how extraordinary that was for them to take care of us....they seemed to know we needed a little kindness and nourishment after a long day!   The juice was so delicious.  We had never been customers, but no doubt we will go back for a more full experience and try their bowls too.   Thank you for a business that cares about people and serves healthy treats!  Very refreshing all the way around."}
{"text":"This establishment stands above measure when it comes to service, product, and cleanliness. I'm always welcomed with a friendly smile/greeting and my order is always superbly presented and never fails on taste! I recommend this establishment to anyone and everyone. The environment is just as pleasing as the staff and product. Nothing beats healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"i went here for the first time monday afternoon...the place is cute enough but the three stringy haired kids they have running the place leaves alot to be desired. We walked in to see no one wearing hairnets which i found unsettling seeins as how they have to scoop stuff out of the freezer to make the smoothies. The worst part of our visit was watching a very annoyed looking purply red headed girl sitting on top of what is a broken freezer in the back begrudgingly get off her phone to make my smoothie she makes it passes it back to the cashier to give to us and then hops right back on top of the broken freezer. The smoothie was ok but for 7 dollars which includes the Mason jar should be in a plastic cup and charge 6 probably wont be back"}
{"text":"First time visit and was impressed. Ordered the Bear with Acai base, wish we had one close to home!"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review for a food place and here is why. Food is good here but the service here always sucks. Everyone who works here looks like they hate their job, especially whoever is at the register. I've never experienced decent customer service from this place. Don't know if it's just me- but I despise that so much. At least try to pretend you enjoy your job."}
{"text":"Serious negative energy in there! The staff was utterly miserable, all of them. Maybe I caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Excellent bowls of freshness- so good. Owner Is friendly and cool. Must frequent this place."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. I come like 4 times a week and get the PB lover. I'd come 4 times a day if I could. This is the only place I have actually saved as a contact in my phone for call in orders.   The other day I came in 3 minutes before opening time and they still took my order :')  #blessed"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that the customer service is amazing I went in on Wednesday the 25th and the two girls working were out standing! Keep up the good work! The food there is also great!"}
{"text":"The Acai bowl was really tasty. I really enjoyed it... but the employees are super rude. They're young kids who were more interested in talking to eachother or playing on their phones rather than helping customers. I had to ask the cashier for help twice, then asked for her recommendations cause it all sounded so good and it was my first time here. She quickly suggested the rise and shine acai bowl... as she was talking to her coworker about her different phone apps. The people in the back blending the bowls and smoothies were all busy talking and looked bored. Other than this... I must say, it was actually really good! Everyrhing is fresh and delicious. There are so many acai bowl/smoothie places popping up around town, that I will try other places with better service! Either they should hire better employees or retrain them to stay off their phones and not make their customers feel like their bothering them. Too bad cause I would love to come here often... but refuse to feel like a bother to someone!"}
{"text":"Been here three times and ordered poke bowls all three. The first time, I got the spicy shoyu- overpriced but fine. The second time, I called ahead to see if they could start making my order because I was running late, and they didn't start it until I got there. It's not like other poke restaurants where everything is out for you to pick and for them to just scoop. Everything is frozen or prepackaged or something, and they sit there slowly unwrapping it all. However, I got an OG this time and it hit the spot. So, about a week later, I got another one. I paid $13 to take a bite and have the grossest flavor ever in my mouth. The fish was bad and I couldn't eat it. I'm not sensitive to those things at all and eat sushi all the time, by the way. If you're a student, just go to the sushi burrito place that just opened in the Student Union. Cheaper, bigger, fresher, faster!"}
{"text":"First time trying these new-fangled acai bowls. It was good stuff but not necessarily worth the price imo."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Super friendly staff, big portions, and great flavors combinations!  Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Waaaay too sugary. I like acai bowls because theyre (supposed to be) relatively healthy. I make my own at home and use the unsweetened acai packets, so when I ran out of ingredients I was excited to know there's a new acai place super close to me. Unfortunately, these acai bowls are just too sweet. Sweetened acai, sweetened coconut, super sweet granola, and honey, makes this yummy treat a dessert and not a good meal replacement. Perhaps consider having an option for unsweetened acai available!"}
{"text":"I first have to say that bowlology has my absolute favorite smoothies! I have only been to the centennial location up until today. On my way home from my doctors appt I decided to exit Charleston and just go to the summerlin location. On my way I called in an order and the girl sounded absolutely annoyed. When I arrived she did not greet me, she looked extremely tired (as if she had a long night with old makeup) and was wearing a hoodie. Overall she looked and talked so short with me again as if I was bugging her by being there at 8:30 in the morning. Just super unprofessional. I think that's the down fall sometimes of young workers. They don't always take costumer service seriously but it does make all the difference. Great products but I think I will stick to only the centennial location. Just really bothered me, enough to get on here and write my first ever review."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Way better than the acai bowls from Nektar in Downtown Summerlin. Rise n Shine is my go to fave here."}
{"text":"Literally cannot get enough of their acai bowls. I have it for lunch at least once a week, usually the bodybuilder. I've also tried their chocolate dream and that was good too. I really should try some other things but I always gravitate to the bodybuilder for some reason :P."}
{"text":"So glad this was across the street from the Red Rock hotel!  Several acai bowl choices as well as smoothies and cold pressed juices.  The large acai bowl is huge but wonderfully delicious.  Located in a strip mall next to Costco.  I wish we had a place like this in Iowa!"}
{"text":"Whenever the 5 star King enters Bowlology, it feels like a lost boy finding refuge in a warm cottage after weeks of wandering through a cold dark forest. The amazing staff greets their guest with a welcome that can only be compared to the sound of a thousand angels blowing trumpets in the heavens.   I recommend the Acaí PB Lover.   P.S. Whatever you do- if the girl behind the register recommends pitaya- STAND YOUR GROUND...and stick with the Acaí :)"}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for my Acai bowl to be made. Admittedly it was a hot day in Vegas & the shop was busy however if you're busy at almost $10 a large bowl, you can afford more staffing. After 20 mins I complained & the response was \"Everyone has waited 20 mins.\"  Also asked a simple question about one item in an Acai bowl I wasn't sure what it was and wasn't responded to very nicely. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.   For anyone who isn't aware, most of the Açaí sold in the world has origins in Brazil and so it's practically a way of life there, as is the beach life, cold beer, back yard bbq, etc, etc...     Wasn't really expecting to find a Brazilian açaí shop in Vegas, but even so, this place left me sad and disappointed at the pale imitation of what a real açaí smoothy is suppose to taste like.  Don't know if it's just that they don't have the same ingredients here or if the açaí is inferior quality, but it's not as good as what you'd get from any corner smoothy shop in Rio.  Having said that, if you are jonesing for açaí, (as my daughter does from time to time), this place will help curb your craving..."}
{"text":"Trying for the first time bowlology the acai bowl was OK and the service was OK if you want good Bowls you need to go to vitality bowl way better"}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor is so pretty and food is amazing. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably delicious!!! I loved everything about it. I got the berry acai and my sister got the body builder acai. I kept taking bites of each because I couldn't get enough. Also, their portions are large (we ordered the regular size). Definitely worth the buy. I can't wait to go back. I think I found my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Garden of Greens smoothie with apple juice instead of vanilla almond milk (allergic to nuts), and it is delish! Like light, sweet, and just a little tart. The girls working in the store were super sweet and helpful explaining the menu. I will definitely be back to try something wls"}
{"text":"Place is clean and the food is good. I will definitely be visiting this establishment more often. I didn't realize that they offered a stamp rewards card. It would have been nice had the young man who took my order mention it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place but I wish they had nutritional information. I like to know what I'm putting in my body! Calorie intake, fat, protein, etc."}
{"text":"I love their bowls!! So refreshing!!  They use fresh ingredients.  I just wish they were larger for the money.  But they're a good treat one in awhile :)"}
{"text":"I've been craving an Acai bowl since I left home and couldn't really find a good place to get one near my location. It was just my luck when I was at the pool at red rock and I found on my maps bowlology. It was so satisfying to be a have an acai bowl after a day spent in the hot sun. Good price too !we had the hula and the PB lover with added protein"}
{"text":"I love acai bowls. Bowlology has delicious options but my biggest pet peeve about this place is the lack of nutritional information. If I'm grabbing something that labels itself as a healthy, nutritious option, I'd like to know not only the vitamin content but also the calories. Often, these acai bowls are nutritious but high in sugar and calorie content.   Bowlology, PLEASE add nutrition information on your menus in store or at least on your website !"}
{"text":"Great food. However, I waited for 2 bowls today for 55 minutes. That's ridiculous.. Not sure if they were short on staff or what but I don't think it should ever take that long. I prob won't go here again."}
{"text":"Very healthy,  get all your vitamins from fruits and vegetables in a green smoothie.  I got the Paradise smoothie, it's very green with Kale and celery, it sure packs a punch,  pow!  The slight sweetness comes from green grapes.  Next time I might try the pitaya bowl for breakfast."}
{"text":"It was my first time to bowlology & I am more disappointed than anything. This location is difficult to find. I used my maps app on my iPhone and still couldn't find it until I called and asked where exactly they are located. The sign is so small. I ordered the Spicy Shoyu. It was the only thing I ordered and when it was  done being made it looked delicious. When I got home, my food wasn't spicy, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't what I ordered. I put some soy sauce on it because there wasn't any sauce at all, which I thought was really odd. I started eating my food and I couldn't stomach the tuna. I always order tuna poke at my regular sushi spot and have never had issues but this time it just wasn't good. It didn't taste good to me. It even smelt funny. I couldn't finish it. I took two bites and had to throw away the entire thing away. What a waste of $13. I don't think I'll come back; to this location or any other. I had my hopes too high for bowlology.  Josh K. Of Bowlology,  The poke bowl I ordered was $11.90 with tax. I put $1.00 for tip because when I called and asked where you guys were located and the guy on the phone was nice about it- SO, my grand total was $12.90.  Sorry, it was a waste of $12.90 EXACTLY.  A refund would be awesome.   Thanks."}
{"text":"The acai bowls here are awesome!  Very fresh and made while you are waiting. Fruit is always ripe and tasty.  I eat here at least once a week!  Berry Good bowl is my favorite. Hula bowl delicious too!"}
{"text":"I've tried many acai bowls including homemade versions and by far this is THE BEST acai bowl place ever! I tried the PB Lover with acai and it was #delicious! I am coming back  tomorrow to have it again!"}
{"text":"Second time here and sad to say that I'm really disappointed  Why do all the places that serve unblended Acai give you so little and try to shove half of the cup with granola down your throat. Obviously, other than air in the cup which is free for them, granola has to be the cheapest ingredient. The 2 stars is for filling up the cup with literally half granola. 2 large Makai Bowls/Cups for basically $22 is not cheap. Next time I will tell them to put the granola on the side so they can't camouflage the bowl to look more full."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to get Acai Bowls because it's almost as great as the ones I've had in Hawaii. Their service is also pretty decent. The workers could care a little more though, like welcoming their customers or thanking them on their way out. But for the most part, they're chill and friendly with a smile.  The wait isn't that long, being that they're usually always busy during lunch hours. I still appreciate their craftiness in making their acai bowls and how great they taste! They have a variety of bowls, juices, smoothies, and even shelved products near the counter. They also have what seems like local business cards on another table near the pick up station which has extra napkins and spoons on them.  The interior is very hipster-like, not to mention all their clocks lol, and they've got free wifi with no purchase needed! They also have a couple tables outdoors if you just wanna relax in the sun. I'm fond of their music choice because it fits perfectly in the whole theme of the place. VERY RELAXED.  I'm a big fan of acai, so if you want quality acai, just come straight to Acai to the T, trust me! The next closest thing is probably Bowls of Heaven then Juice n Go. But still! I definitely recommend this place for Acai Bowls!"}
{"text":"The hula bowl with acai is fire!!!!!!!!!! I could eat that everyday multiple times a day!"}
{"text":"Really good bowls! Chocolate dream is so good  only complaint is it smells bad when walking in, might be the sewage system?? Hopefully it gets dealt with . Also, staff could be a bit more welcoming."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised! This place is great, with a variety of acai and pitaya bowls to choose from for a healthier healthy snack option vaguely similar to a froyo place. Even the regular-sized bowls are a generous portion and can easily serve as a lunch.  Interior décor is modern rustic, and the employees are genuine and friendly. The bowl-building beauties behind the counter are happy to walk you through the menu or make a suggestion based on what you like. My pick is the original acai bowl, which is topped with bananas, strawberries, and honey. Delicious!  Only suggestion is to implement a loyalty card deal- pricing is pretty fair for the value, but I can see myself coming back pretty regularly and would love to be able to earn a discount of some sort.  EDIT: They now have a punch card! Five bowls gets you a freebie. Cards are at the register, you have to ask for them to sign. Now if they can just upgrade to the sturdier cardboard containers and clear bubble lids (like at a froyo joint), so that you don't have to cram your fruit toppings to take the order to go!  EDIT #2: They now offer poke bowls exclusively at this location. I was really disappointed with mine. For the price, it was less than half of what I receive elsewhere and lacked flavor. Between that and the declining service, I'm dropping a star. I still come here regularly but am actively looking for other options."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I had the Ocean Acai fruit bowl. Totally awesome. So refreshing. I will definitely be back to try their other bowls"}
{"text":"Loved the \"Feel Good\" Pitaya Bowl.  Good service, very friendly people, and the bowls are just amazing. Nice decor inside.  I like the look and feel of it. WiFi also available there.  Glad they are here at this location."}
{"text":"Love this place. Açaí/pitaya bowls are delicious here and so is the chicken teriyaki bowl. I come here almost every day"}
{"text":"Never been so addicted to acai bowls until I've tried Bowlology! I first ordered one of their acai bowls through Postmates and boy was it bomb! I became obsessed so I also exposed it to my fiancé, and now we literally come here everyday as well as other locations closer to our house. We always get the Rise & Shine, which is a blend of pineapple, mangoes & bananas topped with granola, strawberries, bananas & honey. Acai bowls are typically sour but this one is a mix of sweet and tangy but it's hella good! I don't normally eat strawberries, so I just have them replace it with extra bananas. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite acai place in town. I like the perfect sweet but not too sweet acai. I love the decor of the place . And luv their occasional great deals... I was able to buy fresh cold pressed juice for $3"}
{"text":"I use to love it here the employee was rude and kept giving me stars when I had asked for no bananas in my smoothie or bowl, I am highly allergic and to get a response like that really upset me. Also I'm pretty sure I was charged for a large but got a small."}
{"text":"I come here often and get the Berry Good bowl with Açaí. I'm obsessed with anything açaí, so I know I couldn't go wrong with this place. The customer service is fine and they're pretty quick with my order. Their bowls are more on the smoothie side (really blended) I'm more of a fan of thicker consistency.. but still very good and they give you a pretty good amount of it."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to update my review and take away stars solely based on the service received during our recent visit.    Good service is key, I mean why would anyone want to settle for less?  The service at this location on this occasion was the reason for this update.   So robotic no service with a smile.  I really wish I would have gotten her name but if you come here you will probably know, it doesn't seem like she ever smiles (except when it's probably time to clock out). She gave the same service to the next 2 patrons after us.  She was the only one here at the time I ordered, but it was not busy.   So she takes my order tells me the amount, I pay, and then she gives me a receipt without saying a word.  She then proceeds to walk towards the back to start on the order.  I waited there thinking is she coming back? I looked at my husband in disbelief and walked away to wait for my order.   A few minutes later she calls out my name and the items are just handed over without another single word.    Now, I know everyone knows bad services from good, even the rudest of people would know if they were receiving bad service.  No excuse!!  This needs to be reiterated here.  Their product is great but still without the good service to complete the experience and plenty of other options around the valley, you may not have such a high return rate on customers."}
{"text":"This spot was formerly Bowl of Heaven, and in it's current incarnation has the same interior decor and a similar menu- with the addition of poke bowls, which I have not yet tried. Business caters to the surrounding UNLV students, offering a student discount and keeping a current summer hour schedule (M-F closing at 4PM, closed weekends) that makes it difficult for anyone else to patronise the business.   The Ocean bowl was just alright- in the future I'll probably stick to the Hula bowl, which is more of a classic version with strawberries, bananas, and coconut on top. The Chocolate Dream was not my thing at all, berries + chocolate = no me gusta, also very heavy on the granola for some reason.    Service leaves something to be desired. Came by at 3:30 on a weekday, half an hour prior to close, and the chairs were already up so dining in wasn't even an option. Staff said the bare minimum for my transaction, could be friendlier.   TIP: Go big or go home. Spring for the $10 large bowl, the regular barely had any acai once they put in the granola on bottom and fruit on top!"}
{"text":"The place had a quaint ambience. The decor had writings on the walls that featured the menu and patron scribbles. The Victorian white couch definitely accented the place. Not to mention the framed quote of the day.  The price is high but everything is fresh and made to order and plenty at that. A refreshing treat after a monster work out. The green machine is a burst of energy! A bowl filled with blended acai, spinach, kale, bananas, peaches and vanilla almond milk, topped with kiwi, banana chia seeds, granola and honey. It is the right blend of fresh vitavetavegamin!!! Try to say that 3 times fast!  Match that up with a large cup of freshly squeezed Summer Love. A blend of orange, strawberry and watermelon. The juice really quenched my thirst.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with these other reviews?! but this place is DELICIOUS!!!! Every time I'm here it's never a let down."}
{"text":"This review is based on the fact that I've never had an acai bowl and have nothing to compare it to. I've been here when it was a frozen yogurt shop and I like the decor and what they've done with the place, very cute and inviting. The workers were friendly but I believe I saw the owner and he did not say a word. I was hoping he would give me some information considering he heard it's my first time.  I really wanted to like it, and I did when I was given a sample.   When it was made it was then blended with premade apple juice and within 2 minutes it was cold soup like and melted not making it very appetizing. But I did enjoy it for the first 2 minutes, then it started melting. Again I wouldn't know if this is common practice to blend with apple juice but I do try to stay away from juices unless they are freshly squeezed and this was not.   I would like to try other acai bowls and so I would have something to compare it to. Others seem to give it great reviews which is what brought me in."}
{"text":"I'm hooked - I love this place! I have only tried the Body Builder and the Rise & Shine so far, but they're so good, I have had them both several times now. I have only tried the açai bowls so far cuz I love the crunch of the granola & fresh fruit, but the smoothies look delicious too! I am trying the pitaya bowls next. I hear the Ocean Cup is pretty popular.  This is also the perfect meeting place: comfortable atmosphere, relaxed, clean, bright. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, efficient & good-looking (ok, that last one is a bonus)! I only wish it was open a littler later & definitely later on Sundays. I get it though: açai is more of a breakfast type of food, but with the heat of summer, I would gladly have a large bowl for dinner!"}
{"text":"Bowlology is great stop! The OG Poke bowl is what you should definitely order. I will be back with my clients ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Now that the weather is warm its Bowlology time!!! I've had several bowls with in several weeks and they are still delicious!"}
{"text":"Items listed on the website are not sold at this location. Customer service was very poor, and both managers and employees seemed to have poor knowledge of the items sold. Purchased a green juice and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Got the rise and shine acai bowl which was delicious and also the OG tuna poke bowl which was disappointing because it was super basic, salty and overpriced. Stick to the acai bowls!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend before one of our classes and all I can say is WOW! We had never been here before and the employee was very patient and gave us samples. Great customer service. When we finally made our decision, ordered and they were done within 10 minutes. And these Açai bowls were absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here like 3 times last week! The customer service was always good and the acai bowls taste great. I usually get Rise & Shine, it's perfect when craving something sweet but healthy."}
{"text":"OK, I have to confess, I came in here by mistake. I really wanted a poke bowl (the restaurant next door) but walked into the wrong place by mistake. Not as demented as it sounds since they have a poke bowl menu. I went with the Wicked Tuna Signature bowl ($11) with ahi tuna, cabbage slaw, ginger, edamame, cucumber (lots and lots of cucumber), and togarashi sauce. I got it with a base of brown rice (lots and lots of brown rice). While the tuna tasted fresh, I felt it was way too heavy on the sauce. And the rice/cucumber to protein ratio was way too heavy on the rice/cucumber. It is a pretty small restaurant. So when they turn on the blender to make someone else a smoothie, conversation in the whole restaurant has to stop (and that blender is going often during lunch hour). I can't comment on their smoothies or other specialty items, but I would not come back here for a poke bowl."}
{"text":"Their acai bowls are amazing!! They also are very flexible on toppings that you want which made the entire process better"}
{"text":"I recently came in for an Acai bowl and it was great, the environment was really cute, the customer service was alright."}
{"text":"The service was great. The girl helped me with all of my questions because it was my first time here. She was very patient and kind. I asked a bunch of questions and took forever to order (how annoying right) but she still had awesome customer service.  I'm originally from O'ahu, Hawaii so of course I know what a real acai bowl should taste like and I'm extremely picky. I've tried a variety of acai up here in Vegas and it's depressing that these people up here think they know a good acai bowl. I finally decided to try Bowlology and I'm pretty happy about it. The fruit isn't exactly fresh, the strawberries have a weird artificial taste to it.... BUT, the \"berry good\" acai tastes the closest to a HIcravings bowl. I really enjoyed their granola! It's not the best acai bowl I've had but the best in Vegas for sure (so far).  The downfall part was that they didn't have any spicy tuna ready for a bowl. After I completed my order, they informed me that their tuna was still frozen. Kind of weird considering it's Saturday night and I would imagine you'd be a little more prepared for a Saturday night rush. It's alright though, upon reading the rest of the reviews about how terrible the poké bowls are... it's probably best I didn't get one.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to try this place out for a very long time. I got the Bear Bowl and it was so yummy! Although, the fee other Acai bowls I have had in the past came with tons of gronola, this had enough for a fine layer of topping. So doesn't lower my rating as it was still amazing, just wasn't as grainy as the ones in San Diego"}
{"text":"Super fresh and they will custom your drink. I asked for a Paradise smoothie and requested fresh squeezed apple juice. It was delish."}
{"text":"It's awesome to have a poke place so close to home. This place is pretty good but the bowls could be a little bigger for the price. I understand the fish isn't cheap but they should add a little extra rice or something to help fill you up. I was starving an hour after dinner!  They should take a cue from Poke Time in San Francisco, which is more of a create-your-own set up which allows you to pick your own rice, toppings and sauce to go with the fish, all for the same cost."}
{"text":"I luv this place and not scared to tell you .. Flat addicted !!! These bowls are so amazing ! Went everyday for almost a week .  A must do !!!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are one of my go-to summer foods when it's so hot outside that heated food sounds straight up unappealing. As a bonus, this chain now also offers poke bowls too. However, their consistency is lacking and prices are high.  POKE: I won't order these here any more due to their poor value. Barely any fish, many toppings and ingredients out of stock, overpriced for what you get. I like that they have poke bowls available but unless they're going to do them well, there's no point.  ACAI: Some days there's a ton of fruit topping, other times there's barely any. Sometimes the acai flavor is strong and fresh, other times the mix is pale and bland. I don't know if it's a product issue or a training issue but I can't order the same thing twice and receive the same product. Same issues with pricing as above, overpriced for what you get.   Overall, I like the variety of the menu and the ability to grab a \"healthy\" lunch on the go when working nearby but I will really only stop here out of convenience due to consistency and pricing issues."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with acai and pitaya bowls. My wife had never had them, so she wanted to try then before i made them at home. The location is in a busy strip area. The decor is Victorian chic and very comfortable.  The menu is very cute and done on a chalkboard. They have a variety of bowls, juices, smoothies, and poke bowls.   My wife decided on the chocolate dream acai bowl. The blend hand cocoa in it. The topping was strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips, and honey... Yum! My wife just wishes there was a little more chocolate flavor to the blend.  I chose the body builder. Peanut butter in the acai blend! Topped with strawberries and bananas sans honey and almonds. I loved mine, but it also needed more peanut butter in the blend.   There bowls are so fresh and filling. I always feel energized and satisfied after having one ! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and my sister and I got the kids size Berry Good Açaí bowl! It was soooo good!! Fresh pieces of fruit with every bite. Smoothie was nice and thick to the last bite. With crunchy granola, what's not to love! I can't wait to come back here when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Changing my rating. When the place first opened it was great. I look forward to having these monthly treats when getting my hair done (it is right next door). I get the rise and shine every time. Today it was a half-ass attempt at making it. I hate it when my favorite places are not consistent. I was telling my hair dresser about my disappointment and she agreed that the consistency in the acaci bowls is poor, and she eats there way more often. I still love the place, I just hope next month it is better."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. I drove all the way here to get an Acai bowl and it wasn't even closing time. The door was still unlocked and the cleaning lady had to tell me that the workers left early BEFORE closing time.  One of the girls ran to me as I was leaving, as in the business was left unattended during open hours to tell me they have been dead for the last hour so they decided to close early. I asked her nicely if she could just make my order and she said everything was already put away.  This is ridiculous! Anyways every review obviously is about how horrible their customer service is and for her to give me a rude reply about how I was going to  complain to the owner is pretty shitty. She practically showed me that her customers don't mean anything to her or her job or to this place. Thanks to the girl with the long blonde hair who was extremely rude to me. I will never be returning and will be passing this message on to everyone.   Man, the owner should really change their staff if they want more success in this business."}
{"text":"I am addicted..this stuff is really good. I have tried a few things but my favorite is the Rise & Shine. It's great when you want something sweet but not too rich or fattening. It definitely hits the spot - plus I feel amazing after I eat it. I get a burst of energy and feel more focused. I like that there's a lot of options to choose from, because I have a feeling I will be here a lot..."}
{"text":"First of all I am impressed with acai to the t's acai bowls and pitaya smoothie! It's so Delicious!!!!!   Great customer service from Kennedy! She was more than happy to help me and substitute my fruits for a different one. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Atmosphere is clean and lots of space.   I highly recommend everyone to come here. I'm excited to try everything else on their menu especially their one day juice cleanse."}
{"text":"Honestly this place has the best Acai bowls in the world, the staff was impeccable. Super friendly and helpful, but I was more surprised on how educated they were. Cold pressed juices are on point. All the other bowl places in town you guys suck!"}
{"text":"I don't know what I was expecting based off of my friend's description, but it wasn't what I got (in a good way!).   We entered and the place was pretty empty. The staff greeted us right away and was very friendly. I don't recall seeign a high chair, but the seatong along the wall was sowide, I wasn't worried. We had my 11 month old with us and she was fine hanging out on the extra wide bench seating.   I got the Mango smoothie. It was pretty good, but a little on the tart side. I woukd have expected a Mango flavored drink the be a litt sweeter or at least be something I could consume. My friend got one of the bowls, but I forget which one. I did try some, along with the kidx and we both liked it. I might just have to go back and venture off the safety of smoothies and try some bowls."}
{"text":"Visit pretty often and loved how I could purchase 1 large bowl and have it split for my 2 kids.   Came in today and was informed \"we no longer do that\".  Super bummed :(  I won't be coming as often. $8 each is way too much"}
{"text":"BOMB! finally, a place i can compare to home and just as good. i had the berry good bowl. good consistency and flavor. i don't like watered-down acai and their acai blend is perfect. i like mine a little more tart but its good enough for me. I'm just sad because it's in summerlin which its a little far for me to go everytime i want a bowl. if they do decide to expand i hope they come to spring valley! i'll be there everyday!!! i definitely recommend this place if you want an acai bowl. looking forward to trying other bowls too such as the body builder and the rise and shine. love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this store. Used to go there when it was Bowl of Heaven; was kinda sad when I heard it was changing to Bowlology. Then, I discovered that the owner is now the same owner as Acai To The T, so that discovery restored sanity to the world (cuz that is among THE finest acai bars I've found yet).  Anyway, Bowlology has the same menu as its sister store, the young ladies that work there are truly delightful, and I've dealt with every one of them.  Ingredients couldn't be fresher.  Restaurant is always so clean that it sparkles.  (As stated), the crew working there is personable, knowledgable, quick, and work hard to see that their customers are satisfied. It's the only place where somebody has come from behind the counter to ask if my Pitaya Berry Good bowl was good, if it was as I wanted it, and if I needed anything else.  I found one other restaurant that I like a little bit more, but that other place is on Maui, which makes getting there weekly pretty tough. I live in Anthem, yet I drive to either Bowlology or Acai To the T at least once a week.  Worth the effort, the time, and the money."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since they opened it, and to be honest I love the açai bowls, and they have this rewards program that after 10 you get one free. All ingredients are fresh and all of the bowls taste delicious :D I really crave them for long, since my schedule doesn't always match their hours, :( that's not the reason they got 2 stars. The first disappointment was a day a couple of months ago that was closed 2 hours before the closing time with no sign of closed for... or we will be closed. So I thought ok probably I just didn't got the memo. But apparently they function like that however the fuck they want without warning. I have never had the greatest customer service which is okay with me I don't mind, people don't have to smile to me all the time. So with all that said I went in today for my addiction; ordered my PB lover açai bowl, a smoothie for my hubby and two up stream poké bowls. 1st issue: They didn't had salmon. But in my mind I was ok no biggie let's do it with tuna but the same ingredients on that dish. Ok problem solved, the girls told me my total; forty something with cents. I remember my change was supposed to be 8 dlls with change. And I try to pay with a 50 dollar bill. 2nd issue: Oh we don't accept any bill larger than 20 (WTF?). I thought I would make sense if I wanted to pay a piece of gum with a 50 dollar bill, yeah sure doesn't make sense. but I said -well you only have to give me 8.something for change so... and she called another girl (which by the way they were going to close in like an hour and a half and they had like 5 girls there, and still took forever to give me my one drink and bowl, I know spoiler) -to tell me that it is their policy and they cannot have a 50 dollar bill in their register, to what I ask - where does it said that? (because of course how am I gonna know all the policies in all the local places I go without a written warning or note ;p) and she answers - oh nowhere but they are very strict with that policy and they told us... I just had a $20 and a $10 in my wallet. I mean what type of business doesn't want money?? 3rd issue: They didn't solve their problem. Instead I got asked to go change the bill to the business next door, that guess what? they sell poké bowls too, and took my 50dollar bill. There they literally send a customer to another business, unless they're affiliated which I don't think so..  It's a depressing review because I was (probably still am) in love with this place, but it keeps hurting me and taking me for granted:'(, it forces me to learn to live without it, or look for something else."}
{"text":"Healthy options, and great prices for the quality. The bowls are delicious with fresh ingredients. And they have all the add-ones you could want"}
{"text":"I love this spot! The green machine with pitaya is my go to bowl. It is delicious! I could seriously eat one everyday. I am cautious of my sugar intake and it has the least sugar compared to their other bowls. I really wish that making your own personalized bowl was an option just so I can switch it up but other than that, I can't complain. I do have to say that I love the fact that they put granola on the top and bottom. Aside from their menu of bowls, juices, smoothies, and nut milks, they also sell gluten free snacks on the wall near checkout which I can definitely appreciate. The best part is that it's right near my place :)"}
{"text":"Thai place would be perfect but they don't give you easy access to the nutrition facts in store or online so if you're tracking your macros this place makes it difficult"}
{"text":"What a great experience I'm addicted! I now tried several of them but my fav is Rise and Shine acai bowl with strawberries blueberries kiwi and a touch of honey Yummy! Healthy tasty and a great meal replacement."}
{"text":"LOVE... YUM!!!  The one to the right was mine and I got it blended with vanilla protein powder!!!  HIGHLY recommended!  Also a great location with awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"On the fence about this place. Pluses were that the young man at the front was very nice, place was clean, and the size of the bowls are decent. Minuses were that I don't know but my peanut butter pitaya bowl just didn't taste \"fresh\". It was lacking in sweetness as far as the pitaya went, and the ratio of toppings to pitaya was way off. I had about 1/4 of pitaya, and over 1/2 of toppings which did not balance out well. The biggest minus was that my son pulled a long hair out of his bowl after a few bites in ugh! Although the girl in the back did remake us a new bowl, she didn't offer a sorry or seem apologetic in any way or take any responsibility. We showed her the hair and asked for a new bowl and she simply said \"ok\". I know these things can happen but it was not a good first impression for our first time here. This makes me not want to return at all, BUT if I do get my occasional cravings for pitaya bowls I will most likely give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I've never had an acai bowl so I have nothing to compare it to, but I got the body builder and it was really good. The blended portion of it tastes like a peanut butter & jelly sandwich and mixing the almonds, bananas and strawberries with it makes it taste better. the health benefits from acai should be enough to get you in the door and the delicious options will get you to come back."}
{"text":"It is my first time anywhere that serves Acai and Pitaya bowls. The cashier was helpful but not friendly and the owner/manager was in the lobby with his buddies talking. It was clearly very busy and the owner jumped in and helped out after a few minutes. I ordered the Pitaya Ocean Cup. The poke bowls were out because they had run out of salmon. It was a Wednesday and it was the middle of the day.  So, I tried the fruit bowl and it was not a \"wow\" kind of thing to me. There was fresh (and a small portion,) of fruit. As I did order a regular size. This was just an overpriced smoothie/bowl of cut up strawberries and kiwis with some standard granola. I don't know what to compare this to, but I sure as heck can make a better bowl of this stuff at home. Especially for the $7 a pop. Another issue I had was, I had to wait about 20 minutes for 2 bowls. This is a place I probably would not do a repeat visit, unless someone offered to pay for this."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here and I tried summer love drink and it has oranges,strawberry's,and also some watermelon you know the healthy protein or vitamin c and I found out it is so delicious"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Hands down best acai bowl. The service is AMAZEBALLS!!! Do yourself a favor and drop by to get a taste of real acai and the best customer service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Staff was friendly and the pitaya and acai bowls are amazing! I recommend the Ocean Cup! So refreshing and a great way to keep cool in the las vegas summer heat!"}
{"text":"Good acai bowls.  I always try ordering acais bowls that are mixed with other things but it's just not as good as pure Acai! If you're like me then get the makai bowl here or anywhere.   I tried the berry good and it melted so fast. I tasted the peanut butter one and that one gets very old fast.   The service is nice!   I wonder how their poke bowels taste! I'll def come back again to try that also."}
{"text":"This place offers poke bowls, super bowls, smoothies and fresh squeezed juice. It's kinda pricey, but filling! The super bowls range from $8 to $12.50 which are like smoothies in a bowl with toppings hahaha. You first pick a base either pitaya or acai, then toppings that vary in many different combinations. My 1st time here......it took me a long time to choose an option.  I have only tried their super bowls and poke bowls here.    Some of my favorites include Spicy Shoyu Poke Bowl- ahi tuna, yellow onion, green edemame, onion, pickled veg, and sesame seeds. Bear Bowl with Acai- toppings include strawberry, banana, blueberry, dark chocolate chips, almonds, granola, and honey.  If you come frequently, take advantage of their stamp card, buy 10 get the 11th one free.  You'll catch me here once every couple of months on payday....because its expensive."}
{"text":"Hello! I've been a customer for quite a while here and I always come in and get the PB acai bowl so today I came in and decided to get something different. I went with the ocean bowl and substituted apple juice for chocolate almond milk because I like that blend in the PB bowl. Unfortunately I didn't like it because it was sour so I asked the cashier if I can just get something different so she said she'll get the manager for me so I was like yeah okay cool that's fine! So the manager came and I said \"I apologize I wante to try something new and I know it's an inconvenience but can you please remake it?\" I was being really nice because I work in fast food I know how customers can be but that's also my money. So she looked at me blankly and said \"so you want us to remake it because you changed the order and didn't like it?\" Honey, yes, that's exactly what I want you to do because at every food establishment when a customer doesn't like something it can just easily be remade. She then just grabbed my unwanted bowl from my grasp which struck me by surprise... So I ended up just saying thank you and she jus looked at me and went to make it which made me feel so stupid, I don't appreciate the attitude. Normally I'd just speak up for myself but I was already tired from the heat and just wanted my acai bowl. That was very rude and I would expect a manager to treat customers with respect but I suppose not. Maybe learn to treat people better when they're being nice to you??? Just a wild suggestion. So if you're reading this just know my first Yelp review is about you and I don't normally ever write reviews. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"When I need motivation to study or if I'm in need of food to cheer me up, I often opt to getting an acai bowl. Rather than eating one gallon of ice cream, I feel less regretful since they blend fresh fruits and veggies here.   My favorites would be to be either the Makai or Ocean, large size! More bang for your buck.   P.S. Student discount for UNLV, and they have stamp cards, yay!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I would have given them 5 stars, because the quality deserves it, I just wish there was a bigger menu of their deliciousness. I got the wicked ahi bowl on rice and I'm in love. I was starving and surrounded by fast food, but wanted something better for my body. Well let me tell you,  I made the right decision. I am full and I don't feel like I just packed my body with a bunch of processed, greasy, food. Only problem, now I can't wait to come back and try their blended fruit bowls.  Thanks guys, you were life savers today."}
{"text":"I love the bowls here. I just wish they were open on Sundays. I find them very reasonable, filling, and yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are decent for a Las Vegas location but the customer service here is terrible. No welcoming, no greeting, just \"what do you want\"."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat. Their poke bowls are phenomenal! They have a whole assortment of smoothies and other food options as well. Small space, intimate little atmosphere. Very very laid-back. If you're craving a good poke bowl make sure you get there before lunchtime or any other typical rush-hour because it gets packed And I mean like sardines in a can crushed by a trash compactor smashed by a meteor packed."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and every time it's amazing. The açaí bowls are delicious and so are the smoothies. I'm always looking forward to go here."}
{"text":"PB&J lovers -  so good! I have been to many different places that make these bowls and never had such fast service.  I've seriously waited up to 20 minutes at some places so I was pleasantly surprised less than 4 minutes went by and I had my bowl.  Next time I'll get the kids size because they really filled the regular size up and it was almost too much to finish.  The strawberries were fresh and flavorful the little chocolate chips were just the right sweet without being too sweet and the chopped peanuts gave just the right amount of PB flavor.  Crunchy granola - and seriously that bowl was full! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely 5 stars!!!! The Berry Good bowl was amazing and what was even more amazing was our treatment. I didn't see any bananas on the bowl(which on the menu it did say bananas) so we asked about it and the guy working or owner said it's blended in the acai(which it was) but then cut up bananas and brought it to us!!! Loved it! We don't find that kind of service anywhere anymore! Recommending this place to everyone and will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for for quick trip and needed to eat a healthy smoothie/acai bowls. The location by UNLV was closed so we Ubered to one in Sumerlin. Well worth the drive. Very friendly staff and very accommodating. I got the Green Machine acai bowl and and was not disappointed. Husband got the PB acai bowl and husband said his was excellent. Wish we had Bowlologys back in Texas."}
{"text":"The Blue Crush bowl they currently have is amazing!! Great for when you are craving sweetness, while still remaining nutrient. My usual order is Hula which is always made perfect. I will definitely be trying all the other flavors."}
{"text":"Last time i was here it was called bowl of heaven. I like this place better.   The large acai bowl is twice as big as the regular & only $2 more! Bring a friend and split it!  I got the PB bowl & it was fantastic! I will be back."}
{"text":"Finally a legit acai bowl in Vegas! The price is right too! Make sure you get a punch card. The customer service is approachable so talk about what you like. They will customize bowls to fit your taste. They have two sizes. I usually get the smaller size and feel full for my whole workday.  Don't know what an acai bowl is? Imagine eating a bowl of cereal full of chunks of fresh bananas and strawberries. Now imagine that instead of milk it's a berry smoothie. It's like eating dessert, but it's made with many healthy ingredients.  Body Builder- You'll hear customers ordering this acai bowl all day long. As a regular acai bowl eater I can really taste the peanut butter in this one. Relative to ones I've had these are creamy from the almond milk. Apple juice mellows out the acai too. Thank goodness they cut the toppings into bite-sized pieces. A generous amount of honey covers the top. The only thing this one is missing is fresh coconut flakes. These guys are so nice I bet they would put it on there for me. The bottom has the perfect amount of hemp granola.  Peanut Butter Lover- Naturally I had to try this pitaya bowl. Sure enough it has a strong peanut butter flavor. They were kind enough to let me try it with chopped almonds on top, which it usually doesn't and that made it even nuttier. The color of the pitaya is a startling pink, but it very mild and fruity. Don't be scared to try this one. Super good.  This place is great, but I do wish the seating was a little more ergonomic. Most of the table and chairs don't match and make the eating experience a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"One of the best acai bowls I've had. I love the PB lover just the right hint of peanut butter. The bee pollen they add in each bowl is great too. We've been back multiple times, it's a great choice!"}
{"text":"Good customer service  Prices are moderate to high Bowls are good. I get acai and my husband gets Pitaya.  Disappointed no one ever shared the loyalty program (stamp card) we definitely would have earned a free one by now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Great acai bowls, and wonderful customer service. Nice to come hang out and enjoy something heathy."}
{"text":"Obsessed!!!! Me n my niece r in lust with our Acai bowls, we work out and as a Reward- hit up this fab place :) ACAI bowls r the bomb.  They r soooo goood for u and refreshing on these unbearable hotttt smoldering days in the desert!!! Def stop in and grab one.  U won't regret!   So much tastier n healthier that Fro-Yo next door... ENJOY and get extra honey. ; )"}
{"text":"Raised price for second time this year  A large bowl is now 12.00 it's good but not worth the price"}
{"text":"Great selection of acai and pitaya bowls as well as smoothies. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, reasonable price. More tables would be nice, but still love the decor. We love to stop in for a quick refreshing treat. Tried the Body Builder bowl today and it was delicious and not overwhelming with the peanut butter--just enough to add a nice dimension to the acai flavor! Love it here."}
{"text":"Super impressed with their healthy and affordable options. Staff was super friendly and helpful and my smoothie was done super fast!! Its in a great area and all of my grandchildren who go to the college near by love it as well. Our favorite drink is the Pink Dragon !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so refreshing! A perfect spot to go to on a hot day or after the gym for a healthy snack. I went for the \"rise & shine\" acai bowl topped with banana & strawberries. Everything tasted so fresh & it's not a long wait at all. The interior is beautifully decorated, kept cool, with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Loveeeeed this place right when I walked in! Very nicely decorated spot with cute sofas and chairs. The only thing that confused me was that the menu was opposite end of the register. They should probably move that. People typically go the register and order from there. The service was great! I was bummed when I ordered my Poke bowl (YES they have Poke!) that they were out of brown rice :( I eat healthy so I prefer it. So the lady working, which I wish I remembered her name, but she gave me a bit more tuna in my bowl to compensate for them not having brown rice available. I ordered the best bowl made of dragon fruit and mangoes VS The regular acai bowl! Both are very delicious but this one was out of this world! Definitely going back for seconds to this place!!"}
{"text":"We wanted something light before flying out of Vegas and decided to go for an Acai bowl.  The place is cool and the people friendly.  They have a few seating inside and outside.  I ordered the regular size \"Rise and shine\" bowl and it was yummy...it had strawberries and bananas with drizzle of honey.  If we weren't flying out that day, I would have gotten the large.  The meal itself was less than $10, so it was well worth it.    Unfortunately, it is not close to the strip but it was worth the trip out to check it out.  i would be back and next time, I would get the large and bring it back to the hotel and chill at the pool."}
{"text":"This review is for the poke bowl I tried at this location. The fish wasn't as fresh as I'd prefer, fairly chewy and fishy tasting. There wasn't much variety either, regarding sauce or toppings.   I'd skip the poke bowl here and just stick with the Acai bowls."}
{"text":"I tried the Berry Bowl Acai bowl and it was satisfying. The right amount of sweetness, and generous toppings. The only complaint I have is the type of container they put it in. It's too tall and I was annoyed that I had to stick my fist in to reach the bottom of the bowl!   I love their selection of cold press juices and nut mylk's. they also give samples and full size bottles out for free!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to my apartment complex so it's super convenient. Aside from just the convenience factor, their food is amazing. I've tried their chicken teriyaki bowl and the chicken and teriyaki sauce was extremely tasty. Only complaint would be that the rice was slightly hard. Their Açaí bowls are great all around, love them. I could eat one of those everyday.  They also offer smoothies and juices! If you're looking for a fast place with healthier options, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Moving here from California I've been searching for a good acai bowl for a long time. FINALLY came across this place and have gone at least twice a week since. The beautiful girl behind the counter, Dakota, makes the best bowls and gives he friendliest service!"}
{"text":"Ok. First time here. The set up is fine. Decor is normal for this type of establishment.  They just started build your own bowl and were confused on how to charge me (took awhile). Then they didn't have macadamians (didn't know this until after I ordered and sat down)....ugh!!! 15$ for a small bowl and water....WOWZERS!!!! manager gave me my 1$ back for the macadamians....LOL!!! food came out. It was good but small.  Manager was nice and asked about my meal and since I didn't get the protein I was refunded three extra dollars. I'm not sure I won't return. Seems like some people really like it because they stayed steady. I just expect more.  Maybe just a bad day for them. It happens. Good luck biology. Great concept. Think some tweeking is needed."}
{"text":"I Love this place! My go to for smoothies and açaí bowls, truly the best!! Customer service is great and it always super clean. Check it out!"}
{"text":"On their 'contact us' part of the website this is what I said, I think it gives good insight to my experience:  I'm quite upset after my latest experience at bowlology. I had been previously told by several employees at several different locations that the chocolate chips were vegan. On the morning of April 6, 2017, I decided to switch things up from my normal order of the PB lover no honey, no bee pollen. I asked for the chocolate dream and to confirm once again that the chocolate chips were vegan. The employee then went to the back to double check. I greatly appreciated this as a strict ethical and health conscious vegan. However, I am upset that this whole time I had been consuming these chocolate chips without the knowledge that they contained milk. I then asked the employee if I could submit a request for you guys to offer a vegan chocolate chip and she said, \"I don't know, we can tell corporate but it's just hard because vegan stuff usually doesn't taste good.\" You can imagine by taken back by this, my jaw dropped and I was left in awe. How is it that at a supposedly \"healthy kitchen & juice bar\" your employees, a. Don't know which products are okay for customers with special dietary restrictions and b. Have the audacity to say vegan things don't taste good... it is crucial that in a supposedly healthy establishment you have educated, charismatic, and helpful employees. After my experience talking to this lady, I felt uncared for and not like a valued customer whose needs had been fulfilled. I hope the \"corporate\" team is able to do something about the discrepancy with the lack of vegan chocolate chips as well as the poor customer service.  Thank you"}
{"text":"So today is Pink Dragon, chocolate monster, green machine, pb lovers, and our house salad....Yummy. That should hold me over for 2 days. They also introduced 2 new cleanses. Can't wait to try."}
{"text":"I started coming to this location a lot when I moved here a couple months ago. The people that work are so nice, quick to put your order, and over all it was clean inside. A little prices but the portions were good. I started noticing they were getting new people to start working a few weeks ago. I keep coming back but each time is getting worse from the last. The portions now is less than half of what it use to be. I went to the Henderson location and showed them a picture of what I got at the centennial location and they even said that was too little.  I hope management steps it up, because this is truly a great and healthy place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday cause I got a gift card from my boss. Have to say when you walk in it felt really good to breath in clean fresh air with the smell of fresh juices and the aroma of strawberries and bananas and of course acai. The menu and set up for ordering is not set up well cause when u walk in to the counter you don't actually order there. Me and the hubby stood there hella confused until the guy told us that we needed to walk toward the back wall to sit and look at the menu.  Regardless, menu was pleasing and lots of choices. Pretty much what I expected: acai bowls, juices, smoothies and this thing called Pitaya. Not sure what that is.... Looks like dragon fruit and I don't know why they wouldn't call it that on the menu instead of making me google it.  So we went to counter to order where the girl named Kennedy was super abrasive and had horrible customer service. She barely made eye contact and you could tell by her attitude she didn't wanna be there. She was super unpleasant and when I saw her grab 2 large bowls when I ordered 2 small bowls, I thought she didn't hear me so I repeated that I didn't order large bowls. She quickly and angrily told me: \"those are not yours!\" Then we paid and there was no way I was giving her a tip with her crappy attitude.  We ended up ordering a small body builder and rise and shine. Rise and shine is their basic bowl. But truthfully I'm not a sweet kinda person and the body builder hit the spot! A wonderful combination of just enough peanut butter topped with almonds gave it a salty and crunch taste. And when combined with a strawberries and bananas totally scrumptious.  Totally will be back! But too bad that girl had such a bad attitude for such a positive and healthy work culture and environment. 3 stars for her horrible attitude and customer service"}
{"text":"I've been going to bowlology for awhile now. The things I like about this place is that they have a lot of healthy options. Smoothies, fruit bowls, and they even have lunch/dinner bowls! Their menu does change every now and then. I usually get the ocean bowl, with açaí. You can get pitaya, which is dragon fruit as a base if you don't like açaí ! It is pretty tasty, especially in the summer time because it is nice and refreshing! The tartness really wakes you up in my opinion. You can also change fruit on top if you don't like the toppings.  I also like the fact that they have a stamp card, for every 10 bowls you purchase you get a free regular bowl, because the amount you pay for a bowl or smoothie is a little pricey. Which is why my review has 3 and if I could add a half I would, so 3 and a half stars! Also if you work in the plaza they give you a 10% discount, because ya know. A dollar is a dollar! They also do call ahead orders, so you can call and order your bowl before work if you work around the plaza and you just go in, pay, and pick up! Quick breakfast idea if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love the hula bowl and green machine bowls! Eat there at least 3 times a week!! The juices are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Love the PB Lover açaí bowl.  I don't like strawberries so I sub the strawberry topping with blueberry.  I add extra granola and chocolate chips!  It's so delicious!  Today I'm trying a smoothie.  I couldn't make a choice but i did end up choosing something out of the ordinary.  I got the Pink Dragon smoothie which has Pitaya, strawberries, watermelon, coconut oil, cucumber, dates, turmeric, hemp seeds, vanilla almond milk.  Sounds good!  I hope it taste as good as it sounds lol.  I will update in a few! Oh emmmm it's delicious!! YES!!!"}
{"text":"I originally went to the Bowlology in San Clemente, CA. This location has a similar menu. I often get the \"Aloha\" with cashews - it is soo yummy & unique in that it has peaches in the smoothie acai mix. The girls are usually nice & the place is pretty fast in turnaround time.  Please consider having walnuts as another topping option in the future! The cashews are wonderful, though."}
{"text":"Came in last night on my way to Costco .. I was thinking it was somewhere I can get a Poke bowl per yelp reviews which they have a very limited selection of ..they didn't have shrimp or spicy tuna or any of the other stuff we can find normally at poke places so i chose to opt out and get a juice #5 with greens and #3 with beets the cups were $7each!!!! For a normal small drink cup!!! :/....so spent $14 !!!...walked out after couple minutes with my drinks and i saw the denser liquid on bottom was juice mostly and top was the greens it grossed me out a little . not worth the $ ."}
{"text":"The Berry Good lives up to it's name!!  A regular is the perfect size, they are generous with their servings.  The service was good and quick.  Place is clean with plenty of places to sit, even a large group."}
{"text":"Tried his place finally last Thursday, poke bowl was so delicious. Glad I finally went. Would of given it 5 stars but I swear I stood at the counter wondering if the staff even noticed I was there. Some girl sitting to the side got up and walked toward the register area and said \"can one of you please help this customer\". Yeah thanks to her I finally got someone from the back to come up front and take my order. (Mind you there were only 4 customers in the store me included.) Honestly should've walked out since they didn't seem to care, but I had really wanted to try the poke bowl and I was starving. Think they'd be more attentive. Next time I won't be so patient."}
{"text":"The Acai fruit (along with other superfoods) has gained a lot of attention recently.  That's okay when places like Acai To the T appear on the scene.  Only recently opened, this place seems to know what it wants to be:  your neighborhood shop to get your Acai or Pitaya fix in the form of bowls, smoothies and juice.  So far it's been a great experience.  Go in and you'll find yourself in a simple place with a trendy air about it, and a very nice staff.  The ladies who work behind the counter are super personable and do a good job of remembering returning customers.  The bowls come in two sizes, but don't be fooled, the regular size is filling.  You have a number of menu choices for what goes in your bowl.  If you're in the mood for a smoothie, you can also go that route, along with a number of additives to enhance your order.  The ladies will also let you substitute fruits on top if you need to, or prefer.  The only odd thing about the store is where the menu is located and where to order.  Don't sweat it:  walk in, go to the back, look at the large menu, then proceed to the register to order and pay.  No big deal.  They'll work out the signage and flow, I'm sure.  You can enjoy your order right there or take it to go.  Just grab a lid from the counter if you need to bolt.  If your plan is to sit a while, keep in mind there's very limited seating inside the shop.  If you like Acai or Pitaya, give this place a try.  If you're looking for a recommendation, try the Berry Good or Rise and Shine bowls.  I think your mouth will be happy!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time & ordered the small Rise & Shine acai bowl. It has mango & pineapple blended with the acai. In addition it has sliced strawberries, sliced bananas, honey, & of course the granola. Not sure what's in the granola & honey, but it was delicious. The consistency of the acai was not thin at all. I definitely recommend this place & plan on coming back for another breakfast on the go. They are fairly new, so I can tell the staff is still learning in the works. It took at least 10 minutes to make the bowl. The price was between $7-8 for the small bowl. I forget the comparison with other acai places, but for the price of this, it's worth the tasty freshness & antioxidants ;)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Since we wondered in by accident three weeks ago, we've gone back at least once a week! Customer service has been A++++ each and every time and even though all three of us have ordered the same bowl each time, each and every time it has been awesome!"}
{"text":"Love it! One of my favorite spots when it comes to a healthy meal or sweet craving. The options are endless and now they offer pokè bowls."}
{"text":"I am completely in love with this place. I have noticed the summerlin location has more on the menu but I love the refreshing healthy aspect of the hula bowl. I think it's worth it to get a large when I'm substituting it for dinner. It is very filling and it makes me feel like I am so cheating!"}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience here! The girls up front where very helpful finding the right bowl for us and made sure we knew everything that it contained before it was made. Used to go to Juice N Go often but I think this might have to be my new spot!"}
{"text":"Nothing too crazy about this place in my opinion. They have decent acai or pitaya bowls! They're all delicious and fruity from the ones I've tried. There's no uniqueness to it or specific taste that stands out to me personally, which is why I think it's a decent place! The place has a lot of space and the wall decorations are quite neat!   Picture should be posted on @livingphamtastic Instagram!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We've been going to this place a lot and absolutely love it! The Acai bowls are delicious especially the PB lover! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about this place for at least a year now.  I finally tried today and they definitely lived up to my expectation.  I got a large pitaya Hula bowl with extra coconut.  When I say large, I actually mean huge.  This could have fed two or three people but obviously I ate it all in one sitting by myself because it was delicious.  Slightly pricey but I am willing to pay for it since you know you're getting good quality fresh fruit.  They do a UNLV student discount which brought mine to about $10 so I think she charged me for asking for a little extra coconut which sucks a little since it's already on the bowl I just wanted a little bit more but I understand where they are coming from.  Overall, they provide a great clean and welcoming atmosphere and delicious healthy-ish food.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I agree with the earlier review being too sweet. Got the hula acai bowl. Not much acai flavor, too much sugar. They must use sweetened almond milk, candy coconut, and cheap honey. They don't use good granola either, more like a granola cereal. So it's riddled with that puffy rice stuff. Gotta comment on the trend in Vegas of using chocolate chips in place of superfood cacao nibs. It's cheap, don't do it. If you want a tasty treat, cool. You want a healthy snack, walk on by"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my new addiction. I'd give it 5 stars if the price was a bit lower. The place is always clean  They give military discount"}
{"text":"Love having more acai bowl choices in the area. If you haven't had one, it's basically an acai or Pitaya (fruit) smoothie base, topped with chopped fruit, seeds, granola, chia, honey. They also have smoothies, better for you than the chain smoothies (no turbinado sugar added). They have fresh vegetable/fruit juices. They menu is well laid out so it isn't confusing for newcomers."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Perfect healthy and delicious breakfast place for smoothie bowls. My favorite thing to order is the kids chocolate dream because the other sizes are a bit much for me. Staff is friendly and place is clean and welcoming. They also offer cold water refreshments which I haven't seen in any cafe for a very long time.   BONUS: 10% off for UNLV students!  Everything is incredible but I do wish they would post calorie counts online or have a sheet.  And they should offer other flavors for kids size because as of right now they only offer two !"}
{"text":"Love these bowls. Service is hit and miss.  A little pricey, but filling.   The açaí is delicious"}
{"text":"I unfortunately found bowlology to be seriously lacking in flavor...at least compared to other poke bowl places.I got the spicy tuna bowl on a bed of sushi rice with extra fish and seaweed salad on top. My favorite thing about the bowl I must say I really really loved the pickled cucumbers on the top as well as the onions added into the bowl. Unfortunately that was the only thing I loved....the tuna was bland and the rice didn't taste like sushi rice....it was just a sticky textured white rice. Also I like my spicy tuna to have a kick and the sauce tasted like it was trying to be spicy but it wasn't. It was a good sized bowl but it wasn't worth it to me due to the fact I couldn't muster myself to finish it. If you like portion of flavor this place is for you! Sorry Bowology you just didn't make the cut on my ahi poke list."}
{"text":"I have been here previously and had their acai bowl, and it was just awesome. I came back to try out their poke bowls, but was a little disappointed. You are given the option of choosing your base (cabbage, rice, or spring mix salad) and then you choose your poke. I ordered the spicy shoyu with the cabbage. They messed up my order and gave me the bowl with spring mix instead, which was fine just a little disappointing. The sauce that came with it was also overly salty to the point where I had to completely avoid the sauce after a while. BUT the poke itself was extremely fresh and good quality, as were all the other ingredients. We mentioned the mix up after and they gave us a card to get a free acai bowl next time, so they were very nice about it."}
{"text":"If vegan (maybe vegetarian? I don't remember everything on the menu) smoothie parfaits are your thing this place is for you! I went there for the first time (5 mins before closing accidentally! I'm so sorry!) but they were so sweet and helpful! I would definitely reccomend this place :)"}
{"text":"Fruits and Veggies keeps the doc away they say. Stopped in to try their bowls out. The place is small but has a cool Little vibe to it. The girls were very nice behind the counter. As to what I came for. I ordered their Ocean Bowl and added coconut shavings(which weren't added) It had some kiwi watermelon strawberries honey and granola And I asked for pitaya instead of acai. Flavors weren't bad but it definitely didn't taste organic and some of the fruits tasted old while other pieces were still frozen. So boo can't say I thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I love this place so much everything is so fresh and good and people there are very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"So stoked I found this place while staying at the red rock casino. The employees were educated on products they were serving. I will definitely be back. Great for after hiking."}
{"text":"Establishment is clean and well-kept. Prices are high, but aren't all \"acai-bowl restaurants\" with high quality ingredients a little pricey? I like that they also offer gold pressed juices/shots AND vegan options.  I knocked one star off the rating because the lack of customer service. Walked in here for the first time tonight and it seemed like I was somehow bothering them by wanting to place my order. Other than that, great spot!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. Great acai bowls and poke bowls. Always clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"Love the açaí bowls! If you're looking for something a little less sweet try the pitaya, great taste with a little tanginess to it. The fruit always comes out fresh and the bowl always look Instagram worthy."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bowls are awesome and the staff is very helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I wish all the locations linked somehow but I love the ocean bowl it's so good. The customer service is great and they have stamp cards ask for one. This time I got the smaller size abs discovered it's the perfect size. I always have a hard time finishing the large size so the small size it is for now on."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. I love love love their acai bowls. I had the ocean and it was so delicious. I hadn't found a good acai place in vegas but I finally did. Everyone should try this place if you get the large it's really filling keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great bowls they are so good and the workers are so friendly. Definitely recommend trying them. They also have a lot of paleo products for all you paleo out there. They also have punch cards a must get item."}
{"text":"Wasn't great in my opinion. Girl at the front taking my order was rude, but the guy in the back was nice. $8 regular bowl (pretty small) for only 3 toppings isn't the greatest deal. The bowl was really watered down. You'll get more bang for your buck ordering a large acai bowl at Jamba Juice for the exact same price as their regular!"}
{"text":"It was New Year's Day and I just want a good lunch to go before I go to work. I got the poke bowl and it was swimming in a sour sauce! I had to throw it away. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Great quality! I got a tuna bowl and the Kiwi Berry smoothie, both were fantastic! The prices are a little steep but for the quality and freshness of food, I think it's worth it! The smoothie was probably the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Hooray to this location arriving on the North side of town. I am trying to eat healthier and stay away from animal products, but a girl can only eat so much oatmeal before she needs to have something a bit more filling. Now with Acai to a T I have a few more breakfast/snack options.  The place is small and simply decorated, but big enough to enjoy one of their bowls, smoothies, or juices with a friend or small group of people.  I do like the fact that there is a window so that you can peek into the kitchen and watch your order be created. There are many toppings to chose from to add to your bowl which can make for tons of fun when satisfying your cravings. Just be mindful to check all the items that are included in each bowl if you have any type of dietary restrictions.  So stop by and grab yourself a bowl of fruit flavors- your tummy will thank you."}
{"text":"The bowls are pretty hefty so I wouldn't recommend getting the large unless you are very hungry. I see a lot of people having conversations in there, but I honestly don't know how they do it. It's super loud when the kitchen staff uses the blender. Though I'm sure it's not feasible, I would suggest investing in equipment that doesn't make as much noise. Don't come here thinking you can catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"Delicious! & they are right next door to yogurt land. Which most vegans can't go to so this is a perfect snack for vegans with a sweet tooth!  Most Acai places I have been to only offer one size, this place doesn't. And the prices for the bowls are very reasonable for what you get. I definitely will be back. This"}
{"text":"Well... this place had potential. HAD being the key word. I had some time before class and hit LVAC early. I was craving a smoothie and LVAC was a no go on vegan protein so I decided to try out this place. They have a pretty decent menu...   I ordered the chocolate smoothie... it had almonds, chocolate almond milk, cocoa, and banana. I opted out of the chocolate almond milk and asked for vanilla instead... Up charged. I asked for spinach instead of almonds... Up charged. And I asked for vegan protein... which I was up charged for and totally fine with. My smoothie costed almost 11 dollars. I don't have a problem spending money... but I do have an issue getting ripped off. I won't be back... the simple swap of different flavors of almond milk didn't constitute an up charge... and almonds are more expensive than a handful of spinach... if I knew I was going to be up charged... I would have ADDED spinach and left the almonds alone. Yeah... I won't be back."}
{"text":"I called 3 times in between 8:30-8:50pm to order for pick up and no one answered. When I came in I called again because I was curious if I had the wrong number or if they were just ignoring me. Surprisingly the phone was really loud and they were ignoring my phone calls. I wanted to pre order specifically because it was almost closing time and I figured it would be easier on them. Besides not answering the phone the acia bowls are amazing!!   The owner immediately responded to my review and looked into the matter. I appreciate an owner that strives for good customer service. I initially rated 2 stars but after eating the delicious bowl and the prompt response from the owner, this place deserves a 4!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now first when it was acai to the t and now. The inside decor is super cute and simple. Both times the young ladies made sure to acknowledge me to let me know they would be right with me. There was only two people working and they were obviously busy but handled the rush well.  I've had just the acai bowls but my favorite is the hula. It is pretty sweet but i like it. And considering the size and healthy ingredients I think the price is fair.   Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Favorite is the Green Machine. Looks like a green veggie shake... Tastes NOTHING like that! When it's dinner time and hit this could be the best place in Vegas to hit for lunch!"}
{"text":"The product is excellent, I love it . Unfortunately, the service is horrible !  Employees are always goofing off and socializing in the back and even in the lobby.   It appears the owner or manager is a young man and doesn't mind how they present themselves. Almost as if they expect the clients to return based on the product alone. Poor business etiquette .   They are lucky they have a good product, as this is the only reason they get return customers.  The high school kids alone aren't gonna be able to keep the place open. Oh and 15 minutes is way too long with make a acai bowl . They really need to step up their game before the buzz will be out of biz"}
{"text":"Yummy bowls, and I love the great selection of choices!  I'm not sure why the going rate for these bowls is so high; this place is right there with everyone else."}
{"text":"Fresh smoothies that are reasonably priced - we came in 20 minutes before they closed and they took our order!  The only turn off of this place was that we weren't greeted when we walked in the door and felt out of place and weren't sure if they were going to serve us."}
{"text":"2nd time I've come here and they don't have anything for the nut milk drinks they advertise. Probably won't be back. :(  Reviewed this almost 3 weeks ago...for shiggles, I called twice since then (about a week apart) and AGAIN they still have no nut milks. Highly disappointing for folks trying to steer clear of dairy."}
{"text":"I visited the store tonight and they definitely provided exemplary service.   As always the bowls are delicious! I cannot wait to introduce my friends to this place!"}
{"text":"If anyone needs a refreshing Acai Bowl, Bowlology is the place to go!  Very clean shop and very friendly employees!  They have a variety of Acai/Pitaya bowls as well as create you own! And they now serve poke bowls! How awesome is that!  Very generous portions, enough for 2 people with the Large cup!  Definitely going back since it's so near my house!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to stop in for a healthy breakfast! I had the ocean bowl and it was so bomb, easily the best one I've had thus far! The inside is simple with a few tables and t.v in the corner. It's got a spacious parking lot and is right next to Unlv which is a very convenient location. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place for açaí bowls at a great price! I call my order ahead of time now ... and services is great!"}
{"text":"We usually go to a Juice shop in Mountains edge area to get poke bowls. We had decided to try someplace new and stopped here. Very disappointed! Poke bowls had only 3-4 ingredients. I chose a spicy one and it basically tasted like salty teriyaki sauce. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Loved this place I think I got the chocolate dream bowl. Whatever it was it was excellent! Their sizes are huge so don't get a large unless you are going to share. 15% off for military hooah!!! Also great customer service. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming to this bowlology since it has been open. We love the bear bowl and always have had good service. Today we finally decided to collect our free bowl from the punch card. When we entered, the employee was speaking with what appeared to be an apparent customer who immediately walked out as we entered. She looked at me in a nasty manner as we approached the ordering counter. Unsure if it was because we separated her from her friend or the fact that she actually had to work? We ordered our two bears bowls where she advised us that the bear bowls are not available as the free option with the card, where I then began to ask which bowls can I get to collect. She returned the card and did not allow us to change our order.  Overall we love the products here except today we received very poor and rude service which will affect our return to this location if this employee is still there."}
{"text":"okaaaau my last update since they fired home boy my acai bowls is on point they stopped playing and trying to rip me off so they deserve there 5 stars back  the manager and Dakota  are just such peaches some of the girls are annoying and don't make my bowl right but I'm glad I rarely get em."}
{"text":"I refuse to come to this location now. Staff is always rude and stuck up, plus they put a lot less fruit and granola in my acai bowls than the centennial location."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to your pitaya bowls!! Centennial location always puts enough granola and fruit in them and the staff is always usually very pleasant! My new favorite place for acai/pitaya bowls EDIT: after going enough times to the centennial one I've experienced a fair share of all their employees.... A lot of them very nice but still a select few who are sour pusses. Idk what's up with the ownership at Acai to a T but they seriously hire THE WORST sourpuss attitude having employees!! IF YOURE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC AND CUSTOMER SERVICE... CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE"}
{"text":"Great looking location.  I only had the paradise smoothie which was delicious, be careful though, the ginger really pulls through.  Will be back for those acai bowls!"}
{"text":"bestest acai  bowls, juices, and smoothies in summerlin! If it's your first time try the rise n shine."}
{"text":"This was my first time at bowlology and I really enjoyed it! The employees were very nice. I got a smoothie and it was extremely thick. I ended up having to give it to my husband as it tasted like the smoothies we make at home, which is a good thing because we make them from scratch, but I was looking for more of a sweetened taste. This place is great though. Next time I'll order a acai bowl! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was really trying not to get into this by the looks but the taste and quality is an amazing meal replacement or just afternoon delight. Have fun making changes for your tasting. Sooo good"}
{"text":"Rude not friendly at all. No smile, gave me my food and said, \"here.\" Umm no! When someone is paying $45 for 2 smoothies and 2 poke bowls at least be curteous and nice. The young lady was above rude. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"I have had Jamba Juice acai bowls and loved it so I decided to give this place a try. I had ocean and PB.  I got a regular size bow each time and I am shocked by how full I got after eating only half of it.  This bowl is perfect size as a meal. Fresh fruit(s) is a plus. I hate when people use frozen fruit as a topping. Bowl was blended well and made perfectly each time. Friendly staff and Malina (who made my bowl) is da bomb!!!  I can't wait to try the other bowls.  On a side note, I noticed that the logo is similar (the ology with the leaf) to shakeology and wonder if they are somehow affiliated although I do not think they are."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hula in a regular size container. It was absolutely delicious it was all my favorite flavors (minus red velvet and cheesecake) in one container my only disappointment is that no one (not even my husband) urged me to get the bigger size. What was he thinking? My husband ordered the large PB and his mistake was waiting until we got home to eat it... He had dinner then tried to eat it but was too full so I willing sacrificed myself by finishing his. :)   My husband introduced me to acai bowls on Monday, Feb. 29, 2016... He has created a monster. I need this in my life daily. I live on the East side and have already started looking for homes nearby. I'm not kidding. My husband said it can't happen but I have every intention of finding a way, after all, where there is a will, there is a way. But, if I should find my mission a failure; do you deliver?"}
{"text":"First time going there. This place use to be a yogurt store when I use to work next door at sprint! The inside is so nice and different more of a chill vibe feel! I ended up getting the Berry Good Acai bowl my boyfriend got the superwoman! Everything tasted great and I loved my bowl!   Why 3 stars though? Well customer service needs to be more up to par! The guy who took my order was not friendly and the vibe given was like he did not want to be there! This business will do fantastic but the employees there need to be more nice so everyone can have a 5 star service! All in all I will come back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the acai is a 5 star. I love this place. But the customer service is terrible. There were 5 kids working and I got my bowl fairly quickly (although my order was wrong but I didn't mind really) 30 minutes later and we were STILL waiting for my husbands. We watched 2 employees make their own orders and leave before working on customers orders. It was just a bunch of kids kicking it together, not people who took their jobs seriously. Shout out to the kid for giving us our money back and making the situation right while his friends goofed off though! Thanks bro!"}
{"text":"Ah man such a let down . I'll start with the positives , the toppings on my Acai bowl were great , plenty of fresh fruit and honey. The presentation is great, and the size is good too. But the acai itself was really mediocre at best. First it was frozen (not near the right consistency) and second it lacked flavor, just a very bland acai . We used to frequent acai to the t before they bought them out and their acai was way better and way more authentic . This Honestly tasted like the acai packs you buy at Costco ?."}
{"text":"Best açai bowls in the area! Some places make you add on chia and hemp, but this is kinda all-inclusive, as it comes in the granola. In love with the Ocean Cup bowl. The base consists of açai, pineapple, mango, and strawberries. It was topped with kiwi, strawberries, granola, and honey. (They give you the option to choose açai or pitaya.) The atmosphere was quiet and it smelled like fruity deliciousness. 10/10 breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"Its like Bogarts or Island Vintage in Oahu... A small piece of home is here in Vegas  Good texture acai and healthy amount of berries. Even if really hungry I'd suggest the regular size, it's very filling."}
{"text":"I had the ocean acai bowl. It ran me about $8 for a regular but I was full at the end of it. The ingredients are good for you and the bowl was delicious once the fruits and granola were mixed. The taste was outstanding and service top notch. It did take a little bit to make the bowl but overall I was satisfied with my meal. Thy have about 10 options depending on the fruit or base you want so you'll definitely be able to find a dish to try. They also have poke bowls and smoothies which could be a good option for next time I come to. Bowlology."}
{"text":"Always friendly and pretty fast service considering they make everything fresh. I usually will call in an offer and they have it ready for me to pick up. My favorite is the bear bowl all the way."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 3.5-4 star rating for this establishment. I had a very good experience walking in, seeing how cute this place was and even ordering my pitaya bowl. It wasnt until I realized I had been waiting 20 min for my pitaya bowl and noticed a bunch of people getting their order that was after me.  I went up to the front to let the cashier know, however his response was, \"I cant put a time on it, it comes out when they are done making it.\"  How about no, you guys forgot about my order or prob. gave it to someone else? When I told him I saw people getting their order who ordered after me he assured me that I'd be getting it soon.  When I got my PB lover Pitaya bowl I thought it was delicious. It wasnt the best I've ever had (the best I had was in NYC)... but it certainly is something I know I can come back for."}
{"text":"great product and very cute store, but also very over priced for the size of serving you get! Unfortunately I won't  be returning. I prefer to get more for the same price at JuiceNGo off of Oakey & Rainbow."}
{"text":"OK... So I come here all the time now. Best açai bowl, in my opinion. The customer service is still hit and miss, but I have never had as bad of an experience as my first one."}
{"text":"Tried the Superman Bowl yesterday with protein and tried the pitaya bowl today both are really good the facilities are clean the workers are nice and inviting I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Found a hair on my bow :( first time coming here but the girls where very kind and nice and quickly replaced my order with new one. They do have to put there hair back though"}
{"text":"Delicious! It will be really refreshing to go there on a HOT summer day! I've tried Ocean and Chocolate Dream"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but prices are way high. It's delicious tho so I guess it's worth it. The AC wasn't working I think cause it was so hot."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for the longest time since it's near my house. I wanted to try one of their açaí bowls but when I realized that they now had poke bowls, I HAD to get some. I got the OG tuna bowl with sushi rice and it was delicious!!! I saw a few pictures from previous customers and I was afraid they were going to skimp our on the tuna like the pictures but I really wanted it so I got it anyways. And boy am I glad I did! They gave me so much tuna!!!! It was so good and the tuna tasted fresh. I came back the week after to get another bowl : )"}
{"text":"Just tried this spot on a whim. Pleasantly surprised. Had the spicy shoyu poke bowl with an Invigorate Juice. So good! Excellent quick lunch! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place amazed me. I was so happy with the acai bowl I had. I've tasted numerous acai bowls in Vegas and I've always said, \"This is good, but it doesn't taste great like back home (Hawaii). However, this place was the one! I was so happy to finally find a bowl that had the same texture and taste back home in Oahu. The prices for their bowls aren't expensive as all the other places I've tried. The customer service is great. The guy was nice enough to let me try what they use for their bowl before ordering. Other than the taste, prices and customer service, the atmosphere was cute and warm. I adore eating at a place that has a cute vintage/hipster look. Haha. Makes the food more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best Pitaya bowl by far! My coworker & I were hungry during our lunch break and as we were driving by this place, we decided to stop in and give it a try. We were not disappointed! The entire wall to your left, upon walking in, has detailed descriptions of all the bowls that you can choose from, as well as the sizes. I opted for a PB bowl of some sort with Pitaya instead of Acai. **soooo good** The large size could definitely be shared among two people, so I'm happy I opted for a small, which I almost couldn't finish either!   I wish they had a closer location as this one is a little bit out of the way, but definitely if I'm in the area, this is the one place I want to go to!  They're in the process of changing their name too, so keep an eye out for the changes!"}
{"text":"Delicious acai bowls. Love the PB lover. Absolutely NOT overpriced for an acai bowl. Bowls in San Diego, LA and jersey are priced similarly. The location is new and service is great!"}
{"text":"This place was okay for me.  I was really craving a Poke Bowl and wanting Sweet Poke which was right next to them but they were closed.  I saw a sign that they had Poke Bowls.  The last few places I've been to that sold Poke Bowls was a lot more interesting than this place.  For me it was 2/5 stars.  The Poke was just basic Shoyu Poke with Sea Weed salad on top over brown rice.   I also ordered their I Love Acai smoothie.  That was decent as well.    I do want to come back to try the Acai Bowls.  Never had one before.  So I'll be back."}
{"text":"So grateful to have an acai bowl place close to where I live. This is a very simple, and straight forward. The menu is basic and the young ladies who work here are helpful if you do not understand on the menu or customizing your bowl. One thing, I wish they had is more options to chose from with the basic bowls they offer. Since adding sides add up pretty quickly. They offer great portion sizes and quick service."}
{"text":"Amazing place with quality bowls and quality customer service. My favorite is the feel good with vanilla almond milk or the body builder with chocolate almond milk."}
{"text":"Really fresh ingredients. A great way to get a healthy meal in at a reasonable price in a reasonable amount of time. Check it out. Super smoothies are money."}
{"text":"I love this place. The employees are always polite, the atmosphere is low key and never so crowded that you feel suffocated, it's always clean and most importantly, it's always delicious. I have not ventured too far out of my favorites zone but everything I have had is great. My personal favorite is the bear bowl. Will be trying a smoothie someday. Only minor complaint is that it's pricey but what do you expect for things made with fresh fruit? It is what it is. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I must be one of the only people who's often on the look out for a smoothie joint for something quick and nutritious to eat. Yeah, so the cost of a smoothie bowl here is \"expensive,\" but it's actually comparable to other places around town, like Jamba Juice and Nekter. Plus, there are regular and large bowl options, as well as a variety of toppings. MOVING ON.  I'm sticking to the Bear Bowl when I come here. It's perfect if you're hungry. If you're really hungry, order the large. This bowl is packed with protein, fruits, granola, and oh, just a small sprinkling of dark chocolate chips for some bittersweetness.   In addition to smoothies, there are juices, salads, and protein bowls on the menu. There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy! Great service and am amazing vibe! Helpful and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I came here to get açaí bowls with my friends after hiking. I got the makai bowl which included açaí, banana, strawberries, blueberries, and granola. Everything tasted great, however about 1/4 of the bottom of my bowl was filled with granola (see picture). There wasn't the normal ratio of açaí to toppings. By the time I finished the bowl, there was a bunch of granola left so I just threw it away.   I wasn't sure if this was how it was supposed to be made. As I watched everyone else in the store pick up their order, they all had the normal amount of açaí/Pitaya at the bottom of their bowl with toppings on top. I even went to another Bowlology location and they said it shouldn't have been made like that. I'm not sure what happened or if this is how this particular location makes the makai bowl."}
{"text":"I miss acai to the T. Bowlology is great and all but you guys really downgraded on the portions man :(((( I want to love-love it ya know. Overall- tastes bomb tho. Got the usual PB lover pitaya bowl."}
{"text":"They need more employees on shift because this place gets slammed and they only ever have 2 people working.   Decent pitaya and acai bowls! It's hard for me to find good acai bowls because nothing compares to the deliciousness of Pressed for Juice acai bowl.   Buuuut I come here because they offer pitaya and most places don't have that option. My favorite is the peanut butter pitaya bowl. It's so goooood. Their regular size is a lot, I don't think I've ever finished one completely."}
{"text":"First off the place is clean, good location(right across from UNLV) and the staff was nice. I was disappointed there is no calorie break down of the food or drinks; had there been I may have gone with the large of the drink I chose or gotten something more. I got the regular size Going Green for lunch. I'm trying to drop some pounds! Overall the drink was good. Not too sweet and it tasted fresh. Could have been colder, it was kinda room temp. Overall, I'll come back the next time I'm down in this area."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a healthy breakfast I decided to try the blue crush bowl the regular size and it made me full for hours I think I wouldn't be able to finish the large size. It tasted very good and fresh. They have a big menu and I'm excited to explore it with every visit. The place was nice and clean. The staff was nice and very fast I didn't wait long for my order the only thing is I felt a little rushed when placing my order it was my first time here so I was a little overwhelmed by the menu but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great. Only complaint is the last time we were here there was a non service dog inside the store at the tables, which is really gross."}
{"text":"Got the blue crush bowl  soooooo good!!! We also got two smoothies and they were loved as well. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.   The place was clean, and the employees were kind and quick! My kind of place."}
{"text":"I come here often, mostly because it's more convenient than most of the other smoothie/acai spots. The bowls (fruit & food) are always consistent in taste which is nice. The LACK of smiles among the employees is also consistent...which is not so cool. All of the girls are so pretty it would really help if they didn't have such sour looks on their faces all the time."}
{"text":"Ive always avoided chain Açaí bowl spots but I was desperate and they didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here recently with my bio buddy. She was hungry & I'm always down to try something new so we decided to check it out. According to my young & adorable friend this place is very popular with her sorority sisters. In the spirit of sorority girls everywhere (too old to have that experience lolol) we both got acai bowls!  My friend got the Hula bowl & I got the Chocolate Dream both in regular size. The serving size is huge & costs about 8 bucks. They were both more or less the same just that hers had coconut sprinkles on top & mine had chocolate chips. Each bowl was filled with delicious strawberries, bananas, granola, & of course the acai base. I couldn't finish the entire thing because it was so much sweetness but overall I thought it hit the spot, especially since I lugged all of my books across the street from UNLV to get here & it was a pretty hot day. Perfect dessert spot for someone who's looking for a slightly healthier dessert choice. It seems like they serve food here as well. They do have an easily accessible parking lot in your typical Vegas style mini mall. Poke shop, tacos, & other restaurants near by if you want more dinner type foods first.   I will say that if you want to chat with your friends, don't come here on a busy day or take your bowl to go because we couldn't hear each other talking while they were blending them. Overall  I enjoyed it & could see myself coming here again. Great for college students as its right across the street from campus & great for people who love their fruit like I do."}
{"text":"My husband and I had pizza and brownies last night and I woke up feeling not so good. I used to live in San Diego and acai bowls were everywhere. Not the case in Vegas. I had to drive 25 minutes to get to bowlology which I found on an article posted on Facebook about healthy places to eat in Vegas.   I ordered the Hula bowl, it was delicious and I felt great. It was 8.10 with tax for the regular size. Maybe it was a little more expensive then when I lived in San Diego but worth every penny.  I hope they open a location closer to me. I'm in southern highlands. I ordered one to go for tomorrow but now sure how it will hold up, this is the kind of food to be eaten when you buy it.   I had to wait a few minutes for the second one I ordered and they gave me a couple of coupons for a free ones for my wait. I will definitely go back whether or not they did that but it was nice that they did do that anyway."}
{"text":"Refueling my body after lifting weights and leg day. The hula bowl is by far my favorite. You can get it with Acai or Pitaya. Also got the pink flamingo and sunset drink to go for later."}
{"text":"I have been here four times. Each time I have been the staff has treated me like sh**. I always say thank you and smile, but it's like I am talking to a suicidal brick wall; I am not exaggerating either. The place is run by a gang of unappreciative, teenage jerks who treat me like crap every time. It's pretty fucking offensive. this is coming from someone who put their time in the retail world. I'm not the kind of person who likes small talk either but a how are you wouldn't hurt. Hell, this place isn't even that busy lol. Your staff sucks. It's too bad your acaï is good. I am not coming back."}
{"text":"I just came here for a quick smoothie bowl afternoon pick me up. This is my second time coming to a Bowlology in a different location and the quality was consistent. Last time, I got the Rise and Shine and this time I got the Ocean. I personally feel not much of a difference between the two bowls.   I always get the Pitaya here, which is dragon fruit compared to the açaí, and I like this because it's less sweet. The regular topping comes with a generous portion of granola, which I personally don't like so I now ask for less granola. I also don't feel the honey adds much other than extra sweetness which I feel that the bowl doesn't need.   Overall, I like the blended fruit portion of the bowl, but I would suggest switching up the toppings and adding more variety. I would love to see toppings like mango, raspberries, and peaches. I also think it would be yummy to have soaked chia seeds incorporated into the bowls.   For the quality and what you get, I do feel that this place it a bit overpriced since a small is roughly $9 before tax and $12 for a large but I would definitely come back here if I'm in the mood for a relatively healthy treat."}
{"text":"Love it here. I guys that work here make it better than the girls. The girls are usually in conversation with each other more than not. The guys do their jobs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in a few days ago and we both ordered the PB Lover. We both thought it was delicious, but the regular sized container was a bit too much for us. I definitely recommend it if you have a huge appetite! Definitely coming back to try out other stuff from the menu! :)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here, it was a bit confusing where to order, the menu is towards the back of the cafe.   The staff wasn't so friendly, the ambiance of the cafe was chill.   I had the \"Feel Good\" Pitaya bowl & it was delicious."}
{"text":"Loved the bowls here! Everyone was super nice and the place is super clean and I loved the style of the layout and furniture and decor of the place. They did a great job with the store"}
{"text":"The ocean acai bowl is amazing. The tuna bowls, however, were terrible. There is a poke place in the same shopping center that is WAY better. The rice was so dry and the bowl lacked flavor. Just stick to the acai bowls here"}
{"text":"Love their products.   Staff is always pleasant and helpful.  Eat there at least 2 to 3 times a week."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly delicious!  I went here with my wife and we decided to try the poke. I ordered the spicy shoyu and my partner did the build your own. I also ordered the PB lover for later on.   The poke was really good, the spice was very light it could use more kick but all the ingredients in the bowl made the tuna very tasty. I liked what my wife made but they put too much mayo in it.  I tried the PB lover super bowl and it was soo good!! It has the strawberry with banana peanuts and chocolate. I was not expecting it to be so great because the last Superbowl I tried tasted like vitamins.   Definitely will come back to try more and take my sister as well!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  I went here to grab lunch after a workout.  The website shows protein bowls etc... They only have fruit bowls and poke bowls. So I ordered a   Spicy poke bowl with brown rice, they said the rice cooker was broken so no rice. They have no chicken bowls, tofu or any other protein. I guess it is really a juice bar!  Why is it called Bowlology!?  Will not return"}
{"text":"After moving back from San Diego I was craving a real acai bowl. This place was awesome. So many options. All delicious. Definitely satisfied my craving. I may be coming back here every morning. The workers are sweet and work to make exactly what you want."}
{"text":"I've been on an Açaí Bowl kick lately. I can't get enough. The topping choices are endless and I love trying all sorts of combos. My coworkers in my office noticed my new obsession and surprised me with two coupons to give Bowlology a whirl. I was stoked!    Ambiance:   Order at counter.  Open seating.  Pick a table and plop down.  The ambience is open, airy and clean.  I loved their bench/table seating combo.  We were catching up on some emails and needed to get some work done.  We liked how each table had a charging station/usb to plugin.  They also offer free wifi.  Ask one of their 'bowlisitas' for their wifi code.  Ambiance: 4 stars   Service:   The gal at the counter was friendly.  I showed up today with my coworker in tow.  I explained I had received our coupons to give them a try.   She showed me my options and we were able to use them without a problem.  Service: 5 stars   Food:   We both ordered the Hula Bowl in their regular size at 16oz each.  You have a choice of Açaí or Pitaya as your base. I tried Pitaya and she ordered her bowl with Açaí.  The base is then blended with peaches, pineapple, mango, banana & vanilla almond milk.  Our toppings: sliced strawberries, bananas, coconut flakes, granola, and a drizzle of honey.   We both enjoyed our bowls. My coworker stated hers was sweeter than others she's tried.  My pitaya version wasn't overly sweet and I really enjoyed the honey and coconut flakes.  We both enjoyed our bowls and will put bowlology on our rotation.  Food: Solid 4 stars  Overall:   Everything was good.  This is a solid spot to grab an Açaí Bow.  I noticed they offer Poke Bowls and will have to come give that a try.  I like that they have a loyalty stamp card program.    Overall: 4 stars  Yelp Review #27 2016"}
{"text":"This Bowlology location leaves something to be desired in the service department. I visited this location twice, and each time I was left with a MEH-taste in my mouth. No smile, no greeting, no welcome in upon entering on each visit.   The bowls we ordered were fine. However, I found other Bowlology locations and competitor locations to be far superior. I will opt out of visiting this location to frequent other spots in town.    We ordered these various bowls during my visits:   Rise and Shine Bowl- Granola, Strawberry, Banana Slices, and Honey over an Acai Base    Hula Bowl - Strawberry, Banana Slices, and Coconut Shavings over a Pitaya base  Ocean Bowl - Watermelon, Kiwi, Strawberries, Granola and Honey over an Acai Base  On the bright side, the store is well kept and clean. It is conveniently located next to Trader Joe's in the greater Centennial area."}
{"text":"Was craving acai bowl that we even drove a great distance just to get it from here having a good experience the first time we came. Soon as we pull up girl came running to lock the door, we missed it just by 5 minutes. We asked for service but they can't make an exemption. Bummed! I work in the restaurant business and I would have taken the business because it ensures positive feedback, return business and word of mouth. 5 stars for their product 1 star for service. Won't be coming to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Yum Açai bowls! They make them right at this location. Friendly service. Lots of options to choose from. They even serve pitaya.  I ordered the rise and shine. Pretty standard bowl but it was wonderful. It was home away from home. It was that good.   I liked the design of the shop and the decor. It was homey and a comfy feel.  There was no one else there beside my friend and I at 5:00pm. This was going to be my dinner.   Service was awesome. I asked for a little more granola when I got to the bottom of my bowl and even offered to pay a little more. The kids there let me have a scoop on the house. Super kind and they didn't have to do that. I would be a loyal customer if I lived in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Best acai bowls ever. I come here at least 5 times a week. The only down side is the customer service. I have never once been greeted when I walk in and I rarely \"get a have a good day\" when they have me the food. I must say I've worked and still work in the food industry and I feel it is unexplainable why a simple hello is hard to do. And I tip every time. There is 2 guys in there every few times and they are pretty nice compared to all the girls"}
{"text":"This place has had good customer service. I love the Acai bowls especially the Hula one, however I do find it a bit overpriced. But I like it to much to stop going. It is always freshly made and delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing bowls for a fair price. I really enjoy their set up and how friendly they are. I do wish they had a few more snacks but we can't have it all! I really recommend the dragon fruit (pitaya) bowl! Just delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff fresh food, great place for all you healthy eaters  Breakfast lunch or light dinner  Daily specials  I was lucky to get a free shot of ginger with my Hula bowl .. Super chill spot luv it"}
{"text":"Growing up in and being from Southern California - there are acai and smoothie shops everywhere.  This place is pretty good. The bowls are a little pricey, about 2$ more than I'm used to paying, and the toppings are limited from their pre-created bowls on the menu.  Right when you walk in, everything is a little too sterile. There needs to be something welcoming to the place. It's missing music. All you hear are the blenders. Get some reggae up in here, just any music at all and it would make it a great place to actually hang out.  Finally, the granola. It's one of the main aspects to every bowl. Their granola is a little cheap. It's a very puffed rice granola which is cheaper and doesn't pack as much nutrition when full pats are used.   Other than that, I will be coming back and suggest it - mostly would just appreciate some music :)"}
{"text":"I have only tried their blended bowls but  they are really good i love that they offer vegan hemp protien that can be added to any blended bowl."}
{"text":"This may become my new favorite place. What an amazingly creative space! The quote tree totally gave me life...the inspiration wall alone is worth the $8 smoothie charge. Oh, and my Hula Acai bowl was fabulous."}
{"text":"I was excited to return to this location and get the OG Poke bowl which I loved the first time I tried it.   However, after paying extra for more ahi (as I only had the original version the first time around), I only received the same amount as the first time I ate it. What am I paying extra for? And to top it off, this bowl had no taste as there was not enough sauce.   On a brighter note, the seaweed salad is delicious as I remembered it.   I guess it really depends on the workers making the Poke bowls.  DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's not HICravings (My opinion of a great acai bowl located in Hawaii), but it was good. It was different to have a blended/topping menu instead of a standard acai blend with various toppings. They recommended the Hula acai bowl. It was good. They have covers, spoons, straws, paper bags, and napkins available at the pick up window. There is ample seating and lots of parking."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  My new healthy obsession in  Summerlin! I found this place by accident a month ago and now I am a weekly regular.  The staff is on the young side, but I have found them to be friendly and helpful when asked.  I really like the Berry Good and the Body Builder. After reading reviews, I am also anxious to try different items.  The decor and atmosphere are clean and welcoming.  You should try this place or you are missing out!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty clean. The service was pretty quick because the place was pretty empty.   The large bowl WAS super huge. I couldn't finish the large. There was a nice chalk board to back to write a quote. They were playing some old school drake. I didn't know what radio station that was but that had some good Acai near by my casino from the Red Rock Casino."}
{"text":"So happy to see some family owned stores opening again in Vegas ! Interior is cute and efficient .. Helped by sweet high school students . The acai bowls are amazing and delicious with granola added to a creamy cold acai purée and topped with bananas / fruit / chocolate / honey .. Lots of options ! To me this is a meal .. The small is pretty filling. Great in Vegas where it's hot ! And you feel like you are doing your body good ."}
{"text":"Pretty bad customer service each and every time I come here, maybe the other location will be better"}
{"text":"There are many juice bars popping up in Las Vegas, but I always find myself coming back to Bowlology. They are consistent with their acai texture and flavor, the fruits are always fresh, and the employees are friendly and knowledgable. I usually get the Berry Good because I like the classic strawberry, blueberry, granola and honey toppings. Sometimes I spice it up and order the Chocolate Dream or Bear Bowl for the added protein and peanut butter flavor. In addition, they also have many other items like pitaya bowls, poke bowls, smoothies, fresh squeezed juices, coffee, and salads. If you're trying to eat healthier and incorporate more fruits & veggies in your diet, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The large was LARGE. Everything was delicious! Rise and Shine, the spinach one, and bear. Reasonably priced for the size!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious! Ordered the bear bowl. Acai, granola, tons of fruit, which I love...(blueberries, strawberries, banana) with honey drizzled on top. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Today my girlfriend I were in Summerlin and we wanted to have a healthy lunch. We stumbled upon this new place called Acai to the T. My girlfriend is vegan and was very impressed with the wide variety of options. The staff was friendly and let us sample the product while explaining the ingredients and background of the food. The menu had a lot of innovative food choices. We ordered the body builder and rising shine. It was delicious and we will defiantly be coming back. Much better then a smoothie.   P.s they had WiFI."}
{"text":"Fast service and excellently priced. Can also bring your laptop and study here if you wish to do so."}
{"text":"Delicious bowls like really really good... but it seems like they are NEVER open. I have tried to go here 3 Times!  Just so you know the are only open 9-6 m-f  Saturday is a mystery and CLOSED on Sunday."}
{"text":"UPDATE: this place is now bowlology!!!!!!!!!   By far the best place in Las Vegas to get Acai, and the closest thing to Hawaii Acai bowls. The ingredients are fresh, they give good portions and the staff are all really friendly and helpful. Highly recommend the Rise and Shine. Plus you could always customize it with their endless add on options. I just wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Sweet and healthy cravings have been satisfied! The fruit is fresh and the bowls are the perfect consistency. Third time here, and won't be my last!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. This is no longer Acaí to the T. They're menu has changed and it's a little more expensive.  Why would you replace coconut water with almond milk?!?  Why are you charging $8 and $10 for Almond milk and Apple Juice??? I might as well go to Jamba Juice or Tropical Smoothie because the value to ingredients is more worth it. Or drive 30min to a place that actually makes their own granola. I don't mind spending money on quality ingredients. Or I'll just wait to the next trip to Cali and visit BonzaiBowl."}
{"text":"Awesome açaí bowls! Definitely love all the freshness and so many choices to choose from."}
{"text":"Love the fruit bowls especially the PB lover the best one I think.  For the protein bowls I have had the spicy shoyu, they are just not good. No flavor, no sauce nothing. I wanted to try and love them so I bought the OG one today, same no flavor very bland nothing special about these bowls save yourself 10.99. Hopefully they can improve on the bowls and add some yum yum sauce or an eel sauce or at least offer on the side."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  The Pb lover with acai is the best.  If you love pb and banana and gronala this is for you.  Super reasonable pricing. I eat these all the time super filling fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Been here over 10 times in the last month and always have had a great experience.  Place is clean. Customer service is always on point and friendly. Bowls and Smoothies are always super delicious especially in this Vegas heat. The most I ever had to wait for a bowl while being busy is less than 7 minutes.  Recommend everyone to stop and try it once. My favorite is the Hulu so yummy!"}
{"text":"I had saw my friend come to class with an acai bowl from here and it looked so good I had to try it ASAP! I came here with a friend before class and we were both in shock on how good it was! The service was good, he answered all my questions I had since I was new. Also, I was pretty happy that the fruit was still fresh since I went near closing time. It was way more filling than I thought it would be! First time I tried an acai bowl and I'm glad it was here. Can't wait to try the other options next time!"}
{"text":"The most awful Poke bowl (if you even call it a poke bowl) I have ever had.  It was sooo salty, didn't have seaweed salad or ginger, and the portion was about 1/3 the size of your typical poke bowl.  Also only came with your choice (a small scoop) of 1 protein. I tried the tuna, which was fresh, but for the price ($11.91) I'd rather have had a burger and fries. You have to pay for almost every add on, which I was not willing to do, considering  their overpriced menu. Seriously, if you are looking for a good poke bowl, this is NOT the place."}
{"text":"Amazingly good. Always order from here when me and the wifey get a sweet craving and want to be healthy ;)"}
{"text":"Bowlology has been the go to place for me for acai bowls for the past year, but I've been disappointed the last few times I've gone. While it did take a while to get my order the last time, the main complaint is getting my order right. One time my bowl was made as a regular size when I ordered a large and the last time my makai bowl had only strawberries and granola in it, no bananas at all. I was so disappointed when I opened to eat my bowl at home. Additionally, it does seem the fruit toppings have decreased. With Vitality Bowls now open, it may now be the go to place for me for acai bowls."}
{"text":"I have been to Bowlology 5 times since they recently opened and I'm happy to see they have a Yelp page now!  I have been beyond satisfied on each visit. The bowls are delicious, the staff is great, and the prices are decent. I thought it was too expensive at first since I was new to acai bowls, but trying out other bowls around town has made me realize that Bowlology is far more reasonably priced. The price Bowlology charges for their large is in most cases less than what the other places charge for their smallest size.  I recommend the PB Lover. One of the girls always suggests pitaya instead of acai and it's definitely worth a try but I prefer the acai with this bowl. I try to eat vegan as much as possible and they are very accommodating to that, even checking labels for me and substituting ingredients when needed (ie. cacao powder for chocolate chips). The Green Machine and the Hula are also very good and I highly recommend them. All their bowls have a perfect, creamy texture. The bowls are also natural with no added sweeteners.  Me and my boyfriend are obsessed with this place. Try it out, I guarantee you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST acai in town...Scratch that best acai I've ever had! This is the purest form I've ever come across no need to blend it with anything ( unless you want to of course) don't waste your time or money on any other place Bowlology is the only place to go! Not to mention their staff is so friendly, I'm always greeted with a smile!"}
{"text":"Located right across unlv! Great location to grab some food off campus in between classes. This review is based on their poke bowl... Which was ok! People get poke bowls and expect the main component of it (fish) to be flavorful, which is unfortunately lacked  my bowl was basically a bowl with what tasted like boxed rice.. Ahi tunA.. And all of that drowned in soy sauce. With soggy onions.. And I paid $11. Skip the poke bowls.. I'd love to come back to try their acai bowls!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here but I saw the name and under it, it said \"Healthy Kitchen & Juice Bar\". Since it was lunch, I said why not. Well it's not really a kitchen like one that you could get a salad or something like that. It should be called fruit bowl and juice bar. Anyway, I decided to just order the \"energizer\" juice because even though I think all their juices probably taste good, I started with this one because I make it at home the most except I use the whole veggies and fruit. But I thought it was really good and look forward to coming here in the future. I don't think I'd recommend it for lunch though. But those leaving the gym, I suggest you stop here instead of the one at the gym. Share the wealth you cheap bastards don't give everything to 24hr fitness,    There not much into decor though. I've seen auto shops have similar looks.   But for juices, fantastic! But as always, judge for yourself and go by!!"}
{"text":"Looking for something to help stay cool this morning ran across this business. They do not sell the frozen yogurt that we were seeking, but the menu and business concept was very grabbing. The lobby of the restaurant was so cool with a chalk board encompassing a whole wall just full of love.   The menu is extensive and so original but we were not seeking breakfast just a cold treat to keep up cool. The smoothie menu is very original and I tried the Summer Love flavor with orange, strawberry, and wonderful watermelon. The juice smoothie was so refreshing and hit the spot too.   This is such a refreshing little juice bar that is very inviting. The menu prices are reasonable and they are promoting a healthy alternative to other types of food consumption. I was so happy to find them and will visit again. Now time to cool off with my summer love smoothie."}
{"text":"I had the PB Pitaya bowl, and I've got to say....NEVER in my LIFE, have I had such a delicious bowl before. I've had so many AcaiBowls, but this is definitely my top favorite. And what's a delicious spot without the GREAT customer service!? My first time at this place, and the staff were SO HELPFUL. Everything down to the amount of granola and honey was PER-FECT. As for that being said, I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've never had an acai bowl before and was on my way to the less healthy place next door when my friend suggested I try this. There are acai bowls, pitaya bowls, juices and smoothies. The nice guy behind the counter explained that pitayas are a little sweeter than acais so I went with that since the sweeter the better with me. I chose the \"Ocean Cup\" which is pataya, mangoes, pineapples and strawberries blended kinda like a sorbet. On top of that there's granola, sliced kiwis and strawberries. OMG it was really yummy! It is a tad on the pricey side, $6.99+tax (for a regular size) but I think healthier foods usually cost more. They do have a punchcard that earns you a free bowl after ten purchases so that's a plus to me. The inside of the store isn't very flashy but it's not meant to be a five star restaurant. Can't wait to return and try the PB Lover pitaya bowl!"}
{"text":"POKE BOWL!  I seek out clean eating that includes raw fish and I have found happiness and good health at Bowlology with their Poke Bowls.  I have actually never consumed one of their well known Acai Bowls or smoothies, but as for their poke bowl options, I am a fan.  I always include half brown rice and half spring mix greens as a base to the one of four options of poke bowls they sell.  They are always prepared fresh, they are always consistent in quantity and quality and I always get in and out with my take out order in 10 minutes or less.   The quality of the salmon and tuna are pretty good and/or better compared to other restaurants that serve poke with a similar niche."}
{"text":"I used to get acai bowls at my gym. Not anymore!!! This place was killer good. I pay the same price then at my gym and I het a way bigger portion here. The staff made it very quick and walked it right out to me. I very much enjoyed my time."}
{"text":"I think they have a great selection of smoothies and juices and they are pretty much all delicious but I'm not the biggest fan of their poke/acai bowls. Although this place does have vegan options and has all kinds of shots which is a plus."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE!!!  Kiana was a sweetheart. I bought 40 gift cards for our office staff and Kiana couldn't have been more helpful. She had to get extra cards from their other location and kept in contact with me by text using her personal cell phone letting me know when she had them.  She was polite and had a smile on her face every time I saw her.  The only thing I would suggest to the owner is to have stickers made for your gift cards.   I had my own stickers made for my gift cards which wasn't a big deal but it would have been less work had they been on them before I bought them.  Other than that for a new company they were great!!!!"}
{"text":"I had never had an açaí bowl before so in trying it for the first time, it was delish! I would definitely recommend the PB Lover... if you love peanut butter lol"}
{"text":"Popular with students from UNLV since it is very close to campus, so obviously catering to that population. This establishment serves \"healthy\" acai bowls, juices, and poke bowls.  Acari bowls here were nothing special. I have tried a few of the acai bowls, the Ocean and PB lover to name some, and nothing really stood out. The acai bowls were very watered down and bland. I also expected a lot more acai/pitaya. Most of my bowls were packed with granola. Not to mention that there is not much consistency and I finished my acai bowls very disappointed.  Service is lacking, as well. Employees did not seem like they wanted to be there at all and were quite rude to me and many customers I witnessed ordering. Very big turn off.  Will maybe come back to give this place another shot if I am in the area. Maybe I will try a poke bowl. Hopefully by then their customer service and food quality would have gone up."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a açaí bowl place close to my home. Sometimes you want a little treat but not overdo it. They don't just have the bowls, they have smoothies and ahi bowls as well. I decided to try the ocean açaí bowl and I instantly fell in love! You really can't go wrong with watermelon, strawberries and kiwi in the same bowl. For a regular size(which is gigantic ) is about 10.50. I think it's totally reasonable based on quality and size. They can get busy so you'll have to wait a bit but it's worth it! I will for sure be back to try more of the flavors.   Side note: they also carry kombucha, rose water and energy shots if you're trying to spice up your health life!"}
{"text":"Really stoked about this place. My first visit was about 2 weeks ago and I have been back twice since then. The Hula Bowl and OG Poke Bowl are amazing. Scarlett was the name of the girl whom helped me and made my Acai Bowl when I first went. Super friendly and provided super fast service. She even hooked me up with a loyalty card buy 10 bowls get an 11th regular bowl for free. Already half way there on my card punches haha."}
{"text":"The owner and people who work here are SO NICE and cool.  They make you feel welcome and at home and I appreciate that.  The acai bowls Ive had are great and I trust their ingredients mostly cause the owner seems very honest and real. In Vegas that is rare.  They are patient and answer questions about their food.  I like the way the place is decorated too."}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean and everyone is always happy and nice. I like coming to this place after a good hike."}
{"text":"I love the bowls here. The down side is the staff never answers the phone. I try calling in on my way to work and they never answer. I decided to drive by and go in before work and they should be open but no one is there. 3 stars only for the quality of food, your staff sucks"}
{"text":"Won't be back to this place. Don't get me wrong, it's a clean building, but when I ordered, I asked for no seeds in my food, then for my smoothie I asked for a large and received a small.   Here's the kicker, those small things I mentioned are small fixes, but food was not fresh, and the young guy who was working with the female, walks out of the rest room and never washed his hands. Then he begins working on food..... Dont need to believe me, but I know what I saw and my wife and friends, luckily for us the female worked on our bowls."}
{"text":"Great bowls! I was in Vegas for work, but was super sick. I got the bear bowl and a wellness juice. It was the perfect fix for my cold for the day."}
{"text":"I love bowlologies acai bowl mixtures and toppings but their sizes keep changing while their prices remain the same. Last time I ordered the smallest size it was doubles this.... need more consistency from this place."}
{"text":"Great acai bowls! Free wifi! Great seating for studying and chilling! Pretty lighting fixtures and decorations. This place is pretty low key, I'd prefer paying for a delicious nutritious fruit bowl than over priced coffee when I'm studying or catching up on work."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than others, I got my bowls to go just now and got home there is no sauce in the bowls.  How do you mess that up.     Update just got home a second time and yes a bowl with no sauce.  Might be because all I ever see is High school girls by themselves running the place instead of an adult manager but I'll stick to poke place across the lot"}
{"text":"These bowls are HUGE. How do they expect me to finish this?! The acai bowls here are extremely filling and the fruit are fresh. With it being so close to UNLV, the hours are closely related to student's schedules and don't really work with mine. They close really early (YEAH you read that right, 4PM) and are closed on weekends. The service is slow so hopefully there isn't a line!  The acai bowls are good, but everything else is slow and inconvenient."}
{"text":"REVISED JUNE 27, 2018 JOSH as promised you corrected an immediate concern which is why I'm adding changes to my previous review. SCARLETTE...please if you ever have an Team Member EOM, please nominate her. She's simply the finest  employee I've seen. When I brought my YELP review, she had already read it. She knew in advance about the PJ Lovers cup served in a child's container. She stated she reads all the reviews. She's brilliant, friendly, smiling, you name it. THANK YOU JOSH. Doug  First time great...ordered a PJ cup and my chef friend ordered a few different items. Man behind counter professional and efficient. Today, not so much.  I went and ordered the same but I requested a smaller cup because the standard cup is too much for me.  Same man....nice but said they don't serve in a smaller cup and that I'd have to order a kids ice cream only. One piece of advice...get rid of the word, 'no,' 'we can't,' and 'not allowed,' from your company. It kills business. Please tell me why I'd return if I can't  get what I want? You have all the product but a smaller version isn't allowed? Let me know when this is rectified and I'll return. I moved directly across the street. Thank you."}
{"text":"The brutal Vegas summer has finally arrived and as all try and seek shelter from it's heat, I find shelter here.  Interior: Nice and spacious with that korean coffee shop sort of decoration but not the best place to hangout in since the blenders are pretty busy.    Service: Everyone here was pretty nice but not so much the guy working there who seemed to only have love for the women and not for the fellas.   Food: I get the body builder which is pretty freaking awesome.  The frozen treat is nicely blended with no bits of ice or fruits while infusing a nice nuttiness from the peanut butter they add topped with fresh slices of bananas, crunchy (but not hard) granola pieces and honey.  Overall: This place is great as a summer time treat and as a healthy alternative.    *Rumor of a henderson location opening in the next 5 months per store worker"}
{"text":"A little pricey but most health food is, you get what you pay for. I've only had a few styles of their acai bowls, but they were great."}
{"text":"The concept of an eatery like this is great-- fast, fresh.....& fruity. Yes, it's all of the above, but it's also slightly overpriced for what you get. I bought a fresh-pressed juice, & it was over $7. When you think about it, it's close to what you'd pay for a drink at a concert. I saw the price on the menu. I know I didn't have to buy it. But I did need to see what could justify a price tag like that, in exchange for a plastic cup of juice. I even drove out of my way on my lunch break from work, just to see if I'd like their food. It was fresh, fast, fruity....and \"frothy.\" Being that the juice was frothy and wasn't chilled, it wasn't a refreshing beverage that quenched my thirst. Not worth $7. I didn't hate it, but I definitely wasn't blown away. It's so-so."}
{"text":"Very very very slow. I just got a fresh pressed juice and it was good. But not enough for the price. And did I mention very very slowwww  UDATE: I've edited my rating because the owner quickly responded and I appreciated an owner who cares that much about his business. I understand that I could've gone at an off-time and I'd be happy to go back and PAY for another drink. I do appreciate the offer from the owner though. Thank you"}
{"text":"They say Las Vegas is not hipster. Apparently whoever \"they\" are never visited here.   I discovered bowlology back in early July when I started working in Northwest Vegas. I was working in the 110 degree heat 12 hours a day, seven days a week to elect Hillary Clinton. Naturally, that meant I had little time to chat with my coworkers. So one of them said, \"Alec, let's get lunch.\" I was excited but then I felt worried that she could not find a place to eat because she was vegan.   I was wrong.   She introduced me to bowlology. I am an Italian food person, a Chinese food person, a sushi person, a beer person, a pizza person, a steak person and a fruit person but I never saw myself as a fruit bowl person.   Then I had the hula bowl at bowlology. Then I realized again that I was wrong   Also, the staff member recognized me the 2nd time I came here. That is a large plus, a very big plus. Then I came back, then I came back again, and I stopped by here at 15-20 times (maybe even more). The staff kept recognizing me, I kept enjoying my hula, I enjoyed how healthy it was compared to other options in the area. The wait was short, the chairs were comfy, the air was cool, the wall with the drawings on it was beautiful. I like everything about bowlology and I love how it brought some hipster air straight into Northwest Vegas. Thank you bowlology, I miss the hula bowl!"}
{"text":"Good place and good acai...the male cashier ( blond) with a college ring could use people skill..smile please..your store is busy..show some enthusiasm. ."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place and was very disappointed. I got the signature bowl Spicy Shoyu with a leafy green base. The lettuce was rotten an gross."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a couple of days ago to give it a try since it's close to the campus. I ordered the Berry Good Bowl with the Acai but it tasted very bland and the cashier didn't seem friendly at all. The strawberries and blueberries didn't seem fresh at all and granola was also very little. I usually get my Acai bowls at Juice N Go and I have to say I rather pay a bit more and get something worth my money than this."}
{"text":"Paradise Smoothie was delicious!!! Like the small kick of ginger in it as well! Great place, although pretty quiet maybe they can play some tunes in the background."}
{"text":"I loved the pink dragon smoothie, it is an a aquired taste however. they have a nice variety of yummy healthy smoothies and smoothie bowls. Quick and prompt service."}
{"text":"If you want to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable this is the place to go. All the workers seemed like they were bothered to be there let alone put together an acai bowl. The actual acai bowl was good but overpriced. The floor was covered in crumbs and who knows what else. I'd be scared to see what the kitchen looked like.   Won't be back. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot for açaí bowls. The wait was a little long, but it take a few minutes to make a bowl, right? They have some different toppings and combos that I haven't seen before, some leaning towards dessert (chocolate chips, peanut butter) but I got a standard bowl with granola, strawberries, bananas and honey. The granola inside was awesome."}
{"text":"The food is good. Fresh fruits and all kinda pricey though. I always see my cousin posts instagram pictures of being here and he always made me want to try it so now here I am. And I kinda like it. It's cute"}
{"text":"I had my first visit two days ago. Laura was very helpful in recommending the Ocean Bowl! After the gym, this was the perfect snack- filling, fresh, and generous with the toppings. The environment was super cozy, as well!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star rating if it weren't for the night staff. The morning staff is amazing. They are super friendly, quick and my bowls always taste great. I love stopping here in the morning on my way to work. As for the night staff, they are ridiculously slow and definitely not as friendly. I once went in and waited 20 minutes, the kicker being that I was the only person in there. All I ordered was 2 bowls. And they still managed to get my order wrong. With the morning staff, there can be a long line and I never have to wait more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"UPDATE: as of my last visit in Sept sometime I noticed some new and different staff members that were very kind ! The young blond haired girl even helped me decide what I wanted based on our conversation and she hit the mark, my bowl was delicious. I got 2 thank you this day and I was very pleased"}
{"text":"Love this place & all of their options for their bowls. Plus it's right across the street from UNLV, so it's a healthy alternative for a college student diet. I got the chocolate lover with açaí. Amazing."}
{"text":"After hiking Red Spring & the Calico Basin in 90 degree heat, nothing tastes better than a cool, fresh açai bowl. Açai to a T is only 8 minutes from Red Rock Canyon (just across from the resort) so it makes for the perfect post-hike indulgence.   The space is clean & minimalistic with a cute organic style. The menu--including juices, smoothies, açai & pitaya bowls--has lots of delicious options and combos, so making a decision was tough! Side note - the menu's oddly placed in the back corner away from the register, so in addition to having a hard time choosing between yummy options, it's literally difficult to order because of this odd setup. Why not put the menu on the wall behind the cashier?? There's even room for it!  Either way, I went with the regular sized Berry Good açai bowl, $6.99. My order took about 5-10 minutes since they blend everything fresh - luv that. The açai blend had excellent texture but lacked tartness, perhaps too much banana in the mix. They really load up the toppings though! The diced fruit and granola were so fresh and juicy - overall an excellent bowl."}
{"text":"Great location!! I was really impressed the the variety of Açai and protein bowls. Menu was clear and easy to see every ingredient and add on's. I loved the fresh pressed juice names and different healthy options. It was an overall positive expensive and great customer service. Visually the place looks clean and there a beautiful wall of positive quotes and chalk drawings. I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably the best place I've found here in Vegas for acai bowls. I've tried other places and it's not as fresh as Bowlology. I like the fact that they have so many different options to choose from in terms of acai/pitaya bowls. My personal favorite is the Ocean because it's topped with watermelon, kiwi, and strawberries. I haven't encountered many acai bowl places that incorporate watermelon so when I saw that as a topper, I was excited.   I've tried their sushi bowls as well. I've had better but theirs will do if you're craving or if an acai bowl doesn't fill you up. They don't have as many options to choose from and if I remember correctly, there's only 3 variations you can pick from.   They also have a nice selection of smoothies and juices you can pick from. All of which are tasty and fresh! They even do juice cleanses/detoxes for $40 I believe which isn't bad in comparison to other places. They come in really cute mason jars that you can reuse for overnight oats or other things."}
{"text":"Not that great. The bowl ingredients weren't that fresh and I ordered pickled veggies (an extra) and they were invisible.  My smoothie was thin and tasted artificial...maybe cause of the vanilla almond milk? I couldn't really detect a lot of fruits n veggies in it. Mostly just sweet.   The store was clean and the staff was nice. Due to the food I prob won't be back though."}
{"text":"Oh my God I absolutely love this place and the girls that work here are fantastic! I am absolutely hooked we are definitely going to be regulars!"}
{"text":"My first time trying, and I really wanted to love it, but I wasn't exactly bowled (ha ha ha) over. I went in on a cold Saturday morning in December. There was only one other customer in there, and she had already ordered. I walked through n went to the counter and stood there for a good few minutes before being greeted. Ugh, so annoying, I can't stand not being greeted upon entering an establishment. The guy took my order and I sat down and waited. I ordered a large ( freaking huge) chocolate lovers bowl, I think that's what it was called. I only waited a few minutes and he brought my order out to me. The large is huuuuuuge! Definitely sharing size. Next time I will get a regular. I dove in, and that's where I started liking this place just a little less. Everything tasted frozen. Not to mention it was freezing already inside and outside, so the last thing I wanted was to bite into frozen strawberries. Zero chocolate flavor. Halfway through, I couldn't taste any of the honey flavoring. Then at the bottom just loaded with granola. I would have enjoyed it more if A: there was more chocolate flavor B: the granola was mixed in instead of at the bottom and C: it did not taste FROZEN. I might try again, but definitely in the summer when I might not mind the coldness so much."}
{"text":"It is VERY hard to beat Juice N Go...and unfortunately this place does not either. I got the energizer juice and it was super good! No soapy after taste at all. Place is very clean and comfy. I also had a customized pitaya bowl and although the size was HUGE it just was average. Did not taste super fresh. There are strictly teenagers working there and although they were nice, don't expect stellar service. The prices to are a little high, and if I am going to pay that much I'm going to Juice N Go. I would definitely not purposely drive here for their juices or bowls, but if I was in the area for my Costco trips than yes I would stop in."}
{"text":"Yes! Delicious poke bowl, impressive bodybuilder bowl, cool decor, super friendly staff and a low wait time? This is my new favorite place. I am excited to try their juices, but will need to eat several dozen more poke bowls before I am ready to try other things. The menu is easy to follow and the guy working the front couldn't have been nicer or more helpful."}
{"text":"Staff is the best!! Body Builder Pitya almond milk whey protein x2 blue berries instead of strawberries no granola no honey!! Super high maintenance order but alway get it right! Love this place! New name but still same great staff. New menu but you can still get all the classic bowls if you ask."}
{"text":"My first statement is that this is better than ice cream. I know that's a strong statement but my when I took my first bite of my rise and shine acai bowl, I was in heaven. This is exactly what I needed to cool off for summer. It's not overly sweet and creamy like ice cream and gelato, but has a refreshing and healthy taste. Not the bad kind of healthy taste but the good one. The taste that makes you want to eat healthy for every meal.   At first I thought the price was a little high, but now I am more than happy to pay the price. It's a much healthier alternative to ice cream. I could honestly eat this for every meal of summer. Also, it is GMO free!  The rise and shine acai bowl with vitamin C is $8.52. The only thing that wasn't what I like was the mango because it was in chunks near the core. But I can just order it without the mango.   100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sea Breeze, it was exactly what I was craving. Customer service was good. Quality is excellent. Definitely found my a new fav!"}
{"text":"This is only my second time here and both times I asked for no honey and no bee pollen. Guess what my açaí bowl had both times? Honey and bee pollen.  Sure it may not be a big deal but what happens if I was deathly allergic to any of these ingredients and had no idea they have been included in my food after I've already taken a bite once I've asked for them to not be included? Not a big deal?  Anyways. Will not be coming back. Do not like how they do not listen."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Bowlology opened nearby.  I received a mailer, the menu looked great and I went to check it out a couple of days ago.  it was around 3:00 in the afternoon and the staff was super friendly and gave me excellent service.  They had just been slammed during lunch hour and still offered service with a smile and enthusiasm. I love meeting a staff that takes pride in their service and their products and these guys definitely did.   I tried the spicy tuna bowl, it was delicious. I also had the Acai PB Lover bowl.  It was so amazing I am dreaming of another one.  When I came home, I froze half of it to save for later.  I ate it the next day and it was still just as delicious. I plan to go back tomorrow and have another one :)"}
{"text":"I was super disappointed. First off, my cousin and I love getting acai bowls. We crave it ALL the time. I ordered the Berry Good bowl from the Hualapai location before and loved it. So i convinced my cousin that she had to try Bowlology. We have tried multiple establishments that sell Acai bowls and i told her that I really liked Bowlology's the best. So today I was finally able to convince her to try it out. This was the first time I had tried this location and was expecting it to be exactly the same. To my dismay, it definitely wasn't.  Right from the moment we walked in, it was not a great vibe. The cashier was not welcoming at all. She didn't even say \"hello\" or \"can i take your order\". Nothing. No words at all. I awkwardly approached the counter and just started to order, assuming that she was ready because she had not said a word. So i ordered the Berry Bowl. Exactly like i did at the other location. Berry Bowl with Acai, and my cousin ordered the Makai. Right when we got it, i already noticed that mine was different. It was more of a pink color than the bowl that i got before. I also know that Acai bowls are much darker than Pitya, so im assuming they made it with Pitya. The consistency of the blend was very weird. I think the amount of bananas that was mixed into it may have caused it? I'm not sure but it was like a weird thick mucus like consistency which i feel would only be from the bananas. Was not a fan. Super sad that it was not what I was expecting at all. The toppings also weren't as fresh as expected. I got a good amount of mush blueberries. No bueno. AND on top of that, now my cousin doesn't believe me and is not a fan on Bowlology. She was not a fan of her bowl either. The taste didn't do it for her. Hers also wasn't as blended as I've seen others in the past. I'm hoping that it was just this location that was the problem and will hopefully try to convince my cousin to give the other location a shot.   But as of right now, it looks like i'll be taking a break from Bowlology and just stick to Nekter, as they are very consistent with their bowls."}
{"text":"I went in 3 days ago & tried a smoothy (the superman) it was pretty good.  Then today I had a bowl, I made a custom one. WOW, it was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the OC Ahi tuna bowl- around $11- pretty straight forward with tuna, brown or white rice, Hawaiian salt, seaweed salad and a thick sauce thats soy sauce based. Also ordered the green juice- they offer two sizes- wasn't overly 'green' tasting but also not too sweet. They also had a few salad bowl options and several smoothie and acai options. You order at the desk- not a sit down restaurant, but they have tables you can eat at if you choose to stay."}
{"text":"Ordered the OG poke bowl- it was amazing! Seaweed salad on top of brown rice and poke mixed with a soy dressing. Also got the Watermelon cold pressed juice, which was delicious!!! Also tried the wheatgrass and greens shot- it was amazing! Best health shot I've had. The acai bowls looked really good and big too! $11 for the poke bowl and $8 for juice."}
{"text":"There are a few locations in Vegas, but I'd never gone despite hearing nothing but good things from other people. I'm tired of the food options on campus, so I walked across the street right before closing to grab an OG Poke bowl for dinner after class. I'd tried it before when a classmate of mine got it, but I'm glad I got an entire one for myself! It is a little expensive, but there is a good value and the quality of the food is excellent. The bowl filled me up and was a great alternative for dinner. I will definitely return to try an acai bowl next!"}
{"text":"We came in and were quickly greeted. The customer service was fabulous. The menu is amazing, the fruit is fresh. We got their Bear Bowl and it was awesome. The atmosphere is very clean and trendy. Ample parking, and right off the freeway."}
{"text":"Came here because juice n go was closed :( but since it's my first time.. & I totally looked clueless.. I wasn't even asked if I needed help. So I had to figure out what I wanted on my own.. with a help of a few reviews and yelp pictures.    Upon paying, the guy up front looked sleepy, which is understandable.. but when I handed him my credit card.. he kinda rolled his eyes (totally not welcoming) & giving back the card to me.. he threw the card at me rather than handing it to me. (Cashier was wearing: grey shirt, white beanie, & glasses) This was a far drive! & it's definitely not worth it. I would much rather wait for juice n go to open.   Prices are average but I can get it somewhere else. Service was horrible and food was mediocre.  Skip on this place & go to a different acai place instead. That's unless you're dressed like you're a billionaire then they'll definitely treat you better"}
{"text":"Came here today after hiking for hours and it certainly hit the spot.   I ordered a Berry Good Acai bowl. The fruit toppings were fresh. The granola was my favorite part (aside from the actual Acai blend). My bf got the pitaya feel good. I tried some and I'm thinking of getting one when I come back.   I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I waited a good while to get my bowl. People who ordered after me were getting their orders first and I got quite confused."}
{"text":"I'm angry that I wasted my money lol. Got greeted when I came in, kinda. The girl was soft spoken. It was dead in there.   I stood there for a little, looking at the menu, and she just stood there looking at me. Lol. I felt so awkward. Anyways, I felt so awkward standing there so I just asked her if they had a plain acai bowl. She told me about the makai bowl, so I decided to go with that. She explained that it was a couple scoops of acai. Got my acai bowl not even 5 minutes later and was so impressed because it came so fast but also thought it was weird... I didn't even hear any blender go off.   So I tried this acai bowl and goodness. I wanted to just throw it away. When she said scoops of acai, I didn't think she meant they just plopped frozen shiz in a cup and put a couple of toppings in there. I do appreciate the unfrozen fruits. I also appreciate that she asked me if I was a student & got a discount. What irks me about that tho is that their bowls are fricken expensive. $7 something (with discount, so technically more) for a not so great acai bowl. I was so hungry so I just ate all the toppings & threw the rest away. I really wanted to like this place cos i loveeee acai bowls. It just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"I have been neutral about this place and have tried to keep an open mind, but after many tries I am leaving a 1 star. First, it is a matter of luck as to how your smoothies and bowls will taste and look. I'm batting 50%. Twice my Acai bowls have been delicious, creamy and most importantly tasted like Acai..3 other times not even Acai colors. Please provide your staff with written recipes to improve consistency. It's devastating to have the best and the worst bowls just days apart. Updated to 3 stars because I may have been too hungry when I wrote it. I refused to eat my Acai bowl and was Hangry!"}
{"text":"Love the place. love the açaí & pittaya bowls..not sure about the poke bowls they offer. Came in 04/21/2018  We had ordered rise and shine bowl and a spicy shoyu poke bowl with sushi rice.   The rise and shine bowl was delicious !!!!!!!!! It had strawberries, banana, and granola! It all tastes so good, its very proportionate. Every bite, you get a bit of everything !   The poke bowl, was not as great. The edamame should have been cooked a bit longer, and maybe the rice too. The rice was hard, it wasn't traditional sushi rice. It wasn't really spicy either. The tuna poke was okay. I wouldn't get this item again though, I'll probably just stick to the açaí & pittaya bowls.   The store is clean, the workers were alright. I told the lady it was our first time there. She just asked if we needed time, and I just said yes, so she ran off to make orders. She looked like she was ready to walk off. It's okay, It wasn't too hard to look and read what goes into these items."}
{"text":"Finally an quality acai spot! Just bummed it's not closer to me in mountains edge. I had the Rise and Shine and it was so delicious! My husband had Berry Good and he said it was berry good! There's so much I want to try and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh friendly healthy spot with alkaline water and delicious super bowls. I had the very Tasty Ocean bowl with the Spicy Shoyu like bowl. I lived it and while I'm on my vegetarian pescatarian journey thus spot is a must for me."}
{"text":"I finally was on this side of town so I stopped in to try it!! It was soooo yummy!! I got the sea breeze, I would definitely recommend it.. The whole little place was all good vibes & the staff were so helpful and answered all of my questions so nicely (: For sure going back to try their poke bowls! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the best acai and pitaya bowls in town. Their servings are very generous compared to most places and they have great service. Try this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of favorite açaí bowls I've tried others but this one is far the best one I always ask for extra granola. If you're in the mood for açaí go here you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my pitaya bowl with yummy berries, honey and granola. There are absolutely no complaints about my food, its was delish!!! However, the customer service was so,so.  Seemed as if one of the girls working there wasn't having the best day, even though there was no one in the store except for her and 2 other male workers. The gentleman who rung me up was nice and patient since it was my first time."}
{"text":"While their bowls are yummy, I give it a 4 due to pricing, WAY too much and time, We always wait SO long."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in forever, so when I finally went back I noticed that they had some renovations and they changed their menu up a little.   The renovations including more places to sit and the way the ordering and pick up was done.  They also had a little small open faced up fridge with juices and other items in it for purchase. Overall,it was still the cute acai to the t that I know and love.   Changes to the menu: now you can pick in your acai bowl whether or not you want acai or pitaya. I rather like that option because I am personally partial to pitaya, and now I can try different mixtures and such.   I still ordered the same ocean cup which was very enjoyable and I still love the consistency that this place has with there smoothies and the bottom of the acai bowls. I will say that I am more of a fan of the bowls then of the smoothies.   I hope to one day try the juices and he juice cleanse but I just really love the bowls from here. Plus, other bowl places tend to not blend the bottom well and it's a disappointment. So I'm always really happy with how things are made here and the ordering process is super easy."}
{"text":"I know that açaí/pitaya or any sort of fruit bowl is expensive, not going to lie, but Bowlology seems to be pretty reasonable than other places! Depending on what you get obviously the price will vary, but definitely worth it! It's also across the street from UNLV, which makes it convenient.  I love açaí, but I have been loving pitaya a little more. I love getting the Berry Good because there's all of my favorite fruits on top! Strawberries, bananas, and blueberries, granola, and honey. Simple. It's my favorite! It's around $9, but if you're a UNLV student, you'll get a student discount! So really, around $8. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Great 1st visit.  Tastes similar to other location!  Only issue was juicer machine down!  No beet juice to go?!"}
{"text":"Really good Acai bowls, but I'm only giving this three stars because the customer service could be better. The girl that's always on the register never greets and she's always saying \"what do you want?\" Need better customer service training."}
{"text":"This place used to be called Bowl of Heaven, but is now called Bowlology, & they are offering food, drinks and more! I absolutely adore this place, and the staff is always so friendly. It's right across UNLV, so it's very convenient for college students. Ashley helped me pick a bowl that fit my wants and needs with the fruits and toppings. They are a little pricey, but I think it is definitely worth it since they use all organic ingredients. I got the ocean bowl with a?ai, and it was sooo yummy :) I can't wait to try their food and smoothies next time!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and wont give them business anymore. Poorly managed. High school kids probably being paid minimum wage. Today was my last time there. I ordered over the phone asked for a salmon bowl. The upstream. Asked if I could get a little rice and greens or whatever the options were to just put a little green in there with a little rice. They charged me an additional 3 dollars for nothing more. I asked for extra protein. The girl said whey or soy? Im like what? No, more protein as in salmon. They were literally going to put whey powder on my salmon. lol. I get there the total was $18 Im like what? Well 5 dollars extra for cabbage and mixed greens and seawees same portion. Kids had no clue what they were doing or werent taught how to keep customers happy that are paying their bills. Not asking for a lot here just common sense. Im like Im not paying that. The kid goes Oh sorry well have a nice day then I guess. lol. And Im someone who always tips a dollar or two. Its not about the money its about the experience and how you treat paying customers that arent asking for a whole lot besides common sense. My advice drive an extra 5 min and give someone else your business. Most of the positive reviews are from when it was Acai to the T fyi. Not bowlology."}
{"text":"This place is very relaxing and bowls are amazing. A very good treat especially with this summer heat. I recommend the Very Berry and the Ocean. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Waited here for 20 minutes for 3 pittaya bowls. Ended up getting 3 açaí bowls. Told the girl at the register and all she said was \"sorry\" didn't offer to do anything or make new ones. I didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes and paying for new bowls but come on. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"So this place has good açaí bowls, but I don't think they are worth the price. Also, where is the nutritional information? The poke bowls are definitely over priced.  It is a small amount of fish, not enough sauce, and they nickel and dime you for every additional topping, when you can go to many other poke places and pay a flat fee and have endless options to put on your bowls. The jalapeños added to the poke bowl were chopped into large chunks bigger than the fish. Why would I want to bite into a giant piece of jalapeño and ruin the flavor of the bowl that way. I can't say anything tasted bad, but I don't think it was worth it to go back."}
{"text":"I'm an açaí lover! Originally from Hawaii so I know what good açaí bowl taste like. I was very disappointed about their açaí bowls here as they are previously frozen sorbet and scooped like icecream. Real açaí should be made to order and should not have a thick consistency. The flavor wasn't that great as well and had almost no taste to it. The 2 stars are for the workers, who were very friendly and the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"I love this place, great customer service! This is definitely my go-to place and I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and fam!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and both purchases have been great. The 1st time was for one of their juices and this time was for lunch. I had the Green Machine and wasn't quite sure what to expect but it was delicious. It's also a great alternative to ice cream or frozen yogurt and way healthier. They have a fantastic selection of gluten-free vegan options as well so if you're picky like me, this place is perfect. They're bowls are gluten-free vegan and their snacks are as well! Dbl bonus.   Also if you order your bowls without granola, they offer substitutes."}
{"text":"We got 2 spicy shoyu and a I love acai smoothie. Very clean and nice decor. Nice staff. Bowls were fresh but had a little too much sauce, making it taste salty-order it on the side.   Would go again."}
{"text":"I had the ocean bowl. It was sweet but I like sweet, so I loved it. All of the fruit on top was fresh which made everything blend wonderfully. I enjoyed every bite. Will come back again soon especially since I get a discount with my kickboxing membership. Healthier option than the Yogurtland next door."}
{"text":"Ten times better than juice n go hands down, so happy they have this location in vegas!!!! Rise & shine was very delicious, very fruity!"}
{"text":"The acai bowls are good, but I wouldn't recommend the poke bowls. The brown rice was hard; undercooked. I got the spicy shoyu. Not spicy at all; not even a little kick. As for the fish to rice ratio, it's not worth $10.99. If you want a good poke bowl, go to Poke Express at Island Sushi and Grill.   As for the service, the cashier wasn't friendly. She needs to smile. I thought she would smile after a tip, but not even a \"thank you.\" The other cashier sort of made up for it. Still a bit disappointed :/"}
{"text":"Came here after a morning hike with my girlfriends. This Bowlology is located in a very large plaza and the interior gives off a very beachy vibe. I got the Hula Pitaya Bowl which costed me around ~$9. The regular size is fairly large and was more than enough for me to eat. My bowl was topped with fresh fruits and crunchy granola! It was a perfect sweet treat to cool off from the hot weather!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw a sign that said they were \"now open.\" Walked in expecting to find a small cafe type place to being in a cold empty space. They had some cool chalk art that covers one wall, but not much furniture. I could probably drive a couple motorcycles in here and park them next to a table. Well, I only ordered a juice cause i was thirsty. I ordered a large energizer juice. When ordering the attendant asked me large or small and pointed to the two plastic cup sizes near the register.  I opted for the large. i waited about 5-7 minutes and was handed a mason jar of juice with a lid. I asked the person if this was the same amount of juice as a large as it appeared much smaller. He advised it was the same. He said that if I brought back the mason jar for a refill i get 10% off my next drink. Now Im sure some people would appreciate the mason jar as it is cute. But for me, it was not practical and not really what I had ordered. So try to put a mason jar in your car holder for drinks. Yea that wasn't happening. And also, I wanted a straw so then had to take the top off and deal with trying not to spill it. UGH. So, overall, I was just really unhappy with the whole situation. The juice was ok, not the best I have had. It would have been nice if they would have asked me if i wanted it iced or not."}
{"text":"Wanted a healthy, filling breakfast and found it in the picturesque Red Rock shopping area. Great menu, great service and great food."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Bowlology since I love acai bowls.   They offer so many options of pitiya (dragon fruit) or acai bowls with various toppings.  After much deliberation I went with the hula bowl and shared the regular size with a friend.  If you are eating this as a meal, a regular is big enough but as we were eating this for dessert, sharing between 2 people was plenty enough.    The hula is topped with coconut, honey, granola, bananas and strawberries.  The bowl was very refreshing!  The granola added much needed crunch and texture and the acai itself wasn't overly sweet.   The hula base is blended with tropical fruits like pineapples and mango (i think), I can definitely taste it.    Will definitely come back here to try all their bowls!   Their store is very spacious with lots of tables and outlets so you can come study here as well!"}
{"text":"Go to Nektar across the street.  You won't have to wait forever while watching the people who are supposed to be working goof off.  I am all for fun and games, but maybe make our order first.  We go to juice bars a lot.  Figured we would try a new one out.  On average I would say we wait 3 minutes for juice(2 of them) to be made once ordered, 5 minutes at most - and that is when it is busy.  In most juice bars there is 2, maybe 3 employees working.  Here, they had 4 and with no line it took somewhere between 10-15 minutes to get our juice.  During that time we got to watch one employee throw something that appeared to be food at another employee, one employee playing on a cell phone, and another dancing around with a garbage bag on her head.  All of which would honestly probably be okay if someone had just made our order in a somewhat timely manner.  When we did receive our juice, both were in mason jars.  Mine was sticky and hers was dripping beet juice from the bottom( a lot of it) which she luckily didn't get on her clothes(Ultimately what brought this down to one star).  We didn't exactly wait for perfection when it came to the juice.  Her Acai bowl came out quickly and she enjoyed it, but that was easily overshadowed by everything else.    Nektar juice bar is 3 minutes from here, and The Juice Standard is 8 minutes from here.  With competitors that close that deliver the same product as good or better in a fraction of the time in containers that are easy to drink out of that aren't sticky or dripping, then why would we return here?  It sounds harsh, and it is harsh, but it is the reality of the situation.    I would suggest looking into those competitors and what they are doing differently."}
{"text":"Three stars and I'm being generous. There is only frozen fruit, they put honey on the bowl and didn't disclose it after I told them that I was vegan. They use pre-made cheap apple juice in most of their smoothies and they also advertise that they make fresh squeezed juice but turns out that they don't even have a machine nor fresh fruit to juice there."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Customer service is terrible. Most act like they want to be somewhere else. Stop hiring high school kids. This specially goes to the girl that was working Christmas Eve around 230pm. Noticed all the chairs were up so I thought they were closed but there was a sign on the door that said they're open till 3. So walked in and the moment she saw me she rolled her eyes at me. Very rude. So just left. Never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome place. To ease your experience, look up what you want to order and call it in because this place will be busier than you think."}
{"text":"I love this place but not this location the ladies are rude and they gave me all butt end of strawberries as if they are sweet, it's so bitter  in my Berry Sweet bowl."}
{"text":"Oh wow!   So freaking good!  This was my first experience with an acai bowl and i gotta say im already hooked!  Tastes like dessert... hard to believe its healthy, lol  It was slow when i went in today so i think i lucked out because the staff was super friendly and i got my order really fast.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4 - cute, clean and spacious. It seems more like a cafe than anything! It's relaxing and the decor makes it easy for people to get caught up in conversation here.   They apparently changed where you order, so the menu is in an odd placement at the back, then you go 10 steps towards the front to order.   Service: 3 - a little slow for there being no one else there but my friend and I. I didn't mind waiting that day, but if it was a day that I would have been in a hurry, I'm not sure I would have been okay with the wait time.   Food: 3 - I got the Feel Good pitaya bowl, which is dragonfruit. I guess that it all depends on what fruits you like, but I'm not a fan of really sweet things and pitaya is a bit sweeter than acai.   So I still prefer acai.   But even then, the bowl was still too sweet for my liking. There was way too much honey and too much juice blended with pitaya.   Still, this place is not bad, it's just a little too sweet! But people that have super sweet teeth would like it a lot more!!"}
{"text":"This place is good! For all those that complain about the food, I think they're just too picky. I definitely recommend the Upstream with extra salmon, it's delicious. For drinks so far my favorite is the Mango Madness! I also really like the Hula bowl! This place is near UNLV and is pretty convenient for when I get off class! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Amazing. They have a large selection of bowls and toppings as well as sizes. Their bowls are delicious and the employees were extremely friendly. I enjoyed looking over their juices that they also have available in a fridge along with different protein bars. There is a large parking lot out front and they offer cold water and cups."}
{"text":"Holy acai on toast, there's finally a shop on this side of town.  A small, new establishment that's hiding right next to a giant Yogurtland place, this little hole in the wall kicks ass.  While it may be on the pricey side, the smoothies are delicious and the bowls are a pretty good size portion. They have a menu where you can select premade bowls, smoothies, or juices, but there is also a customization option where you can build yours with whatever you want. Along with acai, they have various assorted fruits, yogurt, oats and honey that you can mix into your healthy snack. Super happy this place is here, hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Not for me. Jumbo juice so much better.ordered carrot juice and it came watery.jumbo juice I'm coming back"}
{"text":"I'm visiting here from Toronto and healthy bowl shops are just starting to become popular over there. Came for lunch and ordered the upstream poke bowl with the salmon. They had salmon, but it wasnt fully defrosted yet because of a busy morning. I didn't mind because I was taking it to go, it would thaw out by the time I eat it anyways, but the owner of the store was so nice and apologetic about the inconvenience that he gave me a complimentary hula bowl card, and told me if I don't like he poke bowl, to come back later and they'll make me another one on the house.  When he saw that I was looking at the cold pressed juices that they had, he said take one, it's on the house.   Toronto needs service like this. I'd come back just because of it."}
{"text":"There bowls are amazing. I love the rise and shine bowl. Its yummy and keeps me full for a while. Tastes great and healthy!"}
{"text":"I came in to pick up bowls before work and they were absolutely delicious! I got the Rise and Shine bowl (with Pitaya) and it was not only pretty to look at, but tasted amazing. I also ordered the PB Lover bowl for my friend, which I was skeptical about how to flavors would fit with each other, but they totally did...I think I'll be ordering this one next time! The fruit was fresh, bowls tasted great, and it was a full house of happy customers."}
{"text":"This place is cool.   This place is expensive.   This place has some good smoothies.    The Garden of Greens is great with whey protein. It was super tasty. But for $8 whatever? That's a lot compared to the competition.   It was pretty dead up in there. I never see it busy when I do my drive by. Maybe because of the prices. Or maybe people don't know much about it yet. I'm cool with the mom and pop places. It just sucks when you pay $20 for two smoothies. And it's not a large amount.   Either way, I dig it. I'll go back on occasion for splurging purposes."}
{"text":"This place is new, clean, and fresh! You have to try the hula acai bowl and the paradise juice with vegan protein!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, a few times when this place first opened and for the first time in a few month,s today. A few things have changed since then. The decor is nice, very subtle and quirky.  I'm a sucker for pitaya bowls. I always choose them over acai bowls. The quality of the pitaya/acai bases are great: smooth and thick. Although, the toppings on the bowls have been cut down compared to when they first opened. You get a large portion of pitaya/acai and granola, but not enough fruits on top.  My biggest issue was my most recent visit. I ordered a Feel Good. My fourth scoop in, I found a long blonde hair hanging off the spoon.  No matter what, the food industry will always come across mistakes here and there. The largest role about these situations is how you handle it, and intriguing your customer to return. I immediately returned the bowl to the workers and they did not hesitate to remake a new one for me. When I received the new one, on top was the old spoon I previously used where I discovered that piece of hair in my bowl.  Overall, I wouldn't come back to this place. It was an option to go to because it was a Sunday, Juice N Go was closed. The menu is also limited compared to Juice N Go, where you can completely customize what you want for your bowl. I'm glad acai bowls and juice bars are expanding here in Vegas, but I think I'll just stick to Juice N Go."}
{"text":"I'm an açaí bowl fanatic and I've been to many places, so I wanted to give this one a try. However, I wasn't impressed. I ordered the one at the bottom. I think it's called a bear bowl. The actually açaí smoothie part of it tastes like pepto bismol. I'm not trying to be rude it's just that that's what the taste reminded me of. The toppings were okay. Chocolate chips and peanut butter were crunchy like the granola. Nothing to rave about. The only thing that saved it for me was that the fruit was fresh and honey was good."}
{"text":"More than one occasion my acai bowl tasted like FISH! I love the place but they need to be more careful preparing acai bowls and Ahi tuna in the same kitchen! Lazy or don't care."}
{"text":"This is a great product - I have eaten the Rise & Shine several times. My concern is the lack of consistency in service and product. The Rise & Shine is my favorite and there still are little inconsistencies in how it is served. I hope that they can figure it out. There is rarely the same employees on each visit, and high turn over  is a concern."}
{"text":"Best new place in Summerlin!!  My kids are picky eaters and both loved it.  My daughter asked if we could go after school sometimes!  Very healthy and tasty!  We will go back often."}
{"text":"Omg, the best açaí Bowl I've ever tasted! I love how it wasn't too sweet and very well balanced. My friend got the green paradise smoothie, it was potent and rich in flavor. The service was very quick and the employees were knowledgeable on the products. It has a cute interior inside, it is definitely going to be a go to spot."}
{"text":"Just to start off I want to say that the girls that work at this shop are not only extremely cute but they are great at helping you choose the right bowl for you. It's a clean good vibe place that you can enjoy a great healthy treat and hang out with friends. The acai taste awesome every time. They are very consistent with how well the bowls and smoothies are made. I'd recommend this to anyone that like froyo or smoothies already. And best of all, you leave a happier person!:)"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Very clean. The staff is always friendly. Best Acai place on the west side."}
{"text":"Update: THEY DO HAVE A STAMP CARD/REWARD SYSTEM It was really nice because the business owner personally reached out to me to let me know they did. I've tried and loved other bowls so I decided to try decided to try their Bear Bowl this time. The whey was the only thing I could taste but every bowl is different! I'll probably just stick to my regular hula or ocean bowl next time. Great service and great presentation as always Thank you Loved the açaí bowl. It's 12 for a large 32 oz and it is definitely worth. My husband ordered because I've been sick and stayed in the car. The HULA BOWL was not only packed but such a beautiful work of art. The bowl was huge and easily fed my husband myself and our daughter. Really if you're looking for the best flavor and the most bang for your buck this place is it. I loved that the açaí was so thick because with other places it's thin and smoothie like/ easier to eat with a straw. Skip Jamba Juice and try this place there portions are gigantor and everything was fresh. Wasn't busy at all around 4pm on 1/8/2018. Thank you to the girl working for an amazing bowl on this rainy day! Only tip for management please make a stamp card program!"}
{"text":"Great food , fresh and tasty, loved the selection and system for ordering, the prices were reasonable and the staff was first rate. Great location with plenty of parking. Will return next time we want poke."}
{"text":"This is one of my worst experiences because of customer service. I find myself sitting and waiting for a bowl that usually takes five to ten minutes wait over 30 minutes. I inquired with one of the employees about the long wait times and he said \"I just got here\" and gave me a cold shoulder. There is an ample amount of room for more employees to work or at least a notification of busy times. I felt under appreciated as a customer and I would not come back to this specific location again."}
{"text":"I love acai bowls so I try to go to all the acai bowl spots in Vegas. The bowl was great but like many of the reviews state, the service! I just felt unwelcomed, not very friendly staff, and goofing off like many previous reviews state. I don't know, it's not like they were rude but they just don't seem pleasant. No one greets you when you walk in or even says goodbye. The vibe just seemed off. Working in customer service made me realize how much interacting with customers does make a difference with the overall experience. The bowl was delicious but the customer service made me knock a star off. Will come back if I'm ever on the Summerlin side craving an acai or to try one of the pitaya bowls!"}
{"text":"I find myself driving by this place a little too often and I always tell myself that I should stop on by one of these days. Well that day was today, I stopped by with my Great Dane whom is a licensed service dog and it was far from pleasant. Not only does the place lack personality and it could use some more furniture, but truthfully I can't even comprehend why anyone would want to stay and eat there since the customer service is beyond dissapointing.  As I was asking the lady at the cashier some questions she had some slight attitude and after I ordered and paid for a Hula Acai bowl she said, \"due to the health department regulations you can't have your dog in here so you can wait outside with him and I'll bring out your bowl\". Not only did her comment and the tone  infuriate me but it also made me feel belittled, obviously my dog is a service dog which you can identify by the tag and his behavior as he just sat still next to me the whole time I stood there. I went ahead and just waited outside anyway because at that point I didn't even want to see her, so after 10 minutes she comes outside and brings me my bowl, with no lid on it, honey was dripped all over the side and I was not given a bag. If you make a customer wait outside for the food they ordered the least you can do is bring them a lid and a bag.  -the ingredients used were low quality so the actual bowl is not worth $8.00"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their drinks. Unfortunately ,they don't allow to bring your own cup, but I was able to use my own straw."}
{"text":"The girls are very chatty. It was my first time so I inquired about sugar and calories. If I would have known that it was an issue to ask a question I would have not gone to buy a $9 bowl. It seemed as tho I was a bother to the young lady. Upon leaving I asked if they had a yelp and she laughed and said yea are you going to put a good review. I said nothing and the other girl laughed and said oh no hahhahaa she didn't say anything so that means no !! Then they both started to laugh loud and obnoxiously. I will return but I will speak to Corp first. Awesome first experience"}
{"text":"I don't really recommend this place, with all the cool poke bowls and food shops opening recently hah, it wasn't very good. The fish is very fresh, but they drowned my both dishes in sauce, I can pour it into a cup. And even though I want and can excuse that, the rice was really hard, like uncomfortable hard. Good tasting and flavor, but definitely wasn't up to par with most shops around. I got the upstream bowl with extra seaweed... not cool when you tip your bowl and the sauce spills."}
{"text":"The Hula acai bowl was really good. All the other reviews say they're kinda pricey, but I wouldn't know, I've never had an acai bowl at any other place before lol. Their smoothie prices were pretty high though, and by the description of what's in their smoothies, they didn't seem anything out of the ordinary.  I went in when it was pretty busy, I guess. It took 30 minutes for us to get our bowls. Everyone who was there before us apparently were waiting for a long time as well. There were only 2 people working; 1 stayed in the back making the orders and the second worker was back and forth, taking orders and making them. I thought it was weird that when we ordered at the counter, he asked for our names and wrote them on the bowls, but when he was calling out the completed orders through the window to be picked up, he called them out by what the bowls were and not by the names of the customers. So every time he said \"Hula Acai bowl\", everyone that was waiting kinda just looked at each other because how the hell are we supposed to know who that bowl belongs to lol. So that caused a LOT of confusion and 1 angry customer (not me lol).  I think this was just an off business day for them. But aside from the service, the bowls were very good and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bowlology replaced Bowl of Heaven. It's pretty much the same concept but there are key differences. Their Acai bowls come in 2 sizes: regular or large. They have Acai bowls, smoothies, and juice shots. They don't have a rewards program like BOH did.   PB Lover: I have a go-to Acai bowl in places that serve Acai bowls: Acai bowl with peanut butter. So, I tried their PB Lover. It has Acai, chocolate mylk, peanut butter, strawberries, banana, honey and chocolate chips. It was pretty similar to BOH's PB bowl but with the addition of chocolate chips on top. I asked for 22g of protein to be added to my Acai bowl and I was told they only have 11g. Seriously? So, if I wanted to pay extra, I still can't get another 11g? 4/5 for the Acai bowl; 1/5 for the lack of logic/math skills.  Chocolate Dream: Chocolate, strawberry, bananas, granola, honey and chocolate chips. This was just ok - nothing special. 2.5/5  My Acai bowl trips while on campus will now be limited and uninspired."}
{"text":"Clean facilities. Friendly staff. Low value, unfortunately.  $11 poke bowl offered 6 slices of cucumbers, a handful of edamame, a small serving of salmon, a splash of ponzu, and a whole lot of brown rice. In my personal opinion, an arguably fair amount of salmon, but certainly a poor veggie to rice ratio. Thus, a low value in my opinion.  Honestly wanted to like the establishment, as it is walking distance and a healthier alternative when eating out. Unfortunately I'm unable to find the value."}
{"text":"Love this place. Found my new favorite spot. Must try the berry good. Great breakfast on the go."}
{"text":"I got an açai bowl from here and they topped it with starberrries that were soaked in syrup or something & not fresh at all. When you get an acai bowl, it should be topped with fresh fruit! This looked like it was defrosted and soggy. Sad. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Best Acai Bowl place I've been in, definitely not going anywhere again! Everytime I call in, they have my order ready to pick up the moment I get there. Fast and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I always wondered what this place was like. Finally decided to try it and thought it was just okay. The guy working in the front was not friendly and also not helpful. It was our first time so we were looking for a recommendation.   We placed our order of a tofu bowl and a poke bowl. I thought the prices were really high. They really don't have that many things to choose from. I asked for a water cup and they gave me the tiniest cup in the world. It was literally one swallow. Uhm why? This is the desert and people drink water here. I would have been happy to pay for a cup where I could have gotten at least a full mouthful of water.   The girl in the back making the food seemed stressed and the wait was really long for the food. We were the only one in the place at the time. I am sure I will not return. It's not really worth it."}
{"text":"We eat here a few time already and we like it alot The fruit are fresh and taste good I will recommend this place to all of my friends   Good job guys !"}
{"text":"I've been coming her since before they switched over to bowlology. Since the switch it's gone down hill for sure and I was in the area today decided why not stop in. Upon entering the guy working the counter, believe he had gauged ears and a backwards hat didn't great ya instead looked away like we were bothering him. You guys are probably one of the worst quality locations, I'll take my business to vitality bowls which is far better!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get a regular size acai bowl! Chocolate dream is my favorite! I've only been to this location & the staff is very friendly. They're also a very clean establishment! I appreciate when they walk out from around the bar & bring you your items! Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"My boss and I are both obsessed with this place! There's one near work and my house thus (literally) feeding my obsession. And I'm a proud stamp card holder racking up points to get free bowls...just to clarify my level of obsession with this place, I have a punch card and talk to my boss about it haha They have both fruit and sushi bowls, but I stick to the açaí ones cause it's basically a healthy dessert. It's better for you than smoothies (less sugar and they use real fruit), and when you get one with some chocolate in it, it's a dessert you can validate eating easier than cake heehee ;) I can't tell you which bowl is my favorite, that'd be like picking a favorite child. Therefore everything is good and good for you! I love this place for making healthy eating more palatable"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a smoothie place close to home. The smoothies and bowls are yummy. I especially like the peanut butter chocolate bowl.   However, the furniture frustrates me. I can only get my smoothies and bowls to go. The furniture is not kid friendly and seating is limited. I have been here twice in two days. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"The Hula bowl is a really good fruity and refreshing choice and the PB/Bear bowls are really good sweet options.  They're adding poke to their menu which already has smoothies and juices.  The staff is nice and I like the rewards program! In addition, they have a great snack selection and drinks cooler which is great because healthy options like this aren't available on campus.  PS instead of acai... do pitaya!"}
{"text":"I love acai bowls and i used to be a regular going in every day before work . I started to notice that my bowls were getting less and less blended . My acai bowls were getting smaller. I had mentioned it one time to them that it was happening and i just got a nasty look back. Love acai but wont be getting my service anymore !! I pay almost $10 and you would think they would attempt to give you good service."}
{"text":"Only giving it 3 stars because for one their prices are a little more expensive then most . The toppings are minimal and the flavor for the PB is beyond over powering . The peanut butter is all you can taste the acai is non existent. I think so far fruits and roots is the best place in Vegas I've tried this far ."}
{"text":"Normally, I'd give 5 stars, but after they made a mistake and gave us the wrong food, we told them and all we got was attitude. It was disappointing because I like the owner. I spoke to the shift Sunday and she said, \"Oh, like I'm totally sorry.\" Me, too."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place! Delicious acai bowls with different blends and toppings than other places I've seen! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is very good, I purchased a Hula Açaí bowl today but the fruit didn't taste all that fresh. I'd give it 5 stars, but the strawberry's were very tangy rather then sweet. It was the first time coming to the summerlin location and the service was \"okay\" centennial crew seem more friendlier. Hoping next time I visit the summerlin one the bowl would be a bit sweeter rather than tangy."}
{"text":"I just left the centennial location and got a Makai bowl for the first time. And my normal Hula bowl... but I was questioning if the Makai bowl usually comes this empty. Check out the comparison in both bowls. My Hula was equally leveled but the Makai bowl was not full at all! What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Giving this place a 4 star because the prices are a bit high.  However they do honor military and that's fantastic! Glad to have a healthy snack option in the area other than fast food.  Check this place out because it's a chill atmosphere, clean and good for you!  Girls working are very friendly and nice. Thank you.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Let me say that I have been here close to 7 times since I first started coming which tells you that I actually enjoy their bowls! The silky thick consistency is perhaps my favorite part beating out the competitors Like Jamba, Nektar and Juice n Go!  It almost pains me to say that this would be a 5 star review if not for the spotty service. I've had maybe one or two times were the workers were friendly but most of the times (as other reviewers have stated) the workers were goofing off and weren't very friendly.   Perhaps most importantly without fail, for the last three visits, my order has been Rise n Shine without pineapple and I've gotten pineapple ALL THREE TIMES. I always order to go (to share with my boyfriend) so I didn't check the first time. I double confirmed the second time and I unfortunately gave them the benefit of the doubt the third time.   Overall great bowls but the service could use some work!"}
{"text":"Got a berry bowl , the price was reasonable I guess. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the customer service is a little on the crap side . I waited 5 minutes to get my order taken and there was only one other customer in there... I was almost tempted to walk out. Glad I didn't though , because my berry bowl was delicious."}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly and efficient establishment. However I feel like they should only focus on their juices and acai bowls. I know the trend now are pokè bowls but I think they would do just fine without it. The Up Stream bowl was plain with no flavoring. I was kinda thrown off guard when I received it bc my salmon was warm and was expecting a cool, refreshing flavor.  I'll update my review next time with their wide selection of acai bowls."}
{"text":"Ordered the hula bowl with both acai & pitaya. It was really refreshing and yummy. I would've chosen for some more of the fruits to have been toppings instead of blended in, that could be improved the overall taste. It took half an hour to wait for my bowl and the other bowl we ordered. Nice that there's another acai place close to home. Still like juice n go better."}
{"text":"The bowls here are really good, but quite frankly the majority of their workers are rude. My family and friends all come here and have had the same experience. They don't greet any customers nicely, have a negative attitude and look miserable to be at work. The only time i've had a positive experience is when i was served by an asian girl. I went out of my way to go to the other location and they weren't much better."}
{"text":"Eh. It's ok I guess I tried two different smoothies and one juice. Nothing special about them. The red dragon smoothie wasn't good so much got something different. Maybe they make good bowl or their poke is good. I do t know"}
{"text":"When they 1st opened I was addicted to this place. I literally had to have their Hula Acai bowl at least once a week. But as the months went by the less I came.   Facility is always clean and staff was always nice. (Reason for the 3 stars).   I realized after time my take out Acai Hula changed a lot. It used to be 1/3 fruits and 2/3 acai. Which is great. Then the fruits came less and less and a lot less. Today I decided to go there again because it's been awhile and it's even worse :( i would say 1/8 fruit!! I no longer feel like I can spend $10 on this :( luckily I had extra fruits at home to make up for the bunch of acai I had left.   In regards to the Poke bowls. It was a one and done thing. Very little poke for $11. Compared to other poke bowls in Vegas it was quite terrible to look at."}
{"text":"This place is good but not too bad, located in a great location. I ordered the acai with chocolate which was pretty tasty. I wished I added coconut to balance he taste."}
{"text":"Hate to do this but very overpriced $20 for two large fresh juices? Overpriced yes quality no. I understand it's a business but don't rip people off. Did you switch I ordered was the green one and it was nothing but lemon very little taste of cucumber very disappointing. For nine dollars I could've made 5 gallons of juice"}
{"text":"They just changed the name to Bowlology but it's the same inside. Delicious Acai bowl called Berry Good bowl is a winner, but of course it ain't cheap."}
{"text":"Decent and moderately priced. The selection is solid and was generally happy with the elections that I have gotten over the last couple of days. The interior is nice, oddly laid out and does not maximise the space like it could. Would have given it 5 stars if honestly I felt like the people behind the counter actually gave one iota of interest in anything. They literally were like zombies, no energy, just went through the motions. I know it is not like a career defining track in life, but if you don't put energy into it or at the very least smile when someone comes to the counter, you will be looking for another menial job because this place will be out of business."}
{"text":"The facilities are clean and nice. I do believe they serve great acia bowls and smoothie. If you are coming for poke you will be sadly disappointed. This shouldn't be a surprise coming from a smoothie shop attempting to cash in on the booming poke popularity."}
{"text":"I've come here twice in the span of 72 hours. I've never had an acai bowl before and decided to come here when I was dying for some potassium to quell some killer cramps. I figured I could get something with bananas.   Ordering was confusing. I told the girl at the front that I had never been there before. I figured the menu board behind the cashier was it. Actually you order from the menu located in the back. Each type of bowl has (b) blended ingredients and (t) toppings. Like I said, I had never ordered this before so I thought b & t were different variations. I ordered \"a bear bowl. I guess the \" t\" option.\" The cashier explained that wasn't a thing. I wish the menu board explained it because I felt dumb!   I liked the bear bowl. It tastes like how I think froyo should taste. Unfortunately, a froyo sized cup is $9.95! I tried the chocolate dream ($7.95) also and it had no chocolate flavor other than the chocolate chips.   While the bear bowl was delicious, I can't afford this on the regular. There was no loyalty card either. I ended up going to Whole Foods to buy acai packs and goji berries to make my own bowls at home with all the other ingredients that I already have.  In general, while too pricy for me to enjoy regularly, I enjoyed the ambience & food. Also this knocked out cramps in about 3 minutes."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite acai and poke bowl spot, but we have been really disappointed as of late.   We went for lunch and were given a half-hearted greeting from the guy behind the counter. We ordered 2 poke bowls (the og and wicked tuna) and an PB Lover bowl. When we ordered the bowl, we were not asked if we wanted acai or pitaya.   It took FOREVER for our bowls (at least 15 minutes). There was only one person in line behind us and she got her bowl first. Maybe they need to hire more staff? Who knows....anyway if the food was perfect, the wait would not have mattered.   The wicked tuna was really good but some of the larger pieces of tuna were frozen solid! No flavor and almost inedible. The OG bowl had so much sauce. Way too salty and again, the tuna was frozen. Complete disappointment.   The acai bowl was good, but I wish there was more of it. The bowl was half base and half toppings. If I wanted a bowl of fruit and granola, I'd order that.   Not sure what's going on with this place, but sadly, it has gone down hill quickly."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. Tried a variety things from the menu and was not disappointed. The staff was friendly and accommodating and not in the phone anyway. Place has kind of a Starbucks feel but without the too cool hipsters. I found the food to be healthy and extremely fresh considering I watch them cut and peel the fruit in front of me. My only regret is that I do not have this place right next door to my house"}
{"text":"Stopped by before heading to Costco, tried the traditional Makai bowl and the Mango Madness smoothie, however i have to say I had the worst customer service here. I wish I knew the name of the girl working at the time, absolutely disgusted with her attitude."}
{"text":"Looove this place and it's the best acai bowl ever. I usually get the Makai bowl with pitaya (dragon fruit). It's blended acai with fresh fruits (strawberries) and atop with the crunchy granola. It's so refreshing and healthy. Con is the wait for the bowl can take some time... Otherwise love the acai bowl!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  This location is on my way to work and one of the only places to get fresh and delicious cold pressed juice before 9am in that area!  Everyone is always so friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and decorated beautifully.  I am so happy to see there are so many new locations across town so I am always in close proximity to one!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the second time... to give it another try. Came here about a year and a half and didn't like my acai bowl.   Had the regular hula bowl and I won't be back. I make acai bowls on my own at home for over 10 years. The bowl here lacks acai. Acai is dark purple my bowl was very light purple and didn't taste like acai. I feel like the bowl is blended mostly with banana and other frozen fruit not acai. If there is acai in there it's not much.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"We love coming here- great place to have a healthy snack right after the gym! Knowing how the waiting time can be long, we usually call in prior and it's pretty much  ready for us to pick up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The decor is so fun and cool in here that you will want to replicate it for your own home!   The location is amazingly convenient for a busy Summerlin mom on-the-go. It's a great healthy alternative to all the fast food options in that area.   I've been following them on Instagram at \"AcaiToTheT\" for a month now and they do an awesome job of creating a variety of beautiful bowls.   My almost 3 year old is your typical picky eater, and even he can't resist a pretty purple bowl of yumminess."}
{"text":"What a perfect quick stop for a healthy and delicious lunch!  I drive by this restaurant almost every day, silly me!  Fresh food and quick and friendly service!  I'll be back again, and bring friends!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last weekend and I've been craving it ever since. It was super refreshing on a hot day. I do wish it came in a different kind of container and a smaller choice in size since cut fruit doesn't stay fresh overnight and the smallest size they have was a bit to much for me. I ended up tossing my leftovers the next day which bummed me out. Otherwise I really enjoyed my bowl."}
{"text":"The poke bowl I ordered here was great and the portions are good but I think the price is a little bit more compared to other places that have poke bowls in Vegas. I ordered the wicked tuna poke bowl which was $11.00 and I added salmon for $3.00, seaweed for $0.75, and green onions for $0.50. It came out to $16.51 with tax. I have been to several places around town that have poke bowls that will let you add all kinds of toppings for a set price and allow you to do half salmon half tuna (which is what I wanted) without charging $3.00 more for the salmon. Having said that, the poke bowl itself was yum and everything tasted fresh and good. Probably one of the freshest tasting poke bowls I have had in Vegas, but somehow not as inspiring and creative with the flavors and toppings. Kind of a generic poke bowl, but still good. I would go back :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Acai in Vegas. \"Juice n Go\" on rainbow is repulsive in comparison to this place. (It's actually pretty repulsive any day of the week). I got the body builder and it is AMAZING!! I didn't give them FIVE STARS because I found a hair a few bites into my bowl. :/ yuck. So I suggest you ask the girls to tie their hair back! Lol wear a net!! Will be back regardless."}
{"text":"Really good. Sizes are sometimes inconsistent. I ordered two large and there was about 2 inch height difference in them."}
{"text":"I love acai bowls, and I usually go to Nektar and Pressed for Juice. I was recommended the acai bowls here by a friend, who claims to really like them. However, she also mentioned the downside of this place as well: terrible customer service. So I thought I'd come in to check it out and grab one of their good bowls. I ordered the pb lovers bowl, and I have no complaints - it was great. The customer service, on the other hand, not so much. It was exactly as she had warned me. Every single person who was working in there had such an attitude and was in no way friendly or hospitable. They don't even acknowledge you when you walk in, more so when you're even right in front of them at the counter. I even interacted with the manger, as I came to find out later, and she was no better.. maybe even worse. You would think she would be setting an example for the workers, yet now I know why the workers treat the customers with such disrespect. Definitely disappointed that my experience here was ruined, as I expected the same  customer service and friendly greetings that I receive at my normal places."}
{"text":"Amazing wicked Tuna bowl!! So so so good! Price was only $10 plenty of food, tuna was fresh!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Expensive and honestly the smoothie that is healthy for you is not the best tasting. Great customer service.  Expensive"}
{"text":"I love how close this location is to my house. It's super accessible and has it's own parking lot. Major bonus, they also serve Poke bowls after 11am! I haven't gone savory just yet, but I like the option!  Every time I have made it in, there is always the same girl working. She doesn't wear a name tag and it's much too busy to ask her, but this girl hustles. She takes the orders and preps all the bowls. She's like a machine!  The bowls themselves are huge though and each one is easy to customize. They also aren't overly sweet. I enjoyed the PB Lover and swapped the chocolate almond milk for vanilla, I also devoured the Berry Goodness and swapped the almond milk for apple juice. Every modification is made with a smile and I get exactly what I want. I plan on making my way through the menu through each visit.   Bowlology dulls my cravings for an acai bowl and make my belly scream #nomnomnom."}
{"text":"Bowlology differentiates itself amongst other super-foods & juice bars out here. I've had plenty, visited tons of establishments with the same concept but something about this company/brand just blows me away every time I visit! From its purity of flavors, you can definitely taste the freshness and heart that this place offers!   The first time I've had Bowlology was early 2016, I wasn't a fan of \"checking in\" on yelp but if I had, It'd probably be more than 20. They offer a variety of fusion goodies that just compliments each other in a way that it's addictive. I mean, addiction is bad, however, I'd give this place an exception.  Reasonably priced with the quality the comes with, a modern,simplistic,spacious shop that can cater to us hungry customers AND a welcoming, friendly workforce. I mean, can you beat that?  Huge shoutout to Dillon and Josh for crafting such an amazing concept! I met these gentlemen in my shop and I was crazed when I found out they were the creators of this awesome business, being said that they even offered me a free Acai! But that's for another topic!   Keep up the fantastic job guys!"}
{"text":"First time here at Bowlology. I ordered the Spicy Shoyu. It was ok. Maybe it just wasn't what I expected. The tuna was ok (could of been fresher) and it wasn't spicy in my opinion. I might try again. Next time I'll try a smoothie and maybe a fruit bowl."}
{"text":"Oh goodness. This place is the awesome but these kids that work here can't keep the orders straight. Especially when you here during your lunch hour. I order a Berry Good bowl and didn't receive it until 20 minutes later. They gave my partner his bowl but mine never came out. They gave my order to someone else and made an extra one for the other party and had to give it away to someone else since I didn't want it. Great acai bowls but the kids working there fail on staying organized."}
{"text":"Ok the only reason why they got any stars from me was because the juice I ordered, it tastes delicious. However I'm very put off by the really dirty counter tops & floor and by the 2 girls with purple hair that are currently working today. No smile, no hello, just stood there looking bothered that I was there disturbing their conversation. Super unfriendly staff. Maybe they should take a moment from their convo and clean this place. There are crumbs, splattered berries on the floor, and sticky countertops. Makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like?! Yikes! Too bad I probably won't be back here because the juice is really good but everything else was well... kinda gross!  :("}
{"text":"Love the fresh organic ingredients!  It is a cozy place to relax as well.  We are working on tasting the whole menu, but the Makai is impressive.  Best tasting acai ever!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! So delicious and you can make it healthy! I have multiple modifications to my order and the staff has it memorized. They are always very friendly :) Between the Pitaya and Acai, I always choose the Pitaya since it is the lower sugar option. The Body Builder Bowl is no longer on their new menu, however they still make it for me. My order: Pitaya Body Builder, no juice/add vanilla almond milk, add 1 scoop vanilla whey protein, no strawberries/add blueberries, no honey. They always make it perfectly:)"}
{"text":"In the mood for an acai bowl, I decided to give this place a try.   When you walk in, it's a little confusing as to where to order and the ordering process. The menu wall is in the back of the restaurant instead of at the cashier and there was no signage to direct me what to do or where to order. Finally the guy from the back let me know to go to the back and put my order in with the guys and then pay at the counter once I was done. They could improve this process or make it more convenient. I ordered and waited for my bowl.   They were pretty quick and once they called my name, I paid and picked up my bowl. I asked for a rewards card, but the guy explained that there previous card offered a free bowl after purchasing 5 and that they were getting killed on it. They will have new ones printed soon, he explained.  The bowl was basic, but sweeter than others I've had before. They add a little too much Apple juice and it overwhelmed the flavor of the bowl. The texture was fine but after a while everything was a runny, overly sweet mess and I couldn't finish it. If I came back I'd likely ask for less honey and apple juice, but I don't see myself making this spot a regular stop on my rotation."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. The prices for the acai bowl is okay but it's worth it. When I come here I always get the Berry Good or the Sea Breeze."}
