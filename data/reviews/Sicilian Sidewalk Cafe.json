{"text":"Sure, the ice cream might be good, but as many reviewers have mentioned, the service SUCKS!  I went there the other day, and was scolded by a rude old lady working there for a dumb reason (I bought 3 tartufo and my friend and I was eating them beside their game machines, and she yelled at me stating it was 'not ok because the price is different for eat-in')  Alright, I didn't realize this, but really, in this day and age they should be fortunate they have business.  As well, the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"I've been to Sicilian several times before but I stopped going ever since my last bad experience with them. After more than 5 months of depriving myself from Sicilian, I decided to give them another shot since I've always remembered them having the most delicious waffles. The only problem I had with them before was that their service really sucked ass (always slow and the staff never seemed happy serving paying customers!)  This time around, their service noticeably improved as they were more attentive and orders moved more smoothly. Feeling more at ease because of this, it allowed me to enjoy my Strawberry Waffle in peace. The Fantasia (homemade vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberries drizzled in strawberry sauce with a little whip cream) is by far my favourite dessert to get. They make the creamiest and most delicious ice cream served on top of your choice of a hot fresh Belgium waffle or in a soft crepe (yuuumm!). Their serving portions are huge with fair pricing so you might find it convienient sharing your dessert between 2 people. They also have a nice side walk patio which is great for the summer!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars* This is my go to place when my friends and I are craving crepes/waffles when in Little Italy.  Prices are reasonable- I think it was roughly $8 for a waffle and $7 for a crepe and the portions are large.  There's a wide selection of desserts so you may end up mulling over the menu for awhile. It's a cute, old school mom and pop cafe feel to it which is a nice contrast to other places that go for the stark white or dark espresso wood decor.    I chose the Tanti Baci crepe which is a crepe with 2 large scoops of bacio ice cream, nutella and hazelnut inside.  Delicious.   I also had the Americano which I left unfinished.  Halfway through, I found it to be bitter.  Meh...maybe I'll just stick to the desserts next time."}
{"text":"I don't know much about the italian food culture aside from pastas, pizzas, and calzones, but when it comes to ice cream and gelato, I'm all for it. After one of my cousins said that the gelato crepes at Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe were the best ever, I knew I had to try for myself. The place has a nice patio, and I imagine it would be a pretty popular spot in the summer. The prices of the desserts were very reasonable, bordering on the side of cheap for the portions that you get. There were three of us and we ordered a crepe to share and found the portions to be just enough. Mind you though we already had a lot to eat before that.  Tanti Bacci Crepe -Bacci ice cream, Hazlenuts, Nutella chocolate spread, and whipped cream  I think my cousin wasn't too far off from describing it as the best crepe he's had in Toronto. It was in fact very very good. It looks so simple, but it was the little details that made it much better than some other crepes I've had.   First off, the whipped cream was real whipped cream. None of that artificial stuff that comes from a can. It was so creamy and really smooth. The two generous scoops of ice cream itself was like eating Ferrero Rocher. it had little bits of hazelnut inside the ice cream that somehow were still crunchy despite being refrigerated with the ice cream. The actual hazelnut bits gave it extra crunch, and weren't stale like some nuts you get from other crepe places. What impressed me the most was the crepe. it was made to just the right thickness and had a nice elasticity/chewiness to it. I think I would've enjoyed eating just the crepe by itself. I also wanted to point out that the chocolate sauce and crepe was folded in a way that the ice cream did not make the crepe soggy when it melted. Hard to explain, but as a result of it, even the last bite tasted like eating a fresh new crepe.  I can't vouch for anything else on the menu, but from this one dessert alone, II would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"F-ing MASSIVE chocolate crepe with white choloate chips on top I received yesterday after bellavista nearby. I must say, for the price, you get your worth, at least in terms of sheer size of ice cream you are getting, that thing looked like a giant burrito.  With that said, I enjoyed it, but not the greatest, you can get better crepe from wanda or dimitri, but this café has personality and would be a nice spot to chill at and people watch once the weather gets warm. For that it's a nice spot to be at."}
{"text":"I went here on May 5, 2013, around 1600 hrs for the first time.  Had a large cappuccino, cannoli, one scope each of tiramisu and pistachio gelato.    The service was very slow from beginning, i.e., getting a menu, ordering, to end, i.e., getting the bill, finding waiter/waitress to pay.  The cappuccino was weak--more milk than coffee.  The cannoli cream was good, not overly sweet, but the cannoli shell was too sweet!  I ate two small pieces of the shell and left the rest.  The gelato tasted more like ice cream and, in retrospect, lacked any distinct flavor except for sweetness.  Vaccaro's in Baltimore, MD (USA) makes better gelato.   The washrooms are one floor down some steps and they were clean enough.  Wifi would have been nice, but this was not a negative in my rating.  I am giving this 3 stars only for the good cannoli cream, but cannot recommend the place otherwise.  Very disappointing, since the outdoor seating area was completely full of people and the inside about half full when I arrived."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had good service at the Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe, yet, somehow I always manage to find myself back there. It's got a large patio which is great for people watching - if you can get a seat.   Most recently I had the Tanti baci  crepe - nutella and crushed hazelnuts in between the crepe layers, which is then folded over two generous scoops of  baci ice cream. Putting the nutella and hazlenuts in between the crepe layers was a little detail, but genius - it was like a layer of cake wrapped around the ice cream.   I found it weird that the server brought my coffee with the milk already in the coffee, instead of on the side like most places; I don't remember them doing that before. I suggest the owners hire more staff to serve patrons more efficiently, but I guess they figure if people keep coming back, they don't need to."}
{"text":"I've ended up here quite a few times when I've been craving something sweet after 9 p.m. on a weeknight.  The place is rarely crowded (weekends are a different story, though), the menu is full of delicious things (oh, the tartufi!  It'll be many more visits before I've exhausted all the choices), and the patio is great for people-watching.  It's a good, safe choice for a sugar craving--I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to grab some coffee late one night last week, and we thought the Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe would be a no-brainer for a place to hang out and catch up over a warm drink. It was nice that the patio was still open, but it felt like it took a really long time for any of the servers to notice we were sitting there waiting for our order to be taken...then we ordered 2 decaf cappuccinos (because it was late) and waited. When the waitress finally brought them to our table, she apologized for them, saying she didn't know how to make them, and that she couldn't find someone to do a better job...I appreciate that it was late, and she was doing her best, but since when is it a superhuman feat to make a cappuccino at a CAFE?! In any case, the cappuccinos were served in glass (??) mugs and honestly tasted like the worst milky coffee. Weak and not at all the quality of coffee you would expect from (a) a cafe, and (b) an Italian cafe, at that!!! By this point we were pretty much just jones-ing for a hot beverage, so we drank them as quickly as possible, paid for them (really? 4.50 including tax for bad coffee?) and got the heck out of there. Unfortunate, because I've heard good things about the place otherwise - maybe a bit overrated these days, riding on laurels of years ago? Won't be going back for coffee, there are too many better places in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Sicilian Sidewalk café plenty of times and I really like it! I find the prices to be reasonable, the food and the portions are great, the coffee drinks are very enjoyable and the staff is always friendly. I never felt rushed at this café; it's always comfortable and fun. I also love their big menu and the variety of food, desserts, and drinks!  Every time I visit this café I've only seen one server for the entire place (I've been there during the mornings only) and when it gets a tad bit packed the service can get slow. I see people at the cafe a bit upset with the slow service, but what can the server do? There is only one person for the entire place, that person can't serve 10 people at once. The place needs more waiters/waitresses!   I've only had one bad experience at Sicilian Sidewalk Café which was that my water glass was not cleaned properly, it had a funky smell and it totally grossed me out. Despite that, I gave this place another shot and had a yummy and clean experience.  I plan to enjoy this café again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot on College for an espresso! I haven't had much except sweets or coffee from them but keep coming back!  The ice cream on a hot summer night always hits the spot... especially out on their large wrap around patio!"}
{"text":"The best Sicilian cannoli's outside of Sicily itself. They're always made to order so they're never soggy. My favourite dessert bar in the city by far and the prices are very reasonable. If you are a Nutella addict such as myself I highly recommend the Tanti Baci. It is a crepe smothered in Nutella and stuffed with 2 generous scoops of Baci flavoured gelato, along with crushed hazelnuts and icing sugar. It will make your eyes roll to the back of your head in enjoyment guaranteed! The patio in summer is a great spot spend time with a special someone or a group of friends. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I know people say the service is a bit slow but I am not too bothered by it.  We went there on Tuesday after dinner so it was pretty quiet.  My boyfriend and I shared the Waffle with caramel and ice cream (can't remember the name, but it was nutty and yummy) and 2 coffees.  They could do a little better by offering brewed decaf vs instant for a coffee place.   Other than that it's a good place for after dinner, or just a treat."}
{"text":"Sicilian sidewalk cafe has a very chill atmosphere. The interior is spacious and clean.   I ordered a lemon bombetta, it was absolutely delicious. It had a mild, smooth texture which I enjoyed very much. I also ordered a hazelnut latte. The latte was slightly too sweet for my tasting but it was still well made.   The three big screens are a little weird to be put in a cafe type of place, but I had some fun watching Pope Francis visiting the U.S. while I was there.   I went at night so it was not busy at all. I was pretty much the only one who occupied the cafe.  Overall rating is definitely a 5."}
{"text":"Been frequenting this place for years, for the  coffee. Highly recommended for a great coffee in little Italy. Made just the way you like it. And from time to time I may grab a panini there. Usually just the veal with provolone. Have never been disappointed with one. Hits the spot, and a great bargain for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Good spot for people watching. Likes to call itself Toronto's oldest gelato spot. May be true. What is definitely true is that it is one of Toronto's least good gelato spots. Tasted like no-name brand fruit juice poured over ice. Not great."}
{"text":"Ce petit café vous propose toute une panoplie de desserts, gaufres, glaces, crèmes - c'est normal c'est leur spécialité. Leurs petits déjeuners sont copieux, les antipasto sont bons mais c'est surtout la personnalité attachante de Monsieur Natale qui fait que l'on y retourne régulièrement."}
{"text":"I met a friend of mine here. It was in the snowy Sunday afternoon before closing. There were not so many customers, but I felt relaxed. There were TVs and there were many seats and tables. They have lots of desserts and pastries. They have varieties of coffee and espresso and combination of espresso and Ice cream. They have tea and juice, too. It is nice. The prices are pretty reasonable. I really liked this place. Desserts and pastries are very delicious. The service was good. The young lady with a pair of glasses was very kind and gentle. I would love to come back there again."}
{"text":"They should get perfect stars because there icecream is that good and priced great why don't they get perfect stars .it's because of the bad service they seem angry  Like if you walk in there your making them work . It's been like this for years . There icecream can be found all over the GTA at most bakeries  and high end stores . Bad energy always from staff . If all care about is tips work on your attitude ."}
{"text":"My friend and I had brunch here. NEVER AGAIN. The food waas below average and more importantly, the service was horrible. Our server forgot our orders and when the food arrived, we received everything we did NOT order. When we told her, she was quite annoyed. We are not picky people in any regard but the service was something that had to reflect in our tip. Will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"I would rate my overall experience as 3.5! They have a medium sized outdoor area and we were seated quickly! The service was just okay.. There were sweet servers and there were others that seemed to rush everything and that's the main reason I gave it a 3.5.   I ordered Tiramisu ice cream which was DELICIOUS! The ice cream it self deserves a 5 star! It was served with biscuits soaked in espresso and topped with whipped cream and coco powder! It is a must!   It's average priced; we got a beer, cider and shared the Ice cream, the total price was about $25."}
{"text":"Amazing desserts. A must-go if you're in the area. Love their waffles, gelatos and other desserts. Some of my favorites are Tutto Noce, Bombetta Affocata, Raspberry Bombetta."}
{"text":"Been going here for over twenty years. Great place, good ice cream and coffee, good prices. It is rather reasonable versus demerits, baskin robbins, etc. Once of my favourite places to hang out at with friends on a weekend, after work, etc. Too many hipsters have started hanging around there, but meh, that is everywhere now a days."}
{"text":"A wide range of cakes, waffles, crepes, gelati, tartufi and other Italian desserts can be ordered with a good cup of coffee or any sort of espresso (or something stronger and/or crowned with whipped cream) at this bustling College Street cafe, plus there's decent panini and a tasty antipasto plate (love the spicy olives!) if you're around for lunch or a snack.  It's spacious and bright and reasonably priced, the patio is great for people-watching, and it stays open late, but... the service is irritatingly slow, even when it's not exactly packed full! If you're patient, come here with friends and spend some time chilling out and indulging your sweet tooth, but if you just want to pop in for a coffee and a bite to eat you might be better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after we had dinner at another restaurant.  This cafe is really cute and nice because the waitress doesn't bug you and rush you to leave.  The only flaw is that the waitress did not check on us after we placed our initial orders.  We would have liked to have received waters with our orders.  I had to leave our table to ask the waitress to bring us glasses of water.  I had to do this twice before she brought them to us.  I also had to track the waitress down to order another latte.  I just wish she would have checked on us to see if we needed anything.  This experience was definitely a 2 out of 5.  However my friends really enjoyed the desserts that they purchased.  The crepe with ice cream is huge and it looked delicious!  My friend loved it!  Another idea for this cafe would be to offer gluten free entrees and desserts."}
{"text":"4 of us waited 30 mins for the coffee, got up and left, totally ignored the whole time."}
{"text":"Great place. The service is very friendly and prompt. My espresso was perfect. I had tiramisu, and it was solid. I have had better but this one was tasty and smooth, and nice but not amazing. Next time I go (and there will be the next time), I will try something else. If you are planning to take crepes or waffles - the portions are huge - so you have been warned! :)"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Sicilian Cafe for years and we've always enjoyed our experience. Unfortunately, our recent visit was very disappointing and as a result we will not be coming back. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to have our order taken and once it was our server did not come back (not even to give us the bill.) So, we were forced to go in and pay for our order. Also, a few of us couldn't wait, and went up to the front to order our ice cream but were refused several times because we had chosen a table and they offered table service even tho we advised them that nobody had helped us yet. The ice cream selection was also very limited and not very good."}
{"text":"Location: 712 College Street, Toronto, ON M6G 1C3 Price: $$ Service: Good  This place has one of the best waffle in Toronto! It is just sooo good... Crunch on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. I am usually a crepe person but man was I disappointed with their crepe. It was hard and thick- not good at all. If you are choosing between the two, definitely go with the waffle. It was amazeballs and the waffle goes with all the flavours that they have!  The server was really nice and checked up on us often.   Verdict: must try!"}
{"text":"In the sea of restaurants, gelaterias and bars that is Little Italy, I think you'd have to live here a lifetime to visit every jaunty establishment...but when the summer comes, my focus hones in on places with a) patios, b) booze and c) dessert.  So how exciting is it to find a place that combines all three?  Sicilian's is just that...a great place to hang out pre-dinner, after-dinner or maybe FOR dinner if you've got a mammoth sweet tooth.  They've got a lovely patio, friendly wait staff and, on really nice summer nights, a line out the door!  But let's be honest, the thing that really whips people up about this place (pun totally intended) is the dessert.  And it's a well-deserved hype.  Whether you're craving cake, pie, crepes, waffles, tartufo or sundaes...they have it all...and it's most likely smothered in chocolate, carmel, whip cream and/or nutella to boot.    But the best thing has got to be the gelato itself.  Authentic Italian flavours (bacio, nocciola, pistachio, spumoni...you name it, they've got it) that melt in your mouth, make your tastebuds rejoice and then  travel to your hips where they set up camp (much to my chagrin).  But it's so good, it doesn't matter...and if that's not enough and you want more?  You can buy your very own tub of each flavour and take them home where you can chill out on your own patio and indulge.  A great neighbourhood establishment with a bustling atmosphere that everyone can appreciate.  With alcohol and coffees also available, there's something for everyone.  Another bonus?  Pretty inexpensive too!"}
{"text":"Best cannolis in Toronto! This is our go-to dessert spot if we're anywhere in the West End, especially if we want to stay out late but not drink.   They also do espresso poured over ice cream like no other.   If you're there in the summer, hit up the patio. It's huge and great for people-watching.   The only down side is that you sometimes have to wave your arms to get the attention of the waiter/waitress. It's relatively minor, in my opinion, since this is the kind of place you go to have a leisurely end-of-night. And the staff there are very friendly, they're just usually really busy.   Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"For carrying fresh and authentic zeppole, sfogliatella and cannolis this place deserves kudos.  I have to usually travel far for these things but now I have a place i the city to grab and impress someone.  The prices are totally reasonable too.  Did I tell you that zeppole is freshly made each time? Fresh custard on choux pastry.  Heaven!"}
{"text":"I have tried to understand time and time again what the big deal about this place is. Have visited several times and still just don't get it.  The service is bad, the food is just ok. It must be the patio then."}
{"text":"What I've come to expect from a good Italian bakery/cafe is the selection and assortment of said baked goods coupled with delicious Italian pressed coffee. That's sort of what I received here. The pastries I was really looking forward to, were very limited, so I wasn't that impressed.   First off, the sweets weren't on display, everything is ordered off a menu. This would be fine, if only they didn't tell you to ask the waitress about the pastries written on the menu. Often times, people don't know what some particular pastries are called or even look like, so the display, in my opinion, is important. Unfortunately, they only had three cakes in the window, which were also the only ones available. In addition to perhaps a handful of other things, it was disappointing from what I'm used to and prefer.   They have crepes and waffles- but I gotta say, I'm personally not really going to an Italian Cafe for things I can get at any dessert place. If you are, it's here and they look good. They have ice cream too, I give them that.  I ordered two different types of cannoli which I think are a staple dessert in a cafe like this. They were fair sized, tasted good, but the consistency of cream was a bit too runny and soft for both the pistachio and original chocolate chip. Not like the denser, creamier whipped mascarpone you would expect in a great cannoli, really.  The latte and iced tea were fine, nothing different, great or fancy.  Overall, I'd choose another cafe in this area of Little Italy, personally. There are several alternatives around which have more selection, fresh baked breads and pastries. I was really tempted to walk 2 minutes east for something more."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday after work. The place was practically empty given the time of day. I ordered a waffle with Ice cream. Without a doubt the best waffle I have ever had. Ice cream certainly be better, but it isn't half bad.   The serving was huge so make sure you go hungry, staff is friendly and the place is clean. Whta more do you want!"}
{"text":"Odd service but good snacks,coffee and food! The place is roomy. They are a little in need for a re-decorating but otherwise I will continue going back there, it's very well located and I've been happy with what I ordered, every time. I really enjoyed my cannoli."}
{"text":"Good location, nice patio, and the food is all well priced and pretty tasty.   Im a fan of the breakfast options, and the orange juice they serve is delicious and a good sized serving versus the mini glasses found at some places. The gelato is alright, but there are a few places within a block radius that are better.  The patio is good size with options both on College and the side street it sits on the corner of, but I agree with the other reviews on here... The major problem with this place is the service, or lack there of. They always seem understaffed. I've been there numerous times on the weekend when only one person is running between all the tables inside and on the patio outside.   The service almost makes me want to give the place 2 stars but its only been an actual issue a couple of times, and I continue to come back so it must be A-OK afterall."}
{"text":"C and I had last been here in 2001. At that time they served a pastry called \"phantom cake.\" It was so memorable that we searched for this place. Sadly, the current staff had never heard of it. So we munched on canoli's and enjoyed espressos and coffees.   Service: 3 star Ambiance: 3 stars Cuisine: 4 stars"}
{"text":"The Sicilian Sidewalk Café is a bit of a fancier coffee/desert spot.  They serve coffees and espresso drinks, as well as waffles, cakes and other good deserts.  It's not the kind of place where you come and grab something to go.    If you come here, you come to sit and enjoy.  With that in mind, there's instantly a bit of a different atmosphere to this place.  Most coffee shops are small and homey or a cookie cutter and sterile.  Instead, here you find a place that is much more like a restaurant.  In authentic Italian style, the espresso drinks (such as Americanos) are smaller than you might be used to, but make up for it in quality.  Another good coffee drink (the name of which escapes me right now...) takes a coffee, but adds a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the mix.  If you're worried about the cold coffee, maybe order one between friends and you can each try it out."}
{"text":"Im a big fan of cappuccino but it's hard to find a good cappuccino with real mousse. I highly recommend here. I ate tiramisu but i didn't like it. I couldn't find a real italian taste. Cappuccino is 5/5 but tiramisu is 2/5"}
{"text":"This place used to be very busy for many years but I believe has lost customers over the past years however, I hope that this place gets back too its prime as it is simply amazing for dessert. They make the freshest crepes and waffles - Try the Tutto Noce!! 5/5!"}
{"text":"A great way to end the night in the heart of little Italy.  The big patio is definitely an attraction on a summer night.  This place is happening, with a vast menu of desserts, and cafes available, this place screams for sweet tooths, and caffeine with the option of alcohol!  My date had an americano, while I had a cappuccino along with their waffles!! The service was helpful, choices, and prices were reasonable, however for a first time visit, ill need to come back and spend a bit MORE time here."}
{"text":"Waaiiitt hold up.. no one has reviewed this place yet? Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe is probably THE dessert/cafe place in Little Italy. Most people I talk to and mention cafe in Little Italy instantly have an image of this place.  They have a load of fresh cakes and gourmet pastries (including mouth watering waffles and rolled up crepes) and they consistently amaze me with their rich taste. This is definitely a place worth checking out if you're in Little Italy and looking for an espresso with a sweet treat."}
{"text":"I'm changing my original review. The service is so bad here that after 10 minutes, I did not get so much as a hello.  I actually walked out ahead of a server who had nothing at all to say."}
{"text":"Inside this cafe is very cold and not cozy at all. It isn't so welcoming. We had waffles and the tiramisu delight. The waffle was fresh and yummy but the tiramisu light were very very bad. It didn't taste like tiramisu, not even close. The coffee is also not good, it tastes like water."}
{"text":"Several weeks ago, I finally decided to venture here after seeing the delicious looking pics on the page for this cafe. I was not disappointed by the experience. Having recently become a big waffle fanatic, the two ice-cream flavors on my Tutto Noce waffle held their shape for quite awhile and if they did start to melt, did it at a leisurely pace. Both flavors were also tasty even though I prefered the hazelnut flavored Nocciola. The waffle was also firm enough that it did not soften too quickly under the liquid weight of the frozen creams. I also had a Rocca Noce blended frozen cocktail and I could taste the distinctiveness of the Frangelico through all that creamy sweetness of the irish cream de cocoa, the nocciola ice-cream and the whipped cream topping.  I will definitely be back again in the warmer months to satisfy another Italian-style waffle and ice-cream craving :-)"}
{"text":"Good gelato. We got pistachio, mint choc chip, tiramisu and banana. The banana was a little artificial tasting (if you want the best, go across the street to Dolce Gelato), but still good, but the tiramisu was awesommmme!  Nice friendly service by the young guy in there."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I came here almost a decade ago, and thought it was such a wonderous little place. Time hasn't been kind to this Little Italy dessert stop. The cannoli (original flavour) and gelato (baci and banana flavours) were both just ok. The waffle was a bit limp, though the sprinkling of nuts and spread of nutella were pretty generous. Service was also slow despite the fact that there were hardly any other patrons there. Sad to see a once lovely place seem so mediocre."}
{"text":"Dessert is solid here. Crepe, Waffle, Tartufo, etc.... Get some ice cream. Try the coffee and zabajone flavours. Zabajone is wine and egg nog. It sounds weird, but trust me it's good.  The service is taking a beating in these reviews, but mainly it's because they're busy. At peak times just be a bit more aggressive about getting their attention and you'll be fine.   Service is friendly, but it's just slow when there are lots of patrons. They have a laid back vibe. To some degree, that's part of the territory.  The patio is also in a perfect location on College, on a bend in the road, so you can see a long way off."}
{"text":"Come for the cannoli and not for the bruschetta.  On a rainy Saturday, there was plenty of tables available in the afternoon. The desserts looked delicious so we ordered the original and hazelnut cannoli and since we wanted something salty to go with it, we also ordered the bruschetta.  The bruschetta were disappointing. It tasted like a mild chunky salsa over toast. It looked nice, but I could have made that taste better for a cheaper price.  The cannoli were delicious and pretty big. The original was good but I really liked the hazelnut spread in the hazelnut cannoli.  Overall, the service was patient and friendly, the cannoli were delicious, but the bruschetta was a real bummer. If I ever return, I would want to try their crepes because they looked"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!! Okay, not so hidden, but I've been walking past this place for years with zero desire to go in, but was looking for cannoli a few days ago and Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe came up in my search.  I went on a Sunday for lunch with my parents -- we ordered a couple different panini (veal, grilled veggie, and spicy sopressata) and they were all excellent and so cheap considering the quality and the neighborhood. Coffee was just okay. As for the cannoli, they are made fresh to order and definitely taste like it!! So many other tempting desserts and gelato flavors too....   Service-wise, staff was very friendly but this probably isn't the best place if you're in a really big rush (which I wasn't). Alternatively, I liked that we didn't feel pressured to rush out as soon as we finished our meal. I can def see myself returning here a lot, especially when the patio is open as the decor inside is pretty dated (which is probably why it took me so long to finally eat here -- I judge books by their covers a lot)."}
{"text":"When I was much younger I used to often go to this spot because I felt that it was a legitimate cultural experience.   It made me feel exotic.  All fancy and sophisticated.... mainly because the name didn't rhyme with Boffee Bime.   Of course,  I had never really figured that real Italian culture had nothing to do with generic ice cream slopped over fat batter waffles.      There is a nice patio though.  If by \"nice\" you mean \"you can sit outside\"."}
{"text":"Came here the other night to show my cousin Little Italy in Toronto. The service was actually quite good this time and there was no freezer burn in my ice cream. This place will remain my 'go to' stop when in Little Italy."}
{"text":"This place still does and always will have a place in my heart. That being said, I'm much too patient for my own good. Service does suck, but if you can wait it out or are in a group that doesn't mind waiting around and just talking the ice cream and drinks are quite delicious.   Have gone here about 5 or 6 times now. Very slow to greet, but talking with others made that ALMOST forgivable. Almost. After finally getting service I almost always have the Meccanotte Waffle and a Mafioso (vodka poured over lemon ice). Honestly that drink, to me, makes the place worth it. The waffle is delicious, combining flavors amazingly, with delicious sauces and ice creams. And the lemon ice is to die for. Waiters did take a long time to take plates away, and even when they did, it took about 30 to 45 minutes between the time they cleared our table and the time they gave us our bill.   Overall, 3 stars is the most I can give it, mostly because the service is just so terrible. I would also recommend going during the annual \"Taste of Little Italy\". You get live music and entertainment while waiting for the waitress to serve you :)"}
{"text":"I came here with two of my friends to eat desserts and avoid the cold(it was 10 p.m. on Friday night)  Food:  We ordered different variations of ice cream + whipped cream + drizzled sauce. I ordered chocolate ice cream with whipped cream drizzled in caramel sauce. What I found interesting was that the chocolate ice cream was covered with a thin layer of chocolate. It was delicious!!  Just the right amount of sweets to end the night!  Service: A friendly young lady took our order and gave us our order. The only thing that she was not able to do was split the bill (due to large crowds coming in after World Cup matches).   Atmosphere:  It was warm and cozy- the lighting was dimmed, so that people can enjoy food and talk. Although it was really crowded that day, we still had a good time.  I would visit here again to try other items!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and coffee here. That being said I had to write this review based off of the poor customer service  at this cafe.   It is truly a mess, it is so frustrating to want to love a place that does have good quality dessert and coffee and that is open late! But it's like they lack basic knowledge of how to treat their customers!   Every time I come here, busy (which I would understand) or dead, whoever the waiter/waitress is takes forever. They drop the menus on the table, don't even greet you and walk away immediately from the table, you literally can't even get a drink order in! They act as if they are doing YOU a favor.. they don't even come in and check up on you. Also always takes forever to order the bill. I don't even understand.   I love this place. I just wish they would seriously work on their lack of customer service. Not a good or welcoming feeling walking into a business you'd like to enjoy and feeling like you are unwanted."}
{"text":"This is another excellent patio for people watching in Little Italy. Open quite late.  They serve all sorts of coffees, ice creams, plus ice cream and coffee combinations. YUM.   The waffles are flippin huge and come topped with mounds of ice cream. Good for sharing. Nor can you go wrong with the nutella crepe topped with hazelnuts.   Service can sometimes be a tad slow, but nothing too unreasonable."}
{"text":"I got the pazza I just really wanted a crepes no ice cream but didn't have it on the menu but it was still good. My bf had sorbet he didn't like it very much and parking was nearly impossible on Saturday night"}
{"text":"This place is great for after-dinner dessert with friends or watching the World Cup on their big screen tv outside! Sometimes they're understaffed, however, so the service can be touch-and-go. Nevertheless, the waffles, crepes, tartufo, and cassata frequently feature in my dreams at night, but most worthy of honourable mention are their cannoli!! They're huge, filled with sweetened ricotta and chocolate chips, freshly made, and are by far the best I've tasted!"}
{"text":"Oh, the enjoyment I have experienced on this patio!  If dessert is ever on my mind (which, to be honest, it usually isn't, but sandwiches usually are, and they have those too), this place usually follows as the answer.  The crepes are giant (as big as my arm- we measured one time), and the waffles even more so. But the real secret, I think, to the particular deliciousness that hides in these walls is: the ice cream. Their own special brand that is made on site (at the adjacent Sicilian Ice Cream Company), it really stands out as being the main feature of all the dishes they put it in. My favourite is the Zabajone, which they once described to me as vanilla with a kind of eggnog flavour. Oh mercy, how I love it.  Anyway, they also have a pretty long list of  breakfast foods, and a good choice of sandwiches. They are very tasty, but I would prefer it if they came with something on the side- other than the olives which, don't get me wrong, I love-- cuz they're not exactly huge (as my arm, of course). It's a fun place to sit and have a long conversation because you think you're just going to have a sandwich...then you have a San Pellegrino, then you split a crepe, then you have some coffee..."}
{"text":"So worth the drive from Mississauga.  Understaffed at times but their friendly and apologetic. Great ambience, great selection and lots to choose from"}
{"text":"I always IN for sweet and staying out late on a Saturday night!   After having Japanese sushi, we looking for a place for a night Cap and my date suggested going to Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe for some crepes! She really knows how I roll!   Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe is not one of those girly Cafe... Nothing Girly with Leaf's Game showing on TV (aside from the Leaf's being girly and they suck big time..?? that's a different story!)   Freshly made Crepes/Waffles seems to be the most popular thing on the menu... So we decided to share a ice cream crepes... that was so yummy... but the tiramisu was one of the worst  and the driest one I ever have!   SKIP the cake!! Order anything else but that!!  I have to give credit for Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe to stay open till 3 AM on Friday and Saturday night... What's better to have one of those crepes after a whole night of drinking?"}
{"text":"This is my default place to come for dessert if I happen be in the area.  The gelato ice cream is excellent and the choices are pretty good."}
{"text":"Everyone else has summed up why this place is awesome, but I do have one tip that will make your life better -- they have freezers inside filled with delicious Italian ice cream you can bring home with you! And individually wrapped Tartufo in a bunch of yummy flavours. Stock up and fill your freezer with them during the summer, or serve them to guests and pretend you made them. Sooooo good!"}
