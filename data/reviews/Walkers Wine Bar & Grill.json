{"text":"Decent food although somewhat pricey for the quality. Service was poor as waitress forgot multiple ordered items etc. I'd go there again if I was in the area and really wanted some seafood."}
{"text":"Great intimate place, personable service and food is splendid.  Have to have the oysters."}
{"text":"Great selection of seafood choices and not too pricy. Our server / bartender, Aidan, was very professional, friendly, and helpful. Brought two of my girl friends here, once for lunch and once for dinner. Was quite busy but was always attended to. The girls loved the place; and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing experience with European draft beers, home made sauces, Italian prosecco and amazing sea bass..."}
{"text":"I brought my family to Walker's for my mom's birthday.  We usually go to Snug Harbour in Port Credit, but I feel like that has gone downhill over the last few years, but their prices have stayed the same or gone up!  Pleasantly pleased to find this restaurant after reading about it on Yelp under the \"People Who Viewed This Also Viewed..\" section.  Great, warm atmosphere.  My family commented multiple times about the fans in the middle of the room.  The serving sizes are big and everything tastes extremely fresh, which is a definite plus at a seafood restaurant.  It was also really nice that I didn't have to yell to talk to the people around me.  A nice place to be with friends and family.  I had the lobster and shrimp bisque for a starter and the grilled barramundi for my entree.  The bisque was quite tasty with a decent amount of meat morsels.  Only criticism is that it was a tad on the salty side... though that didn't stop me from finishing the whole bowl!  The barramundi was soft and flaky and delicious.  It came with asparagus, carrots and fingerling potatoes.  A perfect Sunday night dinner.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences we've ever had at a restaurant when we visited for a lunch outing with a friend this Sunday, Dec 16,2012. We arrived to an empty restaurant with one one girl at the front that told us to pick any place to sit. The once pristine cream coloured upholstery were stained with dark splotches and that went for every piece of seating there. While dead insects lined the window sill by where my wife sat. We had barely sat down, when the waiter showed up asking us for or drink orders we asked for 3 waters. The waters arrived almost 10 minutes later. Two out of our three glasses were unwashed and had things floating in them. One had a piece of hair in it, where another had lots of food particles from a previous dish wash or customer. We finally flagged the waiter down and he agreed on changing the waters. In between this mess, we put our orders in; Blackened fish tacos, Crab and Shrimp Melt, English Muffin breakfast crab cakes (the waiter verbally took down our orders without writing them down ). He returned twenty minutes later (keep in mind apart from us there were maybe four other customers in this large restaurant) the result? Both glasses of water still had particles floating in them! Disgusted we put our waters aside and waited for our orders. Red flag number one. Fourty five minutes later, the waiter arrived with a female manager. Out of our three orders they only got one right; the English breakfast crab cakes. However, the hollandaise sauce had already congealed, while the accompanied fruits were brown, and stale! Yuck!  As for the other two dishes,  the waiter arrived with shrimp tacos instead of our blackened fish tacos and shrimp melt! We told them about the mistake, but both manager and waiter looked confused - almost as if they had no idea if those items were even on the menu. Red flag number two. The manager and the waiter scurried away into the kitchen and then reappeared with those same shrimp tacos they brought to our table and tried to pass them onto two customers who were seated behind us. They immediately caught on after hearing the debacle from our table, and also complained about the doucing of hoisin sauce on their dishes which they didn't ask for.  We had heard enough!but Red flag number three. We immediately got up and told the waiter that we were leaving, hoping to hear an apology from him about their horrible service. Except all we heard was \"Okay.\" We left hungry and disgruntled, looking to spend our money at a more well deserved establishment. Avoid this sham of a restaurant, which has obviously taken on discourteous staff and management with absolutely no knowledge of customer service or restaurant etiquette."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Great selection of fish, oysters etc, extensive wine list, nice ambiance and reasonable staff. The prices are a bit on the high side but you get a good meal for the money. This is one of the better restaraunts I've been to in a while. They have a nice patio too. Oysters are free from 4 to 6 in the bar on Thursdays ..."}
{"text":"To make it short and precise, bad food, bad service and rip-off price. Not worth anything and won't go back."}
{"text":"The food is decent here, but tonight we felt kind of ignored, everything took a long time, even drinks, and raw oysters despite there only being 6 tables.  Also the 3 people working FOH, (2 servers, 1 bartender )were so clumsy,  each one broke something or dropped a tray of dishes or glasses.  And then the table next to us broke a glass and had to flag someone down to clean it up since no one was tending to our section for so long."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. So soft and moist and a very generous portion of fries. Reasonable prices. The decor is nice and its great for a date night as its on the quiet side as well. I have also gotten take out here as well and 2 pieces of fish and chips came to under 20 bucks. Definitely recomend this place to any fish and chip lovers out there! (and wine lovers of course)"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, pleasant service, great menu selection. I had quite a great experience at Walkers, not the cheapest but definitely worth it to treat yourself  once in a while. Their smoked salmon was on point!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and decided to try the restaurant. We had the lobster bisque with the beetroot arugula salad and the surf n turf meal.  The bisque was a bit extra salty but nice flavours and texture. The salad was very good. Nice goat cheese and toasted pine nuts added the extra flavours.   The steak and lobster tail was very good and cooked to perfection. I found the potatoes to be a bit too much and can be compensated with some other grilled vegetable options.   Great service and excellent 2014 Cab Sauvignon red - recommended by our server.  Overall great experience and nice ambience."}
{"text":"I would never go here for most types of seafood, but we wanted fish & chips as they are hard to mess up. We had a friendly greeting and a friendly server, but it seemed like she had too many tables to keep up.  Our food was hot, and the fish and fries were tasty. But the coleslaw - if you can call it that - looked like it'd been around a few too many weeks and had zero dressing. The carrot pieces were so dry they looked like rubber. We waited and waited for the server to get some coleslaw WITH dressing. She finally appeared and said she'd check with the kitchen. We thought this meant we would get coleslaw WITH dressing. No. By then we were mostly done our food and we are done with the place. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"We went there with a Groupon. The staff are nice, the place is very relaxing. All the food we ordered are very good. Sampler appetizer, lobster bisque, mac and cheese, burger and shrimp tacos. I've read a lot of complains about being pricey. The prices is what you can see in their online menu so they shouldn't be surprise about it.  What i dont expect is that they included 15% gratuities right away, i would have given it anyway as my choice."}
{"text":"The staff was not really warm and welcoming although my son made reservations for a birthday lunch cake was stale and  chowder has pork in it  ."}
{"text":"Food is below par. We got the king crab bucket and the stuffed salmon.  Crab was extremely salty and not fresh at all. Salmon was bland and nothing worth talking about. Even the pizza from the kids menu was not properly cooked. On top of it, the waitress was inexperienced and seemed like she belonged in a preschool classroom. The 2 stars rating is for the restaurant being very nicely decorated and the friendly hostess."}
{"text":"I went on November 7th with my fiance, this was the second time I had been there:  PROS - Atmosphere was lovely, not busy, and decor is very cute and clean looking - Food was tasty (oysters, calamari)  CONS - Staff were running around trying to set up for dinner (we were there at 4:30) - Staff never came up to us and ask how everything was, I waited to order a second drink throughout the entire time eating so I didnt order and they lost an extra $12 there. - While staff was setting up for dinner( which in my opinion should be earlier than 4:30) she reached across our table with her hair hanging over our food while we were eating. I do think she should have waiting until we were done..found it really rude. - Expensive for what it was.  FINAL OUTCOME: I would probably order takeout but I dont think I would go back, for the price everything was, I would have expected a better staffing experience. Ive received better service at Jack Astors."}
{"text":"Great place! The interior decoration is upscale and classy, they have great portions for lunch and they have very friendly wait staff!  Went here for lunch and the prices are reasonable.  Had the coconut curry mussels which came with bread.  Delicious! great portion as well, enough to let someone taste some, without feeling as if you didn't have a full lunch.  Also tasted the cod and chips which was $16.95 for two pieces.  There was a lot of batter so I'd give that a 3.5 stars.  The chips/fries was awesome though because they were homestyle cut fries.  Overall, great experience for lunch.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"All Seafood Markets considered, Walkers Fish Market does just fine the way they are. All elements exist, ambiance, service, smooth SAILING aye aye Captain theme. Perfect for nearby Oakville peeps with their fancy schmancy sailing floating machinery.  It's comfy classy place to be and is different enough feel than other Seafood restos. It doesn't hurt that most seating areas can see the bar-area LCD, sweetsa.   3.5'd Since it's a Seafood resto 1st, Steak 2nd, you may see their products/menus change.  All very safe no surprise what-you-expect-from-a-place-like-this kind of Food. I remember I looked at this place for some Gumbo but didn't order it at the time. I think they've changed their soup selection since then.    : (  Oyster Samplers (large/$18.95)      - Apalachicola, Raspberry Point, Beausoleil and Blue Point Oysters(2 each) Peel and Eat Shrimp and Crawfish ($11.95)  Banana Bread Pudding ($7.95)"}
{"text":"Will start off by saying the food was excellent. We were a party of 10 and everyone enjoyed the food with a wide variety, from the beet salad to pasta to the sea bass. The same cannot be said for the experience. We had a reservation so the table was prepared when we came in, the hostess pointed the table to us and didn't actually seat us. The waitress came quickly over and rushed the entire evening, we had to call her back a couple of times as she was already walking away before people finished their orders. We went on New Year's Day in the evening, so understood that they were closing early, however, that was only communicated when we were given the bill. If you do happen to go, request a table in the quieter area by the fireplace. Our table was near the washroom so we could hear more than we would have liked."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood platter and was very disappointed.  The Atlantic king crab was not fresh at all and lobster was overlooked (had to pay extra $22.95 for lobster.  The shrimp was also overdone and rubbery.    The lobster bisque appetizers were more like a lobster broth and tasted almost like it was out of a can.  Bread was served cold with non-spreadable butter.    The 5 oysters were the only thing they didn't mess up.   Total price for 2 was $170, including only 2 glasses of wine.   Fine dining price with a much less than fine dining experience.  Will never return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice decor. It looks like a Red Lobster for adults only. I love the food. We will be back."}
{"text":"A nice place for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I liked their sign when I came in, today's soup is wine. What's not to love about a place like this.  BB"}
{"text":"Came to Walkers during the holidays for a company lunch. We were given a 3-course fixed menu to select from.  Environment:  Upon walking into the restaurant I noticed that the place was very quiet. Other than the private room that my company booked, there weren't tables out there with customers, even though the restaurant clearly has capacity for a lot more people...not sure if this suggests anything, but definitely an unusual scene during the holiday season. Our department secretary booked this restaurant because they offer a private room for big groups. We came with around 20-25 people and clearly the room could barely contain this many people. We had 2 long tables and it was very crowded. It was nearly impossible for the people on the side with the backs of the chairs facing to not collide with the other side when someone has to get up.   Food: Apparently Walkers has their own private label red wine and white wine. We got both to try, but since I didn't I'm not sure if it actually tasted good, but I didn't hear any complains from my colleagues either. I had their grapefruit juice and it was pretty good.  I had the clam chowder to start and I would say it's better than the chowder at most places. The soup was really creamy and flavourful and there was a good amount of clams in there. But this is where the praises end.  I got the lobster stuffed salmon with mango sauce for main course and it tasted so weird that I had to force myself to finish it. The sour mango sauce didn't really go well with the salmon in my opinion and the salmon itself wasn't cooked nicely as it tasted mushy and bland. The other who had the steak said their dish was pretty good, so I guess I just didn't make the right choice. For dessert I got the chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream. I found the fudge to be just alright, but the vanilla ice cream was amazing. It had a really strong vanilla bean flavour which was definitely distinguishable from the average supermarket stuff.  Service: Service was pretty good when the waitresses were around. However, they didn't stay around our private room when they weren't taking orders/serving/clearing plates, and I don't think there was a bell in the room to call them over, so that was annoying."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and the people serving us were as well. The only only issue was the 1 hour wait just for our appetizer (nachos)."}
{"text":"So that's what that place is like! Having driven by this location on Dundas near Winston Churchill many times, (which has changed hands a few times from the original Tony Romas of many years ago), I decided to give it a try. This is primarily a seafood restaurant with a wide variety of dishes. We had the seafood tower which features prawns, smoked salmon, mussels and clams. However, at $46, it should have also had some scallops and crab.   The space is very large with the elevated dining area next to the bar being used the most, at least when we were there. The bar was comfortable enough with a good number of booths and the service was great. It is a nice place for a drinks and some appetizers at the bar. The service was good and the bread rolls are hot and fresh, however you have to ask for those."}
{"text":"beautiful interior....good weeknight specials on apps! however,  the hostess offered us the \"happy hours\" specials menu on a sunday night (9pm-close) since we arrived after 9pm...not applicable so that was a little misleading. ...in any case, we ordered some apps & oysters (we came for the oysters)  oysters - delicious! good choice of oysters & sauces.  garlic mushroom bread - good, different. a bit hard to bite into but tasty like bread at an italian restaurant with mushrooms & pesto added ( a few slices should be complimentary for the table)  dynamite shrimp - AMAZING!!!! perfect blend of sweet & spicy. get these!  crab cakes - bland. waste of good crab meat. don't bother  calamari - good with the thai sauce    banana bread pudding - enough to share! order it bc it is divine:-)    pet peeve & service complaints- manager & 3 servers lounging around doing nothing while our server (& the hostess) was rushing around serving tables in the bar & dining areas! that's pretty ridiculous!! and when the hostess got off shift, she sat at the bar eating & socializing with the other staff lounging around...there should be a separate area specified for the staff...a star lost there for sure.... however, our server Phil, was awesome (when we could actually get the poor man over to us)...he was even the one who shucked the oysters & made great suggestions!!   all in all, worth a trip back but definitely some points lost...."}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday evening. First time visit. 2 appetizers: Mussels and Calamari Main: Chicken and Shrimp Curry Main: Clam Chowder  Prices are reasonable. Bread was fresh and soo delicious. Fav were the mussels and calmari. Clam chowder were very good. Chicken and Shrimp curry was a bit dry but the spice level was perfect.  Service was excellent. Great atmosphere.  Will return!"}
{"text":"I was there with a friend on Friday, Oct 2, 2015 at approx 8 pm. It was very quiet for a Friday night and we soon figured out why. The service is terrible and impersonal bordering on some staff being rude/impatient even when there are so few diners!  By the way, we has made a reservation but it really wasn't necessary.   My friend had been there before and remembered the fish being very good. The main waitress came to get our orders and than without apology said the fish I wanted was not available (rainbow trout). She suggested the special catch of the day which was significantly more expensive at $41-43! So I went with the snapper prepared \"dirty\". My friend also got fish - the salmon prepared dirty too. It was a bit spicy for him but I enjoyed the subtle kick.   We has to ask for salt & pepper shakers, & for our water to be topped up, for extra lemon slices for calamari & our water, etc. Overall just a lack of attentiveness or making the diner feel special and valued. A lack of general friendliness.   The fried calamari was standard with a standard dipping sauce. Nothing special and no option of grilled calamari unfortunately.   Our fish dishes were also okay....they weren't exceptional but they weren't terrible either. Nothing wow'd me about this place.   Our bill for 2 with 1 app, 2 mains, &  1 5 oz glass of wine came to around $85-90 + tip.  My friend was so agitated from his work day + the lack of attentiveness by the service staff that we decided not to stay for tea/coffee!   Could not wait to get out of there. Not impressed and rather spend my money elsewhere.   By the way the decor is very cool with the nautical theme and the booth was comfortable. But there was no buzz for a Friday night which made the experience less like a Friday night."}
{"text":"Went here with three others last night. Requested a table near the fireplace which also happened to be beside the small staircase. Our waiter (older gentleman) kept leaning over the staircase to pick up cutlery and glassware AND he served our food this way to the two people closest to the staircase. The food was just O.K.  The calamari was good. The red pepper soup was good. But the Caesar Salad and the Diavolo Linguine were terrible. Have been to this restaurant a few times previously as it's a lovely setting but the food and service last night were disappointing. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We've been visiting Walkers wine bar and grill for several years. They came under new ownership a year or so ago and I have to say the quality has gone downhill since then.   Last night I visited with my husband and son. We had purchased a Wagjag coupon for oysters and 2 glasses of wine, so we decided to make an evening of it.  We were approached as soon as we walked in to the restaurant and seated right away by a friendly hostess (she appeared to do more than just hostess, so maybe a manager).  Our waitress approached us right away and as soon as I mentioned the Wagjag, she went to get our wine and oysters. The waitress was very friendly and efficient. We also ordered calamari, which she brought quite quickly.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and the wine, which was a house pinot grigio was very nice. The calamari was very good and served with a sweet chili sauce. Our only complaint about this course is that the sauces served with the oysters were all fairly sweet. We would have liked some freshly grated horseradish (instead of a seafood sauce) and some sort of hot sauce. Otherwise, this whole course was great.  For entrée, I ordered grilled snapper which came with veggies (peppers and asparagus) and a gratin potato (sort of a patty). The snapper was very overcooked and dry. The veggies were crisp and fresh and the potato was delicious. The snapper had an orange sauce which was quite tasty. Unfortunately the snapper ruined the dish as it really was quite bad.  My husband ordered the surf and turf which was a lobster tail (1/2 lb.) with an 8 oz. NY strip and veggies and potatoes. The steak was blue rare as ordered, but the lobster tail was overcooked and rubbery. The veggies and potatoes were both very good.  Our son had the surf and turf burger without a bun and with the lobster on the side (he's allergic, so that was for us to enjoy). The shredded lobster served on the side was quite good, moist and tasty. The burger was very dry, but the fries were (according to our son) the best ever.   I'd like to give this restaurant 2.5 stars, but that's not possible so I'm rounding down. I feel that since this is a seafood restaurant, the thing that should be outstanding is the fish and seafood and other than the oysters, this is what let us down.   We purchased 2 Wagjag vouchers, so we will definitely be visiting again and I will update my review if we have a better experience next time.  The waitress was excellent, so there's definitely no complaint there. She also removed the calamari from our bill to help compensate for the overcooked fish and lobster.  On another note, when we used to visit, they allowed us to bring our own wine with free corkage on Sundays. Shortly after the new owners took over, we brought our own wine (unaware there had been a change in ownership) and were told that \"we'll allow it this time, but will charge you $15. In the future it will be more expensive.\""}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a touch of nautical themed elements.  The ambience was very good. Excellent service. Came here for a party and the staff were great and very accommodating. Lots of selections on the menu. They made selecting a menu for a private function very flexible and had vegetarian options available as well. The steak was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't try any of the seafood to be honest. Dessert on the other hand was a bit sad. Would definitely return to try the seafood as that's what they're known for. Overall,  a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This location is relatively new, but they also have a place in Burlington which I've tried a few years back.    My biggest complaint is that there aren't many pasta options here.  But they do have mussels, and good fish selection.  I ordered fish and chips, and my gf got the jambalaya, both which were really good.    The escargot is not as good as The Keg, too cheesy, not buttery/garlicy enough for me.  The jerk shrimp was good too.  Service was attentive, asked us if we needed anything plenty of times.    Not a fancy fine dining atmosphere, but still a nice upscale place.    Derek"}
{"text":"Walkers (fish market) previously is a really cool place, very quite and nice ambiance, with a breath-taking patio area. Their menu selections is great and have wide selections for all tastes. My all time favourite item is the Lobster Nachos! It is worth the 45 minutes drive to this place just for that! They also have a private party room, that can fit about 25 ppl which is great for corporate or small private functions. Service is great, staff is very friendly and professional. It's usually not too busy, but they have a busy hour or two around early dinner time, the rest should be quite, which works out well since the atmosphere is perfect for a glass of wine and a good quite meal.  My only intake on Walkers since the first time I had visited, is that the decoration, cutlery, glasses, setup, everything about this place screams more on the fine dining edge, however on the other hand, you'll get the food served in baskets sitting on a piece of wax paper! They should DEFINITELY change their food presentation, it will fit much better with the premium prices and beautiful decor/setup."}
{"text":"Walkers Fishmarket and Hockey Playoffs?   I never know that I will be watching a playoff game in a Seafood restaurant... Nice Ambiance... and with 3 TVs showing different games..... with no volume or caption though...but it is not really a sport bar.   Fresh Oysters, Fish, Shrimp and Steak and even Chicken...? so everyone will find something they like... (but seriously who is coming to a Fishmarket for chicken... probably he/she got drag here unwillingly!)   Oyster Samplers ($18.95) Large with 2 of each today selection  - Apalachicola, Raspberry Point, Beausoleil and Blue Point Oysters were offered  - Shucked by our lovely waitress... they kept them iced at the side of the bar area  - Served with cocktail sauce, fresh horseradish, hot sauce or a garlicky sauce.. or if you prefer freshness just like me, a drizzle of fresh lemon juice would have do the trick   Peel and Eat Shrimp and Crawfish ($11.95)  - good fingering food to go with the beer and watching hockey game..much healthier than eating Nachos  - Funny thing is the seasonings they used tasted like celery, combined that with Louisiana sauce marinated reminded my friend of Bloody Caesar.. I love Bloody Caesar but I rather drinking it!   Banana Bread Pudding ($7.95)  - highly recommended by our waitress  - I found it just way too doughy, heavy and hard, we cannot even finish that.. and you know how my friend just hate to waste food.. and it was just that bad!  - I am glad there was no raisins being harmed in making this dessert though...  - BTW there are Banana Bread Pudding that are made with RAISINS!   Services was excellent! Waitress was so nice and friendly... and we have so much fun, at least I had.. I hope my friend was not embrassed when I was clapping my hands when my team scored!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to try out this place. We  went on a Saturday lunch and we were the first customers. For a lunch menu, it was quite pricey. It looked more like a dinner menu.   The decor had the ambiance of being near the seashore. Oldie music played in the background. There were lots of wooden ships as decor which made me look around and admire the place.   For only having 2 tables into lunch hour, service was decent. But we did have to wait awhile for our food. We wondered why.   Me: I had the cod fish and chips. I ordered 2 which looked bigger than expected but eating the fish, it was a disappointment that the batter was thick!! The French fries was alright. Should have asked without salt. The mini kale slaw was good at first but got salty. The tartar sauce was the good part.   My partner: he had the seafood linguini which had a nice smooth tomato sauce. It was packed with mussels and clams, and just a few shrimps on the side. Garnished with pea sprouts (I believe). The waitress didn't give him a bowl for all the shells. We used the side plates. Near the end of his meal, he found a long blonde hair in the sauce. I pulled it out his mouth. (We r Asians so definitely not ours). Not appealing, but we didn't complain.   Verdict: somehow, the tips were included for a party of two. I would have given less due to that incident. Even with the groupon, in total we paid $42 for a lunch which is at a higher end."}
{"text":"Last night on a drive back from the Christie Antique Show we stopped in at Walkers Fish Market on Dundas Street West in Mississauga. We are always happy to find a fish place and was glad to stop in for a dinner on their beautiful patio. Like the rest of the restaurant it is subtly themed in that New England style suggesting a coastal restaurant overlooking the sea. Sadly, the only view is the highway, but with your back to that you can imagine you are somewhere on the coast enjoying delicious fish & seafood.   The restaurant features a selection of fish and seafood appetizers, some fish soups, salads and fresh fish entrees. There is a little bit of everything to please everyone interested in fish and seafood. All the fish can be prepared in four different styles and there are also cold seafood options.  There is also an extensive wine and liquor list to pair with any dining options. Last night we opted for a selection of oysters on the half shell, the smoked salmon appetizer and for dinner, the bouillabaisse, some Pacific inspired salmon and calamari.   The food is always good and the service while languid is always pleasant. The atmosphere is designed for a pleasant summer evening sitting back with friends."}
{"text":"I like the place :) it's romantic and elegant... three muted TV screens, one was showing the WWE Smackdown Holiday yesterday and I was actually staring at throughout dinner haha  The food wasn't expensive here! We had clams (so so fresh) and crab cakes (SO delicious!) for appetizers.   I had the Beer Battered Shrimp, which was a dish with HUGELY battered shrimps and lots of fries (which I didn't finish...) The shrimps were sooooo fat and yummy, I kinda skipped the batter... I just pulled out the shrimp and ate that.  We also had... the Pacific Rim, really fat with lots of veggies. The Stuffed Salmon, I've never seen that before! And one more.. salmon dish, that I forgot. Only I didn't order salmon...  Our waiter that night, Les, was such a gentleman. He's a fun guy, easy to talk to, and makes jokes all the time. I love his enthusiasm. I also saw that the other waitress was friendly too. We got a free dessert because we had a birthday person at our table :)  This was yesterday evening, Tuesday. Reeeally quiet.... Unlimited mussels and fries for $16! Which we didn't get... they have daily specials like that.   Their $149 Seafood Tower (forgot what it's called) is a HUGE tall tower of LOTS of mussels, two lobsters, king crab legs, and etcccc and I totally don't remember hahaha. But it looks REALLY good! Les said he ordered that on his first day of working there and it was ginormous.  Wouldn't mind coming back to try their oysters!"}
