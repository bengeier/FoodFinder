{"text":"how could i give only three stars to a harry potter themed bar as a harry potter fan?  here's the breakdown:   Atmosphere: 4/5- the place is cute and hip with harry potter references sprinkled throughout their decor.  On the evening we went, 90's music predominantly played in the background.  The place is small - so not too great for large groups; it was quite difficult for a group of 4 to secure a table the evening we went!   Service: 3/5 - we wanted to order the chocolate toads however the kitchen had already closed by 11PM.  Our waitress was extremely accommodating and made the extra effort to provide the last cookies and cream toad for us in the end!  The only qualm on service was it appeared to only be one person waiting the tables for the entire bar so it took ages to take our order (a good almost 25 minutes) and another 15 minutes to flag her down for the bill....  Food/ drinks: 2/5 - Chocolate toads (flavours on offer: cookies and cream OR dark chocolate birthday cake)-  we opted for cookies and cream and was disappointed that the toad was just simply a solid piece of white chocolate with oreo bits melted in a chocolate mould.  Given the size (where it is actually only worth 4 small four bites) and what it was made of, it was NOT worth 6 dollars.   - Betterbeer - this is NOT like the butterbeer that you get at universal studios. The drink has a citrus-cinnamon flavour which does not match well with the whipped cream dalloped on top.   It comes with a toasted marshmellow skewer which also did not complement well with the flavours of the drink.  Both my friend and I weren't able to stomach past the first two sips and the drink was left relatively untouched.   I may visit again just because i'm a sucker for gimmicky themed bars and because I want to prank any of my unsuspecting friends with their infamously deadly dementors kiss shot."}
{"text":"I would come back again only if there wasn't such a long line-up to get a table. Considering how much media attention and hype there was for this Harry Potter -themed bar, it was a disappointment for me and my friends (HP non-fans and fan).   We ordered the Deep Fried Jalapeno Mac & Cheese Sliders which were pretty decent (over-priced though). For drinks, we ordered the Befuddlement Draft, which was pretty cool that they lit it on fire and there were flames.  A lot of other people had ordered the Shacklebolt, or Tea for Two, so if I were to come back, I would try those.   I thought they had butterbeer, but they didn't, although they say they might in the future.  The bouncer outside and our waitress were friendly.   Tips: come before 5pm, be first in line so you don't have to wait hours for a table. Or opt for standing only. Don't sit by the window if you don't want the people in line watch you."}
{"text":"Unlike a lot of other poor saps, I didn't have to wait long for a table. Service was mediocre. They were trying a bit too hard. Overall, not a horrible experience. Drinks were gross. The BiG Bad Wolf I ordered (a whiskey drink) tasted like they dumped a half bottle of liquid smoke in it.  Overall, totally hyped up bar. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Upon walking through the doors, The Lockhart had a mysterious vibe to it.  As you walk through the front door, you're met by black curtains which separate the Muggle world of which you are visiting from to the elusive haven to that where magic and wizardry are allowed. (Ok, I'm joking, but it was a nice environment)  Not a Harry Potter fan (friend was), but the experience was great. Like someone else said, the bar was dive-y but it fit the Harry Potter theme very well.  We had the Befuddlement Draft and the River Rocks AKA Black Lake Croquette.   The draft was alright, the experience of getting the drink was more enjoyable than the drink, per se. But all around worth the amount that you pay for it.  The croquette was good too, very rich flavour and well-made.  All in all, would go again!...but only for the feature things they have"}
{"text":"I think that the hype made it seem a lot cooler but the space is still a neat place to check out if you're a fan of Harry Potter. The drinks were so-so and the kitchen wasn't \"working\" (I think the chefs went on strike) so couldn't try any of the food. The bartender was really nice though and met some great people sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"We walked into this brunch spot all willy nilly.   \"we ended up finding the best toast joint in Toronto\" - anonymous  97% sure this place has 100% amazing toast. The toast game is on point. It is truly unparalleled in that it is so buttered. They brought us 5 jams, maybe they made the jams, maybe they didn't, but they were artisan jams and we also had peanut butter too it was an excellent dip.  5 of us had the mexi hash. We all had our eggs poached (this involves cooking the egg in the water without a shell?). Decent hashes, but the toast was really where it was at.  We toasted to the toast many times.   Steve drank two caesars and we had many other various beverages. We soaked up all that liquid with our copious amounts of toast.  The Lockhart is decent. If you do go, get the toast. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Very cool place with welcoming staff. Went to their fundraiser brunch weekend and was impressed with the level of service considering it was free. Great coffee, drinks and the home fries are my new fave. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My experience at the lockhart was OK but generally to be desired. Aftering ubering on over to dundas west for the specific purpose of checking out this bar, within 10 minutes of showing up at 10:15pm on a rainy Friday night, the door guy - a smug looking dude tells my friend and I that unfortunately we won't be making it into the bar this evening... at 10:15, with a line of maybe 15-20 people long. Hype or not, I found this unprofessional given this is a brand new business in Toronto; a city exploding at the seams with hip new bars and novelty restaurants. After all, we were two paying customer willing to wait in the rain to spend money! We decided to wait regardless of what Draco's sidekick said and finally were seated after a 1.5 hour wait. A few main observations: It seems the owners have decided to operate this establishment less like a bar and more like a restaurant because it appeared they only filled the place to seating, and not standing capacity. As a result, the place looked fairly empty despite the line outside. Further, the actual interior is as another reviewer said, fairly nonchalant HP and is really not what I would consider HP themed. Whether this is for copyright reasons or not, Lockhart is getting hype for being an HP themed bar when its quite far from it. The only highlight of the evening was the flaming cauldron drink which looks  cool when it comes out (a $28 bucket of mixed booze with a flaming shot in it) and is fun to ladle into your glass, despite its Rev like flavour. We made our own fun pretending our straws were wands, etc. but the HP ambience was certainly lacking. The only other plus? The slimmer of the two tattoo clad owners, who I would totally request some love potion for."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends who are also Harry Potter fans to celebrate finishing my doctorate. As others have said, the Harry Potter part of it is subtle - probably due to copyright infringement. Don't expect to be immersed in the Three Broomsticks or the Leaky Cauldron but expect to be like, \"Aw, like the potion\" or \"Aw, it's a stag,\" etc.   We got to The Lockhart around 5pm, which was lucky because shortly after we were seated, a very long line began to form outside. The waitress was nice enough to let a couple of my friends who were a bit late join us since we were seated at benches and could squeeze in, but another friend who was even later wasn't able to come in. The two late people had to have their drinks quickly because they needed our table.   This place isn't cozy small, it's just plain small, go with one other person and be prepared to go elsewhere if it's packed; it's good but not worth the wait in the freezing cold for over an hour that people were doing (the owners were kind enough to put a heater outside for people but I don't think it's worth waiting that long). It's also a little difficult to enjoy yourself when you know there is a long line of people staring at you wishing you would hurry the bleep up so they can have their turn to chill.    To the food! We had the popcorn (yummy), baked brie with jam and puff pastry with bread (great), and the mac and cheese sliders (awesome). I split the befuddlement draft with a friend - it wasn't the best tasting drink in the world but the presentation was fun (they set it on fire) and it was served in a fancypants cauldron of the non-leaky variety."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go here! I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, this place was really cool. They decorated it well, the drinks were good and had creative names. The service was very good for being so busy. I didn't try any food but it looked very tasty!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday around 1 pm and thankfully it was pretty empty.  Tried the new brunch, everything was al la carte and We thought that was cool.  Nothing fancy about basic breakfast , but that's all we wanted anyway.  The service was great but place was empty but the staff appreciated the fact they had time to chat and get to know us. It's usually lined up to get in here.    This place fits right in this wonderful neighborhood, didn't see much about Harry Potter but the marketing was genius . Great experience and will drop by some evening to try that experience."}
{"text":"The reason this place was shared so much on social is because of the Harry Potter tie but it was a REALLY loose tie, even if you're trying to be subtle. A lot of the decor was just normal bar decor- thought they would have made everything tie back to HP, even very covertly. Would have been fun if this was the case as you could just look around and try to catch the links. Drinks were really tasty though and if you can, try to make a reservation. Our group of 6 got our table right away as a result but heard others were in line for 2 hrs....overall, since 99% of ppl are coming for the HP theme, I don't think you'll find it 'exceeding expectations'"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to go to, especially if you're a Harry Potter nerd. The decor and names of drinks are all Harry Potter themed. Drinks are strong and delicious! We got The Marauder which came in a pot on a stand shaped like a deer head and then was lit on fire."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome. The place is tiny though. I had fried mac and cheese bites and it was good. The drinks were interesting and tasty (love the Harry Potter puns!). Maybe I'm the only one, but I expected a bit more of a Harry Potter theme. I'd still come back though."}
{"text":"Are you a Harry Potter fan? The drinks here may just befuddle you!  Not known to many, they are open for brunch service on the weekends starting at 10:30AM.   I tried the bread pudding with mascarpone and it was SO GOOD. If you're craving for eggs Benny, they've got that as well.   The staff members are all extremely friendly and helpful in making recommendations. It's not a big place, so the definitely gives off a cozy and homely vibe.   Their menu is constantly changing with the exception of some of their bestsellers. You'll be tempted to try out all the creative concoctions..   You've been warned."}
{"text":"I'll be honest - all of the media hype and attention definitely lured me into this place. I would give it a solid 3.5 stars overall, but given that Yelp doesn't do half-stars, I decided to be generous and round up to 4.   THE GOOD: - We came on a Thursday evening around 7pm, and were immediately able to get seats for 2 at the bar. It's a tiny place - probably seats less than 20 overall - so I would strongly recommend coming early and opting for a 1:1 date instead of a group. I don't think this is a downside, though - it makes the place feel cozy and intimate. An exposed brick wall, neon lights and Harry Potter-inspired decor throughout give The Lockhart a funky and trendy vibe.  - For drinks, I tried the Shacklebolt and the drink special of the day: Basil Expedition. Prices for drinks fell in the $8-10 range, which I'm happy to pay for a good cocktail. The Shackleholt was a concoction of ginger beer, spiced rum and ginger ale - it was spicy and delicious. My Basil Expedition was just like a mojito, but with basil instead of mint. I enjoyed this because it was both sweet and peppery.  - For food, we shared the polenta fries with spicy aioli. To put it simply, I could eat these everyday for the rest of my life and not get sick of them. These are a must-try if you visit.  - Bonus points to the bartender for excellent service and giving us tips on how I could whip up the Basil Expedition at home!   THE BAD: - This point isn't necessarily bad, but just a word of caution: if you're a Harry Potter superfan expecting the HP innuendos and references to jump out everywhere you turn, you're going to be disappointed. I found the references to be subtle overall (e.g., decor included \"Potions & Elixirs\" across the wall and an owl perched in the corner, overlooking the bar). On the flip side, the subtlety of the HP references at The Lockhart make this a great little spot for both fans and non-fans.   I'm really glad we checked out The Lockhart, but to be honest, I wouldn't recommend travelling extensively to come here or waiting hours in line to get in. I think their website sums it up best - \"a rad little joint at the crossroads of Dufferin and Dundas\" - so come early, come for a 1:1 date, and come ready to hunt for those Harry Potter hints."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on Halloween. Had been wanting to visit for a while. While I was hoping it would be more obviously Harry Potter themed, it was really fun anyway. Very small quaint bar. The bartender was super friendly and helpful in explaining all the drinks. Fun, creative drinks and tasty desserts. Would recommend to check out!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant first and foremost-you've got to order food to drink. While they're clearly trying to have fun with the menu and stick to the theme, the execution of the dishes is extremely poor. You're better off sticking with the 6$ poutine or mac n cheese than to order a main dish at $12+. The risotto we tried was severely undercooked-crunchy even, and the \"herbology\" dish was just a plate of French fries with RAW mushrooms on top.   The cocktail menu was slightly better, although again they're sacrificing quality for the sake of playing with the HP theme. I would have rather paid the $10+ per cocktail and had a really good classic drink.   The saving grace was the service-both the server and bartender were very nice! This needs to be a good resto regardless of the theme-they need to go back to the basics. Overall this is an OK spot if you're a diehard Potter fan but otherwise it's not worth the $."}
{"text":"I was there last Friday with a couple of friends. The line was long but it didn't take too long for us to get in. The only thing related to Harry Potter in this place is the name (I was a bit disappointed) but it is a nice place to hang out if you live in the area. I will go back to The Lockhart for the food. The salmon is delicious and the baked brie is just the best baked brie I've ever had! The drinks are really good too and I'm coming back for those. We had the 2 specialty shared cocktails (Befuddlement Draft and Tea for two) and they were really good! Don't waste your time waiting in line though (there are better places to be in line for on a Friday/Saturday night), come back when it's empty."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to come here since it first opened. The betterbeer was fabulous and worth it. Come earlier in the day, as there isn't much seating. So glad I finally came here"}
{"text":"The food is ridiculously overpriced and the size of my hand (and my hands are small, so you get the point). Drinks were good and in tune with HP themes which was cool, still pricey tho. It was hot in there, like I couldn't be in there for more than an hour. I won't be coming back here, I just wanted to see what the fuss was."}
{"text":"This place got a lot of press very fast for being a Harry Potter \"theme\" bar, but if you're walking in there expecting a Universal Studios level of mimicry, you're going to be bummed.  If however, you appreciate clever nods to pop culture and really solid craft cocktails made with incredible skill and attention to detail, you're going to be glad you stopped in.  I came here on a Friday night with a large group - two of whom got there ahead of time and told them a group of 14 was coming by. They were super accommodating - we were told it was standing room only for our group but that was no problem. We came in, ordered drinks and proceeded to have a great night.  The cocktails here take a while, and you should expect no less with cocktails that are crafted by hand with several components. Flavours are complex, and the bar staff are super friendly and will talk to you about in-house made infusions and will make recommendations. I tried three, but my fave was the Rum #2, a spiced rum and coke with burnt orange bitters - delicious.  It was a great experience and I cannot wait to go back. Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"I don't know what these complainers are complaining about. Went to this wonderful establishment and had a great time. The Lockhart is a Harry Potter inspired restaurant and bar (with no official relation to the Harry Potter brand). The inside is very nicely crafted and has a dark/magical vibe to it. The bartenders made some of the most delicious drinks I have ever had (beneath a well placed 'potions and elixirs' sign). Some of the drinks arrive set ablaze (specifically some of the pitcher drinks). It is true, they have a restaurant not a bar license, so you are required to buy a mildly priced entree to be allowed to order an alcoholic drink (between 11 and 14 dollars each). I had the beets salad and it was delicious. The better (aka 'butter') beer and obliviate drinks were so delicious. Within the menu and bar are many other subtle references to Harry Potter. Will definitely be back. The one thing that is true is the background music is just your typical bar music... For some this may detract from the experience, but I certainly had a great time!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Harry Potter fan so naturally we had to come to this bar! There was a bit of a wait, I am told there is always a line, but the hostess was very accommodating. The inside of the bar was as magical as I expected and the drinks did not disappoint! I can't wait to either return or for another bar like this to open closer to me!"}
{"text":"I am a bit sad that they don't serve delicious tapas anymore!! They removed them from the menu a couple months ago, but now they offer some snacks and a delicious cheesecake instead.   Also betterbeer is good as always, but I still think it is overpriced - one clearly pays extra for the ambience and theme."}
{"text":"So great ! They put so much effort into all the decor and drink names. I had a butterbear mocktail and it was really good. The bartender was really nice and he had in-depth knowledge about harry potter which is always a plus haha."}
{"text":"If you're serious about cocktails, you'll know which ones to get. This place has similar drinks to barchef for the fraction of the price. Sure the atmosphere isn't quite the same but this place is super unpretentious. I kind of like that the Harry Potter stuff is understated, definitely not the focus of the bar. Drinks are great! Haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"HUGE Harry Potter fan. So this was almost the entire reason I came to Toronto (live about 4-5 hours drive away). The location is off the beaten path and I had to wait AGES to get in on a Sunday night but it was so so worth it. I had a pretty good sandwich and some fun cocktails. The place is really small, but we made new friends. Careful on the stairs if you go to the bathroom, they're a bit uneven, but in the bathroom everyone write their fave HP quotes on the wall in chalk. What a fun experience. Really sweet waitress too."}
{"text":"Went strictly for the drinks. A nice little Harry Potter inspired bar. I ordered the Betterbeer and my husband ordered the Campfire Old Fashioned. Delicious! Very unique tastes. They had a ton of different alcoholic drinks for everyone to choose from. The place is very small. Not meant for large groups. Cozy and a nice atmosphere. Music was at a lower volume so I could have a conversation. Greatly appreciated. Didn't try the food there so I can't comment. But I would go back just for the yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"As has been mentioned repeatedly, this Harry Potter inspired bar is only mildly Harry Potter themed. However, it definitely has some charm and character. The tapas were delicious and reasonably priced (I paid $5 for zucchini crostini and $5 for polenta fries and I was beyond stuffed), and the graffiti walls in the bathrooms are covered in wonderful Harry Potter quotes (my personal favourite being \"ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE\" written in red over one of the toilets). The drinks were small, tasty, and expensive. Not really my style, I'm more of a beer drinker myself, and they only have a few beers on tap. But, when in Rome! Myself and a couple friends tried the Befuddlement Draft, a flaming cauldron of liquor you mix yourself, and I have to admit it was pretty cool. Tasted mainly of peach schnapps, but the experience of it was great.  I also ordered a Caesar \"hot\".... Now I can handle my spice level pretty well but this was pushing it. My stomach was hurtin' a bit from this one. Be careful with how you order, they ain't timid with the spice!  The layout of the place is not ideal, it's a tiny place with long lineups generally and it was sometimes hard to hear my friends talk, but I think the great food and interesting drinks can appease most muggles."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! I am here right now enjoying a greenhouse no.2 which is an absolutely awesome cocktail and I also enjoyed some BUTTER BEER! It is absolutely great! The staff here rocks! Very  friendly and helpful! Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hangout. Came for the HP hype, stayed for the fantastic staff, service, and quality of the drinks/food. They play fun music, too! Hint: make sure you go to the bathroom even if you don't need to. It's very... well decorated. :)"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the decor here is fantastic! We loved taking pictures. The \"better beer\" was really good and the bartender who made it was awesome. My struggle was the food. I had a fancy grilled cheese type sandwich with gouda, spinach and leeks. I think there were just far too many leeks, it make me gag. The soup was also off (tomato) but I don't know quite why. Hopefully other selections there are more appealing, but most things were sold out when we arrived for brunch."}
{"text":"This is a super lowkey and quaint bar in Toronto and is a must go to place for all you Harry Potter Fans out there. All the details in the bar from the liquor in potion viles, all the Dobby framed pictures, and memorabilia and signage in the place, it's super cool.   For drinks, we went with the Befuddlement Draft which is a cool interactive cocktail that has a glass within the pint that the drinks served in (meant for a group). The drink is pretty strong and the closest thing I can compare it to is an AMF? Basically lots of different types of alcohol mixed together.   We also ordered the Butter Beer in a pint and oh my gosh this was SO DELICIOUS. For anyone who loves a sweet buttery cocktail, this fits the bill for you.   Overall a cool atmosphere if you want to go to a bar with a friend for a catchup where you can actually hear what they're saying :D"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY... WATCH YOUR ATTITUDE PLEASE!  My friend is a huge HP fan and she has been talking about this bar for ages. However, we did not have a pleasant time here tonight. When we arrived the bar, all the tables were occupied so the four of us stood at the entrance, waiting for further instructions. But the female bartender (who definitely saw us) seem to ignore us. Few minutes later the other male tender asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar (while he was delivering drinks). Her attitude was horrible when she served us (she threw the coasters to us?!) and when my friends turned around to take some pictures and wanted to observe the place, she said \"You should be sitting on the opposite side!\" We were shocked!  We ordered the Better Beer Pitcher to share, the drink is okay and it tastes like Yakult. After we paid, she looked at our bill and shook her head. I mean WHAT?! Seriously my friends and I felt very much disrespected from her attitude. This bartender's name starts with an N."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly impressed by the cocktails we ordered. My drink was rum-based (doesn't seem to exist on the website menu anymore) and its anise syrup was far too overwhelming that I wasn't enjoying it. I then ordered a bourbon-based drink (I'm a whiskey/bourbon lover) and didn't enjoy it either. I decided to try something on the food menu. I ordered the 'Botany\" themed plate, which I thought was going to be an array of prepared veggies and sauce/dip, but it was an overwhelming plate preparation that seemed more challenging than enjoyable to eat. Creative, but it just didn't fit this particular dish. I did admire my friend's risotto order, it looked delicious. The bar itself doesn't scream Harry Potter, it just has few visual references posted here and there (mostly beasts), and some apothecary-style posters, but that was it. Every hour or so, they turn off the lights to show off the glow-in-the-dark paint designs on the walls, featuring a dragon flying across the ceiling, but the designs were so childlike that it wasn't really impressive, just a cute way to implement glow paint. I'm glad I tried the place, but it won't be regularly visiting it."}
{"text":"Food was very interesting, not conventional. Drinks were even weirder. Although the Harry Potter theme was very cool and very well done. Definitely recommend if you're a fan."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place and have been asking my friends to come here. Came here on a Saturday night with a couple of friends. When we got in, it was pretty busy but after 10mins of standing, we managed to bag ourselves a couple of seats at the bar. I ordered the BetterBeer (which is the Harry Potter inspired Butterbeer) and it was so yummy!! I don't normally like ale but this one tasted nothing like it as they add ginger ale and topped with cream and a skewered marshmallow. YUM!! Place is really small for what I'd expected and despite being a 'Harry Potter inspired' bar, the cocktails were presented pretty bland. I had hoped for weird presentations with dry ice, the whole shabang.  But overall, really enjoyed this bar and will definitely come back for the BetterBeer again!"}
{"text":"Great for nerds! Took me too long to get my butt here, but now I try to go as often as I can. Perfect for a date, just don't go during peak hours, or get there early.  Small snacks, cute bartenders (hello)! Try the Betterbeer or Campfire Old Fashioned (marshmallows!)"}
{"text":"Note: Come on a weekday! Unless you don't mind waiting two hours for a table...   This Harry Potter inspired bar is pretty cool. There's some subtle decor that tributes to the series but it's definitely not something out of Orlando's Wizarding World theme park. That being said, it's a nice place to hang out. It's a small bar so it's nice and cozy, it could probably accommodate 4-5 groups of five with more seating for doubles.   The drinks are epic. I highly recommend the befuddlement cocktail to share. I loved the fire element, and being able to mix in the shots yourself. But be warned, it's pretty strong.   There's limited food options, this probably isn't the place to get a meal, but it's great for bar snacks and the prices are good. If you're super hungry, the steak sandwich is probably the most filling thing on the menu.  Service is incredibly fast, despite all the customers and the few staff. On top of that, the bar tenders and servers and even the bouncer are super welcoming, friendly, fast and enthusiastic which is crazy considering how many orders they get.   The crowd is mixed, you'll see people that probably just turned legal, and others old enough to be their parents.  I'll definitely come back, but on a weekday. (They do not take reservations)."}
{"text":"Came here as we were intrigued by the Harry Potter theme. Definitely not what I had expected. The place is small...so having large groups might be difficult. Love/hate relationship with the interior design but I did enjoy the potion wall. Unless you're actually there to drink alcohol, the menu isn't really for you. They don't have any \"mocktails\" but can whip something up for you non-alcoholic if you ask them to. Their cocktails though are interesting. Some of the cocktails were hit or misses but then again that is all due to personal taste. Not sure if I will revisit. It was a fun first time but wasn't really a place I could see myself going again."}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews on here. Harry Potter themed? These people must have never read the books. The amount of Harry Potter references are negligible. A few random drinks with a couple names, and a couple chalk drawings of terms like \"mischief managed\" on the wall. That's. It. That's all. Nothing more.   Also, the prices? Holy f***. A pitcher of butterbeer for $32? That's 75% cream and ice? Get the hell outa here. A chocolate frog for $6 that's simply a plain chocolate press with some peanut butter inside? Pathetic.  The only reason I'm giving them 2 instead of 1 stars is because the wait staff and the ambiance were nice. They get the negatives though for claiming to have a theme that is almost non-existent, and gauging the prices on ripoffs simply because they share a name."}
{"text":"Soliiiiiid.   #Befuddlement drink blew my mind because the presentation reminded me of Goblet of Fire, but once we started to pour out the drinks into mini crystal cups, I was suddenly taken to that part where Dumbledore and Harry went into a cave to look for Voldemort's Horcrux, and Dumbledore had to drink that blueish liquid by pouring it into a crystal cup. And the struggle that Dumbledore felt was suddenly upon us when we ordered a second round and we were having a difficult time finishing it. We ended up passing this onto another table that looked like they could use some of this.  Also, I'm not sure what the official name of this drink, but we also had the Butterbeers, which were freaking amazing. Buttery, citrus-y. and delicious, it made me wonder, \"Is this what Butterbeers would taste like in the wizarding world?\" I'd hope so. They were just that good.   The only minor thing that bugs me is that the place is too small and there aren't enough seats. Luckily my friend and I found seats but I can see how inconvenient it would've been if we didn't get seats. Regardless, the service was good and the place is well decorated. Plus the drinks were very good, and I don't think that minor thing is enough to dock a point-- I mean star. I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  This place definitely have great atmosphere and the decor does reflect the Harry Potter series. The bar is small - with about 5 tables, not really suitable for a large crowd. The menu items names were inspired by the series which was pretty cool.  We liked the buttermilk fried chicken with the sweet sauce and it came out fresh, tender and crispy! It came out a tad oily but not a big complain since it was fried.  The drinks were meh. Betterbeer was more soda like than beer like. Now what we expected. We also had one of the sharing cocktails that was lit on fire. Pretty but it tasted diluted. Great to share between 3-4 people.   Also tried the chocolate toad for $6. Not worth it. Not wowed. Not great for 6 bucks.   More on the pricey side but it was a good experience. Service was decent. Probably a good one-time experience. Don't forget to check out the washroom!"}
{"text":"Part of why I decided to go to Toronto was because of this bar. It is absolutely beautiful. You need to get there right when it opens. I went on a Wednesday or Thursday night and it was packed (although it may have been trivia night).   My friend got the Betterbeer and she loved it. I hate tequila but it does work. I got the Gin Weasley and Jesus if it isn't strong. She lovely bartender did warn me, though.   Make sure you map out where it is before you go or you could miss it."}
{"text":"Loved this bar! Even if I wasn't a huge Harry Potter fan, this place is amazing all on its own merit. We got the Botanist and the Better Beer; both dangerously good.   Sure there's not a huge amount of HP stuff at the bar, but you can tell everything draws inspiration from the movies/books. Plus the bartenders are super friendly which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Colour me Unimpressed and Annoyed.   The Lockhart is a tiny little place with only the vaguest of Harry Potter trappings. The servers have some really backwards idea as to what constitutes professional in terms of seating and management. Little tip for you, Lockhart. Don't do reservations in your first few months of opening. It just gums up the flow of people and makes your already stupidly long lines even dumber.   My friends got their twenty minutes before I did and rather than leaving two seats of the table of four open they shoved a couple of randoms beside my friends, refused to move them, and then bold-facedly told me \"Even if the two sitting beside your friends, who requested a table for four left there are people who would get in before you.\" I stood in line for an hour and a half just to get told that. I left after that/  You want to over spend on Tapas and novelty geek beverages, go to another bar. I suggest the Black Dice, which is literally down the street. Better prices, better service, and people who know what they are doing.   Maybe in four months when the staff knows what they are doing and the hype dies down it'll be worth it. Now? it's a pass. I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is beyond overrated. Not only is there no Harry Potter vibe, but you're also forced to order 1 mediocre food item PER PERSON.  The drinks were good and pretty original, but since you can't come here just for a drink, I'd skip and check out the many great restaurants and bars in Montreal."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the media-hype, this is a tiny neighborhood bar. There physically isn't space for your large party, so don't try. This is, however, a great place for a couple friends to hang and nerd-out over all the inside jokes scattered throughout the bar. The cocktails are uniformly delicious,  the staff are attentive and very friendly, and the background music selection was excellent. It would be improved by more space, of course, but the intimate atmosphere is also very appealing."}
{"text":"What do you do when you're traveling with a friend who loves all things Harry Potter as much is you do? You look and find H.P. haunts.  My friend Gina came across this as a potential place for us to check out during a recent visit to Toronto. After a long evening of walking out and about Toronto, we decided to stop by and check this out for a nightcap.   This place was legit. And a bit cozy. I think they must have received JK Rowling's blessings because there were a lot of items and authentic copies of props used from the movies and the books.   There were: High top tables, a few regular tables and chairs, an L-shaped bar, small kitchen for eats and treats.   The menu was adorable. So many bevies to chose from. My friend ended up ordering the 'Gin Weasley'. I had the Captain Picard pot of Earl Gray tea.(This totally tickled my Star Trek funny bone). We shared a bowl of roasted spicy and sweet Dragon nuts to nosh on. We passed on the Chocolate Frogs because they sold out earlier in the evening.   It's the place to go for Harry Potter trivia, restorative potions and elixirs. Make sure you check out the artwork in the halls and the Ministry of Magic's entrances in the loo.  I did spy someone wearing a Deathly Hollows T-shirt and another wearing a cloak. And a third wearing Ravenclaw scarf.  I am glad we two Hufflepuffs stopped by.  All is well."}
{"text":"First things first - we gave up. We arrived at the bar and looked inside and then at each other, puzzled, thinking \"that's it???\" It's a tiny bar that fits like 15 people at a time, with a 3 hour wait time if you reserve a spot (which I never actually got a call back for, even 5 hours later as they're still open!) And for what, exactly? The older man at the door was QUITE UNPLEASANT and accused us of being \"difficult\" when we politely asked if we could pull up a chair as there was a table for 4 available but we had a party of 5. We were immediately turned off and I immediately got defensive and snapped back... They serve some drinks in cauldrons etc but there's nothing actually mind blowing about this place at all. It's getting a lot of hype for its resonance with Harry potter fans but I can confidently say that there is hardly anything in this bar that has anything to do with Harry potter. Do yourself a favour and take a hard pass on this place, there are hundreds of other good bars within walking distance that are much more worth your valuable time and money."}
{"text":"The butterbeer was better than I even imagined. I loved the music, atmosphere and decor and the owners were lovely! Would go again next time I'm in TO."}
{"text":"I thought I was ordering beer but it was tequila. But it was still good. The wizard theme was cool."}
{"text":"Not magical food.  The decorative elements are amazing. Harry Potter style. Friendly staff. I had the fried chicken and it wasn't a good choice. It came barely burnt, with a bitter crust. The corn bread tasted nothing and was kinda dry. It was so greasy that even the generous lime salad wasn't capable of waving the grease taste from my mouth at the end of the dish. Going to a muggle restaurant next time!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for their Caesars (Bloody Mary in the U.S.A.)! The secret ingredient is srirarcha, which I never thought to use instead of hot sauce. I think this is how I will make all of our bloody marys from this point forward because they were so good!  We came here at the intrigue of the Harry Potter fan in our party and we were not disappointed. Of course (as you've probably read) there are no outright Harry Potter themes that someone who knows nothing about H.P. will be able to point out. If you've read the books or seen the movies, you will probably really love this place. The \"Potions & Elixers\" wall has some cocktail mixes in jars with H.P.-inspired labels, statements and symbols on another wall all pay homage to H.P., and you can even look up some of your favorite H.P. facts with \"free internet for Muggles\" if you'd like.   We did not have any of the food and stopped in for brunch hours to have a cocktail. They do not have the full cocktail menu until their evening hours, but they still have six or seven brunch-friendly cocktails."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times now for Harry Potter Trivia, which runs on two Tuesdays a month. Pros: The place is adorable, the owners have put an impressive amount of effort in the Harry Potter aesthetic and it is charming (with little tidbits of HP fandom to be discovered all over the bar, including the bathroom!). My friend and I split a pitcher of the Butterbeer, which was delicious and surprisingly big. Lasted us the whole game of trivia. Bar stuff are super lovely as well. Cons: The trivia is HARD (as in, if you haven't read the book that very morning you will definitely fail). We still had fun of course. Come early (as in like an hour or two) since it is super crammed in there and trivia night is popular. The food is ok, though I'm not sure it's worth the price. We split a shrimp toast which was about 9$ and the size of my thumb (delicious though).   Haven't been for the brunch yet!"}
{"text":"NERDS! NERDS EVERYWHERE! Okay, I'm mostly kidding.   I've stopped in a couple times here on weeknights when the place wasn't rammed. The beer taps are mediocre (no IPAs in a Dundas West bar?!) but the bartenders were friendly. The last time I wanted food but the kitchen seemed to close a couple hours before I arrived.   So we came back for brunch and I now feel comfortable giving a full review. I had a weekend special which was Chicken & Waffles Eggs Benny. So basically you go their standard chicken and waffles but with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. It was quite good, but portion wise not the most filling. For those who go with the standard Eggs Benny, you get a side of home fries. I didn't get to try them, but saw them on someone else plate and they looked good. Service was still friendly but more spotty this time than when I had previously just saddled up at the bar.  This place gets by on the tongue in cheek Harry Potter gimmicks and the crowd it brings because of that. Personally, I have no idea about Harry Potter so I really couldn't pick up on any of it. But the Potions and Elixers signage behind the bar is neat I guess.  Non-Rating-Impacting Side tangent: I can't help but think how the owner of Lucy Brock (the bar that originally had this location) must absolutely hate this place now. The man bartended to an empty room for months after spending the money on the lovely reclaimed wood bar along the front window and the awesome penny encrusted bar that still remains. I mean there must be some resentment seeing this place absolutely blowing up with lines down the street on weekends. Regardless of what resentment that guy has, I'll tip my hat to the owners of this place for at least crushing it since opening."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews and the BS rule that you have to order a plate each if you're drinking, I really wanted to check this place out coz I'm a huge Potter geek.   There was no line when we got there at around 6-6:30pm. We were a group of 6 and so had to sit outside which sucked coz there's nothing Potter-like about sitting outside.   The food... is disgusting. The flatbread \"pizza\" was a disgrace. The poutine was so sweet - like how do you f that up?!! The only thing that was apparently edible was the fried chicken, though it was dry. At least have normal pub food like fries, chicken tenders, fish n chips, nachos - we would have all been more happy with that!!   I would give this place 2* but the waitress redeemed the night for us and the pitchers of booze were pretty yummy. I especially liked the Marauder's pitcher to share that they light on fire. The potion one was good too. Avoid the \"better beer\" aka Butterbeer - so gross and nothing like the one they serve at Universal Studios!"}
{"text":"Potterheads Unite!  This place is just too damn cool.  I came here my first trip to Toronto in January, had to make the trek because I saw this place all over Pinterest, and again in June.  Luckily, my boyfriend is a Potterhead as well so he was enjoying this as much as I was.  We really weren't sure where to begin with our drink order but being the tequila dare devils that we are we HAD to do the Dementor's Kiss.  As it is being served to us the waitress tells us that she saw a guy take it and he had to run across the street to chug a carton of milk. Naturally I started freaking out but did it anyways. Mind you, we ordered it with the Befuddlement Draft (which comes out flaming) so there was not much to chase with. Regardless, we both threw down the shot.  Mike was fine, I however thought I was going to pass out.  He said he had never seen someone go that white before.  Don't worry- I recovered! About 10 minutes later, but I was fine and he took another shot! We also had a mousse - style caprese which they don't serve anymore but was so delicious.  This past time we went back we did the cheddar mouse which was also very yummy, but the warm cucumbers did nothing to help me while suffering from.... ANOTHER DEMENTOR'S KISS SHOT! Yes - I am a glutton for punishment. This one really screwed me and Mike's lips actually swole, but again, lived to tell the tale.  I would 100% check it out, DO THE SHOT, have a few drinks and take in the decor. I noticed different things and left a few fun messages in the bathroom (the walls are chalkboard).  It's a place that I know I will go back to each trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Came back here to bring my sister and her husband - both huge harry potter fans. We had a great time.  They've amped up the decor from my last visit in November! For first timers - the place is small, there's some standing room and seats by the bar, as well as 4-5 tables. They have a fantastic variety of drinks, and about 10 items on the menu, tapas style.  I definitely recommend the Better Beer - a bit sweet, but citrusy too. Perfect. They didn't have this last time! They have a tea-based cocktail as well, but now they only have a peach base (before they had a raspberry base too). It's still really good.  Food-wise, I still recommend the zucchini crostini and the polenta fries. We ordered 5-6 items for the 4 of us, and we were pretty full. However, if you're a serious meat eater, this might not be the place for you as only 2 of their items feature meat.  Came here on Friday around 7pm and there was no wait."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD this bar is every Potterhead's dream! It's very small (only about 4-5 tables) so get here early or on an off-night. My friends and I came on a Sunday night so it was pretty much empty except for two couples. Our bartender was very friendly and talked us through the drinks menu.  I was really sad that they didn't have any Better Beer that day (they were out of the \"secret ingredient\"). Instead we got a Befuddlement Draft to share, which was still pretty cool and delicious. I also wanted to try the Dementor's Kiss, a shot of ghost pepper infused tequila. I thought I knew what I was getting into - the bartender even made sure that I knew how spicy it would be before serving it - but wow I was NOT prepared for that. The shot was fine going down but then continued to burn my mouth, my throat, my stomach in the minutes after. Thankfully, my table had ordered a plate of baked brie and bread so I stuffed 3 slices of cheese bread down my throat to try to counteract the spiciness. Roughly 30 minutes later, I finally felt normal again but be warned! This shot is NOT for the lighthearted!  The decor of the place was so cute. They have drawings and quotes written all over the walls and one of the shelves have the Harry Potter Funko Pop! dolls all lined up.  Keep in mind though that this is not strictly a Harry Potter bar. It's just a normal bar with Harry Potter decorations and themed drinks. Don't expect to walk into the Leaky Cauldron or the Three Broomsticks - you can get that at Universal Studios' Harry Potter World. But for a place that's not officially associated with Harry Potter, this bar is awesome. I'd definitely come back again to try their other drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic.  We honestly didn't wait long to get in (only 2 people though) and once we were in we never wanted to leave.  I wish I could have tried every drink on the menu, but unfortunately my liver would now allow it!  The ones we did have were amazing.  The atmosphere was exactly what I expected; Harry Potter hints with an overall apothecary feel.  The bartender was on the ball and really worked to make us feel welcome and appreciated as customers. I only wish I live closer to Toronto so I could come more frequently.   I guarantee that I will be back!"}
{"text":"I personally loved this bar! Super hipster, fun staff, unique atmosphere and the exposed rock/overall decor was nice.  I think a lot of people are coming down too hard on the place not being \"HP enough\". Like okay they don't have levitating coasters and the Hogwarts express coming through the wall, but let's be honest, if you want the full experience you should be going to the Harry Potter World in Florida or the UK. The Lockhart does a great job making subtle references to the Harry Potter world, which I think is better for nostalgic reflection.   Drinks were well done. We got the Befuddlement Draft before we had to take off. It was fun, had a fire element and you got to mix it in yourself, and it's got a punch! Definitely recommend it! Tad expensive but worth it!  Only thing to complain about was the wait! Waited over an hour and a half when I was staring at two open spots by the window. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Its really exciting to hear of a Harry Potter inspired place, but I feel like there should be a little bit more decorations and it doesn't have to be exactly Harry Potter stuff. Food was not bad, my favorite is the Fried Chicken. In terms of drinks we had a pitcher of the Better Beer to share, I got the Flaming Arnold, and my friend got the popular red one with a car inside (sorry forgot the name) and they were all just okay. The Flaming Arnold tasted like Mimosa, which was pretty good. Our waitress wasn't exactly the nicest so in that sense it was just okay too."}
{"text":"My expectations were very high...too high.  I did not read the reviews prior to know what to expect.  By pure chance, we chose around 4pm on a Saturday to attend, it doesn't open until 5pm which initially we were bummed about waiting an hour. However, as the line started to form behind I realized how very lucky we were! We got one of the 5 tables in the place :).   At first, I was disappointed by the tiny menu both in drinks and food. We were starving from shopping all day, so we ordered almost half the menu. We got Polenta fries (B+), baked brie (A-),Zuccini Crostini (A-) and Tempura Vegtables (B-). Most of the food came in baskets, very casual and in a timely manner. I had the drink of the day The Pink Lady (A+) (needs to be on the regular menu for sure!)  My friend had the Butter Beer (A+). The glasses were all beautiful, great presentation.  My friend is Vegetarian, so I was happy they had yummy options we could both enjoy. I understand (for trademark reasons) that this place can't be super harry potter-y. I enjoyed that it wasn't cheesy . Our waiters were pleasant and helpful but seemed kinda over it. They didn't give us plates for our food, or water for the table (not deal breakers but when you order food you kind of expect it.).  We didn't get the Befuddlement Draft (which seems to be the star of the show) but everyone around us did. It was fun watching them light it on fire,and watching people try to figure out how to mix it and drink it. I love that they offer cheap mocktails (5$) ,and complimentary juice and soda. That is a really nice touch!  The atmosphere was good, but the music was NELLY! We were joking that it felt like a surreal dream that didn't quite make sense. In a harry potter bar, listening and dancing to nelly...all I needed to complete the dream was a high school teacher popping in. The speakers were terrible with lots of feedback.  Overall, our entire experience was only 1 hr (other people were asking for our seat before we even got the bill..) Was it fun ? Yes. Would I recommend it? Meh . If you're a super fan it's not harry pottery enough. If you're not a super fan, it's not really worth the trek to Little Portugal.  If you happen to be in the area, sure.. it's cute."}
{"text":"I'll totally overlook the HP theme because I knew going in it was subtle and it was, so that was expected. But the food and service were a huge problem. My boyfriend and I went around noon on a Sunday for brunch. We came in and were not acknowledged, so we sat wherever. There was a bartender and a server both on staff (and the place was not busy), but it took about 3 min to get water. Then another 5 min for one of them to come back and offer coffee. Then another 5 min to get a menu.... and in the meantime, both of the staff were putting in concentrated effort to prepare a flaming Pepsi for the kitchen staff. Awesome. We finally ordered from the limited menu only to be told that what we wanted was not available. We got grilled cheese and tomato soup and the soup was literally pureed tomatoes with no seasoning (and for $11 for a sandwich, I would expect some flavor at least). We finished our food, waited 10 min for our plates to get cleared and another 10 for the bill... and I mean there was literally 12 other people in the whole place. Bad service and bland food. Meh at best"}
{"text":"Lovely staff, delicious drink and wonderfully nerdy! Would love to go back :)"}
{"text":"The staff was great, the drinks were superb, and the food (we tried the salmon croquettes) was delicious. We will definitely be visiting again next time we are in Toronto. The ambiance in the bar is close knit and kinda feels like something you would read about in the books."}
{"text":"This bar was too cute and the drinks were phenomenal! I don't like the fact that you have to get a meal to get drinks and I wasn't a fan of their poutine other than that I can't complain. Mel was awesome.. we had the best bartender!! Will be back for the drinks!!"}
{"text":"As you might have allowed yourself to remember--or not, depending on your level of overexcitement anticipating a visit here--this bar is not literally affiliated with Warner Bros. If that were the case, you'd probably see Harry, Hermione, and Ron cutouts and crap all over the walls, an animatronic Dobby sitting on the bar, and \"authentic\" Hogwarts mugs for sale for $40 each. Luckily, the bar doesn't actually have anything to do with Harry Potter. If you want that, I recommend Universal Studios.  All of that being said, it sort of just becomes a bar, at that point. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely Harry Potter inspirations here. The neon 'All Was Well' sign, the drinks named after characters (such as the cleverly titled 'Gin Weasley'), and uh...the fact that 'Potions & Elixirs' is painted on the wall above the alcohol? It's cool and all, don't get me wrong. And without getting the attention of Warner Bros. legal counsel, there's only so much they can do here.  The drinks we had were pretty strong. Personally, that causes me to enjoy it less. That might make some of you rate it a 10 out of 5 here. Ya know, if you're heavily into drinking. You might be thinking, \"Josh L., why were you even at a bar if you don't like drinking?\" That's a fair question. I don't have a good answer for you. We were mainly curious about the Harry Potter stuff.  Overall, it's fine. The staff is awesome, I should say. Maybe my expectations were too high that it would be straight out of the books or movies. Seems like a good business idea, though: Just slightly rip off an extremely popular franchise. Maybe I'll open a convenience store called \"The Pocket Monster Stop\" or a car wash called \"The Bogdan Express\". Can you name what show I ripped off that second one from?"}
{"text":"Could have been awesome. The music sucks. The better beer isn't better than anything. Food is overpriced for what it is. The service was good."}
{"text":"My friend invited me to the \"Harry Potter\" bar (say what?!) as her cousin wanted to celebrate her birthday here - being a massive HP fan.  Because I'm really out of it I'd never heard of this bar but was curious to see what the hype was (and seriously who turns down a birthday invite?!  Tres tacky).  A few things - it's tiny.  Really tiny.  Like maybe 20 people can fit comfortably inside.  There is a bouncer.  Yes...I kid you not.  And he will bounce you out if you try to sneak in.  There is always a line.  We went around 11:30pm and still had to wait for about 20 or so minutes as we were a large group.  I would suggest that if you want to check it out try going with a smaller group and maybe on a weekday.    It's dark inside with a homage to all things Potter inside.  Now I've watched all the movies but in no way would I say I'm a fan so I really couldn't tell you how closely this came to playing off things in the movies.  I did see the 9 3/4 sign and of course they have a wall of potions/elixirs.    There are a few tables for groups and then a few stand up tables and then the bar.  The server was really nice and made recommendations when some people in our group were not sure what to drink.  She had a lot of energy and never made us feel rushed which was nice and took her time explaining the menu.   I just had the Royal-Tea which was a nice blend of peach vodka with a bunch of other liquors/flavours and with base notes of tea.  You could really taste the tea which I appreciate.  It was light and refreshing. A few others ordered this and all found it to be delightful.  I believe it was about $10 which isn't bad but I didn't feel any magic after drinking it.  Someone ordered the \"better beer\" which basically looked like a milkshake with a toasted marshmallow on top...but since he had 3 I will assume he liked it!    No one ordered food so I can't comment on that but I did look at the food menu online and it looked interesting.  Maybe if I come back I will try some nibbles...but honestly while I'm glad for the opportunity to try it, I  just can't see myself standing in line for this place again.    Did it.  Done it.    Poof..now I'm gone  :)"}
{"text":"Setting: small bar, has a Harry Potter theme extending to its drinks menu. Personally felt the theming was not particularly followed through what with the numerous bottles of American whisky on show and overall un-hogwarts feel of the bar. I guess it's difficult balancing act of having a theme but not going full Disney world and becoming tacky.  Drinks : great selection, the butter beer was bizarrely exactly what I imagined it to taste like, despite consisting of ginger ale.   Atmosphere: chill and dark, friendly locals, our group was definitely made to feel welcome.   Staff: friendly and quick. One bartender had hair like hermione, though she laboured the point a few times that this was coincidental   Recommmend, would come back"}
{"text":"I went there today with a friend. What a wonderfully cozy bar with magical decor, delicious and super creative cocktails, and awesome service. There is music playing, but it's just the right volume to enjoy it while still being able to talk to each other without the need to speak louder. The food is coming soon, right now there are just a few appetizers but they are tasty. I am looking forward to the full menu. If it is going to be as creative as the cocktails, it's going to be delicious. I'm definitely coming back.  Upd: came back. Summary of a few cocktails: Shaklebolt cocktail - citrus, rum, burned wood nice smell.  Maradeur - glintwein and sangria married in a huge deer head shaped pitcher. On fire. Should I say more? :)  Better beer - marshmeloes, fire, whipped cream - totally magical  Going to order befuddlement pitcher next time. Lots of fire, fun and awesomeness"}
{"text":"Well, unfortunately I was way to excited to go to this place and all it did was disappoint. We went yesterday, Wednesday, because we read all the reviews and how terrible the wait time was so went in the middle of the week. Point is we drank prior to getting here and the drinks were so light that we were actually sobering up while at the bar! I watched the bartender make the drinks (since we sat right in front of him) and it was literally 3/4 gingerale. My friends and I drove two and a half hours to go to this place (then stayed at a hotel) just to say we went, it's not worth it. The staff was sweat, the food was mediocre but the drinks were lacking all the alcohol! I'm sorry but it defeats the purpose of a BAR! The ambiance and staff were pretty good so only reason why I'm giving them three stars."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. Came for dessert and a drink. Was told in line that you had to order a food item to get alcohol, which is fine. When we got in were then told dessert was excluded from that because of their liquor license. Food is mediocre and they shouldn't force their patrons to purchase it. Will not come back"}
{"text":"A poor effort to say the least! I admit we are big Harry Potter fans and were really looking forward to a little \"magic.\" Disappointed to say the least...you can't just throw a few pictures of Doby the House Elf on a wall and call yourself a \"Harry Potter themed bar\"...ok, they did have a few other items, but really not much. The drinks were mediocre at best. The must was a kind of rock-metal mix that certainly did not go with the \"theme.\" And we had a \"chocolate frog\" for dessert which was most likely bought from a store, unwrapped and dropped on a plate. All in all a very, VERY disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We only got to spend 15 minutes here. I'm going to write two separate reviews for this.   From a bar patron perspective: 3 Stars The place is smaller than I expected, even for Toronto. They were supposed to open at 5 but didn't open until 5:15. I didn't understand what the hold up was or why they couldn't let us in, even if they were still getting a few things together. There was a line of 10 people outside.   We ordered quickly and let them know of our time crunch. The drinks were excellent! I got The Shacklebolt and my friend got the Dr. Manhattan. The Manhattan is suggested to help warm you on a chilly day - I'm not even a manhattan fan normally. This was good.   It's not all Harry Pottery - so even the non fans will enjoy.   From a Harry Potter Fan Perspective: 5 stars OMG this place is so cool. It's not all Harry Potter it. But with little going on in the Harry Potter world (Fantastic Beasts and a play pending), it was nice to see something new and cool come into the fandom. The All was well sign. The potions sign. A stag on the wall. The name Lockhart. If you look hard enough at the menu you'll see some other references.  I got the Shacklebolt (what what) it was good. My friend to the Dr. Manhattan. I'm not normally a manhattan fan, but this was good!   They opened a little late, a line of HP nerds had formed. A guy waiting was rocking a Gryffindor tie. We sparked a nice conversation with some girls from LA.   We had to leave quickly. Wish I got to try more of the drinks."}
{"text":"Despite the mixed reviews, I visited The Lockhart with my best friend as we are both huge Harry Potter fans, and we felt like we had to go once we know it existed. We walked in on a Sunday night, and were seated right away. It was dark, but the decor was definitely cute! I understand the desire to have it be VERY HP-esque, but I totally get why they couldn't go that route.  We started with drinks. Our first round she got the Flying Ford Anglia, and I got the Obliviate. Both were amazing. The Flying Ford Anglia came with a fluff of cotton candy and a tiny plastic car! The Obliviate was essentially a grown up vodka cranberry. For our second round, she got Bella's Tricks and I ordered the Rock Cake, only to be persuaded by our server to try the Flaming Arnold instead because it was his favorite (and he could set it on fire). They didn't disappoint!  For dinner (since yet, you DO have to order food, and it isn't their fault!), we ordered the flame roasted eggplant dip, which was amazingggg. It comes with pita triangles, and celery and cucumber sticks. We gobbled that up like we were starving! We also ordered the fantastic beets salad, which was nice, though I wished the beets were more caramelized than they were. Finally, we also ordered the fried chicken, which was delicious as well - it came with cornbread and wilted greens. For dessert we ordered the honey and spice cake.  Over the course of our meal, we discussed what it was that turned so many people off from this place, and we decided that it probably has something to do with the fact that their menu is more of a foodie menu. And while WE liked the foodie menu, the cross-section of millennial, Harry Potter fans who are also foodies may be a bit slimmer than they anticipated.  The service was a bit slow, which was why I can't give it a five-star rating. It was just the bartender and one server, who was also acting as the host and bussing tables, so our meal took a good two hours from start to finish. The two of them were having tons of fun, though, so I will give them credit!"}
{"text":"If you are a Harry Potter fan, you have to visit this pub! Stopped by to have drinks before dinner and sat at the bar. The bar tender was lovely and suggested we try their fiery caldron drink (I know have totally forgotten what it's called). What a sight to see as he mixed different liquors and then lit it up. The caldron provided 3 people with two glasses each and cost around $35. The bar tender also mentioned that they had trivia nights a couple times in the month. The crowd was very casual and the space is small however the walls were filled with Dobey (probably spelled that wrong) pictures, a wand that was framed and cards on the ceiling from the trivia nights. They also had a wall with potions and elixirs (right behind their bar area). Something different in the city and a cool site to see."}
{"text":"This place was great! We waited in line for just a few minutes. Once we got in, we got drinks right away. I got the Shaklebolt. It was delicious--spicy and gingery. I loved it.  While my friend and i were sitting at the bar, we struck up a conversation with the bartender (who ended up being one of the owners) and he was SO nice. He chatted with us for a while and, despite the line outside, never made us feel rushed to leave.  Overall, this is a great place for both Harry Potter fans and non fans but those of you passionate about the Wizarding world, this is the place for you! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Neat place, not as Potter-esque as I imagined. Just a hipster vibe. Very funky & punk decor, kind of all over the place, with small Harry Potter reminders here and there, not very cohesive; think more along the lines of Knockturn Alley, dark and grungy. (Remember, I'm a Floridian who's visited Potter World in Orlando regularly. The magic of Universal could never be beat; so detail oriented and exactly like the books/movies) Still the drinks were great, my Caesar was good, I asked for it extra spicy. I appreciated the variety of drinks and their craftiness as well as the garnishes."}
{"text":"A very small bar, but their Better Beer was one of the best drinks I've ever had in my life. Overall the bar is a very sweet, subtle and tasteful tribute to Harry Potter."}
{"text":"I initially came here because I am an avid Harry Potter fan and love all things Harry Potter. What has kept me coming back? The food and the drinks! It's not even about Harry Potter for me anymore. I just love this spot. It's great for some late night drinks and tapas; and also for their brunches!   Their menu has changed over the last couple years since they opened which I like because it shakes things up. Some drinks are the same, but I also like coming back to new things. The Shacklebolt is my absolute FAVOURITE drink here. I have also more recently tried the Betterbeer which is also AMAZING. Their Beffudlement draft is also a great novelty. I just love how creative this place is. They have a small menu, but it ultimately means everything is done super well. Their brunch is delicious and the portion sizes are perfect. They aren't too small nor are they too big. Each time I have come I was able to clean my plate and leave satisfied, which is so much better than being wasteful.   The staff here are super friendly and the owners are so nice. This last time we went, the poor waitress was run off her feet though. She was serving basically the whole full house. Not her fault at all but they definitely could have used another waiter. Service didn't truly suffer though, which is a big kudos to the waitress. Only had to wait a short time for butter and the bill.   This place is small and I definitely recommend coming as soon as they open. We went for a Saturday brunch and we had to wait an hour for a seat. We didn't mind because there was a parade going on that we could watch, but, I would definitely try to time it better next time. The place cleared out at about 1-130 and they still serve brunch until I think 2:30, so that is an option as well.   Street parking. Depending what's going on, it can be tough to find. Lots of side streets that are permit only."}
{"text":"Much larger, with a \"classier\" vibe than the location in Toronto. Not meant as a bad thing to either location, just different.   I could sit here all night trying out their drinks and menu items. Kudos to the creativeness and artistry in their drink making re: Flying Ford Anglia. (The drink itself is more sour, but chasing it with the cotton candy was delicious). I just love their inventions, and of course all things Harry Potter.   The Mac and cheese in the skull bowl was also delicious but could have been more hot--slightly disappointing. The chocolate frog -- to die for!   Butter beer is also great with a perfectly toasted marshmallow.   Of course I'll be back. So many other things to try!"}
{"text":"Better than arriving to Gringots as a 12 year-old muggle unaware of the magical adventures yet to come. The service was that of a loyal house-elf, the drinks- concocted by a potion master as powerful as the Half-Blood Prince, and the atmosphere- subtle and welcoming, like stepping into The Burrow for the first time. 10 points for The Lockhart."}
{"text":"Was in montreal and decide to check out their brunch. The service was pretty decent depending on which server you had. Some were helpful and friendly and one felt like he he did not want to be there. We ordered the grilled cheese and the french toast and a pitcher of the better beer. My bf had the french toast and he said its not bad its not like a sweet french toast so if your into that then that might the french toast for you. The grilled cheese with spinach, leek and tomato soup was just okay nothing special. Only slight annoyance when I asked to take the rest home cause I couldnt finish it. When they brought it back they didn't give me my soup and when I asked they guy said they didn't have a container... would of been nice to let me know since I paid for it and that would of been a waste of food. The better beer is not to bad but very cinnamony.  Overall the place itself is unique with all the decorations the drinks but the food is sub par. Would be interested to try their evening menu."}
{"text":"This is a fandom you don't f**k with. One of the worst bar experiences in Toronto. After waiting almost 2 hours in line, we were bowled over by the sparse decor, you'll find a better Harry Potter theme in my grandma's garage. Not a place to bring your first date and then make out in full view of the lineup outside, as people will hate you forever. I strongly suspect this place was set up by someone who was a fan of the movies, or God forbid, Harry Potter Musical. The tapas tasted awful. 100% do not go, as you leave angry and disappointed. If I could give this no stars, I would. Crucio, bi**ches.   Ps. The deathly hallows graffiti in the bathroom did not distract from the grime of the toilet."}
{"text":"Fantastic service between the male bartender we had and the blonde girl who was a runner for several tables and triple checked on us after we were told we couldn't grab a table... she took care of us for sure and we had a great time. I really liked the drinks and thought it was so cool how they were prepped. I got a sweater to remember my visit and they gave me an awesome poster. I'm glad to have visited from the states and will return soon! I may also add that they took very good care of our friend who doesn't drink alcohol with some really fun and creative mocktails. Oh, the HP charm also reminds me of my home but cooler. So that's a plus."}
{"text":"Okay, so, first and foremost- no, it's not exactly a \"Harry Potter bar\". It does not look like Hogwarts threw up in there. It's Harry Potter inspired. Why? Because they'd probably get sued into bankruptcy for all kinds of copyright infringement if they actually used a ton of names and images from Harry Potter. I was a little bummed about this too, but c'mon. The people who are whining about the lack of authenticity are welcome to offer their own money toward that lawsuit if they want the bar to step up their Harry Potter game.  That being said, it's a super cute little place. I had a couple of the Shacklebolts and they were really good. We also split one of the \"shareable\" drinks, the name of which escapes me right now. But they set it on fire, and that's frickin awesome.   The decor was as themed as it could be while still being pretty classy, which I liked. And because they don't hit you in the face with an over-the-top theme, the bar could honestly appeal to just about everyone. It's not exclusive to my fellow nerds. The staff was extremely friendly, and we talked quite a bit with one of the owners, who was super chill. I really enjoyed this place, and I highly recommend it. Just don't go on a Friday or Saturday. We went on a Sunday night and there was no line."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place with lots of subtle Harry Potter nods and well named drinks. Unfortunately the demand is still far greater than the amount of space they have inside (only about 5 or so tables) and as such there is usually a line up outside."}
{"text":"We arrived in 3, excited to try it out for the first time. We were welcomed shortly by a very charming guy - long hair.  After that the experience started to go to a very bad one.   Our first contact with the waitress was to hear that we could not share a plate - even though me and my friend said we wanted 2 of the same, obviously one for each.   Then, it was 21h40 and the mac&cheese could only be served at 22h - but we saw a table beside us had already been served. After eating our plates we ordered a mac&cheese. The waitress again shut us down saying that they had been served by mistake. We asked if we could also be served as it was almost 22hs anyways. They ended up serving us shortly after.  Finally, while paying, my friend had an international credit card that had been used multiple times before. The waitress told us it would not work after trying once. After the second try it worked just fine.  In short, food was overpriced, drinks were fine but customer service was a terrible experience. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Omg So so yummy. The drinks are really cool and taste good too. I got the better beer and while it didn't taste exactly like butter beer, it was still super good. Eggs Benny breakfast was most amazing I've ever had before. Great service and such a beautiful interior."}
{"text":"Being a huge Harry Potter fan, I was super excited to come here after hearing all the buzz on social media. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the hype. The way they did the bar is actually really cool and fits in with the neighbourhood. The place isn't overly decked out in HP; but rather the decor is subtly Harry (ie. you may not even realize it's Harry Potter themed unless you were a fan) and most of the drinks have HP names. They also have this cool drink that comes in a cauldron-like thing, that they light on fire. Anyways I ordered a Caesar, and it wasn't the greatest. They put Frank's Red Hot in it instead of Tabasco, which I think was the reason that it wasn't spicy enough for my tastes, even after I asked for more hot sauce. I also tried the popcorn special of the night (I believe it was chocolate sweet and salty?), which was really yummy! It was quite greasy though so beware if you're turned off by that. Anyway overall I thought the place was solid, just a bit over-hyped! I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but if you're in the neighborhood and don't mind waiting (there was a 1.5 hour wait for my group of 4, and once we were allowed in we had to stand for another 20 mins before a table was ready), it's worth a try."}
{"text":"As an avid Harry Potter fan, how could I not make a stop at a bar named after a character and based off the magical world of HP? While exploring places to visit and things to do on our trip to Toronto, I came across the existence of The Lockhart. I had read about it in the past, but had since completely forgotten about it.   We stopped in here on a weekday evening, and while there were some patrons in the bar, it was fairly quiet. I actually had worried it would be hopping, which is why I avoided going here on a weekend evening. I honestly have no idea what it's typically like, and if the charmingness of it has since worn off. Regardless, it was still an enjoyable experience for a HP fan.   Though, if I were to return to Toronto, I doubt that I would make another stop in here. It seems like it's one of those touristy things. I came to see it, I saw it, so I'm good now for the rest of my life.   My fiancé, then boyfriend, and I both grabbed a table by the entrance. It was hot. Like really hot. They had the windows open, but there wasn't much of a breeze coming in. We both ordered drinks - I got a Butter Beer, duh. They were strong. If you're into that kinda thing, you've come to the right place. We aren't huge drinkers, so this more of a novelty thing for us.   I tried to get a shirt, but they had limited designs and sizes, so I decided not to get one. I had held off ordering on online because I wanted the experience of coming here to get one. Guess I just have to get one online after all.   The staff were dressed to fit the part and were friendly. I do feel like it could really have been an actual bar in HP world, maybe just a little more modern.  Overall: 3/5 Food: 1/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  If you are having a bad day, this place will save you!  If you are not having a bad day, this place will still save you.  Love spells and all, go in and have a drink!  Our bartender Dean was just amazing.  He helped us with a few tips for Toronto and was just great to talk to.  If you are a HP fan put this on your list."}
{"text":"A must for any Potter fan in Montreal. The HP-themed cocktails are delicious, and though you're required to order a food item as well, the food is great and well worth it. Decor and staff are A+ as well!"}
{"text":"Being Harry Potter fans we had to try the Lockhart while we were in Toronto. It is small, but friendly with a great staff. The drink menu was cool and had Harry Potter themed drinks. We had the Butter Beer which was awesome! The Cafe Moscow is addictive with it's Coffee infused vodka. Be prepared to wait, but it is fun once you get in."}
{"text":"We dropped by around 3pm and the staff was absolutely not ready for us. Oops! The poor waitress shuffled her papers for a couple of minutes: \"Did you have a reservation?\". We were given a table with a warning, we would have to leave by 7pm sharp! That's plenty of time for a quick chat among pals.  We are not drinkers, so we took a look at the menu. Here's another warning for you: you need to order food if you wanna drink. The menu is pretty appetizing I gotta say. My only gripe is that they subscribe to the IKEA ethos, and everything is deconstructed. If your cheesecake isn't baked, is it a cake? If it's in a glass, is it a drink? I can't give points for that. Nope. My fried French toast was a tad too fried, but tasty. The cheese-not-cake in a glass tasted good, and my friend's banana-bacon French toast was nothing to write home about. I guess Lockhart is much stronger on the drinks front? Or maybe we woke up the chef? Who knows.. The decor is pretty, and come 5pm they close the blinds for extra ambiance. Be sure to check out the bathroom! I gotta say I am not a Harry Potter buff so most of the references were probably lost on me."}
{"text":"Meh. As a huge HP fan, I was pretty disappointed in this bar. We waited outside for about an hour and even though we had been there first they took  a lot of groups in front of us, which we weren't offended by, we weren't in a rush, but it just took way longer to walk in then it should have. There's very few drinks that are HP themed. Not much else is themed. Kinda seems like it's really for casual fans of the movies, not as exciting as the hype would suggest. I got the \"obscure\" reference but the free drink promo was over. The drinks/food were pretty overpriced for what they were so my BF and I left and went to Green Room."}
{"text":"Last night I met a social Group I'm a Member of at the venue as it was the meeting p;ace/starting point for a bar Crawl Event we were doing in the neighbourhood.  As the venue doesn't open until 5 pm on Sat. our Group waited outside, then the Group Organizer was able to get us in shortly before they opened.  Once open, it quickly became quite full with other patrons.  Our Group Organizer arranged for all of us to share 2 pitchers of Befuddlement Draft and 1 pitcher of BetterBeer, which were the venue's 2 sharing cocktails choices on their menu.  At least several others and I found both to be quite flavourful and enjoyable.  None of us had any food there but I did check their menu and several of the choices looked unique and interesting.  The Lockhart turned out to be a small but quaint venue with character and interesting, unique decorations.  I'd like to go back sometime to try one or more of their food choices and/or one of their beers on offer."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at The Lockhart.  It's the first time I've been there.  I ordered Chicken & Waffles.  It was good.  The waffles were different than I've had before.  There were definitely herbs in them and they were quite hearty and substantial.  The chicken was tasty and the sauce and apples were sweet.  The servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Execution of Harry Potter theme 100%  All of the decor and drinks are Harry Potter themed, but the drinks are a little bit on the expensive side and sugary. The quality of liquor that they put in the drinks is great, but way too much sugar additives. The drink that we got was presented to us like a brewing cauldron, but we couldn't even finish it because we felt sick. Maybe have three persons to share with instead of two, because it was just too much for two people.  I would honestly just come and chill at this place with coffee and a book though if they'd allow it. Super cool vibes."}
{"text":"Delicious tapas style food. Very reasonably priced! The polenta fries were delicious and the baked bree was so incredible.  Cocktails were imaginative and fun. Service super friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First this place just opened and there is clearly a lot of hype (if they weren't Harry Potter themed they would probably get 4 stars) Visiting the Niagara area from the states and saw this place on Facebook and I pretty much forced my mom into going. They did unfortunately open the doors at 5:30 on Friday but I was already first in line and decided on waiting. The decor is subtle, which in my option is smart. I don't want to go to a themed bar that has wands and pictures of Harry everywhere.   Now for food and drinks. I ordered The Shacklebolt and The Death Shot. The drink was so tasty and the shot was very hot, but still weirdly enjoyable. I had the deep fried mac and cheese sliders which although hard to eat like a slider I found a way to inhale them.   The service was a little scattered but hey this place has been open a week. Everyone that worked their was very friendly, especially the owners. If I lived in the area is frequent after the hype slows down."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cool Harry Potter themed decorations and tasty drinks. We got \"the marauder\" which is a giant shared drink that the bartender lit on fire when serving to us. Tasted great! Lots of photo ops in here too if you're a HP fan :)"}
{"text":"The infamous 'Harry Potter' bat. Before I talk about anything, I would like to clarify its NOT exactly a Harry Potter themed bar. It's a bar with a few Harry Potter themed drinks (e.g. Gin Weasley) and some HP decorations. I am saying this because I have heard die hard HP fans travelling here from another country just to check this place out and get disappointed. They should be going to Harry Potter World instead of this!  I decided to check this place out still since i was in town and a few friends wanted to check it out so why not? (Im Harry Potter fan anyways). We went on a saturday and I thought the wait would be pretty bad (from reading other Yelp reviews) but somehow we got lucky and there was 1 table left for us! As we were there, a few groups showed up and left realizing it was full.   As I mentioned before, they got a few HP themed drinks. I myself got the Gin Weasley. As the name suggests, it's gin. But what's 'Weasley' about it? It has a hint of orange! It wasn't anything too special. My friends got the Befuddlement draft. It was cool cause it was a big jar with 2 shot glasses atttached together in the drink where the top shot glass was lit up. We had to blow out the flames, detach the 2 shot glasses and pour the drinks in and stir like we are stiring potions. It was one of those sweet cocktails with blue curacao that's easy to drink. I liked it cause I'm a fan of blue curacao. My friend also got this shot called The Dementor's Kiss. Sounds deadly eh? It is. Cause it's literally ghost pepper infused tequila. I took a tiny zip and it immediately burned my whole mouth and throat. But I applaud their efforts in depicting who a Dementor's kiss would be like!  Food wise, they have a daily special popcorn everyday. When we were there it was rosemary butter popcorn with colorado trail mix. Was not a big fan of the trail mix but really enjoyed the rosemary butter. It was like syrup and we ate it non stop.   Overall, twas a nice experience there. I think people would enjoy this place regardless if they are HP fans or not. Their drinks are definitely unique and creative and they were all pretty good. The only thing is that they are located 10+ streetcar stops west of Eatons centre which is in the middle of nowhere. I would definitely go back again if it was in a better location."}
{"text":"While this place is certainly somewhere you should stop in Toronto if you have extra time, it doesn't need to be on the must do list. My daughter chose it simply for the Harry Potter theme as I'm sure that's what brings in the most clientele. It's tiny, and decorated very well with many nods to the series, however they no longer serve food, there was one bartender and it was certainly overpriced, I'm sure you are paying for the atmosphere. I ordered the butter beer and my daughter ordered the mocktail version. It was quite tasty but one was enough. My daughter was disappointed in hers, she said it was nothing like the one she had in Universal a few months ago. Big bonus, they had purse/coat hooks under the bar, every place should have those!"}
{"text":"It's weird that you have to order food in order to drink. Is that a Montreal thing? I've never heard of it in Toronto.  Regardless, we wanted to try the drinks so we ended up ordering two plates. The eggplant dip and the jerk cauliflower.  Eggplant dip was too acidic, the lime was overpowering. They only give you 4 pieces of celery, 4 carrots and 4 pita squares to dip, and there was half the dip left over at the end, even the waitress said this was her least favourite dish. The jerk cauliflower was also weird, I was expecting something crispy with lots of sauce, but the cauliflower was over cooked, the grilled lettuce was scarce, and again, the sauce is overpowered by lime, I was expecting savoury. Needless to say, would not come back here for food.  The drinks however were very good, it's quite pricy but being a HP fan, just wanted to try it, both the better beer and the flying Arnold were so good.  Will try the Lockhart in Toronto as I doubt they make you order food to drink and I think prices might be mildly cheaper."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, terrific service, and delicious drinks. This is a great get together spot, a place that feels both intimate and welcoming at the same time. It's a little small though, so getting a table might be difficult at times."}
{"text":"Decent, solid, semi-hipster bar, which - like most reviewers before me have mentioned - is not fully Harry Potter-fied. We went in on a Saturday evening around 6pm, circled the small venue, and walked out because no seats were available. While standing in the cold in front of the bar for 5 mins trying to decide what to do next, the waitress comes out and suggests that we walk around the area and come back later. It was then that 2 people walked out and we got in. Lucky for us, because lol to be honest, I'm not sure what else we could visit in that area.  For the Harry Potter fans, I saw only 3 items on the drinks menu that were HP-themed: Ludo's Debt (gin-based), the Shacklebolt (rum-based), and the Befuddlement Draft (bucket-based). In addition, there was a special on the wall called 'Gin Weasley.' I had a Ludo's Debt and there was a bit too much gin in the mix. Tapas: we got the tempura shrimp, and LOL it was 5 skewers for $10. Pricey!  Too much HP hype of this place had risen my expectations beyond what this bar could deliver. Solid bar overall, but lots of other comparable places to chose from in Tdot."}
{"text":"For anyone who enjoys Harry Potter, this is a very cool experience. Great atmosphere. You will love it! Friendly staff."}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped through the curtains past the door, we knew this would be a special place. The atmosphere is well executed Harry Potter without being kitschy. The waiters were warm and welcoming and even saved a table for us because they knew we were so eager to be there. Drinks all around 10-12 dollars. All of the drinks seemed excellent, but The Shacklebolt and the Betterbeer were our favorites. A can't miss for any Harry Potter fan!"}
{"text":"Took my Harry Potter nerd to this spot and it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. But it could be great with a little better institutionalizing of the cooperation between the back and front of house and more attention to detail.   The gimmick is cool. Cozy spot, nice decor, but way WAY too cramped for brunch. There are only 5 tables and a high top. 3 of the tables are 2 seats but they try to stuff 5 people on them. The real magic here is figuring out how to eat without jamming your elbow in your dining companion's eye socket at every bite of eggs Benny.   The bar needs to be stronger. For the \"Better Beer\" (tasty, btw) they use old antique cocktail classes, which is cool, but don't seem to want to wash them properly. Using the bar rail rinser is not washing a used cup in my book. Also I saw the bartender make a \"Lockhart Caesar\" and it was a lazy one. Just vodka, Worcestershire sauce, sriracha. and Walter's mix with a couple picked carrot sticks on top. No salt, no horseradish, no guff. I feel like if you're going to name a drink after your bar, there should be something unique about it. Using Walters is kind of a shortcut. Food presentation is a bit, uh.... spartan, but the food itself is good.   The serving staff are very nice and as accommodating as possible.  I think they are doing their best to manage the reality of being in a hole in the wall sized place while learning the ropes of owning a restaurant. It's a tough biz. They know they need a bigger dining room but i fully understand that it's easier said than done, so can't really fault them for that.   Although the above review probably sounds harsh it's meant as constructive criticism. I think Lockhart could be a top brunch spot in the city for those looking for a little magic in their day."}
{"text":"If you are a potter head or even just enjoy good drinks, come to The Lockhart ! All of the drinks are Harry Potter themed, from butterbeer to potions and famous characters. Each drink is carefully crafted and presentation is definitely a 10. I tried The Botanist and Ludo's Debt. While The Botanist was good, I thoroughly enjoyed Ludo's Debt and would definitely order it again !   The space is cute with pictures and quotes decorating the walls. I went on a Friday night with one other person and the place was busy but not crowded, which surprised me."}
{"text":"My friends and I ventured to Toronto for a Sunday getaway and this was our first stop after reading all the hype. It wasn't as over the top as I'd imagined but definitely a unique spot. There's enough subtle references to keep any Harry Potter fan interested but just don't think you're going to walk into Hogwarts itself. The food was delicious and reasonable (highly recommend the eggs benedict)."}
{"text":"Come for the fan squealing memorabilia and stay for the potions (drinks) because they will knock you off your broomstick.   When my gf came to visit, we had to take a road trip to check out the spot. Located right next to China town, this tiny pub is packed with HP references from the books and movies. I'll be honest, when we first walked in, we sat in silence for about 10 minutes just staring and observing all that was around us. They've got toys, posters, gadgets, jokes, and a photo opps all over.   We came for brunch, which starts up at 10:30 in Saturday's and Sunday's. It was good. Not amazing, but good. Honestly it was just food to eat while we stared at the walls. If you're going to come here, I'd recommend coming on one of their special event nights or for dinner. That's when you get the full magical experience.   Most folks will come for the potions, which were frankly a little steep. I would have liked to see some more variety between the prices so we could indulge in a few. For the sake of getting something, my gf did get a chocolate frog which was puny.   I'd recommend checking it out, but maybe brunch wasn't the best time to do it."}
{"text":"Same as a lot of reviews here.. my expectation for this place was way too high.   I guess I was almost expecting a Harry Potter themed park...? Lol... none of that happened obviously.. that's okay I should've done my reserch.  Old fashioned was terrible... the burbon didn't taste right... and it was way too sweet and thick for my liking. The Margarita was A-ok.   The space is smaller than I expected.. not a lot of seatings and please do come early coz there will be a giant lineup!   This place is more like a one time visit kinda thing and I probably wouldn't come back. There are lots of cocktail places around the neighbourhood that serve better drinks."}
{"text":"We decided that The Lockhart was an absolute must on our trip to Toronto, and it did not disappoint! Our bartender was attentive, helpful, and an absolute delight. There were so many drink options, but we finally settled on the Betterbeer and the Botanist. Both were delicious and presented beautifully. The decor of the bar is very tasteful and represents Harry Potter well. I would highly recommend this to all people, Harry Potter fans or not."}
{"text":"Les deux étoiles sont pour le service (sympatique) et les drinks. Ceux-ci étaient très bons et originaux !   Les étoiles en moins sont pour : - l'ambiance (aucune),  - la nourriture. Je comprends qu'il faut se conformer au permis mais c'est très cher pour le peu qu'il y avait dans l'assiette... et leurs crevettes tièdes n'étaient pas un succès,  - l'absence de la vibe harry potter. Il est normal qu'ils doivent se conformer aux droits d'auteurs etc, mais à part être une stratégie marketing pour la promo de leur bar par le bouche-à-oreille, je ne vois pas en quoi le lieu était représentatif de l'esprit de la série.  - la musique : on aurait dit un \"top 40\" tiré du site 8tracks."}
{"text":"If you're a diehard HP fan : don't get your hopes up. The place is cute, there are owls, a hypogryph head, herbs and stuff, but it's all veeery light. I found the place to be really dark and loud. The food is pretty bad. The prices are high, the portions are small, we had dips and the Herboristerie 101 : not good. The honey cake is good though. I liked the drinks. The service was average. It seemed like our waitress would like to be anywhere else but here. Two stars for the cutsie place (again diehard fans - not for you), the nice drinks and the good cake."}
{"text":"Was so excited to go to The Lockhart since our recent move to Toronto & we weren't disappointed! The service and food were great! Best eggs Benny we've had. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"We had the most incredible time. We were a group of 8. We got a reservation at the bar and I have never seen a more talented and creative bartender. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday. They had an amazing non-alcoholic menu. The food was delicious. We ordered the pizza, beet salad, jerk cauliflower. Kids all had the French toast which was a huge hit. It was with bananas, peanut butter and topped with bacon.   Highly recommend for a night out. The music and decor was on point."}
{"text":"Harry Potter themed bar that's very well executed with a fairly reasonable price range for drinks. Gets pretty packed, but there is a standing bar where you can drink while waiting for a seat at the sitting bar. The waitress tells everyone to wait for her to be moved to the sitting bar when seats open up. This is nice because it prevents people from stealing seats from others who have been waiting longer.   I tried two of their most popular drinks- the shacklebolt and butterbeer. The shacklebolt tasted very cinnamonny - if you like fireball you will like this :) comes with a stick of burning cinnamon (?) which looks very campfire-y and cool. The alcohol taste isn't very strong in this one. The butterbeer is sweet and has a more prominent alcohol taste. Comes with whipped cream and a toasted marshmallow on top! I would recommend both drinks."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try their famous beer! but The waitress came to give us the menu and told us that we needed to order something to eat to can order alcohol. With Not many choices to eat, we decide fast but we waited for more than 20 minutes and she never came back to ask for our orders. The place was almost empty but she was quite busy with the only full table. We left the place and they even noticed I think. What a shame we couldn't try the beer because of the bad service"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and I really love it! The staff is super friendly, the decor for this place is decked out with cool Harry Potter & Harry Potter related stuff, and the drinks are great! It's a little pricey, but if you're a fan of Harry Potter it's definitely worth it. Last time I was a little sad that they got rid of most of their food items except for 4-5 snacks/desserts, as I really enjoyed getting something to eat here."}
{"text":"Kind of on the expensive side but if you like Harry Potter and fancy drinks this is a great place for a night out!"}
{"text":"For anyone who loves Harry Potter this is the perfect place to go. The alcoholic butter beer Tate almost to the real thing. The atmosphere kind of takes you to Harry Potter world. It's a must stop if you're ever in Montreal"}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends. We ordered a pitcher of le marauder  and ordered poutine red eye, the jarret de porc fumé and another dish called herboristerie 101. To top it off we ordered the honey and spice cake. Our meal was  delightful. Great service and the dishes were beautifully decorated. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Awesome HP themed bar. My only gripe with this place is that it's not as HP themed as I'd thought. It's very much a dive bar. VERY cool though - I love the Dobby pictures on the wall - the \"Dementor's Kiss\" drink, the bathrooms are lined with quotes from the books (why couldn't it be follow the BUTTERFLIES? Why did it have to be spiders?!?), and my absolute favorite part of the bar - a neon sign that says \"all was well\". If you don't know what that line is from, you probably won't enjoy this bar."}
{"text":"They can make your drinks and food to look all fancy-pansy but I wouldn't pay a single dime for their food. Ordered fried chicken which came out over cooked/burnt/tasted too bitter, and had some yellow curry avocado toast(?), also burnt! Just fyi, must order food if you are ordering any alcoholic drinks. The cocktails aren't too bad but still wont make you forget about their horribly cooked food    Could have been just that day, idk, who knows  I guess i could still recommend this place to Harry Potter fans or those who just want nice ig food pics :P"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to approach an owner on the spot and buy a bar? Well for me this was it. While this bar isn't officially a Harry Potter bar (you know that whole copyright and licensing thing) it's as close to a Diagon Alley haunt as you would expect. I am a self proclaimed Potterhead (and proud of it, Ravenclaw Class of 2012) and this bar popped on a list of Toronto attractions.  If the wizard wanted photo opp poster in the window isn't enough, everything else in the bar has a HP twist as well. From the Dobby pics to the cocktail names to the stairwell plastered in pages from various books, this place kills it in authenticity.  I actually liked the cocktails as well (The Drink Which Has No Name) and the presentation is awesome! The only reason it lost a star was the dessert menu wasn't as great as I'd hoped and it was a little dirty (which I got over cause HP). So fun though!"}
{"text":"Bon d'abord l'ambiance est géniale! Juste assez de magie et d'Harry Potter sans que ça fasse trop \"Bar de fans d'Harry Potter\". Seul point négatif: c'est très sombre quand il fait encore jour dehors. On a l'impression d'arriver dans un sous-sol alors qu'on est au Rez-de-chaussé. Plus de lumière au dessus des tables aideraient peut-être?  Ah et la musique est... euh... mettons que faire jouer une toune des Colocs dans un bar Harry Potter, ça clash un peu.  Sinon la bouffe est excellente quoique dispendieuse pour la taille des plats. Idem pour les boissons.   Autre point: les gens ont dans l'idée que c'est d'abord un bar, alors que le permis de l'établissement est celui d'un restaurant. On ne peut donc pas venir pour commander seulement un verre. Peut-être qu'après une certaine heure on peut? Je ne sais pas. Mais au moins la serveuse en entrant a vérifié qu'on était au courant qu'il s'agissait d'un restaurant.  J'y retourne sans hésiter!"}
{"text":"I am a Potterhead through and through, so a trip to Toronto wouldn't be complete without visiting this self-proclaimed HP themed bar. As other reviewers have noted, this is a bar. This bar happens to have some decor and menu items that will remind keen visitors of a particular franchise centering around a boy-wizard. One needs not be familiar with the books, films, or aforementioned boy-wizard to appreciate a good bar, which this is.  Atmosphere: I love the style and sometimes subtle, sometimes outright nods to the HP universe. But beyond that, it's just a cool look and vibe. Hit tunes we're playing all night and the staff were friendly and helpful. The Irish bartender was great to chat to but I appreciated that he didn't let chitchat get in the way of him doing his job well. He was attentive and kept an eye on all of the patrons. The place is quite small, with a few tables and bar stools filled when I arrived around 6:30 on a Sunday.  Offerings: I didn't try any food but I had two drinks that were both fantastic! The \"Gin Weasley\" was really nice and simple, a bit like movie Ginny (versus book Ginny who had more depth...and lines). I will say that this is a great option for true Gin lovers but best avoided by all others. \"The Shacklebolt\" was described to me as a gussied up Dark n Stormy, and that it was. Like everyone's favorite Auror turned Minister for Magic, this drink was refreshing while packing a much-needed punch. Definitely my favorite of the two, but both were great.  Conclusion: Fantastic bar. I wish I could come here all the time, but since I live in California it is but a dream and it does not do to dwell on dreams..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a nice neighborhood bar. My sister and I took out younger brother here because he is 19 and allowed to drink in Canada. The drinks were delicious and I love the Harry potter theme. While it's not like Harry Potter land at Universal Studios, it's still a neat and fun place."}
{"text":"LOL... oh how intrigued I was when I was told we would be visiting a Harry Potter bar.  Not because I am a Harry Potter fan at all (well, I read it to my kids), but because I am approaching 40, and not really sure my group and I would fit in.   This turned out to be super fun.  Like it mentions below, there is no official affiliation with the Harry Potter franchise.  Just some decorations, and a wizard/magic type theme.  The place is pretty tiny and fills up very quickly.    Now... the drinks are are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I was so impressed with everything we got.  And very reasonable in terms of the wallet.  We started off with the Better Beer pitcher..  Oh my gosh... so good.  Tasted like a vanilla coke float with some marshmellow hints.  I'll be honest, I'm pretty sure this was pretty strong, because after that I vaguely remember some sort of drink that was set aflame...  it's a little foggy.    This was a hoot.. and we chatted with all sorts of people inside.  Definitely delicious!."}
