{"text":"Their food is very delicious, and they have a buy 2 get 1 free special on Wednesday's! Very clean, friendly, wait time on food wasn't super long either like other places.   Only con is, the location in where it is at, there are a lot of homeless people and it can get really sketch sometimes. On our very first visit here, a homeless guy walked in and started asking us for money as we were eating. But that one time problem didn't stop us from coming again, haven't had that problem since!"}
{"text":"For a \"Mexican\" sushi It was okay my portions in my sushi were wrong. I had one slice half cream cheese and the rest had less. Wouldn't come again but was good for the moment when hungry."}
{"text":"This sushi is amazing. Probably my favorite in town. Try the sushiles! Customer service is great, clean space and order is always ready on time."}
{"text":"So bomb!! Clean place, good food. Good place to take the family for some yummy sushi. I got the Las Vegas roll and the Kuku roll. Will definitely be back! Diamond in the rough!"}
