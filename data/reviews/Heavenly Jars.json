{"text":"You have no idea how epic these jars are. They are seriously the best part of my cheat meal. This young lady is really great at what she does and on top of it all, super sweet"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Heaven in a Jar! This is the best tasting dessert that I have ever had! I love visiting Vegas just so that I get my Heavenly Jars! Thank you, Shani! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family tried these for the first time at First Friday last month and fell in love! So much so my daughter wanted them for her 15th birthday party! Each person at the party picked their flavor and absolutely loved them! So moist and delicious! My favorite - Circus Animal Cheesecake! We ended up arguing which ones were the best! Great service - delivered right to my door! Will definitely recommend and will order again! Thank you Heavenly Jars for making my girls birthday 100%"}
{"text":"Nothing less than the picture! I ordered & paid with ease on her website. Missed pick up time, but she assured she'd deliver first thing this morning. Followed thru & pretty fast too! I ordered Strawberry Cheesecake & Banana Pudding!"}
