{"text":"Very good brick oven pizza. This place would be much more amazing if it had a wine list and wait staff. Overall, the pizza is great if you like brick oven pizza. One of the best place to get a pizza in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Their pizza and philly cheesesteak are to DIE for. Excellent food, moderate price, and good customer service. If you're looking for a little restaurant to take the family out to lunch or dinner, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24 for pickup. Service was fast. You ordered just a regular pepperoni and one of their White Truffle pizzas. (I am obsessed with truffle anything, especially fries). I can now say my life is complete because I had this amazing pizza. It is mostly cheese and truffle with a small amount of their red sauce on a nice crispy-on-the-outside-soft-and-airy-on-the-inside crust. You have to try this pizza."}
{"text":"Can't provide any meaningful comments about the food since we sat for over twenty minutes with the only recognition being getting a menu.  Seems other customers were in the same boat but we simply got up and left.  Too bad since I heard their food is good.  They should try to get some good service also."}
{"text":"The service was good. I didn't try their pizza, which is what seems to be their main focus but the pasta and hot subs were alright. I would go back again just to try the pizza. The cleanliness of the bathroom, however, was disappointing. It didn't \"look\" dirty but it didn't smell clean. This was probably the worst part of the experience."}
{"text":"Their pizza is one of the best fire oven pizzas I have had. It is my kids favorite pizza in town and the two of them ate a whole pizza by themselves! The meatball sandwich was OK, but wouldn't recommend it. Service is excellent and we like the atmosphere. We will be coming back regularly!"}
{"text":"The salad they serve with the pasta is just a bowl of the same kind of shredded lettuce they put on sandwiches at subway. I ordered the creamy pesto pasta which was pretty good but just barely above average. I also found a what looked like a hair baked into the garlic bread they brought me. They told me it was a bristle from the brush they use to brush the butter on the bread... still gross. I was literally the only person in the whole restaurant as well. The prices were great but the food just isn't."}
{"text":"Brothers and I ate here! We loved the pizza!! We are pizza connoisseurs and we will be sure to coming back!!"}
{"text":"floor was dirty, service a little slow"}
{"text":"This place is not worth going to or eating. No idea how they're still in business. My girlfriend and I looked at the yelp reviews and figured we give it a shot, little did we know that place is garbage. We ordered our food and it took so long to get. Large Margherita pizza took close to an hour to get. Every Time we asked the waitress she'd say \"it'll be a couple more minutes\" the salad we ordered took close to 20 minutes to get. It wasn't even busy there. Maybe about 8 customers none of which had gotten their food in a timely manner. After the pizza came, I was very upset. The pizza was watery and burnt! I am not the one to complain or send food back. I'd rather them lose customers. The atmosphere there was gross too. Beer boxes everywhere which was annoying and it seemed dirty. This place is trying to be sophisticated but I'm afraid they just can't deliver. I've eaten better pizza from the microwave."}
{"text":"I would have given Sal's four stars but the service was extremely slow when we went in at 12:30pm on a Monday. There were only six other people in the place yet it took them 30 min. to make our two sandwiches. We waited by the order counter five before we were acknowledged.  Both my husband and I had hot sandwiches. He said his chicken parmesan sandwich was very good and I enjoyed my Philly cheesesteak. Their bread for the sandwiches tasted freshly baked. The meat in my sandwich was not tough as sometimes has been the case with other Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  I suggest that if you are in a hurry that you call your order ahead of your arrival time. Either that or order an alcoholic beverage to sip while you wait. It may help you lose track of time."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  I'm from out of town visiting my boyfriend working in the area. While close to many chain restaurants, I wanted to find a local joint. Well, now I'm sitting at Macaroni Grill trying to forget the frustration of getting a house salad made mainly  of shredded soggy lettuce and canned salty black olives, warm beer, the wrong pizza, being told I didn't order the pizza I ordered, asked for more money and receiving a pizza with ingredients I was told it wouldn't have (that my boyfriend is allergic to).  I understand mistakes happen and will not get upset easily, but we asked for a refund and left.  The meal wasn't comp'd. Big deal?....we paid 15 bucks for sorry salad and bad beer....was hoping the pizza would've made up for that :/  Don't believe yelp."}
{"text":"Sals is a relief to pasta addicts like me. Family owned,  chain/franchise free Italian is definitely hard to find around here.  The creamy pesto was creamy as promised but, unfortunately, you will need salt and parmesan to get to the flavor.  It was a bit bland. I had hoped for homemade pasta but,  again,  real homemade Italian is hard to find. The interior was welcoming but the furniture is torn and out dated. Not a big deal for me. The service was the highlight. Very friendly and attentive. Very fair prices as well. The bear is fantastic as well. I will definitely be returning.  Hopefully frozen chicken won't be waiting for me. That's also tough to find :/"}
{"text":"Margharita pizza is delicous, great owners. You can watch you pizza get made in the brick oven. We have been here twice and will defanetly come back."}
{"text":"The family and I are in town for Spring Training and we were looking for something low key near our Hotel.  With such great reviews we pulled up at 7:30 PM on a Sunday and I expected to have to wait for a table.  There was ONE other family in there eating.  That should have been a sign.  We were sat by a really nice, young, waitress.  She took our drink order but was not very knowledge about the wines available.  We ordered a house Chianti and a house Cab Sauv.  The wine came out and smelled like stinky socks.  The \"Anti Pasta\" was a little bit of mystery lunch meat on top of shredded iceberg.  I thought the stench I was smelling was my Wine fermenting while we were there.  The was a sewage smell in the air.  When I went to the restroom I walked into a wall of sewage smell.  It was pretty bad.  That was it for me.  The pizzas came out but at different times and it was actually decent but I couldn't get the sewage smell out of my nose hairs.  Maybe if you went in, didn't order wine, didn't order an \"anti pasta\" didn't sit at the table closest to the bathrooms and ordered a plain cheese pizza you would like this place."}
{"text":"We had dinner here after shopping at the antique mall. Ravioli with creamy pesto, yummy. Pepperoni pizza rolls, also yummy. Tuscan steak sandwich, pizza, all delicious. The crust was so Italian, according to hubby who ate lots of pizza in Naples. Our server was very attentive, Kelsey, kept on top of everything.  Wish we lived closer, would be here once w week."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! By far the worst so called Italian food I have ever had. Took 10 minutes to even be acknowledged at our table, ordered bud light draft and they were out so they gave me a perone  which was nice but don't charge me the price of that when you didn't have what I ordered right? Ordered a house salad for the wife and I which turned out to be a small cup of bagged shredded lettuce with an end piece of a tomato on top which we waited at least 20 minutes for. We then waited another half hour for the worst pizza and fettuccine Alfredo I have ever had. Pizza was cheap, overcooked, and just blah. The fettuccine alfredo had no flavor whatsoever, the alfredo sauce tasted straight out of a can and watered down (or maybe the noodles weren't drained properly), I have had better alfredo sauce in a ragu can from walmart. Oh but our waitress was real quick  to drop the check though at the end. Coming from Chicago I have pretty high standards for Italian food but this was just horrible. I was so upset by the end I was happy to just get out of there and get some taco bell on the way home. Very disappointing overall and definitely would not go back ever again. Anyone who knows real Italian food stand clear or prepare for disappointment and taco bell :(.......Update: we are having stomach issues 3 hours later and my wife   didn't eat taco bell so I think that narrows it down.....BEWARE!"}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place sooner?  Great pizza and appetizers.  I have been looking for a great pizza place in the Avondale area for a long time and I finally found one!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the entire West Valley! Our favorite is the margherita, but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of them. The crust is absolutely amazing, and the toppings are super fresh.  Of course, no restaurant is complete without fantastic service, and Sal's has some of the friendliest people around!"}
{"text":"My family just had a huge order through eat24. We were so absolutely satisfied with the meal and delivery. We had wings, several different subs, pretzels, salads. Our order came earlier than the anticipated delivery time. So convenient. We are happy and full. Thank you Sals Tuscan grill. Your food is DELISH!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  No kids menu but they let us order smaller versions of the pasta bowls for our younger kids.  Our server was so sweet and helpful and it was a really great dining experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and clean. The atmosphere is a worthwhile attempt at setting an old town Italian stage - nice and comfortable.  The young man who attended us was very consciencess. The food was great,  the Margherita and Alfredo pizzas were outstanding."}
{"text":"There's much better pizza out there.  I thought it was little bit greasy."}
{"text":"Not happy with our first visit.  Ordered a bowl which included meat balls.  Not sure what was in them; tasted as though there was some kind of filler.  However, the Alfredo Fettuccine bowl  and eggplant parmigiana sub were good. We had a problem finding a clean table when we entered and in the end cleaned our own.  Also, the floor was in bad need for sweeping. My guess - this probably is a good place for takeout pizza."}
{"text":"Saw the deal in yelp! Wish i could buy more!   My dad and I went in to eat on Sunday! We shared the Italian pizza!! The crust is the best I have ever had!! We also had the anti pasta salad! It had a great presentation! We also enjoyed that they had local beers!! We will be going back!  Totally outstanding food only set back was counter service, even though they brought the food out to our table."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  I must say this is the best pizza we have found in the west valley.  We will be dinning here for a again for sure."}
{"text":"This is exactly the sort of place that was missing when I moved here. There is a lack of good, inexpensive, casual dining in the west valley.  The pizza is excellent, thin crust with just the right chew and crispness from the oven. Toppings are delicious, I especially like the meatballs on the pizza.  The Subs and Sandwiches are very reasonably priced and extremely good. I have had the B.M.T and cheese steak, both were delicious. Subs come with \"The Works\" which really puts them over the top."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5 stars. We went last night and had dinner. The pizza is brick oven. Thats a plus. It's not a coal fired pizza, so I understand the difference. The pizza was good. We got a large pepperoni. It was nice and greasy and had average tasting peperoni. The crust was crunch and chewy, witch you expect from a brick oven. I got a cheese steak. It was average at best, but at least they had cherry peppers. Usually I have to order a cheese steak and have to add my own sweets and hots (chopped cherry peppers). I read that they had a kids area, not true anymore. That was a disappointment. My wife had to take the kids outside to play for the 50 min wait. It all worked out.   Bottom line: I'd eat there again for pizza. It was good but not Grimaldi's or  La Piazza al Forno. Better than Barro's or anyone else within close driving distance from Goodyear."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent pizzas.  Today was 5 cheese and Sal Special.  Crust was crisp with a slight chew.  The individual flavors of the cheeses and toppings come through for a fantastic fresh taste."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch and had the tuscan sandwich.  it was amazing. bread was fresh and flavor was outstanding.  nice to see a family run business that serves really good food."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Service was okay at best, and the restaurant was empty. Iced tea tasted a bit old, but both the pizza and the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich was the best I've ever had :) will be coming back"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sal's since it has opened.  They also own Bella Luna which is also a fantastic place to eat.  Their Sausage Pepper and Onion Sub Sandwich is the bomb!    In my old neighborhood I lived in, in Maryvale, my neighbor was from New York and she would make the exact same sandwich.  Brings back a lot of old memories.   There for a while Sal's had some very unfriendly service and the food took a turn for the worse.  After I think from a lot of customer dissatisfaction it has turned around again and back to normal."}
{"text":"First time eating there and everything was so yummy! Great pizza and Salad, my son had the meatball sub he said it was very good, must have been because he wouldn't share. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best sub in AZ!  The Philly cheesesteak is also very close to the real thing!"}
{"text":"We live nearby but just never tried them. FInally we went.   Food: Just not that good. Pizza was tasteless. Salad blah. Pasta nothing special. Neither of our tummies felt good afterwards (probably too much grease).   Service: Good. Friendly.   Atmosphere: Just above fast food. Bathroom dirty and not maintained - which means they probably aren't keeping up in other areas. Workers coming and going wearing aprons.   Conclusion: Seems to be a family owned place that is on the decline. Food just isn't good enough to return."}
{"text":"Sal's is right next door to Planet Beach Spa and I never would've known if it wasn't for Yelp. That's how tucked in this what looks small from the outside but, don't let looks fool you shop is. I've driven to this area several times to go to Chick-fil-A which is in the same shopping center just a little ways down. There's so many shops in this area it can be easy to miss. I called in my order for Pick up and they were very fast, efficient and attentive when placing my order. Immediately upon arriving I was greeted at the door by a young freshed faced smiling young woman who instantly walked to the register to ring me up and knew it was me who just called to place the order. There was only a party of three dining in but, didn't bother me much as I was able to get in and out quickly. I was so hungry I ate two slices on the drive home and let me tell you by far one of the best pizza crusts I've tasted. When I got home I thought hey there's no sausage and at $1.50 extra per additional topping there better be. I gave them a call and a guy answered that sounded like he could've been Sal. He told me he sliced the thinly cut authentic Italian sausage himself so, he knows it's in there. He apologized but, I had to apologize because I told him I was looking for sausage crumbles like any other ordinary pizza. I also, got an order of canoli's to try but, was rather disappointed as you can tell from my photo attached because they were the size of a chapstick. I would go back to try more dishes as I did enjoy the firebrick oven pizza margarita pizza I ordered with prosciutto, Italian sausage and basil."}
{"text":"Went to Sal's for lunch today with Mom & Sister. We have adopted the Big Bang Theory's \"anything goes Thursday\" to our own\"try someplace new Saturday\". I had noticed Sal's a couple of weeks ago while driving through the shopping center and remembered it today. We arrived a little after they opened at 11 and yes we were the only ones there. We seated ourselves and shortly the waitress came out with menus. She immediately told us they were out of large pizza's....huh?? Its a pizza place for heavens sake...with the brick oven pizza sign I assumed the pizza was fresh, but maybe not. Even the pizza chains make their own dough. We soldiered on. Sister ordered the Philly Cheesesteak, Mom wanted chicken parmesan and yes, I ordered pizza (they had medium?) with pepperoni and onion and also a side salad. Then we waited and bided our time watching PBR (bull riding) on the big tv above our heads. During our wait the waitress left to make a delivery, but she was back way before our lunch was done. Finally after 25 minutes our lunch arrives. The cheesesteak looked great even without a side, the chick parm smelled fantastic and Mom said it was really good. Then my pizza came out. It was covered in onions and yellow & green peppers....i loath peppers! I told my waitress it wasn't what I ordered.  I ordered pepperoni, she said I thought you said peppers! She then ordered another to be made. After 15 minutes it came out right, but they didn't let it cook long enough so I didn't get the brick-oven crispy crust experience.   Overall a disappointing experience. I would go back, but would pick it up to go rather than have poor service."}
{"text":"I have to give these guys some credit because they deserve it, the pies are great!  This place is owned by the same family that brings you Bella Luna.  Again another great restaurant in the West Valley which unfortunately is lacking good quality places.   We have visited this spot several times and they have a great selection of pizza's although they don't have prosciutto :(  They have great pasta bowls you can tailor to your needs and offer a variety of good italian beers like Nastro Azzuro, and Morretti and another very well known italian beer they make La Rossa.  The style of pizza is more on the napolitena it has a great dough crafted together with a great sauce. I am a pizza canasseur so take it from me you will enjoy.  Lastly lets talk price because tons of places in town like to up charge you on their pies, here however you will enjoy the pizza and not worry about spending lots for it.  If you try it and like let me know!"}
{"text":"We found this place by doing a search on Yelp.  We ordered a Sal's special pizza and an order of bread with cheese.  The food and service was great.  The price was great for what we received.  We will be back when we are in the area.    This place has a lot going for it.  The atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors.  It was clean and comfortable and very relaxing.  The service was great and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Out to lunch with my BAE...she had the pizza, pep, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. Philly steak for me...both were delicious! A must stop for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good just think they put a little to much sauce otherwise great and really fast service"}
{"text":"The Philly Cheesesteak was pretty good and I would have it again but the Pepperoni Pizza we had was a soggy greasy mess that we couldn't finish. I don't know if it wasn't cooked long enough or what but my wife and daughter both tried to pick up a piece and eat it and had grease running down their arms. I had to take napkins and mop all the grease off the top of the pizza which was better but didn't fix how soggy the crust was from the grease. You had to eat it with a fork because it was too soggy to pick up.  Didn't really get to enjoy the pizza so we didn't get a real feel for how it tasted."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter how good your food is if the service is bad... Place has potential with the right servers!"}
{"text":"Fun Italian decor. Delicious hand made pizza.  The Chef Salad ($5.50) was very fresh and loaded with meat, egg, cheese and olives, on a bed of shredded lettuce, which made it very easy to eat, like a chop salad.    Another plus was that they have yummy Moretti Italian Beer, light & dark.  There is also imported Italian lemonade and I saw some very generous pours of wine at the neighboring table.  Check it out."}
{"text":"After reading good reviews online, along with a friend's high recommendation, I decided to order from Sal's for the first time and was rather disappointed. They were out of an appetizer I wanted, but I guess I can forgive that, seeing as how it's a Saturday night. So instead, I ordered wings, which were rubbery in texture. I also ordered two pizzas, both with pepperoni (and other toppings), but did not receive pepperoni on either pizza.  The sauce was pretty good, but the crust was on the chewy side and I prefer a slight crunch to my crust. Perhaps I'm too picky because I grew up in the Northeast, where the pizza is unbeatable. All in all, it's not the worst pizza I've had here in AZ, but after 2 years of living out here, I still don't get why almost all pizza tastes the same (and it's not that great). I might order from Sal's again out of geographical convenience, but I won't be dying to order any time soon... The atmosphere in the restaurant was cute and clean, and the staff was very friendly, which earned them my two stars."}
{"text":"This is a very cute little pizza place with the most amazing eggplant pizza I've ever had. If you've been to the sister restaurant (Bella Luna) - you'll be familiar with the eggplant. But, when they topped a pizza with it they really created something quite unique and delicious. Nice people, good food, clean family fun kind of atmosphere. Oh - and they have Peroni beer. IMHO - the only way to have pizza."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and had sandwiches both times.  The Philly Cheese Steak is really good here.  Had a house salad with it to share and it was large and fresh. Overall a good experience and will go again."}
{"text":"First time ordering a pizza that after you place your order,they call you back 12 minutes later to tell you what the price will be. Was a bit strange but I wanted to try their pizza. I was looking for a big pizza to feed a family of 6. I was told that the large pizza has 10 slices, so I ordered one of those and a medium-size pizza. They were wrong, the large pizza came with eight slices. At least I have a medium size pizza left. The medium size and the large pizza are very similar in size TBH. The pizza was good, a little dry though. The pepperoni with olives was kind of rubbery, but I enjoyed the crust.   What was really disappointing were the wings. I ordered hot and they are very mild and bland. This is AZ people! We like our food spicy.   The salad was nothing to chirp about. Shredded lettuce and your typical sandwich toppings made into a salad.   All in all I paid $50 for delivery and food and feel like I didn't get my money's worth. Also something I feel I need to add, is that the man who delivered the pizza must be a smoker because I could still smell the smoke on the plastic bags that contained our food. Yuck"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and daughter during a slow period on a Saturday night. The service was okay, but our waitress was a bit awkward. Friendly, but awkward. The food was okay, but VERY greasy in my opinion. I've definitely had better pizza and garlic bread with cheese at other places.   I always judge a restaurant by how it makes me feel afterward, and I didn't feel too great after eating at Sal's. I had a sick feeling in my stomach as soon as we left, and I have a feeling that it was because of all the grease."}
{"text":"Got a Cesar and Alfredo pizza, great salad and Alfredo pizza was lacking on sauce but still very good."}
{"text":"Tried Sal's Tuscan Grill based on some good Yelp reviews. There were 3 or 4 tables with customers when I arrived (there are maybe 10 total tables, seating 2 to 8 people from what I noticed). The one waitress did a decent job of keeping up with everyone, even after several more customers came in.   The decor is nice. Modern and the right balance between simple and tasteful, if you know what I mean. Not cluttered, but not bare either. There was one TV playing CNN silently, with captions on. I am not sure why, but I've noticed a lot of places are doing that now, copying airports I suppose. But I digress...  I ordered Sal's Special, medium (the only menu options were Medium and Large). I could have probably taken some of it home, but I finished it there instead. It was very good. Just what you'd expect from a wood-fired pizza. Not greasy at all, maybe slightly overdone. Sal's Special has pepperoni, sausage (I'm not sure what specific sausage it is, it's flat rather than round or in chunks, like it was thinly sliced like pepperoni). Mushrooms, onions and green pepper. It was interesting, I think I had one slice that had all five ingredients on it, the rest were scattered about but in decent proportions.   The bill came out to $18.20 for the medium pizza and a diet Pepsi. With tip, $22. A bit pricy for a pizza lunch, but it was a good pizza.  Next time I may try one of their sandwiches (hot and cold subs) or maybe a pasta dish. But for pizza at lunchtime I think I'll stick with Gus's New York Pizza down the street."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The two star rating is based on neither the food nor the service; rather, an experience.  A friend had recommended Sal's to me, so yesterday (9/6/10) was the day. Read the two rave reviews here. I live 30 miles from Sal's and drove in specifically to visit for the first time. Imagine my disappointment upon arrival to find a hand-written sign taped to the locked door which read, *Closed for Labor Day. Visit us Tuesday, etc, etc.*  All was not lost; the competition down the street was open and more than happy to sell me two large pizzas....  By the way, as of the time of this report, Sal's apparently does not have a website. The link provided here ( www.SalsTuscanGrill.com ) leads to a placeholder page, until such time as the domain name owner actually creates one."}
{"text":"Their 'lunch special' is available until 3pm!  I picked three dishes to bring home for dinner... (2) ravioli and (1) tortellini.  I chose the rose sauce which is marinara and alfredo mixed together.  We loved our meal!  There was a wait for the food but that's because it was freshly prepared as ordered.  It was also a generous portion. And the server was friendly. All worth the wait :)  We will dine here again for sure and probably try the brick-oven pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Really amazing pizza, and a great team of people. I ordered online, and somehow Sal's received a different order than the one I placed (they showed me what had come up on their order screen). I didn't have my phone with me to show them what I had actually ordered, but they were incredibly nice about it, and made a whole new pizza to correct the order.  To top it off, the pizza was incredible! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"A good find while visiting Phoenix.  I ordered the lunch special that was grilled shrimp over cheese tortellini with garlic pesto.  It was killer good.  Where they are getting fresh basil pesto this time of year, I don't know.  But it was highly yummy. Hubby had a Philly cheesesteak.  It was the only time I've heard him swear it was as good as our favorite spot in California.  Good bread, onions and steak just right and proper Provolone.  I had a salad that was a little sad - shredded lettuce from a bag with dressing.  that could use some tweaking.  But based on the shrimp and pesto, I'd try dinner here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'm here with my hubby, enjoying a Primavera pizza. We both enjoyed the thin crust, and flavorful pesto pizza with several filling toppings.  We are always fans of all things pesto.  He really enjoyed the garlic bread with cheese and a side of marina. Next time we hope to try their regular tomato based sauce and possibly the crostini bread. The service was also good, which adds to the experience!"}
{"text":"Ate there last Friday night for the first time. We ordered The penne pasta with vodka sauce and meatballs. It started with a house salad which was pretty average. Our pasta was al dente but the vodka sauce lacked some flavor and needed salt. Our waitress was pleasant and our food was delivered quickly, but to be fair we were the only people in the restaurant at a time! We started off with a Caprese salad which was good. The seating area was small and the restaurant is located in a strip mall, but it was a good time. Reviewed by The Road Warrior Pioneers"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza is so good. Got the Sal's special. Awesome. The subs are really good. The staff is awesome. Owner is just as nice as can be. The smells coming from the restaurant were heavenly. Must have more."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here and it's absolutely my favorite pizza in the West Valley, and I've been to just about all of them in Avondale, Goodyear, and Litchfield Park. I can only speak to their Pizza, however, and have only ever gotten it to go, but on that front they rock. The Margarita pizza is delicious and I have never had anything but polite and prompt service, (but again always take out). My only gripe is that they don't deliver to me."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 3.5 stars. We went with a large party the other day. They had a great little space in the back for all of us. It is a small to medium restaurant, I would call ahead if you have more than a few people in your party. We had a ravioli dish, a cheesy bread, an antipasta salad, and several pizzas. Firstly, my sister ate the raviolis, I didn't. She finished it and commented that she was enjoying it, and between her and her infant, they ate it all. The cheesy bread was just that, ok bread with a lot of margarine (it just did not seem like butter to me! Or Olive oil for that matter) and a good amount of mozzarella cheese. The cheesy bread has quite a bit of room to improve. Good quality bread, butter or olive oil, and herbs (dried or fresh) would do a lot for the dish.  The antipasta salad was ok. The iceburg lettuce was shredded, which makes me think they are using this lettuce for both the sandwiches and the salads. While I appreciate the business side of that, I found the somewhat dry, shredded lettuce just didn't work to make the salad satisfying. The other parts of the salad, the meats, olives, a few sparse veggies were good, but not plentiful. Overall, we loved the service and the pizza. We will probably visit another time when we would like a wood-fired pizza."}
{"text":"I just went to Sal's for the first time and it was fabulous!  Quick service, nice casual atmosphere, and awesome Pastrami sandwich!  The Caprese salad was pretty good as well, but the Tomoato Bisque soup was Out of this world... craveable!  plus the price is as cheap as it gets for the fantastic food quality.  I know I will be back often!!!"}
{"text":"Unassuming and small, Sal's was a place we meant to go for a long time, but just never got around to.  Once we stepped in, we knew they might have something here - brick oven fueled by wood, classic italian eatery styling, and a self-service window reminiscent of NY eateries I'm accustomed to.  The pizza was tangy, well-cooked, and generally well-prepared, even though not technically a classic \"margherita\".  Prices were reasonable and the service was what I'd expect, given that two kids were running the place tonight - (one prepping/cooking, the other taking orders.)  We will most certainly go back."}
{"text":"I have had shoe leather easier to chew, the pie showed up barely warm and missing its salad. When the salad did arrive it was a sorry excuse and there was no fork. The only thing going for the order was the good amount of toppings."}
{"text":"First bad sign is they didn't have milk  for our 3 year old. Second bad sign only one other family there. Third bad sign teenagers running the place sitting around texting and talking.   Pizza was mediocre and greasy. Caesar salad was made with old lettuce and all hearts. Honestly not impressed with it at all. I would rather eat Totino's party pizzas.  The bathrooms were nasty, toilet paper sitting on the toilet and the sink was falling off the wall."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here numerous times and I'm just going to assume I forgot to review it.   The service is good and the food's even better- so much better in fact, we went there yesterday and came back this evening.   Things we have tried here in the 6 or 7 times we've been:  Turkey sandwich (The Central Park). Eggplant Parm. Sandwich. Eggplant Parm. Pizza (good, but not as good as the sandwich itself). White Pizza (not made in the true Jersey style I've always been used to, but we like it!). The IRT (another turkey sandwich).   All items have been great with the only issue being the Eggplant Parmigiana sandwiches yesterday- they were kinda burnt.   We only had one issue on a visit there with the iced tea tasting a lot like coffee (we thought they'd used the same pot thing to make it). We let them know and they fixed it right away, came over to make sure we got some new tea, and then made sure it tasted right afterwards.  We love this place!  It might seem hard to find as it's kind of hidden behind other places, but seriously- it's a nice little place."}
{"text":"Sals is a great place to eat. You can watch them cook the food in the main room. The pizza is great. I recommend the five cheese pizza with fresh mozzarella and a side of garlic bread. The atmosphere is nice a cozy. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Good quality food.  Nice delivery guy. Not a fast delivery,  but in every other way very pleased. I don't mind waiting for good food, but I wouldn't assume this is in any way a speedy food mill."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some subs and they didn't disappoint. Younger waitress was kind and attentive ."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Authentic taste and great service. Great vibe. Didn't wait long for our food. Wings were delicious. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"It took an hour and forty minutes for delivery. I didn't receive any grilled chicken that I paid for on my Cesar salad. The wrong dressing for the chef salad. When I called I was told I would receive a credit with the restaurant but he wasn't sure how much or when that credit would be available so the resolution is uncertain. The pizza and wings were good."}
{"text":"We had a large pepperoni pizza and it was great. Homemade ranch dressing was so good. Good service."}
{"text":"We grabbed a personal pizza and a philly. nothing special. wouldn't go out of my way. it would be a toss up between these guys and manuel's if I'm already in the areA."}
{"text":"Have ordered pizza once and dined once.  I would say it's just ok.  My parents also came here on their own and felt it was expensive for what you get.  There are a lot of Italian places around and value and flavor are better at some of the other spots. It has a very casual vibe for this price point."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while on a business trip, and tried their alfredo pizza. It's definitely one of the tastier pizzas I've had. The staff was friendly, and it was cooked in a reasonable amount of time. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good pizza in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in the area, and there's dozens of pizza places around here to pick from. The brick oven cooks the pizza perfectly and the topping are always fresh! The cannolis are a house favorite too!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience at Sal's. The service was great, food was quick and it wasn't too busy. I'm leaving 4 stars because we definitely didn't love the pizza. I had the margarita and it was big pieces of spinach on top that look like it had been thrown on. Overall I wasn't impressed. My husband isn't as picky and thought it was fine but  I don't think we'll be back considering all the other better options in our area."}
{"text":"A solid \"good\" on the pizza scale. Was looking for a quick pizza and soda. The server recommended the personal pizza and I accepted. Added some pepperoni, olives, green pepper and sausage for good measure.  Served promptly, looked appetizing and found it to be good to very good, although a bit undercooked. 9\" pizza was just enough for a one person lunch, Individual toppings were distinguishable, crust was nice (although as I mentioned, a bit undercooked). but all in all, a place I will visit again. The pizza and a drink was about $ 9.00, good price for a good quality meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I just finished our Margherita pizza!  I was craving some anchovies and black olives on top and they accommodated my request.  We ordered two of the dinner salads and they were the perfect size and flavor to go with the meal.  The pizza is authentic wood fire pizza and not perfectly round in shape which was another plus for us.  Absolutely perfect meal!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really adorable. We had originally gone to the sister restaurant for \"pizza\", which they didn't have. We're so glad, because, for the price, you really can't beat this place. The pizza is PERFECT, not too thin (I'm sorry my idea of pizza is not phyllo dough with some mozzarella splattered here and there) and not too thick (a moment on the lips, a lifetime on these freakin hips!). My husband is Italian & has grown up with an Italian mom making homemade pizza his whole life, he was very impressed. Quality mozzarella, homemade tomato sauce with the right amount of herbs. The Caesar salad was well done, the right amount of dressing, I could taste anchovies but not overwhelmingly so, and the lettuce was crisp & fresh. My only suggestion - add some garlicky croutons. This is the best part, though. If you have kids, there is a\"VIP\" room for them, complete with cartoons and video games, amazing! We sat & enjoyed our chianti while the little rugrats were engrossed in a show. You can't beat that precious bit of paradise."}
{"text":"Great Lunch  Sal's Tuscan Grill was a great little find, what took me so long to come here. The food at Sal's is fresh and so flavorful and customer service is great. This was our first visit to Sal's Tuscan Grill, so we were unsure on what to order. We finally decided on a Philly cheese steak sandwich, pizza, and Greek salad  The pizza was very tasty. The pizza crust is amazing, crisp and chewy andvis cooked in a real brick oven over red oak.  The salads are loaded with fresh ingredients and the dressings taste as if it were homemade.  I look forward to going back to try the subs. Sal's offers all the traditional favorites, meatball, eggplant parm, sausage and peppers, there is something to satisfy everyone's taste. We will be heading back to Sal's in the near future for sure.    Great food and customer service, at wallet-friendly prices what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Just had the Eggplant Parma Sandwich and it was DELICIOUS!!! And their Mediterranean Salad is pretty good too. Highly recommend Sal's if you want the REAL thing!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighbourhood place in an area where chains dominate.  Great pics and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Small place but I must say as far as quality of food and service goes I was very impressed we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Here's what I learned from my journey to Sal's:  1.  When your husband commits to meeting his cousin for dinner who is in town for business, get an address of where he is staying before looking for restaurants, because when your husband says Glendale, he really means Avondale.  2.  Expect that many of the area restaurants close at 8 pm.  Sal's was the welcome exception.  3.  Do not, I repeat, do not follow GPS from Scottsdale, unless you like a half dozen unnecessary freeway changes.  Why the hell did I need to get on I-17 or State Rt 143?  4.  Skip all the research and just go to Sal's.  Who doesn't like a good wood-fired pizza?  5.  Order Sal's Special Pizza...pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Something for everyone.  6.  Do not stuff as much pizza in as humanly possible, as they will box up the leftovers.  Skip my advice, and it's a long ride back to Scottsdale.  If I lived in the area, Sal's would be a go-to spot for me!"}
{"text":"we are an army family travelling to our next duty station and ordered Sals after reading great reviews on yelp. while stopping overnight in the area.  THE BEST PIZZA EVER!!!!  i ordered the neapolitan pizza and my hubby had wings...just amazing!!!  love this place, everyone needs to check the pizza out because they KNOW what REAL pie is!!!"}
{"text":"Holy heck this place is a hidden gem! Super fresh, delicious, and great atmosphere! I recommend the truffle pizza and the caprese. Haven't had a chance to try the philly cheese steaks but that's next on my list! The quality of the food is very high and it's priced great."}
{"text":"Good food but racist behavior.. it's OK I know I'm an African woman. I didn't come in there to do anything but pick up my pizza and leave. No need for you to turn your nose up at me act surprised when you see me ignore me and treat me differently."}
{"text":"My husband & I love going to eat here!!! We usually get a green olive and sausage pizza, ravioli and cannoli's.  Their food consistently tastes the same!!! I absolutely hate eating out where the food tastes different every time I eat there. Great customer service too and super friendly!!! They always stop to chat and seem very genuine!!!  We would recommend this you try it...you won't be dissappointed!!! Thank you for the special offer on YELP it was so appreciated!!! :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars......  Setting-Nice looking joint. Plenty of seating for a smaller crowd. A few televisions to enjoy.   Service-Nice staff. Young lady serving us was friendly and helpful.   Food-Antipasta missed the mark. Shredded lettuce and very thinly cut meat, which lacked solid flavor. We tried three pizzas. The Italian was okay but not as good as I thought it would be. The Tuscan was also just okay. I was so excited to see this pizza on the menu given it had ricotta but it just average. Our third and best pizza was the five cheese.  We all really enjoyed it and would order it again.  Overall, the experience and food was good but was just hoping for more.  Tip: BYOR (Bring your own ranch). Did not care for theirs."}
{"text":"I'm an Italian and I'm a pizza snob. Really good Margherita pizza. Quality ingredients and great dough!"}
{"text":"Time to update our review! We have been coming to this family owned gem since it opened. They care about their food and it shows. They have the same guys in the kitchen most of the time we come.  This place is not big and fancy but it's not a dive. They serve quality food and they make it to order.  Check out their original store Bella Luna on Litchfield and Indian School for amazing Italian fare."}
{"text":"Still great pizza and wings.  Loved that I can order off Yelp and pay too.  Go there, walk in, get food, and be on my way."}
{"text":"This Pizza is delicious. Very good I would recommend to everyone. We have ate their 4 times now and the pizza is excellent each time and has us coming back for more"}
{"text":"I recently decided to give Sal's a try again, so glad I did.  Not sure if they changed their recipes but the pizza is really good!  I will be heading back more often."}
{"text":"This place has seriously taken a nose dive. I have been here several times years ago and enjoyed it. The gf wanted pasta tonight so I suggested it rather than wait an hour at Oregano's.  However, this was today's experience: When you walk in, you are not greeted. You get told, \"Just pick a table.\" (There were plenty to pick from at 5:30 on a Saturday and that should have been our first clue.) Then, before we were given menus, we are asked if we knew what we wanted to drink. \"Water, for now.\" Two minutes later, waited comes back to tell us that they are out of ice so it's going to be a while for the water. Mind you, we really wanted some nice Italian wine or beer, but the menus had none of these options, nor did they have any other beverages. So I asked, and was only given four soft drink options. Really? Because the specials board sitting outside the front for clearly lists a wine and a beer on special. Fine. We'll have some Dr Pepper I guess. So we order build your own pasta and a caprese salad for an appetizer. The side salads were average, not great, served on old school cafeteria plastic plates. Then the waitress didn't know the difference between penne and fettuccini as she tried to hand the bowl of penne to the gf saying, \"You had the fettuccini, right?\" Then asked if we needed anything else, to which I replied, \"We still haven't received our caprese.\" I should have just kept my mouth shut. When it came out it looked unappealing at best. Low grade tomatoes, limp basil leaves, iffy pieces (not slices) of mediocre mozzarella, served on store bought crostini. (Why is there crostini in the first place?) Whatever..at least the pasta would be good, right? Uh, nope! My creamy alfredo pesto would have been better out of a Ragu jar from the store. The gf's pesto was nothing more than a sprinkle of olive oil and a sprinkle of dried basil leaves. She ate a few bites, I was just hungry, so I ate a few more. For $35, take your business anywhere else. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We used them for catering for a get together for my 2 year olds birthday. The subs we got were amazeballs. I got food for twice as many people that came and we ended up with NO leftovers. So great sign. We have had their meat pizza. Yum. Their subs....well now this is one of our favorite places. Half the price as other sub places  that are popular and oh so delicious. My husband loves to come get a sub here at least every couple of weeks. I ain't complaining. Our kids dig the pizza rolls and the cheesy garlic bread. This place is a local gem."}
{"text":"Ordered through grubhub... ordered early because last delivery was slow.  After 90 minutes I called to be told it will be there any minute.  5 minutes later they called back to tell me that my delivery driver returned to the restaurant.  He had trouble finding the house so he called my phone number with the wrong prefix (his mistake) and who answered had no idea what he was talking about. Instead of calling back to the restaurant to confirm the obvious wrong number he just went back.  The only restitution I was offered was to have delivery re-attempted (maybe it would get here in another 20 minutes and be cold).  When a family orders food to be delivered for dinner and it doesn't make it, or it is wrong or it may show up two hours later, that is NOT acceptable.  If you want to be in the delivery game, you have to be perfect, there are no quick fixes."}
{"text":"This place sucks I ordered from Eat 24 and Ordered a large Pepperoni pizza, with Basil and Mozzarella at $1.50 a topping and a chef Salad . First of all they gave a medium cheese pizza and then the chef salad had no eggs on it which hello is what makes it a chef salad. I called them and the lady who answered the phone stated that it was the drivers fault that he didn't tell them about the toppings and said we will get it right next time what the f*ck I wanted the pizza now not next time. There won't be a next time I promise you that ; ) now apparently the cashier is telling eat 24 I lied and my order was right so I had to send pictures to them it just keeps getting better!! I'm sure there food is good but there customer service sucks"}
{"text":"Excellent place, fast delivery, and uses EAT24 service.  The pizza rolls are fantastic, a nice change from the typical garlic knot.  Salads are a bit on the small side. I ordered the cheese tortellini in a pesto sauce, it was good, very heavy on the garlic but I prefer that. They actually brought plastic ware... which has been hit or miss with other Italian restaurant delivery in the area. Will gladly order from them again next time I visit the area."}
{"text":"All their pizzas are deliciously made! You cannot go wrong! Our favorite is the Sal's special!"}
{"text":"For those who want *EXCELLENT* pizza.  I started loving this NY family-owned place a few years ago.  I went again tonight and had an even better pizza than before.  Too bad I couldn't upload a picture of the pizza that I ordered (one of the \"Infused\" pizza's with added prosciutto).  Frankly, I don't know why other places in the metro area have the exposure they do when this place exists.  Italian-American brothers from NY (Brooklyn I think), own this place and use products IMPORTED FROM ITALY.  The semolina, tomatoes, olive oil--and maybe even more--are all imported.  The pizza is wood-fired in a brick oven, cooked to perfection and absolutely tastes like pizza heaven.  I am Sicilian and have spent a lot of time in Italy, and I bet everyone of my non-American, Sicilian cousins would be blown away by this place.  I take all my out of town visitors there (forget Pizza Bianco, people!!!!), and they all appreciate the authentic food here.  If you're from the east coast, you'll appreciate it even more.  Mammamia -- perfetto!"}
{"text":"What a treasure!!!! The pizza is outstanding. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak. Although the flavor of the sandwich was good it was sparse on the meat. Had the Sal's pizza and wings both very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very solid brick oven pizza. Some of the best brick oven pizza crust I have had. We also had the Greek salad that was very fresh and lively. Service was also very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was basic strip mall, but the food made up for that. Great find."}
{"text":"Felt like pizza on the drive back from Mexico and this place looked good. I usually go for thin and greasy New York style pies but felt a hankering for some wood fired goodness.  I was able to make and order our pizza via the Yelp app, which was very convenient except for the warning I received that the restaurant was busy and may take longer on our meal. Since we were already really close, we decided to kill time while waiting for the order to be finished and came in about ten minutes before it should be up.  When we came inside, the place was empty except for one table. The restaurant smelled wonderful, you could actually smell the wood burning which was a lovely addition to the smell of cooking pizza. Our order was already finished and it was obvious that it had been finished for at least a few minutes, which was a bit of a let down since we still had a long drive ahead of us before we got home.   And I was surprised at just how small their large pizza is. We ordered a four topping 14 inch pizza for 22 dollars. At least I can say that their ingredients are good, if the Boar's Head sticker on the door meant anything. The restaurant itself was modeled after a street bistro setting with fake frescos on the walls and only a tiny window of a counter for service.   They cut the pizza into 10 small slices but at least don't scimp on the toppings, they werent anything special but it was tasty and simple. Their sauce is very light and not too sweet which is really enjoyed.   I would definitely suggest this place to couples looking for a wood fired pizza, or for groups if you're buying a few pies. Otherwise you'll go hungry but won't have any other regrets."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, only reason for the second star. Delivery was fast and prompt. However the pizza was horrible. The pizza was soggy & cheese tasted like it was cheap. Never buying again!"}
{"text":"Really great crust.  This place is a fantastic hidden little gem!  Try the Arrabiata,  it's a winner!"}
{"text":"So far so good, been here 2 times and the service was good and food delicious. I recommend the sub sandwiches. I got the 12\" \"King Kong\" Sandwich and could only eat half of it and made a second meal out of the other half. Will definitely go back for another!"}
{"text":"I like the fresh taste of their pizza. Don't know the ambience or service -we always do takeout. Preferable to typical chain pizza."}
{"text":"Still one of the great pizzas of the USA.  Seriously. A truly classic perfectly executed pizza.  Not expensive."}
{"text":"A large group of walked in a Friday night about 7:30, they were not busy. Our server didn't get our orders right. They were out of ice and spinach for the pizza. It took forever to get our food. Haven't been there in 3 years and I can wait another 3 years to go back. It was not a pleasant dining experience. The server definitely needs some training."}
{"text":"Be aware if using grub hub to deliver, the wait could be uneccesarily long and you may be better off picking it up.. Aside from that, I had a great experience with the food. Everything tasted fresh and hot. I have zero complaints about the pasta bowl meal and pizza rolls."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family and I have always had exceptional customer service. Delicious pizza, that is ALWAYS delicious (we have yet to have bad food the 2+ times a month we order since they opened). We have even come here on holidays, and they didn't disappoint. By far the best pizza on this side of town. The main recommendation I have is to enjoy hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome oven brick pizza! I can't believe this was my first time here, I'm glad I decided to give it a shot. So we went in and unfortunately they were out of meatballs (which was a bummer) so I decided to order a pepperoni pizza instead, SO GLAD I DID. The best thing about it was that at the end of my meal I went up to the register to pay the difference between the spaghetti and the pizza and they told me it was on them and apologized for the inconvenience. I love a place with great customer service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try their food as my kiddos are super picky.  Their food is amazing.   I had the raviolis with alla vodka rose sauce.  So good and very filling.   The staff is extremely friendly and the food is pretty quick.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved their eggplant Parmesan pizza! It was crispy and delicious!! The service was fast and friendly. Also the beer was ice cold! I would definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"This place is so good I love the pizza and my husband loved the meatball sandwich!! The service is great cashier Logan was so polite good job!!"}
{"text":"Always perfect! I love the red sauce. We always feel like we order a lot of food but it goes. The kids love the garlic bread and pepperoni bites"}
{"text":"Great pizza-wood fired!!  Nice little west valley hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Sal's has some of the best Italian food.   I have eaten at Sal's numerous time and have never been disappointed. I find their service is always great, the staff are friendly, and their portions very fair. I have also had take out and delivery from Sal's, both experiences are much the same as dining in."}
{"text":"Darn good pizza and great ravioli.  Family owned atmosphere and good service. Really a great pizza/pasta joint. Will definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and the staff was very quick and polite. The hot wings were amazing. The fettuccine Alfredo was a bit on the watery side otherwise this place would've scored five stars."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, Mediterranean salad is great if you like a lot of dressing! I suggest it on the side. Not a crowd at all so if you're hungry and in a rush you'll be out in less than an hour."}
{"text":"My husband and I felt like pizza last night, and he'd heard about this place, so we decided to order take out.  He ordered, then went to pick it up.  Firstly, when he got there (about 9:15pm on a Saturday night), the place was empty.  He was a bit surprised, but now we know why.  We ordered 2 medium pizzas, because we like different toppings, and figured we'd have enough for us to enjoy on Sunday, as well.  Plus, an order of their garlic bread.    I'll start with the bread...it was as if they drowned this poor bread in butter.  I enjoy garlic bread as much as the next person, but neither of us could fathom eating another piece.  It had no flavor, other than butter.  It was as if I poured melted butter in my mouth, and that's it...yech!!!  The pizza's looked and smelled good.  However, that's where the enjoyment ended.  I had 2 toppings on mine (meatballs & caramelized onions), and I know I saw them on the pizza, but I could not taste them.  All I got was a sour, bitter taste in my mouth from each bite.  My husband's was no better.  His had ricotta & tomatoes on it, he took one bite and looked at me with the strangest look on his face.  We had ranch dressing (which was very bland), so we both tried dipping into that, hoping it would help...it didn't.  We ended up throwing what was left of the pizza's away...what a waste!    A little later, both of us didn't feel well, and ended up being up most of the night due to that.   I see a lot of decent reviews on here, so obviously the food isn't normally like this.  However, due to our experience, we won't be making a return attempt."}
{"text":"I've had their food multiple times and it's always been average and acceptable but it seems the quality is going downhill lately.  I use grubhub to get Sal's food delivered so I've never actually been inside the establishment.  The cost of delivery is relatively cheap compared to other places, so I'll go with them when I can't figure out what I want to eat.  However, the cheese tortellini tastes like the standard frozen stuff from Costco.  I'm currently looking at a $5 order of pepperoni rolls that are all burned black.  The house salad is a handful of shredded lettuce that is obviously used on sandwiches, just like one sees in a bin at Subway.  In a pinch this place will do, but frankly, they're pretty mediocre.  Anyone who thinks this place has \"Great Italian food\" needs to go out to more Italian places."}
{"text":"Came here for Dinner, Family of 5 had2 pizzas and Sals special and a cheese. Also got the Caprese and Antipasta all was delicious!"}
{"text":"So far we've only picked it up and brought it home but it's fantastic food.  The service for pickup has always been great.  Food is good, only disappointment is the salad, but really the pizza should be your focus, it's amazing!  I'm looking forward to trying a few more things on their menu."}
{"text":"I would love to have had a chance to taste their food, HOWEVER I called and asked if the delivered to my house (which is located 5.7 miles away from their restaurant). They said and I quote \" we MAY deliver if you have a large enough order, because it really isn't worth our time to go to your house otherwise\".  I would be ok if they had a minimum order to qualify for delivery, but to be felt to have to prove our value to them so they will toss a FREAKING BONE!!!!   I will make sure my family of six never inconveniences them again."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, but unfortunately for them I have had better and probably won't go back. Don't get me wrong the food was alright and the place was clean and the customer service was good...but the food was just okay. It wasn't anything special.   I may go back to try a sandwich sometime, but the pizza was just okay."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place!!! Been here twice this week and each time we get excellent customer service and great food. I'm not usually one that eats leftovers especially pasta. But let me tell you my fettuccine alfredo was awesome the next day!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chef salad, with 6 hot wings. Wings were very good, they are oven baked so that is a bonus. Chef salad lacked much to write home about, it's a salad nothing more nothing less. Chicken in the salad is fresh, as you could tell by the hunks of chicken skin.  I like my chicken without the chicken skin, but some like it so I guess that's why they tossed it in.   I ordered a Peroni draft beer, it immediately brought me back to my days living in Italy drinking beer in the town square. I limited myself to only 1. :(  Yeah I'm gonna go back and have a lot more Peronis."}
{"text":"My son and I ate at this little gem of a woodfire bistro and loved it. The food is delicious. Everything is made with love. My only issue is that we live in the North Valley and this place is too far away. If you like a family owned business with little special touches thrown in then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place. Had Sals pizza special. Generous portions of ingredients. Relaxing ambiance . Delish!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 on Saturday night got great service. For an appetizer we ordered the Tuscan cheese steak cut in four... really good! Then we ordered 2 pizzas to try: an alfredo pizza add roasted garlic and mushrooms topped with arugula, and the red marinara one... yummy! I'm sure we'll be back :-) oh we got 4 mini cannolis to go since we were stuffed."}
{"text":"I travel all across our country and have given multiple reviews of pizza and other restaurants Sals in Goodyear AZ is one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Highly recommend good job Sal. I will definitely be back!  Thanks"}
{"text":"My husband and I went about 8pm on a Sunday and they were more then happy to make us pizzas even thought the few tables (they only have about 12 total) already had food. We got 2 to go, pepperoni/meatball for the hubby; 5 cheese w/ eggplant & roasted red peps for me. Both super tasty.  the oven which is gas but they have wood on the sides cooks great and gives you that perfect edge that if left 30 extra seconds would be burnt, but pulled at just the right time to make it awesome. I slather of house roasted garlic oil on crust after cooking would send it to five stars."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! The crust is just so delicious and yummy! Servers are very attentive. I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place using our Yelp deal and we were not disappointed... Service was great, we showed up right before closing and they were super friendly and ready to take our order... Food was above our expectations as it was fresh and delicious...  We probably would not have found this place without Yelp and will so be back for more great food"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp. I must've driven by it dozens of times. We went here after church, the place was empty. Much smaller than I expected from the Yelp reviews and pictures. One server to cover all of the tables. It started getting busier before we left, but she managed it.   My wife and I both ordered hot sandwiches. I was going to order pasta, but changed at the last minute because of some reviews of the Philly Cheesesteak. My wife ordered the meatball sub. We has an appetizer of cheesy garlic bread.   Food came fast and hot. Appetizer was very good and a good value at under $5.00. We couldn't finish it all. My 12 inch Cheesesteak was spectacular, very lean. The meatball sub was very good but could've used more red sauce. Next time we'll order it with extra. Drinks brought the total to over $20, but we brought a lot home, enough for a meal for one of us. Next time we can order one 12 inch sub and split it.   Clean, friendly, quick service, and tasty food. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit because we were in the area and find them on yelp.  They had a decent menu, my family ordered hot subs and they looked good.  I had antipasto salad and wasn't really wowed.  I like my antipasto salads to be cut chunkier bites, cubes or chunks of meats and cheeses. This was a shredded iceberg lettuce base with lunch meats style meats and cheese slices cut into thin ribbons on top.  The taste was fine"}
{"text":"Casual dining and friendly down-to-earth service.  This is one of those friendly, neighborhood restaurants with good prices & good food. The food prices are very reasonable too. The faux Tuscan decor looked nice.  Walk in, place your order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The homemade creamy Italian dressing was really good! I will probably get a pint to go next time. The anti-pasta salad ($5.50) was made with shredded iceberg lettuce, but was delicious!  The wood-burning pizza was really tasty for what is available in the far West Valley. Loved the crisp and chewy crust. The prices ranged: $10 for medium and $12-$14 for large...the portions were plentiful.  We will go back again for sure to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Ordered this pizza for delivery and it came in a timely manner! The pizza was great and the wings were also great.!!! I ordered it online too which made it really convenient."}
{"text":"I just had a Tuscan Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and it was excellent. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Yum + Fast Delivery  Made a delivery order from Sal's today to give the local shop a try.  Order taker was nice enough and got the order right.  Food arrived about 25 minutes later.  Faster that frozen!  The Margarita pizza was good.  Honestly better tasting than looking.  My 5 year-old commented how much she liked it and she's not normally a pizza girl.  They were nice to do a half-order of butter noodles for my daughter, as well.    Wings were excellent-- tender and moist meat with a tasty sauce.  Not really spicy, but nonetheless yummy.    Very good option for us West Siders!"}
{"text":"I was attracted to Sal's because I read they were the same owners of Bella Luna and I like their food.  We got our food as takeout.  We ordered two pizzas, sausage and pepperoni and pepperoni.  We ordered the large which was supposed to be 14\" pizzas.  I was surprised at how small they were.  Out of sheer curiosity I took a measuring tape to the pizza when I got home and they were both @ 12 1/2\".  I considered the idea that maybe the 14\" was the pre-made size but doesn't pizza dough usually increase in size?  Everybody has different taste choices in pizza.  I'm a NYer so that's my pizza style.  I thought the crust was just  too hard.  There were burned edges so it might have been in the oven too long.  I could taste several varieties of cheese and the sauce was good.  I like some salt on my pizza but this pizza had plenty already.    We also ordered a couple dozen wings.  They were good, pretty textbook in taste.  The takeout container was plastic and had paper underneath.   Takeout wings I've had before came in aluminum takeout containers so they could be placed in there blistering hot and with lots of wing sauce.  These were warm with little sauce.  All in all, it was as the rating says,  meh.  I've had better.  Bruno's pizza on Litchfield and Indian School is waaay better and I'll stick with them."}
{"text":"I see others here have had better luck with this place. Maybe I'll give it another shot some day.  Nothing terrible, mind you. It is a nice looking place. However, you walk in and there is nothing to indicate whether you sit, wait to be seated or order at the counter. I finally went to the counter where the service was lukewarm, though it got better as the day went by. The initial impression of the place just left a bad taste in my mouth.   But the real problem for me just boiled down to taste and price. I ordered the combo sandwich, which is supposed to be sausage and meatballs. Problem is, it was 90% meatball with very little sausage; and the meatballs were very bland and kind of mushy. The price, while not terrible, was too high for the quality.   I have not tried their pizza, and I have only been there for lunch, so your experience may differ."}
{"text":"Sal's is a great place for some pizza if you're in the Avondale/Goodyear area. My parents love to go here and I love that they do takeout. My favorite thing to eat here is actually their hot wings! They make them in their brick oven and they are sooo good! Also their cannolis are a MUST! Service is always very friendly too. We will continue coming back here! :)"}
{"text":"My wife is from Philadelphia and say their Philly cheese steak is the closest to the real deal. I have to agree, we get them to go once a month, my waistline won't allow more often! If they also sold fries I would have to give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it's always been good. Really loved the meatball sub and the 5 cheese pizza. Ordered the Philly cheese steak and didn't care for it, but it was more a taste thing than anything wrong with it. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for good pizza and subs."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian pizza w ricotta ! Reminds me of this fancier place down town also w brick oven pizza but sals is convenient right here in the neighborhood. Nice crispy wings w good amount of meat on them. The delivery person was FAST ... faster than any chain .. like ever.. and was nice wi h a smile. I like this place and will try it again."}
{"text":"The pizza is well above average and the only wood fired pie (or unique in any way) in the area. The crust is phenomenal and the Italian ham that we had was not the routine variety...extremely tasty. The only reason that I don't rate this place higher is the lettuce. All of the salads from the house to the bed that the caprese rests on is shredded. Shredded! Enough with the sub topping, get some real lettuce in there!"}
{"text":"Pizza was wood fired, thin crust, very few toppings. Had the Sals loaded with everything but their wasn't much on it. Wings came only sauced and tasted warmed up. They were not crispy."}
{"text":"Always liked the spaghetti and marinara sauce. Haven't tried the pizza yet. But overall it seemed like a nicely run place. Food was very good. Friendly staff. Kinda in the middle of all the business plaza but nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Very friendly, the menu options are great and the food was excellent.  Went back a 2nd time and had a King Kong and it was great, lots of meat.  Will be going back again. :)"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good here. Came in for a pizza at lunchtime place was pretty dead so didn't wait to long. The beer was ice cold. Will come back for sure. If you haven't been here it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Sal's and I will have to say, their pizza is amazing! I have tried other pizza Restaurants in the West Valley and theirs has to be one of the best. The pizza was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of vegetables, meats and sauce. The crust was lightly toasted and full of flavor. From now on, Sal's will be my first choice for great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Decent place for pizza.  The only place in the West Valley to get decent Margherita pizza.  Not the best but good enough to satisfy."}
{"text":"Really like this place, would go more often if they had affordable wine prices. But when you pay $10 for a pizza (which is great) it is hard to pay $25 for a bottle wine. Really should look into more affordable wine prices, all the other pizza places do, Dino's Italian & Greek, la piazza in Glendale, they all have under $20 for some bottles of thier wines.I highly recommend Sal's!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! We had pepperoni rolls, med salad, sausage and meatball sub. It was all great. Good prices. The place was empty but it should be full. Get over there."}
{"text":"Tried the garlic bread and the Alfredo pizza with pepperoni on it. Really good! Service was nice and the food came fast to our table. :)"}
{"text":"Always good food and service but yet another reason to love this place...there is a young man who works here. Always friendly and works hard. While we were there an older couple came in with the lady being in a wheelchair. This kid RAN across the dining area to hold the door and get them comfortably seated. You just don't see that stuff any more! Attitude and the desire to make someone happy is a big indicator of the work ethic of a person and this young man is awesome!"}
{"text":"Still a favorite place for my wife and i. The tomato bisque soup is awesome and made fresh daily.  Pizza and antipasti salad is excellent too.  People working there are always friendly and very helpful.  Not a 5 star environment, but great for a quick, good, and cheap bite when running errands or rushed for time.  You will always have a good experience there."}
