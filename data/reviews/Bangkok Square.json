{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in the Northlake mall area, my review will be limited to sushi. The Gumbo roll was something new to me, and absolutely amazing. As an eel fan, I found the Ninja roll excellent. Had a few other things, all great. I will be back to try some more of their fancier exclusive stuff like the gumbo roll. A+"}
{"text":"As a sushi lover, I am always excited to try new places. I am even more thrilled though when I find one with high quality fish, exciting roll combinations and reasonable prices. Bangkok Square has all of the above.   Food: The sushi is incredibly fresh. I had the salmon guac appetizer at both visits. It is raw salmon, mango, and avocado diced up and served in a crispy shell with a spicy sauce on top. I've also tried the Beauty and the Beast Roll, the Thunderstorm Roll, the Rainbow Roll and a few others. All are incredibly good and around $8-$12 a piece, as most of the specialty rolls are. They have an incredible variety to choose from and many are quite creative. I could honestly eat there once a week. The simpler rolls (Spicy Tuna, Cali, etc) are more in the $4 range.   Location: Their location is hard to find, but be persistent. I just stumbled upon it by accident. I have been twice in the same number of weeks and already have a lunch date planned for next week.   Service: I've had the same server at both visits and she is attentive without being overbearing. She even remembered my face and app order from my first visit. This would be a great place if you wanted to impress a date or friend that is a fellow sushi lover.   I haven't had any of the cooked dishes, but there is a lot to choose from.   Don't be scared off if you are the only people in there, they don't have a lot of foot traffic because of their location, but it is only a matter of time before word-of-mouth kicks in!"}
{"text":"I am glad Charlotte is still attracting new businesses to the area.  The latest to join the ever growing North Lake Mall area is Bangkok Square (Thai/ Sushi).    Atmosphere - Laid back, friendly and more mint paint.  I swear all Thai restaurants must get a discount on this stuff in Charlotte...ha!  Food - Delicious!  While their menu seemed to lean more towards Japanese fare than Thai, the menu does separate all dish styles clearly with labels.  Being a Thai food junkie, I went with the Thai side of the menu, even though the Sushi side was very extensive and looked good.  For my mea I ordered a glass of water (we are in a recession yah know!)  and the Red Curry w/chicken with the heat set to high (just not Thai hot).  The dish was prepared well as it came w/ jasmine rice, chicken, carrot, green & red peppers, bamboo and basil in coconut milk curry sauce.  The dish arrived with the spicy heat level at what was really medium by my standards, but the vegetables and chicken were of excellent quality and taste.  For dessert I had their Sweet Mango and Sticky Rice, which is something Thai restaurants do not have around here very often.  It was excellent as the mangos were ripe and the addition of toasted sesame seeds added a nice touch of flavor.    Service - Friendly.  The place was slow business wise as they just opened three weeks ago.  So the waitress talked to me more than served, which was okay.  Price -   Meal came in at $23.95 w/tip.  The Sticky Rice and Mango is what made the meal reach $19 as this dessert was $6.95.  Well worth it as bad mangos from the grocery store can cost $2 each on sale.   Overall -   I recommend Thai Square.  When I left the place I took a menu as I will stop by again to try some other dishes on their fairly extensive menu.  This place is overall just ok, but the quality of the food is what is really driving me to go back for more.  FYI - This is the third location for the owner.  The first two sites are in Orlando per the waitress and of course our fellow Yelpers have visited at least one of these places.  See the attached: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bangkok-square-orlando"}
