{"text":"We've been here twice and have yet to actually taste a taco or receive a drink. The first time, the cavernous restaurant had plenty of empty seats (as did the bar) and yet the hostess (grimacing) informed us that it would be a 30+ minute wait for a table. We did not wait. The second time, the hostess confirmed that we could seat ourselves at the bar (which we did). But 10 minutes later, we had no menus and not even a hello from the bartender. It wasn't that busy. We left and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Randomly showed up during their trial tasting event and the food was complementary :) 

The service was perfect! The food on the other hand, needs a bit of work. Since it was only a test trial, I was asked to critique the food and service on their printed menu. 

Thank you to the owner who invited my friend and I in to partake in the event!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday's are amazing! $2 tacos and margaritas! It's really unbeatable. The tacos are delicious, the margaritas are good (if there's too much mixer, they will make it stronger) and the staff are great! It does get VERY busy! We had to wait over an hour to get seated for a group of 6 when we went on 9/13. But you can get drinks from the bar and take them outside, so that made the time pass a little faster.  I definitely recommend Hot Taco for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This place gives out free Queso if you download this app! And has good beer/drink specials"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location! Unfortunately, if your palette doesn't love spicy, this isn't your best choice. They certainly aren't lying with their name. I'd go back for the decent service and good drink specials."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday around brunch time with 4 friends and we were seated on the outside patio. Like the other bars and restaurants in this strip on the light rail, the service is absolutely terrible. After our waitress took our food and drink orders, we didn't see her again until an hour later when our food finally arrived. (It wasn't crowded.) We had to go up to the bar and ask for water refills. 

As for the food, I ordered a burrito with chicken, steak, and shrimp. The portion size was massive, but within expectations after seeing the price of the entree. It was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

To their credit, there are some great drink specials on the weekend which earns them a 2 star rating in my book instead of 1."}
{"text":"Since this place is 2 blocks from our place, we've tried Hot Taco numerous times and we WANT to like it, especially since I love tacos.  The staff has always been excellent- friendly and attentive- however the food has been EXTREMELY salty on several occasions.  Think salt lick meets a sea salt grinder, then sprinkle some salt on top.  The issue is consistency- the food has never been consistent, other than consistently salty.  Same with the drinks.  First time there, drinks were excellent- each time thereafter, not so much.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Third time coming to Hot Taco with very slow service. Restaurant was fairly empty on a Sunday evening. Waitress was very nice but service was slow for chips, drinks, ordering and food. 

Food was cold and seared tuna taco portion was small. One member of our tables food sat on the kitchen counter for ~15 mins before being served. 

Took nearly 2 hours from being seated to exit with very few people still at the restaurant. Several people I was with had very similar experiences in the past as well. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Cool place to head in and have some tacos!! Staff is courteous and professional. Drinks never went empty and the chips and salsa kept coming. Good food and good service$"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome beer specials and Lauren is THE ABSOLUTE BEST!  

The veggie enchiladas are amazing.  

Great Thursday Night Football spot!"}
{"text":"Wait staff are great but kitchen is slow.  We were there on a slow Monday night and it still took an hour before we got our food."}
{"text":"Been to HT about 4 times and that was it - no more. Unfortunately in every single visit there is something wrong.  Either bad service, a bad dish, or both.  On this last visit, service was very fast at the beginning but once the restaurant got to about 75% capacity, it totally crumbled. We waited and waited and waited....  Too bad cause our server was really nice.  My wife's salad had chicken on it that tasted like GAS.  Adios Hot Taco..."}
{"text":"The menu on this place sounded great, until we received the food. I gave it 2 stars only because the waitress made somewhat of an attempt to take care of us, although she seemed more interested in taking care of the large group that were drinking next to us. If you go to this place, get drinks and chips only. It is obviously a place to have a few tequila shots, I guess if you were really drunk the food would taste decent. It was pretty gross, my ground beef taco somehow had the same consistency as my pulled pork taco, everything was mushy and old tasting."}
{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte for the past 8 months and have been to Hot Taco many times. We always sit at the bar, and the service is often bad. We've been there both when they're dead and when they're busy. This isn't to speak for the current staff as we've never noticed the same bartender twice. 

We keep going back because the fajitas and guac are excellent. Sat at the bar last night for Taco Tuesday, and the place was packed. People around us ordered after us, and got their food before us - you know the drill. 

Our bartender, Joy, was attentive and handled the situation. The other two with her also made sure our chips, margaritas, and water didn't go empty. This was the busiest it has been since we've visited, and had much better service as compared to when the place was nearly empty. Good crew."}
{"text":"First of all the website promotes $3.50 Modelo draft but when you order it they don't have it and explain it's only the dark beer then charge more for bottled Modelo.   The hostess desk was a ball of confusion unable to make a decision on whether there was a table in the patio while numerous were in view and  available.  The food was painfully bland.  Guacamole lacked any flavor and  the chips were extremely greasy.  Tacos leaked a water like substance while biting into them, probably from the pan where the meat soaked.  Taking 3 seconds to allow this to strain off before slopping it into a shell would help.  There was zero seasoning on the taco.  It's really difficult to ruin a taco but they succeeded.  It also became humorous to watch the hostess attempt to deliver food to wrong tables repeatedly.  Evidently she does double duty.  I imagine those peoples' food was cold because it did a tour of the dining room first.  This place is severely lacking management.   I imagine it will follow suit of The Greek Isles that closed."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've been to (This has nothing to do with the statues out front). Sat down on a Saturday night, which they were grossly under-prepared for. We waited about 20 minutes for drinks, 2 of which were wrong and our order was taken 30 minutes later, despite asking to order multiple times. The food was okay, but not great. Our server was nice, but couldn't handle a table of 9 (mgrs fault for not training host/servers properly). Overall, I miss Greek Isles and everything about Hot Taco was bad. Go anywhere else. Charlotte has plenty of good restaurants."}
{"text":"The tequila was good but it went down hill after that. The chips are crisp and good but the salsa was pretty bland. We got a beef and a pork taco. You could not really tell the difference other than the texture of the meat. It as was bland and luke warm. We also ordered one of their signature dishes a stuffed poblano pepper. Halfway through it was cold. And also bland. Bland and cold do not make good Mexican food. Really need a do over here."}
{"text":"It's appropriate that they're located on Bland St, because the food was virtually flavorless. The Guac is mostly tomatos and highly overpriced for the portion. The only things that were worth the price were the margaritas and the salsa."}
{"text":"Only thing I liked was the chips and salsa.  They charge $7 for a 16 ounce Noda beer which is too high.  The steak tacos were horrible.  Nothing memorable about the beans and rice.  Also it doesn't help that a restaurant that was actually good (Greek Isles) was kicked out for this place."}
{"text":"Vegetarian tacos were tasty. However the lack of service killed this experience for me. We had to inform the hostess that we had no server. When a server was finally assigned, she was less than personable and set a negative tone to our experience."}
{"text":"Went to hot tankon yesterday! Got camarones calient! Shirmp tankos for those who don't spank Spanish, Good takos and rice for 10$! On tuenday 2$ taco go to yes this on a day!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we were told by the hostess that there would be a 10-15 minute wait, so that the kitchen could catch up. This would be understandable if the restaurant was full, but there were 15 open tables and only 2 of us. After being sat, our waitress took our drink order which came back 10 minutes later. By the time she came back to take our order it had been another 10 minutes. We weren't sure when we would see her again so we ordered an appetizer and our entrees at the same time, as well as another round of drinks. When our food finally came out 20 minutes later, our appetizer and entrees came together yet we continued to wait for our round of drinks. The empanadas were cold, tacos so soggy that they tore apart when we tried to lift them, and the taquitos were simply rolled fried tortillas that had no filling. Finally, our drinks came half way through eating. The food and service were lackluster at best. We certainly caution anyone from going and will not be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Awesome patio. Great drink specials. Sydney was great. We had a couple of Taco sampler plates and Nachos. Our friends had Baja fish tacos. Everything was on point. Definitely a new weekend hangout. We will be back."}
{"text":"My industry friends and I have been coming to Hot Taco for Taco Tuesday for about 2 months now. If it wasn't for my girl Lauren, we would have NEVER come back!!! The 2 times before this one, service has been LESS than poor. Both at the bar AND at a table. They had nasty attitudes, and took forever for EVERYTHING. Lauren W. is such an amazing server, we eaten our meal and had a round of drinks by the time we gotten our waters the last time we there before! Everything was delicious, she made time to talk to us, and got our drinks out in a flash!!! She's definitely a keeper!! A++++++"}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo con huevos. They asked me how I wanted my egg cook and I asked for \"over easy.\" When my food arrived, it looked like a big pile of poop with an egg on top. The egg was cooked all the way through, and the chorizo tasted like smoked hamburger meat. 

My boyfriends retried beans tasted like bleach. He complained that his tacos were cold when served. Actually, everyone at our table complained of their tacos being cold. 

On the other hand, I did enjoy the guacamole and sangria. 

It is decorated very festively, but the food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Love the place, but the waitress Shelley was not friendly tonight :(

Never had an unfriendly waitress."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had guac & margaritas. The guac was delicious and the margaritas were very weak. I proceeded to get the skinny salad which was delicious! Hot Taco has a decent atmosphere, a wait staff that is mediocre at best but great food! I mean, I will be back but I just really hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Despite being so bad the first time when we dined-in (see review below), my girlfriend wanted to give them another shot, so she stopped by and got two shrimp tacos to go. She got them home, and one of the tacos didn't even have any shrimp on it. She said they tasted horrible, so I gave it a taste, and she was right, YUK! No flavor/quality to the ingredients, and over priced for what you get. Tasted like something from the frozen isle of the grocery store... maybe not even that good.

I'd really like to see it become a great place, so next time I walked by, I stopped in to offer my feedback to the manager.  Well, I quickly found out why their food is so bad. The manager didn't even want to know what was wrong with our dishes, and acted as if he knew their food was really bad and just didn't care... like maybe they only care about liquor sales? The manager didn't even offer to try to make it up to us. wow!

Dear Hot Toco, either totally revamp your food service, or leave the building so someone else can come in and offer decent food to the residents of the area."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the trendy decorations and hipsters outside, you can find better tacos elsewhere. Service was slow, so slow in fact that I thought our waitress left. The food was mediocre and I found the menu to be uninspiring and dull. That does not include the drink menu, which was a B+ student in a classroom full of D's and F's. Since we waited so long for our food, I went up to the bar myself and ordered a few drinks, all of which were better than average. The place with filled with hipster millennial southenders, who were loud and drunk-ish. There was a brosef birthday party in the back that was so vulgar that they made another group of hipster girls leave. With all this negativity, I will say that I ordered the (expensive) cheese dip and wow. Holy cheese dip, this was good. I mean, like lick-the-bowl after you finish good. So maybe just stick with a drink and some cheese dip at the bar."}
{"text":"Really? They don't have enough staff to serve anyone. We waited forever just for a first drink. Oh yea and we were seated at the bar. Never again. Shitty place. We left without eating. Hopefully we find something to eat. This place sucks ass"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is great, as was the service. The food wasn't horrible, but wasn't anything amazing either. Stop putting cabbage on tacos. It was also a little pricey in my opinion. If you do decide to go, check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I think I'll stick with phat burrito."}
{"text":"Considering my husband and I live within walking distance of Hot Taco and there is no other Mexican options in South End, we decided that we should finally give this place the benefit of the doubt, with hopes of having a convenient place to frequent when we get the craving for a taco.  I held my expectations low because, I have been thoroughly disappointed with \"Mexican\" food in Charlotte since moving down from PA.  However, I was hoping that it would be at least decent enough to take advantage of the great drink specials that they have.  

First impression as we walked in, the interior is aesthetically pleasing, and the music was enjoyable, so far so good.  We opted to sit at the bar, and it was filthy.  There was salt and sticky drink rings all over. The bartender was kind and good at what she does, I think her name was Joy and when asked, she willingly wiped down the bar for us - so no complaints from a service perspective.  

Next, we ordered a draft beer and she politely told us that all of the drafts were out... ?  So, we ordered two Modelo bottles.  There was rust/funk around the rim, so we asked for glasses to pour them into.  No surprise here, they were entirely flat.  Next comes the chips and salsa.  The Chip plate she gave us had crusted cheese all over the bottom.  The chips and salsa themselves were respectable enough to have over a drink at the bar.  But the food was not worth it.

So on to our orders.  My husband and I both got a combo platter.  I had a cheese quesadilla and a beef taco and he a pork quesadilla and 2 beef tacos.  The beef was completely bland, no flavor at all.  The cheese quesadilla was stuffed with some type of colby jack cheese, not the type of cheese you get in a real Mexican restaurant... but I guess I was not expecting that considering this would be more of a tex mex then anything.  Anyway, the pork quesadilla was the best out of all of our food, but nothing to rave about.

Too bad! I really wanted this to be decent!

Tacos el Nevado and Three Amigos will still be our go to, even though it takes more effort to get there."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Service wasn't the best and either was the food. Handmade guacamole was a joke, already brown when it arrived at our table. Prickly Pear Margarita didn't have any pear flavor. Mimosa Carafe tasted like Tang but did have a decent amount of champagne and was on special. Tacos....pffft flavorless except the Bang Bang Fish taco, which was saved by the spicy sauce. Oh and there was a blonde hair wrapped around my husbands fork. Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"12:15 PM (Friday) arrived at the restaurant.
12:20 placed our order.
12:35 we had to ask for the complimentary chips. 12:50 Megan our server stopped by the table to see if we \"needed anything\". Uh, yes, our food please. 
1:10 after witnessing tables that were seated after us get served, we asked to have our food boxed to go as we had to return to work. 
1:30 opened the take out boxes of food and found the most bland American-Mexican food we had ever had. 
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Terrible service. With a 30 minute wait, my two friends and I went to the bar to grab a drink. The bartender didn't pay us (or any other patrons) a second of attention for the whole 25 minutes that we waited at the bar. Once we were seated outside, it took about 20 minutes to get our margaritas, and an hour to get our food. There was no sense of urgency by the wait staff. The food was decent, and we did get chips and salsa to hold us over, but I overall we had a poor experience on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"My first time here was an awful experience. Our watress was extremely rude and the food was horrible. The chicken quesadilla basely had any chicken and tasted more like a grilled cheese. The food at Taco Bell is better. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Not only did our waitress help us but others would make sure we had everything we needed as they walked by. The combos help you get the best of everything and the daily drink specials were awesome. Also a great place to watch a game because they have large tvs everywhere."}
{"text":"Only because I can't give it zero stars

My wife and I have visited twice with friends and both times the food was really bad!  Surprisingly bad actually.  Shrimp tacos had two small shrimp in each. Pork tacos had less than a tablespoon of pork in each. My wife combined her shrimp to get one good taco off the plate!  

Even the margaritas are bad -- watery and overpriced. It's not even passable as bad drunk food.  It feels like that is all the new owners care about - patrons too drunk to care about the food or prices.  Save your money and go to Tavern or Phat Burrito."}
{"text":"I have never reviewed anything in my life but after my experience here I feel inclined to.  The server was fine.  The problem was the food.  I got the Seared Tuna Tacos.  When it came out it was 2 tacos and each one had 2 small slivers of tuna on them (about what you get on top of a piece of sushi) with a little slaw under the tuna.  It said it has a teriyaki glaze on them and I didn't see that or taste it.  Absolutely ridiculous for the $12 price tag.  Then when I got the bill I found out they charged $1.00 more because I wanted grilled corn instead of beans & the corn was maybe a 1/4 piece of corn.  This place will be closed soon if they don't change their ways.  People work too hard to waste their money.  The owner of this place needs to go to either Krazy Fish or Cabo Fish Taco to learn what a real fish taco looks & tastes like for a better price also!  This will be my last time!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is perfect! $2 tacos $2 mini margaritas were awesome. My server was wonderful and I enjoyed the self serve hot sauce/salsa bar. I'll definitely be back on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Probably not my favorite place to go to for Mexican. I had the chicken tacos and taco quesadilla and even though it was enough for me I feel like the portions were very small and the chicken was very bland. Also the margarita tasted more like the mix than tequila. I went for the 1 year anniversary and as I much I loved getting a sombrero to celebrate they had no food specials only alcohol specials. Also the service was awful. I hardly had a waitress check up on me to see how I was doing. Overall I'm very upset with the outcome, mostly being my first time there. My first impression is 1 star and I don't plan on going back. Wish I would have chosen another place to go to."}
{"text":"Legit NO CLUE why his place has a bad review. I'm obsessed. Delicious food, fun atmosphere, great prices, and awesome service. Our waitress Destiny was AWESOME and so fun. This was my 3rd visit. Can't wait for my 4th."}
{"text":"Gave Hot Taco two chances because we really wanted a go-to Mexican spot in South End. The chips are light/crispy and the Bel-Air, a \"house infused jalapeno tequila,\" was good. 

Otherwise the food we tried -- tacos, enchiladas and quesadillas -- were bland at best. Besides the decor, they've made little effort to provide a quality or differentiated Mexican food experience. 

For good tacos, we'll continue to hit Bakersfield or Phat Burrito. For generic Mexican, you'd be better served at Azteca or any of the many Mexican joints on South Blvd."}
{"text":"I use to love to come to this place, they used to have $6 mimosa carafes on Sat & Sun, combination plates where u could choose 3 items like a taco, enchilada & a quesadilla. They also used to have an excellent salsa bar.....Just went back after a couple months & they got rid of all of it, the mimosa specials, the salsa bar & changed the whole menu....for the worse! I will no longer be coming back to Hot Taco."}
{"text":"Went here after a Panther game on a Sunday to use a free appetizer coupon, ended up with food poisoning from the chicken. I was with a party of 4 and 3 of us ended up violently ill. After calling the food department, I found out that 5 other people had called in complaining about food poisoning from the same day. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wow, very slow service.  Expect to wait for your beverage, order, service, etc!!!should have heeded the 2 star rating. 

Probably good if you just want to drink,people drunk, one fell out of their booth, one throwing up in bathroom!!!"}
{"text":"They had really great drink specials for a Saturday evening, and the location is great. But the service and attitudes of some of the staff members were not up to par. We definitely didn't get that warm and fuzzy feeling from the place. Our food was good, the drinks were cheap...but the service...."}
{"text":"I came into Hot Taco and there was no one to seat us so We went to the bar but the bartender was clearly occupied with her phone and smelled like she smoked a pack of cigarettes that I didn't want her making my drink. We finally got a table And the service was fine but the server was more concerned about my drink being placed on the napkin than anything. The food was mediocre for as long as it took. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We dined at this place at 2pm on a Friday, it wasn't busy AT ALL but for some reason it took over and hour to get our food which was cold & it was terrible. We got the tacos which were expensive for how shitty they were. the blackened fish=trash Korean beef=trash and the orange shrimp=trash. Will not be returning to this place. Wish we could take back the time we wasted here! I don't even know why this place is still open if it was my decision I would close it and put a dump in its place, you'd probably find better food there."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of somewhat bad experiences here with the service (the food has always been good), but my last visit restored my faith in this place.  Chloe was an amazing waitress. Very friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place last night and I guess the old saying is true... \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, can't blame Hot Taco\"

Servers that have no idea about the food on the menu, long waits for the mediocre food, gross house cocktails. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed and confused as we watched and waited for our food to come out lukewarm and flavorless, there is a guy with dreadlocks and ho hat cooking in an open kitchen (health department violation). This place has to be one of the worst concept ideas in restaurant history and now that there is a petition to have them remove the statues in front of the entrance I think it will be interesting to see how long until it is closed and revamped.

Definitely a huge miss for the Bottle Cap Group on this one, but I guess that sometimes some ideas look way better on paper."}
{"text":"The restaurant and patio were not crowded at all but I sat outside for over 20 minutes and wasn't greeted. I ended up giving up leaving."}
{"text":"The only saving grace of this place is the lettuce wraps offered and the price of tacos on Tuesday. Other than that, be prepared for some pretty miserable service and experiences. The food isn't bad - there is at the very least a decent selection and the tacos are pretty consistent. 

I've probably been here at least six Tuesdays and almost always regret my decision within 2 minutes of being in the door. 

First off, management - I'd like to directly address you on your hiring choices. Every hostess I've ever spoken to here literally seems shocked that I would ask for my name to be put on the list for a table. I'm sorry, but when they applied to be a hostess wasn't that kind of the expectation? The shock isn't even what annoys me most though, it's the blatant rudeness. I don't think I've ever been treated with less human decency in my life. It's a pattern and I wouldn't leave this review if it wasn't. 

Bartenders are hit and miss. Some have gone above and beyond (by some I mean only one), but the rest have been so rude it's unbelievable. I understand that you're busy - I'm not concerned about waiting when people are slammed. My concern is literally at times being told to order my food with other bartenders because they're too busy, in a very disrespectful fashion. When a patron is being polite and patient this just poorly reflects on the establishment. Particularly when your watered down sugary house margaritas mix is giving me a headache. 

I personally feel that the owners should be embarrassed by the level of service here. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night. I get the scale of business in a restaurant. We walked in and they told us 15-20 min. At 25 we were looking at our watches, with the main concern being there had been multiple tables cleaned and available for a bit at this point. I work in a restaurant so I understand \"dead sections\" but on a Saturday night, really? Anyway, we finally got our table and were sat with a really friendly server. Food took about 45 minutes to get (it's fake tacos) so no matter how busy they may be I know there is no way that this type of food could have taken that long. Once our food got brought out I was missing a core ingredient that separated my \"specialty\" tacos from the \"house\" tacos, not to mention my meal was brought out about 5 minutes after the other 3 at my table. To top it off, there was a drunk table behind us the entire time causing a ruckus and after an hour into the dinner when the bouncer? finally approached and started to kick them out, he instead ended up cutting up and taking selfies with her. Our server was super sweet, yet weeded the entire night. She forgot our chip refill 4 times, not that that was ever a big deal or we ever asked for one, but more salsa would have been nice to help out the flavor of my bland fish tacos. Cleary the management here is not up to par or are more interested in cutting up with problem customers than helping/relieving their employees."}
{"text":"Hubs and I came here for taco Tuesday and I honestly don't understand the low reviews about the bland food. Between us we had the Korean beef, BBQ, ground beef, Baja fish and bang bang fish tacos. The new bang bang fish taco was so spicy I had to take a break between bites (and I ordered a jalepeno margarita to drink so I have a high tolerance for spicy foods). The quest with chorizo was also delicious! Atmosphere was fun although I suggest getting there early if you want to sit outside"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a late night dinner and was pleasantly surprised. 

We parked in the lot next door for free. The place was pretty empty and we grabbed a table outside on the patio.

For drinks, I got the house marg and my hubby got a beer. The house marg was nicely sized and made very well. Who doesn't lobe margaritas when they come out in glasses the size of your face?!?

For dinner we split the chicken fajitas. They were half off (Wednesday special) making them $6....holy smokes what a deal!!! I thought they were plenty for the both of us. Came with beans, cheese, rice, tomatoes, sour cream, onions, peppers, and chicken (with 3 tortillas). I loved the refried beans!

Thought the chips and salsa were excellent as well!!

Just realized now there was a check in offer for a free tizer....next time!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would, since we left after an hour with nothing but chips and salsa. 

We visited on a sunny Saturday. Their patio is beautiful, so it was quite busy. We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. We were there for 15 minutes but were not once acknowledged despite our efforts of getting the bartenders attention. No water. No drinks. 

We were shortly moved to a table. We waited 20 minutes for chips & salsa which came from the manager. Still no water. We waited another 20 for water. The manager said she would be back to get our order. 15 minutes later, we decided we had to leave. It had been a whole hour, and our order hadn't been taken. 

The manager did give us free appetizer coupons to use on our next visit. Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I come here every weekend with my friends and it's amazing! Great specials! Ask for Christina, Ariel, or Carly!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fajitas and variety of drinks. It wasn't very busy on the night I went so we got a lot of personal service from a courteous staff. They had great customer service."}
{"text":"I went there tonight and I get it everywhere is busy. People are clearing out. My friend orders and I order. My friends order comes out before mine which I get, but I waited 20 more minutes just for my food to come out after waiting 15 mins prior to order. I am disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped coming with my friends from school about a year ago. Tonight I came in to give it another shot on Taco Tuesday, and I can solely say that my waitress Lauren is the SOLE reason I will be back. I mean the food was great, but as a customer service is highly valued. I appreciate her patience, attentiveness, and just being an honest individual. If she's not a manager SHE SHOULD BE SOON!"}
{"text":"I love me some $2 Tacos and $2 Margs! You have to get there early because it's definitely a big hit. I wouldn't go just for the food but for apps, cheap tacos, and some yummy drinks it's definitely worth it!!! (If there is a wait, they'll text you when it's ready & you can grab a drink and one of the restaurants nearby or at their bar!)"}
{"text":"Hot Taco's overall rating on Yelp is pretty low, which I think is unfortunate. Personally, I've had several positive experiences there. Now, don't get me wrong... it's not outstanding by any means, but still, I'd say it's good and we go pretty regularly on Tuesdays. This is probably my favorite part about this place... Taco Tuesdays. All their tacos are $2 each, and they have a Mexican beer that is $2 as well as $2 margaritas (smaller than normal but still a decent size). Dinner (and drinks?!) for $8? I'll be there. 

Other things that I like - they recently added a salsa bar with 6 or 7 different types of salsa. It's got a really great avocado salsa, plus some others that aren't necessarily unique but still, variety is good and I think this new addition really kicks the whole place up a notch. Also, tacos can be served on corn, flour, or lettuce wraps. I personally go for the lettuce and I haven't seen many other places around town offer that as an option.   

Cons - service can be a little slow and parking there on the weekends can be tricky sometimes. But, overall, a good spot."}
{"text":"LAUREN is the BEST waitress EVER!!! I literally go to hot taco just to talk to her. She's so fun! It was my friend's birthday, and we came 3 nights because of her vibe!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the weeks since it opened. The first time I had two shrimp tacos and couldn't even finish them, they were so rubbery and gross. I chalked it up to opening week jitters. I went back this weekend for brunch and realized that it's not opening week issues - Hot Taco's food just sucks. 

My roommate and I played it safe and ordered nachos. They were probably the worst nachos I've ever had. No salsa, just chopped up tomatoes (I'm guessing it was supposed to be pico de gallo). Pickled, not fresh jalapeños. The chicken was over-cooked and the chips were really, really salty. I don't know how a Mexican-centric restaurant can screw up nachos so badly, but they did. 

I gave it two stars overall because the blood orange lemonade mimosas were decent."}
{"text":"What great food and at inexpensive prices. Very cute spot with super friendly staff. The margaritas aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"Came with my family (including my 10 month old daughter) on a random Thursday night.  We all enjoyed our food. We ordered tacos. Their beer selection and margarita selection was awesome. Everyone loved their food. The drinks were reasonably priced. I'll definitely be back for a margarita. I'd probably come on a weekend night when there more people. We were 4 out of maybe 20 people there.  It was right before CIAA though and they were going to close for private weekend events so I get it. All in all I'd come back for sure. The service was excellent and our server was super friendly"}
{"text":"Terrible margarita, even worse service, had to leave after waiting an hour for queso. Can't review the food because it never came. Never in my life have I had such a terrible experience at a restaurant. The people at the table next to us left as well due to poor service and didn't receive any food as well."}
{"text":"Seated right away even though the hostess walked so fast, we couldn't find her. Our server was Erin. Told her about free app with check in. Got stuffed jalapeños.

Him- #7 combo 2 tacos and an enchilada. Steak Taco and blackened fish tacos were ok. Not better than their chicken or beef tacos. Pork enchilada is good. Beans and rice are alright.

Me-#7 combo as well. Veggie Taco was Ok. Shrimp taco was ok but tiny shrimp and the ratio to filling was off. Beans was good. Disappointed in my chicken enchilada. Queso fresco was barely there.

Points for having Cholula and salsa verde. Lots of TVs


Glasses were refilled without asking.

Needs improvement: food could have been a little bit warmer and rice could have been a little firmer. Also it was cold to me inside. I wonder if that had any effect on the food temp.

Will come back and try again to see"}
{"text":"Great space, lots of energy, drinks are good and the food is a gourmet(ish) fusion of Mexican staples with lots of other influences. I don't understand the bad reviews--we eat here once a week.. Brunch is particularly good, service is friendly if not super fast."}
{"text":"I go there for the great drink specials, not necessarily the food. They have $6 mimosa carafes on Sundays (an entire bottle of champagne goes in one!) & $1 beers on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"The bartenders had the nastiest attitude, except for Joy. I was really surprised. My glass was empty for 15 minutes & no one ever asked if I needed a refill. I had to ask.  Didn't know about the tortillas until Joy told another customer.  
 Heard awesome reviews about this spot & decided to stop by after work.  No time again soon. Awful!  Told the manager not sure how much that would do."}
{"text":"Amazballs!!! First place I've ever been where the food is spicy enough to satisfy me. Muy caliente $2 Double Mimosa $2 Jump Starts (Bloody Marry in a shot made w/ tequila) & a Tequila list for days!!! Great service from MARIA, her suggestions were on point and so attentive to our needs. Found my new fav Mexi Spot!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the service has always been very good as well! The tacos are pretty large, which is nice considering they can be kind of small at other restaurants. The fish taco and cheeseburger taco are my favorites! Definitely order the guacamole too. It's certainly big enough to share!"}
{"text":"I like reading reviews on yelp, not write them but my experience was so terrible last Saturday at Hot Taco that I just had to.  My two friends and I decided to come to Hot Taco because we were feeling like drinking some mimosas and enjoying the beautiful weather on a patio. We were greeted by a young lady that I can only assume was either high on something or just didn't care because everything we asked her, her answer was delayed like she didn't even know how to respond. Mind you we were not asking anything out of the ordinary. We asked the hostess was there any seating outside and she replied \"I don't think so\"  After seeing the confused looks on our faces I guess she decided that maybe it was best to actually go look before making that assumption.  When she came back to take us to a table outside(I guess there was a table available) she asked another young lady to seat us and that young lady shook her head no. I guess we should of known then that this wouldn't be a golden experience.  After being seated, the hostess brought to our table some chips and salsa. After that we saw no one else. No server came to take our order or bring us water, speak to us, wave to us or acknowledge us in any way. We thought maybe they were busy. We understood because we too are in the service industry but no, every table that got seated after us (3) was greeted right away and brought waters. After waiting for 15 minutes I went to the hostess stand and asked was there a reason no one was coming to our table. Once again blank emotionless expression and delayed response. She walked away to talk to someone and I walked away to go back to my table. After waiting a few minutes more, we then decided that it was best we didn't eat there but we did want to let the management know of our awful experience. After seating ourselves at the bar and asking to speak to a manager, Gabriel came out. You can tell by how he was walking over to us that he was uncomfortable. We told him what happened and he told us that he had just got there at 1pm and that they were short staffed. Out of the servers that did come to work, most of them were hung over (his exact words).  He then asked what did we want him to do fire his employees. That was not even remotely close to what we said. We just wanted to alert him to a problem. He then offered to buy us an appetizer but after dealing with being ignored and then this pathetic excuse for a manager we decided to just leave. After reading several reviews I see that being ignored is commonplace at Hot Taco. It's a shame because we love it here but I guess we have to find another place to get our mimosa and burrito fix."}
{"text":"Been here three times and has somehow gotten worse with every visit. Sangria was horrible: tasted like cheap red wine with a splash of bitter orange juice. That is NOT sangria! Literally undrinkable....and yes, like other reviewers have stated, you will wait and wait and wait some more. To be seated, for (cold, tasteless, ridiculously thick and stale) chips and salsa, drinks, and entrees. This place takes advantage of the fact that they have a great location. That is all they have going for them! 
Nachos were dry, fish in fish tacos had no seasoning, and everything had cheddar cheese in it. CHEDDAR CHEESE. At a Mexican restaurant. 
Lastly, this restaurant has NO kids menu, and seemingly no easy way to modify any dishes. Our server was baffled by our \"chicken and cheese burrito,\" and we were given a chicken and rice burrito covered in queso. This is after another server had to chase down our server and inquire as to what she meant by our obviously complicated order. I don't think it's too much to ask to have a kids menu at a Charlotte restaurant. Our other entree was wrong as well. 
We tipped our server well(always do with kids in tow), paid our bill and agreed to never return."}
{"text":"Long story short...

The staff was all stretched way too thin.

Our Mexican food (2 orders fajitas, one order enchiladas) took about 45 minutes. It was all lukewarm at best.

No one ever checked that it was all good. Our server went to bartend for about 30 minutes and we actually had to walk up to the bar and beg for our checks.

Literally the only positive thing I can say is that the salsa was tasty.

If I return it'll be for the football games by default since it's in the strip of popular sports bars."}
{"text":"I've been to Hot Taco on several occasions.  I really wanted to give this place a shot at getting it right. To jump right in....We asked for another chipotle ranch to go with our appetizer, no one told us that we would be charged.  Upon getting my ticket I asked the server why was I charged without prior notification.  Her response was very rude, stating that \"I would assume that I would be charged because it's taco tuesday\" apparently she's been working in the industry for a long time and this always happens  (from her words not mine) very unprofessional.  It doesn't help that the service is always extremely poor at this restaurant and they're doing nothing to fix the issue (I give up)  Not to mention me reserving my place on yelp only to get there at the said wait time, to wait 15 additional min with several empty tables.  Who's hiring these people?? More importantly who's managing this place to continue to allow it to go downhill like this?? Three people that were with us said they heard the service was bad and prior to coming one person not affiliated with us also said the service was extremely poor (and yet we proceeded to patronize this establishment). I guess the rude comments from our server proved it times 10. With mediocre food and drinks (the chicken is pretty salty and the margaritas are a little weak) it surely doesn't help with service and poor attitudes.  Currently searching for a satisfying  Taco Tuesday spot.  This just isn't it."}
{"text":"It's on Bland st for a reason.  Cool atmosphere. Good drink selection. Mediocre overpriced food.  Chips were too hard.  Tacos had weird flavors and tough, fatty beef.  Black beans were very salty.

I had the asada taco and the korean bbq taco.  The beef was flavorless, tough and chewy, and I had multiple pieces that were just straight up fat. The asada taco was essentially meat on top of american coleslaw that was not as good as what you get at most fast food restaurants.  The Korean taco was clearly the same beef but with a sickeningly sweet bbq sauce (no korean aspect to it that I could see) over huge slices of onions.  It was $10 for these crappy tacos.

We got the queso because of the free app coupon. It was fine but worth about$2, not the $7 we were charged before reminding the waitress about the coupon we had.

Service was friendly but very slow.

My friend and I both had to use the restroom afterwards."}
{"text":"It seemed like the stress test on Bar Rescue... No one had any clue what to do. I ordered a tanqueray and tonic with a lime, ended up getting a Tecate and a lime.... Food was sub par. Not worth it. Margaritas weren't that great. Mine was the one with a mini corona bottle, and it basically tasted like a corona with a little bit of tequila in it. Go to Rurus if you want better Mexican food."}
{"text":"Well I have to say that both me and my girlfriend had our reservations about this place, but I have to say it was really quite authentic and delicious. I have a pretty good tolerance to heat and spice, so that being said the shrimp tacos were hot like fire. But the cooked just right to not make them rubbery. Then the fish, really light and flakey and spiced just right to get the smokey flavor that any Mexican fish taco needs. And the steak taco I had was really flavorful and awesome! Lastly the speed and the friendliness of the wait staff, the food came out right on time and the drinks were prompt. Our server Emily was so friendly and she immediately made us feel like part of this newly created family that wanted to take us on this food journey. (Yeah corny but it was pretty authentic Mexican food)."}
{"text":"I generally wouldn't write a review for a place like this - it's definitely not known for the quality of the food and stays alive because of the drinking crowd. But when one goes to any establishment to eat, expecting edible food is a basic requirement! But no. Hot taco couldn't even deliver on that. 

My bf and I came to this place on taco Tuesday (I know, I know..that should've been an indicator to not come) and we waited an hour to be seated. The wait wasn't the dealbreaker - we expected that there would be a wait since it was Tuesday but it's walking distance from our place so we figured why not?

We were seated an hour later...bf ordered three tacos and I ordered one bang bang taco. Server gave us chips and salsa and that was the last we saw of her.  When my bang bang taco arrived (a food runner brought it over), I looked at it and was like \"ummm what's this?\" Half of the ingredients that were supposed to come on the taco were missing! 

Since the server was nowhere to be found, we had to track down another employee (I think she was the hostess) and explained that the spicy slaw, seafood sauce, and avocado aioli that were supposed be in the taco were missing. Hostess looked at the taco and said \"yeah, I don't know what they did there.\" She took the taco back (hopefully to have it redone) but I didn't see her after that and didn't see the taco either. 

After waiting another 20 minutes for the mysterious taco, I finally located the server (she was sitting down at a table chatting with friends!!) and explained what happened. She went to check on the missing taco and came back with a taco drenched in a white sauce. I took one bite of the taco and couldn't eat it. It was gross and flavorless. 

The server brought us our bill (without even offering to take care of the one taco - she clearly saw that I was upset) and I finally had to explain to her that we were frustrated with this experience and were willing to wait an hour for food that wasn't delivered as expected. She brought the manager over and the manager was apologetic and offered to take care of our $8 bill (tacos are $2 on Tuesdays)

At the end of the day, taking care of a $8 bill doesn't bring back the 2 hours that we wasted at the establishment. I urge this place to be considerate of their patrons' time and provide better service and food. 

In the meantime, do yourself a favor and go to Sabor on taco Tuesdays if you are craving decent tacos. You won't regret saving two hours and leaving on a full, content stomach. 

Sincerely,

Still Hungry and Frustrated"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place! The cheesy statues increased my excitement as we were seated. We went on a Thursday when several of their drafts are only $1. We ordered our beers and decided to start with the empanadas. The empanadas were delicious! They were fried perfectly and came out piping hot. I would recommend asking for additional sauce to dip them in. I suppose I'm a bit of a sauce hog. If it's served with something, I like to have the flavor with every bite. If you are the same way, you definitely need a second serving.
Then, we moved on to the tacos. We decided to split 3. 2 tacos will cost $10 and 3 cost $12. For only $2 additional, who wouldn't get 3?
We ordered their new Bang Bang Fish, Korean Beef, and Carnitas. Warning: when they say spicy, they mean SPICY! The Bang Bang Fish was incredibly spicy. If you don't love spicy food, that taco is not for you. The Carnitas had decent flavor but wasn't anything I would order again. Then the Korean Beef. Not good. The Korean/Mexican BBQ sauce was extremely thick and the pickled cucumbers did not compliment the sauce. I don't usually \"leave money on the table\" but we left that Taco to be thrown in the garbage.
In the future, I will stick with the Empanadas. The Empanadas earned my second star and are the only reason I will return. (Seriously, they are that good)"}
{"text":"Just went for dinner earlier tonight...two thumbs DOWN! Hot Taco used to be somewhere I liked going to occasionally for a meal with friends. Service has never been great and food has been mediocre, but it's been a fun spot. The reason for my negative review is their decision to get rid of their salsa bar. Their salsa bar was half of the reason I went there! I really loved their green tomatillo salsa. Munching on some chips and a variety of salsas while enjoying good drink specials made Hot Taco worth going to. I was very disappointed to find out they removed their salsa bar but I guess it's a cost cutting thing. Not good from a competitive standpoint as Southbound recently opened up nearby and they have a salsa bar (although I heard it's pretty bad). Still, a sub par salsa bar is still better than no salsa bar. I also thought Hot Taco changed their menu from the last time I was here a couple months ago. I was surprised that pretty much all meals on their new menu are going to cost you over $10 (several in the $12-$14 price range). For some reason I remember Hot Taco being cheaper before. Hot Taco just lost a customer by taking away the salsa bar and using a more expensive new menu. I'll only return if they bring back the salsa bar...and it better remain free!"}
{"text":"Yesssss! $2 Tuesdays!!  They have added more tacos to the menu.  Steak,  fish,  chicken,  beef and shrimp!! You have your choice of four or corn tortillas. Your meal comes with chips and salsa. The $2 also applies to their house tequila,  which is really good.  Margaritas and house beer also.  This place is BUSY so either makes reservations or plan to wait.  Our wait time was 1hr 15mins. They had a live dj this time.  Not sure when that started but he was great. We had our 13yr old with us and some of the music wasn't child friendly,  but oom sure she's heard it before. Service is quick and even with tons of people that place runs like clock work.  Fun times.  Authentic taste.  We love it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the drinks were great, they were on special.  I ordered a combo meal of 1 chicken enchilada and 1 beef taco.  Standard rice and beans accompanied my meal.  Server was great, food came out on time."}
{"text":"soooooo good! great atmosphere and service! The $1 mimosas were a plus too on Saturday!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was atrocious. The place wasn't even busy. Started at the bar where it was hard to get the attention of the tenders from chatting to all their friends. The bar was sticky and the floor was more sticky. Then wince we sat down, the server came over quick but then our appetisers came out at the same time our meal did and then she was no where to be found when we needed to pay the check. Had to get up and find her. She failed to split the check properly and then disappeared again. Once I found her again, she was chatting to a friend. Good food, atrocious service. Came for the 1$ beer night, Left with a distaste for the service."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about our server, Lauren. There were seven men at the table, drunker than we should have been, and she handled us like a pro. One of our party (not me) made several completely inappropriate sexual comments, literally the epitome of the pathetic dirty old man. Quite frankly, I'm surprised we didn't get tossed, but again, Lauren handled it all like a pro. The service was timely, the food was good, and the tequila was flowing. Thank you so much Lauren for putting up with our nonsense and I want to apologize to you for having to put up with a creepy old man. 

Lauren's a superstar. She needs a raise."}
{"text":"Great place.  Next to the train line.  Easy in and out.  Great atmosphere.  Great bar service and great food.  I visited twice during my recent stay in Charlotte and first time I had tacos (the fish tacos were my favorite) great flavor.  Great amount of breading on the fish.  Sauce wasn't too hot.  Crispy slaw with the tacos.  Chips and salsa were great.  Second time I just had a burrito but was full of chicken and it was also fantastic.  The beans were full of flavor and served w rice.  Reasonably priced and great place to hang out.  They have an outdoor seating area. Many TVs for enjoying football games.  It was Carolina Panther's opening night and many people were enjoying food and watching the game. This is a great place to go alone as I did or many groups hanging out as well."}
{"text":"I tried hot taco the first week it opened, it was terrible. I tried it again tonight, it was even worse.  The only person I felt worse for than our out of town friends was the waitress. Service was terrible. I would never recommend this place for anything more than walking past on your way to something better."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced anywhere.  The staff seems unhappy and disinterested. Some major dysfunction going on here.  Food was sub par. Won't go back."}
{"text":"First Time eating here:
Korean Beef Taco - was tasty but lack a little salt or seasoning. The meat was cold, like less than room temperature cold. I ate my taco regardless. 

Carnitas Taco : the meat  was the shredded, mushy style carnitas as opposed to tender chucks of pork. The mushy pork meat was soaked in a sauce with off flavor. 

Asado Taco - tasty but the meat was cold

Refried Beans - was the best part of the meal

Mexican Rice - little  cold too and very bland

The manager didn't even come by the table but offer a free appetizer for next time.  Every one at the table was disappointed. I felt bad for recommending this place. 

Did not enjoy the lack of customer service; I am always confused by places that stand by their food alone especially when the food is worth coming back too.

Probably will not go back here again since there so many authentic Hispanic and Latino restaurants around with much better preparation and  better seasoned food."}
{"text":"I went in Taco Tuesday, you know the drill $2 tacos and $2 mini margaritas. 

They bring out chips and salsa to start - classic. Nothing too special, but a nice way to start the meal. 

The mini margarita was cute. It was as strong as I expected for $2!

As for the tacos- I ordered a chicken, pork and beef taco. The pork was my favorite but none of them wow'd me. 

But for the price everything was a ok. You really can't beat this deal...I had three tacos, a mini margarita and chips and salsa for less than $10. 

I want to try the queso and a few other tacos so stay tuned for my update."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas! Really cute space and location! Not Charrito's by a long shot but a nice alternative away from home."}
{"text":"You don't want this unless you're just really craving Tex-Mex and you don't want to drive 5 minutes/got too drunk at all-american next door."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing margaritas... thank you YASMIN, server and bartender  extrorordinaaire! Chimichanga was fantastic.. I left feedback that the beans & rice were a hair cold& requested that they keep them warmer in the future. Margaitas were A++++. Will,definitely try this place again- has potential. . I am SUPER picky with my Mexican food - So give them a little credit. LOVE!"}
{"text":"This homophobic establishment decided to seat everyone but myself and my two guests. We waited over 40 minutes while we watched other guests be seated who came in after us. I expressed my concern with the rude hostess who rolled her eyes and decided to seat us immediately. I told the hostess we should receive some type of compestation for their oversight but she said she would get her manager. She returned with an overly aggressive man who claimed to be the manager. They refused to service us. I'm not sure if it was because we were gay or black but either way I believe I was discriminated against. I wouldn't visit this establishment again!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food because I didn't have any! Just came for happy hour - on Tuesdays they offer $2 cocktails and $2 margs! (AND $2 tacos!). The service was pretty slow. I wasn't in a huge rush and only there for drinks so wasn't a big deal. Tip: check in with yelp and you get 1 free appetizer with ordering an entree."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food was okay and the atmosphere was pretty cool, but the main reason I won't go back is because both times I've been here the service has been terrible. From dropping off my check at a table right behind me to a 2 year old kid, to being inattentive and rude to the table, I've seen it all at this restaurant. 

I've worked previously as a server in a very successful restaurant where the food is great but not only that, the servers are positive and want to make the experience enjoyable for diners. My two cents, there are other better places to eat and get great service at. If this place wants to make it as a respectable restaurant in Charlotte, get new servers who don't bring down the atmosphere and who actually care about making money."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new, and I get that, but it was a huge disappointment. 

I live in an apartment across the street so I was so excited for this place to open. I got the steak taco and chicken taco..taste was very bland. Rice and beans were okay. I was not a fan of the food at all. I went with three other people. Someone at our table got the quesadilla which was not bad and the grilled corn looked pretty good. 

The service was not much better. Our waitress was terrible but the \"water girl\" was on point. By the end of our meal we were ready to close out. We had three checks come to the table. Two of them were wrong, so she took them back and adjusted them. We then gave her our cards to pay for the food. When she came back, my friend was charged $14.99 for a $9 meal. My friend confronted our waitress, who then took the card back and said she adjusted it. She came back with what appeared to be a check that was charged the correct amount but when my friend checked her bank account, she was now charged another $15 on top of the $14.99. We're up to $30 for a $9 meal. She spoke with the manager who apologized and said he would fix it. He gave us his business card and told us to call him if it was still an issue on Monday. 

So, Monday comes...and the $14.99 charge was still there. But now the $15 charge became a $29 charge... So now it's $45 for a $9 meal. How does that happen? We went into the restaurant later that day to speak with the GM and he apologized and credited her the money. He even credited the $9 for the meal, which he should have done the first time. He said it might take several days. All the money was eventually credited back but I still have no clue how and why this happened. It could have been an issue with their system, but it was most likely an inexperienced waitress. 

Maybe I just had really high hopes for this place. It's a shame because they are at such a great location. I am willing to give it another try. I will definitely edit this review after I do so."}
{"text":"Ironically, I'm sitting in Hot Taco right now. My boyfriend and I came to get $6 margaritas (a Thursday special) on a whim. Truthfully, the experience was awful. We waited 15 minutes before the hostess even returned to the stand to talk to us, then another 45 minutes for a table. We then waited 10 more minutes for our waitress, who didn't return to check on us for another 20 minutes. We ended up getting 2 drinks and ordering a check. The $6 margaritas were not worth the wait (overly sweet and generic), especially given it wasn't packed. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food poisoning! Beware!!!
My girlfriend and I ate here on December 29th for dinner. I ordered a simple chicken quesadilla. On December 30th I was throwing up everywhere for the next 4 days. I've also heard that many people who work there have gotten sick as well. I'd go just for drinks and chips and salsa. Not food. Never food."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to eat at Hot Taco at first based upon the previously posted sanitation score. 
I sat at the bar and had a few drinks. I was served by Joy and Noel, who were very friendly. The drinks were very good. I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos. I got my fish blackened, and they were amazing! I was pleased with my overall experience. This is a really cool place, and it is in an awesome and convenient  location 

I will add that the sanitation score is now a 93.5!! 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant, they have great drink specials. My favorite were the 1$ Mimosas on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever had from here to eat has not been good. Everything lacks flavor. Burrito and refried beans and rice were probably the worst things I've had from here. Taco Bell has better mexican food than this place. The only reason why this place even gets 2 stars is for drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere. Margaritas were very good. Bar tender named Amanda strengthened mine up for me because I can't have too much sugar. Our waitress Danielle was very efficient and nice. I got the fish and the ground beef taco which were both amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the chairs outside were uncomfortable. Great place for tacos and margs on a sunny day. 

Dress: casual. I had a sport coat on and ended up taking it off and rolling sleeves up. Very casual place, can prob even get away with shorts ...."}
{"text":"Kiersten was our server and she freaking rocked. Her customer service was on point. She was nothing but kind, even as she got busy. Love this place and my boyfriend and I will continue to come back every tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new restaurant, as it is in one of my favorite areas of town. All I can say is it conveniently located on \"Bland Street\" for a reason, because that is all my experience was: bland. I will note that all we got were margaritas, queso dip, salsa and chips, but I'll stand by the fact that you can usually tell a good Mexican food restaurant by it's drinks. 

The drinks were weak, and watered down. The queso dip tasted like something I would buy in the chip aisle at the grocers. The chips were cold, and the salsa had no kick. After such a disappointing first course, we didn't feel like we wanted to try a second course. 

The reason I'm giving it a three star review, is because I didn't try the food. It wasn't so disappointing that I would never go back. I would be willing to give it another shot in a few months when it isn't freshly open. 

It has such a good location, and a fun decor, I still have high hopes that this place will turn itself around!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going and was recommended by a few friends. The place looks great and is so fun. We luckily found parking without any issues. Starting, the chips and salsa were good-- salsa had some kick to it which I love. Our waitress was nice and very honest when asking for her opinion on drinks. The margarita I got was SO good. I was definitely craving one for a long time and it was satisfied. I ordered 3 carnitas tacos which came with rice and beans. The only real complaint is it took SO long for our food to get to our table. The tacos were good not great but I'd definitely be going again and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"let's just say. someone loves salt in the kitchen everything from shrimp to the tacks had so much salt we could not at it.  even the cold tomatoes and onions had way to much salt. bummer. really wanted tacos"}
{"text":"Just left. And wow, salty! But it was delicious. We got a free appetizer for checking in on Yelp which was awesome(but the waitress forgot to take it off the bill and then somehow charged my boyfriends card three times,we found out today, two days later) We got the stuffed jalapeños. Which I would recommend as long as you like salt and you don't decide to drink a margarita with your meal like my boyfriend did.  I got the chimichanga which was delicious the meat was super tender and again salty but I was okay with it. 
 
I also spilled a water and my waitress watched me spill my water and didn't offer me any towel or help clean it up. She hair left it and even returned to the table multiple times. It wasn't even busy.  

I don't know,  the vibe was cool, as was the decor but I don't feel like I need to come back."}
{"text":"Muy Bueno! I hate that Hot Taco is getting such a bad wrap, I was pretty impressed! 

The first time I went the service was pretty bad.. Hints why I gave them the 4 stars (sorry Taco). The waitress acted like she had no idea what was on the menu, and took her almost 15 mins to finally get our drink orders. But the food was still tasted great. 

The second time the service was much faster, and she actually knew the menu (her name was Murphy, ask for her). The food was still spot on, and I have to say it may have tasted a little better. 

I recommend Hot Taco. But not their desserts, save your sweet tooth for a specialist."}
{"text":"Hostess was very Pleasant with seating us, because we wanted to sit outside.  However our serve Dominique was absolutely terrible. After ordering mimosas we received out food and half way though our mimosas were brought to us. With the excuse of it being the bartenders fault. Being that I bartend I completely understand however I think it was the fact she forgot to put our order in.  After we declined on having mimosas. We asked for xtra Salsa and lemons, she continued to come come outside and ask every table except for ours if they needed anything. I tried to give the benefit of the doubt however I just decided I would never come back to hot taco just because of the experience I had this time, there is other places I could've been too. You all should reconsider having her in a section outside. My apologies.."}
{"text":"My favorite taco spot until today...
We were on the waitlist for three hours. After two tables who came after us were seated (all parties had the same # of people) we decided to seat ourselves. After explaining the scenario to two nice servers the \"manager\" came to tell us \"we are going to get up and leave\". 

I told her we were on the list and MAGICALLY our names disappeared from the list. Kristen and the \"manager\" had us escorted off the property. Not just \"you're going to get up\" after 3 hour wait, but escorted off the property. 

Tacos anyone? & yes, that's her in the orange escorting 4 wellwell-behaved Hispanic  females off the property. 

Happy cinco de mayo!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone is so down on this place. Perhaps it's because I waited a while before starting to come here - who knows. I've been here a few times and find the drinks are both decently made and reasonably priced, the food has hit that Mexican sweet spot somewhere between authentic (like someone's mom is cooking in the back kitchen - my favorite type of Mexican food) and slightly upscale, and the vibe of the place is pretty neat as well. 

My most recent visit was around 7:30 on a Saturday with a party of 6. We were able to snag a table on the patio very quickly and our waitress was attentive and quick with chips, salsa, queso, and drinks. While I stuck to import bottles and drafts, several partook in the $6 mimosa carafes (probably a liter a piece if I had to venture a guess). We ordered food and it came out about the time you would expect for a party of our size and time/day of the week. I split a fajita with my wife and while nothing blew me away, it was still a good dish. We were able to get our check easily and were well on our way without issue.

This has been a pretty typical experience for me whether it's after a Panther's game or my wife and I pop in while walking the rail trail with our dog (I highly recommend this spot to re-energize with a beer and some chips). I definitely plan on coming back and think Hot Taco has been a great addition to this booming area in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I'm obsessed with the grilled corn side. Our server Destiny was one of the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice. Both times were for Taco Tuesday. Great prices with tacos and margaritas being $2 each. The first time, my service was great! My waitress was amazing even though it was busy. The $2 margaritas are watered down so I suggest the $4 ones. The second time, the service was TERRIBLE! First when we got there, we were told our wait would be about an hour. After an hour we checked to see where we were on the list and she said it would be another 30mins which we noticed others that got there after us were seated before us. We were sat at a table under a pipe or something which kept leaking water on us from the condensation. We then moved tables, they were out of pork so I couldn't get any pork tacos. It must've just been a busy and unorganized day but I will definitely be back. They great and diverse music."}
{"text":"The nicest thing I can say is that they stay open later than Phat Burrito. I'm kinda surprised they have such cartoonish statues of stereotypes out front but the other decor elements like the antique lamps over the main dining area are reminiscent of my travels in central Texas. I like the separated booth area in the middle, as it's pleasantly far enough away from the bar that should a crowd 3 people deep develop over there you won't feel that someone's elbow will end up in your plate because the booth is on a riser.  

When we came in I was more peckish than hungry but none of the appetizers appealed to me that night though they did have a good variety available. I went with a 3 chicken taco plate and it was unremarkable. In no way was the food undesirable, it arrived quickly, it was warm, though we were ordering late, the chicken wasn't over cooked or gave any indication it wasn't just made. From a flavoring perspective there was nothing distinctive about the meal. Since I wasn't ordering among their collection of tequila's (sadly they don't have my favorite Clase Azul like Vida Vida) the only reason to order a chicken taco here than phat burrito or chipotle than: Is it after 10pm ?

Since we were here after 9pm on their first week the place was slow and service is finding its way still. When our waitress left for the night no one was assigned to us. I had to wave down another table's waitress to get the check, once I had my card in the folder while we waited for someone to pick it up 2 different people came by to see if we wanted refilled water and third person came by to take our plates. Finally I took the check to the bar. Only after I signed the check I realized I had been given the completely different bill. So it took more time to find a manager, void the wrong check out, go through our original waitress's open checks, find my correct order and rerun my card.

Pregame here or stop by on your way home on the lightrail to sober up because the food so far isn't much to remember."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a low rating, I loved it! Came here wirh Holly, she got the guac (looked awesome!) I got the taco loco, and a $3 Corona Light, really enjoyed the place and outdoor seating! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Got here, waitress seemed annoyed we were here. Food was great! But our service was the slowest ever. Waitress only came for a round of drinks and to take or food orders, deliver food, and that's it. Terrible service. And the restaurant wasn't busy at all. But yummy pollo taco. 3 people the entire place."}
{"text":"So I typical write a review after my second time at an establishment to give them a chance to redeem if neccessary. Well this is my second time here and I typically start at the bar. Well if you enjoy being in someone's personal space to get the attention of the bartender then this is your spot. They rarely make eye contact with you and it's always 3 or less behind the bar especially for this to be a busy place. The first time we attended a separate event that included this place and others. The second time was doing a national event. Food wise: first time, food was cold and the second time there was an 2 hour wait to be seated with a lot of tables empty. Food was average. Drink was watered down. There were not many waitresses/ servers to begin with. I probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour and they seated people who came in after us with same number of people.  Brought cheese dip no chips.  Waiting on food now.  Ready to leave without food and grab fast food on way home."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie, especially Mexican food, I've been looking for a new Mexican restaurant to call my favorite and this is it! Taco Tuesday and $2 mimosas are the best on Saturday and Sunday! I'm so glad I found out about this place from the #YelpgetsLucky event! I love the atmosphere and all the decorations! You'll get the best service from the bartenders! It seems like the waitresses sometimes forget about you, but overall a place I'll be frequenting"}
{"text":"Decent. I normally only go on tuesdays for cheap tacos. $2 is a good price for these tacos. Half the time they mess something up on the order though :/"}
{"text":"So I've been coming here since Aug 2016. I come here almost once a week so long as I'm not out of town for work. It always my go to! They have the best specials in Charlotte! I've yet to find a better place! They always take care of me and provide outstanding service at the bar! Tuesday's are my favorite! There are special's seven days a week! Plenty of tv's and they will usually play any sport you request. Also, I just want to give a shout out to the best bartender in the area...Noel! Go in and have a great time!"}
{"text":"I don't like to leave low reviews but this was just terrible. 

Sum of our experience: 
- Server was cool
- Atmosphere is what you pay for
- Food was awful (honestly I've had better food at Chipotle)


This was our first night visiting Charlotte and we took a drive to get some food. Stopped in because the place looks really cool. Some awesome authentic decorations, they really put a lot into making this place look fun. That is pretty much all we enjoyed.

Got tacos and fajitas. The tacos were bland with barely any flavor. A spicy shrimp taco tasted like deep fried shrimp tossed in buffalo sauce.... hardly authentic. Another chicken taco was so dry I didn't even want to eat it. 

Boyfriend got steak fajitas that looked like dog food. The amount of peppers and onions looked like the leftover scraps from the night, soggy and burnt at the same time, clearly not fresh. Served with a couple of dirty plates for ya folks. This was supposed to be their discounted fajita night special so not sure if the poor quality had anything to do with that...

Also had a margarita in a pint that I'm pretty sure had no alcohol in it. I'm a lightweight and could have ran a marathon after this. 

We were so disappointed because we frequent taco and marg restaurants everywhere we go and this was the worst by far."}
{"text":"The worst wait staff ever. Used to love coming to Hot Taco on Tuesday's, and understood that wait staff would be a little slow because of how busy Tuesdays are. Ordered a Margarita before ordering food and didn't receive it until after I had finished eating. They should not be training new waiters on such a busy night. Unfortunately will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went here with high hopes. I entered and the place seemed just cheesy enough and appropriately themed that it might actually be a good spot. We came in with a large party, without a reservation, and we're told we'd be seated soon. I asked for a time and they said just a few minutes. 

After 20 minutes I asked again - when we'd be seated and was again told just a minute. After another 15 minutes, I yet again went to ask and this time asked to speak to a manager, as there had been significant table turnover in this time. We finally got seated 10 minutes later. 

While this wait wouldn't have been a problem, if we'd been told up front, we were strung along and would have gone elsewhere, had we been told at the onset that we'd have a 45 minute plus wait. 

Overall the food was average and not all the orders were correct. The saving grace were the happy hour prices on tacos and margaritas. I might return given the happy hour prices, but would try other places first given the service."}
{"text":"We (5 of us)went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. There were probably 4 or 5 other tables full besides us. The hostess was very friendly and sat us right away. The waitress was also very nice and took our drink order right away. We all ordered tacos... All of the tacos came out cold, so cold that we almost thought they were supposed to be served that way. We let our waitress know and she had new tacos out for everyone! The problem was they were still all cold! The manager was nice and didn't charge us for anything, but the food just isn't good!"}
{"text":"Taco tuesday all food was great ,we where there about 1pm we sat outside service person needs to be trained a little better ,the other table got their food then the drinks .my wife got a togo order ask the sever if the tacos shells where in there the girl said yes. once again you have to check your order  got shells on the side got home no shells , the service needs to show a little urgency  on customer service ,all server just in one gear slow . but the food was good"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times as I lived next door. Gave it so many chances. The service is terrible. The hosts are always rude and inattentive. The servers always seem to have too many tables and a bad attitude. I'm always waiting to get their attention to get something they missed, a refill, or the check. The food is fine but nothing to crave. It's always busy on weekend or late nights as it's near popular bars. Beware of crying girls in the bathroom and drunk bros."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has such a low rating! I came here on a Saturday afternoon after seeing it from the Light Rail a week earlier, and the building itself intrigued me. The building contains 4 different locations, two of which were closed leading me to believe they're more for the nightlife scene. Hot Taco is on the northernmost end of the building. 

We went in to find a very large space that was very well decorated. We were seated immediately and our waitress came out to serve us almost instantly. Our server was an absolute sweetheart. I can't remember her name, but she was absolutely lovely. 

I had the tacos al pastor, which came with a choice of beans and red rice. The food was great. It wasn't the very best taco I've ever had, but it was delicious and very filling. We finished the meal with some churros, which were also delicious. 

Overall, there's nothing bad that can be said about Hot Taco from my visit. The food is great, the prices are very reasonable, and getting there is super easy - it's right off the Bland Street Station. I'm hoping I have another reason to go very soon!"}
{"text":"My taco was anything but 'hot', in fact, it came out lukewarm at best. The beans tasted like they had gone bad and I didn't touch them after one bite. The rice was ok but tasted dry and as if it was reheated from another day. My boyfriend ordered three tacos, 2 el pastor and 1 Baja fish, and managed to get three completely different tacos? (One of the el pastor tacos he couldn't finish because it was way too spicy  when it's actually supposed to be sweet. We told the waitress that he got the wrong taco and she said that we were wrong) The specials may be enticing but save your money."}
{"text":"Okay my original review was 2 months the ago and I gave them 2 stars. I'm bumping them up 1.5 stars to a rating of 3.5. And this is my second time coming back since Feb. Last month, I sat at the bar which was a great experience and the bar tender was great. I came back in with my mom on Saturday around 2:30pm and had a hiccup. The restaurant wasn't full but we had to wait about 8 mins for a table, still not really a big deal to me. Anywho much to my surprise, I had the same server that epically failed during my 1st review. Okay this was their chance to redeem themselves and also my chance to provide another review. Once again, I was rooting for Hot Taco. The food is so good but unfortunately the service is spotty. I also just think that serving isn't the strong suit of the server we had.  Food came  out hot and fast unlike the last time, our server even came back to check on us a couple of times. Definitely a step up from the last time. Here's where there was a hiccup. Of course I checked in on my Yelp app and redeemed the free appetizer. I ordered the empanadas for the app and then a side of grilled corn. My mom got a combo plate. When the bill came, my app was still on the bill and they also charged me for the app corn and not the side corn. When I kindly pointed it out to our server and I told her I asked for grilled corn and not the app corn, she replied that she wasn't paying attention when I was placing my order.  This was the same issue that we had the last time when she was our server, which was why many of our orders were not correct. Needless to say, the manager ended up comping me the grilled corn and of course the appetizer. Next time, I may just ask for an different server."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now - the first time was during opening week so I wanted to give it another chance before reviewing.  The service has certainly improved, and i LOVE the apps (stuffed jalapenos, queso, etc.), but I have yet to be impressed by the drinks.  

The margarita menu is awesome (from the looks and details) - but I've now had a few different ones made by different bartenders - and the verdict is the same...
I have no problem paying top dollar for a great marg with good tequila, but if I keep returning and continue paying top dollar, I don't want a watered down, plain, weak drink :-/

Might try it again for the apps - or ask for a shot of tequila and assemble my own marg?  Idk...too bad because the ambiance and location are great.  

This place has potential."}
{"text":"$2 Taco night is crazy - get here early! The food is good but they are terribly under staffed. Service depends on the wait staff. The floor is wet and people are falling all over the place. I almost fell twice. The manager has a smart mouth.  Don't Check this place out !"}
{"text":"Hot Taco needs a new name.  How about Cold Taco Watery Beer?  Long wait times, and not so great food.. Fun place to hang out though."}
{"text":"Meh.   Came here with my kids who enjoyed sitting outside and watching the light rail.  Server was pleasant.  Food was warmish and edible. 

However, everything we ordered took forever to come out... Drinks, appys, entrees.... Even though it wasn't very busy (around 1pm on a Sunday) As food and drink did come out, virtually everything was initially delivered to a different table or had stuff delivered to our table that we hadn't ordered.   While everything was able to be sorted out, it was just sad how mediocre all food was.   Guacamole was a grayish green (I get this color when I make at home and have left overs that I mix up the next day), unspicy and unsalted.  Street taco sampler was rather bland and unmemorable.   Chili verde carnitas were ok, but greasy and lacking in flavor to be found at MANY more capable taco shops.  Margarita tasted like it was based on a mediocre mix and tasted like there wasn't any alcohol."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time recently and won't choose to go back. We were seated quickly, but everything after that was SLOW. The place was full but not packed out by any means. We ordered guac for an appetizer ($9) and that came out a good 10 minutes after we ordered it. My buddy ordered the steak fajitas, two of us ordered chicken chimichangas, and another ordered enchiladas. I should have timed the wait, but it was to the point where we all asked ourselves twice where the food was. I saw tons of plates sitting in front of the kitchen not moving for long periods of time. Finally we saw sizzling fajitas coming our way, but they were given to a table that was sat long after us.
Turns out these were our fajitas and the ticket was labeled wrong. The person bringing our the food was visibly pissed off as they were throwing a mini tantrum in front of the kitchen about the error. The rest of our food came out a few minutes later, and we waited another 10 minutes for new fajitas. My chimichanga ended up being a burrito, as it was not fried. They took half the cost off the fajitas and comped a beer. The waitress was nice. The kitchen seems to be lacking severely. There are countless other Mexican places to get better food and better service."}
{"text":"Hello I would love leave a review about the wonderful Ms. Jade. Her customer service and attention was excellent. Jade being my server today will be the number one reason I return and recommend Hot Taco to my friends and family. Great Job Jade aka Miss Congeniality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could do negative stars I would. Our bartender was not friendly or approachable. She never mentioned her name. It's just disappointing. Coming from the restaurant business myself, you always know the people who come in your restaurant are the only way you are going to make money.  Between the constant texting one on her phone and lack of checking up. To top it off it seemed like she had an attitude even when we were friendly. Which made me have a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be returning. As well tell everyone how much they sucked. Bad service all around. Do better , you are too new for this shit."}
{"text":"My wife and I almost did not go here, because of so many bad reviews; however, we tried it anyway and we really like it.   The chips and salsa were excellent.  We shared the 3 taco meal and it was quite good.  The service was attentive.  Maybe the restaurant was just working out opening jitters.  We will for sure go back again."}
{"text":"Had a great time at $2 taco night! Great food! And service was amazing! Thanks to our server Lauren!"}
{"text":"Hot Taco is authentic Mexican in the same way Taco Bell is authentic Mexican -- they both use the Spanish word \"taco?\" I ordered some al pastor tacos and they are bland bland bland. Similar to any fast food taco, but maybe with a dash of pineapple. So really the $2 \"special\" is still overpriced. The service was even less to write home about. To be fair we did have a large group, but there are some basic requirements of service. For example, even when you are a \"new hire\" perhaps don't offer up food and say \"I'm new I don't know what any of these are.\" Yeah well all your crappy tacos look the same. 

There are some nice parts about the establishment -- there's a good number of parking spaces across the street and the outside patio does fit large groups well. But just don't go expecting to enjoy your food or even get the drink you ordered."}
{"text":"Had some confusion over outside seating. Some sections are bar service only. I stopped the manager and asked for a server. Told him of all the places in Charlotte I wanted to come here for my birthday. He got us a server right  away and brought out a round of birthday drinks for my husband and I! The tacos were yummy we tried every one on the $2 taco Tuesday list!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We had been here before and it was awesome - we invited friends to joins us. How embarrassing!! We were a party of 5 and told there was a 30 minute wait. An hour later and after two other large (younger) parties were seated before us we were finally seated and only after we complained. Ordered cheese dip which arrived with no chips - they arrived much later. I ordered nachos with found beef - they may have had a tablespoon of beef. We will not return here."}
{"text":"Went for Taco Tuesday. We were first seated at a table. I asked the hostess if she could clear off one of the dirty booths so we could sit there (there were 3 dirty booths in a row). We sat and waited for at least 20 minutes for someone to clean one booth off. We watched every single server and bus person walk past them without cleaning them off. When they finally cleared off the booth our waitress was obviously very overwhelmed. She handled herself very well considering she had a boatload of tables. I ordered 2 margaritas and they were very inconsistent. Neither one had the correct ratio of mix to alcohol. I'm sure it was a premixed drink. Sad. The tacos were awful and were unappealing looking. The only good one was a the veggie taco I got. I was surprised with how good that one was. So I got 1 out of 4 that was good. The waitress spilled water all over one of our friends. She was really sorry but she could have destroyed his phone if he hadn't moved it quickly. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I came here without reading the reviews first and I'm glad I didn't because I probably wouldn't have tried it, but I thought it was pretty good actually. 

The prices are very reasonable, especially for the combination plates. I had a combination plate with 2 empanadas, 2 tacos and 2 stuffed jalapenos with rice and beans for only $12. Stuffed jalapenos were the best thing and dipping those and the empanadas in the chipotle ranch made them even better. The fish and shrimp tacos were pretty good, but a little bland as others have mentioned. Once I put some cholula on them they were good though.

We came on a Monday and they had the mini margaritas on special for $4. They were very good. Not too sweet and decently strong. They have a great tequila selection with flights available as well. Will try that next time.

Overall, nothing too fancy but certainly good for such reasonable prices. Service was great as well. Also, they have plenty of big screen tv's showing MNF at the moment."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place and last night was such a let down. It was so much the food as it was the service. The waitress who took our order didn't write anything down, so I repeated it twice just so she would remember. I ordered the blackened fish tacos both soft, it came out one hard, one soft and the chicken was just grilled, no seasoning whatsoever. My wife the same, one hard one soft she asked for mushrooms on hers and so they rudely took the plates back to fix them. She returned with mine and my wife's 10 mins later. I again said that my fish was to be blackened and they said that was their version of blackened. Folks it had no seasoning on it at all! The waitress was rude and spent most of the by the kitchen talking to the other staff. It took 10mins to get her to give us a to go box and another 10 mins for the bill. I would hate to be the person/group who put this restaurant together and have it get terrible reviews mainly because of the staff. This is the face of your business! Hire some people who take pride in their jobs. I wanted this to be my go to Taco place, the food is decent if it's prepared the way you want. The service is absolutely terrible. The ownership needs to come in and clean the \"front of the house\" and start over. You guys are loosing $$$ because of this."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and the food was just ok. Kind of dry and bland. 
The salsa was good though and the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get tacos for cheap on a Tuesday night. $2 tacos are good on the stomach, but easy on the wallet. I give this place 3 stars, simply, because it seems to have gone down in quality and service over the few years that I've been coming here. When I first started coming, the tacos were WAY better, until they changed the menu. This change brought on a lower selection of tacos, as well as less ingredients inside the tacos. I would say that my favorite taco was the Baja fish taco, which included a nice Baja sauce to compliment the fish. Now, the fish tacos no longer have the Baja sauce, and appear to have more of a dry texture. I had a few other favorites as well, but those tacos aren't as good anymore either. I used to come in every week, but that stopped once the menu changed. There are also quite a bit of workers there with a poor attitude, which makes things even worse. I'm not sure about anyone else, but I've learned in life, when you have something good, such as good food and service, you don't change it to lower quality food and bad service. That's a good way to lose loyal customers. I'm currently looking for a better place to get good tacos."}
{"text":"Food came out at room temperature. We were the first there on a Saturday and expected fairly fast service. The flavor in the Tacos was good but nothing on the plate was hot. The food temp seemed like it was sitting for awhile. I'm not sure what is going on with Hot Taco in regards to food not coming out hot. The service was great and our waitress was excellent, but the food not being HOT really disappointed us. 

The manager came out and apologized. He also took care of the bill. I want to give them a second chance but it seems others have been since our visit so I'm apprehensive. I think this place would be great for drinking but not eating. Kinda sad since there are so many great options for dinning in this area and I hoped finally we would get a great place for Tacos. I guess we will wait and see if the reviews become positive before visitng again."}
{"text":"Honestly I cannot review this place because we haven't tasted their food yet but just got inside and were told the wait time was an hour !!!! Okay, one hour seriously?? There were only 3 to 4 parties in the waiting area though, okay I don't know and not judging. But still, our first impression was not that good. Usually I don't see much crowd there and also not great reviews so far. So we decided to give it a shot on a Tuesday night when they serve $2 tacos. Probably that's why the wait time was an hour. Whatever."}
{"text":"My friend and I were seated right away. Decor is very \"Nacho Libre\"-like. Staff very friendly. It wasn't crowded since we ended up eating a late lunch. We both ordered the 2 tacos for $8 deal. Both fish. Like with the some of the other reviewers, I was expecting a tiny nugget of fish in my tacos and BOOM that's what we got. It was no more than 2\" long encased in two really dry corn tortillas about 6\" in diameter. The fish nugget was hidden in a 2\" pile of thick shredded lettuce. 10% fish, 75% lettuce and 20% very dry corn tortillas. Just plain awful. I ended up picking through it and barely could finish it. Very bland. Nothing to hoot and holler. I guess this place would be good after a late night out of the town. But if you're better off saving your $ finding a taco truck for more bang."}
{"text":"81.5%... That's the sanitation grade!  In all my years of eating at restaurants, this is the worst I have seen by 8 points!  Check for yourself at www.public.cdphes.com. I'm actually sick to my stomach thinking about it. All the other reviews talk about bad service, ok food and decor. 

Service- we sat at the bar and service was fast and the bar girls were very pleasant. 

Food- it was \"ok\" at best. Favorite item was the Korean taco. Drinks were priced right and good.. As drinks should be. 

Decor- loved it. Very cool looking place... Pretty dead for a Friday night at 7pm. 

I will never be back to place. Owner should be ashamed to be open. The manager should be fired.  Nothing they could say would EVER justify an 81.5% sanitation grade.  I wish I could have given a zero rating. 

SHAME ON YOU."}
{"text":"Another great white person taco place. When I say white I mean you're paying for the atmosphere and location. Both of these rank a 5 for me. Paying 12 bucks for two tacos though? I'd rate that a 2. The quality isn't great. I tried the fish tacos and the muy caliente tacos. Both were okay but don't say very hot tacos and forget to put in the peppers. My 3 year old niece could have eaten this it was so mild. In my opinion if you're looking to impress your date with how much money you have and want to fit in them this is the place. If you want authentic Mexican food head to the east side of town! Ten times the quality for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Rocci was amazing!!!! So nice, so professional, super cute, fast, and great personality! This place is great for a night with friends. Great queso and guach, great apps, loved our night."}
{"text":"I'll say this: when I was drivvin around in my benz searching for an elusive raymen bar that my wife so lovingly picked out, hot taco was there for me. When I couldn't figure out where the damn place was I told her \"I'll see you at home. I must eat now\" I pull off over the train tracks, they scrape the bottom of the benz. 

I digress. 

It seemed like all was forgiven when I walked up to HT (locals nickname for hot taco) and realized it was taco Tuesday.... Call my wife and apologise. She's slurping ramen. 

I start slurping margs at the bar. Get the nachos. They're servicable. Waiter disappears. Ok. Load up on 2 dollar tacs. I'm talking 1,2 of each sometimes. I wait. Wife calls. Hit ignore. 

And hence the tacs come out. Presentation was... off. It looked like the ones my nephew makes at his birthday parties where he plays the chef. The tacs were decent. I'm not knocking my nephew's taco skills but he's not opening a restaurant anytime soon. 

All I can say is when I saw the ratings on Yelp, I wasnt exactly surprised. But at the end of the day, tacos are tacos. Brought a few home to the wife, she wasn't enthused. 

Skip.


UPDATE: tried HT again, waiter knew about me from my review. Mentioned a secret menu item, roast beef and picklett nachos. A+ work. Great flavor and the presentation really worked for me"}
{"text":"Meh sums it up pretty well. Went for $2 Tuesday, where every taco, mini margaritas, and Coronitas are $2. The space is really neat. It's well decorated and open. The patio is pretty awesome too. The food was very disappointing. The queso (added chorizo) was watery and bland. I ordered an assortment of tacos and couldn't find any that were actually palatable. The Ahi Tuna Taco was actually bad... Like fishy fish bad. The best thing on the table were the chips. I will be returning to enjoy drinks and munch on the free chips, but I won't be consuming any food until they fix the quality."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere ...absolutely HORRIBLE service. I am amazed at the shit show that my friend and I experienced at this ( I use this term lightly) ...restaurant. Read the past reviews and believe them when they say this establishment does not have a clue how to run a restaurant. Once we sat down we were welcomed...check...given our menus...check...server was very nice...check...we are on a roll.. . she explains the drink specials ( Mimosas on a Friday Night...odd) but whatever...so we ordered two lime margaritas on the rocks. Tick, Tick, tick, 20 minutes later our drinks arrive with a basket of chips and salsa. Okay so the drinks were great. She asked if we wanted to order. Busy catching up we asked if she could give a few minutes to look over the menu. If I knew then what was to come...Tick, Tick, Tick ...20 minutes, Tick, tick tick..30 minutes goes by...Tick, Tick Tick...40 minutes no sign of the waitress. In fact, she was nowhere on the floor. Keep in mind we still have not placed our food order and it is over an hour since we were seated. I try to catch the eye of the young waitress who was waiting on the customers in the booth behind us. Eventually she looked up and came over to the table. I asked if she could find our waitress for us. She asked which one we told her the name and she walked away. Guess what...Tick, tick, tick 10 freaking minutes later our waitress approaches our table and asks.....wait for it..\" Has anyone taken your order yet?\"...Yep you read it correctly. OUR waitress asked if someone ELSE took our order. By this point my nice demeanor was wearing thin ..\"Please bring us our check this service is horrible\". Her response \" Okay\". She walks away. No offer no apologies. And............Tick, Tick, Tick... freaking 10 minutes later we get the check and she disappears again. Never to be seen again. My friend lost her cool grabbed the check and walked up to the bar which at the point was told \" I am sorry I cannot checkout your bill at the bar you have to pay your server\". Deep breath..in and out..in and out then we told her what our experience was. Still no dinner. The bartender was very nice she comped us one of the drinks which was fair and apologized. We left and went next door to the American Pub and had amazing service. In fact, the manager stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our drinks and if we needed anything. We told him we had a horrible experience at Hot Taco, which he then explained they were owned by the same company. I was dumbfounded. The same company and we had two extremely different experiences. Hot Taco you have serious management issues. You will not succeed in Charlotte if you continue to go down this path. I will never recommend this restaurant. I am interested to see if I receive a response. That will be the true test of the level of customer service. I would highly recommend American Pub because the entire staff and the Manager took the time during a very busy night to make sure we were taken care of. Good job American Pub."}
{"text":"Kristen gave the worst service I have ever had. Not only did the sever yell at me for explaining what was wrong with my friends food but she also told me \"it's not that serious.\" I have been a server for 7 years and if I would have acted that way at work I would have been fired. 

It was my friend's birthday as well so we came in excited and left disappointed.

The manager however was respectful and promptly tried to get our problems solved in a calm manner."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food, overpriced, and they charge extra for standard items. Dirty menus, they were out of several standard ingredients (no black beans or chorizo), and our meals were completely subpar.  Our second and last visit."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was terrible.  Our waiter didn't greet us for 5+ minutes and she didn't introduce herself or ask us if we wanted anything. We had to ask for everything which is not what a sit-down restaurant is about. I understand it's Saturday night but you should treat everyone like a priority. I don't even know what our servers name was cause she was at our table probably 2 or 3 times the whole night."}
{"text":"Cool bar with big open spaces and massive Windows so you feel like your outside. Food was good (I recommend the taco sampler) but the guacamole was bad. It had no seasoning (lime or salt) so beware. The queso with chorizo was amazing and comes with a candle under it to keep it warm...sweet! Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Never go here! Walked in to a 20 minute wait because \"we have no servers.\" Should have known to leave then, but I was feeling patient so I said sure no problem and gave the hostess my phone number to be texted when we were ready to sit. Never got a text. 45 minutes later hostess comes over and says \"were you wanting to sit?\" Why yes, yes we were. Ended up leaving without eating. Horrible service and complete disregard for customers. Great location unfortunate restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hot Taco.  I met a friend there for a Friday lunch.  We were seated immediately - no wait, which were thrilled to find.  The decor is great - bright colors and open.  Our server welcomed us promptly and we had drinks and chips almost immediately.  

The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was quite tasty - one of the highlights of the meal.  

I ordered the korean beef tacos with black beans and rice.  I had hoped to split the taco order and get one seared tuna taco, but they will not allow you to mix and match - even though the cost for each dish is the same.  Okay, that's their policy and it's fine, but perhaps I would have had a better experience if I had other food to try.  The korean beef tacos were fine - but, bland.  I had hoped for a real burst of flavor with the meat - instead it tasted a bit like a beef taco with some lettuce and cucumber.  Meh.  Not bad, but also not necessarily good.  

My friend ordered the skinny taco salad with grilled chicken - imagine a taco salad less the shell.  She ate about half of her chicken before getting to a section of the chicken that was pink and raw.  The server, manager and cook all came out to apologize and replace her meal - but we were nearly done at that point.  To compensate, they did comp her meal, bring coupons and a free churros dessert.  The grilled chicken was sliced before it came to the table - all they needed to do was look at it to see it was undercooked.  Mistakes are made, but raw chicken is a pretty big deal.  The churros were delicious.

Overall, the service was prompt and attentive.  I loved the decor.  I wish the food had impressed me more."}
{"text":"So... arrived at ~5:30 and sat outside... ordered by 5:35... then we waited... and waited... and waited. No one checked on us (2 people) until 6:15. At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30.
Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing.
Chances are, I won't be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot!
To top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for."}
{"text":"The food is great and that's why it is so hard to give such a bad review but the service is absolutely terrible. I have been there 5 times and somehow the service gets worse each time."}
{"text":"My wife is in a wheelchair and as we entered were told that there was a wait for inside but outside could be seated immediately. We were fine with outside, but noticed on the way in there's a lot of steps and high top seating on the patio. We asked if it was accessible where we could be seated immediately and we were told yes. The hostess leads us to the patio and straight to the stairs down onto the lower area, without even turning around. My wife had to turn around on her own and go back down the main entrance ramp and around the front to the side gated patio entrance. The positive is that it is handicap accessible. Once we were seated, our server was training another server and things seemed a little awkward. We didn't feel welcomed, more like just another table to get through. When my margarita was brought out it was dropped off on the other side of the table across from where I was sitting by the training server and just left there as she went on with what she was doing. When the food came out, it wasn't 100% correct as one of my three tacos was not what I ordered, and while presentation of the food was on point, the taste at this visit left something to be desired. Maybe it was the whole vibe of the meal covering up the flavor. Overall, location, atmosphere, design and decor are amazing! Taco Tuesday prices are great, too. I only gave 3 stars because this particular visit (my first) didn't stand out with service or flavor."}
{"text":"I came with six people...  Not one meal was good! Full of grease, didn't taste like anything! Best part was the stale chips! Would not recommend at all! I"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Lauren is the best waitress ever who makes your experience ten times better and let's you know of every special going on!! She is so real and refreshing as a waitress! The food is great and fast and they have the best deals."}
{"text":"Saturday night was busy! Got seated by a group of 12 guys and we couldn't figure what they were doing. Then another table of guys behind us threw something at a table of guys beside us. My friend and I were apparently trapped among them. It was most adult men all together I had ever seen...so strange to me. 

Anyway, the service was good, tacos were delicious and the guac had an extra taste of lime, but it was good!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and prompt. Location is great and the decor is fun.

Unfortunately the food was sub-par and oversalted.  I had the carnitas and had to send them back to the kitchen exchange for chicken fajitas because they were so salty I couldn't stomach choking down a whole plate. The chicken fajitas were ok but rather dry. I had a strawberry frozen magarita that tasted soley like cheap tequila.

I've been previously and the food was solid. So maybe the kitchen was having a bad noght."}
{"text":"Give me a reason to eat here? Come on - really? I want to eat here, it's convenient, I like Mexican food - I can even walk here! They just give me no good reason to eat here.

It's obvious when a restaurant views the place from the perspective of the owner rather than from the perspective of the customer. This place is all of that.

Lunch - no lunch menu. $11 for a burrito. Ok - fine, I can do an $11 burrito (once in a while) but what do I get? No vegetables? Look, there are many places where I can get the same $5 burrito. Qdoba, Salsaritas, Chipotle - even Taco Bell ! But what I can't get at those places is fresh vegetables. So you would think for $11 I'd get fresh vegetables? No. Not a one. Not even tomatoes and lettuce on top. Well then Mr. Owner - you tell me - why would I go here?

Taco Tuesday. Need I say more? The place IS A Taco Tuesday. The only reason to stomach it is because you only got $2 and it happens to be Tuesday. Stale chips - uninspired tacos - but cheap! Like a bad $1 drive though. 

They changed their menu, now you can't get combination platters? Seriously? The one thing that may want me to consider coming back has been removed from the menu? Good job! Good luck paying that rent."}
{"text":"Servers need to be trained better. And it's making sense after seeing Management for Hot Taco. It's clearly someone with a minimum amount of experience who is easily overwhelmed. I'm so annoyed with Hot Taco, I'm not even going to waste time listing all the problems we continually have at this establishment. I'll upload pictures. But a brief summary is an hour wait, as more than 7 tables were empty because \"they notifying people of their tables and giving them time to get there\". At one point, I asked management if the two tables by the bar were bar seating, or if they are just not being used. She gave me the same excuse above and said we had 4 groups ahead of us. By time I walked back to my group, they notified us that our table was ready. Then sent us outside to a tiny table in the dark. That was followed by a 20 minute wait for a server to acknowledge us. Followed by incorrect orders to come out after an additional hour wait. Followed by checks being incorrect. I so badly want to blame this on Tuesdays being busy, but I've been during the day at other times with barely anyone there and the service still sucked. They need new management and training for servers. Also, one of the female bartenders.... I won't throw her under the bus, but your prejudice is showing. Stop treating customers of different ethnicities so starkly different, right in front of each other.

Sidebar: I asked for no cabbage on my tacos. There was cabbage on the tacos, and a side of it. I honestly thought it was a prank until.i asked the server about it. She said she knows I said no cabbage, but she had them put it on the side in case. I told her it was on my tacos as well, and she asked me why I hadn't told her. I can give you a few reasons why I didn't tell you there was cabbage on my tacos. 

1. You left and didn't come back for 30 minutes.
2. The food has already taken an hour to come out, and that was in addition to the hour it took for us to get seated, and the 20-30 minutes we waited to be acknowledged.
3. I wasn't going to risk having to wait any longer to eat. So I picked off what I could. 

Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ok food, what else can I say...the food was very generic and ok, nothing special.  Service was good though but I rate this place based on food since there are so many better Mexican options."}
{"text":"Came for the Taco Tuesday $2 taco special around 1pm. We weren't greeted upon entering and ending up seating ourselves. After about 5 min we were brought complimentary chips and salsa and water. You could tell our waitress was having a rough day as she rushed us and rolled her eyes when I asked to change my taco shell from flour to corn. 

The tacos were ok but the service was poor. I guess for the value it was overall decent place to get a cheap bite to eat. I'm big on good service though so I had to rate this experience as just average."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I enjoyed it. Only think for Sunday football is they need to have more games on than just the local game."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience at this restaurant over the weekend. 7:30pm reservation for 12, seated promptly with chips and delicious salsa. Our server was very nice, but something is seriously lacking in their operations. We waited 20 minutes to give a drink order, and another 15 to give our food order. By 9pm we hadn't gotten our food, and when we asked we were told there were 3 tickets in front of us, so it would be another 30 minutes. At this point the table next to us who sat down after us was finishing their dessert. at 9:30 we asked about our food again and were told there were two tickets in front of us. To which we said, please cancel our order, we've eaten so many chips we aren't even hungry anymore. Offering no apology whatsoever, it took them an additional 20 minutes to bring the check for our drinks. Who knows how the food is, you may never get it!"}
{"text":"Hot Taco is completely off the hook!! Food, Drinks, Atmosphere. ..all amazing! I ordered the mini street taco platter...every one of the tacos was good, with super special praise for the carnitas, the as ads and the molida!!! wow! Moved from Cali to the Charlotte area over a year ago and finally discovered South End. Great neighborhood with an excellent Mexican joint. Feel like I am home in central Cali having a great meal and an awesome margie!!! Will definitely be coming back and people with me!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and great food! The pork belly was delicious. I has it with the street corn and ordered a side of tortillas."}
{"text":"Cheap beers, use Yelp deal for an appetizer. I enjoyed the tacos. 

But my cheese enchilada, rice and beans were terrible, not sure how you mess those up it mission accomplished. 

Salsa is good.

Our waitress was very kind. Would and will never go back."}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes before we got menus. Two different waitresses came to take our drink order and it took 20 minutes to receive a watery margarita. I had to take my order to go because it took 40 minutes for tacos... which were awful. We should have gone to Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Four stars for the drinks but zero for the food. The signature margarita and corona-Rita were good but the food was very bland. If we return it's only to get drinks."}
{"text":"Met up with a group of about eight friends after work at Hot Taco. Great atmosphere, cool decor, and cheap drink specials. The service was not great, but we had a big group and it was a busy night so I won't hold that against them too much. 

I had the Taco Loco salad, which was very good. The chicken portion was great and the chipotle ranch dressing had just enough zing to it to wake you up. Only bad part of the salad was that some of the avocados did not exactly look fresh. 

I had been to Hot Taco before and had about the same experience. Nothing to die for, but good enough to have a few drinks and get your taco fix for the week."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting for our table and had great service. Once we got to our table it all changed. It took 30 minutes to get a drink. We waiting an hour and a half and asked our server to check on our food. She said it wasn't even close to being up. We watched multiple tables just get up and leave and we ended up doing the same. Spending over two hours in a restaurant and never being served your food is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Why are the reviews so low?? Hot Taco ..... love the tacos, they have a Late Night $2 taco menu, $2 taco Tuesday and during a regular day try the taco sampler so you can enjoy variety of tacos. 

Margaritas always a good look! 

Pros: Pork Taco!!! cheap tacos, nice variety of tacos, sauce var, has tons of tequilas, tvs all over to watch games, patio to eat & drink, next door to other fun spots, free parking and rail access. 

Cons: late night menu is only 4 diff tacos and two other offerings, Guacamole wasn't good."}
{"text":"What a great place for weekend mimosas! $6 crafts with a porch where you can bring your pooch?!? What is better? The service has always been friendly, and what other place can you sit on a snake skin (fake) booths? Oh man...."}
{"text":"I always hear about Hot Taco and finally visited with a friend on Taco Tuesday (5:00pm).I wasn't that impressed.The quality and taste of the food was not the best. It is not somewhere I would crave or plan to visit again. However,my margarita was really good!! Our server wasn't that pleased to be at work either as evidenced by her lack of attention to our table and impatience when we requested something.FYI,it was only two of us!"}
{"text":"So I like this place. HOWEVER. After having gone three times in the last few weeks (kids eat free Monday's woot) I had to write a review. First off, I like the vibe, and that's important to me, so kudos for that. Big, roomy booths and really big, cool place. Here's the scoop. I like taco salad, I just do. It's not exciting, but I dig it. The first time we went I got the taco salad and it was good! Not fancy, but a solid yummy taco salad and I was not offended, so the second time I decided to get it again, and it was even better! I figured that the last time had been a fluke, even though it had been good, but that THIS was the way they initially intended to make it! It was MUCH larger (like twice the size) and had all kinds of avocado on it which had not been there the first time, and was so fresh. It was amazing. So naturally, the third time, I was pretty confident in ordering the taco salad again. But no such luck! It was the worst one yet! It was much smaller than the previous two, the chicken tasted kind of like tuna fish, and it was a completely different dish for the third time in a row. Weird! 

So my review is this (and mind you, it's mostly just for taco salad, lol). It CAN be really good, but it's definitely hit or miss just because it's just not consistent. When it's good, it's really good, but when it's something entirely different for no apparent reason, it's just bleh. Other folks eating here with me say that it's not the best Mexican they've ever had, but it's not the worst, either. I'd give an extra half star if I could for being alongside the trolley rail trail, because we always bike when we come, and it's super convenient."}
{"text":"Its was blah. A basic typical mexican spot with basic cliche decorations. Waiter was horrible. Her vibe seemed faked and forced. Host was cute and nice. Food was decent. Not the best and not the worst. I came on sunday and the only reason i gave it three stars is because they had $1 mimosas. Say what lmaooo you know im tipsy writing this review lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic management. Very accommodating and helpful. They go above and beyond to please the customer. Good food, nice atmosphere, great place!"}
{"text":"I went here for their taco Tuesday special, 2 dollar tacos and mini margaritas, everything was delicious. I would definitely not pay the normal price for these tacos though, they are good but definitely not worth ten dollars for 2 tacos. They have lots of specials so I'd love to go back and try other things as well. I saw something about 1/2 price fajitas on Wednesday's!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I love coming here and the fish tacos are to die for. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hot Taco I really want to give you a higher rating than 3 stars but I just can't. It's a fun environment and a good location. Shoot even the food isn't that bad! But the service here is out of this world bad. I have been here multiple times and whether it is slammed or empty the service is always bad. It may be forgetting one of your tacos, forgetting to put cheese on your nachos, or taking 40 minutes to get your check. 

On the plus size Tuesday's they have two dollars margaritas and Thursday is dollar drafts."}
{"text":"Okay,
The manager invited me to come back and try a meal on him.
So I got the Steak and eggs off the brunch menu.
  The steak was cooked to perfection. It's amazing how different the food tastes when you put a Latino in the kitchen. Especially since it's a  Hispanic themed restaurant.
All rightee then! They've gotten their kitchen sorted out and everything is good.
So give them a try and let us know what you think.
Many thanks to Tim the manager.

{"text":"Food was not that bad! However, the service was beyond horrible it ruined everything."}
{"text":"Great location.  Great potential. The food was less than desirable and the service was slow. The Chicken Chimichanga was burnt... and who makes a Chimichanga filled with a couple shreds of  chicken and packed with rice .. then served with a side of the same rice?? I'm not even sure how to explain those refried beans. What was that seasonning??"}
{"text":"Please trust the rating and all other similar reviews before you go here (Don't be like me and not trust the reviews and 'go and try it yourself'). It looks like a really cool ~trendy~ spot to go to, but trust me (and all other yelpers) that this place is not worth it. Very disappointing. 

Everything looks a lot better than it tastes. Less than average tacos, quesadillas, even chips and salsa (and they have a salsa bar). I've been here both for dinner and \"brunch\" and both times were 'eh'. The food isn't garbage, but is not the quality that you would expect for such a busy area and a great location. I've also gotten a margarita and mimosa from here and both had the similar reaction of \"eh. It's not really bad, just not exactly good or what I was expecting/hoping for.\"

They have outside seating with TVs, which was a plus. The inside decor and seating areas were very cool (with TVs as well). Other than Hot Taco having a great location and really cool and interesting decorations, there food is really just a waste of money."}
{"text":"ROACHES!!!!!!!
Honestly, 0 stars from me.. 
I came here for a friend's birthday where the table was already set with fresh chips and salsa. Great start until we were actually ready to order and there was not a waitress in sight. Mind, our dinner started at 7 pm and we did not receive our dinner until 8:30 pm.. we ate nothing but chips the whole hour and half so by the time the food came we were stuffed. My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and was given MY chicken quesadilla which they took back after she took one bite and realized it wasn't what she ordered. This happened to another friend who was also apart of the party but it was exactly what she ordered and the waitress continued to just take it away from her. By the time the shrimp and chicken quesadillas came out they were soggy and again we were not hungry at the time. My meal totaled $19.00 and that is counting a $7.00 queso which I've never had to spend that much at a Mexican restaurant before... especially for a quesadilla and queso. And for a tablespoon of guacamole was an EXTRA $2.00. 
Never again!
Oh yeah.. and we saw one of the waiters kicking and stepping on roaches right by our table in the kitchen...
You're welcome"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever had. The food is not at all how it's described on the menu. The quesadilla is described has having three cheese, but any evidence of cheese was invisible to me. Never will I spend money here again."}
{"text":"The location and the atmosphere are fun. The food: YUCK. I'm not that picky, but the salsa, the beans, and the carnitas were all so heavily salted it was like eating brine. Also, the carnitas were exuding gobs of amber colored oil which saturated the rice underneath it with a brown, tobacco looking slime. Unappetizing to the 10th degree. The guacamole, however, was good.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I could have had a better (and much cheaper) meal at Taco Bell.

Want decent Mexican in the greater Charlotte area? Head to Monterrey in Pineville."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch, very disappointed. Chips were stale and salsa was watery and bland. I'm a huge Mexican food fanatic. I got two tacos: the Korean BBQ steak taco and the bang bang fish taco. The BBQ steak taco tasted like it came out of a can. The meat did not taste like real meat. I will not be back!!! Expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Just go here. Go here for taco Tuesday for the great specials. Go and pay full price because it's amazing. Every single thing we tried was great. I didn't take pictures because it was too good to stop stuffing my face. I really like the decor and the service was prompt and very friendly.  Go now. Stop reading and leave. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Came here during the halftime of the football game I was watching next door at All-American Pub and was surprised at how fast they took my order and served it to me. Real fast service even while they were busy.

I simply had tacos which were good. 

I ordered, ate, paid, and was able to get back to the game in time to watch the rest of the game so that worked out really well. Can't ask for more

Fast service, good food :)"}
{"text":"Our table specialist, Destiny, is amazing! Please try the taco sampler appetizer! Awesome ambiance, food and tequila flights for all to enjoy. If you're torn about the cocktails menu, you can't lose with the Bel-Air. Olè!"}
{"text":"The food is not good, nor is the service.  My wife and her friends had been here before for their drinks (Margaritas, etc), and I was told prior to going that the food was average.  We went there for Mother's day 2016 - everyone in our party was Mexican, but me..  It took 15 minutes after we were seated to have our server Erin come over and greet us and take our drink orders.  She seemed like she didn't want to be there that day; she never smiled, she was monotone, and literally did everything thing in the book to lessen her tip.  

We had a party of 6 and sat outside(eventually 7) - we were seated at two small round tables that were pushed together.  These small tables are fine for small parties, but not for larger groups in a communal setting.  When our app's (guacamole fresco, queso blanco con chorizo - we ordered the fried jalapenos later..) came out, we couldn't even share across tables b/c you had to actually stand up or pass the app over to the other person.  

\"Hot Taco\" this is something you should consider on the patio; a 4'x8' rectangle for larger parties.  

After placing our drink order it took another 10 minutes to get the WATER to our table, and the margaritas and other mixed drinks took even longer.  I will say that she told us that they are short a server, but that is not my problem, and I'm sure she could've walked faster if she wanted to.  Regardless, the service was painfully slow, for everything, and we were rarely \"checked upon\".  Hot Taco was NOT slammed that day, nor near reaching full capacity.  Their website says their looking for motivated people to hire.  I think they're failing on that aspect.  

The only reason we went there was b/c my MIL wanted a good Margarita.  She was pleased with her drink, but commented that the food was 'okay', which is her way of saying \"not good\".  I agree, the food was not good.  My wife had the Korean Beef Tacos, if I were to grade on presentation, it would've been a 3/10.  Taste 5/10.  The paltry amount of beans and rice they give you is sad, as was the taste of it.  My father in law had the fish tacos.  This is a man known for eating anything, at anytime, anywhere, regardless of when his last meal was.  He didn't finish the tacos, nor the beans and rice.  

The guacamole came out in a big glob on a big plate with two tortilla chips stuck into it (my MIL did verify it was fresh, but it needed more salt and lime juice)...  The queso con chorizo was terrible.  The tortilla chips they serve, sub-par.  The Queso con chorizo comes in this little skillet that sits atop a little holder that has a little candle underneath it to keep it from congealing.  The candle is worthless, and it thickened rather quickly.  The fried jalapenos weren't that great either.  There was actually one left at the end of the night if that says anything.  Erin talked us into the \"fried cheese cake\" - it wasn't that good either, and it was fried!!  What fried food isn't good?  Hot Taco's fried food apparently.      

I guess they also have a small selection for the music they play.  For first 3/4 of our time there, all we heard was Reggaeton?!  I guess that's part of the \"hip\" vibe they're going for? \"Um, how about some Vicente Fernandez, or Ana Gabriel?\".  Once the Reggaeton playlist played out, then came some Merengue and other upbeat Hispanic club classics.  My wife and her friends commented on how they heard the same songs the last time.  

For the prices they're asking, you're better off going to a 'Real Mexican' restaurant - if you want real Mexican food (This food is the Americanized version of Mexican, seriously).  If you want to appear trendy and say you ate uptown, and you like bad service and sub-par food, then eat here.  

I rarely tip less than 20%, but on this day, our bill came to $147.xx, and I tipped just under 15% (if I had the heart, I would've tipped less)...  Again, the service was slow and simply unpleasant, the food was not good, and when our meals came out, they came out in pairs, not altogether, in 3-4 minute intervals...  Bottom line, if you want a good drink, I 'guess' you could go here, but if you want real Mexican food look elsewhere.

The only thing good I can say about my first and last visit to Hot Taco is that the decor was pretty cool, inside and out, but you can't eat the decor..."}

I've never paid an entry fee here so I asked what time they started charging and a few other questions to see if I'm dealing with a hustler. Upon realizing this was the case, our group proceeded to go next door and the guy stopped us and said he was just messing with us."}
{"text":"The location couldn't be better... it's located directly on the Rail Trail and nearby my apartment. 

However, that's the best part about this place. 

The tacos are sub-par. Not very interesting and not very flavorful. 

One time I came and they had run out of chips... that's ridiculous. What is a Mexican restaurant without chips?

Service is hit or miss. Sometimes it can be very slow, but everyone is generally nice. 

I know there is a huge weekend bar scene here. So maybe the food isn't their focus. 

There are better places in CLT to get Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Hot Taco today...what a waste of money. First, we kept getting calls back saying they were out of things...either update yoour menu online saying that you don't sell these things anymore, or make sure you actually have the items that you sell in stock? How are you out of corn....at a Mexican restaurant? Once we got our food, my wife had the taco salad and it was decent, we both thought the flour taco shell tasted gross though, like it was fried in old oil. My enchiladas came with no sauce, no toppings as described in the menu, just some bits of shredded cheese...with gross black beans and old crunchy Mexican rice. The guacamole had no salt or lime, just blended avocados topped with tomatoes, the chips were stale, the quest wasn't bad though. All in all, seems like a classic case of a place that's all show and location, but the food is garbage."}
{"text":"In town for a short visit with our baseball working Funkette.  She picked us up at CLT-Douglas about 11AM and we decided on a quick bite for lunch.

Hot Tacos it was in the Old Southside neighborhood.  So it's $2 Tuesdays...that's $2 Taco's and $2 \"mini margarita's\". Lots of choices on the taco front... from fish, to chicken, carne aside, pulled pork, Koren, shrimp...you get the picture.  Hard shells, soft corn, flour...you pick that too.  

Baja Fish - Flakey white fish grilled, blackened or fried. Served with pico de gallo, citrus slaw and spicy seafood creama.  Pretty good but the pico really cooled down the fish pieces just as others have stated.

Al Pastor - Hand pulled pork with pineapple, onion and cilantro. Good flavor, but the pork was on the fatty side.

Tobasco Chicken - Pulled chicken with citrus cabbage, cilantro and topped with Tabasco creama.  Hot and spicy.

Camarones Caliente - Fried shrimp tossed in house made hot sauce made with Tapatio and Ranchero salsa, Bleu cheese slaw, tomatoes and fresh scallions.  Tasty but not enough shrimp.

The mini margarita's were basic yet met our expectations for what eight two-bit pieces of silver should get you.  We three shared four.

Chips and salsa were decent but we've had better.

All in all would the lunch command a repeat?  Sure, why not.  The math was easy to figure the bill."}
{"text":"This place can leave you a little confused on how you actually feel about it. If you go sit at the bar my experiences there are usually pretty good in all areas of service food and drinks. In fact if I could rate the bar and dining room separately I would. The bartenders have always seemed knowledgable and are always friendly. The food has always made me happy I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD and to be honest I'm not really all that picky about it I could it all day everyday. The chips and salsa are amazing they are always freshly made and the salsa is amazing. They have great specials for drinks and food all week long $2 tacos on Tuesdays and half price fajitas on weds (I think).

The only thing that has consistently disappointed me has been when I've sat anywhere but the bar (haven't tried the patio yet) I sat in a booth the other night with friend we were so excited to go there for the $2 taco and margarita night. It took forever to get sat they said they were letting the kitchen catch up..... To what I don't know because the place was only about half full maybe a little more. The only thing that was busy was the bar... Much to my dismay.... Finally we were sat things stated out ok but it just seemed like we could never get our server when we needed her. The food came out great and at a good pace so it seemed they had caught up.  And as a friendly tip stick to the drinks they know I ordered a vodka soda... Seemingly simple enough...but it came out in a large margarita glass, my immediate thought was ooook so I'm gonna have a ton of soda water in here, so I tried it and it was a little vodka and a ton of just plain tap water really gross :/ I asked our server if hey could remake it maybe the carbonation was out and if I could have it in a rocks glass so that it wasn't completely watered down. She replied they were out of rocks glasses and walked off soooo I assumed I was getting the same next time.  It came out this time in a rocks glass with NO VODKA in it. I repeat NO VODKA only soda water. 

Needless to say there's a lot of good things they do but when you go stick to the things they do good. Pretty good food and cheap drinks that are on their menu.

Parking can be an issue at busy times but overall a good stop in for drinks and food we'll be back."}
{"text":"me and my friends like to come here often on Sunday's for their $5 pitcher mimosas, however, this time we had the most rudest dull waitress ever named Leslie. Gave me and my friends attitude every time we asked for something. She was nice to her other tables and was disrespectful to us. She acted as if she never wanted to serve us, brought our food and practically threw it on the table. Worse half a** customer service ever."}
{"text":"Let me lead with the good... our server was so nice! Four of us went for lunch and it was pretty dead. Chips and salsa were fine. We ordered guacamole and it came out premade. Nothing special. I ordered 2 tacos with beans and rice. One of my tacos was supposed to be blackened chicken. There was nothing blackened about it. I didn't even dare try to eat it. I picked off a tiny piece and it was so bland. Blah! We got a pitcher of margaritas - kind of by accident - our server asked if we were ready, we said, \"Yes.\", and a few minutes later a pitcher appeared on our table. Oops. But, fine, we must have looked like we needed it. The margarita was strong. Maybe a tad too strong.  Not a ton of flavor. Just ok. I would not race back to Hot Taco. I'll probably stick with my tried and true Mexican hotspots!"}
{"text":"went to Hot Taco  on a Monday night and ordered 2 margaritas off the menu and a chicken burrito ...

1) $15  \" Specialty cilantro Margarita\"  tasted like straight up grass clippings 
2) Waitress failed to mention the \" house\"  margarita was 50% off on Mondays when we ordered our drinks . When asked about it later on she said \" sorry I cant help you theres no button for that \" ..house margs were $4 vs $15 (specialty) 
3) \"chicken \" burrito was really just a \"rice burrito \" with a few tiny pieces of shredded chicken
4) For $75 total we got chips / salsa/ queso/ rice burrito / two grass clipping margaritas and chicken fajitas. just left feeling ripped off and questioning the staff.

i have respect for service industry workers and this was my first time ever complaining to them about the service/ food quality in my life..also the first time i was compelled to write a Yelp review .

 was very disappointed with the food, drinks, service, will not be going back and dont recommend to anyone go either . . much better mexican all over charlotte"}
{"text":"This place sucked even more the second time I came here.  I really hate this place.  Came in....given, it was cinco de mayo....stood at the hostess stand for  greater than 10 minutes, never got spoken to by a server, despite her coming by several times to check her phone.  Never got service...so I left.  I really hate this place.  Never come here"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it was just terrible in every way possible. I wanted to try it for the longest time because I love all American/slate/oak room. The service was terrible. We were one of about 6 tables and took about 10 minutes to get our margaritas and they honestly weren't anything great. The food was beyond gross. The chicken in my taco had a bone in it and was extremely fatty (I pulled out about 3 large pieces of chicken skin). I ate about 3 bites off my whole plate. Only decent thing was the salsa. Save your money and go next door."}
{"text":"Great specials throughout the week, especially on Tuesdays with $2 tacos, mini margaritas, etc.  The food is great with generous portions, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We go every friday....the food is great, especially the empanadas....the staff is excellent, especially destiny....she is the best waitress we have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Taco Tuesday here for as long as they have been open. I loved having a trendy place to bring clients for an inexpensive night out. Who can beat $2 shrimp, Korean BBQ, and more exciting flavored tacos? No holds barred on any of the 12 or so taco flavors on the menu! I've come here with my family and friends as well and we always left with smiles and full stomachs.

Welp, all good things must come to an end.  

After months of great food and service, they have suddenly fallen completely off. The choices of $2 tacos are now limited to 5 flavors (if you guessed that it is the 5 most basic tacos, you are correct). The ones I had were oozing with grease in every bite. My appetizer didn't even show up until I was done eating. One of my party had to request the correct drink 3 times before they got it right. Another was given the wrong tacos altogether... It was just a nightmare. 

From the wait being double what we were quoted to the time it took for food to arrive, everything was just wrong. Not to mention they have now dropped to a 90 sanitation score. This will be my last visit.

R.I.P. Hot Taco."}
{"text":"Hot Taco is a solid choice if you are looking for some tacos in the South End area. The chips and salsa that you get when you sit down are pretty good. If the salsa you get isn't your thing, you have the option to go to the salsa bar and choose from a number of difference salsas with different sorts of tastes and sauce levels. When we went it was a little busy, but not too busy for 7PM on a Friday night.

FAIR WARNING: Pay attention to the heat levels. I had the bang bang fish tacos which are rated \"5 skulls\". I figured it shouldn't be too bad as I have had ghost chili peppers without too much trouble. These things are nuclear! Probably one of my poorer life choice - the first bite was good, but the second bite was agony for the next 12 hours."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my free appetizer and the atmosphere! $6 pitcher mimosas makes a Sunday a fun day!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good. I had the appetizer sampler And it was enough food to fill me up. I liked the buffalo shrimp taco the best. I also tasted the buffalo shrimp quesadilla and it was good. Margaritas were okay. I would visit again. Friendly bartender."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch about two months ago with my boyfriend around 3pm.. we wanted to sit outside because it was so nice out. The sign outside says \"please see hostess inside for patio seating\" so we step inside... not a soul to be seen besides customers at a few tables. No hostess, no one behind the bar, no server to be found, no manager, no greeting. We stood there at the entrance near the bar and waited for about 5 minutes before realizing that this must be the reason hardly anyone goes there. Besides the food being subpar, customer service seems to be at an all time low. Just before turning away and leaving a CUSTOMER yells out \"you can just seat yourself\" ...ahhh no, thanks though. We took our business next door to Tavern on the tracks and won't be returning."}
{"text":"If restaurant hell exists it really will be at hot taco. I guess the name is fitting. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant until the moment I left I was unimpressed, disappointed and angry. 

Me and my work buddies wanted to try a place for taco Tuesdays so we went here. You'd think the restaurant would be prepared for such an event. Inside we had a waitress who took forever (took 20 mins to get waters), she wouldn't refill our chips and complained to us how the restaurant shouldn't even have such things as taco Tuesdays. When it was time to leave the bills were wrong. I left angry and vowing to never return."}
{"text":"What a mess.
Came here in a Tues...Taco Tuesday no less and believe the stars. The food is trash and the service is trash. Fortunately the location is the BRIGHT SPOT but as far as the food is trash. The owners or proprietors should be ashamed. I has a Carne Asada taco --2 and they were trash. The service started out good but failed. Ended up having to go to the bathroom close out bill. 
I will NOT be back bc this was a major fail. Also the restroom had no toilet tissue and I had to \"Seinfeld\"  my situation to get tissue. Sigh.
Don't bother with this place. The drinks are watery, service sucks and food lacks flavor. Don't bother with this place it's a DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"Hot Taco has gone from awesome to awful.  Our last two experiences were not good.  First, on a Tuesday night, four of us just sat there for no kidding ten minutes waiting for our server to come by.  When we got up to leave, the host said not to leave because our waitress was coming.  Sorry, too long for an empty Tuesday night.

Second experience was especially frustrating.  We had a group of six on Friday, March 11.  The tacos were all dry and not very good.  But what really irked me was our waitress.  I paid cash and was supposed to get $17 change, but I only received $12.  I assumed it was an honest mistake.  I sat there for about five minutes before I approached our waitress; she immediately pulled the missing $5 out of her boot and said, \"oh yeah I was going to come back, I thought I may have forgotten to give you change.\"  I literally didn't even say anything to her, she just blurted that out after me watching her go about her normal business for five minutes.  Honest mistake?  Maybe.

Won't be going back to Hot Taco until they clean up their act."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after chilling at slate for a while late at night and needing food. There was literally NO One else in the whole place which was surprising with all the bars around and them being the only place still serving food. Not to mention they offer $2 tacos late night which made it even more surprising that no one was there for cheap tacos after a night of drinking. We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender for a while who was friendly. We, of course, went with some of the $2 tacos. I had a chicken and a beef taco and they were both pretty good. For the price and convenience it was good. I don't necessarily understand the low reviews here but my experience was good(albeit nobody else being in the restaurant)."}
{"text":"Good Chips... Everything else is just average.

Some friends and I went to Hot Taco for dinner after having some drinks in that part of town.  The chips the bright or were very good.  So that went well.

Everything else did not.  The service was very very slow.  It got to where we were ordering two drinks at a time because the service was so slow.

I got two tacos for dinner, they were good, not great.  I don't remember much about them other than they were just ok.  They do offer corn tortillas, which I like very much.  So that was nice.

Overall it was average.  Won't make any specify trips there any time soon.  But if a group is going, I won't argue."}
{"text":"We came here mostly for the location since it's near the light rail and all the breweries. The food was decent but I wouldn't recommend the strawberry margarita I got. They use the app No Wait so we didn't have to wait too long for our table.  Not sure we'd go back again, but if you're craving Mexican and in the area it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I was traveling for work and this place was recommended to me by a friend. The tacos were great and the service was very prompt, which is important when you're traveling!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because this place has been decent before..pretty darn tasty tacos actually. However, we went for National Taco Day (last Wednesday), which they were doing $2 tacos from a limited menu. 3 out of 4 orders were wrong, the tacos and quesadillas were TERRIBLE and took an extremely long time to receive. The waitress was nice and friendly, but SLOW. There were maybe 10-15 occupied tables when we were there later in the evening.

Summary: Friendly but slow staff, disgusting food that was not accurate to our orders. Taco Bell would have been a tastier, quicker, less expensive way to do National Taco Day."}
{"text":"Joy and Noel were fantastic, even on the busiest of taco Tuesday's! Great attitude and smiles despite the crowd. Food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and so did everyone else in the party! We went on Friday, after the panther pep rally in uptown. It was about 2 o'clock, the server wasn't the nicest, (also knowing we had never been there before) however the food was great and all of the other servers that helped take care of our table were awesome as well. The service was fast. Of course when you go to a Mexican restaurant most people get the combination plates and that's exactly what we did. The salsa is good, it does have a little kick which I loved. I got the chicken quesadilla and steak taco. I really like the refried beans. Charlotte definitely needs more Mexican restaurants that are decent, finally SouthEnd has one. Will definitely go back, and just hope to have a nicer server next time."}
{"text":"No bueno.  Hot Taco is just as bad as its ugly twin next door. The atmosphere is great but service and food here is lacking in the quality department.  

It was just last Thursday and I ordered two tequila shots... what came out still haunts me.  Aside from them coming out warm and not chilled.  One shot glass had the usual: salt, lime, tequila; the other...salt, ORANGE, tequila.  I literally did a double take and as the waitress saw the horror on my face, which she explained they ran out of limes and thought an orange would suffice.  Whatcha talkin' about Willis? This is a Mexican restaurant you can't run out of limes and there is a Publix right up the street, have someone get more.  That's like ordering guacamole and they say, \"Sorry ran out of avocados, but we have tomatoes!\"  Just let us know before you make that kind of decision for us, it was insulting and sounded lazy.
 
The second \"hiccup\" up of the evening was ordering a side of refried beans.  I don't know what is worst, finding out Santa isn't real or the refried beans at Hot Taco.  No one does a better job of describing what I received than Outkast. \"What's cooler than cool... Ice Cold!\"  Thankfully I wasn't charged for it, but seriously why was it half frozen? *Insert thinking emoji*  The people want to know.
 
I will say the staff was nice and trying their best that night, but swing and a miss on every other category.
 
Hot Taco you need to be better, this is South End, stop being an amateur.  However, I will most likely be back, not because of the food, service or drinks.  But, because it's there."}
{"text":"Hot Taco may have the best weekend drink specials in the uptown/southend neighborhoods, great for cheap beer and mimosas. Food wise, it's a pretty basic Mexican menu. 2¢ - get the queso"}
{"text":"Good food - good server - good price and great ambiance. This place should be a staple. Whoever did the interior design is good - fun and well executed. Glad Charlotte has a joint like this."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night, and it was fairly busy. Our waitress was very nice and understanding because we were suppose to have a party for 8, and some of our friends had Uber problems and were 45 mins late and our waitress let us order before they even got there, which was nice. I got the nachos and my husband got the the biggest taco i have ever seen, i forget what it was called but it was HUGE. They were both good. Typical Tex Mex food. I cant say it was extraordinary it was just like typical mexican food. They also had a hot sauce bar which i loved, it had all kinds of different hot sauces you could choose from. I got the champagne margarita which was delicious. The spicy margarita, was not good at all, it was more sweet than actually spicy and it was like fruity sweet not even margarita sweet. I did not enjoy that one at all. Overall is was a good tex-mex restaurant. Oh yea they were also out of a lot of alcohol that we asked for, which was frustrating because if they have it on their menu they should have it in stock. Also the prices were pretty pricey for the food and drinks."}
{"text":"I love love love the patio and atmosphere of this place.  However, the service was not so great and the margarita was awful.  I did have a vegetarian taco that was pretty good so all was not lost."}
{"text":"If I could leave a lower score I would wasted my money here one day when me and friend left the nail salon and wanted to get some food we don't live around this area so we just stumbled upon this place it was a disappointment it wasn't the cleanest place the salsa taste like ketchup the chicken queso was cold only thing decent was the refried beans I will never come back here"}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte for a few days and my buddy thought tacos sounded about right. Taco Tuesday offers $2 margaritas and $2 tacos! We sprung for the house margaritas because we wanted better tequila, they were good. Tacos were very good!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before on a Sunday afternoon and quite enjoyed it so thought we would give it another try....never again! We were there on a Saturday night and although it was busy, it was not packed. Our first drinks came quickly along with chips and salsa...which was delicious.  After that we probably didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes. Our first drinks were long gone...we were starving and had been ready to order well over half an hour prior. We were so disgusted that we decided to just leave but the waitress brought our bill and never returned again. 20 minutes later we eventually settled up with the bar. Graciously the bartender removed one of our drinks. So needless to say the hour and a half wait I experienced was not worth the 1 mediocre Margarita! Went next door to the American pub and told our story..the staff was all over us. The manager even comped our first round of drinks and appetizers without us even asking!!! Now that's were I will frequent"}
{"text":"I never give reviews but I feel like I have to this time. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My waiter Heather (I believe) was very unprofessional. While getting our drink order a friend of mind was talking about a taco and how he might not like it she responds with \"you gone hush and eat it\" She was told not to speak in that manner and she responded with \"I analyze my tables before I come over to make sure they can handle my mouth\" what does that sound like to you? Very stereotypical. So based upon how the table looks determines how you treat them. And to top it off, she would curse describing the menu. Saying things like \"it has a little sh*t on it\" or things of the sort. She said shit about 6 times. I couldn't believe it. Very Professional. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience we have had at a restaurant. Sat outside for 5-10 minutes while two waitresses passed us and no one said anything. No one welcomed us after we were seated, no one asked if we wanted anything until we said we were leaving. 

We will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Despite the poor reviews this place has received, some friends and I stopped by for dinner one night last week. I am glad we ignored the low ratings; I thought this place was great!

The vibe is casual; kind of teetering on the edge of hokey with its decor, but no big deal. The service was great; our waitress was super friendly and diligent about checking in on us, and our food arrived quickly. 

Now, about the food: it was REALLY good. I'm not sure if previous reviewers have extremely high standards, or if I have extremely low standards. In any case, I have no complaints about anything I ordered (#11 and taquitos appetizer, for the record). My dining companions were very happy with their meal as well (although I can't recall what they ordered). 

I live a few miles away in Wesley Heights. To this point, if I wanted tasty Mexican food, I'd drive to 1900 in Elizabeth. I actually think 1900 is an eensy bit better but the convenient location of Hot Taco, combined with my positive experience, has it currently ranked as my new go-to Mexican joint. 

I hope future meals here are just as good as this one, for myself, as well as other diners."}
{"text":"If you like poor service and food, head to Hot Taco! After multiple attempts of trying Hot Taco thinking \"maybe it will be better this time\" I am disappointed time and again. The service is slow, they mess up your food on a consistent basis and don't do much to remedy the problem. However, they do have good specials which kept me interested. The final straw was this weekend when I ordered a bowl of queso (the only bearable thing on their menu) and after waiting 10-15 minutes, was given a very small bowl (smaller than their normal size-think the size of ranch dipping), still charged $7 and they had changed the queso without warning me when I ordered it!! It tasted like the Tostitos jars of queso. Never giving my money to this establishment again!!! The WORST OVERPRICED Mexican food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First Tuesday $2 tacos was great the second time I went not so much. Service was bad and food did not have the same quality as the first time. Maybe we got lucky!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. Well we waited forever to get our food. Not sure if it's any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day, the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait. What a shame. 

Doubt I will be back. Service was awful.

Still can't believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because 1.5 of those is for our waitress alone. It took 30+ minutes for us to be seated, the venue was not packed. Once we were seated, we sat for about 15 min with no drinks. Our waitress came over, apologized because she didn't know we were her section and took our app and drink orders. We got the guacamole, freshly made in house - which made me excited. It wasn't bad. The veggie tacos though, if the veggies were supposed to be cooked they did a terrible job. We really could not leave soon enough. And the icing on the cake, I left with an instant stomach ache."}
{"text":"The food here is NOT good. Everything came out cold. I got the Baja fish tacos (fried) - the fish was hard and stale...like the consistency of stale fries at a McDonalds. The Korean beef tacos was not any better - it was supposed to have a Korean/ Mexican BBQ sauce but it tastes like Mesquite BBQ sauce. I couldn't even finish that one.

Someone at our table got the Shrimp Diablo which was supposed to be spicy and \"not for beginners\"...huge disappointment. On a level of 1-10 on the hot scale it was a 1.

Nobody at our table finished our plates."}
{"text":"Came in on. Tuesday for lunch. Let's hope dinners later in the week are better.  It's too bad. No martini glasses so it came in a champagne flute. Took way too long to get our drinks. Let me say that again, WAY TOO LONG. We had six tacos between the two of us. Mine were tasteless. Chicken, beef, steak. The other three were blah. Fried fish was terrible. Shrimp was ok and grilled fish was ok. Tres Leches was awful. Service blah. No need to return. Many better places to go. No wonder they have so many daily specials."}
{"text":"Seems like an average place with average food. 

We only stopped in for a drink but I also utilized the free appetizer offered from the Yelp app! We enjoyed several margaritas and some guacamole. 

The guacamole was decent, however my complaint comes with the tomatoes. There were WAY to many. However it did taste fresh, and had all the right flavors. Next time l will ask that they hold off on topping it with several large scoops of tomatoes. 

Hoping to come back and try some other dishes and give this place a better review!"}
{"text":"The fajita-rito is life changing. You can get it in a bowl to make it a little lighter. The Chevelle is my favorite cocktail on the menu. Light and perfectly sweet/spicy."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Hot Taco three times. Overall, I think they should have put as much time creating a good menu as they did decorating the place. Great decor, mediocre food. Considering they own so many restaurants and have a place across the street from Taco Boy (Folly Beach) I'm surprised they missed the boat on this one. Then again, since they are next to All-American and Oak Room, they can get away with mediocre food and they know that."}
{"text":"This restaurant never has good service nor have I ever been delivered hot food. This is consistent whether they are busy or not."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot but dead for a Sat.night at 11pm. If you check in through the Yelp app, you get a free appetizer.

Food: 8/10
Service: 10/10
Atmosphere: 10/10"}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar, host didn't say anything to us upon entrance, my wife got a watered down frozen margarita. Don't Eat Here!! Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Manager agreed wheels fell off"}
{"text":"The service is awful. Just got up and walked out. They have Tuesday specials and I guess they were overwhelmed. Sat with my husband and daughter for over 15 minutes with NO SERVER or manager coming over. At least the gentleman cleaning tables took pity on us and gave us chips and salsa. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're desperate. Go to Phat Burritto it's close by."}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst service I've ever received. I do not recommend It. Our waitress never checked on us and we had to ask another waitress for service. This is a very slow Thursday night and they are having trouble serving us. I'm writing this review as it's all happening."}
{"text":"You get a 3 for having $2 tacos on Tuesday. Hard to beat that. However. My tacos were cold and missing half the toppings the menu said it came with. Like my bbq taco? Missing BBQ. Korean taco? No sauce. Just dry meat. Cheap should not equal bad. Otherwise I will stick with taco bell.

Also took 15 minutes for a waitress to notice us. And we kept getting random wrong orders delivered to our table all night. The waitress had the nerve to get annoyed with us for turning the food away repeatedly - really?? 

Not impressed."}
{"text":"I must have really been enamored with Hot Taco but let me warn you: SERVICE SUCKS. 
It's sporadic at best and inconsistent on a good day. Yeah, I know sounds like semantics but it's not. They have different definitions and HotTaco proves it. 

Went Tuesday after 9pm and was told there's a 45m -1 hour wait. No biggie but I left after 10 minutes. I'm happy they have a dedicated hostess now and they'll text you when your party can be seated. Returned  Wednesday at 5p and was amazed how many people were present. Took a while to get a server to acknowledge me and she was decent when she did. 

The $8 FROZEN mango margarita was not good. Had less flavor than the lime and  sugar rim. 
I didn't ska daddle over to the salsa bar this time BUT for the 1st time ever... 
I
TRIED
THE 
CHORIZO 
EMPANADAS
and..... YES Lord!

Look, I don't care for the chorizo on the queso as the pork is greasy. It just is. 
But whomever they decided to hire to cook midday got these empanadas all the way right. 
I thought about them today as I enjoy the left overs. 

Warning they come on a bed of diced tomatoes with a salsa for dipping and a sour cream based decorated with zig zags on the plate. 

I meant to take pictures as they were light, airy, crispy, velvety and was not overstuffed nor greasy. The dough was reminiscent of Phyllo for Greek dishes. 

Well, let me wrap up with: Don't expect much for service. This is Tex-Mex fusion at best. Quit with the authentic gripes. I'm starting to think: Y'all would go to Mexico and complain. 
Tuesday margaritas range from watered down to salty BUT HEY they're $2 and that's what 'cha get. 
Portions vary based on who showed up for work. 
None of the deals are to go. Must dine in. 
Lids don't always fit the cup sizes they bring out hence I dropped sour cream when walking out from work while wearing sandals. Why? Lid too small for the cup size. 
Fajita shrimps can be large or small. 
Rice may be salty or done just right. 
Refried Beans may be old or fresh & tasty
You'll always only get 3 tortillas no matter the size of the skillet. 
You'll get more lettuce and pico than Sour Cream AND especially NOT the cheese on the setup but hey~ IT\"S HALF OFF ... DEAL!

With all that, HotTaco still gets 4 stars and they lost 1 due to that service issue. Look at my check-ins; I think I have enough credibility to state: the service is whack. 

Get the empanadas, queso, guac, stuffed jalapenos, street corn and Hot shrimp
Get the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, fajita skillet, chimi and 
on the rocks original margarita or the 1 with the corona per my friends. I can't judge liquor."}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos were good, pulled pork tacos were average. The atmosphere and location is great, fun place to hang out with friends. The house margarita wasn't sour enough, but the sangria was a solid choice."}
{"text":"Eh- generic Mexi-American food. Nothing fancy. Had the fajitas (streak/chicken ) were good but ... didn't even get a choice of flour or corn or refried beans or black beans before the server walked away. Seemed to be her thing walking away as your talking. Didn't get a welcoming feeling from her or the hostess upon arrival. The steak a little dry, good chicken. Service was Kinda pricy for what you get unless you come for Taco Tuesday. So overall meh food and not a great attitude for customer service think it wasn't our place"}
{"text":"The most unflavorful burrito I have ever had. Slow service and overpriced. Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"Well, color me surprised... After one too many beers at Unknown, we ubered into Southend STARVINGOMGNEEDFOODTOSOAKUPTHEALCOHOLIMMEDIATELY. Unfortunately, we were greeted with an hour wait for our party of 8 at Futo Buta, so down the tracks we wandered. (Don't worry, we didn't actually walk ON the tracks.) And, behold... Hot Taco! I know what you're thinking... This isn't going to end well. But, I'm here to tell you, I think Hot Taco might have turned a corner! 

After reading so many bad reviews, I was nervous and might have grumbled a little bit when our dinner plans changed from delicious ramen to questionable Mexican, but again... Really pleased with the experience at Hot Taco! Service was spot on. Several friendly waitresses dealt with our drunk shenanigans and were super attentive. Chips and salsa came out immediately. Drinks were fairly cheap. ($6.50 for the house margarita.) Menu offered the usual Mexican fare -- tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc. I had the mole chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Solid plate of food! Ted had a burrito that was only slightly smaller than the state of Texas. 

I hope Hot Taco has hit their stride after a bumpy opening! I'm certainly excited to have a new spot in South End to stumble into after a few beers and regret staying away/judging a book by it's 3-star rating for so long."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place multiple times most of the visit are late night or when there's a huge event so it's been packed the wait list has been long the worse to expect but I've never complained because it was still a good service at the table fold was great and the drinks ..... well not this time the wait turned out to be an hour there were tables Available just dirty because they're clearly didn't have enough servers there were three people maybe four working .. we went to the bar to wait the bartender had a mess too and then we wait 30 mores for four basic margaritas.... sat down finally and the food tasted rotten we had steak tacos and we ordered 1800 and ok we got some coconut rum drink with oj ... my friend is allergic to coconut so we obviously told them we wanted 1800 again checks came by and the server had all the food and drinks mixed up she yelled cussed and even started throwing the checks because she couldn't figure out who ordered what took 20 minutes finally left and because I didn't tip I was really upset .. she yelled out well shit thanks bi*** so yes it was a mess that all happened in 3 hours too because they took forever"}
{"text":"The best thing I can say is that the chips and salsa are decent.  

Everything else is so mediocre it's a total waste to go here.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Where to even begin. I struggled with whether or not to even take the time out of my day to write a review considering Hot Taco's reviews are terrible anyway. Alas, here I am. This is a long post, so if you want the Reader's Digest version, I've summed up our experience at the bottom.

I had my first Hot Taco experience when I came in for my birthday back in April. I called the morning of and made a reservation for 10 people at 7:30 on a Saturday night. \"No problem!\" They said. Wellllllll....We get there, right on time mind you, and the hostesses looked confused when I gave them my name, then floundered and claimed that our table was \"being cleaned\" after we saw them look up my name in the system and their expressions made it clear that there was no reservation in my name. Once we got seated (25 mins after our original reservation time), the food was less than subpar, drinks were awful (how do you mess up a Margarita?) and service was mediocre at absolute best. I gave them the benefit of the doubt considering it was a relatively busy Saturday night. 

We returned against my better judgement for Taco Tuesday this past Tuesday, and I'll give them this, they're nothing if not consistent (in the worst way). We ordered tacos at the bar, and watched the waitress put the tacos behind said bar and forget about them. We didn't know they were ours at the time. Fast forward an hour...yes, an hour, and we moved to an open table, but before that, we closed our drink tab. We got to the table & ordered more tacos considering we hadn't received our original order. We let the waitress know that we never received our tacos at the bar so she went to confirm, and the bartender (wish I could remember her name), claimed those tacos sitting behind the bar were ours, and she just never got them to us. REALLY?! That's your literal job. 

Come to find out, the waitress ended up charging the uneaten, undelivered tacos to our card AND tipped herself. It took us 2 days of back and forth with the manager to get the charges reversed. 

Moral of the story, Hot Taco not only has poor service, drinks and tacos, but their employees, in particular, that bartender, have poor morals. Will not be back and urge others to take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hot Taco wasn't bad but it wasn't outstanding either. I would say it's a pretty typical Mexican style restaurant. What I did enjoy was the atmosphere. The restaurant itself was huge and a lot of fun. They had great decorations and the way it is set up is pretty efficient. It's like a big open room but there's a dining area and then the bar area and the bar is separated by some booths. 

The food was average. I got tacos in lettuce wrap and so did my boyfriend. They were pretty spicy which I didn't expect because t did say that. And we also got a free appetizer from checking in on Yelp which was awesome! We got the queso dip which was actually pretty good. I couldn't get enough of that! 

The margaritas were stroooooong! Definitely recommend those if you like tequila. Overall not a bad experience and I'll probably be back at some point to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is probably the only night to come here. However, expect to wait a long time for a table. All tacos are only $2 and there are plenty of drink specials. Also, if you check-in via Yelp, you'll likely get a free appetizer or something. The food though isn't anything special. While cheap on Tuesday, I don't find myself ever craving to go here."}
{"text":"Before I start my review, I was ANTICIPATING a great Tex-Mex Meal.  Meh!

We were immediately seated by the hostess, and were served warm chips and salsa.  The service staff IS ON-POINT. The servers and staff were very attentive to our needs and made the entire experience pleasant.

The Food... Another Story...
As a baseline, I ALWAYS order the Beef Fajitas to gauge a restaurant.  The food arrived in a timely manner and was steaming.  The rice seemed a tad al dente.  The refried beans were excellent and had great flavor.  The beef fajitas, although, had a nice sear, seemed lackluster.  I wanted more flavor from them.

The Venue... GREAT SPACE
I liked the way the rows of booths created an open space for the BAR area."}
{"text":"We came on Saturday for lunch. It was our first time here. We got a carafe of mimosa for $6, which was yum. The tacos were tasty and the service was great. We would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"I wish I could give you more stars Hot Taco, but alas... three is all I can do.  I've been here a number of times hoping my last experience would be no be a repeat performance, but it feels like something is missing.

This last visit, we came on a Monday evening... 6pm... so fairly early.  We were seated right away.  From the looks of it, the restaurant was only about 25% full with a small group of people doing happy-hour on the patio outside.

Our server was super attentive and got our orders in... this is where my visits usually fall apart... but the food actually arrived in a decent amount of time!  Someone other than our server came by to check on how our appetizer was and then our server came back to see if we needed refills and how our food came out.  Things were looking up for this visit... until the rest of the dinner crowd came in.  We were done eating and drinking and there was a good period of time before we were given any attention.  No fault to our server, I could see her working hard and attending to a lot of other tables... but maybe her section was too big?  Were they shorthanded?  Mind you when we finally got our checks and closed out the restaurant was maaaaabbbbbyyyeee 60% full... I could see why people that visit on weekends got so frustrated with the service.

Not sure what the solution is - but it seems to be a lingering problem.  I can understand if this place was brand spanking new, but this guy has been around the block for a while now.... I would expect it to be a well greased, tex/mex slinging machine by now."}
{"text":"Ok.  The tacos came to the table  with cold meat. Isn't the restaurant called Hot Taco?  Seem to have temperature issue with all sides and  other food except with my husband steak fajitas.  That came out super hot.  Waiter was good and attentive. 

Atmosphere seems more bar like in evening and parking is hard to find. They have parking lot attendant charging too on weekend when we came."}
{"text":"The tacos are decent but the guac is no good. Menu pricing is reasonable but in a city filled with Mexican and Tex mex this place is no where close to as good as other places. 

The place is well decorated and has a great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"During my very short stay in Charlotte, I found this place around the corner where I was staying. Ordered the Taco Loco salad for take out and it was delicious. Being vegetarian, I asked them to hold the chicken and to add diced tomatoes and roasted corn which they did! Their chipotle ranch dressing was very good. And their salsa and chips were good too. Overall very yummmy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sat night before a concert. Just sat at the bar for some margaritas. They were delicious. The food looked pretty good from afar. Someone got nachos that looked like it took up a whole table! I see the reviews for the food aren't the best but I would def like to be back to try it as Mexican is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Been to hot taco multiple times and it's awesome especially $2 taco Tuesday and you can get tacos in lettuce wraps! It's great!"}
{"text":"Location- Great! Tequila- Great! Taco Tuesday Deal- Great! Food- Ok. 

I would go here for the convenience, desirable location, and value. I will update this review after I go a second time as maybe the night I went was just an off night but I did not enjoy the fajitas that I ordered. Everything else lines up for a great evening in southend and maybe that is what it should be utilized for, location, location, location.  I'm giving it a 3 because of all the other factors that play into this review and my overall experience."}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday night and the place was super busy which I expected. This night, it just so happened that our food sucked. We had al pastor and carnitas which tasted totally bland. In the past, we never experienced this, so we expect more from Hot Taco. Please get this fixed as I will give you one more try. At least the service was great, thanks Jasmyne"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were great. Very friendly waitress and nice drink selection but took 45 minutes to receive the meal!"}
{"text":"It was taco Tuesday so $2 tacos and $2 margaritas. what more can I girl ask for you.  You know I live for a good margarita.  These were just ok.  I would need about 3 to get a buzz (don't judge me) lol.  Anyway tacos came out fast. lots of options for a taco Tuesday, fish, beef, chicken, pork and veggie.  most places just offer beef or chicken.  no side witj the taco but you get chips and dip at the table so you can get full for $8....I did. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times and I've never been pleased with my food.  The decor is nice but thats about it.  Last time i ordered shrimp it came out so fishy we had to send it back.  The guac is good though."}
{"text":"We went to Hot Taco at the busy time on a Friday night. There was a little wait, but mostly because they seemed understaffed. The hostess was very shy.

The salsa was almost spicy. The cocktails are very very sweet, way too sweet for our liking, but if you like sweet drinks they would be good. My paloma (\"Ventura\") tasted more like pink lemonade.

The stuffed jalapeños were out of this world!!! They're stuffed with pork and cheese and have plenty of heat. Yom! The enchilada was crispy fried, also tasted good.

I got the poblano stuffed with veggies and cheese,  which wasn't bad, but the cheese wasn't fully melted, which was a disappointment. The kale gave it a different flavor in a good way.

Sad we didn't try the tacos or empanadas, but we'll probably be back. Overall it was what you'd expect: casual, slightly overpriced Mexican-American fare in a great location."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews before eating here. The service was horrible. I didn't get to taste the food because they took too long to make it and I had somewhere to go. They did take care of my tab though, however, I was really hungry and needed to eat!"}
{"text":"The inside decorations and set up as well as the patio is very nice. Fun vibe and would be a good spot to grab a happy hour drink.

The food was sub par. I ordered the taco sampler and was unimpressed. The steak was tough, the fish (not much meat), and the chicken and pork seemed dry. 

If you check in, you can get a free app! We went with the guac. I was disappointed as it didn't have much flavor. Most of the flavor came from the tomatoes. Despite the food just being ok, the salsa was great! Big fan of a restaurant that gives complimentary chips and salsa.

Service was slow for it not being very busy. Our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I came here when Hot Taco first opening in the spring of 2016 and was not impressed. A year later, I'm delighted that they've figured a few things out. The service was slow, but the manager acknowledged it and comped our meal. The server was clearly overwhelmed since they were understaffed, but she was still as attentive as she could be. The food was great and good portion sizes. I did find it odd that the chicken in my chicken fajita appeared to be grilled then chopped up into some sautéed vegetables, but was delicious nonetheless. I'm glad this place has worked out some kinks and I hope it continues to improve and remain a staple in South End. Now I can't wait for warm weather so I can enjoy Taco Tuesday with a margarita and some tacos on the patio."}
{"text":"The hostess sat us down in the patio area. We literallty waited 10mins before we even had a server. When one of the servers came up to us, she was rude. Good thing she was not our server. The lady got our drinks in and our actual server came to our table. We placed our order, I got the ceviche and my friend ordered the chicken fajita. We also had Mango margaritas. The food and drinks were so good. I ordered dessert to go, I got the fried cheesecake which was horrible when I got home but maybe it's because I waited 2 full hours before deciding to eat it. The skin of the cheesecake was like the burrito skin. The cheesecake itself was good. Maybe the skin got soft and was not crunchy anymore. I would def come back again and give the dessert a second try."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. 

Came here on a Friday for dinner. As soon as we sat down, we got our drink order. After we got our drinks, we wanted to order a appetizer but our server didn't come by for a long time. The chips and salsa are good. Salsa has a good flavor and kick to it. When the server came, we finally ordered our appetizer but we were also ready to order food. As soon as I told her our appetizer, she walked away. So we had to wait another while before she came. We got the queso. It was ok. It was thick but  not spicy. 

I ordered the fajita rito and it was good but had more beans than meat. It came with chicken, steak, shrimp with rice and beans and lettuce. Came with queso sauce on top with a red sauce. Overall, it was good but lacked meat and there was some type of spice/herb that was in it that had a very strong mint taste. It was so potent that some parts were hard to eat. My husband got the combo and he liked it. Our friends also liked their food. 

One thing that was also strange was after my husband and his friend got a beer, they wanted to get another beer and when they were looking, the server finally told them the drink/beer specials. Would of been nice to know ahead of time. 

Overall, this place is ok. The best part is the chips and salsa. I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in this service. It was 3 pm which is standard day-drinking hours in Charlotte. I was with a group of 6 other people. We waited to even be acknowledged by a hostess for about 5-6 minutes. There were MULTIPLE empty tables inside as well. The hostess told us it would be ten minutes to wait to sit outside. We went to the bar to wait, where  the bartender told us she'd be with us soon. After about 10 minutes, she still never came to us, let alone anyone at our end of the bar. As we waited, the table outside let, but two girls walked up to it and sat. So our table was taken. The hostess never even said a word to us. We just left. Horrible business. Don't go"}
{"text":"So, I've heard nothing but bad reviews of Hot Taco. So naturally, I decided to check it out for myself for lunch yesterday. OK, OK - I held off until a \"Taco Tuesday\" so I could get some cheap tacos - how bad could they be? Even if it's Americanized \"On The Border\" quality, $6 for three tacos is a good deal.

I was pleasantly surprised. I had a Baja Fish Taco, a spicy shrimp taco, and their signature Muy Caliente taco. You can choose your tortilla style, or a lettuce wrap. I have to say that they all were great - not your typical Americanized Mexican fare. The Muy Caliente taco was by far supreme - a heap of roasted pork, cilantro, and queso fresco on corn tortillas (that was my choice of shell) - the pork was tender and full of flavor. Free housemade tortilla chips and tasty salsa were included, and if the default salsa isn't for you, there is a salsa bar with about 6 salsa styles and 30 or so different hot sauces.

And I didn't mention the $2 margaritas on Tuesdays yet, which weren't amazing, but certainly not bad. Yes it was a work day, but no, I cannot refuse a $2 margarita (or two).

I struck up a conversation with a couple of folks beside me at the bar and they were frequenters of the place, I'm guessing probably living in one of the nearby apartments. They said that the kitchen staff has gone through three changes since they opened, all for the better. They agreed that when Hot Taco opened, it sucked, but said that the restaurant has changed a lot since the first kitchen staff was there and the food quality has turned around completely.

This was my first experience there, but I have to say I was impressed given the negative tone of what I've heard about the place. So for anyone whose written this off as another non-authentic Tex-Mex place, give it another shot. You may be surprised. I plan on making this a regular Tuesday spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I sit at the bar. I came to this establishment on 6/13/17. I ordered some margaritas and was having a pleasant time. That was until one of the DRUNK employees sitting at the bar with a full uniform on started telling customers what they could or could not do or order. On top of that the barback would talk about customers behind their customers. This is my second visit here and this reassured me to never come back here. You're better off spending your money in any other good southend bar. Get rid of employees who drink at the bar while in uniform and Barbacks talking bad about customers. So unprofessional."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, menu was OK. Although we were told there was a new chef and new menu coming out. So will try again. Food was tasty. Beer menu so so - spoiled being in CLT and so many great choices."}
{"text":"I can not figure out why they only have 2.5 stars. This place is great! I think they have the best guacamole I have ever had. The pork tacos are also really good. Every time I have come in I have gotten great service. Please give them a chance. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"My friend and I only stopped in here because Futo Buta was closed and I didn't know it was closed on Mondays.

Our waitress, Chanel, was extremely sweet and fast, so she was tipped accordingly. However, the food itself wasn't good at ALL. I don't believe in taking money off a tip just because the food isn't good, as it's not the wait staff's fault.

My friend and I decided to split the sampler plate, which includes 5 of their specialty tacos. Decent at best but nothin that made either of us decide for sure that we wanted what was served. We also had the grilled corn, and this was the only thing decent. It still wasn't as seasoned as it should've been.

I ordered the two taco + 1/2 quesadilla meal. All bland. My friend didn't enjoy his taco salad either. He said that the chicken on his salad LOOKED seasoned but it wasn't.

Overall, I wouldn't be mad if someone said to me \"you can't ever go back to Hot Taco.\" Wouldn't fight or resist it in the slightest. 

I seriously wouldn't be surprised if they closed within the next year or so. The location is way too awesome for them to be there offering subpar food."}
{"text":"Holy packed Saturday, Batman!

I was craving queso, so I kidnapped my buddy Reido and headed to Hot Taco. It was super busy today and there was a little bit of a wait. No worries, we posted up at the bar. Our bartender was buried in the weeds between a full bar and tickets shooting out of the service well, but she handled as well as can be and with a smile on her face. Kudos to her, I would've been miserable. 

Though tempted by the mimosa special, I channeled my inner adult and stuck with a Coke. I got queso and the #9 combination. The queso comes in a little cast iron skillet that sits on a stand over a lit candle to keep it warm. My combo plate had two empanadas, two stuffed jalapenos, two tacos, rice and choice of beans for $12. There's a ton of protein and wrapper (including lettuce leaf) choices for the tacos. I did a blackened fish (you can also get it grilled or fried) with a flour tortilla and a beef with corn tortilla. I enjoyed both tacos, but the fish was my winner. The jalapenos were stuffed with chicken and cheese. I was full, but couldn't stop myself from eating them. Fish tacos and stuffed peppers will definitely be must get items for me when I come back here. 

Things to know: kids eat free on Mondays (with a purchase of an entree), $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and various drink specials every day. There's free parking with two different lot options. Hot Taco also has a nice patio area that's perfect for people watching in South End. Make sure to check in on your Yelp app, right now you can get a free appetizer!"}
{"text":"My first encounter with Hot Taco was at a Yelp event in South End, I was immediately hooked! After the event I've dined at Hot Taco several times, the atmosphere is great!  I love Tacos, specifically Chicken Taco's they have good flavor and nice crunch (I must say the taco's have never been as good as the first time). The super nachos, guac and corn are really tasty. 

I would recommend Hot Taco for a visit, the food is good, the atmosphere is great and the drinks hit the spot."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time frequenting hot taco. You're in South End for goodness sake, you can find somewhere else to eat and drink.

First of all, hot taco is amidst a few generic restaurants with reasonable food and drink, but for some reason it thinks its an upscale latino restaurant. The menu items and price point put it on par with a nicer uptown venue, but the food quality is really quite poor. I ordered \"nachos\" which were literally a pile of chips with sequestered clumps of sour cream, shredded lettuce, pico, and black beans dumped on top. Honestly, probably the worst nachos I've ever had. The only redeeming factor was the salsa bar (shout out to the avocado verde salsa, you deserve better).

Additionally, the drink menu is lacking a bit in the beer department. I ordered a Day of the Dead Amber - which was actually quite good - but was disappointed to have it served in a bottle with no glass. I did have a margarita, and I thought it was good quality for the value.

Beyond the subpar food experience, I was really blown away at how poorly run the service is. I couldn't even tell who our waitress was, as multiple servers came up to our table asking if we'd been helped yet. It seems like a free-for-all with the wait staff, and I recommend snagging whoever walks by if you need something. \"Our\" waitress took our drink and food order, and the nachos came out a good five minutes before our (wrong) drink order showed up. I could not believe how disorganized the entire service process was.

Don't bother. Go to Helles and Dunkel. Go to Babalu. Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"We came in on $2 Taco Tuesday night. We waited about 45 minutes for a table. The place was packed; we were lucky we got there when we did because the wait grew to 2 hours.

The tacos were good; they didn't blow me away, but I would come back.

Our server Haley was AMAZING! I have a gluten intolerance/allergy, and she was very attentive in making sure to let me know what was gluten free and what wasn't. When our food came out, she even came by and double checked the tacos that I had gotten the right ones the right way. I felt as if she went above and beyond especially on a VERY busy night."}
{"text":"Slow....it's a Mexican joint taco bell can do it thru a drive thru....shouldn't take  45 minutes"}
{"text":"Hostesses kept their conversation going & didn't look my direction until they were finished. She turned my way, not saying anything to me, but made sure I knew that I had clearly disturbed their conversation. I told her we had 3 people after she wouldn't speak to me. She passed the menus to the other girl & we went out to the patio. Waited forever for service, drinks, food and checks. Oh, but don't worry.. the service was everywhere talking amongst themselves. Ordered the chicken quesadillas. Still confused if I had salted jerky pork or chicken? The marg was horrific. Raspberry flavor... no, more like salted syrup. 

They have some SERIOUS work to do."}
{"text":"Gave a 1 star because 0 star isnt an option... picked up a to go order, ordered 1 shrimp taco and 1 fish taco.. no fish on the fish taco- only had cauliflower and carrots? Shrimp taco had 4 pieces of shrimp.. ordered black beans, got refried... total let down. Stick to Phat Burrito or look up Picante. They are in a location that will flop quickly if they dont get their stuff together!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and wait staff, but food was really bland.  Put some flavor in them tacos!"}
{"text":"I visited on Taco Tuesday, although I came late, lauren got my drink order and brought me in sync with the rest of the group. So that's nice

The drinks were definitely worth the price (especially the margs on Tuesday) service was fast, friendly and although I can't comment of the food. For drinks it's definitely a spot to check out"}
{"text":"I came to eat here during their \"soft opening\"/trial run.  My bf was a partnering designer from Interiors at Southend.  We were asked to join in on their practice run.

The space was cool and hip...very tastefully done.

The waitstaff was on their game and didnt miss a beat with refills on chips, drinks, or salsa while we waited for the food.

The food was delicious!  The portions were mighty and the temeratures were right on.   The rice was a little spicy hot ...and I'm sure they will adjust that in the future.  I love spicy....but people who shy away from spice may find it a little tough to take.
 
The queso dip was really really great...it was like \"designer\" queso...not the typical run of the mill white stuff you get at the order by number places.

All in all, my experience was spot on and i enjoyed my time at Hot Taco.  I will definitely be back after they get going on Monday.  

Good Luck Hot Taco!  You look great!

PS...see the many.pictures that I posted of the decor and the food entrees"}
{"text":"Not very well managed . Waited for hostess they never came and checked to seat people waiting . Had to go to bar got tired of waiting at hostess stand. Saw probably three other groups leave. Place is not busy at all."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the area,it is surrounded by other fun places BUT that's where the good ends. I have been here a few times and I will not be returning.  The staff is not welcoming they all seem preoccupied or they act like they don't see you. Once they finally seat you it's a while before you see your waiter for drinks or anything else you need. My husband and I was there on 4/28/18 we sat in the middle where you can see everything we noticed our food was up the place was not busy at all at this point our waitress was talking with other co workers at the front our food sat in the window for over 15 mins as we just sat there needing more beer/anything to drink ,we have given this place multiple chances but everytime it's been disappointing. I wouldn't have given it a star but it wouldn't let me post if I didnt."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! My husband and I ate at Hot Taco on a Friday night and took advantage of the $3 Corona/Lt. special. Our server was very thoughtful. As soon as we sat down and gave her our drink orders, she informed us that she had a large party getting ready to order. We were able to order our food at the same time as our drinks, avoiding a potentially long wait.

The queso and salsa were delicious. My husband got the Fajita-rrito, which was okay - the steak was tough. I had three tacos: baja fish (blackened), orange shrimp, and el pollo. The blackened baja fish and orange shrimp were really good. The chicken was a bit bland, but nothing a little salsa & queso didn't fix. The tacos were paired with a generous amount of rice and beans, which is always appreciated. Overall we had great experience and we'll be back.

----

This is an updated review from 11/2016 and I'm so bummed to update... this used to be our go-to taco joint in Charlotte. The orange shrimp and Korean beef were two of our favorites! Tonight we went to have our usual and found out that they changed their menu. Both tacos were omitted, and you can no longer mix and match tacos with the meal. Our server, Lauren, was great and informed me that you can order your tacos a la carte with one side and the cost is roughly the same (however only includes one side instead of two). 
After we received our food we have to say the quality of food is very different from what we used to love about this spot. The tacos had very little meat. The fish lacked flavor and the ground beef was extremely salty. I communicated my unhappiness with Lauren and spoke with a manager, who ended up comping my food. I was very appreciative of the kind gesture but also disappointed in our experience. We were told a phase two of the menu will be available soon... until then I don't think we'll be back. Again service was awesome but the food is not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, flavorful salsa, and plenty of food options! 

In combination with the wonderful service, Hot Taco is a great place to go for lunch with coworkers, game nights, or for a simple date night idea with the spouse! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my fish taco feinds!"}
{"text":"Just moved to south end and was pleasantly surprised this was walking distance from my new home.  Margaritas aren't too bad - had to send them back to get them fixed though.  Food is good. And I can sit outside with my puppy which is a plus."}
{"text":"Delicious. We went to their Taco Tuesday, where all their tacos were $2 and their margaritas were $2......or if you have had a hard day you can get a large margarita for $4.50. If you do try the tacos, try the Fried Baja Fish, Orange Shrimp, Carne Asada, and the El Pollo."}
{"text":"Hot Taco's food was decent. Good amount of food and quality was good. Wait staff was a bit slow even though it wasn't particularly busy. Water not refilled and the people I was with had to wait quite a while to order another beer. Drink prices are reasonable with specials."}
{"text":"My friends and I went in last night for Taco Tuesday, the food and service was great! You can't beat $2 tacos and $2 mini margaritas! Maria was our waitress and she was very attentive to our needs and her taco suggestions were on point, will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and give Hot Taco an overall 2.5 stars

Food was 2 stars, and service was 2 stars....

..however the drink specials, location, parking/train options, people watching and atmosphere of others dining there made it a solid 3 stars.

I ordered the basic fish tacos and they came out cold and the fish was tough to chew.  Hubs tacos came out the same way.  womp womp.  Our service was decent...friendly but she wore sunglasses and looked and sounded tired.  (we sat outside hence the sunglasses)  Thought that was odd.  
The quac was bland, tacos were cold and bland so I was slightly disappointed.  Luckily there is a free appetizer with check in so we didn't have to pay for the quac.  

Overall if you're going here to experience the food....meh.  If you're wanting to just relax outside with one of their drink specials and nibbling on an app...fine...I'd come here again for that."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was pretty disappointing! 

I came in around 2 today with some friends, so it wasn't busy at all. I think, besides some people at the bar, we were the only people seated. With a check-in, you may get a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree which is very generous. That was the best part of the meal today. Because there was 3 of us, we got 3 different appetizers. I really recommend the corn! The portion size for the empanadas is quite generous, but it just reminded us of pizza rolls. Overall, appetizers were good. The water there tastes a little funky, I would get a soft drink. 

For entrees, we all got tacos and quesadillas. They have this combination of 2 tacos and a beverage (between 11-3) for only $8! I thought it was a great deal; however, the food was such a disappointment. I ordered a steak and deep fried fish taco. The steak was burnt for me and my friend so it was brought back to the kitchen. The taco itself wasn't really good, it lacked a lot of flavor. I didn't even get a deep fried fish taco, it was just seasoned so they went back and got me another one again. The rice and beans that come with it are ok, nothing special. 

We then decided to give dessert a try. We got the tres Leches cake which was good but very dense. We also got the churros. The churros are good without the chocolate dipping sauce. The sauce tasted kind of burnt. 

Comments on service: Our server was very nice, however she seemed new to everything. We had to repeat ourselves many times when ordering. She just didn't seem very alert or there. Someone from the kitchen came out and apologized about our food which was nice. I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon. It's worth a try though, so don't let the review hinder you from going."}
{"text":"Fantastic outside seating and great food. Took the pup and sat outside and they had water available for dogs which was just a great bonus. The food is also phenomenal. I would recommend the taco sampler plate on the starters menu for first timers. Just be prepared to go and relax and maybe even order 2 drinks at a time because the service is super slow. If you're looking for a great place to people watch and enjoy yourselves with the expectations of being there a while it's the right place for you. We will be back to enjoy the atmosphere and the house margaritas!"}
{"text":"Cool place to eat. Not much of a Mexican Food eater, however the shrimp taco was really good"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. I should've checked Yelp to save myself the time and money. Hot taco was less than average. I ordered the al pastor taco and the baha taco. The alpastor was decent. The Baha taco was terrible. The fish was BLAND. NO Flavor at all. The dish came with a side of beans and rice. The rice was bad. The black beans had no flavor. 

I ordered a drink. It was decent, but being the most expensive item on my ticket, it wasn't worth it. I also didn't like that the glass it came in wasn't clear. Think about it, aside from the mugs of a Moscow Mule, you can see your drink. And most of it was ice. 

The Mexican street corn was decent. Overpriced at $7 for two ears of corn. I won't be returning. My friends gave more favorable ratings, but \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is right on the money."}
{"text":"I visited on their second night of opening. Service was great, although it took an hour for our food to get to the table, when the restaurant was not very busy. The manager came to our table and sincerely apologized and comped our meals. I will definitely be giving Hot Taco a second chance, great atmosphere and another future hot spot in South End!"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends here on a Friday night. The restaurant was very empty, which never sends a good message.  We were seated immediately and our server, Carolina was prompt in taking our drink order.  20 minutes in, a slacker friend changed their mind and decided to join us.  We had a second table pushed up to  our table literally .2 seconds after asking without being treated like it was a HUGE deal to be done.   
The server checked to see if we had any questions about the menu. The food was out quickly and it was very yummy.  Between the 5 of us, we tried the Chimichanga (so good!), the pork tacos, the empanadas and an enchiladas.  We were all very full and very satisfied with our food.
Will definitely be back for the good food and excellent service that was provided."}
{"text":"Definitely not \"Hot\".  Went on a Friday night with a group of friends.  The service was slow, extremely slow.  When we were handed our entrees, they handed everyone the wrong plates.  Food was less than mediocre. The veggie quesadilla, barely had any veggies in it.  The food had some heat to it, but hardly any flavor. There are so may other places in Charlotte that have the mexican/ tex mex down, sadly hot taco does not. Anywhere, but here."}
{"text":"super fun atmosphere and nice staff! food is so good and filling! i really love how finding a parking spot isn't much trouble and that it's free right across the street ;) will definitely return for all my future mexican food cravings ;)"}
{"text":"First time at this new restaurant, although during football season I spend quite a bit of time next door (at All-American Pub). I absolutely love a place that picks a theme and sticks to it! That said, there's no mistaking the Mexican fiesta happening here. 

Seven of us arrived Saturday in the midst of lunch but the place was nowhere near capacity. We were seated pretty quickly and given water, chips and salsa right away. (A must at a Mexican joint, right?) 

After ordering drinks, our server was pretty slow about returning to get our food order. An understandable offense if the location is very busy but given I don't believe Hot Taco was even half full, this group of hungry girls got a little anxious.

The food is typical Mexican fare - nothing spectacular. We were tickled and impressed that they warm the queso in a mini skillet over a burner when they bring it to your table. Genius!

Oh - don't try to mix and match tacos - they're not having it."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the tacos. I got steak, chicken, and fish and the meat wasn't seasoned at all. Decent but I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Great Margheritas!!! I stopped in for a drink and was happy I did. The drinks were excellent. I can't wait to go back and try the tacos. The decor was a little over the top. I am not a Sangria expert so I'll reserve my comments on that. I wasn't impressed but again, I'm no expert."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while driving through South End. Such a fun atmosphere and we loved our waiter Megan!! She took great care of us. I ordered a frozen margarita that ended up being too strong for my taste, and she happily made another one on the rocks that was just right. Great tacos, especially the Baja. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Last time I came here it was good. Was also the first time. We sat outside and the weather was really nice. Today, horrible experience. First, saw that they had a Burrito of the Day. Asked the server what it was and she said \"Chicken burrito with black beans, etc....\" And that it was a large portion on a bed of rice. A different waitress came to take our order because ours was getting her face painted for Day of the Dead. She told me a completely different burrito of the day. She did say that they would make it the same meat, though, if I wanted. I went ahead and ordered it and when it arrived, it was barely a lunch portion. And the rice was inside, not beneath. The manager (?) came by after the meal and asked if everything was okay, and I said no, and she said \"Ok\" and KEPT WALKING. Also, the Margaritas are pretty much flavored water. Won't be back. I left hungry because I wasn't about to buy a second meal to make up for what the first one lacked."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last 6 months and every time I've been it's been pretty good. I know some people have issues here in the past but overall I've had good service and food every time."}
{"text":"Soooooo...as I've mentioned in previous reviews, I love Mexican food. I had been talking about this place for over a month and my boyfriend surprised me by bringing me here on a date. We both left agreeing that we will never come back again. 

We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly. She brought chips and salsa and our waters. When it came time to order, I was disappointed that there was no a la carte options. None of the dinner combinations had what I wanted but I was told that I could not add a single empanda, even for a cost. I was disappointed but willing to keep an open mind. 

We ordered mimosas and I would tell you about them, but they never came. The manager and waitress apologized several times. We said it was cool as long as we weren't charged for them.

Now to the food. The chips and salsa were actually really good. Our meals arrived and I had ordered the #12- half quesadilla, enchilada and taco. My boyfriend had the #11- two empanadas, two stuffed jalapeños, and two tacos. We both were not impressed. The beef on my taco was room temperature. The enchilada had been laid on top of the beans so it was soggy. The quesadilla was something I could easily make at home. My boyfriend liked the stuffed jalapeños. He said his tacos were just okay and the dough of the empanada was not good. It tasted kinda like a funnel cake and was very greasy. Also, he ordered a pork taco and there were huge chunks of fat. In fact, we thought maybe it was a piece of shrimp but no - pure fat. I also thought the rice and beans were bland and left 95% of them on the plate. 

I wanted to love this place. The location is great (although parking can be rough) and I had high hopes. But it was terrible. In fact, I would be surprised if this place stays in business. I don't mean that to be hateful but it is my honest opinion. Based on my experience and the other reviews, this place seems to be consistently bad. 

If you are reading this and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go to Maverick Rock Taco or Three Amigos instead (see my other reviews). 

Bottom line: underwhelmed in every way."}
{"text":"I have been there 2 other time and it's been great. This time food was not good at all. Frozen strawberry margarita was watery and at first served with salt even though we ask for sugar. When we sent the drinks back they just poured the drinks into a new sugar rimmed glass and brought it back to the table without making a fresh one. Food very bland, as a matter of fact it was so bad right after we got our food it was so bland and tasteless we called the manager over and as them to comp he meal. We left very disappointed.  I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Wandered in on opening night, and glad we happened on this place.  Tasty food, great service (Kylie, Olivia, and bus staff), and portions were perfect.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i'm a big fan of taco tuesday and this is my favorite spot to celebrate it, you can't go wrong with $2 beers $2 margs and $2 tacos. 10/10!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. we were told an hour wait with 20 open tables. Spoke with the manager who had nothing but excuses. Once I voiced my side I was kicked out  by security. Its not my problem that they were understaffed. Don't tell me an hour wait with 20 open tables. HORRIBLE execution. I've been a manager on the hospitality industry for 20 years. Get with the program!!!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out Hot Taco with a friend who lives in Charlotte. Our server was new, but she was friendly, helpful, and knew the menu well. My group got the taco sampler appetizer to share and I ordered a carnitas taco and a chicken quesadilla and a mimosa. The tacos were big and pretty good, but nothing special. My order ended up being wrong and they gave me a chicken taco instead of carnitas. The mimosa was really good, 10/10 recommend getting one if you stop by. My friend orders a burrito and it was huge. Like the biggest burrito I've seen in my life. You definitely get what you pay for here. If you're hungry and you've got a big group, this is a good place to go. It's trendy and has a cute atmosphere, and the food is all around pretty good. 7/ 10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Went on a $2 Taco Tuesday. So at least I didn't spend too much on the meal because it was not good. 

I got one asada taco and one blackened fish. All I can say about the asada taco is TASTE.LESS. It takes a certain level of skill to somehow suck the flavor out of otherwise flavorful things. As for the blackened fish taco...this one had more taste, unfortunately is was of a metallic variety. Not sure if that taste was coming from the fish or the cabbage but it was mighty strong. On a positive note the tacos are of a generous size and the waitress, while not very attentive, was really very friendly.

Not sure I will give it another shot, perhaps on another Tuesday. Also the name of this place is pretty dang gross. If you ever want to find this place even remotely appetizing do yourself a favor and DON'T look up 'Hot Taco' on Urban Dictionary...."}
{"text":"Came here at 10, kitchen apparently closes at 11. But closed early tonight. Not one person told us that the kitchen was closing. While every table around us got food. Manager straight lied and said he touched every table to inform them, we must have missed that...."}
{"text":"Where do I start?i... hostess seemed angry to have to walk 10 yards to our booth. If she spoke it was in grunts that were inaudible. Food is decent but not worth the extreme slow service. I don't get it, they spent a ton building this place and the decor is great but its reputation is mediocre on a good day. I keep coming here thinking it will improve... time to give up"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were the best part.  Ordered the #7 combo that had two tacos and an enchilada.  Both tacos were loaded with slaw and pico de gallo with hardly any chicken or steak.  Meat was pretty bland.  The chicken enchilada was good.  

This place has great decor, great tequila selection, and good service... But if your name is Hot Taco, you gotta have great tacos!!  Gave it three stars for this visit since service, enchilada, and chips/salsa was good.  Will try again in a few months"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here. We came on a Wednesday and it was half off fajitas!! What a great deal! We also tried the chicken quesadillas as the appetizer and they were also good. There is a good amount of tvs with a variety of things on. You'll always be able to watch the game you want. 

It's really in a good location. It's surrounded by other night life locations so this place gets pretty poppin on the weekends. It's definitely a good place to hang with friends or as a pit stop for a night out on the town."}
{"text":"I didn't have any issues with the service, since my boyfriend and I came at around 8:45/9pm. Our waitress was attentive and got our food out in reasonable time, but came by three minutes after taking our order to ask if she took our order already and double check what we asked for, so I could see how the service could be bad when the place is crowded. Other than that, we didn't experience any issues with service! 

The food was good! The Korean BBQ taco didn't taste like it was marinated in anything remotely similar to Korean BBQ sauce but it still had the smoky kick that I look for in BBQ. The ahi tuna taco was good, charred on the outside and raw and soft in the middle. The rice and retried beans were also good, the refried beans being better than most that I've had at my usual Mexican places. 

Overall, I'd recommend anyone to give Hot Taco a late night visit. I enjoyed sitting outside and people watching while I ate my tacos, and would come again! This is a prime people watching area, since there are a hefty string of cool restaurants in the area and it's always bustling!"}
{"text":"While the food and drinks are average at hot taco it's all a gamble about what type of service you will receive with it. When we arrived at hot taco there was a wait, so we went to the bar. The bartender was extremely nice and attentive, we got some drinks and she was nice enough to bring us chips and salsa. When our table was ready we asked to be moved to a booth (I had two large men in our party, the table was a bit too small), the hostess rolled her eyes, sighed and said I can clean one off when I get to it. So after watching her clean our table, I had to ask if it was ready. We sat at our booth for 20 minutes without an acknowledgment, literally nothing so much as a hello. One of the people in my party let an employee know we hadn't been served and she said, let me check on it. After another 10 minutes without service we decided to leave. On the way out, we let a few servers know about our situation, they could care less about he poor service, like the rest of the staff. It doesn't matter how average the food is, if the employees don't care for our service then they don't deserve mine."}
{"text":"Food is gross, service is terrible, drinks are full of sugar...and there was a cockroach running around the bathroom"}
{"text":"If your looking for authenticity then this is not really the place to go too. But the food isn't bad neither. I ordered pick up tonight which is the first time in a while. 

I've had not so pleasant experiences before. Between giving me the wrong order or forgetting the chicken to my salad or even the dressing. Sometimes my salad is stuck into a cardboard box. You definitely get better service just dining in. 

I always get their Taco Loco salad paired with the cilantro vinaigrette! It's light and tangy just the right balance for a refreshing salad. I've tried other menu items before and not so bad at all! Very pleased with my salad tonight 
  
They seem to be doing better"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed, not even a little bit! This place is super overpriced and the service sucks! $9 for guacamole that is basically just mashed avocados-so bland! Then waitress is oblivious to daily special so when check came, everything was full price...then she gets an attitude when asked to correct it...never returning!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The guacamole is delicious. The stuffed jalapeño peppers are a must try! Service is great. Many tequila options."}
{"text":"I really really want to like Hot Taco. Charlotte really needs a good Mexican restaurant. On the plus side I love their chips and the salsa is pretty good. I also liked the Margarita. It was a simple Margarita but not too sweet or sour. Unfortunately the rest of the meal was disappointing. The verde sauce is way too sour and the ingredients in the Chimichanga were bland. My hope is that it is a new restaurant and they will improve over time."}
{"text":"Well, I couldn't really try this place because I was carrying my Puertorican ID.
And this place is definitely an All-American Pub. 
I've been living in Charlotte for a year now and I lost my NC license for legal reasons. I wish they started recognizing Puerto Rico as a US territory. 

Anyways, the place looked really nice, was excited to try it."}
{"text":"Went fir early dinner around 430. Took advantage of the $2 taco/margaritas, cerveza Tuesday special. First off, the complimentary chips are served warm and are excellent! I ordered the baja fish taco and the side ordered the asada taco. Both tasted great but the meat in both of them was lukewarm, and it didn't Ysidro long for our food to arrive. Margaritas were excellent. As far as the length of time to be waited on, it was a little slow, and they were not busy."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and our server (Destiny) was on point. Some of the best service that I've had!"}
{"text":"Hot Taco is a hit or miss when it comes to good service. I've been here on several occasions and if it wasn't for the people I was with each time it wouldn't have been my first choice after my first experience. The location and deco are great and the food is okay. It's a good taco Tuesday place if you get on the waiting list early as they have some good $2 tacos and $2 mini margaritas but just be prepared to wait. The best bet is to order as soon as your waiter gets to you because it may be awhile before they come back."}
{"text":"They recently changed the menu, you can't mix and match tacos anymore, you have to order 2 of the same. Service has consistently been bad here, i live right across the street so I have been here multiple times and have never had great service. The food is really just ok for the price, you can get way better tacos for the price elsewhere. I exclusively get takeout now because The service is frustrating, the only reason I still eat here is he convenience for me."}
{"text":"It would have been really helpful for us to read the reviews before eating at this restaurant.  We were very excited to go here as this is a newer fun place to eat in south end. We both had a different margarita from the menu. I took one sip and couldn't drink anymore it was so gross. I even overheard someone at the bar send his drink back. The salsa was great but we didn't get more than one single cup. I got a beef and chicken taco and a half of a chicken quesadilla. Everything was horrible besides the beef taco. The beef taco had some good spice to it. The white cream on top tasted like Clorox. Our waitress was even worse. She hardly checked on us and took about ten minutes to bring us one beer while the bar and restaurant was empty. At that point we decided to ask for our check since we didn't know if we'd see her again. The only time she cracked a smile was when she handed us our check and said bye. I wouldn't return to this place even if someone was giving me a free meal. It's sad that something so poor is in such an awesome location in south end."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. 

When I arrived with my group at Hot Taco, there was no line and several empty tables. A woman who I assumed was the manager (seeing as she was dressed nicely and not in a uniform) came to the host stand asking if she could help us. She told us she would go find the host. She didn't. Several employees passed us at this time - one said hello and that someone would be there shortly, but the rest kept walking by us. When we finally sat down, our drinks (margaritas and water) took 40 +minutes to arrive. The waitress kept continuously complaining to us that the bartender was being slow and complaining about him, which made us feel extremely uncomfortable. In her defense, she did bring us two rounds of chips and salsa before another waitress helped us out and brought us water. The margaritas ended up being very watered down, and I traded it in for a Chardonnay. Several members of the wait staff stopped by our table to apologize for the delay and kept telling us how busy they were, which was a nice gesture but there were several open tables, open spots at the bar and no wait - nothing that seemed outrageous for a Friday night in Charlotte.  It seemed like several other tables had similar issues, as we saw two different parties walk up to the bar to get their own drinks. The taco I ordered was okay and seemed a little cold, but the rice and beans were a good side. 

I give 2 stars because I wasn't charged for the margarita."}
{"text":"We visited on a Taco Tuesday, one of many for my group of friends. Food was alright but the service was definitely worth mentioning! Lauren was prompt and very personable and for sure the best server I have ever had at hot taco!"}
{"text":"The food is VERY average and not worth the price. The drink specials are great, but the service, the service is absolutely atrocious. I've been here 3 times and it always takes forever to get the food (which isn't the wait staffs fault) and to get the check (which is the wait staffs fault). Last time we went there, and it was the last time ever, it took our waitress 25 minutes to pick the check up off the table and return it. It became a running joke at our table of how long it would take her. To be fair, I can understand this type of wait when it's busy, but we noticed that the waitress only had 3 tables at the time. Trust the reviews on this place and go to another Mexican restaurant in south end."}
{"text":"Waitress ran out after we left and accused us of stealing her pink pen, but we didn't even have a pen in our bill in the first place (used my own) she was not friendly and we did not appreciate being yelled at over a pen we never saw. Food was just okay

Update: they tried to be friendly and say on yelp \"please email us and we will make it up to you\". I emailed them and they never responded. They act like they care about your reviews but they don't."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The staff was quick, polite, and fun. However, food was very bad. The tortillas were bland, thick, flour tortillas. The fillings were equally bad. To put it simply, I'd rather skip their $2 taco Tuesday, and pay full price for Chili's (and for the record, I do not think Chili's is good)."}
{"text":"I went for Taco Tuesday a few weeks ago. The queso was good; that was free compliments of my Yelp Check-in! I had three different tacos, I can't remember the first two that I ordered, they were pretty standard, but the veggie one was delicious! I would definitely recommend it. The biggest part that I thought was lacking was the margaritas. We opted for the $5 and they weren't strong. They were sweet but after two I barely felt anything. I tried a $2 margarita and it tasted different and stronger, so not sure what was going on there. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Server - Destiny ...  Great service ....  Awesome atmosphere...  Love being able to walk from uptown locations to great restaurants"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero I would. Kids chicken tenders dry as a bone. They didn't offer to take it off the check they offered to give us something else to go. Why would I take something to go?

Carne Asada overcooked. Korean beef tacos, brisket with barbecue sauce on it. Not real Korean beef tacos. Refried beans tasteless. 

Waitress forgot to bring our margaritas. Service was spotty. Will not be back."}
{"text":"My family and I go to Hot Taco almost every week for the past month and we LOVE the fajitas! We've branched out to try other items and we've never been disappointed. Bethany is usually our server and she's the sweetest--remembers our drink orders, isn't too hard to find but also not too \"hover-y\", and really treats us like guests instead of just customers. 

I figured since I go here so often I might as well write a rave review!"}
{"text":"Meh.

I was shocked to see the Greek Isles gone, but decided to try this place out anyway (after all, who doesn't love a taco?)

I had the chicken tacos and wow, they were very underwhelming.  There was a massive pile of raw cabbage on the taco, with a little bit of chicken on top of it, then the usual garnishes.  It was very dry and just bland.  The chicken didn't have much flavor at all.

The waitress warned me when she brought the salsa out that it was outrageously good and very addictive.  I thought the salsa tasted like crap, almost like store bought.

There are way better options around."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Here since 730 it's 931 and haven't gotten my food yet. Took about 40 mins to get our drinks. Understandable that it's busy but no check up from management or server. Never again"}
{"text":"Went on \"Taco Tuesday\"....didn't mind that we had to wait over an hour for a table it's understandable on a night when their doing $2 tacos.....service was ok....we were a party of 6, we were greeted by our server who was training that night....drink orders were taken water and chips were placed on the table and our drinks came out relatively quickly.....our food orders were taken. Our food came out and none of it was hot as a matter of fact it was barely warm. Although I chose to eat what was in front of me rather than send it back on such a busy night All of it was pretty bland. I can honestly say that I will probably not be returning for food at any times soon. I really hope that someone in the kitchen is making sure that the food is going out at the correct temperature . I would hate to find out that someone got sick because of this."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while we were out and about town. We sat outside and that was enjoyable. It was halloween day, and there were a lot of people walking down the boardwalk type area in Costumes. So, we had a great place to people watch. The food wasn't that great. Not terrible, but I've had a lot better. We also had a margarita which was probably average to below average.  I would stop back if I was in the area and wanted some mexican, but I wouldn't wouldn't make a special trip just to come here. They have a parking lot across the street so that is convenient."}
{"text":"Myself and 4 friends ate at hot taco on Sunday December 27th. So far 4 of us have come down with terrible food poisoning after all eating chicken dishes. Do not eat here unless you want to risk getting sick!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is what's up.

Ok I won't lie. I had avoided trying this place based on the reviews here and honestly.. I was very pleasantly surprised. Maybe it's because my standards were adjusted based on the $2 Taco Tuesday deals, but I will definitely be back. On a Tuesday. 

Went with a group of 8 girls. Arrived at 630 and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes. Server was attentive and friendly. They still validate the free app with check in on Taco Tuesdays as well - SCORE!! 

I got a mini margarita, two tacos and guac for $6.50 AFTER tax. I mean come on?! You can't beat that. All of the tacos are eligible for the deal and you can get corn, flour or lettuce for your tacos. 

I recommend the orange shrimp and seared tuna tacos! I was full after two tacos and an app, but with no app, you'll want to order three as your \"meal.\" 

When I say they were yummy, they weren't Cabo Fish Taco good. But they were excellent for the price!!"}
{"text":"The food here is good - when you can get it. I just left after sitting more than 10 minutes at the table with no one coming over to even ask us to hold on. No chips. No water. Nothing. When we told the hostess she just said okay and no one tried to make it right. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Skinny salad with chicken and enchilada beef all individual containers because management evidently does not know how to manage inventory.  Wife and I go here weekly and it's always something else to deal with.  Good bartenders but clueless management    No apologize just ran out of large containers."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Hot Taco after waiting in anticipation for it to be built. After all the waiting, I thought it was just okay. Margaritas were watered-down, chips were oily, but salsa was good and had a kick to it. My wife and I each had three different types of tacos with the flour tortillas. I thought they were just okay and a little bland but my wife immediately threw all her food up when we got home. She got food poisoning almost immediately which is too bad. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Was excited about going to Hot Taco because I had enjoyed the place that was there before and wanted to check it out. The parking was a hurdle because it was a Saturday night and with all the other clubs and bars nearby the parking was scarce. Had to walk a couple blocks to get there but that was a minor thing. Got to the restaurant and joined a birthday party there that was in progress. They had eaten and warned me service was slow and the food was only ok. As it is Mexican food I felt it would be fine for me to eat there because there's not much I don't like and it's relatively easy to make. Service was a little slow but maybe it was because of the party, which was 22 people strong. I ordered a combo because the pricing structure made it seem like the best option. Taco are $5 each and the combo I got not only included 2 tacos for $10 but also a half quesadilla for only a dollar more. The orders were taken and food came relatively quickly, which was nice. But, the food was only so so. The tacos were dry with no sort of sauce and the meat was seasoned very sweetly, which was different but tolerable. The quesadilla did not come with sour cream or salsa as most do and was also kind of dry. After the party, I tried to leave and was hassled by the doorman because I stopped in a little side area to say goodbye to a friend. They were upset I didn't go out the \"right door\". So, not a horrible experience but I probably will not be back, mostly just because there are better restaurants for Mexican food and also more entertaining Latin nights. Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"The drinks were bad, food was bad, service was OK.  I did like the chips! The fajitas had no seasoning.  The margaritas and sangria were both just terrible.  The cook dos come out and ask how spicy we like our food.  That was nice.  The decor of the place is really cool."}
{"text":"Please reference to paragraph c before reading the rest of the review.

a.) As my friend and I came in we were excited to see all of the funky decor. As an interior designer I thought it was a very trendy funky space so props to the designer. I did think the booths in the center just sitting elevated out in the open were odd... My thoughts are to add a wall and make the other side have a small lip with bar stools. It would make more space for customers since there seems to be a complaint about the wait and add privacy to the awkward booths. 

b.) The food... Eh it's just alright nothing to write home to mom and dad about. (Hot taco is also owned by whiskey warehouse, brazwells, slate, etc. if that says anything.) It's great deals on the food but I don't know about you but I would rather pay a little more and get better food and better service...  I was reading the reviews and did get a free appetizer! ( please note the waitress saw me on Yelp. So she had to of known I saw all of the reviews... It's hard not to when there are so many off them). As I continue on The waitress let us enjoy our appetizers for awhile and then I asked if she would take our order when she came back to the table. Her response was, \"can I get some chips for you guys before that?\". She comes back no chips I don't know what the heck happened seemed like an excuse to me not to take our order. 

c.) Well i really wasn't going to let any of this bother me until I saw the bartender and waitress pick out a bug in someone's Margarita before serving it to the poor customer. After I had already eaten and had two margaritas for myself!!

d.) Oh wait! I spoke too soon it was going from worse to absolutely terrible when the waitress came back from checking us out and NONE of the cards were mine. So it will have gone from terrible to horrific once my cards are compromised. I did all that I could to keep a smile on my face. The waitress didn't even seemed phased by this. 

e.) really wanted to like this place but I am sorry this first timer will never go back. My thoughts are close the place for a week... Train your staff or hire people who care. (Mainly fire the bartender and waitress) and reevaluate some of your menu."}
{"text":"Mediocre, over-priced food. Not authentic Mexican (maybe that's my fault for assuming so). Very limited draft beers, but if you want 37 flavors of tequila they've got you covered. The seared tuna tacos made me sick later that night. I wouldn't even give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. 

I don't say this much because I used to be a server and know that some things can be difficult in a restaurant. But from start to finish, there was not one positive experience. When we first got there, we waited 15 minutes for someone to seat us. Server after server came by the host/hostess stand and kept saying someone will be with you in a minute, until finally one server decided to finally seat us. 

We ordered drinks when sat down. It took 40 minutes for us to get our drinks. It was absurd. We kept asking the server where are drinks were and she kept saying the bartender was behind. We finally got our margaritas. They were the worst margaritas I have ever had. They were extremely watered down house mix with tequila. I guess they were running low on the mixer and added water to make it last longer. My margarita was basically a clear liquid and tasted awful. 

Our service was one of the worst I have ever had. She was apologetic about all the delays which I appreciated. But she kept asking if we needed anything. We asked for water three separate times. She forgot each time and kept came back asking if we need anything. We finally had to grab another waitress to let her know we needed water. She brought the waters to our table in seconds. Our sever never noticed we got waters. She acted like she didn't care. When we ordered off the menu she didn't seem to know what any item was. She had to look off our menu to write down what we ordered. 

The food was mediocre at best. It came out cold like it had been sitting out for a while. It took us about an hour to get our food. So we waited 40 minutes for drinks and an hour for our food. 

I will most definitely not visit this place ever again."}
{"text":"I visited Hot Taco on the Friday night before Valentine's Day.  At the host stand they were giving roses to women as they came in.  That was a nice touch.

We ordered some queso to start.  It came out in a small skillet and sat on top of a tea candle that did absolutely nothing.  I get the thought behind it but the cheese congealed faster than we could eat it.  Not cute.

I got the fish tacos.  I thought everything about them was pretty skimpy.  The pieces of fish were small and the toppings were virtually nonexistent.  The rice and the black beans were both pretty uninspired.

At the time, this place did offer a coupon for a free appetizer with a yelp check-in.

Our server was nice and took pretty good care of us.

I would probably try another place in the area before returning to Hot Taco."}
{"text":"I'm giving this spot a 1 because when I first came for Tuesday taco day my friend & I dined-in. the chicken was different to my friend and they had ran out of pork tacos so she had to settle for beef the chicken was mushy and she could tell something was off talked the manager and they let us know they switched chicken companies. I came by myself one night after work and it took them more than 5 mins to just seat myself then Another 5 for a waitress to acknowledge me when she did she even brought water that's how long I'd been there . I asked if I could get my tacos Togo be cause I'd waited so long and she took my order with no problem. So the next week I tried to call ahead and I was informed the kitchen closes at 11AM BUT THEY CLOSE AT 12 ! This is the most ridiculous things I've seen and heard. Like you close at 12 so the kitten should close when the restaurant closes I understand maybe closing a little late but an entire hour THATS RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!  So then when I asked if I came in order my tacos like last time could I get take out they said no. BUT IVE DONE IT BEFORE (I explained to the manager on the phone that I was willing to drive from Ballantyne from work just eat your food,he still said no unless I was charged full price instead of $2)and for that I will never eat here again."}
