{"text":"Ate here for the first time and wasn't a big fan. The pizza was blah, with too thick crust and large boring outer crust. The toppings were ok, but not high quality. Had high hopes but I'd prefer eating at Ginos or Pizza Nova."}
{"text":"good but not excellent pizza was there a few months ago and was happy but my last visit i got a slice that had been sitting for some time plus had far less toppings than last time and toppings done in a hurry and unevenly placed wait for a fresh one dont settle for older slice MY 3 STAR RATING IS ON PIZZA NO IDEA WHAT WINGS OR POTATO ARE LIKE GINOS IS BETTER AND SIMILAR PRICE PIZZA"}
{"text":"This is good pizza. If you consider the walk-in prices, this pizza is so good it just killed Chuck Norris. The cheese on my pie was a very tiny bit over done but other than that this stuff was really really good."}
{"text":"Delicious Delivery!! Especially love the garlic fingers, great portion size of cheesy garlicky \"pizza\", only $5.00 for a 10 inch. Wings are not the best I've ever had--but still great, and really good value as well. Whenever I order, they always get everything correct, even my crazy special requests. I'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"Was just passing by Oakville and was craving for pizza. Vili's pizza was amazing! It was not overload with oil and was very tasty (my favorite, deluxe pizza). Plus, the server gave me 1 1/2 slice! Awesome!"}
