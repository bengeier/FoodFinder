{"text":"I've been here several times.  I find the service is good.  The menu is definately loaded on the carbs.  The pricing is very good.  I ate here this week and had angel hair pasta with sauce, the sauce was lacking for the amount of pasta what was on the plate, but I'm sure they would have given more if i'd ask.  I'd like to see more dishes with fresh vegetables"}
{"text":"The BEST Italian in Lower Burrell!  I usually take out, but I've eaten in a few times as well.  Service is always good, everything is always prepared quickly.  I've never had a dish I didn't like, and that includes pizza, wings, pasta, salads, soup & sandwiches.  The prices are very reasonable, especially when you consider how much food you get!  They have the traditional fare you qould expect at an Italian restaurant, PLUS (and this to me - as a bit of an Italian food snob - is the mark of a truly great place) They have dishes of their own creation that you don't find anywhere else.  I can't say enough good about this place!"}
{"text":"Will always be one of my favorites! Some of my recommendations are the pescatore, white clam sauce, and penne primavera (ask to add chicken or shrimp = bomb!). They have to be one of the cleanest, most efficient, and reasonably priced places around. I was first a customer and then employee so I got to see both sides of everything and this place is no joke! The family is wonderful and Beni is great to work for. One of the funnest places I've worked!"}
{"text":"we have eaten here once. food was mediocre at best. with all the choices around here my $$will be better spent elsewhere. will not go back."}
{"text":"It's just out of style... the food is dated, decor is old, centerpiece fountain doesn't work, everything was served with an orange slice for \"garnish.\"

The sampler fried appetizer platter is very disappointing,  everything is frozen on it. All the dishes were bland, we dumped salt on the Alfredo and red pasta dishes.

I only come here when my parents make us meet for family dinners... other than that I wouldn't go myself. Definatly not Reccomended."}
{"text":"So good! Amazing food with decent prices. Authentic Italian food that is homemade is hard to come by, and this place hits it right on the nail. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal from here. Staff is always super friendly and meals are always ready on time n still piping hot from the oven. Never dined - in but every takeout order was excellent. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time recently for a celebration.  We were in a private room so I did not see the main restaurant and can't comment on the atmosphere.  From many of the reviews, people seem to love it.  I found it average at best.  

Upon arriving our drink order was taken promptly, but trying to get a second was nearly impossible. They had one waitress trying to handle about 30 of us.  Now taking that into consideration, she did a good job, but she definitely could've used some help.  

Appetizer platters were brought out, consisting of your average fried bar food.  Not bad, but nothing special.  

The portions are huge.  Almost too big. I ordered the shrimp fravadollo which was supposed to be \"made with hot spices\" according to the menu.  (And shouldn't that be \"fra diavolo\"?).  I want to know where the spice was.  If I order something spicy, it's because I want spicy.  Not even a hint of heat.  Kind of bland.  The pasta was cooked correctly, as were the nice sized shrimp, but it was too dry.  Needed more olive oil or something.  The French onion soup was just ok.  I took the leftovers home and fixed it up a bit.  Parmesan cheese sitting out in the little shaker jars....I'd like some fresh grated Parmesan from an Italian restaurant.  

That said, with the waitress working our group by herself, the food came out in a decent amount of time and was hot.  I don't know if being part of a large party was the reason it was so mediocre.  Maybe for a regular dinner visit it would be better, but there are too many good Italian places out there to choose from for me to consider going back to give this one another try."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is delicious! The portions are huge and the prices are great.  Calzones, carbonara, pizza, spaghetti and meatballs- it's all so good!"}
{"text":"CARB HEAVEN! Delicious pastas from real Italians!

Came for a luncheon which the restaurant especially opened for us. I could eat a pound of their free breadsticks which seem to be a pizza dough base with wonderful spice/oil/butter topping. 

Meatballs and pasta were delicious and savory - portions are large. Meals are served with hot crusty dinner rolls and butter! 
 
When they brought out the entrees they brought take out boxes with them -  that's how large the portions are - and as an encouragement to save room for home made tiramasu.

The only thing I didn't like was the decor - little dull but I would definitely come back AT THE LEAST to try some take out. 

I talked to the gents running the place - they have been open for the past three years and are in fact directly from Naples, Italy. 

Try them if your in this neck of the woods - especially if you are taking a break from carb counting ;)"}
{"text":"Bravo!  What a great dining experience!  Fantastic customer service.  Our server arrived right after we sat down.   The menu had so many options it was tough to choose. I was in the mood for pasta.. so I got the meat tortellini and my boyfriend got the pizza.  With my meal I was able to get a salad and that came right away!!   It wasn't a tiny side salad but decent size and everything was fresh.    I swear it must have been minutes after my salad arrived -  our food came!!  It was amazing fast!!!   My tortellini was bursting with flavor and plentiful - definitely another meal the next day.  The pizza .. well it was out of this worth.  It was good- quality pizza.  Are you ready for this.. when the rolls were served.. they were \"WARM\"  !!!!   it's the little things that make a typical dining experience an amazing one.   We had a great meal - top quality food and was I and out ..  I love it! I cant wait to return !!!  BRAVO !"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in the area for about a year and have finally just got to eat here. It is FANTASTIC! We ended up going 3 times in the past week.

I recently found out I need to go gluten free and was ecstatic to find out they offer gluten free penne. 

The portions are HUGE and everything comes out STEAMING HOT. The prices are extremely reasonable and beyond worth it."}
{"text":"Ate there for a family celebration. Decor has not changed since I had a wedding shower there 9 years ago! Food was okay, got the Italian Sausage casserole and was disappointed it was sausage, onions, peppers and mushrooms, guess I was expecting a bit of pasta, should have read the menu better! My kids got cheeseburgers off the kids menu and they were huge! Reasonably priced, but nothing I need to go out of my way to eat again."}
{"text":"This is the only Italian restaurant we go to around the area! The food is amazing, highly recommend to anyone. Our favorite is the chicken parm!"}
{"text":"It was just ok for us. Wife ordered chicken piccata and sent it back for lasagna. It wasn't that good either. I got the shell fish in linguine and it was really good. Good portions and casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places when I want Italian! Everyone is always so friendly and the food is consistently amazing. Large portions and good prices."}
{"text":"Eggplant was delicious!! Got meatballs on the side. They needed garlic & spices. Plenty of sauce to dip the fresh rolls in. 
Yummy! We will return!"}
{"text":"Words can not describe how great this place is. Food is awesome service is impeccable and the owner Benny is the best. My mother-in-law was going through chemo he would make her special dishes just to make sure she ate good. I would and do reccomend this place to anyone. Plus the canolis are the best must try."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and always HAPPY TO SERVE usThank you for being really NICE, especially when we show up last;) We work long hours at our local Aveda Hair Salon & We thank you for feeding us!"}
{"text":"Decent food. I ordered the Chicken Parm and the piece of Chicken was HUGE. For some reason, they have no Wedding Soup during the week. Odd for an Italian joint. Waitstaff was kind and friendly. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"We sat for 10 minutes before we finally asked if we had a waitress!  After that, the service was good but the food was only mediocre. I don't think we'll go back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  We ordered off of a limited menu, but I am assuming the items available were part of the regular menu.  I had the eggplant parm which was good...breaded and fried, then baked with sauce and cheese on it.  I thought it was strange that it did not come with a side of pasta.  

I sampled the chicken marsala which was OK, but they went a little overboard on the mushrooms.  There were also a few other items I sampled, a veal dish and an in-house dish that was called Mafia Pasta or something.  

Everything was good, nothing was great.  The service was not good, they forgot to bring out the appetizers and the waitress seemed annoyed with having to deal with a party of about 20, even though we were seated at separate tables, so it probably wasn't much different than simply having 4 or 5 tables to wait on."}
{"text":"The best pizza I had in years. Tons of flavor, and really good crust. The salad was really good too."}
{"text":"Everytime we go there we get good service,  the portions are great and the value is fantastic.   Go hungry!  

I had the meatball hoagie with a side,  food was hot and fresh.  Servers never let my drink empty."}
{"text":"We ate here for a family reception and the staff were so accommodating and the food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  We took over one of the side rooms and kept switching around seats and they never got flustered and managed to keep all of our food straight.  I had the chicken marsala and it was delicious and everyone around me was raving about their food.  We had about 25 people in our party and the bill came to just over $300 with tons of leftovers.  The locals all recommended it and I can see why!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a rehearsal dinner for my wedding on Friday night. The service was great and the food was delicious.  The portions were huge.  No one went home hungry. The chicken Romano was particularly great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Still the best Italian food in the A-K area!  Benni and his crew there are like family! All kinds of great Italian food. If you like seafood, my personal favorites are seafood pescatore and calamari marinara. They also have a great raspberry chicken! Hell...it is ALL delicious. Beni, his family and his staff are incredible! Go, eat, enjoy!"}
{"text":"We took my grandmother there along with our daughter.  \"Gram\" goes there occasionally and my SIL goes there as well, both had good things to say so there was a small expectation.  We were seated in the main dining room near the water fountain.  Its big but doesn't fell big, which is good.  Both gram and my wife got salads which they enjoyed very much.  The waitress made sure that their orders came out correct.  I had the steak & cheese hoagie which was very good.  It's a very good spot for a nice longer type of lunch.  We'll be back to checkout the dinner scene.  Oh and its an excellent spot for families.  My daughter was very happy with all the bread."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice.  The first time the food was mediocre and the salad had no taste. The lettuce was warm and wilted and the house dressing tasted like oily water. But it seems that the parking lot is always full and they are consistently rated a top restaurant in the area so we thought maybe we had just gone on a bad night and we'd give it a second chance. Take two, the salads were still tasteless but at least cold this time. They don't offer fresh Parmesan like most Italian restaurants either. My lasagna came it a bowl and was very burnt. The sauce was bitter and honestly it was barely edible. My husband's chicken parm sandwich was also not good. We aren't picky eaters either. I honestly don't understand some of the good reviews on this place. If you want great tasting Italian food go to Elena Restaurant in the Hillcrest Shopping Plaza. We go there a few times a month and never have a bad meal there."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the years, but I think no more.  Everything we had was loaded with salt, the pasta was overcooked, ... even the water tasted bad!  They try hard, but they seriously need a new chef."}
{"text":"Recently a group I belong to had a dinner here. I was not impressed. We had approximately 20-25 people. All participants in the dinner ordered their meals in advance per the restaurant instructions. The dinners were brought out in shifts, with stuffed shell orders coming out first, then the steak dinners and finally, my lonely angel hair pasta, the easiest meal to prepare. Our server, and we only had one for all those people, even made a joke about my meal. The food was decent but not exceptional. I asked for an Absolute/cranberry and was told they only have Grey Goose. No problem. What I got was Smirnoff, without asking me first because they were out of Grey Goose. While this place might be ok for a dinner for two or a family, I would never arrange a group event here if it was my choice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! The staff comes to know you by name and everyone is so nice. The food is great, and they give really big portions. I've never left without leftovers."}
{"text":"Love this Italian restaurant! It's right down the road from our place, the menu is huge, isn't expensive and they have great portions. Lot of parking in the back and the staff are always nice and welcoming. Decor is a little out dated but everything is out dated in the old country. I have relatives in Italy, so it def has an authentic feel too it. Love their pasta dishes and the home made rolls are awesome. My husband will go there just for the bread. If you are in the area, it is a great choice for eating in or take out."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food.  Chicken made with an amaretto sauce was delicious.  I love the water fountain in the middle of the restaurant and the pictures from Venice that decorate the place."}
{"text":"My wife and I regularly either dine in or use takeout dinner with Villa Ballanca. Recently, my brother, his family and friends and my wife and I dined and very impressed by the large selection of Italian dishes, quality of each entree and the very friendliest of servers and owners. Benny, who is head chef and is also the special cog in the restaurant's overall success, is a pleasant greeter either entering or departing the restaurant. It's a joy to dine there! In conclusion, you won't go home hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Old school Italian eatery  with great staff. We live about 90 minutes away and can only come once in a while. I had the chicken parm. It was huge and delicious. Every time we come here the food is great and the staff is very friendly. Love it."}
{"text":"Second visit today with my wife. We really enjoy this place. Last time we had ravioli and eggplant, with the fried zucchini appetizer. Was very good, and we brought home leftovers.  Today we got veggie pizza and the combo platter appetizer for lunch, again we had enough to have the rest for dinner at home.  We don't live that close, but when we are in area, this will be a top consideration for stopping to eat.  Would love more options for vegan/vegetarian eaters. We are vegan, we make due when we can and order the closest to our preferred eating choice.  This day and age, even for an old school, homemade Italian vibe that this fine restaurant has, more vegan choices would get 5/5 from me."}
{"text":"Th e best restaurant on the fucking planet I mean damn the first time I ate here I was blown away. I will always comeback here thats some good shit."}
{"text":"Excellent red sauce!  I have eaten here about 20 times.  I have never had a bad meal.  Benny and his staff are very friendly and accommodating.  Chicken parm with side of pasta is highly recommended.  Portions are huge!  Eggplant parm is also very good.  Spaghetti cooked ala dente and without extra water in bottom of your bowl.  You get homemade breadsticks after being seated and homemade rolls with your meal.  The house dressing is excellent.  I've driven 55 minutes to pick up a pizza from here, of course I ended up eating it in the car on my way back home.  There pizza is great, had the thin and the thick.  Our waitress has alway been attentive, personable, and service oriented.  Let's face it, this is the best place in that area to eat.  You got McDonalds, Burrell Inn, and Sheetz."}
