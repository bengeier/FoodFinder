{"text":"Had it yesterday. A pleasant surprise! Since Flying Fish closed down at the end of last year we needed a new F&C joint. Stopped in last night and had take-out. Huge halibut meal that served 2 for 15.99. Came with 2 fish and a massive amount of fries. Also a fresh salad big enough for 2.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here.  Its not a big place but certainly a good place to hang out and share a meal with friends.  The food was pretty decent and the service was good.  The place was clean.  I had the Halibut and Chips which came with coleslaw.  Very tasty, and prepared well.  Lets do it again some time.  There were a few other items on the menu i wanted to try, so another visit is in the near future."}
{"text":"I am very excited to be the first to review this place. Originally, we had planned to go to another place for lunch but that place was closed. I'm really glad that place was closed and we ended up here! Upon entering, we got seated immediately. Place was very clean. We ordered the Caesar Salad which was pretty good. We also ordered the poutines which were delicious! The fries were fried nicely and the cheese and sauce just meshed perfectly. We also ordered the fried scallops, fried cod and fried halibut. They were all pretty good, and fresh out of the fryer. Service was very friendly. Will definitely return when in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish n chips!  I live in Scarborough and cannot find a place like this anywhere here.  I ordered 2 halibut fish with chips for $12.99, yes folks I did say $12.99.  The fish was quite large and came with fries, a little coleslaw on the side and,  tarter sauce.  Fish was cooked just right and not greasy at all.  The owner(s) were very pleasant and asked how I liked the food!  They seem to care about their customers.  I highly recommend this place, in fact I will make the drive whenever I want quality food at an affordable price."}
