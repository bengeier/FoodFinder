{"text":"I have eaten at M&B in Vancouver about 100 times now and am shocked by the poor quality of the food at the Calgary spot
I have had porchetta 3 times now and all 3 times the meat was cold and very oily!
I've only been able to have the meatball sandwich once as they only have on Friday - found it very bland
The location is terrible with no parking easily accessible (I'm lucky enough to NOT work downtown!)
Was really looking forward to have M&B here but will wait until I go back to Van - actually easier to get to even though I have to fly to get there!"}
{"text":"The legendary Vancouver / Seattle sandwichery now in Calgary.  Tried the beef with horseradish and garlic. Amazing.  Prices reasonable and the staff are organized and efficient without compromising quality.  Will definitely be back for the flagship porchetta."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Some say they're on the small side, but I find them perfect with a side salad.

You can't go wrong with the porchetta, but the daily sandwich and salad are unique and always worth considering. Had a jicama salad once that I'd love to try again.

One thing I love about this location is the tasteful renovation. The tile is beautiful."}
{"text":"My favourite sandwich place from Vancouver is now in Calgary!
Best MEAT sandwiches you can get. 
Daily Roasted meats, awesome sides, and sauces to hit in outta the park."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I like the side sauces. I would like some bolder flavours. The service was good and quick."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time today and got the special, a thai chicken sandwich. After inhaling it in less time than it took them to make it, I considered for a rather long while whether or not to lick the inside of the box. Eat here... it's tasty, well priced and a refreshing addition to the downtown lunch scene."}
{"text":"$10 porchetta sandwich is underwhelming. Decently cooked pork is topped with more chewy than crunchy diced cracklings and a salsa verde that is high on oil, low on flavour. Soft Corbeaux baked buns are easy to bite through but lack the appealing texture and taste of a more well-developed bread dough. I'd happily pay $6 for this; $10 is just a little too dear. 

Potato salad continues the theme with a creamy dressing that lacked both acid and salt. Potatoes were just-undercooked, which isn't a bad thing if they are interesting potatoes in a light, German-style dressing; these were not. Pricing for proportion was decent at $4, if the salad itself was better. As it stands though, I wouldn't recommend it.

Counter service was quick, friendly and efficient. Space is lovely, with minimal seating but lots of apparent turnover. 

The snarky side of me wants to call the hype around this place typical Calgary 'little-brother'ism'; an unremarkable, over-priced product fawned over seemingly because it's an import from the 'big-city'. Decide for yourself."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for lunch here after hearing our friends' excitement that their fave sammie shop from Van was finally in town.

Thankfully we didn't let the long line up deter us, as it moved pretty quick. You have your choices from four sandwiches, the daily soup or the daily salad. No added bells and whistles, simple and efficient. Assembly line for the win!

We managed to snag a couple seats by the window and prepared ourselves to experience what would eventually be one of the best sandwiches we've had. I went with the Porchetta - pork topped with salsa verde and crackling. My GF got the Buffalo Chicken - shredded chicken tossed in hot sauce and topped with slaw and ranch dressing. Both had great flavors and textures! I wish mine had a tad more crackling to have a bit more crunch. And if you're going with the Buffalo Chicken, make sure to grab a couple extra napkins as it gets messy!

For about $10, you get fresh quality sandwiches, which I think can be hard to come by when you're downtown. Check them out, you may find your new fave lunch spot :)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place thanks to John Catucci's show that I happen to watch the evening before. Highly recommend food, atmosphere and the welcoming feel of the room. can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"[sigh] I'm getting tired of food businesses that think that a mid-century inspired design (which is really mainstream now) allowed them to charge very high prices for average food with no service.

This place is avery very very simple (4 items on the wall menu)"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sandwich.  I had the BBQ beef sandwich.  The sauce was delicious, the meat tender and juicy and the coleslaw was a nice crunchy addition.  Worth the $10 cost.  Friendly staff, quick service.  A plus is that the takeout container is cardboard so it's recyclable. I will definitely go back.  I want to try the chicken sandwich next!"}
{"text":"The menu consists of essentially seven items: four sandwiches, a soup, a salad, and a dessert. This is obviously a relatively low selection, so we were wondering if perhaps they rotate all four daily, but based on their website, it seems like three are fixtures with a rotating daily one. The soup and salad rotate daily. I am an indiscriminate eater, so this wasn't an issue for me, but admittedly if you're from out of town and just happen by, it may not end up being very appealing to you and your group. 
   I got an Alberta Beef, which was quite good. The meat was fresh and flavourful, definitely not cheap and obviously locally sourced. The arugala was fresh and crisp, and the pickled mushrooms and onions were a good compliment. In my opinion, I like my pickled stuff to be more potent, but it did allow for the meat to really come through as the dominant flavour, which is good; you don't want the most expensive component to be a secondary flavour. People will probably be split on the horseradish cream. It is not spicy in any fashion, which may then increase the appeal a bit, but it also lacks the same depth that horseradish proper has. I definitely noticed it and felt that it was a worthwhile inclusion, but it could have been argued that it was toned down too much.  

Service is extremely fast; the sandwich will beat you to the cash register half the time. They seem to get a lot of traffic at lunchtime, so it makes sense. Seating for groups over pairs can be tough depending on the time of day that you go at. There was no seating at 12:45 on a weekday, but it cleared out by 1:30. Prices are reasonable for downtown Calgary, but I do think it's a bit overpriced, probably with a markup for using fancier-grade ingredients. I would argue that I should have paid $8, not $10, for my sandwich.

Overall, this is a good place, but it's difficult to see how it can attract a significant and consistent customer place when their options are always going to be so limited. The food was good, but not mindblowingly great in a way that would make you want to come back and eat one of the three staples on a daily basis."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!

I've always wanted to go to the one in Vancouver but never got around to it so imagine my excitement when they opened up in Calgary!

I've only been there twice, and I've only had their porchetta sandwich and salads.  However, I like what I tasted.  I love that the porchetta sandwich has a combination of lean meat, fat, and cracklings.  The flavor profile of the meat is off the charts! The bread and the condiments makes it a pretty tasty sandwich.  Price point can be a tad lower but that will not deter me from returning.  Since I'm so in love with the porchetta sandwich I'm not sure if I will ever try anything else... 

Very friendly and efficient service too!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Meat and Bread was pretty disappointing. I had walked by the shop, and saw what looked like a delicious, juicy porchetta sitting in the window...its crispy skin glistening in the window. I couldn't wait to try it!

What I got instead was a major letdown. The Porchetta was gross and fatty. You can see from the photo how much fat I cut off the pork - and that wasn't all of it. The cracklings did not crack at all - they were soggy and flavourless. The only redeeming quality of this sandwich was the yummy, fluffy Ciabatta loaf - props to Corbeaux on that! 

Sorry Meat and Bread - I won't be back."}
{"text":"Was super excited to check them out on their opening day today! Tried their porchetta sandwich while my friend got their meatball sandwich which was the daily special for today along with gingerale for drinks. The prochetta sandwich included sliced pork, salsa verde and crackling on ciabatta bread. This was a really great combination as the soft pork was went great with the cracklingl. I was recommended to try the sambal sauce with the sandwich which was a house-made sauce that they sell as well. It was mildly spicy and went really well with the sandwich. Overall, we enjoyed our sandwiches today and would recommend it! I would visit it again to try out their other sandwiches but maybe not right away as I feel kind of guilty about not eating enough veggies haha"}
{"text":"The Porchetta sandwich was spectacular. A signature accomplishment for the human race. Can't stop thinking about it."}
{"text":"Every bit as perfect as Meat & Bread in Vancouver. I made it in on opening day and got that amazing porchetta- delicious meat, sauce, and that bread, which I understand they've contracted with the outstanding Corbeaux for its Calgary location(s) (that's a very hopeful \"s\"!) all every bit as good as what I had in Vancouver in February. I came back on Saturday (yes, this location is open in Saturdays unlike the on in the Vancouver financial district) and had the daily special which was a buffalo chicken and which was similarly delicious."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Bread was very tasty. Chicken was great too.  Sandwich was a bit messy, but I didn't mind.  Lean over your plate!  They have bottled sodas to choose from, bottled water, and tap water in a carafe to pour yourself.  Very friendly staff.  Four stars instead of five because they were out of the smoked brisket sandwich which would have been my first choice.  It was Stampede week, and they said they had been stampeded that day.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see that one of my favourite sandwich joints in Vancouver came over to Calgary! All their sandwiches are served on fresh ciabatta bread and they have approx. 3 different options to choose from (simple, right?!) as well as a daily soup and salad of the day. They claim that you can come here every single day for entire year and never have their daily sandwich special twice. If you are someone who usually sticks to the same dish when you go some where (I can definitely be one of those people), don't be too disappointed because their next day sammy will be equally as good. They serve their sandwiches in a to-go box (unlike the wooden platter in Vancouver), which is definitely a convenience downtown feature. Pretty decent amount of sitting space as well. 

Another tip, they post their daily specials on their website if you want to check ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Very organized service. The porchetta was excellent. The tomato soup was okay. I will go back for the meat and bread."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say, except wow is so tender and the selection while limited is done absolutely on point. With a selection of I think for sandwiches and one choice of salad as an accompaniment this place is a must. Price point is super affordable, and whether it's for a quick visits meeting or just a casual lunch with friends this place is absolutely amazing and an absolute do not miss I highly recommend this place and we back I can imagine countless times in the future."}
