{"text":"Staying in town for a couple of months and this is one of by best finds. I wish I walked in earlier. I had the beef noodles in a hot stone bowl and was completely satisfied, it was delicious. I appreciated that my meal stayed hot until the last bite. Of course I had a beer and some warm sake. The room is very nice, with lots of wood and earthy tones. The service was also very good; Polite and courteous. I encourage anyone to support this restaurant which is trying to bring Prince-Arthur St. back to life."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit high for what it is (average homestyle Korean food), missing a lot of classics like japechae and overcharging for simple items like ramen ($13). Portions are super small too, for the price and while service is fairly polite and friendly the kitchen is way too slow. I'd say the reason they have so few customers is because of how slow it s. It's an alright place, but I can see why it does poorly."}
{"text":"New korean restaurant. Very cute small place and decoration. I went there with friends and we ordered bulgogi hot-dog (which was super good), kimchi jiggae (which was okay and it was really spicy for me and friend who normally eats spicy stuffs more than myself, I wasn't able to finish it), ramen, and soondubu jiggae (tasted my friend's soup and it was quite good). Downside is they don't give side dishes like other korean restaurants in Montreal. So we ordered their kimchi, I must say it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant, le service est excellent et la nourriture est très bonne 
à recommander !!!"}
{"text":"Really liked the bibimap on the stone bowl ( was very hot) and the miso soup. Dumplings were ok, because they are fried and not steamed

Place is gorgeous and very clean."}
{"text":"We came here at 9pm, ordered right after we sat down. The place was pretty empty, only two other tables were seated. At 9:55, the waiter came by saying it was \" too late \" to place the order and that wed have to wait another 15 minutes. Absolutely ridiculous! Do not come here"}
{"text":"Great little place. Kimchi dumplings and bibimpop were both very good. Service was stellar. Glad we made it our first stop in Montreal."}
{"text":"Just re-ordered from this place and order literally came in 15 min! 
Currently eating the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Meilleur bibimbap que j'ai mangé! On te sert une énorme quantité pour un prix vraiment raisonnable. L'ambiance est relaxe, le service super poli et la déco est belle. Le restaurant se retrouve dans un joli coin de Montréal et c'est un détour à faire si on est de passage dans la grande ville!"}
{"text":"Ample space , friendly service and good flavor. The portions were a bit small, and the prices of appetizers were overpriced. I miss so much Korean's BBQ but they only offer beef ribs BBQ. Brewed beer was great for me.

Not recommended budae chigae for two ~just like instant noodles and a few meats with some kimchi"}
{"text":"I love this new Korean restaurant. We had some plum wine and the Budae Chigae for two is absolutely spectacular! 

The staff was super friendly and explained what we should do with the boiling pot on the table. Their hot sauce was also surprisingly good on its own. 

We'll certainly be back and it's nice to see life coming back to Prince Arthur street!"}
{"text":"Comfortable, cozy, and minimalistic natural atmosphere. There's this cute fake cherry blossom tree we sat under.
Came here on a weekday for lunch so there were no other customers there.
Service was fast and friendly.
There menu has an array of appetizers, as well as mains and drinks. We got shrimp tempura, takoyaki, beef tartare and soba. 
The tempura was actually ebi fry (the breading is panko and not tempura batter), so they need to rename that. 
Takoyaki and the soba were both pretty good. Portions were a bit on the small size but it was tasty and what you would expect.
The beef tartare however, was frozen. Like icy chunks of raw meat frozen. We ended up asking them to fry up our tartare so it became bulgogi of sorts. I thought tartare was made from fresh meat only?
Also, I got the sweet pancake and rice drink which were a delight! 
I think the food is priced reasonably, but can be improved. I would come here again to try their other items though! It seems that they are better at Korean food so maybe I just chose the wrong items."}
{"text":"Portions are extremely small for the price. Paying $13 for a small bowl of rice and a bit of spicy soup. Apps portions are tiny as well, like money evaporating. Just not worth the money here. Many better options on this street. Look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great food and decor, not too expensive and awesome homemade hot sauce. The service is great and the menu is pretty varied. There's a lot of Japanese and Korean food. The ramen portions are pretty big too."}
{"text":"Everything was really, really delicious. I especially liked the \"Korean style seafood patty.\" I also ordered seaweed salad, boiled shrimp dumplings, and fried seaweed rolls--all top notch.

I opted to order only appetizers because there were so many choices that sounded tasty. If I go back, I think I'd try the hotpot.

The service was more on the slow side given there were only two other people in the restaurant, but it wasn't overly problematic because I wasn't in a hurry. The interior decor is cute."}
{"text":"Went with their Bibimbap dish ($13) which was served in a piping hot stone bowl. The presentation of the plate was excellent, very colourful and appealing. As a side-dish I was also given soup since the Bibimbap is quite a dry fish and the occasional sip of the soup allows you to keep going.

The plate was full-flavoured and quite enjoyable. I don't have extensive experience with Korean cuisine but I definitely want to after this meal.

Service was fast and polite. Soup refill without even asking! Waitress didn't speak much, if at all, not sure if this is how service is done so... I'll go with traditional Asian experience. :)

Negasake has a nice dining setting without being overbearing on the Asian theme. Pretty fake tree?  Very quiet, no other patrons so I'm unsure if location is bad or I came in at the wrong time. Or perhaps there's much better elsewhere?

Either way, I liked it and I want to experience more Korean cuisine!"}
{"text":"Came here because the line at Kantapia was too long haha. I had the bibimbap and it was pretty good! A sufficient portion for $13. I didn't like the kimchi much though and the soup was pretty salty. I did really like the interior and atmosphere (granted it was a little empty) and service was decent. I think I may come here but not if Kantapia has space."}
{"text":"I got some takeout from this place because I was hankering for some Korean food.

Found this joint because it was near I was saying. I got a spice beef bone soup (originally wanted pork bone but they were out).

Pros: Nice, clean place; flavorful food; efficient service.

Cons: More expensive than I think is justified.

Overall: If you want a good meal that will leave you feeling nourished and satisfied afterword, I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been seeing a lot of tumbleweed on Prince-Arthur lately. I'm so glad that this place opened up! 

Their dishes are bright, tasty, and varied. I had a thoroughly pleasant bibimbap with chicken - good proportions, not too heavy, comforting. My friends selected a bibimbap with beef, a fancy hotdog, and some awesome potato croquettes with various types of sauces. 

The interior feels very relaxing and spacious. I'll definitely visit again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Belle découverte! Beau restaurant, bonne cuisine. La serveuse était très gentille et nous a bien conseillé. J'ai commandé un Bibimbap avec tartare de buf. C'était délicieux. J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner pour goûter à un autre plat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super affordable and legit, wide variety of Korean food choices. It's also open late which saved me last weekend when I got back to Montreal late and needed somewhere to eat at 9:30 on a Sunday night.

I've been twice and ordered different things both times. The first time I split the Korean BBQ special with my boyfriend. It was really good and there was a TON of food. The only thing I didn't like is that the bulgogi had bones in every piece.
We also ordered the kimchi pancake with pork and egg as a starter. Super delicious and filling. 

The next time I went I got classic beef bimbimbap which was a huge portion and super delicious. It was enough that I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. I got the octopus balls as starters- didn't like these that much but I think that's just a personal taste thing. 

Can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu. Also service is super fast and the wait staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Worse attitude from the owner!!!

Attitude can make up for certain situations but can also bring you down in others if your attitude is despicable! Well, this is the case of this restaurant. The food itself is probably worth 3*, but the attitude we reserved from the owner (I assume she was the owner ~ short hair lady) was one of the worse I've experienced!

Went there with my family to eat and my grandma is  in a wheelchair. Asked if we can seat closer to the window where there is less traffic because my grandma's wheelchair can sometimes get in the way. Instead of telling us that the table was reserved or explaining why it wouldn't be a good idea to seat there, the owner gave us this horrible look/face as she didn't want our business because we asked her to move...we didn't even seat down yet. 

Not to mention that we didn't receive any help from the staff or owner to get the wheelchair in or to remove the chair so that my grandma's wheelchair can fit at the table. We have been eating at many restaurants on Prince Arthur and all the other restaurants we've been told, the staff helped us he best way they could. Needless to mention that the restaurant is also empty every time we passed by...and it was almost empty the night we went there. 

I didn't want to make a big deal of of this as moving around with a wheelchair isn't easy so we just sat at the table they originally assigned us. 

Food was just ok...seafood pancake was mushy. The seafood tofu soup was the worse I've had. The seafood inside was rubbery and didn't taste fresh. As a matter of fact, I saw the owner bringing a big bag of mixed frozen seafood from the basement so I'm sure that's what has been used to make the soup.

Asked for hot water and the waiter forgot...when he finally brought us the water, it was in a beer glass. The water was so hot that it made it impossible to hold the glass...don't tell me that an Anshan restaurant doesn't have proper tea cup or coffee mugs?!?

Definitely the worse Korean restaurant I've been to. Food is just ok...I mean it is edible but don't waste your money there. You are better off going to eat at McDonald than at this place. Worse of all is the service...with such a shitty attitude from the owner, she doesn't deserve to get any business!

Will never return or recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went to Negasake with a group of 10 for a birthday party. Food was delicious, received constant praises from everyone around the table! Korean BBQ for 2 is a must try - satisfying and good value. The service was superb! The servers were pleasant and helped us decorate a surprise birthday cake! Overall wonderful experience! Would definitely go back for other menu items!"}
{"text":"Très joli cadre et très bon plats copieux :-) 
Dolsot bibimpab excellent et korea style! Manque juste la bière coréenne pour compléter le côté authentique du repas coréen :)"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a couple days for the Grand Prix, after a few days of eating junk at the track, I was definitely craving a more balanced meal. I ordered the takoyaki and bibimbap and the bf got the chicken ramen, all of them were good. Portions are big and the service very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice indoor / average korean food. I love korean food (korean BBQ / kimchi pancake (kimchee jeon) / soju / makgeolli /...) being 2 times in South Korea, so I wanted to try this new korean restaurant with my gf in my neighborhood and help the local economy on Prince-Arthur street. We were kindly greeted by the waitress, there was only another korean couple eating, it was very quiet actually for a Thursday evening but for sure, it was just being opened since 2 days. The indoor is nice and simple, asian/korean modern style. We had kimchis, a bibimbap beef & a korean tofu soup (soondubu jjigae). Honestly, the kimchis didn't taste that good and the bibimbap was very average quality, foodcourt taste, the spicy sauce with the bibimbap tasted weird, the tofu soup was good though. Am I too difficult ? I was expecting more from this place and I'm sure in Montreal, we can find better quality koreans restaurants than this one. Service was good, the waitress was always checking on us. Prices were cheap. Got sick with a liquid d..... less than 2h after that. Food poisoning? Low quality food ? No ideas but not cool, not for me anymore, thanks. Wish them good business really because this part of Prince-Arthur is dead. I wished I could have liked this place. 2/5 Visited in March 2015."}
{"text":"With Prince-Arthur street looking sadder and sadder by the day, I do hope Negasake will stick around. If you like soups/stews, then this is the place for you. Not all of them spicy too, so there's something to cater for everyone's taste. 

I had the spicy tofu and beef stew, served with rice, and it was excellent. The sweetness of the beef was a nice complement to the spiciness of the soup. On the other hand, I wasn't impressed with their shrimp tempura. The batter was too thick and not the typical tempura batter. 

My stew portion was large (so very good value for money) and when I looked around the table, everybody else's food came in L too and only one person in the end could finish his (the guy's a big eater). 

Ambiance was very lovely and while it's always nice to have companions, I can see myself coming here by myself. The tables are small enough, but can be moved around for groups. The floor to ceiling glass windows make for excellent people watching too. Seating comfort, however, was questionable. Most of the seats are backless stools, which are fine, but the problem is that they are too high for the tables so you end up with a crooked back. Hopefully they can somehow correct this."}
{"text":"Being the rising star of international cuisines, Korean food definitely is one of the most appreciated dishes within the multi-ethnic city of Montreal. Negasake offers tasty Korean food with great inside atmosphere.

This place is for sharing. It probably is a good idea to order a bunch of different entrees to have among the group of people. Mainly because the place provides a relaxing atmosphere, this spot seems like a perfect dating destination.

My friend and I had a bowl of Korean Cold Noodle, Ramyun, and a grilled eel. Cold noodle was the most outstanding dish in my opinion. Although it was winter (or because it was winter), the cold noodle provided the rare experience of cold on cold with me. However, I guess the base of the broth is not quite common in Canada. I would recommend anyone who cherishes the combination of sour and sweet taste.

Legit good food."}
{"text":"We were walking around looking for a good place to eat. All the options my wife suggested turned out to be closed or full, so I pulled my phone, opened the Yelp app. and we found this place. This place was perfect. Fast service, great food, vegan and neat option. Exactly what we needed."}
{"text":"everything was very tasty from the spicy tofu soup which was a bit too salty, the beef tartare was a bit frozen but the taste is to the point, the fried sticky rice on a stick was a bit too sweet, the combination is a win because the flavour really melted perfectly together :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I come here, i always end up full and love the food! The servers are all korean and really polite as well. I would really recommend anything on their menu but I always tend to get the soondoobujjigae (soft spicy tofu soup) and it's soo good! The patbingsoo (shaved bean ice cream) isn't that note-worthy though so I wouldn't get it, but really other than that, everythings pretty delicious. Their prices are also really reasonable as well. They even have an AYCE meat section now too and it's actually pretty cheap for an AYCE and what it includes. Would come here again! :)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a beautiful little restaurant. You can tell that the owner really cherishes this spot and put in their love to decorate the interior. 

FOOD: I had the takoyaki, chicken cutlet and seafood pancake. Honestly, it wasn't the BEST I've had but it wasn't too bad. The takoyaki pieces were a little bit small in my opinion, the chicken cutlet's sauce tasted a little bit like plastic and the seafood pancake tasted a bit burnt. However, it didn't ruin my meal.

PRICE: Prices aren't too expensive. I definitely think that you can go to better spots with the price that you're paying but coming here won't break your bank.

SERVICE: The servers are very friendly and work very hard to make sure that you are happy with your experience here. Love them!"}
{"text":"Very clean and nicely decorated Korean restaurant. Large portions and very reasonably priced.

Had the Budae Chigae for two - very tasty and we were both extremely full!

We will definitely return to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Why is this place always empty? Their food is solid, their prices are decent, their restaurant is cozy, the service is great... this place should be packed all day every day.

I've had their bibimbap and their stir fry udon and both were almost on par with k-town in nyc which is a high level to aspire for.

Please support this place. Prince Arthur needs more quality joints like it."}
