{"text":"This place is really good. They have good lunch specials and friendly staff. There are a few other Asian places in the area but this one is by far the best."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  I have tried several different menu items and they have all been wonderful.  Reasonable prices too!  My daughter believes they have one of the best curry dishes she has ever had."}
{"text":"I love Blossom. The staff greet me by name, the food is delicious and if you don't see what you want on the menu, their chef will make it for you.  The prices are more than fair and reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Me and my wife come here at least once a month.  Im not a walnut fan, but you have to try the walnut shrimp.  Decent size shrimps to boot.  Great portions, family meals, great staff, clean restraunt.  WHY ARENT YOU EATING HERE YET!  Family amd kid friendly too."}
{"text":"I'm not one to be super picky about takeout Chinese food from hole's in the wall but this place was super bland.  I cant even remember what I ordered a week later.  I will probably try it one more time and see if its any better.  Place was clean and friendly just not to my liking of Chinese take out.  BUT out here in the south west valley in the oh so lovely town of Tolleson I should be grateful for a restaurant that is not a chain and that there actually is a Chinese restaurant.   Try them of you live out here.  Maybe it was just me.  I wanted to give it a 2 based on the \"Meh, I've had better\" thing. But I just cant, they weren't awful or anything just not to my liking."}
{"text":"Major success here.  I love it.  We went twice in two days just to make sure it was good and they totally passed!  New favorite Chinese place."}
{"text":"Great food. Kinda slow service even when called ahead for eat in. Soup is good and quantity of the food is large"}
{"text":"Have been going here for 4 years since I bought a house in Tolleson and have never had any issues with anything I've ever ordered.  Tammy is the best and has even given suggestions on different ways to spice up regular dishes on many occasions.  My favorite is the house chow fun noodles cooked in chili sauce. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is my quick go to spot. Traditional items that taste great. SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING."}
{"text":"This is not a bad little Chinese food place. It's very clean inside and the employees are friendly. The food is relatively inexpensive and satisfying, even if it's not of mind-blowing quality. It's a good place to hit up on a weeknight when you don't feel like cooking or going broke."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I always order the same things; the lemon chicken is my favorite. I like it with the saice on the side, which they glady do it for me. The service could be better, but the food is so worth thr bad service."}
{"text":"Hard to find good Chinese. This place was ok. I will say the service was really good, but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Staff is incredible and beyond helpful. There recommendations are always on point and are never a disappointment. The food is extravagant and the low prices are a plus. They even have vegetarian options. Definitely recommend whether you're trying to just get food and go or done in and hang out. Number one spot in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place has  great food  the  waitresses are   very  nice ,the service  is  excellent.We love  their  Shrimp Lo Mein,Orange Chicken,egg rolls are  good  also,Our family  will be  going back  to this  restaurant  again and  again,give  it  a try   its  Delicious...only one  thing  I  wish  they would  make  better,is  their  egg foo young   dishes,other than that   We  love  it............"}
{"text":"Visiting this area found Blossom on Yelp and we were not disappointed.  The food (seafood tofu soup and chicken with veggies) was flavorful and portions were right for the price.  Although a bit slow the servers were attentive and pleasant.  Clean and comfortable strip mall location.  I would return"}
{"text":"Good, but not great Chinese food. Very consistent. Pleasant staff and restaurant is always very clean. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food and their service is always excellent. Plus, it's clean, always a bonus!"}
{"text":"Can't be beat for food quality, service, and price. We saw this on Yelp near a place we are renting for a few weeks. We had the hot and sour soup and sweet and sour chicken. Both were great....the soup even had a couple of large shrimp in it.   The staff was very friendly and service was fast.  Made us wish we could spend more time nearby. Thanks for a super meal!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch and dinner at this family owned restaurant and I'm always leaving happy and full.  And it's clean inside, too. The servers are always friendly and have wanted to give recommendations about other dishes to try.  Last night, she told me that fried foods were not actually fattening, so I took that as a cue to devour both my egg roll and deep fried shrimp! It's always made to order so everything comes out hot and fresh.  Aside from the deep fried appetizers, I think this place can actually be a healthy place to eat, too. The dinner entrees with chicken were about $7, beef $8, seafood $9.  Lunch specials were around $5."}
{"text":"I came here because of the good food reviews. It tasted like they took frozen chicken and fried it and poured some sauce on it. We got the General tso s chicken and orange chicken. The \"fried \" rice tasted like white rice dabbed in watered down soy sauce.  No veggies or egg in it. It wasn't good and the service sucked because the tables were not clean.  They  didn't even ask for a refill until it was time to pay the check. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Lunch special is great! More than enough, just know that if you take out it doesnt come with soup. Confusing."}
{"text":"Friendly service+ great food= good time!  This place is on the side of the FRy's shopping plaza. It is small, but veryclean and nice. The portions are agood size. You get soup with your meal. Pretty good"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday based on Yelp teviews. First of all the emplyees were very nice and attentive. The bbq pork lo mein was very good but was surpised that was all that came with dinner portion. No won tons, no soup no rice. Maybe they come with other dishes. Environment was ok but they can definitely use a makeover. Will go there again if I am in tolleson and have a hankering for chinese food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out the food was very Bland noodles were soggy won't be going there again"}
{"text":"It has been quite the challenge to find good Chinese food in AZ. But I love this place. From the customer service to the quality of food, we are never disappointed. I am a huge fan of their fried rice and wonton soup. My 5 year old loves the sesame chicken, and their beef skewers are good. We find that the best value is either the dinner for about 19.99 or getting the food to go. For some reason, we get more to-go than eating there. But either way the quality is good. The servers remember your names and family. They are genuine provide great reasons to return. We eat there about every other week. If you want to try them, go lunch. You cannot beat their prices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighbood restaurants, my family and I love this place. My favorite. Dish is the curry shrimp,  or delicious!"}
{"text":"Blossom Asian Cuisine is one of my best Chinese Food in town.  The price ranges for their food are phenomenon because is very inexpensive.  Their service has always been amazing.  I would highly recommend this Chinese restaurant for good quality of food (plenty of food) and their reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This little gem was recommended by a couple of friends.  It's a little store front in a strip mall.  Inside, I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff, affordable prices, quality of food and quantity. The veggies are fresh (color & crisp) and you can make out the ingredients in the sauces.  Since Golden Phoenix closed down in downtown Phoenix years ago, I've been on the prowl for something comparable.  I will continue to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Love there sesame chicken. I can eat it cold and it's still crunchy and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is consistant with it's good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is ok. It's not real Chinese food. It's pretty Americanized, but I guess you'd never unless you've been to China or eat at a Chinatown in a Metropolis. The people who work here are really nice though. So many other Chinese places to try though, twice is enough for me."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but food was very good. Had vegetable tofu."}
{"text":"Very clean and AWESOME service!    I ordered vegetable tofu.  It was a little salty for me but I normally eat a low sodium diet.   The tofu was cut in lage cubes, firm & cooked just right.   Son ordered sesame chicken.  He said it was sweeter than expected but still good.  Large portion so it was enough to share or to take home for lunch the next day.   Spouse ordered schezuwan chicken.  He said it was spicy.  This tells me it had some heat to it as he eats a lot of spicy food. He also ordered the wanton soup which he devoured.  It had shrimp and he said it was very fresh."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The food is amazing everything was crispy and bursting with flavor. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"They have the best staff and the most amazing curry my boyfriend  and I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  Love their lunch menu. Their orange chicken and shrimp with vegetables are my favorite. Their food is very flavorful and their portions are generous!   Def recommend!!"}
{"text":"What! $5.25 lunch special? Soup, eggroll, wonton, then fried rice and entree? You've got to be kidding me right? Sorry, Charlie, but that is correct!  This sit down Chinese Restaurant is near my school where the majority of teachers get their lunch fix. I joined some of them during a summer planning day. The restaurant is small, but the service is big. You can usually hit or miss with Asian service. Why do I say that? Because I'm Asian. Although they are friendly, smiles all around, and know their repeat customers.  I chose the hot & sour soup. What do I look for in my hot & sour? I'll tell you what I don't like. I don't like watery run down soup. It has to have a level of thickness. It also can't be too hot or sour (obviously). Both flavors need to compliment one another, not overpower. I do like a heavy dose of tofu and veggies as well. As a result, this soup seemed to meet the criteria, and was quite nice to taste.  The eggroll and wonton were not overly breaded, and the crispiness had a nice crunch that did not get messy. I chose the orange chicken for my entree and it hit the spot. The flavor from the sauce was right on, and it was evenly deep fried to provide a subtle crunch that did not take away from the chicken.  Overall, I like the lunch special and service. I don't want to say typical Chinese food, but they are above average at what they do in regards to service and quality of food. I will definitely be back again and look forward to good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Blossom is a great little hole-in-the-wall place to get yummy food and friendly service.  So far, I've only been there three times, but the way they remember their customers, along with their genuine kindness and helpfulness has made an impression upon me.  All three times, I've had takeout. First, the walnut shrimp: breaded, deep fried, juicy shrimp in a rich, creamy sauce, with tons of glazed walnuts and fresh broccoli. The egg rolls are also satisfyingly yummy(nothing special, but good).  Recently, I've been sick, and their wonton soup has been...a blessing. Seriously. A huge container costs around $5, and it's chock-full of savory pork-filled wontons, snap peas, water chestnuts, chicken, shrimp, baby corn, carrots, and onions, all swimming in a delectable broth. Wonderful on a chilly January evening :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is fresh and authentic. The gals that run the floor are the sweetest, friendly, and helpful. They always make sure that you are completely satisfied when you're dining in or even taking out. My favorites are hot and sour soup, singaporean mai fun, sesame chicken, garlic beef, twice cooked pork, their crispy and spicy garlic shrimp I believe it's called off of the house specials is really good too. Their fried rice is steaming hot and is not too oily/greasy. The portions are fairly big for the price you pay, plus they use fresh, never frozen ingredients. So you pay for the quality of the food as well."}
{"text":"Quality food for a really good value.  Had the Walnut Shrimp, crab won tons and the House Soup tonight and everything was great!  I don't usually find myself this far west, but if you are in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in. Also, call in your order before you arrive and it will likely be ready when you get there.  This place is really quick."}
{"text":"the food is awesome. 5 years here in arizona and never came across decent chinese food. cantonese they specialize in. this gem is tucked away in a small strip mall on lower buckeye road. my family and i enjoy the food and not to mention the staff. you need to try it~ everything is fresh, even the chow fun noodles. great size portion too."}
{"text":"Ive been there 2 times and thats about 2 times too many.    Not a big fan."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome. The food didn't taste right. We ordered orange chicken, sesame chicken and beef and broccoli and it all just seemed off. The fried rice that comes with the lunch specials tasted like play-doh. Crab puffs were tasty! But all in all we probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Got take-out. Very friendly staff, reasonable prices, good food. I will be back!   As I waited for my order, I saw the huge portions they served to dine in guests. It was clean and smelled delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great prices, service, and fresh food.  We had the orange chicken and the walnut shrimp. All was high quality, giant portions, and well-priced."}
{"text":"We have gone here for years, and make the trip even after we moved further away.  The staff and food are great!   They make us Sesame Beef even though it is not on the menu - yum!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time during my lunch break the other day and it was delicious! They have GREAT lunch specials. I tried the orange chicken, and it was so great I had to bring some home to my boyfriend to try! The woman at the counter was extremely friendly as well. I will definitely be returning (:"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly staff, this place has the best Chinese food I've had in the west valley!! Do yourself a favor and try the salt and pepper squid and Singapore rice noodles."}
{"text":"Great food, good service!  Been here twice and the food is amazing.  Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Delicious food, large portions, cheap and quick. We ordered 2 meals for takeout (dinner combos) and both had enough for at least another meal entirely! Will come back for more soon!"}
{"text":"We called late on Xmas eve and they were going to close early, but thank goodness they were able to accommodate us.  They were more than happy to have our take-out order ready, and fast.  Everything was great and the family was impressed.  We especially liked the Kung Pao Chicken.  Also ordered the Jalepeno Chicken Wings (just ok, a little overcooked), Potstickers (good), and Orange Chicken (yum). Also included in our order were egg rolls (good, would have been perfect if not a little overcooked), fried rice (so-so), steamed rice (fine), and two fried shrimp (yum).  Definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Just went here place was very messy tables were sitting dirty for over 30 minutes.  We had Black Pepper Chicken  was cold and bland . I would advise looking elsewhere for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is great and service is too. We get take out and they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side . That works well. Very friendly, and the place is clean, no funny odors."}
{"text":"Great Service! But, the actual food wasn't that great...  In an unusual twist, this was the first Chinese place I went that had good service. There was an older lady there who was very conversational. She was very pleasant and was very nice to my kids. She was like that with the other customers as well, which surprised me since I'm not used to that level of attention at Chinese food places.  The reason I only give this place 3 stars is because I just didn't really like the food. I found everything to be kind of bland. It wasn't bad, but neither was it overtly good. They also committed the cardinal sin of making the crab puffs sweet, and I hate sweet crab puffs. It's unfortunate that so many Chinese food places make them sweet.   I don't see myself returning to this restaurant in the future. I think I'd rather take rude service, but with good food than the other option."}
{"text":"Please...ignore... pay ZERO attention to the reviewer who depleted stars from their review because they didn't get enough soy sauce. Are you serious?? They also complained about not having left overs (??) You are correct to never return. No one needs THAT vibe... ugh... Annoying...   ANYWAY... on to bigger and grander. Blossom is wonderful....consistent. Affordable. Friendly... I AM ADDICTED. I need to stop ...seriously.    There is PLENTY OF FOOD for the next lunch. (especially if you arrive in time for the lunch special) The ONLY reason I didn't have any left overs of my sweet and sour chicken (once) is because I made a total PIG of myself EATING ALLL OF IT during lunch!   I ordered over the phone and the moment I walked in, someone greeted me with, \"Your sweet and sour chicken is on its way.\" I had called maybe five mins before. I am three mins away and called from my flippin' car! This is the same reception I'd get whether they're busy or slow.   I love the food! I love the service... LOVE ALL OF IT."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food. Today was my first time in and got the Kung pao chicken , orange chicken, lo mein and two egg rolls let me tell you this place is good and the service was awesome just like I read in the reviews. Will defenetly be coming back. Very nice interior and comfortable seating arrangments. All employees are in uniform and very nice. been living in Phoenix for 8 months and havent been able to find a place so good until now. Defenetly going to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Omg! Couldn't find a single complaint. Put in an order for pick up, food was done when I got there. The lady was super nice! The food was amazing and the portion size was huge! We did the family meal for two. Got orange chicken, Mongolian beef, wonton soup, fried rice and the sampler appetizer all for just over $30. The two of us got through the soup, appetizer and we were stuffed! We had a few bites of both entrees just to try them before we packed up the leftovers. Super delicious and definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Friggin love this place! The food is amazing every single time! Great portions for your money, egg drop soup on point and that teriyaki chicken tho..  This place is super popular I'd say in the neighborhood and our police officers can often be found taking lunch and dinner breaks there!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here the customer service is great.  The food is absolutely good and the portions are good for the price as well.  Their spicy calamari is a must try and their egg drop soup is super delicious. The place is clean and the wait time is never long. I would definitely recommend this place if your in the area and want to have some great tasting food."}
{"text":"Great authentic food! Quick take out and amazing service inside. Love the jalapeño chicken and my son loves their orange chicken!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over 3 years now. Their food is great and even better when you are able to dine in. I find that Chinese food tends to get soggy when you take out but that's not their fault.   Currently my order of choice is the walnut shrimp. It's fried, covered in a sweet sauce and served with broccoli. My husband always orders Orange beef because he likes his beef fried and crisp (not on the menu).   We make the small trip to tolleson from laveen to eat here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place quite a few times and they are not consistent. My firsy visit I ordered kung pao chicken with \"no peanuts\". Got home and saw peanuts, took it back to be corrected.....returned home a second time enjoying the lunch special only to find 3 peanuts at the bottom of the container. Assumed tgey jyst picked out what they saw earlier?! Thankfully im NOT allergic. Sometimes the food is delish and on point, other times not fully cooked. The last time I orerrd there I didn't finish my lunch meal.  Thought I would enjoy the rest for dinner. Nope, the food had a rotten smell and nasty white goo/slime on the meat and veggies. How does food \"expire/root\" 8 hours later after sitting on your counter in styrafoam? Won't ever eat there again."}
{"text":"First time at Blossom Asian Cuisine. Came here based in Yelp reviews.   I arrived at 1:15 on a Tuesday for lunch. There were four tables still finishing up, so I got fast service. I ordered the lunch special with Kung Pao Beef and an Arizona Iced Tea for $8.15 plus tip.   The meal came with choice of soup, egg roll, fried wonton plus brown rice. The egg roll and wonton came after I was halfway finished with my entree.   The Kung Pao was average at best. The sauce was just lacking any flavor. Too bad. With all the sides being average except the good soup, i can't rate this any higher.   The staff was engaging with the customers, which got them their second star from me.   The restroom was deplorable.  It smelled bad, it was out of towels and the floor was dirty.   Can't recommend this to my coworkers."}
{"text":"Very clean, freshly prepared food! Would highly recommend it and the owners are very very friendly."}
{"text":"First off when i eat chinese food i like to drink the hot tea which this place does not serve which is just my personal preference not everyones.  Customer service here isnt that great, but the price point for the food is on point and the taste is pretty good compared to most the other restaurants in this area that serves chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall delicious fresh food find! Owners are personable and kind and they provide great food and service."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The food is great and inexpensive; the service is even better. They are sweet and kind. This Asian food is certainly the best in the area."}
{"text":"5th time and i've been here and its the 5th time they get everything right!!! prices are great. the food is gourmet tasting and the service is on the spot!!!"}
{"text":"The lunch special was the best. $5something for kung pao chicken, egg roll, crab ragoon, and egg drop soup. Tasted fresh. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came in here and it wasn't very busy, we sat right away. The server was a nice lady, and the food came out right away! We had some egg rolls and I had the spicy shrimp. The food was hot and delicious. The decor of the restaurant is very cute too. Restaurant is on the smaller side, but it's cozy. First time here and it won't be our last! Reasonable prices, Delicious food, and good service!"}
{"text":"Wont be going back.. Read the good reviews so went..   It wasn't bad & they had crab ragoons that we miss at our local takeout.   They only gave 3 soy sauce. Didn't give red sauce for the ragoons. If I hadn't ask for duck sauce we wouldn't have gotten any sauce.    They didn't actually have duck sauce but she brought me some of the ragoon sauce that was supposed to be in the bag.. bag was all tied off so I couldn't check on sauces without ripping it....   The portions are small nothing left for lunch next day  Men's room was nasty dirty.  She asked me if I wanted fried rice or white rice. I said fried so they just put soy sauce on white rice and boxed it up. It wasn't fried rice..   House fried rice tasted old. How did this place get all these good reviews?   Our local takeout place has sauce out for the picking. & everything is fresh & clean. Larger protons for the money.  Will stay with them."}
{"text":"Great prices and great food. Love the lemon chicken for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place again after waiting over a year. The employees were some of the friendliest people ever. Still as much as I wanted to like this place the food doesnt cut it for me, I quit halfway through my dinner because it was so bland. I had the shrimp chow mein and general tso's."}
{"text":". Got the Kung pao chicken and the orange chicken. Very cheap lunch special and good food!! Service was also very good"}
{"text":"It was disappointing to see good reviews on this place and the food tasted horrible. No authenticity whatsoever. It felt that they just thawed out everything and warmed it up. I ordered the sizzling rise soup.  Didn't find any flavor. Just hot water, vegetables, and Rice Krispies pretty much. Now I know why I waited 9 years to try this place. I'm never going back. My family also tried different plates. But no one seemed impressed.  Food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Best Hot and Sour soup EVER! Get the cup, you won't regret it. The woman working there customized my order to fit my vegetarian lifestyle. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is just around the corner from us, great tasting food at good prices, friendly people working here, good menu range, doesnt taste like frozen food like some places. If you're in the area dont waste time on panda come here for some better tasting food for around the same price of a double plate at panda you can get a full meal here."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying my rating is probably on the favorable side for this place. The food is in the 3-3.5 star range but the price alone is worth an extra star.  The food is like most Chinese places, it's solid but not spectacular. I usually get the lunch combo to go and stick to my favorites like Kung Pao or Orange Chicken. They fit the bill and are tasty if unassuming. The Kung Pao lacks the kick I would like and is a little more runny on the sauce then I like but that is more of preference than taste. A little spicy mustard kicks the kung pao right up. The orange chicken is orange chicken.  Like I said I get the lunch combo which includes an egg roll (pretty decent one too) and 1 crab rangoon along with some fried rice. All that with a fairly healthy size portion of the main course and all that is only $5. So you really can't beat the deal.  I also like the hot and sour soup which is slightly above-par for what you find most places.  On the service side they are quick and friendly. I can call on my way out the door of work and they will have my food ready by the time i get there 5-10 minutes later.  So if you are craving some Chinese for lunch you should probably stop by here, you won't be wow'd but you won't be disappointed either.   P.S. I think it is awesome that they sell NFL Team hats too."}
{"text":"First time I went food had an odd taste. Decided to give it another try, been wonderful ever since. Must've been an off day for them. Delicious. Good, affordable lunch. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Where Everyone Knows Your Name   Blossom Asian  Cuisine has some of the best tasting food that is different from any other Asian restaurant I've eaten at. The food was amazing and service was great.  Loved the atmosphere too.   I was surprised to see how many customere the staff knew by name.  Not only does the staff know of a lot of their  customers by name but the staff at Blossoms Asian Cuisine remembers the favorite dishes of their regular customers.  Now that's what I call customer service.  On my first visit I ordered crab puffs, teriyaki chicken, chicken egg foo young, and egg flower soup.  I Haven't had soup that good in a long time and the Chicken Egg Foo Young  is a dish I would  definitely order again.  The service at Blossom Asian Cuisone was out of this world! From sitting down and immediately having water, to drinks being brought right away. Never an empty glass. All servers were so happy and polite and just like my fellow yelper \"Laz\" said they remembered him by name.  The staff remembers many customers by name, it's nice to visit an establishment where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"I've been going here for almost 10 years. Always friendly, fresh and affordable. Love the twice cooked pork and the Singapore noodles!!! They have great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"Ordered food here for pickup, got the walnut shrimp and general tsos with fried rice and white rice, along with the calamari and the crab rangoons. Rangoons were pretty good id reorder those, the calamari was pretty bad and not very fresh it was kinda oily. The walnut shrimp is not to be compared to panda express but it is definitely tasty. The shrimp have way more of a batter on it but the sauce tends to be the same with the candied walnuts. The general tsos was okay it was kinda soggy. All this totaled to around $35 but I'd say the portions that I received were more than enough to last a couple days after. Would return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Had to update my current review on here. Been going to Blossom for a year now and this is our go to restaurant.  The staff is always so friendly to us and we never have a long wait for food. The food is always consistently top notch. No delivery option but always a great place for pick up/ dine in for those nights that you don't feel like cooking. Walnut shrimp are simply fantastic."}
{"text":"We live close and love the Blossom. The Wonton soup is excellent. Everything we have tried here has been very good. It is clean and the service is always great. I would recommend anyone give it a try."}
{"text":"My first time here and I have to say really good food. Portions were more than I could handle which I love since that means lunch for tomorrow. I ordered take out and the woman was super nice and triple checked that I had everything and that it was all correct. Place was really empty but it is in an overlooked spot. I'd say a gem I found. Not amazing but very good for the west side and its close to me too. thats a +. Will definately go back again. sweet and sour chicken with dumplings was perfect.  I would say to put up a menu so people can get a good idea of what you offer."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Always fresh highly recommend the orange chicken, egg rolls. authentic Chinese food restaurant is very clean and workers are very friendly!"}
{"text":"I agree with Veronica on this. We went on a recommendation from H and R Block next door. Probably the worst Chinese food ever. Teriyaki chicken tasted like it had freezer burn. The eggrolls were so greasy you could wring the grease out of them. Horrid. Don't know how they stay in business. Would give zero stars if I could. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Very Very good food at a reasonable price. The friendly owners are charming and hospitable. This is a great place and I always visit  here when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great service & food every time we go! We usually get fried rice, the lemon chicken,  sweet & sour chicken,  & Mongolian beef. We have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awsome. Every time my wife and son and I go it's always fresh. Excellent service. They know everyone by name. Everything I have ever ordered is 5 stars. When ever people ask me for a good Chinese spot it's Blossom. Thanks for great food and great service."}
{"text":"The food was definitely not the best. The fried rice wasn't even fried rice. The chow mein was flavorless and the sesame chicken had to much flour. The service was great but I came here for the food not the service."}
{"text":"They are about three minutes from my house, and they have good food! I always get the sweet and sour for my hubby, he likes it. I like the orange chicken, not the best, but good! The crab puffs are good too! The lo mein is really good, especially considering it is Tolleson. Anyone who lives in the area, I recommend it when looking for a Chinese takeout fix."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese, so on my way house from work I stopped in to order take out. Ordered chicken wings, egg flower soup, pork egg foo young, and wok fried chicken. The pork egg foo young and wok fried chicken was too salty. The chicken wings and egg flower soup was OK. I am not sure if I would try it again."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food spot. The food is AMAZING. egg rolls are huge and not very greasy. Ordered the beef garlic, chicken lettuce, egg flower soup and egg rolls and they were hands down the best I've had ever. Definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"Another Americanized Chinese restaurant. Ordered the twice cooked pork and jalapeño beef. Nothing close to traditional Chinese cooking. Can't even come close to the Chinese food in cali"}
{"text":"Maybe some might really like this. I'm just used to Chinese food from the SF Bay Area"}
{"text":"Great for Lunch. Nice portions priced right and friendly service. They've had the same great two servers here for quite some time. Hot tea is $1.95 a cup which I think is a little steep. Especially when other Chinese restaurants charge little or nothing for a bottomless cup. Seating is a little small as it gets a little busy around lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and exceptional service both dine-in and order to-go! Price is right and consistent quality will keep us coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to discover that the closest Chinese restaurant to me was so great. The servers are so friendly and helpful, the food is delicious, and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"We have gone to this place since it first opened. It is delicious! Never had a problem with our food. It is always served HOT and just made. The staff here is SOOOOO nice and the lady always asks about how are family is! She always remembers us! We love this place and my favorite is the egg drop soup and green tea! Super awesome small causual dining. The price is reasonable too! Great quality food for the right price!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize I had to ask for sweet and sour sauce for my sweet and sour pork. This was a tale out delivery, so it wasn't noticed until I got home. Food is still good though."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy! I've loved everything I've tried here so far.. House chow mein, bok choy shrimp, sesame chicken, beef chow fun.. Mmmmm. I'm here atm waiting for my lunch to go and they're so busy. I'm picky about eating Chinese food because it's gotta be legit, and this is! And the people here are super friendly, which keeps me coming back. :) if you haven't tried it out, try it!!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that my family and I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant for over 2.5 years since moving from Miami, Florida. I think we may have just found it! We were sceptical at first but straight out the service was great. As soon as we walked it we were greeted with a warm hello. We got seated and ordered our food.. the wonton soup is not what I'm used to but it was delicious, the egg rolls were too.. honestly the only complaint is have which isn't a big one but their \"fried rice\" was just rice soy sauce and egg.. again not what I'm used too.. but oh so good!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 7 other guys from work.   We saw a cockroach crawling around the room.  I found a bug in my egg drop soup.   My Dr. Pepper tasted funny so I asked for a water instead (still got charged for the soft drink). The water also tasted funny. They probably need to do some cleaning/maintenance on their fountain machine.   Nobody in our group really liked their food. Very mediocre Chinese food.   Will not go back. Only gave it two stars because the waitress was polite and responsive."}
{"text":"Hubby and I finally checked out this place and found their lunch special to be a pretty good deal. As others have mentioned, it comes with: soup, cream cheese puff, spring roll, and fried rice that was a bit bland for me. For that reason, I prefer to just make my rice plain white. We both tried the orange chicken. Meals are made to order, so the chicken tasted fresh and was soft and crispy. Yummy! My son loves Panda Express' honey walnut shrimp so we decided to have him try it here. Bad idea... He hated it. It looked really good to me. But once I took a bite, I realized why he didn't like it. The sauce is basically nothing but a pile of mayo that it grosses one out. I feel that if they could tinker around with the sauce (maybe make it more like Panda's honey walnut sauce), it'd be much better. Definitely not worth the plus $9 for that meal. My son ended up turning his nose to the shrimp and eating my food. Blah! What else... Staff is pretty friendly, esp our waitress. But I guess one other thing I can say is that the lunch combo states your comes with an egg roll, but it actually comes with a spring roll. I would suggest they update their menu to reflect what they truly serve you. No big deal on my part. I prefer the taste of egg rolls, but I can't really complain about it because it's still a pretty cheap meal. I suggest the owners make this adjustment to the menu because maybe other customers might be put off by not getting exactly what is stated on the menu."}
{"text":"I was told by co worker this is a good place , so I got the shrimp fried rice and it had zero flavor , in fact tasted like the water it probably came out of , several others did not care for what they had gotten also. good thing  didn't have to pay for it . Will be going back to Star work down the street where all the dish's I have tried over the years have been tasty"}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp fried rice and delicious won ton soup !  Best place to go when you're pregnant and have random cravings for shrimp lol"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  I called in an order for pick up, and the lady on the phone was very friendly.  I placed a large order, which was packed and ready to go when I showed up 20 mins later.  The woman who helped me (I believe she was the same one I spoke to over the phone) offered me a complimentary soda and immediately took my payment as she was assisting another gentleman simultaneously.  She was personable and helpful, making sure I had a take out menu and offering to help me carry everything out to my car.    The food was delicious!!!  The beef skewers were tender and very tasty.  Sizzling rice soup, Mongolian beef and chicken fried rice were all fresh and flavorful.  My personal favorite was the sweet & sour chicken.  They give you the sauce on the side so the breading never gets soggy.  The chicken tasted wonderful without sauce, and once you put it all together...AMAZING!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Walnut shrimp was great although maybe more like frosting shrimp since the sauce was super sweet like candy! Loved the vegetable lo mien very fresh and tasty. Only drawback would be the super attentive servers...I like staff that doesnt make you sit around but husband and I were waiting for our daughter and every 2 minutes kept asking if we were ready to order we finally ordered just to get her off our backs lol! Of course theb the food came out like 4 minutes later and daughter wasnt there yet! But we plan to go quite a few times!"}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent. The staff is very friendly and considerate.  The food is really good and they serve large portions.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"The lunch special is great. Soup, main course, rice, spring roll, and wonton. The place is very clean and the waitresses are very friendly. Did I mention you can't beat the price! An all around excellent place to stop if you are in the area and up for some great Chinese food! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Asian restaurant in town. The food is delicious and very affordable. The service is also very good. I've had no complaints every time I've eaten here. Their house egg foo yung, fried calamari, Mongolian beef, and Singapore rice noodles are to die for. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for the best Chinese food."}
{"text":"Just moved to Laveen.  Needed (ok, wanted) Chinese.  This place has great reviews so I drove there and got take out.  The beef and broccoli dinner came with rice, noodles, an eggroll, and two crab rangoons for around $9.  I found the beef and broccoli to be a little bit on the salty side but other than that everything was very good.  The lady at the counter was extremely friendly and was patient while I decided on what to eat.  They have a comfy little bar area where you can sit and wait for your food which was nice as well.  I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch and was expecting nothing much.    We got amazing service and wonderfully flavorful food.    I will say, as someone that lived in China for a summer, I am pretty critical when it comes to Chinese food.  This food is definitely Americanized but it hit the spot like nobody's business.   Plus, we didn't even do a happy hour or special and we still thought the food was decently priced.  Maybe because we just moved from Ahwatukee we're used to being ripped off.   Honestly, the front dining room is spotless and the waiters/waitresses are the most attentive (without being annoying) I've ever seen.  They're great."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my hubs for the first time. Small place, casual. The staff are very friendly,  and attentive. I had the shrimp chow mein, my husband had the shrimp fried rice. Both of which were good. The eggs rolls and egg drop soup both were good. Our food came hot, and the wait time wasn't bad. We will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way from Los Angeles to Tucson and found this great place on yelp. Best orange chicken ever! Glad we stopped! 5 minutes off of the freeway but worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend and mines favorite Chinese restaurant. The staff alone makes this place worth five stars. The food is delicious and is a great value for your money. They have dozens of beef, chicken, and shrimp options to choose from."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a good Chinese place near our house so we decided to try this place. I am glad we did, it was really tasty. We ordered pork fried rice, broccoli beef, sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken. They were all equally good. We especially loved the rice and lemon chicken. Everything was hot and fresh and authentic tasting. No fast food Chinese food here! The portions were big and the prices are very affordable. $35 for all the food we got plus 2 sodas. The service was great also very friendly. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"I Love this restaurant it is so delicious!  The people there are super nice. We always get Kung Pou chicken and broccoli and beef. We also get chicken fried rice and egg drop soup. We ordered our food and when we went to pick it up they let us know that they put in a free thing of egg drop soup because it was raining outside. We were very happy that they did that for their costumers. When we got home we thought it would be a little thing of egg drop soup and it was a huge thing of egg drop soup which was a surprise. Everything tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place everyday for the past year and never really gave it any thought.  Friday on my way home I was in the mood for Asian Cuisine so I stopped in and ordered some take out.  I ordered General Tso's Chicken.  When I got home I was pleased.  The Chicken was moist and had a very good flavor.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the rice.  It was a little dryer than I expected but still good.  I think I waited about 15 min to get my food since I didn't call ahead.  It seems to be a popular place; there were people coming to get their orders they called in and others walking in to have dinner.  The staff new the regular customers which made me feel that they appreciate their customers.  For the the amount of food and the quality I'm not going to be going to Panda anymore."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST food we've found in the southwest valley. The value is amazing, the food was all flavorful. I tried really, really hard to find a flaw; even the customer service was outstanding. It's about a 15-20 minute drive... I'd make it daily!!"}
{"text":"Best cheap Chinese food ever. The ladies are always amazing and helpful. Every time I order through the phone, they would always have everything ready by the time I get there. Even when I was early. It's definitely legit"}
{"text":"this place was ok...there sweet and sour chicken was really good....but have had better orange chicken especially when I'm from california...."}
{"text":"Very nice surprise in our neighborhood. Great size portions AND quality food, you usually only get one or the other. Super friendly and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food and the service is amazing! Every time I try something new because everything I have is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome service and delicious food. Highly recommend the honey walnut shrimp and the orange chicken. Honestly the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"There used to be a Chinese buffet down on Lower Buckeye.  One day, my lovely lady and I were craving some Asian cuisine in a big way.  Going strictly on memory, (which I'll admit is sometimes patchy EXCEPT when it comes to food) the place was quite delicious.  In fact it was the best Chinese buffet I had been to since I'd moved to Phoenix.  So we took a drive down the interstate to stop in for a visit.  Unfortunately, as fate is wont to have its way with Chinese buffets, this one had closed up.  I'm going to blame it on the Triads.  Thoroughly bummed out, we decided we may have to settle for something other than what we craved that day.  Heading back onto the interstate, however, we spied a sign which caught our attention.  Asian?  Seemed like the trip could be salvaged after all!  We were greeted with a cozy aura upon entering the front door.  The wait staff kindly informed us to choose our own seat.  We took a quick look through the menu and decided the best value would be the pick two dinners for $18.  We got Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken.  From order to eats there was a minimal amount of waiting.  The eggrolls were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, in other words, perfect.  The soup, though a little on the salty side, was flavorful.  The main course came out on four huge dishes.  I threw together a few spoonfuls of beef and chicken on a bed of rice and dug in.  The flavors were good.  They were much more nuanced than expected.  Normally I assume the food at a Chinese joint is going to be completely slathered in MSG but it was not the case.  The Kung Pao was my preference and although only slightly spicy it had a defining taste that wasn't just salt.  My favorite thing about the whole experience, in my opinion, was the fact that we had so much to take home.  Leftover Chinese at 3AM is always a good idea.  I plan on making regular trips back to this hidden gem now that i've discovered it.  It's great to know there is somewhere with decent Asian cuisine on the western end of the city.  If you live in the West Valley region and want a quality Asian meal at an affordable price, don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  They get it right.  Great food, great service, and great prices.  Food is always hot and crispy.  Server is always nice and helpful."}
{"text":"It's not very often that I give a place five stars.  Especially Chinese food.   I went around 1:30 pm on a Monday. The place was empty but this did not bother me.  I was greeted with positive warm smiles asking if I would like to be seated or if my order was to go.   I got my order to go and I was out the door within 10-15 minutes,  again no complaints,  the food is worth the wait!!   I'm a big calamari junkie, with that being said I have had my fair share of calamari experience around the world,  good and bad.  This place has instantly made it to my top five favorite calamari places.  It was different from what I was used to but it still made the list.  The calarmi rings came lightly fried and breaded,  with sprinkles of jalapeño, onions,  and carrots,  and to my surprise - - octopus.  I was a tad thrown off but I'm very open minded and whoooa,  it was delicious.    I also like potstickers, I got an order of six and unfortunately one ended up in my mouth before I took a picture!  They look deeply fried,  but they definitely don't taste like it.  Call me picky,  but there is a thing called too deep fried.  I will be getting these again for sure.    Chicken chow mein,  I'm also a noodle freak.  I love my chow mein,  lo mein, suey, and so on so forth.  If you're looking for panda express chow mein,  don't order this,  because you'll surely be disappointed!  This style of chow mein was not heavily sauced,  which is what I prefer,  but at the same time it was extremely flavorful and delicious.    I'm sure you are tired of reading at this point,  but you can't tell me I didn't tell you about the orange chicken lunch special!   Crab puff - yum.  Wish I got more.   Egg roll-eh didn't care much for it.  It was like a spring roll with the egg roll stuffings.  My taste buds were confused.  Orange chicken - yum yum yum.  You can definitely tell that it is house made.  (or home made for you newbies)  which made it even more phenomenal!   If you get a chance,  go here.  You'll fall in love and leave panda express in the dust!!"}
{"text":"They have the best chow mein, my kids love their orange chicken. Can't beat their lunch combos. Their waitress is also very friendly, she has been working there for the past 5 years that I have been coming here. They have the best homemade hot sauce but you have to ask for it, only reason why I know is because I saw it on their little cooler sitting by the register while waiting for food."}
{"text":"If you've ever seen the new GhostBusters, you've seen the part where the wonton soup comes with only one dumpling, and then way too many dumplings. Well....this soup is so perfect, I imagine that Melissa McCarthy would be ecstatic. There are vegetables and chicken and shrimp and dumplings all perfectly floating with the perfect amount of space, in a perfectly salted broth.   I am happy.   Oh and everything else on the menu is amazing. My favorites are cashew chicken, fried rice, chicken and snow peas, and sesame chicken. I usually order  enough for a couple of days, and it all reheats really well."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, friendly and cheap. What else could you ask for?! Heating up left overs now."}
{"text":"Great people and even better food. My wife and I go there go there every other week even though we are afraid the staff will start recognizing us and our bad eating habits. Best place in the tolleson laveen area  UPDATE!!!!  We stopped by here again and the waitress already knew what I was going to order. I am now deeply ashamed but my hungryness levels are higher than my dignity so I will continue to go."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, this place is awesome! Oh and reasonably priced for lunch AND dinner! I had the curry chicken dinner combo, added a cup of egg flower soup which came out at the perfect temperature, hot but not scalding hot. Everything was delicious and scrumptious, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had this for dinner last night. Husband and I shared a sweet and sour chicken combo. My son got the beef chow mein. We also got the pork fried rice. Oh my goodness the pork fried rice was so good. The whole meal was great. Love the egg rolls. The fried rice that comes with the combo is okay and not great but we eat it. It could use some vegetables."}
{"text":"Food Was Excellent and As For The Service I Give Them Two Thumbs Up...Keep Doing Your Thing...Best Chinese In Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small neighborhood restaurant with consistently good food and service. Sort of like a hole-in-the wall restaurant but it's clean and the food is actually good. The traditional dishes including fried rice, orange chicken, and chow mein are tasty and fresh. My favorite is the vegetable chow mein with tofu and double cooked pork. If you get the cravings for chinese food, there's a panda express down the road but unlike panda express, this place is not fast food, and it is prepared when you order. When you're in the area, this is a great place to have a nice meal while watching their flat screen T.V. .Or I guess you could actually talk to whomever you're with."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly, the place clean and the food is well priced for what you get.  No, it is not super fancy.  It is filling, fresh and always tasty.  Love this neighborhood joint.  Glad to see they are here to stay!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is very sub par. Waited 10 mins to get order in then another 30 minutes for food. A former employee who worked here made coming here pleasant. The older lady and young guy need better customer service.  ***update***  Food was very sub par as well."}
{"text":"Our go to Chinese food place near our house. Fast, friendly and clean. Take out or dine in its always good."}
{"text":"Quick service is what they serve in the place. They have great food...but in my opinion just a little overpriced, but then again...I feel like most Asian restaurants are in AZ. The waiter is super friendly and always has a smile on her face.  One thing to keep in mind...if you take any food to-go...and they put the food in this black plastic container...well...even though it says it's micro safe...it's not! Mine melted in the microwave...not cool at all!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh as far as i can tell although the chow mein could use some flavor.  Overall not gonna disappoint for what you're going to get in Arizona."}
{"text":"Love it !!!!! I was here mostly for the egg drop soup , I was craving it ! It is delicious!!  I give it a 4 star because I need to try more foods in this place."}
{"text":"Great size portions when you eat in my favorite is Mongolian beef and shrimp chop suey"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Asian cuisine around.  The service is friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"So glad I doing this place , I had the Singapore rice noodles and the sweet and sour delight both where great , and mind you full plates one was 8.95 and the other 7.95 wow under 10 bucks , food came out hot and tasted great. I really loved the staff very funny and talkative. Definitely will come back !!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not super fantastic or anything. I tried this place since there were so many good reviews. Apparently when ordering \"Pepper Chicken\", you have to specify if you want Chicken with Green Peppers in it, OR Chicken with Black Pepper in it. Hmmmm okay.... despite the mix up, the service was excellent. Would I come back? Probably not. I guess we have a better spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here the food has been unbelievably delicious and fresh. I highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I like the dinner special for 2. Orange chicken is the best. I have yet to try all the other dishes, friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chinese food we have tried.  My mother ordered the egg foo young which was just a soy patty with nothing mix in.   The noodles were soggy and sticky and the fried rice was very bland,  in fact everything was very bland. The only thing that was edible was the beef and broccoli because of the green onions. The egg rolls were burnt and even their fortune cookies sucked.  I don't understand why this place has a 4 star rating.  We will NEVER go back again.."}
{"text":"Wow! Really good food and great service. Everything was freshly prepared. We went in for lunch. I had orange chicken and my husband had Mongolian beef. Both specials came with soup, fried rice, a crab wonton and a spring roll. We each had iced tea. The bill came to $16.80. The food was fantastic and the staff was friendly. The place isn't very large and it was pretty busy while we were there. The staff seemed to know their customers so it looks like they get a lot of return business. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I'm very picky with the Chinese food that I eat but this place really hit the spot. First of all, the place is very clean! The people were very helpful. The portions are a great size compared to many places with the prices being very fair. Love that it's down the street from my home cause I'll definitely be coming back!"}
