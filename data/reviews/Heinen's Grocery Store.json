{"text":"I'm in heaven!  Small store!!! Love it.  I don't need to walk down a 20 foot aisle of cereal.  THANK YOU.  It's compact, has it all and I don't spend all day in there!!! Hellooooo!!!"}
{"text":"YES!  Finally a store down town.  Love it!  Friendly staff.  Great selection of take out.  Love the wine tasings/fast order food bar!  AWESOME!  The only thing subpar is the parking.  They've changed the parking configuration and it's the pitts!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. You must go here. I ordered two fish tacos yesterday and they were outstandingly delicious--fresh, flavorful, lime wedges provided on the side. It was $8 and it was the best meal I've had all week probably. I also enjoyed tasting two wines--one a Riesling, the other a Rose--at the wine stations they have in this store. The service is second-to-none. The people who work here are the best. Go immediately, I implore."}
{"text":"What a beautiful store. I stopped in briefly to look at the beer and wine. They actually have the wine available to taste(cost) from a dispenser. It's nice to try before you buy"}
