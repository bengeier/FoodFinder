{"text":"I was a little bit nervous when I first walked in because it was 7 o'clock and the restaurant was empty. My fears however were completely unfounded as the food was delicious, in fact the best Thai food I've had in my 15 years living in Toronto. The price is incredibly reasonable, and the portions large. To the people who are complaining about overcooked noodles when getting takeout, what exactly do you expect? They cook the food and then it sits in a container with steam coming off of it for the next 20-30 minutes until you get home. There's nothing a chef can do to prevent that, some food just isn't meant to be taken to go and Thai noodles are one of them."}
{"text":"I just read the review below about the decor, and disagree.

I understand that comfort is important, but it actually feels like a place you would walk into in any part of Thailand, especially with the large portraits of the King and Queen - a sure sign that the place is Thai owned and operated.
I find there are far too many locations across the GTA that are trying to attract the 'fusion' crowd of diners who want the clean and modern atmosphere like EAST downtown on Queen St. West.  Often, these places employ Chinese chefs so the dishes really aren't authentic, yet looks and feels like it could be by their decor and presentation.

Give me a wood chair, tacky Thai paintings or sculptures any day, because I know I will be able to trust the food.  And do they ever hit the mark.

Portions are great, and there's usually lots to bring home - and the flavours hit it every time.  Often, Pad Thai is far too saucy and red - a sign the chef has used incorrect ingredients.  It should be light, fresh, and crisp, rather than a soupy mess of over-cooked ingredients - and I think Baan Thai has one of the best pad thais in the city.

There is a spicy and crispy beef dish (that I cannot remember the name of) that is an absolute dream.  
And, when it comes to service, you can't get better from the Thais who own the place.

Definitely recommended, because they're smiling continuously, and seemingly proud to offer Toronto their very best."}
{"text":"Awesome food.I had pad see ew , chicken satay and thai tea,I really love it.the place is asmosphere and good service"}
{"text":"Here's what happened at Baan Thai tonight:

My wife ordered a glass of wine with our meal.  After one taste she asked me if I thought it was off.  It definitely was - it smelt like vinegar and was very warm.  We very politely mentioned this to the server, and after one small sip each, asked her to take it away.  

However, at the end of the meal, we noticed the charge was not removed.  When I asked the server about it, she was very awkward and said there was nothing she could do because her manager said to leave it on.  When I spoke with the manager he was obstinate and would not remove the charge because \"we ordered it\".

We've been here several times and have put up with the awkward service, inconsistent portion sizes, and fluctuating prices, but after tonight, I am never returning!

With so many incredible ethnic restaurant in the area (Silk, Curry Twist, North of Bombay, Friendly Thai) there is absolutely no reason to waste your time here."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's fast, it's a lot of food per portion and it tastes AMAZING! ( I can only speak for their green thai curry and the pad thai though)
And they are always friendly in there (don't speak much, but always take your order with a smile, at least when we go in there)

And their green curry is just ... delicious!

(Don't try delivery! Their website says they deliver, but they actually don't.)"}
{"text":"So, in general, if you're going for a particular ethnic fare; it's good if the place is owned and run by that particular ethnicity.  Baan Thai is owned and run by, you guessed it, Thai folks!  And thank goodness for that because I've  finally been able to get a great papaya salad in this city!  Woohoo!

The food is great and the portions are good and the price is good.  The joint is a little out of the way in the Junction but it was definitely worth the trek from my safe Little Italy haven.  

They have a great selection of Thai salads such as papaya salad (woohoo!) and Laab (minced flavoured meat, another of my faves) and you can order it with sticky rice and eat it in true Thai fashion.  Go with a few people and order a few dishes to share and look at all their Thai decor; including pictures of the royal family -- which any good Thai restaurant should have.  And try their papaya salad -- woohoo!"}
{"text":"Delicious peanut curry, good prices."}
{"text":"Thai food was pretty good here. We didn't try any of their American foods. It was flavorful and the service is really nice. The restaurant is pretty quiet because it is upstairs and there isn't a lot of foot traffic. Enjoyed the Thai sausages very much and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Finally found a solid Thai delivery spot! The food is delicious! The receptionist and delivery driver were extremely polite. Since moving to Summerlin I have ordered from countless Thai restaurants and often found the food to be bland or down right terrible. I was on the verge of giving up on Thai delivery when i happened across Baan Thai. The pad Thai was delish, the yellow curry though ...was seriously amazing... so good that I just ordered it for lunch after having it for dinner last night. Whoever they have in the kitchen deserves an extra star because the food is flavorful and nuanced. Looking forward to trying more menu items over time and strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried the peanut curry (panang curry) the first time we ordered take out from there and it was the best curry I have ever had in Toronto. I can't wait to go back! The food was ready quickly and everyone was thrilled with what they ordered."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my friends and the food was very good. We ordered the papaya salad was very tasty. The tom yum soup was probably my favorite. The customer service is very nice. Our server was nice and friendly. I recommend this place for someone who wants to impress there friends with thai food."}
{"text":"My friends and I dropped in late at night and still had a spectacular experience here. The ambience was nice and staff was really friendly. Our table was overly impressed with the fresh fruit-infused water (so good!!) which was refilled often and right on time. Our food was delicious with beautiful presentation. It was exactly what I needed after a long day. Thank you! I'll return the next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"I went with girlfriends to this restaurant fir the first time over the weekend.  We ordered the usual - Pad Thai, red curry chicken, egg rolls and chicken larb.  Everything was tasty.  The place also has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I came here for only the Pad Thai, and I was SEVERELY disappointed!

I sat waiting in anticipation for my takeout order next to another individual who also got the Pad Thai; his veggie, mine shrimp.

I get home to find the OVERCOOKED noodles are tasty (I'll give 'em that) though quite sloppy and mushy, but it seems they simply gave me half of a veggie Pad Thai order, theN threw in 5 freezer burned, tasteless, over cooked (I think they're actually making me ill) shrimp without cooking it with the sauce and then charged me $3 extra for that garbage... sorry, the shrimp were garbage, I'm not exaggerating.

Disappointing.

I can't speak for the rest of the menu though, too bad about this experience, I will never return."}
{"text":"Their Curry, Their Fried Rice, Pad Thai, Thai tea is all amazing. This is my favorite, go to Thai place. I've gone there so many times and Baan Thai has never let me down, or messed up on a order (I'm a vegetarian). So glad I found this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I came here again with my boyfriend a couple of weeks later, and our lunch and service was subpar. It took the waiter a long time to give us our water refills, and our egg drop soup was cold and undercooked. Our curry dishes that we ordered were pretty ok, but the potatoes inside the curry were really undercooked. I think they have a new chef in the kitchen or something. I found this experience odd because all the other times I've eaten here, the service and food were on point; hopefully they make the necessary changes and come back to their former glory."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch before our flight. Unfortunately, there are only a few Thai dishes on the menu, most are what you would find at a Chinese restaurant. The food was good, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Staff is super sweet, food is AMAZING seriously me and my bf could not believe it! Vegan menu did not disappoint!!! Love the onion rings and veggie chow mien :) they also have vegan desserts like mochi and mango sticky rice. I would seriously recommend this place."}
{"text":"Having a girls night out with my BFF and couldn't have picked a better choice for a new restaurant. Healthy portions and taste that don't disappoint. If you like crab, you must go for the crab fried rice but the Rad Nah was my favorite. I did vegetarian but you can add any protein you want. Garlic salmon was a little dry but lots of choices on the menu. Huge Thai icetea was great with chicken satay appetizer. Now I'm waiting on my mango sticky fried rice for dessert and can't wait. A MUST try for Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"I stopped here only by chance...we were hungry.  Everything I ordered was delicious.  Had papaya salad lao style, chicken green curry, and Tom kah soup.   I'm surprised to find this place not packed/busy on a Saturday night not far off the Vegas strip.  Highly recommend.  I'll also stop by again whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Food was great.. good customer service and really clean good smelling bathroom..  I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service the pad Thai was the best!! Pierre was a great waitress.will go back again"}
{"text":"Meh.  Got delivery and it was pretty bad.  Soggy egg rolls and stinky pad Thai.  On a scale of 1-10 it was 0 for spicy."}
{"text":"Stay away. NO flavor to the spring rolls, Pad Thai was gummy and tasteless. No alcohol."}
{"text":"This place was a small but cozy restaurant. Staff was really nice and helpful. The food was delicious. Is it the best Thai restaurant? No but it wasn't bad at all. The food was good. We started off with the appetizers. Golden tofu with a chili sauce. The tofu was deep fried a little too long for my liking. The edamame had a little bit too much salt on it for me. The Tom kha soup was delicious though. Plenty of vegetables and flavorful. The main entree was grilled salmon with a mango salad which was very delicious. Each bite made me feel so happy! The combination went together so well. A plus for this place is that they have a vegan menu also. My daughter who happens to be a vegan absolutely loved her entree. Would I go back? Yes I think I would. Would I recommend this place? Yes again."}
{"text":"Very good one of my favorites this is my 2nd time here and i am still very pleased everything is so fresh and flavors are all on point. It is so hard to find good Thai food in Vegas but this is it"}
{"text":"I order basil fried rice,  the taste is was't  like thai food. I had thai food for my whole life. I went to many thai restaurant, I never saw they put egg and pea inside spicy basil fried rice at all. Plus in their regular menu wasn't  Tell me ingredients has pea and egg with it.  I'm disappointed so bad. I will never comeback."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a hiding gem.  We stopped by for lunch and it was our first time to try out Baan Thai Restaurant.  They have great deal on lunch menu.  For $7.50 you get the whole meal with soup and an egg roll.  The quality is above our expectations for the price we paid.  We ordered the Satay Chicken for the Apps, the Thai Mint Chicken lunch deal and the Tom Yum soup. The soup was ok, needs for veggies and meat.  All other dishes were amazing.  Will definitely coming back to Baan Thai.  If you're in the area, must check it out!! My words against yours :)."}
{"text":"One of the nicest thai restaurant here in las vegas. Perfect to bring your date or best friend. Very clean and quiet place."}
{"text":"We ordered food through a mobile app and it was amazing !! We got pad see ew chicken chow Leon and Tom Kah soup and everything was so amazing and flavorful I don't know much about the spot inside but the customer service from picking up our order was good the lady was really kind . We really wanted to try the green tea crepe but they didn't have it so we had the mango sticky rice and it was by far the best I have ever tried the mango was so sweet and fresh . I loved it ! Good food ! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was really good the place itself is nice for date night. We ordered the regular Pad Thai level 1 because my fiancé doesn't eat much spice . I got the Pad See Ew level 3 , it was bomb! Couldn't skip dessert finished with the sticky rice w/mango and sweet Roti!"}
{"text":"Craving for Thai BBQ chicken...unfortunately this place doesn't have it on the menu
So I ordered Pad Woon Sen and Chicken Curry...
Very clean place...empty
Good place for vegans"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick. Faster than what it said. The burger was yummy and the meat is thick af. The delivery guy was chill. There was a thick piece of onion though lol"}
{"text":"OMG ordered thru the Eat24 App and I have to say this is some of the worst food I've ever received. We pitched most of it. 

Food was not hot and just not good--bland and generic. It was so bad that I asked Eat24 for a refund which surprisingly they did. AVOID DELIVERY FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"Want to check out this place since there's a Thai food place in Chinatown and since my love for Thai food is never ending. It's located on the second floor in SF supermarket building next to the Veggie house. (Map quest place the location in the middle of the street for some reason..) 

Because we didn't had time to eat there we ordered Duck curry, Pad See Ew w/ chicken, Pineapple fried rice and Garlic lover w/ fried tofu, all to go. And OHMYGOD the food is soooo good! I saw couple of reviews were they said pas see ew was lacking veggies actually it was fine for me. They had so much meat in all the dishes as well.  Their spicy level rate from 1-5 and everything we ordered were spicy no#3 except for garlic lover w/ tofu, which was none spicy. But I think I'm going spicy no#4 or 5 next time because spicy no#3 level was not spicy for me. Then again I eat spicy food every day so it's nothing for me, so I suggest if you are new to Thai food or first time going to eat at Baan go with a lower spicy level so that way you know what level it is that you are comfortable with. (Because every Thai food place differ in spicy level) 

My sister was the one who went to pick the food and the first thing she told me was \"this place is so clean you can eat off the floor so I think this is an awesome restaurant.\" She also said the hostess was super nice and was all smile the entire time she was there. Which is a plus in my book! Plus they offer Vegan food too!!! 

Overall super glad there's a Thai food place in Chinatown where there's easy access to park, get the food and not pricy. Also the fact the food is really good! So going back there... a lot!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was awesome and the ambiance was very comfortable. The service was also good. Very attentive and cordial. I will go back to this place"}
{"text":"Appetizers 5/5
Entree's 4/5
Service 5/5
Thai coffee 5/5
Desserts 4/5

Family lunch at Baan Thai today. Nice experience, kind of hard to seat 6 people but they accommodated quickly. We ordered family style and enjoyed a wide variety of appetizers and entree's. We ordered waters all around a Thai coffee, which was exceptionally good.

For appetizers we tried the chicken satay 5/5, fish cakes 5/5, papaya salad spicy 2, was very spicy for a 2 out of 5 but still quite enjoyable 4/5 and lastly he Tom kha soup with shrimp 4/5. Over the appetizers were very good and plenty for a large party.

Entree's came out quickly which was nice. We ordered a lot and enjoyed sharing; including pad si ew beef 2/5 beef was very hard, pad si ew chicken spicy 5 a delicious 5/5, crab fried rice which came with plenty of crab meat 5/5, yellow curry with chicken and added bamboo 4/5 and lastly the drunken noodle with fried tofu 4/5 spicy 3. With the wide variety even though some entree's weren't great we all enjoyed the variety and different flavors.

For dessert we tried the sticky rice with mango 5/5 and the sweet roti 4/5. I would have given the roti a better rating but after having authentic roti at the Thai temple in Las Vegas its hard to beat.

Thank you Baan Thai for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"While Baan Thai is only getting a 3 star rating from me, that's not necessarily a bad thing. 3 stars is solid, maybe once I have more food from here I'll bump it up a notch.

Didn't head inside, take-out only this time, but got a variety of dishes to test out the basics of Thai cuisine.(And also, my favourite dishes at Thai restaurants!)

Ginger Tofu, Panang Curry and Pad See Ew. All relatively cheap, all fairly good portions and the order was completed in 15 minutes during dinner time on a Monday evening! What could go wrong?

Well, nothing was wrong, but I wasn't totally blown out of the water, there's a lot of competition in Thai food these days. The Pad See Ew was nice and savoury but on the bland side, no spice whatsoever, and the Ginger Tofu was more sweet ginger, also no spice, and a bit watery.

So imagine my surprise when the Panang Curry punched me in the face and demanded to be taken seriously! That curry was a monster! I was thoroughly impressed with that dish and will definitely be trying the red and yellows next time.

Here's to a possible star bump in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"This place blew our vegan minds tonight.

I swore off yellow curries, as I either couldn't guarantee their vegan-ness (see my review on Weera  after ~5yrs of eating there!) or I just was disappointed. It has been so long since I could enjoy one.
Well, tonight's yellow curry was ridiculously above & beyond amazing....We also got red curry, which was decidedly amazing. They both had a lovely presentation. And they actually were spicy, as we  requested. I hate when places judge.

The orange tofu was unique & excellent, really fresh tasting. It didn't taste too sweet or too breaded or too processed. I've never had another like it. It wasn't just fried cubes or frozen fake chicken.

And I can't believe I'm saying this, but even the jasmine rice was extra delicious, and we are snobs &  eat Thai food on the reg."}
{"text":"Decent stuff. Pad Thai was average. Green curry was pretty awesome. Attentive service, food came pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot believe all of the 5 stars reviews, this is by far the worst Thai food I've ever had (Delivery). Not sure if Dine in experience is better or not but I'm unwilling to take the chance. Beware the delivery fee is $9. I ordered the Pad Thai, Spring rolls and Mango & Sticky Rice. The Pad Thai had absolutely no flavor. I opened the foil and to my surprise the food was still hot (Pad Thai only, I had to reheat spring rolls). The delivery was over an hour so I'm assuming that's why my spring rolls were barely lukewarm once I received them. Back to the Pad Thai, no flavor. I had to add salt to even tolerate it. I didn't even finish half the dish before tossing it. The spring rolls are not authentic Thai spring rolls. They were mushy lacking in flavor and vegetables. They clearly weren't fried long enough as there was no crunch to the rolls. They were just plain disgusting, a compete waste of $5. The only barely tolerable part of my overpriced $40+ meal was the mango and sticky rice. The sauce wasn't what I was used to but it was decent. Not sure why they put cherries on top, it's not the right garnishing or flavor. Nothing should outshine the mango, and the cherry just made everything taste weird, so I tried to eat around them. Again not something that Thai restaurants do with this dish. The food is probably better at the restaurant but even still, delivery shouldn't be this bad. Huge disappointment. The reviews must be from employees or friends of the owners because what I got was pathetic."}
{"text":"Delivery was pretty quick.

Food was okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered yellow curry , and fried shrimp. 
The curry itself was very good, velvety smooth texture and flavored nicely. 
The vegetables and chicken were sad.
Potatoes were hard, a few pieces of chicken were distasteful as if it was day old, and maybe there were 2 slices of carrot.
If the chicken had been fresh and plentiful with beautiful vegetables this plate would have been outstanding. 
When I saw fried shrimp, I thought plump , sweet, crunchy battered shrimp, because menu did not say breaded shrimp.
They were flat breaded , probably Costco 
boxed shrimp.
I might give this restaurant a 2nd try because it was clean. I would try something completely different.Service was not outstanding but ok."}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly awesome. I'd give this place 4 stars, 3 solid stars for the food and an extra one because I was not expecting it. While running errands with my husband, we accidently found this place.  Our servers were teenage children of the restaurant owners, I assume.  I have a soft spot for family businesses.  
My pad thai was just right.  I didn't get overly thirsty like I do at so many aweful asian restaurants in Toronto (that use too much fake flavoring). The table seated next to us kept raving about their mango salad.  I wished we weren't trying to be good to our waistline and just ordered more than what we could finish.  I can't remember which curry my husband got but it too was delicous.  You can definitely tell that the cooks were Thai, the flavours tasted authentic and not like the Knorr packages you find at most non-Thai owned places. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"Large portions of excellent authentic Thai food. Best Thai beef jerky I've ever had. Eight large shrimps in the fried rice! The pork and asparagus dish was superb. Look out, they like it hot!"}
{"text":"So I ordered the Panang curry off of Uber eats and clicked the no spicy option as well as wrote down PLEASE NO SPICY in the notes and even called them before they cooked it and told them I don't want it spicy. Keep in mind I have a high tolerance to spicy food, when my food arrived it was so spicy I couldn't eat it. Literally had to throw it away because it was so bad. I called afterwards and the lady on the phone had the audacity to tell me to try a different Thai restaurant next time. I wouldn't be so angry if she told me it was still spicy when I called beforehand. Biggest waste of $47 in my life. Will never return worst customer service I've experienced at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service but food was meh. Ordered through app and was ready quickly. But really nothing special."}
{"text":"First off, WOW! I have to say it was THE BEST VEGAN THAI FOOD I have ever had. You can really taste the freshness in their dishes, not only that, they have a huge selection of vegan dishes to choose from. Also, the restaurant is absolutely GORGEOUS. Service was AMAZING. Prices are great, I can't stress it enough by how satisfied I was upon leaving. Definitely making Baan Thai my favorite Thai restaurant. A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Mozzerella sticks. Red curry. Caprese salad. While this nice little Thai restaurant's menu appears to have an identity crisis, it's definitely worth trying if you like Thai food! 

I stopped in to pick up just a Thai tea and a sticky mango rice, and the quality and presentation on everything was so truly nice- even on a to-go order! Every bite of mango sticky rice was delicious, and they even wrapped my tea up in a tiny little half-sized bag that has a handle on it. 

Would definitely come back since they've demonstrated great attention-to-detail in their orders."}
{"text":"the food is very good ?plesae try the pineapple fri rice with shimp?tom yum kong soup?fish cake ?pad see ew?my favorites!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and a good place is awesome. Been here for lunch now several times, always great food, great service, and an awesome lunch special. Took some friends here as well which made it all the better to here food things from them also. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I only had yellow curry with chicken but, it was crazy good!  The restaurant was tidy and seemed very organized.  It's located in a crammed two-story strip mall but, I was able to find parking easily."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant.  #3 spicy is perfect, and the infused water was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food located in the infamous busy Chinatown. I decided on giving Baan Thai Restaurant a try when I was invited out to lunch with one of my business clients. Prior to yesterday's experience it had been a while since I had went out for a good Thai lunch.

When we arrived, it was a bit confusing to find this place as they are located in a shopping center with several other businesses. If you are counting on a GPS to get you here, it will tell you that you have arrived as soon as you get into the parking lot which yeah in a sense you have but not all the way. After looking all around and up and down standing from the bottom of the parking lot. We spotted Baan Thai on the 2nd level. Basically right in the middle of the shops at the top.

Once we walked In, there was nobody in the place. I thought for a moment maybe they were closed and forgot to lock the door? I don't know.. Anyways finally this man comes from the back and greets us and welcomes us to sit wherever we would like. I began to wonder though slightly to myself why it was lunch time and nobody was there. In the faith of the number of star ratings I had previously seen that they have earned I still decided to stay. Now lunch time was over at 3:00 PM so we had plenty of time to still take advantage of the lunch hour prices on the menu.

After browsing the condensed version of the regular menu (lunch). I actually ended up ordering off of the regular menu because there really wasn't anything that peaked any interest for my taste buds. The food ordered for this visit was as followed:

Baan Thai Fish Cakes: Deep fried mini fish cake squares. Served with sweet chili, cucumber crushed peanuts.

Teriyaki Chicken

Combination(Chicken/Shrimp/Beef) Pad Thai: Rice noodle pan-fried with eggs, bean sprouts, green onions, tamarind sauce, and ground peanut.

Thai Iced Tea with Boba

Overall, everything was just okay. Service was good. I mean maybe I visited on a day where things were just OK because I'm seeing all these 5-star rating and kind of got my hopes up... Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible however it wasn't great. I've had better.. Working close to the area I will give them another try in the near future."}
{"text":"My mom and I have started coming here every time we vacation in Vegas.  The food is just as great as last year, and we will definitely be coming back.  I love the vegetarian menu and always looking forward to coming here.
It is a little out of the way from the strip but completely worth it"}
{"text":"This place was NOT good. My husband and I ordered the Beef Pad Thai and it came with very little meat -as did all the meat entrees. Also the beef was very tough and tasted as though the meat were boiled. We also got Kung Pao Chicken and Basil chicken. The kung pao chicken was full of liquid, they put cabbage in it and it was swimming with veggies in liquid with a few pieces of chicken. It also had a fishy taste to it. The Basil chicken had a very weird flavor I couldn't put my finger on and had a very overwhelming scent to it. I spent $50 at this place and was not satisfied with the flavor, quantity or quality. For their prices the meat should be a nice cut, fresh flavors and not swimming in a bowl or sauce. I do not recommend this restaurant. Very disappointing because I am always looking for a good Thai restaurant. This is not it!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food first before my party of total 5. While everyone was enjoying their food I was sitting here and had to remind Them about 10 mins later what my order was. So I'll probably receive it while everyone else it done. That is very unprofessional and I will not be returning. Bad customer service. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best faux chicken I've had in a while. Definitely delicious and flavorful and the texture is ON POINT for vegan chicken. I would not recommend the boba however, which was hard and stuff. Not chewy at all. However, service was really great and the other dishes, including the tofu, was really delicious. Great option for vegas in the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"I went to Vegas on vacation and got to try this Thai place out. Seriously the best Thai food I have ever tried. The Pad Thai is just a 10/10. Also Tom Yum soup is the bomb dot come. It was to good I had Pad Thai two days in a row. Haha."}
{"text":"We went to this mall and noticed that there is a new Thai restaurant that just opened. Just wanna support local Thai business, because I travel around the States.

After I talked to a nice server asking for food suggestions, we got three dishes that is really authentic Thai flavor. They are crab fried rice, rad nah noodle, and bean thread salad (Yum Woonsen).  They are all huge portion that three of us could not finish them.

We definitely come back here if we have to visit Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Great thai food in Chinatown.

We came in for dinner after searching on yelp. The place is very clean and the decorations on the walls and inside the place are neat, including the flower vase and the placemats on each table. There are tv screens as well.

We had egg rolls, tom yum soup with seafood, pad thai with chicken, pad kee mao with pork, and basil fried rice with shrimp. We chose the medium 2~3 spice level.

The eggrolls were golden, crispy, and served with sweet and sour sauce. 
The tom yum soup was very good. 
Pad thai was one of the best I've had. 
Pad kee mao had good flavor.
I could taste the strong flavor of the basil, house special sauce in the basil fried rice.
Each dish did not skimp on the protein nor the vegetables.

Portions were pretty big, we got to share all the dishes. Prices are reasonable. Service was prompt, server came to check on us, and refilled our water.

Will come back."}
{"text":"Peanut curry was incredibly flavorful and perfectly spiced.  The ginger beef was delicious too.  You could actually taste the ginger; unlike other places I've been.  

I've been coming here for years and love the authentic favors and decor.  

It's not fancy so dont let the decor fool you.  This place has great eats"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered a tom kha soup mushrooms are old and not washed properly. The spicy flavor on the soup was good and tofu in the soup was also cooked well. Broccoli beef was covered in so much sauce it was very overwhelming. The beef texture was fine just way too much sauce super salty and fried rice had no flavor. Restaurant inside looks clean but it looks like they need to get better quality vegetables and wash them thoroughly. Server did take the vegetable delight entree off the check since we did not touch it too much sauce it was all swimming in sauce. They did apologize I hope they fix it."}
{"text":"Re-ordered the pad thai and it was not nearly as good as the first time- inconsistent. The curries though, which we've ordered multiple times now, are always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! One of our favorites and we eat Thai food a lot. Friendly staff and clean place. 
Recommend Drunken noodles and Pad See Ew"}
{"text":"Good service! tasty food.. highly recommended this place..  i like pineapple fried rice most.YUM YUM YUM!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place yesterday evening, as we have been trying different types of cuisine available in the junction and both thought \"hey, why not Thai?\"

The inner décor is not fancy and very homelike. On a weekday evening, the restaurant was relatively empty but this allowed for prompt service and a relaxed atmosphere. They do appear to have a problem with their stereo as all evening their music was skipping and at times it was relatively distracting.

My friend and I decided to order a combo for two, as it allowed us to try four different menu options at a reasonable $12/person. Each dish was flavourful and very mild for my timid tastebuds. Of the four, the two dishes that really stood out was their chicken fried rice, which had loads of fresh vegetables and juicy white meat, and their mango salad which had the perfect blend of sweetness which a tiny touch of heat. The other two dishes: spring rolls and the cashew chicken were not terrible by any means, they just didn't stand out in my opinion. Their drink menu offers both North American and Thailand favorites.

Servers were friendly and prompt. Atmosphere was relaxing. It provided a very homelike environment especially with staff sitting in another room skyping with friends on a laptop. After our meal, we were looking at the articles posted in their window when two strangers past by recommending the food, especially the Pad Thai (which would have been my other choice had we not sprung for the combo).

All in all, this place appears to be authentic in every regard. I would definitely recommend trying this place by either dining in or getting take out. It will definitely be on my radar next time I'm looking for a place to dine in the junction."}
{"text":"We placed a large take-out order to cater a party.  Ordering was a little tricky due to language barriers, but hey, it's authentic and indie.  When I arrived on a semi-busy Saturday night to pick it up, the single employee (owner?) in the front end painstakingly (and time-consumingly) checked that we had everything we ordered (while the rest of the neglected restaurant glared at us incredulously).  She was even kind enough to help me take it to my car (to the added consternation of those left inside).  

As for the food, \"meh\" says it all.  Pad Thais were soggy lumps of noodles with almost no veggies/protein/flavour.  The curry dishes were OK.  The so-called calamari tasted like Chinese take-out style deep fried mystery meat, replete with that neon-red sickly sweet and sour sauce. 

Maybe the eat-in experience is better than take-out, although I'd make sure it's not understaffed before taking a seat."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I had Thai food and since I was in Chinatown for some theatre tickets, I stopped here for lunch.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Pacific Asian Plaza and was formerly the site of the Three Villages Chinese Restaurant.  Take the elevator in the middle of the plaza and it will leave you right near their entrance.

I was greeted quickly and seated in the quiet place.  There were only a few other diners and the TV playing ESPN was in mute mode with closed captions so it was a very pleasant interior.

There are about 10 lunch specials all $7.50.  You get a cup of egg drop soup, an egg roll, rice, and the dish of your choice.  After ordering a Thai iced tea, I ordered the Thai mint chicken.  Their spiciness level is on a scale of 1 to 5 and I went with 4.  I was soon brought the soup which was standard.  It was just lukewarm.  It could have been much hotter temperature wise. The cup was just a bit more than half full. 

The mint chicken was nicely done and the spice level of 4 was good for me.  Altogether, lunch was filling and tasty but nothing special.  My server was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I found this place by chance and it's become one of my favorite places. Servers are friendly and the service is quick. The pad Thai is so good and never disappoints. The pineapple fried rice is also a great choice. Also recommend the Thai iced tea. The portions are large so I usually bring leftovers home to snack on later. Great place and I definitely recommend if you are looking for good Thai food."}
{"text":"Very consistant food with always an outstanding service. I was around and stop by for lunch and they have a $8 lunch special.  I am lucky the can change the menu to any soy protein. 3 friends were in the area and join me. Always a pleasure to eat here."}
{"text":"Great service great food. We had the vegetarian egg roll and Tom Khi soup with vegetarian soy was awesome, and soup presentation was quite unique and fascinating. The veggie Eggrolls were also crispy and delicious. I would highly recommend this place to anybody including vegans they are very vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"I am liking the newly expanded all vegan menu!!!

This spot has great service. Food is fresh and staff is happy to accommodate all my substitutions :)

Orange Tofu here is the best :)"}
{"text":"First time eating from here. Delivery was 20 minutes past what time Grubhub states. Thai ice tea is OK. Portions are small. Cheese cake is a HUGE rip off. Tiny slice. Egg rolls were soggy. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Quite good Thai food at very reasonable prices.  The yum woon sen was exceptional.  Very friendly service.

I am normally not swayed by a place's decor, but this place needs some work to make it look more appealing to customers and have them take away a better memory of their meals.  It definitely looks like a restaurant that took over what I can only guess must have been a very grungy working class tavern."}
{"text":"The top Thai restaurants in Vegas need to be put on notice, Baan Thai is serious competition!  This little spot in Chinatown has only been open for a few months.  The decor is simple and tasteful, the service was friendly and prompt and the food was BOMB!  Panang Curry that rivals Lotus of Siam, Larb that was spot on, and Tom Kha (that I personally thought needed a bit more lime) that my girlfriend said was the best she's had.  We were too stuffed for dessert but we will definitely be back again soon to try more of the menu. Big ups to the Chef holding it down in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Update: I brought the offending hairs back the next day and received a full refund with many apologies :)"}
{"text":"All of the curries were amazing... The teriyaki wings were amazing... The orange chicken delicious. The crab fried rice yummy. I will be back with the family."}
{"text":"This was a great lunch spot. We had the lunch special on a Friday and you get, soup, an egg roll and your entree. I got the Green Curry my BF got the pad Thai...both chicken. Level 3 was just the right spice for me. The pad Thai was average and the green curry I am in love with. The service was great! Very attentive and waters always full."}
{"text":"We ordered a pick up khan tom soup, yellow chicken rice, and mango sticky rice. I was a little to pick up, but the food was still pretty hot and delicious! Chicken was cooked well and the curry very tasty. Mango was sweet and rice was great. The soup was a pleasant medley of lemongrass, chicken, and coconut milk. Very satisfying for after work dinner!"}
{"text":"Im surprise they were not busy on a Saturday night.
Second time here and flavor never fails...Would probably recommend to add some wine selections or beer for date nights,but other than that service is good,food variety is awesome,i actually wanna comeback and try the french infused style.my children of four loved everything so does my husband..."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, so for kicks I like to text out different places and order off the menu. Gotta be honest, they did not disappoint. The service is excellent and I cleared an entire pitcher of iced tea. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I found 3 strands of hair on my pad thai! Took it to go and opened the container and found a pile of messy noodles with a side of human hair into the mix! I could not stomach the taste after that. It was just bland. Definitely not worth the $6.95 lunch special I paid for. I now regret not paying the extra $2  somewhere else like friendly thai or silk where I wouldn't find the chef's hair on my food .Take your hard earned money elsewhere.."}
{"text":"I felt adventurous today so I fired up Yelp to look for a new place to try for lunch. 

What caught my attention with Baan Thai was that it was under the category of \"vegetarian, vegan\". 

The reviews from my fellow Yelpers along with the close proximity to work made this an easy pick. 

We got in around 1130am. There were about 4 other parties already seated. It took a minute or so to get greeted and to get a table. 

I ordered from the lunch menu. I ordered the only vegetarian choice which was stir fried vegetables. The lunch came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. 

My impressions on the food. The egg drop soup was rather salty. The stir fried vegetables were good. It was served in a light brown sauce paired with white rice. There was definitely good flavor to the stir fry dish. The egg roll was mediocre. 

The service there could have been better. There was only one server working. The server worked as quickly as she could, tending to the tables, taking orders, brining out food etc. With the lunch crowd arriving I would have thought there would have been at least a few servers. The server did the best that she could. However, with only one server running the entire restaurant, service was a bit slow. 

I didn't dive deep into the menu but from what I read there didn't appear to be many vegan or vegetarian options. Under the vegetarian section there were about 5 different dishes to pick from. 

The establishment was clean. Located in the shopping plaza on the second floor it took me a minute to find it. I used the Yelp application to navigate to the shopping plaza. Once getting to the plaza we walked around to find it. 

For me the experience and the food quality was just so-so."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the meal here as it was truly authentic, totally reminded me of my time in Thailand!  We had the lunch combo specials and they were great priced with good portions but most importantly, amazing tasting!

This place is run by a nice family that knows Thai flavors.  So, give this place a try if you want something easy on the wallet, filling for your tummy, and dancing for your mouth.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I work at a hospital. We all decided on Thai food. 
We ordered through Grubhub. The delivery fee was $9... okay whatever.
I ordered, Mongolian beef, garlic lovers beef, chicken pineapple fried rice, and beef pad see ew. I've never received such small portions. I was so disappointed. 
The food was alright. The fried rice didn't have much flavor. The Mongolian was soupy. But maybe it was meant to be that way idk. Either way, it was so plain. The garlic one tases so good though.
Overall not happy. Portions was insanely small."}
{"text":"Best tofu ever. I actually thought it was real chicken. My Curry was perfect. Spice was on point"}
{"text":"Nothing worse than bland Thai food. The chicken curry was ok. I'll bet the cooks there are not Thai."}
{"text":"I was ordered this spicy Thai mint with pork. It's was so good and come in a good portion for lunch. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing that the management of the Indian Curry House doesn't own a watch and couldn't open on time.  Baan Thai is new at this location.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  Service needs a little bit of work, but I'm sure they'll get the kinks smoothed out."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't see great enigma of this restaurant. 

The atmosphere in here is very, awkward. Don't get me wrong, I loved the cozy feeling , but I didn't like how it felt that I was eating at somebody's  house. For example, the vacuum cleaner was visible. 

Our waitress only gave us 2 glasses of water for the 3 of us, and only 1 place mat. . Our waiter didn't ask us what drinks we wanted (just went straight to food).  Also unfortunately, my chicken pad Thai never came. My friends were all finished so i didn't bother to ask. The food was alright, nothing that stood out that would bring me back again though. All the food came at different times as well. 

Moreover, if your not into traditional Thai, there are plenty of alternatives in the area. 

(P.S I was still hungry, so i ended up having a blueberry muffin)"}
{"text":"Such a cute place, love the atmosphere and decor. Everywhere I go I request water without ice or room temperature and this is the first place that gets it. Besides that the green chicken curry was amazing. I'm a whimp when it comes to spicy so their lowest level was enough for me. The Thai beef salad was really good too. Egg drop soup was so so could have used a little more flavor. If I'm in this area again will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing, great place for a quick lunch or a nice dinner out.  Small, quaint with quality food.  Seriously I could eat here like 3 times a week and not get tired of it."}
{"text":"Very clean, very good, highly recommend.   Friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere.  Everything was fresh and the presentation was great. The owner is from Bangkok, so it is authentic."}
{"text":"Their tom yum soup is so delicious . It's only 10$ , can fit up to 3 person . Papaya salad is the bomb . Must go place . Service is good ."}
{"text":"Very good food. It is pricy except lunch special
However, servers need to pay attention more to customers"}
{"text":"Okay, so I used to LOVE this place. The green curry is amazing, still is. Over the last couple of years though it has really gone downhill. The curry is still great but calling for takeout is painful. I have to repeat my order several times to the woman. Although I have been patient I've ended up just saying sorry I'll call back. I feel bad but they really need someone who can take an order, I mean the first thing she asked me for was my credit card number, I hadn't even given her my order or my address. After the third time trying, tonight being my last, I've given up. Goodbye Baan Thai; hello Friendly Thai. :("}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I think this spot has a lot of potential. They were very clever about their logo for I'm wondering if they are affiliated with the popular North Hollywood CA bhan kanom Thai. It looked and felt familiar but the food is solid. We didn't do a lot of food it was basically breakfast so we ordered an entree each and one appetizer. 

Lad Na Shrimp 4.5/5- they put some extra love by adding a fried egg on top and it loved it. It would've been perfect if the noodles were more burned. I love it when the noodles have that extra char from the wok. 

KraPow fried rice shrimp 4/5- could've been better if the rice wasn't mushy. The flavors were on point though I would still order it again 

Todd Mann (fried fish cake) 5/5 -very traditional dish it tasted like my mom or grandma used to make it. I loved it 

I love the service they were so nice and accommodating and I would come back for sure to show you guys some love!"}
{"text":"I had chicken yellow curry and my husband had the duck curry, a signature dish. The first thing I noticed in both dishes was the complexity of the flavors. Both dishes were delicious and the best Thai I've had in China Town. The restaurant was clean with simple but pleasant decor. It was a great choice for \"date night.\" We plan to return."}
{"text":"Nice homey decor that will make you feel like you're invited to dinner to Thai family dinner.

The dishes they have is a hit or miss, I tried the tom yum seafood soup and the thai red curry with pineapple. Neither of the dishes blew me away. The seafood in the soup I questioned whether if it was frozen pre-cooke ones soaked in sour water with over cooked noodles. The red curry in the other hand, I would recommend getting the coconut rice to accompany to bring out the bland flavour of the watered down curry soup. 

I've tasted mediocre thai food, but this is just rookie."}
{"text":"The service is good but the food is either too salty or not enough salt. Love that they have vegan options but they definitely need to work on taste. Probably not going to come back to this place to eat."}
{"text":"Try the lunch special for $8 get the big portions of food. The place is very clean. Nice decorated.Service is on point . I got my pad thai very yummy my friend got the curry and she like it too. Overall we're love it and will come back to try more."}
{"text":"YIKES, worst delivery experience! Food was packaged improperly, causing the soup I ordered to leak all I've the rice and salad.  The chicken satays were dry, in fact pretty much everything tasted as though it was NOT made to order. Please don't order from Baan Thai - to add insult to injury, when I called to let them know how disappointed I was with the meal, they hung up on me."}
{"text":"Ordered Tom Ka Gai on Postmates. It tasted bland and rushed, and had very little flavor as it didn't boil long enough to get the flavor into the soup. 

It's the worst Tom Ka I had in Vegas at any Thai Restaurant (I always try Tom ka). It wasn't terrible but there's plenty of other better restaurants within a mile of Baan Thai, as far as Tom Ka goes. Maybe I'll give some other dishes a try, but this was disappointing.. 

The egg rolls were kinda shitty too and I didn't even finish those (which I always do if they are good).

No Yum Yum for these guys Tom Yum. Sorry! I really wanted to like the food."}
{"text":"First time here....definitely not the last! The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. The Thai Iced tea is the best!"}
{"text":"I would give three stars if the served more than two teaspoons of rice that came with my egg foo yung with gravy entree. The egg foo yung was really soaked with sweetened grave. It should be named Thai egg omelette submarine.
PAD THAI was delicious. Will I come back. You'll know if I give a redeeming review. Cost $23 plus tax for two dishes. 

Maybe better review next time."}
{"text":"Great food great service! Their delivery company Onlinerestaurants.com is amazing. Best service in vegas!"}
{"text":"I ordered vegan dishes to go. Omg they are so delicious. Drunken noodle with soybeef and spicy basil with soy chicken, are the best. I definitely highly recommend this place for vegan lover. You will fall in love with their foods just like I do."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I ordered the garlic salmon and my man the chicken Pad Thai both a 3 spicy. Both were delicious. The service was perfectly attentive and everything was very clean. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I've decided to go on a plant-based diet and decided to try this spot, their selection of vegan foods is limited but good thr spice  is very strong if you're brave enough to go at five my hat goes of to you I did try the four it was spicier than normal. Over all good"}
{"text":"Baan Thai recently added vegan menu to their restaurant. The food was fresh and just the right amount of taste. Love to see restaurants adding vegan menu options. Will recommend it to anyone who's vegan."}
