{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the Parkdale/High Park area.  The first time I walked in I was blown away by the layered aromas - mmm...  I love supporting local small restaurants, especially when they put so much love into their food!  They source their food locally, serve great organic coffee, and offer wholesome lunch combos.  Today I had a Saturday Scramble special (mediterranean), which was an amazing deal at 8 bucks for 3 eggs, spinach, feta, red peppers, red onion, well-seasoned homefries, a generous serving of fresh fruit (amazing variety) and a bun - I also got free refills on my coffee with breakfast.  I always manage to get a great spot in the sunny window which is great for people-watching.  They have free wifi and an abundance of smiles - the service has always been above and beyond, the few times I've been in here.  I hear the place is pretty busy weekdays during lunch and I'm surprised it's not packed on weekends!  Skip the brunch lineups down the street on Roncesvalles and head here instead for Real, home-cooked food made with love :)"}
{"text":"When I started working in Toronto, I was in despair of finding a restaurant that served healthy, home-style cooking until I happened upon Soup 'n Such.  I was warmly welcomed by both owners, Jeannette and Valerie, and introduced to their delicious brand of healthy meals.  All food is made from scratch, and they offer a variety of dishes that appeal to all dietary types, including vegan and vegetarian.  The meals are delicious and very reasonable, and the portions are an excellent size.  AND, it is extremely clean, which I appreciate as a trainer of safe food handling.

If you give it a try, you'll find it well worth the visit.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"So great to have a healthy, home made food option in the neighborhood! Especially good for people with food sensitivities as they have gluten free and vegan options. 
The ingredients are always fresh and the owner is so lovely and friendly whenever I go in.  Their prices are also totally reasonable.  A great quick, affordable, healthy lunch spot!"}
{"text":"WOW this has got to be the best place I've ever been to, they have a wide selection of food ( soups, salads, sandwiches & more,) and so healthy and fresh. Highly recommend to everybody in the area and out off the area, it's worth the trip"}
{"text":"Every meal I've had here has been absolutely delicious. The staff is welcoming and friendly; just as my 7-year old commented today when we picked up his favourite grilled cheese sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great healthy and tasty home made food. Awesome daily specials and staff is very welcoming. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What's better than soup to eat when you're feeling sick as a dog? Nothing! I went here yesterday because I was feeling under the weather and I needed something to eat. I went with the daily special which was a sweet potato curry soup and I got half a BLT on the side...because bacon also makes everything better. 

Both were really tasty! Really big portions too which was great. 

Their menu is pretty big with a bunch of soups/salads/sammys so if you have food allergies or dietary restrictions there is totally something for you here. 

Go here and get your soup on!!"}
{"text":"I popped into Soup n Such because I was killing time before an interview -- the Tim Hortons by Keele station was full, another place I tried didn't have wifi, and I just needed to get some school work done. 

When I walked in and up the few stairs, I was confused by the layout (the menu isn't behind the counter but rather on the wall in the seating area). I told the girl behind the counter that I'd never been there before and she pointed to the menu and mumbled some stuff about the day's soup. I told her I'd just take a coffee when she had a second (she was making a smoothie for the one other guy in the cafe). She responded by pointing at some cups on the counter and an air-pot of apparently fair-trade, organic coffee that said $1.75. Because I didn't want her to have to leave what she was doing, I asked if the price was tax-in and left $2 on the counter. She scoffed and came over to give me my change (which I made clear that I didn't need, saying \"I'm leaving $2 here\"). She was just unnecessarily grumpy. 

Coffee was lukewarm and nothing special. They have a water dispenser thing full of crusty looking lemons and barely-cool stagnant water. 

I asked the girl for the wifi password and she said nothing but handed me a piece of paper with it written down. The password was written in all capital letters so I asked her if that's actually how it should be entered. She looked at me blankly and told me that's \"just how her boss writes.\"

I don't know. I'm a friendly customer and I just feel that she made it seem like I'd done her wrong in some way. Won't be back -- I'll walk the extra block to Starbucks. 

ALSO: They have a little sign on the counter that offers a free bowl of soup for positive Yelp/Urbanspoon reviews! Lame."}
{"text":"Preface:  Louis Armstrong's \"Kiss to Build a Dream On\" began playing as I entered.  I knew this place was good the moment I set foot inside!

Soup 'n Such is a gem of a cafe at Dundas and Roncy, located juuuuuust outside what is often listed as one of Toronto's finest shopping and foodie neighbourhoods.  It is as though they stand as the vanguard of the 'hood as it inexorably advances beyond its boundaries to gentrify the outlaying area.

Owned and operated by a pair of hands-on ladies who seemingly handle every aspect of the business, the care invested in SnS really shows through.  Hand-written chalkboard menus, an open and easily viewed kitchen area, service by the chef or her partner (who doubles as sous)... what's not to like about that kind of attention?

Thankfully, the food matches the homestyle appeal.  From-scratch soups, fresh salads, daily specials that are actually... well, special!  I'm tired of chef's specials being castaways and also-rans that couldn't make the regular menu.  The day I dropped in, they had just sold out of their daily special -- squash soup -- and I heard a departing patron raving about how good it was.  Damned if I missed out.

I \"settled\" for the quinoa chili, served with a very generous side of spinach salad AND potato salad (sweet!).  Interestingly, the chili -- though very good -- played second fiddle to me in the taste department to their safe-but-excellent salads.  Spinach with cranberries and walnuts and their house yogurt/dijon dressing was perfect in its simplicity, and the potato salad was the kind of \"I didn't know I wanted this!\" addition that made me really, really want more.

I fear that they're out-of-the-way enough that they may not attract enough foot traffic to justify operation.  Conversely, my hope is that their obvious quality and love of their work will make up for a less-than-ideal spot, and the local lunch crowds will make haste to sample some awesome soups... especially as the weather turns to \"holy hell it's cold!\".

'Cuz every Canuck knows that a hot bowl of soup is just the thing to soothe a deep, Canadian chill!  (That and some badass hot cocoa... hm... I wonder if they plan on serving hot cocoa... with marshmallows of course...)

Just some random notes:

*  Great taste in music.  
*  Decent cup of coffee.  Fair trade and organic.
*  Website lists them closed on Saturday -- inside scoop says Saturday Brunch begins soon (maybe even October 15th, so call and see!)
*  Two levels helps make the otherwise small space seem much bigger than it is
*  Daily newspapers, including the weekly NOW.  Reading material! Yes!
*  Sammiches and soup/sammich specials, though I haven't sampled yet
*  Eco-friendly packaging.  
*  They even hand-wash dishes!  How retro cool is that???

... so?

Bottom line:  Recommended.  Yelpers, you can thank me later.

And, I'll give you just one thing before we part... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHjZQb-kGek&feature=related"}
{"text":"Food is great quality made with high quality ingredients even though meals only cost 8-9 bucks.  Service with a smile!  I prefer to carry out and I call ahead since the orders take a few minutes.  You have to make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Soup 'n Such is such a cute little homey restaurant with a whole lot of personality. Eating here felt like a comfortable visit to a good friend's home. The menu is extremely versatile and there seems to be something for everyone. 

You can see the food being made, which is always a super bonus in my books! I had the Thursday soup + salad special, which was a Moroccan stew and a spinach strawberry salad for about $9. Although the stew was hardly Moroccan (I've tasted harira soup in 4 cities in Morocco), it was hearty and delicious. The salad was a perfect way to end the meal- it was crunchy, fresh, and delicious.

I will definitely be visiting very often, as it is located conveniently right next to Dundas West station and not far at all from Roncesvalles. Great vegan options here too! Can't wait to try more soups on upcoming chilly fall days! :)"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a quick sandwich and met who I believe to be one of the owners. I wasn't able to catch her name, but she seemed sweet and very helpful and seemed to know a lot of the customers that dropped by :)

I ordered the BLT panini and it was DELICIOUS. I thoroughly enjoyed the panini and I highly appreciated the store's attention to biodegradable packaging ( although the little mashed potato cup I got on the side was plastic :(  ) 

I work nearby and looking at the price menu, this is definitely a place I'll drop by again for a healthy lunch or quick morning bite."}
{"text":"This place is the very definition of a hidden gem. Super friendly family run restaurant with fresh delicious food and fair prices. Have tried the smoked salmon, philly panini, lentil/turkey vegetable soup, and the Saturday scramble - all super delicious."}
