{"text":"Went on a Friday night at 6:45 and they said they were closed because they ran out of food! If they mismanage the kitchen like this, makes me wonder about the entire operation. Too bad too, because we just moved into the area and love Ethiopian."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tina's about 6 months ago by a friend. So grateful for the opportunity. Loved the food and thought the experience we had with Tina was a delight. I have been back a few times since and still walk away extremely satisfied each time. Tina's is definitely a cozy eatery and not a high end restaurant. If that is what you are looking for then this is not your place. When you enter Tina's you should go in with a laid back attitude and you are bound to have a pleasant experience. Tina's is very veg friendly and when you bring a bottle of wine with you...it makes the perfect little dining evening. :) The food here is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch the other day, she didn't even get me something that was on the menu, she just made me something from scratch! It was delicious and she makes you feel at home like you are a part of family. Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Tina's is a unique experience ... I have been telling all my friends about it!    The cafe is set up with cozy conversation nooks ... which are usually scooped up by the \"regulars\".  There are some picnic style tables where you might invite others to join you ... making for some very interesting conversation and meeting new folks. :-)   The first time we went we met someone who happened to be a piano student of a friend of mine!!  How strange is that? We also visited with Tina's husband who is as cordial as TIna.  Visiting Tina's Ethiopian is like visiting a friend's home.  The food is great and the atmosphere is very cordial.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Tina is so wonderful, the food is absolutely delicious, and she has great vegetarian options. :) All I can say is yummmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Apparently, the staff here is even worse than I thought. I, like several others, have now received extremely abusive and lewd messages from someone who is confirmed to work at Tina's, and by their own account, is part of the management. Unless you care to be treated like trash, called awful names, harassed, and threatened, I suggest you find someplace else to eat."}
{"text":"*********Original location closed. The new one has the window's papered and a sign that reads Chili Billy's coming soon.*********"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Tina's for the first time and we LOVED IT!!  It was so fun eating with your hands.  I also enjoyed the other customers.  Very friendly.  The food was yummy also.  We had first day on the job server and he smiled the whole while.  AND you can BYOB.. where does that happen?  Our kids are excited to try the food and eat with their hands. Try it out!  Fun night out."}
{"text":"Very yummy food. I loved the chickpea dish, as well as the cabbage with potatoes, carrots and other veggies. A mistake in the order was taken care of no questions asked, and we even got extra veggie dishes to take home with the extra injera bread, as well as Ethiopian iced tea on the house. We used a Groupon with no problem. The service was friendly and welcoming. We will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to try the food, which sounds delicious, because I was left literally standing in the rain. I bought the Groupon and was super excited to go. First, my friends and I could not find it because their sign says Chinese Bistro, so we drove by it several times (it was also pouring rain making it even more difficult to see). By the time we found it, it was 8:05. Tina's closes at 8 (on a Saturday night?). We got out in the rain and stood at the window looking in. There were people eating and the staff saw us, but they just ignored us as we stood outside in the rain because it was 5 minutes after 8. This really makes me not want to go back. I wanted to love this place as I love small local restaurants, but I felt so unwelcome, I'm not sure I'll go back, even with my Groupon."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience! Tina prepared our food, served us, and even brought extras of my favorite dish free of charge. We had a  Groupon which she happily accepted, and asked us to tell her if we thought the service was too slow (she must read the reviews). Service was actually prompt.  Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Tina provided a great experience and picked all the food for us. Hearing her stories and being around her positive energy was much appreciated. I would recommend going here if you want some authentic food that's not the cookie cutter Applebee's that plague AZ."}
{"text":"We were a fan of Tina's when it was on AZ Avenue so were very happy to see her reopen at the SE Corner of Warner and Cooper.  We were there on one of the first weekends she was open, so they are still working through the glitches.  The location is quite a bit smaller than the old location, and the ambiance is that of a Subway restaurant, but the food was as good as I remember it.  We took our 8 year old there and she also enjoyed the food.  We will definitely go back.  At present they do not serve alcohol (don't know if that is in the plans), but I did see a couple folks bring in bottles of wine.   Highly recommended for the food!"}
{"text":"I am trying to like Tina's Ethiopian. Love the concept; small business, great food..... I will give it one more try at least. Tina seems like a character!   First impression: Walk in the door and get greeted with \"Do you have a Groupon\"? Well, no, I don't, but now I  feel badly about it. We had a delicious lunch for cheap and were delighted. Met Tina, who told me next time, to bang on the back door if it looks like she is closed, she will feed me\".   Time two, had a meal that was half the food for a third more the price. Lots of bread. The sign on the door says closed at 1:30. But we walked in anyway (rather than bang on the back door) The website says open until 3pm for lunch. This is quintessential Tina. I'm trying.......  This restaurant is closed. The location is now a Thai place...."}
{"text":"I posted this on Google, but I had such a bad experience I felt people on Yelp needed to know as well. The comments I saw about other people being stalked by Tina after posting negative reviews do not improve my impression of this restaurant, but thankfully that has not happened to me, yet.  We had a groupon to come here, but will not be going back.  As we walked in the door at 6 p.m., the store was empty, the staff was sitting around, and they rudely told us we needed to make a reservation to eat here. A stupid policy for an empty restaurant, I think, and if all else had been good I might have excused this annoying oddity. At least they didn't require us to go outside and call in a reservation on our cell phone. They gradually got off their butts and went to the kitchen, while leaving pizza boxes from their meal strewn about the restaurant. Finally, a server, a girl who looked to be about 13 came over to us and asked us, \"So.... what do you guys... like... want, I guess?\" We ordered, I asked for a coke, but when she came back with a tiny bottle that would be way too expensive, I sent it back.   After about 45 minutes, our food finally came. It was ok, decent for Ethiopian standards, but one dish was too dry. One of the dishes we ordered never came, so we asked for them to send it out to us to take home, which took another great while. When the bill came, we were charged for the coke as well as one of the dishes twice, so we needed to sort that out, which took another chunk of time.   The service by the staff the whole time was carried out with great annoyance, as if we should be grateful to them that they deigned to serve us at all. The service we received is frankly inexcusable. Others that have gone there told us that this must have been an exceptionally bad night, but admitted the service wasn't exactly fantastic most of the time either.  If you really want to eat some good Ethiopian food with decent service, take the drive to tempe."}
{"text":"Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.)   this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)  So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up.   I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that:  http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg  So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell).   \"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol\"  Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number: http://i.imgur.com/6j55D.png  So if you feel like this is a place you would like to try out after reading this, by all means take your chances."}
{"text":"the first time I had Ethiopian food was at Tina's ehiopian cafe in 2000. It was just delicious. When I moved to Tucson i missed her food. No other restaurant comes close to her food. I try to visit whenever I go to Chandler. The quality of her food is excellent."}
{"text":"So Tina moved locations and I've tried twice to get in. I'd love to eat here, but 2 Friday nights in a row no one answers the phone there and both Fridays they've had a private party. So I'm not too sure that I'll waste another drive over there. Our norm is Cafe Lalibela, but it's a drive, so this was nice and close. oh well"}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite restaurants in the whole world!!!! Tina is the sweetest proprietor and friendliest chef you'll ever meet- so friendly that like many others have said here, it doesn't feel like going to a restaurant- more like going to a friend's house. Except that this friend happens to always be down to cook you amazing slammin' Ethiopian food for super-cheap. Who wouldn't want to visit that friend all the time?  If you want to impress your date by spending a lot of money in a dark intimate setting, this is not the place. But I'd rather have amazing food, reasonable prices and a casual family atmosphere in a small business that remembers me, any day. Tina sits down and chats with me when it's slow, or introduces me to other regulars. What other restaurant does that? Tina is awesome, and we isolated Americans have a lot to learn from her."}
{"text":"I would like to try this place, but they are unresponsive to customers.  It seems that they tried to advertise with Groupon, and then didn't actually like it when customers tried to redeem their Groupons.  --Did not answer the phone repeatedly --Actually spoke to her once, and she told me to text her.  I texted, got no reply. --Showed up at the restaurant at 4:30PM on a Saturday, and the doors were locked.  No answer to knocking or calling the phone.   --Other customers were outside, waiting.  One couple actually had a 4PM reservation, and was still waiting outside nearly an hour later.  Tina's Ethiopian Cafe is not treating their customers with respect, and this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy eating food from different cultures? The owner of this place is Ethiopian, and you will get to know her if you eat there..... she is wonderful. She is very sweet and you will begin to understand Ethiopian culture simply by chatting with her. She cooks all of this food herself and she told us the bread takes a few days to make. She does hang around and talk quite a bit to custormers, which is part of the charm of the place. The restaurant itself  is small, but nicely decorated in a fun way. Brightly painted walls adorned with African artwork makes you feel as though you are in someone's home.   We got a vegan platter for two and it was wonderful. There were a few different lentil dishes and a salad served with Ethiopian bread that you use almost like a tortilla to pick up bites of your food. You don't use silverware, which is difficult when you are used to using a fork to eat. It was messy. You can bring your own wine to this place if you would like to.   My only suggestion would be for this restaurant to offer silverware to guests. It was a little tough eating the food without it.   Will I go back?  YES"}
{"text":"Tina's is now in Gilbert on the southeast corner of Cooper and Warner. Tina informed us that she's still working on the sign, so don't expect to spot it from the road (it's next to Blew Smoke Cigars if you need a hint). We loved Tina's. We set out to order the combo plate for two and Tina told us, no one order would be fine for lunch :) She was correct it was a lot of food.  It was delicious and well prepared. Tina chatted with us for a while and that was fun. We'll return."}
{"text":"Food = mehh, service = subpar, what else is there to say?  Save your money. You'll be happy you did.  I know i'm asking for Tina to stalk and insult me on Yelp by posting this bad review, but Tina, the truth shall set you free. You can choose to accept it and change your restaurant's operating policies, or you can ignore everyone and struggle to make things work."}
{"text":"good and plentiful portions in  comfortable setting.  Lalibellas in Tempe is just a little better.  However, when in Gilbert, this is the only option for good ethoipian."}
{"text":"Tina, instead of harassing people, try spending your time on improving and building your business (if that's even possible.) You are the most unprofessional business owner I have ever encountered. You accuse people who give your cafe negative reviews of things that are not only true, but preposterous (yes, look it up.) You claim to have all these supporters (true or not) but by judging how you abuse people, you may not have many to speak of soon..especially when they realize that you have kids working at your low-rate establishment. I can only feel sorry for you and your business.   To all the people who are thinking about going to this place: spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere. There are so many small businesses who will treat you right and make your money spent well worth it. This \"cafe\" is not one of them. If you do end up going there, and happen to write a negative review, brace yourselves for a string of abusive and harassing replies to your review.   To Tina: spend your time on your business, not on harassing people. Maybe you can even see a therapist, you seem to have a lot of issues (disconnect from reality, lying, anger, inability to take criticism and improve, consistent defamation of other honest people..should I go on?!) You are a sad excuse for a small business owner, and it's people like you who give a bad rep to your country."}
{"text":"I'll give 5 stars for the overall experience. Walking into Tina's Ethiopian Cafe is like walking into someones living room. And you might actually be. The setting is conducive to conversation- within your own group or with everyone else in the restaurant. We prefer to sit in the mismatched lazyboys. My first time at Tina's, the hubski and I crashed with four other friends. Tina bought out a sampler of almost everything she offers. There really is no need for a menu in her living room. We all enjoyed spiced hot black tea and ate until we were all stuffed. She came out and scolded us for not finishing our food, \"Do you know how hard it is to cook this?\" While my buddy Kevin tried to explain to her that we were not insulting her food, and that we were actually full, I stuffed my mouth with everything left on the plate in a very unlady-like fashion. Hey- I come from a Russian Jewish family and I have learned that food tastes better than guilt. After dinner, Tina offered us slices of \"real NY cheesecake\", which I don't think she usually has there. When we got the bill, it was $35 each. For 6 of us. Total. Since I read a review stating that Tina does not accept tips, we dropped $30 per couple...  AND RAN to our cars before she could stop us.  We've been back many times since. I think she has learned to accept tips. Sometimes the food is a 5, sometimes its a 4, but it always satisfies. And the price? Well, Tina's cooking is cheaper than mine at home. Nice."}
{"text":"Very homey and you definitely get authentic Ethiopian food here.    Ethiopian music videos play in the background and books on Ethiopian culture are at each table.  Honestly, I've had better Ethiopian food in Chicago, IL and in Berkeley, CA...but this is the best Ethiopian I've had in the Mesa/Chandler area of Arizona."}
{"text":"I never thought I would say that Ethiopian food is my favorite food but a few years ago I met a woman from Ethiopia who introduced me to the cuisine.  Over the years we parted ways but my love for the food was still there! Now anytime I am craving the earthy hearty vegetarian wat and injera I just head over to Tina's. Not only is the food great Tina herself is lovely and always willing to answer any questions I have. Sometimes the wait is a little long but it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I first must start by giving kudos to the service at Tina's.  It is a very good cultural experience where you don't have to travel far and feel as if you are in another country, the bread \"teff\" is amazing, and all those awesome flavors make this experience amazing. I highly recomend their food and their service \"you will feel like a family member\". Thank you."}
{"text":"I tried three different times to go to Tina's--something I had really looked forward to when I returned to Chandler--but found the place closed all three times.  This was a new location across the street from the original one and looked totally different inside when I looked thru the window.  Finally, on the third try on my last day in  town, I went into the bar next door to ask the lady bartender if she had any info.  To my great disappointment she said it was closed for good.  What a shame!  Tina--If you're out there and read this get in touch with me and let me know if you ever re-open!"}
{"text":"We went to Tina's Ethiopian Cafe for lunch today. SUCH a wonderful experience!  We purchased a Groupon a few months ago & we were finally able to use it today.   When we walked in, we had lovely greeting from Tina herself. So customer service oriented & warm. The food was DELICIOUS!!! And upon looking at the menu(we had a Groupon so no need to worry about prices..but we were curious) we were SO impressed with how reasonable everything was! Lunch for one was $6!! And that included 3 entrees (one meat dish +  2 veggie dishes), Plus all of the homemade Injera that you want or need.  We ate at 12:30 and it is currently 7pm. We are STILL full! But not a \"heavy feeling\" of full. Just simply still satisfied .....with a homecooked meal in our bellies.  And for some odd reason, Tina will not take tips......??? But if anyone deserves a tip, it's HER! She works so hard, making everything from scratch, with love. And she is so warm & inviting.    In closing...PLEASE try this restaurant, Yelpers. LOVELY EXPERIENCE!!  I don't think you will be disappointed. I had never tried Ethiopian food before & we WILL most certainly be returning!  Thank you Groupon & most importantly, thank you TINA! Looking forward to coming for dinner some night!   I will try to figure out how to upload a photo of our meal....."}
{"text":"Yes, i am a fan. This is one of my favorite places to eat. moved from New Jersey and use to eat at a great Ethiopian resturant there. Let me start by saying, Yes Tina is talkative but with craing and great conversation. If you are not use to a home felt place to eat out then this experience will be new to you. The food is great with a flare. The price is very affortable.  My husband and I love the vegetables and beef. the spices are unique and the food is of good quality. You can tell she uses healthy, reduce fat items so you won't have greasy food. I have a very sensitive stomach and loving leaving Tina's feeling good even the next day.  If you are not sure what you want to eat, Tina with a smile will offer you something special \"her choice\" which is a taste of ethiopian dishes.   The service right now was only her and please check hours. I would recommend Tina's and looking forward to taking my out of town guest here for a good ole great tasting experience.............   Keep focus Tina on your business growth. We love your food........."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food.  We let the owner customize a plate for us.  Very flavorful!  The owner was extremely personable and nice.  If I'm in the area I wouldn't mind stopping by again."}
{"text":"http://www.groupon.com/deals/tinas-ethiopian-cafe?fb_ref=anonymous&fb_source=profile_multiline  omg, tina's is open again... new location: Cooper Marketplace 785 W Warner Rd., Suite 103  Gilbert, Arizona 85233   get your groupons now!  i used to be a regular here, best food and company in town!"}
{"text":"I have never met anyone more friendly than Tina.  She would not accept a tip, and another woman (who was watching American Idol there... and who is a regular) said that trying to sneak her a tip is pointless- she tried it once and Tina accidentally threw the money out.  There is also a 2-for-1 coupon in the PHX entertainment book... so take it, see if you can hang with the sheet covered couches, and give this place a shot.  Also ask Tina if she is planning any more special events -- for Valentine's Day 2007 she had dancers and a buffet for $30 a couple."}
{"text":"So, i was really looking forward going there and was all excited and all. We drive up there, and find this little place squeezed between like auto repair and welding shop. No big deal, best gems are hidden right?  We go inside to find this dude just sitting on the middle of one of two rooms reading newspaper. For a second i was dazed and thought we accidentally walked into someones house. But no this was right place, it just seems/feels like someone else's house.   So, dude told us to grab some dinky table and wait, and got back to his undoubtfully exciting newspaper. Humm, ok, wait we shall, gives us a minute to look around. Hey, what do you know! It totally is like someone home -A little dirty, a little old, mismatched furniture around, pizza boxes on the counter, shaky table, some people you not sure weather they there to fix stuff or they belong. Alright, whatever.  Finally this lady shows up and hands us some menus. We pick a few thing and off she goes. About 20 min later something shows up. Did we order two of same? No, we surely did not. Hummm starnge.  Anyhow, it was bland and uninteresting. Nothing special about it. Place was kinda dirty, as i said. Service .... well there was really no service to speak of.  I suppose if you like this kind of establishments, it might be for you. But if i wanna sit in the dinky kitchen and eat boring food i can just head out to my Mother-in-Law. We surely aint coming back there.  \"Its great! NOT!\"  Eugene  PS: Whomever it was had absolutely no reservations taking my tip. Just FYI."}
{"text":"Great experience!!!!... had a long day at work so ended up coming to Tinas about 8:00 PM... not very busy... sat right down and was helped by Tina right away.  She recommended the vegetarian combo so we got that... tons of food... ALL VERY GOOD... Injera bread was the best we have had and better in our opinion than our other favorite ethiopian restuarant in az.    On the contrary to the past reviews-- Tina has to be the nicest person you could ever meet.  She is extremely friendly and likes to talk but it is just because she is a kind good person and wants the best for her restuarant and customers... We will definately be back and look forward to trying other things.    Thank you TINA for a great experience and dinner!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today and sampled the food and atmosphere. The owner (Tina, obviously) is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. The restaurant is small and cozy and eclectically decorated.   The food - now, I've never really eaten Ethiopian food. Tina had to kind of give me a quick instruction on it. She put the plate down and my first instinct was to take a photo (and now I wish I had) - it was beautiful. She explained that she makes her own bread - it's a special sort of bread that's almost like a cross between pancake and a European fluffy/spongy crumpet. Next to it is a smaller plate filled with sauce and meat and vegetables.   It looked a little messy, so I looked around for silverware. Silver-where? What? No silverware? I'm sure she had some, but she said I should eat with my fingers and told me how it works - using the bread to scoop up the meat and sauce. I had a bite of spicy chicken - OMG so good! Then I tried the ground beef - also OMG amazing!  I took some home for my girlfriend who didn't even wait until I got inside the house - she met me in the garage and scarfed down a bunch of it. She also thought it was delicious. We're definitely going to have dinner here soon.   I noticed a bunch of low reviews here and for the most part they are from people who didn't actually eat there or that bought an online coupon deal. I'm not going to bad mouth any daily deal site (sometimes they can help put a business on the map), but I can tell you that for a small business like this, it can be financially devastating doing a coupon or daily deal like this.   Restaurant owners are asked to sell something for half price and then only get to keep half of that. It's safe to assume they lose money every time they do one. Also, they don't see any money from it for months. Also, the coupon customers often only show up someplace when there's a coupon involved. Restaurant owners aren't coached on how to get these customers to come back in to pay full price.   And then to try to use an expired coupon and trash a tiny independent restaurant online when they won't accept it anymore - that's even more bad news for the restaurant owner. It just doesn't seem fair. I don't know. It seems like the opposite of supporting local to me.   This restaurant is cute and charming and the owner is awesome. The food is incredible, and I'm a super picky eater who won't eat anything. I'm a fan of Ethiopian now. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am ecstatic that this place re-opened! Tina's feels like going to eat at your mom's house. The food is great, the atmosphere is friendly and it might as well be free considering what you get for your money. I took a first timer to Ethiopian food and he said he's going to be a regular there from now on. I can't wait to go back myself.  I guess one could complain that things are not the most organized, but that makes it almost more endearing to me. To those negative reviewers who say they appreciate small businesses I suggest you give it another chance with an open mind."}
{"text":"If you think the service and food is bad, just wait until you write a bad review for this disgusting, dirty poor excuse of a restaurant. My boyfriend and I gave it try because of a groupon he had purchased, and like many others that attempted to redeem it...they treated us like we were trash. I don't think they understand the concept of coupons, otherwise they would have tried to make more of an effort. The fact of the matter is, businesses use coupons and promotions to gain a regular population of customers and bring in revenue...but here at Tina's, they use it as a scam. Well it worked, my boyfriend bought the groupon and Tina's found a reason why we couldn't use it EVERY time we tried to use it. They also have little children working there so maybe they should be checked out concerning child labor laws. My boyfriend has been getting harassed non-stop for giving his honest experience with this business on yelp, not only over yelp messaging but by text message also (apparently their business phone is a cell phone and when he called to make sure the messages were from an employee they saved his number after cussing him out). They continue to be unprofessionally vulgar with the language, threatening and were very racist in their messages (calling him a dirty mexican--when he's not even hispanic) which is UNACCEPTABLE. I am ready to hear the racist and demeaning words they have for me, but I think the world should know how disgusting this place is. DO NOT SUPPORT BUSINESSES LIKE THIS, THEY SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH TREATING PEOPLE WITH SUCH A LACK OF RESPECT. There are so many other well-deserving, hard working, personable businesses/restaurants that deserve your time and money. And please believe me, when I get the treats and disrespectful messages because of this review it is going straight to the yelp offices and all over the internet.  Oh and btw, the person harassing us is an employee there and has written a five star review, so I wouldn't trust any of the good reviews on here. This place needs to get shut down."}
{"text":"Had my first visit to Tina's today after picking up a \"dinner for two\" groupon deal that offered a $26 meal for $13. It was a mixed, but good overall experience.  For those who don't know, Tina's just reopened in a new location. It's on the SE corner of Warner and Cooper. The restaurant doesn't even have signage yet - it says \"Chinese Cuisine\" above the entrance.   When we arrived, there was only one other couple in the restaurant. We were greeted casually by Tina, who told us to sit anywhere. Seating and decor were sparse; traditional music was playing in the background. We took a seat in one of the booths along the wall. The restaurant smelled a bit like the Cigar shop next door.  After a few minutes, Tina came over to introduce herself and take our order. We were offered menus, but since we were there on the groupon deal, we knew we were getting the House Watt Combo - a combo platter of meat and vegetarian dishes served over a thin, spongy, sour bread.  After a short wait, our meal arrived. It looked fantastic - a beautiful mix of color and texture. Tina explained every dish and gave us a quick lesson on how to eat it. (Pick up the food with the bread and enjoy). There were slow-cooked meat/sauce dishes, chickpeas prepared a couple of different ways, collard greens, a chicken wing, and a mixed green salad.  It seemed like each dish was better than the last, making it very hard to pick a favorite. Some were spicy, others smokey. In the middle of the platter was a tart, spicy salad that was amazing. The slow-cooked chicken wing in sauce fell off the bone and was super tender and flavorful. As an Ethiopian food noob, all the flavors were completely new to me and I enjoyed them all.  So, why was the experience \"mixed\"? Actually, it wasn't really for me - I appreciate informal, no-frills places. But in the end, the service was very hit or miss... Tina either hovered and chatted for a several minutes or was non-existent. There was no in between. Also, since Ethiopian food is traditionally eaten with your hands, there were no utensils - which was fine - but there were no napkins available or offered. That was a bit of an inconvenience.   My recommendation: Go to Tina's strictly for the food. It's a very casual, non-traditional dining experience, so check your service expectations at the door and you're sure to be pleased. The food is worth any shortcomings in the service.   You're not likely to leave Tina's feeling pampered, but you will be full and happy."}
{"text":"Had to update my review. Second trip here was awful. Tina did not even ask us what we wanted. We did the combo plate that is normally $20 and it was cold and bad.  Service girl was very weird and made us uncomfortable by standing over us watching us eat."}
{"text":"Would love to try this place but since they close so early (8pm) I need to do take-out as to not keep the place open later.  Unfortunately, I've called them on 4 separate occasions and have yet to have someone actually answer the phone.  I only get the recording.  This is beyond frustrating as I'd love to try it, as I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian food and am very excited about it's addition to Gilbert.  It appears they don't really need, nor want the business though.  So until they learn how to operate a business with customers in mind... 1 star.  I understand they may be busy, but then offer online ordering on the website, put a message on the voicemail, hire a helper during busy hours... or don't, and continue to lose customers.  It's not unreasonable to call a business during it's business hours, and expect an answer, at least by the second try."}
{"text":"We went for the grand-opening at her new Gilbert location. This is the essence of casual dining- you walk in and you feel like you've entered someone's home. It's a sit wherever attitude, with a \"hey how are you doing!\" like you've known Tina and her staff for years.   The menu isn't huge so it's easy to decide what to have- and if you can't decide, get the combo platter so you can have a little of many things. Everything is also fresh. Tina came out and talked to everyone, and told us that she doesn't like to freeze her food, so you will have fresh ingredients each time you visit. It's also made to order, so don't be in a rush. It's completely worth the wait. Our drinks stayed full and the decor contains many conversation pieces.   The flavors in the beef and chicken were amazing, and the bread had an extra-sour taste to it which was an excellent compliment to the meal.   I will go visit Tina again very soon!  PS- They don't have a sign up yet, so for now if you look for the China Bistro sign that's where Tina's is. Go. Eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Tina was quite the hostess, server, etc. She pretty much does it all and does an amazing job! It is not your typical chain restaurant, go there with an open mind and patience. It is a real pleasure to have such a personalized dining experience in the Phoenix area. We were the last table served on a Saturday night so we had the pleasure of having Tina sit and visit with us. She has such a spunky personality! It was a true delight. A quick tip, BYOB, the restaurant does not serve alcohol. Looking forward to our next visit! Wonderful night, great food, great people - thank you Tina!"}
{"text":"Where to start...  First of all, this place is very small.  I highly recommend you make a reservation, as there isn't much room for seating, and Tina makes all the food herself, so once it's gone, there is no more for the day.  MAKE A RESERVATION.  Secondly, this is a very mom and pop establishment, don't expect anything fancy.  It's pretty spartan and humbly decorated with the obligatory worn posters of Ethiopia.  Thirdly, do not expect to eat and run here.  Tina is an absolute hoot.  Not only extremely friendly, she is also extremely talkative.  She is one of those types of people that is so nice and chatty that you hate to have to say \"Our kids were supposed to be in bed a half an hour ago.\"  Speaking of kids, the great thing about this place is that if your kids aren't into Ethiopian fare just yet, she has the goods to keep kids happy:  Corn dogs and mac and cheese.   If you have never had Ethiopian, be prepared to not have any silverware on the table.  While silverware is available on request, it is Ethiopian culture to eat with your hands.  All meals are served with rolls of enjera, an unleavened bread that has a slightly sour taste.  You basically tear a piece of bread off the roll and then use it to grab your food.  If the kiddos are into the ethnic food, they'll love eating with their hands!  Onto the food...  The food here is excellent.  As mentioned earlier, Tina makes everything from scratch, and with lots of love, and it shows.  The menu is pretty limited, but what is on the menu is all delicious.  There are meat and vegetarian entrees, and go from not spicy at all to nose running spicy.  If you like spicy try the beef tibbs.  She also has a house salad that is excellent!  There are no appetizers, no expensive dessert menu.  All the dinner entrees are under $7, and the house watt combo is about $12, and is a lot of food, probably more food than most people can eat.  Still hungry?  Never fear, Tina is always there to give you seconds.   Beware, Tina is a food pusher.  She is not happy unless you have to be rolled out of there on a dolly.  IF YOU LEAVE THERE ANYTHING OTHER THAN STUFFED BEYOND IMAGINATION IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT.   Lastly, if Tina is your server, don't even think about tipping.  She flat out refuses tips, and will run after you if you leave money on the table.  Tina's Ethiopian Cafe isn't a restaurant, it's an experience!  ALSO:  This restaurant is now located at the Southwest corner of Cooper (Stapley) and Elliot next to Blew Smoke cigar shop"}
{"text":"This is not Cafe Lalibela or even close. I was so excited to have Ethiopian food so close. I Grabbed a take out sampler to go. No one was in there and when I got home I threw away most of it because of a bad smell. I am no stranger to Ethiopian food and this was really not good."}
