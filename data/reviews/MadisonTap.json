{"text":"Amazing service, courtyard, and selections. The poutine is Grade A. Compliments to the chefs. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there with some friends on Sunday night.  The place was empty, which was sad because the food was Delicious!  We had the Heirloom tomato bruschetta , Lamb sliders, Fried mushrooms, Duck wings and Poutine, everything was delicious, but the lamb sliders and duck wings were the best!"}
{"text":"Teetering on a 4-star, but just shy...   Tempted by a glowing review on madison.com, we headed over to MadisonTap Saturday night with lofty expectations. I'll give them high marks for the beer selection and atmosphere--this is a great venue to sample a range of beers from rotating local breweries, and you can spend hours on the excellent outdoor patio relaxing and finding your new favorite microbrew (be sure to ask for a sample if you're not sure). The indoor bar also had a great vibe, so it's worth a stop for a drink or two if the weather isn't great. Kudos to the staff, very knowledgable with the beverage part of the menu. I'd say the prices for both beer and food were just right. Portion size was good, each dish was about perfect for two people to share.   But what lured me here was the promise of great food, and here's where things fell short. We ordered the lamb sliders, duck confit taco, fried mushrooms and the pad thai. The winner in this batch was the duck confit taco, great flavors and very juicy. The lamb sliders came in a close second--not too gamey, moist patties, but needing some seasoning. The fried mushrooms were about as expected--way better than the Sysco fried mushrooms you'd expect at a bar, just the right amount of salt, but an average dish. The real disappointment was the pad thai salad. I was told it was a cold salad, and yes it came that way, but it wasn't a great riff on pad thai like I'd hoped: the flavors weren't really \"Thai\" (think cold Asian noodle salad) and parsley made an odd appearance when cilantro might have been the better choice. Lots of folks were ordering the poutine, might go back here when the beers rotate to give that dish a try.  The staff did a nice job of serving the dishes at a nice even pace, but the dishes didn't get sent out in the order that I was told initially--not a huge deal, but it would be nice to know the actual order in case you want to pair a style of beer with a particular dish.  There were a few little hiccups that I'd normally overlook but altogether they just dampened the overall experience (one dish I ordered didn't make it into the system, my bill showed two beers I didn't order and it missed one beer I did order, a lot of the high top tables were wobbly, etc.). Hopefully these will improve over time, and with a menu refresh (and a website where I can check the menu) I can see myself coming back to give the place another try."}
{"text":"I found MadisonTap when I was searching for restaurants offering \"deals\" on Yelp. It was a bit difficult to figure out all the details on the web, it appears they have an incomplete website and social media page. But, I figured, why not?   I was definitely not let down. My dining partner is pescatarian but we still found many options on their small dining menu. We ordered shishito peppers, fried mushrooms, poutine (no glaze = veggie friendly), and the bruschetta. We ordered the food at the bar and then sat at our table, where it was brought to us.   The food came out one item as a time (maybe 1-2 minutes apart ). This worked out for us as we were sharing everything. The peppers were great. I had never had a dish like that before but they were very mild (my dining partner compared them to pea pods) and served with a delicious sauce. Mushrooms also great -- addictive vinaigrette. Poutine was indulgent. The dish we were least impressed with was the bruschetta, the bread was toasted but cold/maybe stale? No trouble though, the servings were huge and delicious food was plentiful.   I love the tap takeover idea. They were wrapping up Karbeb4 in our visit. The bartender offered a sample or two to each of us before we ordered our pint. Great service. Aesthetics are great, very clean and sleek looking."}
{"text":"This is definitely a new favorite in the Madison beer scene. Every month they have a tap take over where they offer all offer several different tabs from one brewery. So far we've been a couple of times and have gotten the pleasure to try the different rotating taps. The food is unbelievably good, I highly recommend the shishito peppers. The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. The best part is the patio. The Robina courtyard patio is gorgeous and offers a unique experience in Madison. I'd argue to say it is one of the best patios in town. Another thing we like about Madison top is the variety of games they offer. So it's a great place to hang out with some friends on an afternoon in the summer. They are also very dog friendly so we love bringing our pup there."}
{"text":"Order the lamb sliders!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu - very tasty.  Good selection of WI brews and lounge music.  Don't miss this place while driving up East Wash."}
{"text":"Our group met for happy hour at Madison Tap and we had an excellent time. The bartender was knowledgable about the beer and very helpful in selections. This space is incredible and the appetizers were equally incredible. If you have never had a duck taco or are looking for a \"knock your socks off\" appetizer to start with, do NOT miss it."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed. I really really really wanted to love this place. And I mean it! I had such high hopes. A glowing madison.com review, a nice courtyard, a former Heritage Tavern sous chef, rotating beers, I mean what could go wrong? But oh dear. The courtyard is nice and the beer was fresh but the food was a huge disappointment. My bf had read the aforementioned review which gave huge thumbs up but our experience was quite different.   You order at the bar then grab a seat out in the courtyard. The bartender was almost friendly but mostly seemed kinda bothered to be working. We ordered our beers, some food and a grabbed a seat outside. My beer was a bad pour-nearly 1/3 foam-but it had been poured in a mug (I ordered the breakfast beer) so I couldn't tell until we were settled at our table. The tall tables were all quite wobbly but that's where we wanted to sit so fixed it ourselves with some nearby rocks.  We ordered the mushrooms, pad thai and salmon lox. The highlight definitely was the salmon lox. Outstandingly fresh and a wonderful melding of flavors but there's just no way a half a bagel is enough to keep me coming back. The mushrooms just plain fell flat and were basically flavorless. When my bf ordered the pad thai, I reminded him that the article had mentioned it was cold. The bartender said no, it's not cold but more room temperature. Nope, those noodles were cold. The temperature wasn't necessarily the issue but again, this dish just lacked some overall flavor and it definitely wasn't even reminiscent of pad thai save for some crushed peanuts. There's only a few other items on the menu so I don't have high hopes for a much better experience if we come back. Granted, the stars of the show are supposedly the lamb sliders and they were out of those.  We over heard the owner chatting with another table. He was talking about the live music schedule as well as nights featuring latin dance lessons. None of this is anywhere to found on the website or social media. Very strange. It's a nice space with a lot of potential but given its location and tough parking situation, there isn't much to bring me back."}
{"text":"Madison tap is great.  Beautiful courtyard, nice people.  Good music.  Check it out.  Don't wait!"}
{"text":"This is a really fantastic place to try a great selection of beer in a super cool atmosphere! Just stopped in for the first time last evening and had a Coffee Dark beer that was FAAAAAAABulous!!! The food menu was small but impressive and I had the Poutine Special, which hit the spot. The BarKeep was cool and well-informed and was great with popping out to the patio to check in from time to time. The interior vibe is hip and fun and The Robina Courtyard is just the most excellent, tucked away spot to hang out...they've done a stupendous job in creating a cool and unique atmosphere, not to mention, it's dog friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is very good! We had lamb sliders and poutine and they were even better than anticipated. The brewery on tap this month is Hinterland and I loved their stovetop the best. Good ambiance and music in the background too. Definitely worth visiting this place for dinner/drinks!"}
{"text":"I adore MadisonTap. Phenomenal courtyard, great concept of a rotating tap takeover, and really great people running the bar. I look forward to seeing what the new brewery will be each month, and having more time to dive into the food menu in future trips. But for now, for cold beer in a wonderful setting, MadisonTap is definitely my place to go!"}
{"text":"This was a fun find for us while we were in town. It was a bit hard to locate - we heard live music but couldn't tell if we could enter from the back. We entered from the front of the building. It looks like they feature a different brewery every month. The interior of the bar was pretty classy and new.   Their patio was very cool and spacious. A great patio for evening drinks! The live music was pretty good too. Can't speak to the food however, since we didn't eat there."}
