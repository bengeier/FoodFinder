{"text":"Seafood jambalaya without rice, presentation was better then the food.a bit pricy for what you get. Still good, but nothing special.fries were excelent. great outdoor seating for people watching and relaxing. Great Nola bear selection!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! is my first comment. Must try it!  This is our first ever visit to Pittsburgh and my wife and I enjoy new foods. We ate lunch today in Market Square and the waitress recommended a neighboring restaurant called Nola's for dinner. She explained they have a jazz band and the food is good. We walked over after lunch to make a reservation. The earliest was fir 9:15 because \"it's Saturday night\" the friendly host said. When we arrived the band was playing easy jazz music and laughter filled the restaurant. We were seated immediately and likewise greeter by Greg our waiter. He sports a great handlebar mustache.

We looked over the menu and decided to choose the frog legs appetizer. We never had them before - another first. They were quickly served in a mushroom in lemon and bacon sauce that was so succulent we immediately decided we would try other items on the menu we've never had.

We then tried the fried alligator also off the appetizer menu. Again it arrived shortly thereafter. Amazingly savory spicy flavors with the alligator.

We the had the oyster stew. Again a deliciously savory taste to the stew.

Continuing on with the theme for the night we had the wood roasted quail. Another first. It's served on a bed of rice pilaf and cranberry Pinot noir with fresh asparagus.

This was and evening if firsts and we truly enjoyed topping our visit to Pittsburgh. My wife and I have been married for over 31 years and she has always enjoyed great food. Nola's was an experience which quickly and easily jumps to the top of our list of favorite places to eat.

Great food, great service in a great environment accompanied the great companionship with my wife."}
{"text":"Me and my date stopped in last night and loved this place! The bartender was very professional and extremely friendly, he knew the menu and the drinks very well. The atmosphere and music was great. We had the BBQ shrimp, it was fabulous! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews and just had to go it was worth the walk great food and drinks.... :)"}
{"text":"We got lucky and were able to walk in and get a table- no reservations.  Having been to New Orleans, we were excited to get Gator as an appetizer.  It was every bit as good as what we got down south.  
Our food was delicious, and my husband discovered that he likes fava beans.  
The service was great as well. 
We will eat here again."}
{"text":"I love NOLA! From the drinks to the food to the ambiance. I went on August 17th and had a very enjoyable experience. Out waitress was very helpful and knowledge about the drinks they had including the different beers (I love trying new and different beers so this was very nice to have someone who knows). 
My friends ordered the oysters and the crab special. While they seemed like small plates for the price, they appeared as if they were well enjoyed. We were given one of the pizzas courtesy of the chef and I must say that it was one of the best crusts I have had since moving to Pittsburgh. I would order the crawfish and andouille sausage any time. 
For dinner, everyone at the table got the Steak et Frites. AMAZING! You can tell alot of care went into the food as the fries are well seasoned, the salad is perfectly dressed and the steak was tender and delicious. 
The crowd tended to be older but it was still a very nice atmosphere and I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Visited Nola for the first time in awhile and so glad I did!  We stopped by this afternoon between lunch and dinner. A great time to go because it wasn't too busy and we actually found parking in Market Square.  
We were promptly greeted by a personable hostess and seated quickly.  Our meal started with two appetizers, Fried Green Tomatoes and Potato Chip Crusted Catfish.  Both, so good! I am a true fan of southern food so I was quite happy to find fried green tomatoes - and done well! 
I selected the soup and sandwich duo which I felt was reasonably priced at $12.  I received a full cup of french onion soup, a turkey Cuban sandwich and french fries. Everything tasted great.  The soup broth was very flavorful and I liked the twist on the Cuban sandwich with the smoked turkey.  The fries were also tasty with a nice mix of seasoning on them.  
I wish we had saved room for dessert because everything sounded so delicious.  I think next time we'll just go for coffee and dessert to truly enjoy the experience. 
What impressed me most with our experience was the service.  Very quickly on we were told our waitress had a large table in another section but the service didn't suffer at all.  Everyone from the hostess, bartender, another waiter, even the Manager, stopped by to help our dinner service go seamlessly.  Our waitress was also just so sweet and really personable.  She was very informed as to the menu and also offered suggestions for coming back during Happy Hour.
NOLA has great ambiance too. I enjoyed the decor and music, everyone we encountered was very pleasant. Overall just a great experience!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing, the food was the best, and the mixed drinks were so yummy!   I have tried this place for the first time yesterday and plan on making it a regular of mine.  The waiter was so very nice and very helpful on what to choose based on our taste buds.  He knew alot about how the food was made and the history of the resturaunt.  I cant wait to go again and would really reccomend everyone try it.....you 2 will become a reguar!"}
{"text":"Authentic New Orleans fare in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. Informative server who was helpful with his thoughts on the menu, all choices were wonderful. The Jazz band was a wonderful backdrop to the evening."}
{"text":"My alligator bites were more like alligator crumbs. I had rice and beans which were serve lukewarm. My granddaughters fried green tomatoes tasted watery and were not crisp. A very diappointing experience. Would not go again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for NOLA.

My boyfriend's family lives in New Orleans, and we visit yearly.  When I first walked into NOLA, my first impression was that this is kind of like the Disney World version of New Orleans.  It is over the top, cliche, and kinda cheesy.  That's fine, I can deal with that.  Cheesy can be fun, and the music was great.  I tried to keep a positive attitude.

I ordered a Sazerac, a classic New Orleans cocktail, and it was served warm.  It was also very heavy on the absinthe rinse.  Friends have told me they've had great Sazeracs at NOLA, so I'm hoping this was a fluke.

Next, I tried the alligator appetizer.  It was pretty tasty, but the presentation was not great.  The tiny nuggets of fried alligator were dwarfed by the huge rectangular plate they were served on.  It just seemed like an interesting choice. The red beans and rice dish was pretty awesome, but it wasn't as good as those I've had on the Gulf Coast.  They weren't as thick and creamy, and they were lacking in spice (a bottle of hot sauce fixed that).  Overall, NOLA did not do justice to the awesomeness that is New Orleans cuisine.  

I love New Orleans, and I want to love NOLA.  I'll definitely give it a second try.

Some perks:  live music, $5 valet parking after 5 (for all of Market Square), good service, fun ambiance"}
{"text":"So glad I didn't spend $27 on shrimp and grits. Funny exchange on that. When I mentioned the high price, it was explained as being a function of the grits from NC. Yeah- me too, from NC and grits are poor people food!  The shrimp and sausage should be the money in the dish. So, I went salad and flatbread. Got out more cheaply but this place confirms my Market Square theory: you eat there to sit there -in the square- and not to actually eat a high quality meal."}
{"text":"New Orleans atmosphere with food to match considering it is so far removed from the real deal. BBQ shrimp, shrimp and grits, and gumbo were excellent. Red beans not cooked down enough in the red beans and rice dish.

Scotch and wine choices adequate. I will plan to return when my travels take me back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It's not Cajun food - what we had....oysters (how do you mess those up?), gator nuggets or whatever they call it, and the étouffée was awful. Awful. Étouffée was not even close. Better experience could be had at south hills village (local mall). Desert was decent......which is why it gets one star vs zero. Waitress was nice but literally could not open a bottle of wine. Pittsburgh deserves better - heck mall food courts throughout North America deserve better.  To say this place sucks is an insult to the word \"suck\". Go if you want to lie to yourself or if your  best dining experience includes a free cookie"}
{"text":"Went there on Wednesday after work for dinner and must say it was delicious.  We split the alligator, he had the gumbo (extra spicy), and I had the leak/brie pasta.

The alligator was disappointing not because of the tastes, it was extremely delicious.  It tasted like a mix of chicken and calamari with a spicy seasoning.  Heavily breaded and heavily spices.  The sauce that came with it tasted almost like the onion petal sauce from the Outback.   However it was so small and it came on a long plate.  There were 12 small pieces of it.  There was more sauce than alligator and it was $13!  Never again.  

His gumbo wasn't particularly spicy and it had too much tomato sauce but it was close to New Orlans.  Can't complain too much considering how far away we are.  My pasta was extra saucy and small.  The dish it came on was huge too.  Why the excessive presentation?

Biggest complaints?  No po'boys, no ghost peppers, and no jazz through the speakers!  Plus the decor looked as if they were getting ready for Mardi Gras.  Nice artwork though and the waiter was a sweetheart (thanks Miles!).  He was attentive and polite.  

All in all I probably will not go back for dinner.  Granted we tipped Miles well the cost was just excessive for how little we got.  Will try again for lunch one day."}
{"text":"What an incredible  jambalaya! Best I've ever had. Service was good  atmosphere comfortable, and priced right. The entire menu was terrific."}
{"text":"What an amazing New Orleans experience! The decor was phenomenal and the live band set it off! The Nola truly captures the Bourbon Street ambiance! Our waitress Cassandra was phenomenal in her menu expertise. Our party included a small child and our waitress was very accommodating to her needs putting a rush on her food and bringing her crackers while we waited. The Drink menu has a great selection of craft beers and speciality drink. The menu is traditional New Orleans  . I highly recommend the frog leg appetizer it was exquisite. I have ate them from many establishments and these were by far the best! I truly enjoyed my experience and felt like I was in the French Quarters!"}
{"text":"I eat there over a year ago and it was very disappointing and since have had 2 friends eat there and felt the same. I guess my evening was not a fluke."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable experience on market square.  Loved the live music and atmosphere. For the food we got po boys and pizza.  All excellent. Will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"On a Thursday evening, without a reservation we tried to get a table here.  The hostess was very welcoming so we waited and scored an awesome table outdoors!!!  We enjoyed the glorious evening - the music was at a conversational level.  The server (and I'm mortified I didn't catch her name but she is expecting) was warm and engaging.  She had us trying alligator (+++) and was spot on with her individual recommendations to us."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I couldn't give this place 5 stars because of the 2 bartenders..
Especially the blonde girl bartender..terrible attitude , rude and slow
I ordered a Stella draft which tasted flat and water down..when I told her the beer was no good she took it to the manager who took a sip and they both looked at me like I was crazy..never came back n apologized just asked what other beer I would like..every time I finished a beer they would take the bottle n not ask if I would like another one or I would have to wave my hand to get another beer because they all stood at the end of the bar talking instead of taking care of the 3 ppl sitting at the bar..shout out to the chef and the server who brought my meal to me at the bar they both did a great job"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I had tried a few times for lunch but never was able to get a table. 

A client took us here for dinner. We sat in the back room and it was empty. We had the entire back room to ourselves. I did like being so close to the kitchen. 

We started with the fried alligator. It was good and would have again. 

I had the jambalaya. It came out steaming hot that I could barely eat it. It had a nice variety of seafood in it. It had two large scallops, a few grilled shrimp, a few pieces of chicken and a good red sauce that had a little heat. 

I nearly finished the entire plate. 

Nice to try a new place and really liked the new place. 

Service was fast and friendly with some southern charm."}
{"text":"Good quality food, not necessarily authentic New Orleans food, but very tasty. Slow service. Nice ambience. Very clean. Would go back!"}
{"text":"I love creole, I know creole, I cook creole myself.

So I was beyond excited to try this place, and thrilled to see this style of cooking introduced to Pittsburgh. 

It didn't stand up to my standards, I guess if you don't know creole food it can pass for a poor imitation.

It simply lacked heart, which for me, is everything with this style of cuisine.

I found the atmosphere tacky and cliche.

Our server was well-trained, but again lacked heart and personality.

An overall corporate feel, when to do a true cajun/creole menu you need soul."}
{"text":"Before I dive into the negatives, let me say that the entire staff was friendly and accommodating. I had absolutely no qualms about the service. 

This used to be one of my favorite lunch/dinner spots for memorable and delicious cuisine. However; ever since the menu/head chef was changed, the menu appears to have nose dived. The frog leg appetizer portion has been cut in half and covered in an unnecessary sauce. The soup cups were so shallow, I only got a thimble's worth of broth. Lastly, my pulled pork sandwich was 60% un-chewable fat. I had noticed that the appetizers were lacking during a recent happy hour, and I had written it off as a one-time fluke. Sadly, it appears that the menu quality as a whole is not what it used to be. Can't say I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Wow does this place have awful service. Waitress only came over to take orders and give us food, never to check up on us. We were sitting right next to the kitchen and could see all the employees standing around not doing anything. It took them 30 minutes to make a side salad! Even if food is made to order, it shouldn't take an hour to make a waffle. No apologies for the wait either. Also, when the waitress brought the food, she unceremoniously dumped it on the table without a word. No drink refills either as she seemed to be hiding from us in the bar area. Food was ok, but pricey and a bit heavy on the salt. Would not return."}
{"text":"I love Southern food, especially from New Orleans so of course we had to give this place a shot.  Definitely a great place for appetizers and lunch, but I think we should of ordered different items for dinner, wasn't pleased but definitely l wasn't displeased.   For what we paid I think we should of gotten more, but to each their own.   I suggest avoiding this place if you see a large group present too.  Overall though we were happy and probably will try it again, but for lunch only.  The service was definitely great here though,  the employees definitely had their knowledge on the food they offer."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out NOLA a few weeks back with a group of friends. I made a reservation in advance however we still waited 30 minutes to be seated.  If we had been seated quicker I would give NOLA  5 stars.

We started with the alligator. Very good and something new for all of us.  I got the Nola Salad and it was delicious. My friend got the Scallops Mac Daddy and really enjoyed it. Another got the blackened red fish and said it was great.  Our waitress was extremely friendly. 

We were seated towards the back and could see the kitchen which was neat as well. Overall a good atmosphere. The place was packed and everyone appeared to be having a good time."}
{"text":"8 of my coworkers and I came to this swanky bar while training in Pittsburgh for the week. We had explored a lot of the city at this point, and had enjoyed several great restaurants and bars. Nola took the cake. 

The place was beautiful. Different. Alive and cozy at the same time. 

Everyone's food was delicious. 

The cocktail list was to die for! I had the New Orleans Milk Punch, which I still talk about, and one of the hot drinks a bartender had recommended. I forget the name, but I believe it had: Brandy, Grand Marnier, Cacao, Cinnamon, and Butter?! It was fantastic.

The servers and bartenders were wonderful and kind. 

And the manager was dressed to the nines when he came by our table to check on us and thank us for coming in. 

We return to Pittsburgh the first week of December. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now for lunch during the week and it is completely hit or miss.  I've gotten food lunch that I just love and crave and then the next time I come it's terrible. 

My \"new\" biggest beef with this place is that on one visit the server helped himself by upping my tip.  I pay with a credit card and I always tip 20%, I round up for good service and may round down for poor service but never less than 15%.   I had gotten the lunch combo which is around $12, so with tax and tip the total was $16.  My credit card statement showed over $22.   I brought it in the next time I went to eat there to discuss with the manager and he didn't apologize at all and said he couldn't refund me the difference but today's meal would be free.  Which was a little bit more than what I was owed.  The fact that he never said that he was sorry it happened just really irked me. 

The fact that the food quality is so inconsistent and that someone on the wait staff stole from me means I will never go back."}
{"text":"Def not authentic New Orleans style food. We had their Bloody Mary, which tasted like Tabasco sauce. Their gumbo and shrimp and grits tasted like someone from up north make the recipe. Upset as we were looking forward to having authentic Cajun food. We will not return back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  We were seated quickly, and the service was awesome.  They have a fine wine list, and will let you sample different wines so you can choose one you like.  Their usual jazz band was playing as well, and while it did make the atmosphere a bit more noisy, the music was very good.  The food was pretty good-- I had the fish special and my companion and I shared the fried alligator appetizer (which I recommend).  I also recommend the St. Charles cocktail (which is basically a dressed-up gin and tonic).  All in all, very pleasant.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great experience at Nola on the Square!  Our server, Kathryn, was impeccable!  Her suggestions for food wand wine were spot on especially since she carefully listened to our food preferences...my wife being more of a fine french foodie and I a spicy buff.  

The crawfish & sherry soup was tasty, more of a bisque with chunks of crawfish.  I had the fried gator tail.  Panko breaded chunks of tail with a beautiful creamy, but spicy sauce - the meat was fresh and sweet.  

For our entrees we had the Scallops Mac Daddy - Beautifully prepared and the scallops were huge and perfectly done. I had the wood roasted quail. Two complete quail that were again perfectly done although my wife thought just a  tad over salted."}
{"text":"My first visit to NOLA was mediocre, my second visit, during lunch, was unexpectedly pleasant. My review here covers my second experience.

All 3 people in my party had the half sandwich/half salad/voodoo fries combination or a variation thereof.

Veggie lovers take note: The salad with watermelon and arugula was delicious! I really liked my smoked turkey Cuban (a little heavy on the meat), and the voodoo fries are good. My companions would recommend NOLA's jambalaya as well.

For $12 each, our meals were good and the price point is VERY competitive among the other restaurants serving the downtown lunch crowd. I will be back!"}
{"text":"So, just......not great. At all. Was our second try with this place. We ordered apps for the table, didn't get plates to eat them on. Waited a full five minutes for the server to come after a food runner delivered apps, he never showed. Had to get up and go looking for him so we could have some plates.  Server took our silverware after we finished the appetizers, didn't give us new. Had to take them from a neighboring table because he went MIA again. The menu is heavily overpriced, the food is nice but definitely not worth the prices. Disappointing in that regard.  This place could be really fun and cool, it's trying so hard to be upscale and it's just so not. It's a Cajun/creole place, to me them atmosphere should be all about that. Fun, good zydeco music.....something?? Service was poor at best. We won't be back, too many great places downtown to eat that get it. We wanted to like it!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. After reading other reviews I was hesitant. The service was razor sharp, no empty glasses, no plates laying around, nobody waiting for more liquor. 

I ordered the fried alligator appetizer , gumbo soup and jumbalia for dinner. If you haven't tried alligator, do yourself a favor and do. Great dish with smoky thousand island dressing sauce. 

The gumbo soup was spicy and hearty. I'm going to look into making my own for cold winter nights after this experience.

The scallops and shrimp in the jumbalia were very well cooked, it as well was served (physically) HOT and spicy, it was everything I could ask for. When I asked for the hottest hot sauce they had, it was delivered. Not just Franks Red Hot like I'm normally served. It was a unique brand of fire death. Perfect.

Overpriced yeah. But I left with a new taste for cajun cooking. I did not want to rate this establishment 5 stars, but I had too."}
{"text":"Good shrimp and grits, po boys, and gumbo. A few unique twists on classic drinks, decent beer selection, and great service."}
{"text":"being from both new orleans and cajun country, i go into restaurants outside of louisiana who offer louisiana food with very low expectations.  that being said, my rating for nola is a combination of the atmosphere, service, food and especially abita on tap (which i totally appreciate).  

i had the red beans and rice which wasn't bad - it needed more flavor and heat but is made correctly with the bean paste.  i also had the abita battered shrimp which comes with a pepper sauce - not bad but it's better for the heat to be part of the batter rather than the cooked shrimp sprinkled with chili powder.  also, the cole slaw was not good.  finally, we had the griddle grits which was ok.  the flavor was strange at first but it grows on you.  the presentation of all the food was nice, but $11 for a few shrimp and $17 for grits is overpriced.

the service was attentive and good.  the kind of music played was spot on.  finally, one recommendation would be to put hot sauce on the tables, which is standard in louisiana and needed for what was served."}
{"text":"I love NOLA! I have food allergies. They were super nice and accommodating with that. I brought friends back and then returned again.. so 3-4 times I've left Nola feeling happy and excited to go back."}
{"text":"I tried this for lunch, the atmosphere is pretty good with inside seating and outside on the square. The service was fine and the lunch combo was a good amount of food for the money. I ordered the gumbo and roast beef poboy which also came with fries. I found both the gumbo and sandwich were way too salty, to the point where I didn't finish either and had a salt aftertaste all afternoon. The fries were probably the best part. 

I may try NOLA again, but would try something else from the menu. Unfortunately these two New Orleans staples did not deliver."}
{"text":"I love NOLA. If it were less expensive I would eat here all the time. Alas, it is on Market Square so the menu prices are high. I've eaten dinner here twice and also came once for brunch. The first time I was here was for a pre-theater dinner. We were seated in the dining room next to the windows into the kitchen so I could watch all the food being prepared. I've read reviews claiming that the jambalaya must be pre-made and frozen. It isn't. I watched a chef make it to order and put it in the brick oven. The second time we were seated in the dining area in the front room near the bar, and the third time I ate at the bar. Thus far I've had grit cakes, shrimp and grits, fried green tomatoes, seafood soup, and beignets. As far as I can tell this is the only place in Pittsburgh that serves beignets. They aren't quite as good as the ones in New Orleans, but they are a pretty good approximation. The food is well prepared and (as the server told us on my first trip there) adapted spice-wise to Pittsburgh, meaning that the Cajun/Creole flavors have been toned down a bit. They will give you hot sauce upon request to spice the food up. As far as drinks go, they have a pretty nice wine list. I had a couple of cocktails when I was there for brunch and I wasn't blown away by them. They seemed a little weak. Also, the service here is hit or miss. They sometimes seem a little disorganized in terms of who is handling which tables. I can live with that though since the food is so good and the atmosphere at the bar is so much fun."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Ordered a Shrimp Po'Boy with Cajun fries and Jumbalaya -- both were very good and flavorful. Portions were perfect sizes for lunch, we didn't feel overly full afterwards. The waitress was nice and attentive and even had a suggestion of dipping my fries in the hot sauce as an alternative to ketchup. I would most likely go back again if I had a craving for some NOLA food!"}
{"text":"Its nice to see a Louisiana style place open in Pittsburgn and the location is great.. However, after just being to New Orleans and coming here I can say its not really comparable to a nice restaurant down there. Food is pretty overpriced and just doesn't taste quite right. Service was pretty good, and its a big restaurant with free valet parking. Its decorated tastefully too."}
{"text":"The servers are really nice. I came during happy hour and ordered the red beans and rice ($1) and the Catfish Fingers ($3)

1st- the beans had the right flavor (being from New Orleans I grew up on this dish) but the beans were not cooked all the way. I do feel sorry for my intestines when they have to break them down. They were way harder than canned beans, and need 30more mins in the pot

The fish was pleasing, I love the presentation of both dishes. I would love to give this more than 2 stars but I know that they should do way better. I'm no chief but I know good cooked food when I taste it. 

I did let the server know about the bean and she was very understanding. Feedback is always the key!"}
{"text":"We've dined here a few times now. I've only been disappointed once as they ran out of oysters. I'm looking forward to lunch as they have a few New Orleans classics which are not on the dinner menu (that is a mistake in my opinion)."}
{"text":"We ate there on a Tuesday night,  and received excellent service.  I had the steak and salad.  The steak was very good for the price.  ($25) overall nice dinning ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm from the Gulf Coast and grew up a stones throw from New Orleans. My step-dad is no-shit Cajun. So, I have high standards. 

Went for Sunday brunch. This is the run down:
+ Breakfast grits: ok but I would've liked to have tried them as described on the menu. They were out of peaches. 
- Gumbo: too mild for authentic gumbo. 
+ Fried Green Tomatoes: really good, but I would've opted for remoulade instead of ranch. 
+ Bloody Mary bar: nice touch but it would've been nice to have toothpicks for the olives and pickles and such. 
- Strawberry Shortcake Waffles: good but too spongy. 
+ Beignets and coffee: the beignets were really good but a little small. I'm used to Cafe du Monde where the beignets are pretty big. But these stood up in taste. The coffee was a little weak. 
- Chicory coffee: iced chicory coffee? Wtf? In my humble opinion, chicory coffee should never be iced. 

Other than that, the service was a little slow but things were good. I'll have to come back and try them for lunch or dinner and see how they really stack up."}
{"text":"Wow great choice on a very warm Friday night , got a table outside on market square and enjoyed the surroundings ,I ordered the seafood Mac Daddy .it was over the top ,the lobster and shrimp were done to perfection ,I highly recommend ,so give em a try ."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here! Fried gator app is amazing! Had several entrees- scallops Mac daddy, seafood jambalaya, and catfish all where great!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, staff was friendly and courteous and overall just a great place. Never been here before but glad we took the chance - will definitely be back again! 

We recommend the shrimp po' boy, voodoo fries, and red beans and rice. All were seasoned and cooked to perfection - best food I've had in Pittsburgh so far! Dessert, anyone? The bourbon ball is absolutely amazing - not too sweet and not too much - perfect way to end the meal! Thank you for everything!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place sooner. It was a welcome surprise to find. Being a Louisiana native now living in Pittsburgh, you rarely find any cajun food anywhere and if you do, it's not what it should be. 

Everything I had was delicious, the chef was more than helpful with preparing an item I had requested and then just went ahead with making the entire meal an amazingly delicious experience that reminded me of home. 

The bartender did make the oddest version of a Hurricane I had ever had. I don't think that particular person knew what they were doing, but my review is for the food, not the bar. 

My only other complaint, would be that the waitress didn't seem to know much about the food. She served my husband and I a tasting of etouffee, but never brought the rice to go with it and had not come back to check on us so we just had a few bites of it by itself. It was good, just not served properly. Being in the service industry myself, it really makes me a lil picky about how I get treated when I dine out, and I was turned off that a place this unique to this area, where especially most people here don't know this type of food, should have servers who know what they are serving."}
{"text":"A little taste of Creole! Enjoyed the oyster poboy although it was a bit expensive- $15! Fries with Cajun seasoning were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Fantastic food, service, cocktails &  music! We were seated earlier than our reservation. I think our servers name was Al. He was out of this world. We had: fried green tomatoes, alligator, shrimp & grits and jumbalaya. Then beignet and creme brulè fantastic!! ."}
{"text":"I enjoy the city of Pittsburgh. And I enjoy trying new things. 

So suffice it to say, I was happy to combine those two things this when my wife and I and two friends were hanging out in Market Square and PPG Place the Saturday of Light-Up Weekend. One of them suggested Nola, as she had eaten there once before. Since we hadn't, we went along. 

I've been to New Orleans, and the first thing I noticed walking in: the place smelled a lot like that city. That was a good thing. Also a good thing: our timing. We were told that normally on a Saturday night, there would be a lengthy wait for a table, but since we had beaten the dinner rush, we only waited about ten minutes. 

Once we were seated, a lovely lady named Mariah was our server. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and even when she wasn't sure about what that day's specials were, she let us know that she'd get us that information: which she did - and I was glad, as I wound up ordering the fried chicken, which was different from any I had ever had before and very good. It had a sweetness to it and a bit of a kick - much like the aioli that came with crispy fried alligator, which, along with the frog legs we ordered and the fried green tomatoes made for great appetizers (and I don't even like tomatoes). 

I didn't try the flatbread, but it got rave reviews from my friends and my wife, who did. At the end of the evening, a manager came up and asked us how we liked the fried chicken, as they were experimenting with it and wanted a customer's opinion. At that point, I hadn't tried it, but my wife had and she assured him that it was very good (something I'd find out later). 

For drinks, we kept it pretty simple, though my wife did enjoy the Canyon Oaks Cabernet. 

We didn't wind up getting dessert, because we were very full. Too bad, because I imagine that they make a great beignet. 

All in all, it was a very good dining experience. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Hard to knock this place.... Ok it's not New Orleans ..but the drinks are good, the food great and the music awesome....gumbo is delish, flavor profile on the pork great , and bread pudding yummy.   oh yeah the service was on point...."}
{"text":"We tried this place because it looked good. I will say, it was good. The menu sounded delicious. The prices were decent. I can't complain about that. However, as I sat down and had my glass of wine, I started to see gnats flying about. They got worse for some reason. When my food arrived, I was swarmed by them to the point I couldn't eat. We asked to be moved and since it was packed they just moved us to a different table, still outside. I could not eat my food because of the gnats. I know they can't help the outdoor elements, but I mean, seriously a big issue I had to leave the restaurant, my wine glass ended up with 3 gnats floating inside it. It was gross."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and get the alligator. No it is not \"kinda like chicken.\" It's a different taste, a different texture and whole lot of goodness. The sauce drizzled on the lightly battered, crispy pieces of alligator tail meat has the right amount of kick to make you close your eyes and go, \"yummmm\" and secretly wish that your dinner buddies that you are sharing this with would disagree and not eat a lot of the crunchy, fried alligator bites and so you can devour them all. 
Well, that ain't happening! It is THAT good!
I got the quail as dinner. I didn't want a piece of blackened fish or something that I could make myself! So quail it was! The bed of wild rice and oyster dressing is delicious. The quail itself is juicy with a crispy skin. 
One of my friends raved about the gumbo. Another had the cornmeal crusted tilapia (special) of the night. The cooking here is done very very well. The cornmeal crust is just perfect, crusty, yet juicy fish on the inside.
The experience is truly great and kinda unique. The bar is crazy busy, the seating area is vibrant with people of all ages enjoying their food. A happy crowd is always a sign of a great restaurant.

The portions here are more on the Pittsburgh portion side. The place has valet parking, I didn't know about it until I parked, so don't know the details. There are quite a few garages around Nola."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Today was my first time at Nola today, and I will definitely go again. I had the Grilled Chicken Panini with the fries. The fries were incredibly good! The panini was yum too. 

The only problem with this place is that the service is ridiculously slow. It has been a while since I waited 30 minutes after I ordered to have my food served. I don`t know if it is because it was a lunch time during a weekday, or if it is their usual routine. But I would recommend carving time on your calendar longer than the usual if you would like to go this place during the week and sit down to enjoy your lunch. 

Highly recommend it - will try the drinks next time which I heard are also really good!"}
{"text":"$40 for a cup of Gumbo, Jambalaya, a Pepsi, and tip. Very, very spicy, to the point of overwhelming any flavor. Jambalaya was a bit salty and greasy, with dried out chicken, definitely not worth $23. I won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had a very short baby sitting window to grab a few bites and drinks. After stopping next door at Sienna for a drink and app we decided to head over to NOLA next.
I have been there once before a few years ago with a girlfriend and I had the best oyster stew I have ever had. That is why I gave a two star review. Unfortunately this time we didn't get to try anything to eat. 
We sat ourselves at the bar after alerting the host that we were there for a drink and an app. It seemed fairly busy. Not crazy, but decently busy. We sat and waited for anyone to acknowledge our arrival. Down the bar we saw a barback polishing glasses. A couple employees farther down chatting it up with each other. So we decided to give it a few minutes before making any rational decisions. 
Another minute or so goes by. The manager walks right by us with glasses without even looking at us or any of the other guests at the bar. At this point we realize that we think there is only one bartender for the whole 20 person bar. My thing is if you only have one bartender and barback maybe help your employees out a little bit? 
So another couple minutes go by. We decide to give it another 60 seconds. And alas, nothing. So we missed out on our stew and drink we were looking forward to and decided to get up and leave. 
I don't know if anyone noticed the two people sitting at the bar got up and left. I honestly hope they did. We are both in the restaurant/bar industry and the first thing you do when you are in the weeds is at least aknowledge to new guests that you will be with them shortly. We may have been more forgiving if someone at least said hello to us. 
Maybe one day we will try to include NOLA into our downtown restaurant hop date-night again. But probably not in the near future."}
{"text":"Great Cajun food and good service. The waiter was able to answer all our questions and provided awesome recommendations. I had the Blackened Red Fish (Red Beans & Rice with Blackened White Fish and Coleslaw) and my friend had the Jambalaya. Both dishes I recommend trying. They were awesome. We had the fried alligator for a appetizer. A little tough and chewy. I guess it was good, never had alligator before--Just had to try it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food.  Only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the fact that they didn't serve bread or rolls and the time between our appetizers and dinners was a little long.  I had shrimp and grits and it was absolutely awesome!  My husband had a Mac Daddy pasta dish that was chockfull of seafood, my son had the jambalaya, also full of seafood.  My other son said his peach cobbler was the best he ever ate!  Food portions were large, we all had a doggie bag for home.  Everything was perfectly seasoned, felt as if we were eating cajun food from they bayou!  Bar area noisy, we ate in the dining area--quite nice!"}
{"text":"The dinner preparation was excellent, unfortunately service was flawed. Our utensils were not cleared between courses, and unbelievably the server handled our utensils during the meal. Perhaps Tuesday night was training night, but the poor service cannot be forgiven easily"}
{"text":"We couldn't resist stopping in at this place. The outside eating area is small and can get somewhat uncomfortable when many people are waiting to find a seat. This is made up for by the amazing band that was playing and the general ambiance of market square. Many people stopped to take pictures of the restaurant, patio, and band. This restaurant really adds to the market square environment. 

We were told to grab any open seat on the patio since the indoor seating area was unavailable due to our lack of a reservation. This did not bother us and they were polite. The draft beer selection was good and their \"house\" IPA was decent. The alligator starter is crispy and smothered in a zesty sauce. Good stuff! The pork chop was huge and worth the price. Overall we loved this place due to the good food, service, and environment. Check it out while it is still warm."}
{"text":"I've been to Nola a few times over the years and it's always been enjoyable. They must be under new management now because the drinks and the service were terrible. We saw one female manager  who either sat at a table watching tv or was yelling at the servers who all seemed like they had no idea what they were doing. It was very uncomfortable. Also who doesn't have luxadaro or amarena for an old fashioned?! Very disappointed about the drinks and the price we paid for them"}
{"text":"The main entrees at Nola are great and consistently tasty!! However, the desserts are absolutely terrible!!! The creme brûlée is more like a cake, the bananas foster taste like brown sugar, and the cream on top was a tasteless blob of goo! Where are the bananas?? I definitely recommend Nola's for their great main courses, however the owner needs to look elsewhere for a real dessert/pastry chef or get them further training perhaps!! Eat at Nola's but save your $$$ on dessert pick this up elsewhere (dunkin doughnuts next door would be better)!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Had a daily special of duck with butternut squash and some pasta. The duck was a little over spiced, but made up for hte pasta being under spiced. Added a little salt to help. 

The service was a little slow, but the rest of the evening was good. Servers were very freindly, Price was a little steep. Overall, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Made an impromptu visit to this restaurant, glad I did. The coffee was nice and hot, fresh. We sat on the patio while eating our brunch. I had a simple meal with breakfast potatoes and eggs (don't remember the name of the dish), I asked for mild seasoning and they did it just right. My boyfriend had a voodoo Mary and he says it was fair. Overall good experience, would want to experience dinner here."}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD AND DRINKS WITH FRIENDS

I came here on a week night, even on the week night it was a little loud.  This wasn't an issue for my friends and I.  We had several drinks (good Hurricanes) and some small bites of food.  The French Onion soup was very good, a little too salty but very flavorful overall.  The baked oysters were very good overall.  

Our waiter (Shane) was very good and helped us learn more about Pittsburgh and the surrounding area.

It's not the best place for an intimate dinner, however a great place for drinks and food with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Great Waldorf salad awesome blue cheese dressing. Shrimp and scallop Mac and cheese was incredible. Wife had shrimp and grits creamy grits tons of flavor"}
{"text":"WOW... granite I have not been to Nola's in about a year. We went there over the weekend just because I have always loved their fried shrimp. They limited their menu to absolutely nothing. Fried shrimp was taken off. No biggy, although for a New Orleans based restaurant, how can you not have fried shrimp. Thats ok, I ordered the craw-fish... waitress said, I am sorry, we are out of craw-fish. Again New Orleans based restaurant without shrimp nor craw-fish. I then ordered the pulled pork sandwich that stated it came with onion rings on top, literally, one onion ring. The sandwich was cold, the bun was hard. Ohhh and when I tried to go healthier with fruit cup. Sorry, we are out of fruit cup, I went with the fries, please change your oil more then once every six months please. We also ordered the Gumbo and flatbread. Those were not to bad, but we had to ask for silverware and napkins. The restaurant was not crowded at all, there was no reason why we needed to ask for utensils. So disappointed. Please try another restaurant before stopping here. I don't know if you are under new management, but please get it together."}
{"text":"I just had lunch there-Oyster stew and NOLA salad. Also ordered Fried Green Tomatoes which they forgot. They oyster stew was sooo salty it tasted an entire shaker of salt was dumped the pot.  It would have been really good otherwise.  We mentioned to the waitress who said everyone has been complaining all week and that is how it is supposed to taste because of the seafood.  I'm sure the chef did not try this prior to serving. I can't understand why after several complaints they would keep serving and not address this.  They were also out of the Mufaletta sandwich which is a New Orleans staple.  They need to hire some better chefs and waitresses apparently."}
{"text":"Maybe some of the worst food and service I've ever had...anywhere. I think our server had never ever even eaten in a restaurant before starting work at Nola. We were there for almost two hours since it took  so long for food and she came to out table three times.  We had to ask the manager where our food was after an hour.  It was a Sunday and the restaurant was about a third full. The 'bone-in' short ribs was a fatty pot roast (literally sitting in a clear pool of fat on my platter) there were no bones or flavor.  The grits had a dried layer on top from sitting under a heat lamp. I used to frequent Nola when it opened. It was great and I don't know what happened."}
{"text":"Nola never disappoints! I've been three times in the past 6 months and it's always just so yummy. The service is wonderful and it's affordable.  I don't so much like the decor. It feels dated somehow, but that's just personal taste. Try the red beans and rice! To die for!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE..Woodfired flatbread pizza, sausage and crawfish. Not a flatbread just pizza dough that was very flimsy. Way too much cheese. Crawfish disgusting, fishy flavor. Sausage ok. Also had gator app. Best part was the creole sauce. Plates were dirty. Nola is a nogo"}
{"text":"NOLA was ok, but I probably won't be back. Two of us dined --One really enjoyed the Mac daddy (seafood Mac n cheese).  The other didn't eat the tomato mozz flat bread (it was very soggy and oily). Server Cory was awesome, really above average. The atmosphere was ruined by the fact that it was absolutely freezing. Like cover your arms with napkins freezing!!  Other guests were complaining about the temp, too."}
{"text":"New Orleans in Pittsburgh! Ate here on a Saturday evening early. No happy hour on the weekends. We opted for the outdoor seating as it was a beautiful day. The menu selection is limited and pricey. We got the gumbo and the Mahi-mahi special entree. For the price it should have included a salad or at least bread. Food was tasty but the meal should have included more for the price. Service was great. There was no wait. We walked so parking was not an issue for us. There were"}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed.  The food was just ok.  We had to ask for bread.  The salad was too 'tart' - a lot of oil.  The pasta that I had was just ok -- nothing to write home about.  The drinks were good.  I was disappointed in the peach cobbler.  The renovations are nice though.  We could see the kitchen from our table and that was nice even though my husband wanted the chef to start yelling.  I'm not sure I would go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I have visited NOLA on two different occasions. 

The first was a very casual afternoon when we had been out and about exploring downtown Pittsburgh. We sat outside (a great location for people watching in the square, by the way) and enjoyed a couple of drinks and a sampling of appetizers. Everything we had was wonderful - including the service!

Our second visit was on Easter Sunday. We had a party of 5 and were assigned to a table in the back part of the restaurant that was being overseen by William (I'll get back to him later). 

First off, I will say that this restaurant has 3 unique seating areas to choose from based upon your mood. As I mentioned earlier, the outdoor seating area had a very nice café feel with a great view of Market Square. Then there is the bar section, where various televisions were broadcasting sports programs while jazz music played in the background. It had a very fun, New Orleans feel to it. This particular location seemed to be a pretty happening area for people in their 20s & 30s given the loud music and sporting event coverage. The place that we were seated was located in the back of the restaurant. It was quieter and had much more of an upscale feeling than the front two sections. This was perfect for us as we had just come from a theater production and were anxious to discuss the details of the play. The kitchen, which is located in this area, was open and visible to us, although we were not bothered at all by the noise level. They workers seemed to be very conscientious of keeping it that way. The food was fabulous and so was the service - which brings me back to William. 

William, our waiter, was AMAZING! Not only was he extremely familiar with the menu and the available specials, but he made sure that each one of us had his individualized attention as we were ordering. Each of us had different tastes which he personally evaluated before offering suggestions of those dishes he thought matched those qualifications. We all loved the selections we had made thanks to his input. Also, many times waiters and waitresses can tend to be over attentive, in that they strive to make sure that their customers' every need is met. This, however, can become a bit complicated when you have a group involved in deep discussion. It took a lot of though and insight on his part to know what times were best for him to step in and which times were better for him to quietly remain available in the background. Somehow, William managed to juggle this task in the most efficient and least-intrusive way possible. Although he never interrupted a conversation or thought, he made sure that he took care of all of our needs including drink refills and plate clearing with almost no notice of his presence. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant. Service and food are fabulous...and make sure to request William if you want superior service. Way to go, William!"}
{"text":"Live music in any atmosphere adds to the ambience. Service was really fast and the the waiter was super polite, knowledgeable and helpful in helping me choose items from the menu. I had the fried alligator which was delicious but small for the price. For my main course I opted for the shrimp and grits. Mind you I hate anything with grits as an accompaniment and I was truly surprised at how good the food was. I emptied my plate needless to say. I definitely recommended this place on a Saturday night with friends. It's a very relaxed and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic! We had the pizza, amazing! My husband had the Roast beef, it wasn't what he expected and they happily replaced it for the turkey! So nice! The fries are what stole the show! Really, you must try!"}
{"text":"Very salty and not what I expected. Was sat down and had to ask for silverware when food arrived. Needs improvements."}
{"text":"Food is great!  But....Server...no personality...forgot item on order.....had to flag someone down for drink refills...Thursday night... not crowded ..disappointing customer service."}
{"text":"Worst place waited more than an hour and now she is saying it will take at least 30 more mins to get to your order, ridicules make sure u only sit people u can serve and don't waste people's time, never going back and will highly non recommend. Professional behavior is a minimal trait expected from any business, specially the ones dependent on customers. We are leaving the restaurants after sitting here for 1 hour 20 mins without food."}
{"text":"Perfectly balanced Creole cooking. Just the right amount of heat and spice but never overwhelming. Great beer list too. Service was good - not intrusive or forgetful. It was a bit noisy in the front of the restaurant so ask to be seated in the back. The fruit flies were a bit irritating. Otherwise, of was a great experience."}
{"text":"Yay for Team Nola! 

By that I specifically mean Jackie the event coordintor, Jen the mgr, Joyce and Matt for service. I live in Atlanta and theyhelped me execute my Dad's 75th bday party last weekend even while planning from a remote location! 

We used the speakeasy upstairs and It wasan event for 30 close friends and family.  The setup was awsome, service was fun and lively, food reviews were very good. 

Our menu consisted of Crab cakes and Fried green tomatoes, Crab Bisque, Salad, Lemon Catfish, the Filet, and the Pasta. Everyone loved the fish and the filet. The pasta was a little spicey for most to finish but they still said it was good. 

As far as the service, Joyce and Matt were AMAZING and formed great connections with my hostess crew. They also helped us transform the room to a true harlem rennesance type of look and made our set up and breakdown smooth and easy. We brought, in our own desserts bar and Nola supported with brining out the birthday cake. We had music in room and people could flow downstairs for the live music if they chose. Lukily we were fun enought that no one did. :-) 

I do wish they had free wii fi to facilitate the music but that was a minor issue since I have a mobile hotspot. 

Overall I'm very excited at the end results and truely appreciate Jackie, Jen, Joyce, and Matt for helping me give Daddy an awsome memory! Go team Nola!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews about NOLA. I experienced much of what was reflected in other reviews. My 4 star rating comes mostly from the overpriced food, and generic desire to provide customer service to us as I will explain.

A group of us (6) made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night.  We arrived early and had a drink at the bar after we checked in with the hostess. 8:45pm came and went and at around 9:05 we began to wonder why we haven't been seated yet. Finally around 9:30 we finally sat down. A whole 45 minutes past our reservation time, I find this unacceptable because there where numerous open tables on the other side of the restaurant. Also the management and staff constantly asked us if we were doing good and having fun etc. I find this approach to be like walking into a department store and someone is breathing down your neck. When I made the correlation that their approach was generic was when the waitress spilled my wife's glass of wine on the table. Rather than simply asking \"what kind of wine she had,\" and replacing it with a full glass. She actually asked how much was left in the glass and brought her another glass that was approximately a half serving of wine. Slightly tacky in my opinion. It really seemed as if they could have used more waitstaff for the dinning room.

The food was pretty good but I seriously believe that it was a little bit on the high $ side. I also thought that their menu was lacking some other staple Cajun dishes such as etouffee, boudin, boiled crawfish. Although they did have frog legs on the menu which I tried, have to say they were good. And alligator. I did think that it was weird that they did have things on the menu labeled as Cajun like Salmon??? I also tried the shrimp and grits and scallops Mac Daddy. I thought that the shrimp and grits while flavorful did not have the correct consistency of true grits. I also thought that this dish represented more of a \"Southern style cooking\" rather than New Orleans / Cajun.  And for $26 which I knew was high in the first place. The scallops Mac daddy was definitely the Mac Daddy. Very good rich dish with perfectly cooked scallops."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and did not have to wait at all. There was live jazz but I was glad to not be seated near the bar- it would have been way too loud for any conversation.
We started with a rum/milk/chocolate cocktail which was good but strong. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. We kicked off our meal with a starter of fried shrimp and it was just fantastic. The portion size was good and the hot pepper jelly was a great complement  to the flavors. We followed it up with grilled catfish. It was cooked perfectly. I am not a big fan of mashed potatoes and opted to add some hot sauce to the dish. We were offered a selection of 7-8 hot sauces. Loved it!
The dessert selection didn't tempt us much and there weren't too many choices for vegetarians. But it's a nice place and we might go back to try the other fish choices."}
{"text":"Ate at NOLA last night. I tried the alligator bites and crawfish flatbread for appetizers. Both were pretty good. I had the Duck Mac Daddy for the main course. It was absolutely delicious. Probably one of the best meals I've eaten. Highly recommended!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best french onion soup around.  Lunch prices are affordable and this is a cuisine unique to downtown.

Great addition to market square! Plus they participate in LoyalTree mobile rewards program."}
{"text":"Four of us went here before a Pens game.  The meat and cheese appetizer was the best item we had.  Shrimp and grits too bland.  Chicken and dumplings was too spicey.  Didn't mention that in the menu.  Seafood jambalaya was fishy.  Not very good.......sorry."}
{"text":"I took my fiance to NOLA on the square for her birthday dinner this evening. We're both from the south, and half of my family hails from/resides in New Orleans. We had a 7PM reservation made weeks ago, and were seated immediately upon arrival. We selected the fried alligator and red beans and rice as our starters. The alligator was PHENOMENAL(best I've ever had) and the red beans and rice was spot on! I had the shrimp and grits, while my fiance chose the shrimp and scallops mac daddy. Both were excellent. We settled on the apple/caramel bread pudding for dessert. It was great, as well as the homemade vanilla ice cream that accompanied it. My fiance had the sangria, and enjoyed it. It was a little too rosy for my liking, but it satisfied her palate. Our waiter, Sean, was sufficiently attentive, and the manager, Mark, made his rounds to ensure that each guest had a pleasurable experience. I love the open kitchen setup, which affords you the opportunity to witness the painstaking approach and dedication that is shown to each plate.
We often joke about how Yinzers (generally speaking) don't know good food when they taste it, and often make horrible reviews on good, if not great, restaurants on here. We look forward to coming back to try brunch and po-boys at lunch!
Also worth noting, parking is a premium around the square... That being said, if you make one pass with no spots available, there are a couple of parking garages that are a short walking distance from NOLA."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant, great location, nice interior seating in addition to patio. Pretty real deal New Orleans food with variety but thankfully not overdone or with too high quality ingredients lol. Surprisingly good all around and engaged and attentive service"}
{"text":"I've been to NOLA several times over the years, and I've never had a bad meal. Great beer selection, good mixed drinks, and delicious food.

My wife and I are suckers for good oysters, and they know how to pick me. I'm particularly fond of their gumbo and PO boy sandwiches. You can get a nice side salad for lunch with your meal as well.

Regarding brunch I've had the beignets which are wonderful and the pancake special is always good from my experience. To top it off their coffee is delicious.

For my money, one of the best sit down options in Market Square, or downtown for that matter."}
{"text":"Very friendly busy happening place. Busy on a Tuesday night mainly due to happy hour. 
Great menu phenomenal beers."}
{"text":"I give this place props for even having vegetarian and vegan options. But everything we ordered was far too salty, smothered in oil, and served luke-warm. 

The ambiance was bad. Rickety table and horrible lighting accompanied our dingy back dining room.

Service was actually decent, and our waitstaff was very nice."}
{"text":"Had beers with a friend at the bar. Then we got hungry and ordered two apps: The pork sliders were awesome and the voodoo fries were delicious!   This was my first time here but it will be my last :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my cousin and friend and we had EXCEPTIONAL service. Everyone was really nice and our food was great. I love the atmosphere and the warm ambiance. Their fries are the bomb diggity, no doubt!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of twelve and had a great experience. Service was friendly, food came out rather quickly and everything was delicious. I got the Cajun catfish and loved it, it was cooked well and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly. We also got the jumbalya, steak frites, shrimp and grits, flatbread as well as the Mac cheese. Everyone was sharing and loving their meals, and all but some of the rice for the jumbalya (quite a large portion) was gone!  The appetizers were a little on the small side, but they were also delicious! We got the alligator and some shrimp something. Yum!"}
{"text":"Nola on the square has authentic New Orleans dishes. I love this restaurant, not sure why I don't dine here more often? The menu is reasonably priced and the service is pretty good. I love that they have outdoor seating. The restaurant looks tiny from the outside, but it is surprisingly big inside. I enjoy the jazz style music they play, really makes you feel like you're eating somewhere in the French quarter. I recommend the voodoo pasta. It's really good with the perfect amount of spice, full of vegetables and I suggest adding shrimp. The shrimp are jumbo and grilled to perfection.  I am looking forward to going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good and so were the drinks. This was priced at $$ but it should probably be  $$$. The ribs were way better than I expected. The rib is a beef rib. The firried green tomatoes though....omg they were great! Best ones I have ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered the Seafood Mac Daddy, which is supposed to have lobster, SHRIMP and toasted bread crumb. Sounds great, until I was jipped and only given 2 shrimp with the tail on! On top of that, I had two chunks of black coal in my food (I HAVE PICTURES TO PROVE THIS SAD STATEMENT)... I am still upset about it.
SERVICE: A group of coworkers and I order a few items to go. Upon arriving to the restaurant we were completely ignored by the young lady working the night shift behind the bar, who unfortunately was the only employee in sight. One of my coworkers approached her and asked if we could pay for our meals, she first rolled her eyes, huffed and walked off to complain about us to another patron. Then she held another 10 minute conversation with another guy behind the counter gathering trash, then proceeded to complete our transaction. The name on the receipt is KASSANDDRA S. (December 30, 2014 10:43 pm) 

i ATTEMPTED TO CONACT THEIR MANAGER AND GOT NO RESPONSE..."}
{"text":"The food is good. BUT the waiting time is insanely long!! We waited for an hour for the entree to be served on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I will try to make this short and to the point. 

I was in town for business and decided to give this place a try...

 First and foremost, the food was decent, but nothing special. It's a little overpriced, but it's downtown Pittsburgh so that's to be expected. 

What I didn't expect was the  unprofessional and bizarre service I received. 

The restaurant has a mature business atmosphere, but the two young males I dealt with in particular, were not suited for this environment. 

Normally, when I attend a restaurant of this caliber, the staff knows how to articulate and address their guess with respect. 

These two individuals, the host (who came to my table often) and my waiter, kept talking to me in a manner as if I were one their PlayStation or Xbox buddies. 

For example, these two individuals would say things like: 

\"Man, you want something to drink, dude?\"

\"Umm... You ready to order yet, man?\"

\"Umm... You need anything else, dude?\"

\"Man, you want a bag or something, man? 

It wasn't anything overly egregious, but I kept scratching my head, because it was just weird and unprofessional. 

Here I am, a paying customer, in business attire, in a business atmosphere and I'm being addressed with little to no respect. 

At one point, I thought maybe this was part of the theme of the restaurant, but I doubt it. 

For the record... 

I'm sure a few people will read this and will automatically assume that these two young men were African American or minorities... 

That would be inaccurate. 

These two young men, we're both Caucasian males from Pittsburgh....

Be that as it may, although I received mediocre service at best, I still managed to give my waiter a generous tip based on the required gratuity percentage of my overall bill. 

Again, the food was decent, but I don't expect to spend any more of my hard earned money at this establishment. I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"I used to really like NOLA, but I have had very poor stomach reactions (of food poisoning-degree) to the food twice now.  I know that others have as well.  My staple used to be the oyster stew but I think that this might have been the two-time culprit.  

I think generally the quality of the food has gone down.  Still a decent place for a drink, though.  

I also think that the floors are generally really dirty, and this is a huge turnoff.  

My suggestion, if you're looking for a good place to eat in Market Square, go to Sienna or Il Pizzaiolo.  In the beginning, NOLA was a novel idea (although not even authentically New Orleans cuisine).  The novelty just wore off."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the atmosphere, both staff and patrons made my evening a great time. The food was excellent, drinks affordable, and the band gave me a reason to dance. Fun!"}
{"text":"Generic fried food. Yuck! Jambalaya was pre made and cold in the middle. When asked the waitress to fix it, she said \"of they probably didn't put it in the oven long enough!!\" Do not recommend. Mistake by the owners."}
{"text":"I want to like Nola, probably will and wish them the best.  Trying them for the first time during the arts festival was a mistake. But . . .  The service was horrible. A 7:15 reservation became an 8:00 when we were forced to hover over an outside table waiting for the group to leave. We thought the four-top was incredibly rude as they lingered over their completed and cleared meal until we realized they were still waiting for their check. They immediately produced a credit card only to wait another fifteen minutes for the waitress to return. We then got the same waitress and the same level of service. No manager inquiry and only painfully uneven service. The food--at least the things they weren't out of--was good. But I'll try again on a quieter night."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Monday night while at a week-long conference downtown. The service was very good, and our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. Great music too, and the drinks were very good as well. Unfortunately, the food didn't blow us away. It was above average, just not great. Personally, I would have liked to see the catfish cooked a little more (you can't be too careful when it comes to undercooked seafood), but it was flavorful. Overall, I'd rate the total experience at 3.5 to 3.75 stars if Yelp would let me, and would give NOLA another shot if in the area."}
{"text":"We visited Nola on Saturday night for a late dinner with friends.  Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the service and the food.  My husband had the jambalaya which was appropriately spicy but I thought the tomato sauce was a bit to acidic.  However, the chef did accommodate my husband's request to substitute more scallops for shrimp (he doesn't like shrimp).  My husband also tried the frog legs which he said were OK but not great.  I tried the sauce and the sauce was spicy and very tasty.  I had the filet mignon with swiss chard and squash puree.  The steak was perfectly prepared and the squash puree was creamy and delish!  I didn't eat all the greens because I'm not a big fan of swiss chard - however, the greens were appropriately prepared and not overcooked.  We also tried the butternut squash soup with crawdad tails.  I felt it was under-salted, but otherwise tasty.  Our friends really enjoyed the duck pasta and the mushroom bread pudding.  They had ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, but it didn't appear until our meals had arrived.  Our server was gracious and had it removed from our bill.  The creme brulee is amazing and the panna cotta was outstanding!

One thing that impressed me the most was that the manager came over to check on us several times.  He also had a very thorough knowledge of the whiskey selection and was able to give our friend several very good alternatives to suit her palette.  The beer selection was decent if you're a hop head (which I am).  However, if you aren't into hops, you might find yourself unable to find a suitable beer.

I asked for a table that was near the band but not too close as to preclude any conversation.  I'm happy to say that our table was close enough the music for us to enjoy it and still be able to hear our friends.

Overall, I was incredibly impressed with Nola.  The inconsistent Yelp reviews made me squeamish about visiting, but I'm very glad that I did.  The restaurant is pricey, but the portions are decent and the food is quite good.  This is not the place to go if you have some place to be.  However, if you're in the mood for some music and a leisurely meal, I would recommend Nola.  One thing to remember, don't expect to show up on a weekend and get a table.  Reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good, this place truly deserves to call itself NOLA.  The gumbo was very good (and I have pretty high standards), while my shrimp & grits was good but a bit too \"soupy\" and my colleague seemed very happy with his blackened redfish and red beans & rice.  Bread pudding for desert was also very good, in general the food at NOLA is more expensive than I would expect at home in New Orleans but I know certain items such as shrimp cost a lot more in Pittsburgh so I certainly understand.  Overall NOLA On The Square is the real deal, it's a nice option for those in Pittsburgh to experience real New Orleans food or for people like me to get some home style grub while on the road.."}
{"text":"So, I have been to NOLA a few times and the food is decent but not fantastic, but that isn't really what this review is about. Recently, my girlfriend and I stopped by just for a few drinks. It was a nice night out and we really just wanted to relax at the bar and watch the Pirate game inside. We ordered two drinks and I asked the bartender to not take my girlfriends CC as she wanted to pay, but as a gentleman, I wanted to pay. It was a friendly argument, but the bartender was clearly fixated on my girlfriend, so he took her card instead of mine. That was strike one. As we are drinking, the bartender repeatedly interrupted our conversation not to take additional drink orders, but to flirt with my girlfriend! Being that she is a very nice and a talkative person, she spoke with him for a minute, but he wouldn't leave. Even after I repeatedly interrupted the conversation in an attempt to rescue her, he just simply wouldn't leave us alone after 5 or so minutes of conversation. That was strike two. Finally, another customer came to the bar and he had to wait on them so I thought it was over. We continued our date and everything was going fine. A few minutes later, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, guess who was leaning on the bar trying to chat up my girlfriend again? You got it - same bartender. Strike three! At this point I could sense she was feeling somewhat helpless so I just grabbed her hand and we got out of there. She was so relieved once we left, but it definitely put a damper on the evening. 

So for all you guys out there, take heed - don't take a date to this place unless you want to be repeatedly harassed by bartenders. I for one will never go back."}
{"text":"Great location and friendly people

But the menu and drink list needs work. Was out of a lot of things and to called this creole/Cajun food is just wrong"}
{"text":"Well I am finally back. I have had a busy few months so I have been absent in my reviews and I am looking forward to getting back into it. NOLA seems to me to be a good place to start.

NOLA on Market Square is a great spot to get great Creole, Cajun, and Louisiana inspired cuisine. This type of food is some of my favorite on the planet. Here's an idea: let's take traditional French techniques and dishes, and throw them in a blender with Spanish, African, and American ingredients and methods. That is the basis of Creole cooking and a winning recipe if you ask me. NOLA does it better than anyone I have seen in a long time. I went there with some friends one evening for dinner and drinks. When we got there we were ushered to the back to a table by the kitchen. I was thankful for this for a few reasons. 1) we were out of the front of the restaurant that was being occupied by live music which, while very good Louisiana Jazz, was way too loud for my tastes and 2) we got to see the controlled chaos of a top notch kitchen.

NOLA is decorated with the standard Mardis Gras colors of green, yellow, and purple.The bar is long and has all the bottles lining a backlit mirror. I really dig it. It is warm, intimate, and welcoming (so long as the band isn't rocking too hard).

Service mirrored the the decor. Our server was nice, informative, and followed all the proper steps of perfect service. She seemed to be busy with a full section, yet we were never forced to wait an unreasonable amount of time for our drinks or food. Overall I found the service friendly, competent and all that I could ask for.

As far as the bar is concerned one is in for a treat. NOLA has a decent beer selection with all kinds of Abita products. Hopheads can be content with a Jockomo IPA or a a Purple Haze for the fruit-inclined. Also the cocktail list is rather impressive with all of my selections being delicious, if a little pricey.

For me however, the food is always the main event. For an appetizer I suggest the pork belly (a recurring favorite if you read my reviews). You could also try the alligator bites but they taste just like chicken. Kinda bland. For a main course my go-to is the shrimp and grits. The grits are smooth and creamy with soft fluffy shrimp tossed in all topped with scallions and andouille sausage for heat. Those who possess a spice aversion should try the steak frites. I put it up against Ruth's Chris for quality and taste. 

All in all NOLA is a great place. You will pay good money to go but it is definitely worth it in my book."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Food is OK. Weak happy hour. A bit too dark and a strange /cramped layout around the bar."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and was not disappointed! We got the captain mojitos which has new flavors every few weeks. We had the grapefruit one and it was so good!! We also got some $4 appetizers which were satisfying. We had the cajun andouille and Cajun cheesesticks. The Cajun andouille was pretty good-- not very standout and a little bland but good with the sauce. The cheesesticks were as expected but not much Cajun flavor. Would definitely return here for the drinks but maybe not the food."}
{"text":"Going to the Cultural District to see a show always brings up the opportunity to also explore some of the fun restaurants that cater to the people who work and play in this area. We've not been to Nola on the Square before, so thought we should... and we did.

The building is quite colorful on the outside and the storefront itself is quite narrow. Once inside, the decor is on the dark side with a long corridor between the bar and some table. However, it widens out towards the back (where the kitchen is) and also has an upstairs, so there is actually quite a lot of space there. We were there early, so we saw the staff doing their prep work and watching TV...  Our server did treat us well and came to check on us periodically, so the fact that we were one of only three parties on hand meant that the did not take lesser care of us for watching TV!

The menu is slanted towards either Creole or Southern cooking. In addition to the New Orleans dishes that you might expect to find in a place with this kind of a name, we also saw Fried Green Tomatoes; Chicken and Dumplings; and stuffed Mushrooms that used Pimiento Cheese! 

We ended up ordering the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Mushrooms for our appetizers; then we went with the Voodoo Pasta and the Seafood Jambalaya for our main dishes, and some Beignets for dessert. We also got a bottle of wine and were quite pleased with the price of about $70 per person - which is not high considering the quantities of dishes.

The food quality was somewhat variable, unfortunately. The Fried Green Tomatoes actually needed to be salted, but they came with a yogurt sauce which was fantastic and made the dish! The Mushrooms were disappointing in that was so little of the Pimento Cheese that you could not really taste it. The Voodoo Pasta was supposed to have Bucattini, but I swear that what came on the plate was Spaghetti! the sauce was supposed to be spicy (hence the name) but reminded me more of an Italian Arrabiata sauce than anything else. The Seafood Jambalaya was a study in contrasts: The shrimp and scallops were expertly prepared, but the chicken was charred and overcooked. The sausage was good. The star of the evening were the Beignets that came covered in powdered sugar and also with a small dish of Mango Sorbet (our choice). This dessert made the dinner!

Our waiter was highly knowledgeable about the food and steered us to the appropriate combinations for our taste. We also some saw dishes being take to other tables, and they looked very nice. I would definitely come back here as the cuisine is not the normal Pittsburgh offering and perhaps some of the faults I noted were temporary."}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful and interesting menu options. Well-stocked bar and yummy drinks. Fun and relaxing atmosphere. Friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long?

NOLA had been on my radar for sometime but, I just never made it there. Then they had a severe fire in 2014 and was closed for remodeling so when my team chose NOLA for our annual Holiday Luncheon and being that I had never been I was pretty excited. 

Once we walked in we were teleported straight to Bourbon Street. I have been to New Orleans and this space has the soul and feel of N'awlins.

Not long after we were seated David K. our server greeted us and took our drink orders. There were six in our party so we decided to start off with some appetizers to share. We ordered the Red Beans & Rice, Fried Green Tomatoes (Abita Amber Ale Batter, Cheddar, Creole Mustard Ranch), Salmon Cake (Basil aioli, pickled red onions, cauliflower and Arugula hash) and Stuffed Mirliton (Chayote squash, catfish cake, trinity, dill béchamel). The red beans & rice and fried green tomatoes were the favorites of the group. The red beans & rice had some spice to them and just enough heat. The fried green tomatoes were delicious as well.

For our lunch entrees my team ordered the Seafood Jambalaya (Cajun Rice, Chicken, Shrimp, Sea Scallops, Andouille), Fish Du Jour and the Cajun Grilled Catfish (fire-roasted sweet peppers and onions, mashed Yukon potato, sautéed spinach, spicy lemongrass-citrus Beurre Noisette). I chose the Gumbo Ya-Ya. It featured chicken, Andouille, okra, Filé, and steamed rice and I also chose the Shrimp and Grits. It featured shrimp, Trinity, Abita Amber Ale, Anson Mills cheddar grits and smoked bacon) My God! They were both so good!

Everyone raved about their food and said we had to come back! Very rarely does everyone all like their food as we have some picky eaters on our team.

After lunch a few of us went over to the bar for cocktails. I had the 504 Old Fashioned. It has Makers Mark, Peach Schnapps, Peach Bitters and a orange slice. It is strong with a hint of peach. It was quite delicious.

NOLA on the Square has great Creole food and excellent service. I highly recommend them!

Insider Tip: Come for lunch instead of dinner as the entree prices are about half that of the dinner prices."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday morning and was pretty disappointed. The beignets were an absolute joke, small and crunchy, NOTHING like what you would find in New Orleans. The shrimp and grits also left much to be desired. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and presentation. They're going for that New Orleans flair. I personally have not been yet, but i could only imagine from the ambiance that NOLA provides.  

I went on a Wednesday and there was a live jazz band playing. Had the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. It came with cream spinach and potatoes.  The spinach left a bit to be desired, but the meal itself was still delicious.  For an appetizer, I had the BBQ shrimp. 6 pieces of the juiciest most succulent shrimp ever. 

The place was a bit pricey, but I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"NOLA was wonderful.  I wish we had gotten there sooner to hear more music as the music ends at 11. 
Service was attentive and friendly. Great salads and Flatbread.  If I lived in PGH I'd visit this place again for sure. The BBQ shrimp was just as good as you get in New Orleans."}
{"text":"the grilled catfish was okay, nothing spectacular. crawfish mac daddy was probably the best thing of the night. fried alligator was mostly crumbs. the happy hour drinks are good. beignets were flat and overcoated with powdered sugar, but the ice cream that came with it was great."}
{"text":"Good service, good food & awesome atmosphere! Great addition to Market Square. The jambalaya was yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a good place if you don't mind noise (aka a meal with some boisterous friends). I wouldn't recommend it for a cozy date-night, as it would be too loud to hear each other.  I have only tried a few dishes at Nola, as I have a shellfish allergy and shellfish factors heavily into the menu.  The catfish is my favorite, though I am not a fan of the sides.  It comes with a \"corn-potato maque-choux\" which (excuse the graphic description) basically looks like corn and potatoes someone already ate.  It is a watery, loose mess on the plate.  Good news is that you can substitute other sides for it.  The beignets sat in my stomach like rocks for the rest of the afternoon after I split this dessert with a friend.  The service is hit or miss. I have had great service and I have had absent service.  They have been very accomodating with larger group (8-12)."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really really REALLY did. After moving from New Orleans we were begging for a place that had food from home. This, however, is nothing like it. Even the atmosphere was oddly wrong? Like they read a book on how one thinks New Orleans restaurants are decorated but not how they actually are. Although, the large painting of the second line is great. We did some research and the artists aren't even from Nola, they commissioned someone local. We were then shocked to discover that NONE OF THE CHEFS HAVE COOKED IN NEW ORLEANS!! And boy, it is evident in the food. Now if you are unfamiliar with creole/cajun style cooking I would guess that you would enjoy this place. If, however, you are used to real dining from New Orleans, this will do nothing but disappoint. Service was slow (hey! they got one thing right! haha), cocktails were subpar, and the food lacked the flavor depth that we are used to. I will say one thing, the boudin was pretty darn good! And while this is just being picky, if you are going to have a restaurant themed such as this, your servers should know how to properly pronounce the food they are serving-there's no 'L' sound in andouille (again, picky but in my opinion, true.) Sadly, we still have not found a place that comes even close to home :("}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! I've only been here a few times for lunch and once for happy hour. Both experiences were great with no complaints. The atmosphere is also quite nice, feels a bit fancy and the space is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. For lunch, I always get the soup and half sandwich duo (with fries, of course) because it's a little bit of variety. I've tried the gumbo and french onion soup, and the shredded beef po boy (which I think they took off the menu) and the muffaletta. All have tasted great, a few steps up from an Au Bon Pain lunch. The voodoo fries are seasoned pretty well, a little spicy, so you might not even need ketchup. Nola gets a crowd for lunch, though, so if you plan on coming here, call and reserve a table ahead of time. In terms of drinks, their drinks are pretty great too. The cocktails are a little pricey, but around $10 is the going rate for most drinks downtown anyway. Overall, I think this place is pretty good and my coming back soon is very likely."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers for my boss' birthday and I have to say that this place was really, well I suppose the word to describe it is \"meh\". We went during our lunch hour and found the restaurant itself was not very busy, which was nice because we were seated quite quickly. Our server and the rest of the staff were very polite and attentive. Opening the menu, it was pretty small in terms of food options, normally I take this as a sign that its a restaurant that likes to specialize and only focuses on the freshest and best dishes, however these guys were clearly an exception to the rule. I myself ordered the shrimp and grits which was probably the most expensive menu item (though not that expensive), and I can't recall what my coworkers got, however I must say that when the food came out I was very, very underwhelmed. There was absolutely no kick to the food that one expects to find when visiting a \"New Orleans\" style restaurant and the portions were sub-par to say the least. I'd also note that the food in of itself was just kind of there, it wasn't bad nor was it good in terms of quality, just bland and I've had better for the price. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this place, at least not as a lunch spot, who knows, maybe their dinner specials/happy hours are what actually keep them in business, but I won't be one chomping at the bit to find out."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp appetizer! Ok flatbread. I would return. Music was too loud and the service was awful. I'd give them another chance!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at NOLA on a whim, and partially because it was raining and we didn't want to venture too far from our hotel. We were seated quickly, and despite being in a not so great table (no reservations on a Friday night) service was efficient. 

I had the Muffalata flat bread, it was really good, but huge - it's an app so meant to be shared, but I wished i had a fridge in the hotel to save it for a late night munchie. Instead it went away. He had the seafood jambalaya, which was fine but not very spicy and quite small for the price. 

Overall, NOLA was okay...I don't know that it'd be on my \"you have to try this place in Pittsburgh\" list, but I wouldn't recommend against it or anything either. Definitely just A-OK."}
{"text":"Lunch today. Very impressed. Fun atmosphere. Great service and food. Shrimp appetizer was outstanding. Gumbo solid and enjoyed the shrimp po boy. Not sure about the dinner menu but lunch prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"I guess this place is still working out the kinks. I took my parents here on a Saturday night for a delicious Cajun fiesta and left wanting more. They were out of three signature cocktails (Sazerac, Creole Julep and Le Bon Temps Roule) and the service was friendly yet glacial. I realize they are relatively new but I don't get how you can be 'out' of cocktails on a Saturday night. I settled on a Hennessy Sidecar which was slightly watered down but still delicious.

As for the food, the appetizers were alright. We started with the fried artichokes and Pissaladiere flatbread. While the artichokes were divine, the flatbread left something to be desired. Despite the rich ingredients it tasted bland and lacking. I was also seeing a LOT of black, charred edges on the flatbreads that hit the other tables. There's a difference between a bit of burn and way too much and this fell well into the latter category. My Dad loved his French Onion soup which was rich and sweet and apparently made with three types of onions.

Things improved vastly with our entrees. We had the filet mignon special, shrimp & grits and grilled catfish. Portions here are HUGE and big enough to share. I have to say I was pretty happy with the quality and seasoning of my catfish. My father's filet was so tender and wonderful that he cut it with a butter knife and my mom's shrimps were the size of my hand and super tasty. I am a huge fan of grits and the chef did a decent job with these. They are super chunky and gritty though so if you're not a grits fan, this is not the place to try them.

For dessert we split the chocolate hazelnut torte which was a rich, creamy sweet rather than sugary sweet but again, something was missing. 

We sat in the back room which was much quieter than the front bar area and offered a view of the kitchen which I'm a huge fan of.  In terms of service, I have to give props to the manager. I called around noon to make a 6pm reservation and although he said they were full, he squeezed us in. I would come back here for a cocktail but will be sure to call first."}
{"text":"ow, I was really blown away at NOLA at Market Square. This place was recommended to me by a work associate complimenting the food. I walked in to a busy bar that seemed lively. Come to find it was a pub crawl that stopped crawling. I ordered the squash and pumpkin soup ($6) with the Shrimp and Grits ($27). 

I Thought is was very pricey but I don't mind if the quality is up to par. The atmosphere is very authentic to NOLA but that's where the similarities stop. The soup arrived in seconds and was bitter and salty, obviously it had been reducing for days, which was upsetting because squash and pumpkin soup is usually sweet, warm and delicious. The bartender offered to get me something else so I tried the french onion soup. It took 10 minutes, the cheese was nicely baked but the soup had little onions, it was very salty, and the bread was a gel. 

At this point I was scared to see the shrimp and grits. And as expected the dish was unrecognizable from my Cajun experience. The grits were served as a cake bar which was not seasoned topped with a watery sauce that had congealed under the lamps. The celery was raw and crunchy. This was garnished with inedible garnish \"to offset the color\". Which is sorely needed as the color was disgusting. 

I spoke to the manager who apologized but was unwilling to try the food and didn't seem interested in my opinion. He told me this was a Pittsburgh take on shrimp and grits. And he assured me others like it and removed everything from the bill. I left hungry and unhappy with the managers attitude. If they cared about quality or service the manager would have addressed the poor food immediately.

I feel sorry for everyone there that has to stomach that blemish on Cajun cuisine. In the future listen to customers and if you're going for Cajun in Pittsburgh keep it authentic!"}
{"text":"I've been to Nola on the Square a total of three times now, and (thankfully) every trip was better than the last.

My first trip there was a bit rocky.  Granted, I was there on a Saturday night with a group of about 10.  Plus the restaurant had only been open for a few weeks at that point, so they were probably still working the kinks out at that point.  The packed restaurant definitely took a toll on our service, which was verrrry slow.  And by the time our party arrived, our waiter informed us that they were completely out of pasta, which resulted in almost half the table having to re-examine the menu for another option, including myself.  I understand that this happens, but it still looked pretty bad to be out of pasta by 8pm on a Saturday night in a relatively new restaurant.  I ended up ordering the special dish of the night, which was steak with some form of potatoes and spinach.  All very good, but nothing to write home about.

My second visit found myself and my parents there late on a Sunday afternoon.  We walked in to find the restaurant relatively empty of both patrons.....and staff.  There were three hostesses working, and after receiving a poorly-disguised eye roll from one after I told her we didn't have reservations, they all informed us that the ENTIRE wait staff was currently in a meeting, so no one was available yet to take our order.  We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for the wait staff meeting to adjourn before we could even order a glass of water.  But I put my annoyance at that situation on the hostessses, not the waiters.  It wasn't the waiters fault they were ALL pulled into a meeting simultaneously, and apparently it wasn't in the hostess' job description to ask paying patrons if they wanted something to drink while we waited.  But ANYWAY.  Once our waitress arrived (she was quite lovely), she promptly brought our drinks and took our order.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and was very good.  I had the smoked pork chop which was massive and cooked and seasoned very well.  So despite the horribly rocky start, our meal ended quite nicely.

So FINALLY, upon my third visit, I had a completely positive Nola experience.  My group was promptly seated and our server was very informative and attentive the entire time.  I ordered the Scallps Mac Daddy which was soooooo yummy.  It's hard to go wrong with any combination of mac and cheese plus seafood, so this dish was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to go back for my fourth visit and get it again!

So, after working some glitches out of its system, Nola finally seems to be working like the well-oiled machine it was always meant to be!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Nola with two friends for dinner and had a wonderful experience!  We really wanted to find somewhere fun that still had  great food and Nola certainly fit the bill.  We had a wonderful waiter who did an excellent job seeing that we had just what we wanted.  We couldn't decide what to order and so we told our waiter we wanted three separate entrees and that we wanted to share.  He suggested that he bring out the appetizer first and then the entrees in succession one after another.  We ordered the Crispy Fried Alligator as an appetizer and it was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  The first entree we received was the Shrimp and Grits and it was really delicious.  Two of the people in my group (myself included) have lived in the southern low country and are shrimp and grits snobs and this definitely lived up to expectations!  The second entree was definitely the favorite of the bunch.  We ordered the catfish and it was absolutely delicious.  Our final entree was the jumbalaya and it was highly recommended by our waiter.  It was heated in the wood stove so there was a charred flavor to the stew that I really enjoyed but two other members of our group found off-putting.  The waiter encouraged us to eat dessert but we were simply too full!  Next time, we will definitely give it a try!  We will definitely visit Nola again!  It was an all around wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and each time I try something new and find something I like whether its a salad, sandwich or calzone. Because its a New Orlean's style restaurant, it goes without saying there will be creole, jumbalaya and catfish.  What most people are worried about before eating here is whether there is food here that does not fit those categories or isn't spicy and the answer is yes.  

First off, the fries are great - perfectly crispy, salty, peppery and maybe some creole in there for a side that no one will deny is fantastic.  The NOLA club is a nice twist on the club sandwich, turkey on ciabatta, with spicy aeoli, some crisp bacon, pickled tomatoes and little bit of avacado: A safe move done in a way that makes it exciting. The steak salad is also a good move for those with tenuous affinities for spice but with little flairs to make it unique.  Each dish here is tastefully created and consistently delivered.

The atmosphere is nice and is intended to make one dream of Mardi Gras but patron's won't forget that Pittsburgh is right outside. The service is friendly but nothing to write home about.  Overall the food is a 5 but with the service and slightly-above-generic atmosphere, the place gets a solid 4 in my books."}
{"text":"Certainly a cool spot in Market Square.  A friend and I popped in here on a busy Saturday evening when the Art Fest was going on and were seated immediately with no reservation.  We both enjoyed the jazzmosphere and vibe of the place.  Servers were all super friendly.  The food was a bit pricey, but it is downtown."}
{"text":"Friday night at 6:30 and it's totally empty! What?? It's happy hour from 4-7. They really do have a great happy hour menu. From food to drinks it's cheap and delicious! Tonight I have the white wine sangria, stuff mushrooms and perogies. I was underwhelmed by the perogies. They were just okay. My sangria was so good! I highly recommend for happy hour."}
{"text":"I had the perfectly cooked, chicory rubbed,medium rare, filet mignon steak with sheered brussel sprouts, and potatoes. I'm in love!! I shall return Chef Emeril to try some more of your dishes. Applause to the start."}
{"text":"This has been one of the restaurants on my list for a while and I finally went with some friends ( I had a pay half certificate). 

The place was lively for a tuesday (which I love).  We had a res but we started in the bar for a couple.  The bartenders were friendly actually they must have messed up a dish in the kitchen because we were offered a whole entree while we were at the bar (we accepted). 

We sat down at our table which was in a booth on the other side of the bar, not quite as lively but it was cozy.  We ordered the crocodile and frog legs.  I wasn't a huge fan of the frog but the 'dile was good (it was fried and tossed in an aioli so that might have helped).  I ordered the catfish with rice and beans.  I wasn't a huge fan of my dish.  I guess its a NoLa thing to put pork in black beans ( i was bummed because I don't eat pork). 

My friend ordered the shrimp and grits which sounded delish.  When she got it is was floating in oil. She said the flavor was good but way too oily. 

Pro: Knowledgeable server, lively bar, market square, crocodile was good. 

Cons: Extra oily food, not very veg friendly. 

Overall: I am glad I tried this place but maybe NoLa style food isn't my thing."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. EXPENSIVE. yes, great service, atmosphere, and food. It all really ties into the creole, new orleans feel, and its something different for pittsburgh. I read all of there reviews, about the alligator, the grits...etc. So my friend and I ordered the famous alligator, and being a culinary student, I was ambitious to try it. AWESOME, please try it. Our next courses were the Roasted Quail, and the Seafood jambalaya. 25$ a pop, now this may be due to the fact that the waitress asked if we were sharing, but it's still expensive. However no matter the price it was amazing, the jambalaya was smokey, and all about the seafood. Now my favorite was the Quail, just so juicy with the right spices, and the red wine reduction sauce, just my mouth is watering as we speak...and I just left. Now there was no dessert menu, not even listed on the website, and I was dying for a sweet finish, and all I wanted was a banana's foster. So the waitress Abigail instructed us that, they make their desserts day of, and they had a banana's foster bread pudding with a salted caramel ice cream. BOMB DIGGGITTTYY! I'm totally making this myself. A transformation  of the original and it was just the right finish. They also have live entertainment, I'd suggest to make a reservation via open table or what not, but I over heard the hostess talking to another guest that they do get packed when there is live entertainment. Now you would think that it would get so loud in there. No I wasn't screaming out the top of my lungs to my friend, it was so casual, so jazzy, and so a perfect night. BTW hot valet boys and complimentary at that; after 5 on the weekends I believe. Expect an awesome atmosphere, great food plus service. Just expect to spend your pretty pennies on it. All thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try NOLA as I love New Orleans cuisine.  The new lunch menu looked fantastic. 

Our table was a group of 6 coworkers. Our server was new and had a huge section of tables, so while he was very nice, it was pretty slow service. One coworker didn't get to eat since he had to get back for a meeting. 

We started with fried green tomatoes & gator appetizers. The server said it would be enough food; it wasn't. Four fried green tomatoes & a small plate of gator came out. While the apps were delicious; the portions were very small. We ordered a second gator appetizer. The flavors were there but the portions weren't. 

I had the soup & half sandwich with voodoo fries combo. I opted for the crawfish bisque and catfish Po boy. The soup was very good. The Po boy was very greasy. While I understand it was fried; it shouldn't be dripping with grease. 

No one raved about their food. I'm not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"We ordered red beans & rice and Gumbo soup. I don't think they gave us gumbo soup because it looked like beef tips with lots of gravy which was so salty. The red beans and rice was not tasteful either. We should've taken a picture of the 2 most disgusting meals that are an insult to the state of LA. Please just stop making food and just shut down.
We have also eaten there at least 2 more times within 2 years and it's just terrible and seem to have gotten worst."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, pretty attentive server, and pretty good food. Everything was slightly above average but nothing too exceptional. 

The flatbread was a little ton heavy for my liking but I really like the fish of the day that we got. Yuuuuuum"}
{"text":"Annoyingly poor service and subpar food for the price point. Seems like a tourist trap on the same level as a Hard Rock Cafe. Avoid."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday night with a party of 6.  Nice atmosphere with live jazz in the bar area.  Service was mediocre at best. I started out with the Gumbo as an appetizer.  It was very good, but the rice was noticeably undercooked.  The table also shared a charcuterie board.  The prosciutto was cut at least 1/8 inch thick (everybody knows that prosciutto should be paper thin).  I had a pork tenderloin for dinner that was perfectly cooked and delicious.  I would give this place another try....I think they can do better."}
{"text":"I've been here twice within 1 week and it has instantly become one of my top 5 favorite restaurants to visit. I'll break down my joy below..

Food: Great! I've been to New Orleans, so I wasn't shocked by some of the offerings since they do seem to try to keep to traditional NOLA foods. The only thing (which they do mention) is that the spiciness is adapated for the Northern palate, so it's not as cajun as you might expect. The best? The red velvet bread pudding changed my world --- seriously, just try it out.

Atmosphere: I love the look, feel, and vibe of this place. It's inviting, jovial, and a lot bigger than you'd expect. I was shocked by how large the inside was. They also play live music in the bar most nights. The only issue was that the one band was incredibly loud and my second visit was near the front of the joint. They allowed the band to continue playing loud and we could barely hear eachother. We even told them about it, and the waiters seemed to agree, but nothing was done. While I appreciated the music, it's still a restaurant and not a club.

Service: Great! Both times it seemed that the waiters enjoyed working there and were nothing but nice. 

Price: They are a little expensive. You can get by with a cheaper tab if you stick to their flat breads (starting at $9) and desserts, but you'll definitely end up paying at minimum $15 (most above 20) a plate when you're considering entrees."}
{"text":"One of the best places when it comes to live jazz! They have live jazz 3 times a week and it's ALWAYS good! Their wine menu is also great, the decor is lovely, and the service as well! I gave it 4 stars only because the food is not that great! It's good but I wouldn't go there specifically for the food!"}
{"text":"Food was good not great but the service was awful. I don't even know our servers name because we hardly saw her. Large party for a bday and two meals came 10 mins after everyone else's. No apology. No manager came by. We had to ask for a lot of stuff. 4 people in our party work in a restaurant and usually hook up the servers but we all agreed it was unacceptable our service. Thank goodness my meal was good. Oh and they brought out the bday cake when half of the party was gone and dishes still on the table. It wasn't completely terrible service but a large party of 15 should have more than 1 server on it. Management really needs to train staff on proper steps of service."}
{"text":"Big time Bummer.  This would have been my fourth time going to NOLA for lunch and the first time that I have eaten at the tables as opposed to the bar-top.  We got in before the lunch-rush hit and were seated quickly and in a friendly manner.  Our waiter was quick to ask about out interests in food, take our drink order and walk is through the menu.  Service was good, so that wasn't the issue, the issue here was the food.

I ordered the Chicken Po Boy Sandwhich with a fruit salad instead of fries.  The whole meal was a disappointing, I only ate it because I was hungry and I didn't even do a good job at finishing my plate.  The chicken on the sandwich was dry, not oops it was grilled too long fry but oh dear me this might get stuck in my throat dry.  From there it was a series of unfortunate events.  The bread wasn't up to par with past sandwiches had and I stand by the thought that the bread to content ratio for the particular menu item is skewed in the favor of the bread.  The sausage was good but there was not enough kick to salvage the palate.  I can't remember if there was tomato or lettuce or any other veggie in it mostly because the biggest bummer overpowered the whole entree--the mustard.  It was there in dollops and it wasn't good in its own merit adding to the dryness of the whole sandwich.  Lastly, I chose the fruit salad in lieu of fries ... it was warm.  Now I understand if it's at room temperate in an air conditioned setting like the dining area ... but it was hot kitchen room temperature and biting into it didn't release cooler juices that might have survived the onslaught of the ambient heat in the back.  So that was a big bummer.

I hate that I didn't like the food because my first three times were very good experiences.  When I do return, I'll have to try a different lunch entree since I don't want to risk another Po-saster."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went down to PPG ice rink to celebrate our anniversary, we wanted to grab something to eat before hand but weren't sure where to go. The sign for Nola stuck out to us so we decided to try it. Excellent food! I'm not much of a spicy food person, that's all him, so whenever the waitress said it was a Cajun restaurant I was unsure if I would like it or not but it was perfect for the both of us! Mildly hot for me and nice and spicy for him. The waitress was helpful, friendly, and attentive. I tried frog legs for the first time and was not by any means disappointed! Really cool atmosphere all together, and reasonably priced especially for the quality of food. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I went to nola last night for happy hour. Cheap apps (under $5), $1 gumbo a d $1 red beans and rice a drink specials. All were very good and different. Most was not as spicy as I would have assumed! Food was quick and good. Tried the alligator bites and they were very unique and tasty ! Worth a try even though they were not on happy hour.

Food was good but services was not up to bar. I was dining with friends and we were ordering a variety of small plates. We were from out if the area so we aaked what the happy hour specials were. He got annoyed and only gave us some of the details and we had to inquiry about more. He got annoyed when we would order something.  He barely checked in and got annoyed if we had any comment. Another bartender talked to us and she was much nicer !

If the food hadn't been as good and we hadn't driven 2 hours to try it, I would have left because of that guy."}
{"text":"I just...wow. It isn't often that I get to enjoy a meal that leaves me content to the point that I don't have the words to describe the level of nirvana I've reached. But my long overdue first visit to Nola managed to do just that.

It admittedly took me way too long to finally eat at Nola's - when they opened I was a broke college student, when I graduated I was a broke graduate, and then for a while I honestly was more in the mood to try the many other new eateries we've seen in the last few years. But finally, they were open and I was craving something different. So a meal at Nola it was.

I came here with my family, and between the four of us we sampled a decent chunk of the menu as we traded a couple appetizers and meals between us. After that I'm pretty convinced you can't go wrong with anything here. I loved absolutely everything I tasted. Our appetizers set the perfect tone for the meal - the Catfish Croquettes simply couldn't contain any more meat or stuffing, while the Fried Green Tomatoes were the freshest and richest I've ever tasted. And my Gumbo Ya-Ya struck me as one of the most unique foods I've eaten, and was full of rice, chicken, and okra - yum! 

Even better, after salivating over the appetizers the main courses continued to impress - we sampled the chicken and dumplings and Pork Tenderloin. The first dish contained dumplings that had to have been made fresh and by hand, they were so good - although they paled in comparison to the flavor of the tenderized chicken that came covered with butter and vegetables. But my favorite dish of the night had to be that Pork Tenderloin - the meat practically melted in my mouth, and every bite of marinated pork gave you an amazing explosion of flavor, especially when you piled your fork high with the vegetables and sauces served with it. 

What I'm about to say is probably the understatement of the month - but Nola = YUM. And for the most part, the service was just as fantastic; while I wouldn't have minded a faster pace at the end of the meal as we waited for our checks and boxes, they did provide us with plenty of water and kept our tables clear of empty plates throughout the meal itself. It's probably fair to attribute the slight slowdown to the fact that Nola is just very popular and always busy. I'll admittedly have to remember to give myself plenty of time to enjoy a meal at Nola in the future, just in case, so that I'm not late to my post-dinner plans - but it'll be extra time well spent as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ducked in here Saturday night for a bite and drinks before the ballet...and the main reason we went is because it was too cold to wander around looking for a place to eat.  We should've braved the cold...drinks were ok, I liked my Cajun Martini which had a little kick of jalepeno, that's why it gets two stars instead of one...the catfish appetizer was tasty but very small portion to share, and I was really looking forward to the Shrimp Po Boy since I haven't had a good one in years (in Pittsburgh)...well, it's mostly bun...and slaw/tomato 'filler' ...the bun was tough and cold, and the 4 shrimp on top were heavily breaded and not too tasty...I ate one off the top and sent it back.  Definitely not a $14 sandwich.  My friend said her burger was just \"ok\"..and she was never asked how she wanted it cooked...it came medium rare.  So with four drinks, a burger and appetizer our bill was $70.  With lackluster service (waiter was not very friendly), and the kitchen's inability to get even a simple 'signature' sandwich right...I'll never return."}
{"text":"Heard great things about NOLA. Decided to go for lunch. The waiter was non existent until he decided to come over and tell us their card machine is broken and we can't leave until it's fixed bc no one can pay yet. I'm sorry, im on a lunch break and can't sit around while you trouble shoot something. Now everyone eating is getting angry he legit vanishes. Had to go up to the bar where they said you can leave us your credit card number (no thanks) so I ran to get cash out. They requested everyone's contact information for the owner. The owner called half of our group to apologize and mail a gift card and never called the rest of us."}
{"text":"The Gumbo YaYa and Red Beans & Rice were excellent. The jazz band was very good (cohesive). I can't wait to come back and try the entrees."}
{"text":"Tried this based on pressure from the group I was with. I am generally wary of restaurants in touristy squares. We shared a whole bunch of apps and mains amongst the group. All of the fried bits as starters were good. One plate had a pork shank that was really good. Mains included quail and the hanger steak. Both were tasty.  Was it an epic culinary experience? No. Was I glad we went there? Yup. The food was good enough and it was fun. The good food, unpretentious atmosphere, good beer list and great service all came together to earn this four stars."}
{"text":"The food here varies in quality by a very large amount. We had 4 dishes in total, the fried alligator and catfish were ok, but the jambalaya and margarita flatbread were god awful. They both had extremely strange tastes, and eating them made me want to throw up. Prices aren't cheap either, and the portions are very small."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch, sat outside with our dog.  The service was excellent, our waitress Olivia was super friendly and cheerful .  The app, Fried Green Tomatoes were the best we ever had, that includes the ones from New Orleans.  Super crunch and fantastic spices with a sauce that's to die for.  My wife had a chopped salad with chicken.  The salad should have been chopped a little more, plain Iceberg lettuce, chicken was so so and the hush puppy croutons was a total miss. I had the Shrimp & Grits.  The flavor and plating was spot on!  The spic had the right amount of heat, the shrimp was grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and I wanted to go somewhere different. I'd heard about this restaurant and Market Square is always lively on the weekend so we chose to go here to start the evening off right.

I walked in Nola and was immediately transported to New Orleans. The music was lively and it felt so cozy inside. We got a table in the back where you can see the open kitchen...pretty cool! The service was great and the drinks...my my my. Wow. Amazing! We split appetizers of fried green tomatoes and a crawfish flat bread that was made with a really yummy olive tapenade. Both apps were very good. I can't wait to go back to try their entrees among other things."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Highly recommend the fried green tomatoes. In fact you can't visit NOLA and not get them. I still crave them on a daily basis. The food is tasty and the portions are filling. The drink prices are normal. Over all a very enjoyable place."}
{"text":"Last chance! NOLA is one of the few places that take reservations on Sunday for an early dinner. They were very responsive and put my party of 10 at a great quiet table. That was where the service ended. It took forever to get our drink order and even longer to take our food order. It was not busy and there appeared to be plenty wait staff. If you have never been to real New Orleans, you probably think that the food is authentic .... not even close and the quality of the preparation was poor.  Even though we commented to one of the waiters that the service was slow, no one even tried to make us feel better about our dining experience. Maybe they don't need the business. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night after work for happy hour and dinner. The place was packed but we had reservations for a party of 10. The service we received was phenomenal even though the restaurant filled. The food was the best Cajun food I have had outside of New Orleans. Our entire group feels that this place is The best new restaurant in Pittsburgh. Bravo to owners and chef . Highly recommend it. If I could give this experience 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing, but the service was wonderful! We went on a Friday evening around 7:30, and I do suggest you make a reservation to be safe. I highly recommend the Duck Mac Daddy, which is duck Mac & cheese. It was very rich and filling but my favorite menu item. We also got the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and they were cooked perfectly, and were topped with a very delicious Cajun cream sauce. I would definitely save room for dessert. Kira was our sever and she was attentive, charismatic, and fun, but she never once was overbearing or got in the way of us enjoying our meal. Overall, I would say a great dinner place or just to get drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"The bartender Shane was a friendly gentlemen. The food and service were phenomenal. Shane's energy kept us here all night. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend shared some gumbo and a sandwich/salad combo. The flavor in this food was very unique to most places I've been and impressed us both. We loved the Cajun salad, each bite had something new that we didn't notice before! Also a very nice atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Came here with a group. It was very lovely in the back room , the decorations were cool. The music was some sort of strange 90s/2000s station where they were playing blink 182, self esteem by the offspring, I just wanna fly, and some other odd tunes to hear at a place that was charging $19.00-$30.00 per dinner entree. 

The other reviews were right. Don't come here unless for lunch, its way overpriced for what you get, and it's not that novel. 

They're often out of the thing you want, for example, my friend wanted to order stouts, they were all out, he then tried to order two other beers, all out. My other friend wanted the sidecar cocktail.  All out. It was disappointing.  

We had a big group, but it took over an hour for our food to come out.  One of the 3 main servers that was helping with our group was nice, the other two were visibly angry that they had to help our group, so it felt like anyone in a group shouldn't eat here unless you want to be resented by the staff.  

The food was subpar. Not awful, just not great. I got the $19 chicken and dumplings, where the crispy sage leaves were the best part, overall, just some charred bird in the tiniest bit of gravy. My partner got the margarita flatbread, which had lemons on every slice. It was interesting, but not great. My friend who got the catfish wish the cornbread soufflé let me have some, I thought it was very good, decent seasoning and flavor, but small portion. 

The gendered bathrooms also didn't seem well tended too. The stalls were out of toilet paper. 

All in all, there are better restaurants in the square that'll treat you well with good food and good service. Go to them."}
{"text":"Really great food.  Fresh and unique.  It was a nice change!  Service was slow, though."}
{"text":"With my office in the PPG complex, I really love this little market square at downtown Pittsburgh. DC has our parks, but I wish we had something like this where we can sit. It feels quite European. Anyway, we wandered around looking for a lunch spot and found this place. The lunch price looked pretty reasonable so we decided to just go with it. 

Both my coworker and I decided to get the half sandwich with fries and a soup. I had a French onion soup and the pulled pork sandwich. Sometimes with these lunch deals the sandwiches are so small, but not in this case. It was a good portioned half sandwich, plus a full side of fries. Oh god their fries are so good, like the Cajun fries at Five Guys since it's covered in spices. My French onion soup I didn't like much though. All the cheese kind of gooped up together in the bowl and it was hard to eat. I hate having to bite down on stringy melty cheese like I'm eating noodles. My coworker had the gumbo and the turkey cuban and he said it was really good, and filling. 

Being a New Orleans food, the food wasn't very spicy. But our waiter told us that they don't do it as spicy as true Cajun food, because I guess most of their customers aren't used to that amount of spice. 

Great lunch spot with their lunch deal. I was definitely way too full after this lunch. I just can't resist them fries."}
{"text":"I stopped by for happy hour 5-7. The crawfish flat bread was tasty and the fried pickles were delicious. Service was nice. I also tried the mango captain white daiquiri. Very nice"}
{"text":"My pulled pork Po Boy was good but arrived completely cold. I had to send it back and wait for them to bring me another. My husband ordered the shrimp Po Boy which came with exactly 4 shrimp. They were large, but it looked scarce. It was an average experience. Too bad, we were so excited about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Found ourselves in search of food at 10pm, and we came across Nola.  Decided to give it a try, and we were so pleasantly surprised!  Menu is filled with unusual southern dishes including catfish, alligator, and frogs legs!  My party opted for lighter fair, being so late, but the portions were much larger than expected!  I had the chopped salad and added chicken to it.  Such delicious flavors!  And it was topped with a HUGE chunk of blue cheese! Plus had hush puppy croutons.  One of my friends had the French onion soup and was full about halfway through it.  The other had a flat bread pizza, she customized it a bit, but the waiter forgot that when he put the order in.  Told us that he goofed and had sent it back, and promptly brought out the corrected order.  The service was wonderful.  Also had really good water and supplied each table with a glass bottle for refills.  I highly recommend visiting this restaurant if you're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food & service! atmosphere is a little loud & more of a bar vibe than restaurant, which we don't mind (and while making reservations the man I spoke with on the phone made sure to point this out & recommend a seating spot for us!) although this may have had a lot to do with the band playing. The wait staff were all very nice & well trained on the menu (my husbands a VERY picky eater) side note: if you are a picky eater too there IS a \"bar menu\" they do not serve you if you sit in dining area. Try the fried alligator, it was absolutely delicious & the sauce served with it was fantastic! Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and ambiance. Very accomodating staff and courteous. They will prepare the food as you ask them and there is a vegetarian/vegan menu.  Had a nice team with my group of 10 that were promply seated!"}
{"text":"This is a charming little restaurant in Market Square. We went on a weekend and had to wait quite a bit to get a table. It's a fun atmosphere with a Southern flare. 

The item that I would recommend was the frog legs. I didn't absolutely love the texture of the meat -but then again I'd never tried frog legs before. But I could rant for days about the sauce it was served in. It was probably the most delicious \"masala-y\" dish I'd tasted in a while and we were literally licking the bowl clean.

The french onion soup, on the other hand, was quite salty and too cheesy and overall not really worth ordering.

If I come back here, it'll be for the frog legs."}
{"text":"This place is located in a centralized location in Downtown Pittsburgh. There are many options to choose from but this is the only Cajun place in the area. I hadn't tried cajun food before so I was super excited to try this place. I came right after lunch rush hour so we got seated right away. The waiter was quick and made recommendations. I ordered the Jambalaya which had shrimp, scallops, chicken, and sausage! It was super yummy with its tomato spicy sauce. I recommend this plate when the weather is NOT hot. The plate was super hot so it was hard to enjoy. Either way I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to this place a while ago when it first opened.  It's a good attempt at New Orleans dishes, but missed the mark a bit. Frequenting New Orleans on a regular basis, I know what good, southern creole food is about. I ended up sitting next to a guy at the bar who was from New Orleans and he agreed. 
Did have the beignet dessert and it was a very good attempt. Nothing beats cafe du monde, but this was a pretty decent dessert."}
{"text":"So, the atmosphere is nice and fun and the drinks were good. The services wasn't great, but I think the server was new or overbooked. My real issue was the oysters. They don't know how to shuck them--they were all shriveled and mangled and there was no water in them. On top of that, they were warm, so I have a bad feeling they were not stored correctly. I'll update in two days if I get sick."}
{"text":"I was expecting New Orlean food .It was none of that .We ordered a plate of chhese and meat .I do better job at home and even presentation was not appealing .
We ordered Jambalaya .It was not spicey and full of Ketchup and very pricey for the amount of food ..It tasted like a prefrozen and reheated food .
We also ordered Cjun fish .It w3as not so bad ,but vegetable dish with it was terrible .
For the price you pay ,it would not be on my list of Pitt restaurants to visit,even if I was not paying .It seems to be busy ,I guess most people do not know NORLEAS food"}
{"text":"Was in PBurgh for a conference this week and stopped by this place for lunch in the Market District. I had the turkey Cuban and some red beans. I will have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very tasty, fresh ingredients with a little kick. So much food. Seriously, go for the half sandwich. It was a ridiculous amount to eat.

Service was great and fast- easily doable in an hour. Price was reasonable. A little jealous we don't have NOLA in Columbus."}
{"text":"Food was not worth the price. Our server is under equipped to deal with the public. He should have one table and that table should be robots and that one table should not be ours. He forgot a drink order and claimed to not have heard my food order. He is untimely to refill drinks and seems absolutely insulted to write an order. If I was the manager, he would be retrained or doing something else. I actually had server envy as I observed several servers enjoying their job.

Food: Caesar salad was made with ice berg:
Pizza lacked flavor outside of the green tomatoes
Shrimp and grits is actually a grit type cake. Disappointed from the shrimp and grits 3 years ago. 
Salad featuring Brussels sprouts was fortunate to have 2 Brussel sprouts in it. 

Music was good. Just the right combo and the right loudness. 

Nola is a no thanks!"}
{"text":"For those who work downtown, NOLA seems to continue to be a well-liked lunch spot...  personally, I never initiate that decision.

While the food is alright, I definitely never feel its worth its cost  [for ~$12 you can get a lunch combo (choose 2-2 of soup, salad, sandwich, fries, etc.)].  In addition, the consistency is definitely not there and every time my food comes out, it looks and tastes like it's sat under a head lamp for at least 10-15 minutes.

The one consistent item I landed on was the Chicken Po-Boy, but alas, on my last journey here they updated their menu and did away with it!

Haven't had a chance to come in the evening for live music, etc., but it seems like it may have some potential for a decent date spot."}
{"text":"Food was 4 star and $$, however due to lack of good hosting and service they get overall 3 stars ! I will be coming back to try their sandwich menu next time! Try jambalaya entree it's really good !"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour on a friday evening which runs from 5 until 7. We wanted to sit outside as it was a nice day and were seated quickly. After that our service was not very good. Our server had 4 tables outside and im not sure how many inside she had but she wasn't very helpful, and didn't check in on us very often. We weren't initially given the happy hour menu but a manager brought one to us when we asked. We ordered 4 food items on their happy hour. The brussel sprouts, and catfish fingers were my favorite. I would definitely go back for the catfish. I did not enjoy the pulled pork sliders or mac n cheese as much. The mac n cheese was tasty, but quite salty and it looked like the sauce had split as it was a bit oily. All the food was nice and hot. All in all, it was a pretty good experience. I would like to go back to try some cocktails and listen to some live music!"}
{"text":"Went to NOLA for a mid week lunch retreat.  Ordered the red beans & rice for a starter and the blackened catfish for my main.  Both were excellent but had to add some extra spice with the bundle of hot sauces.  The fish was topped with a green tomato relish that included fresh jalapeños, onion, and corn!!!"}
{"text":"This place was aight. I hated the music choice due to it being a New Orleans inspired place but whatever. I got the shrimp and grits. The flavor was pretty good. A nice smokey kind of flavor. I don't know if I would say this is a place you need to go to but if you stumble into this place with two drinks in you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Not NEW ORLEANS But....there food was good and service was amazing. The alligator was pretty decent and the sauce that came with it was absolutely amazing. (It was a great appetizer). I ordered the jambalaya which had a very very heavy tomato base and two other people with me thought it was spicy(I love spicy, but didn't feel it was). The size of the portion was perfect but I was not expecting more sauce than rice."}
{"text":"I occasionally meet friends for lunch here during the work week. I have turned into a creature of habit with this place, and usually end up with ordering the lunch salad, sandwich, and fries combo with the Nola salad and the southern chicken cordon bleu sandwich. These items are always dependable, and the fries are delicious and crunchy. I love goat cheese on salads, and there are even a few chips on top for added crunch. The sandwich is a very generous portion, even though it is only half of a sandwich.

The drinks look yummy, although I have only ordered beer on tap. The beer on tap list is decent, although I would enjoy more regional selections since the food is all about bringing New Orleans to Pittsburgh.

I love sitting outside when the weather is nice. It's easy to get a last minute open table reservation for lunch, and that way you accumulate open table points while avoiding waiting for a table. When it's too cold to sit outside, there is ample room in the dining room. There are multiple rooms, and lots of room at the bar as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and definitely the right flavor.
On the strong recommendation of an acquaintance, I went to NOLA for the first time yesterday. I was eating lunch by myself and I asked to be seated away from the bar. I was given a nice little booth/table in view of the open kitchen. Pleasant atmosphere. 

My server (Lynette) was exceptionally courteous and attentive. She was knowledgeable and could sell the heck out of the menu and upcoming special events, but she did it in a very conversational helpful way - If NOLA mgmt is reading this, please know you've got one heck of a server and seller in her!

I started with the crawfish bisque, then a catfish and greens entree.This entree had a long mouthwatering description on the menu that I have forgotten; but I will not forget this meal for quite some time. It was a delightful blend of comfort food and fine cuisine. Execution was flawless."}
{"text":"After another couple of visits here, I have to give this place a downgrade. I was excited when it first opened, and may have been a bit overly enthused after my first visit. The food is good...A-OK is actually very apt...but not of the caliber that you'd find in New Orleans. The waitstaff likes to let you know that the chef spent 5 years in New Orleans, and some of the food coming out of the kitchen here reflects that. There are just too many misses for it to be 5 or even 4 star.

We were in for their Mardi Gras celebration last night, and they were offering a few specials for the occasion, which I took advantage of, as the regular menu is not large, and I've had most everything that I want to try on it already. The duck and oyster gumbo was very good, with tender duck meat as well as delightful cracklins, and whole oysters swimming in a full flavored broth with long grain rice. Thumbs up on the gumbo. I was delighted to see crawfish etouffee as a special, as this really belongs on the regular menu of any Creole restaurant. When you get this meal anywhere in New Orleans (I know, I know...I keep harping on the whole New Orleans thing. But this place is claiming that badge, so I feel justified in making the comparison), it comes as a kind of saucy stew served over long grain white rice. Maybe a sprinkle of parsley. The chef here served it over puff pastry with asparagus and house cured tasso. When I saw that description, my heart sank a little, but I ordered it anyway. I understand that he was trying to dress up the dish a little, as people outside of Louisiana might not think the simplicity of this dish warrants a $24 price tag. If I base my review on just the etouffee alone, it was not very good. Not enough creamy sauce, not enough flavor. The addition of the puff pastry and aspargus pulled it down more. The puff pastry was just in the way, and the asparagus, while perfectly cooked, did not belong with the other elements on the plate. The house made tasso lacked depth of flavor, and seemed like just strips of ham that they had put some dry rub on and aged. This whole dish needs work. We skipped dessert last night as we had 2 on our last visit, and they were both disappointing. The NOLA cocktail, which is bourbon, simple syrup, absinthe and lemon juice, had not enough bourbon flavor and too much lemon. I also need to mention service. We had three servers come to our table and say the EXACT SAME THING. One would greet us, let us know that they and another two servers would be taking care of us, ask us if we'd been here before, and get a drink order. By the third time it was beyond annoying, and my vocal partner let them know. I've said it before...team service needs to be three different people doing different tasks, so the customer isn't burdened with repetition. Again, some things here, like the redfish, flat breads, gumbo and the porkchop, are very good. Others need work."}
{"text":"Great food and cool decor, but terrible service. Servers and bar staff were rude and inattentive, took an incredibly long time to get anything"}
{"text":"Great vibe.  Great service. (Maybe a little too chatty).  Great music.   Food was only good not great.  Appreciated the attention to detail but my Jambalaya was only OK."}
{"text":"Ups and downs.  Went on a Saturday night relatively early.  We were excited to get some fried alligator appetizers.  They were out.  Ok, stuff happens.

We were with a party of 10 (pay attention...that'll come back up) and warned that they would add automatic 20% gratuity (ok, no biggie) and would not split the check -- no problem.  A bit tacky, but ok.  We brought a pen to split it ourselves.

Everybody was happy with their entrees, and the soft-shell crab on cucumber (?) gazpacho was OUTSTANDING.  All's well.

Server brings the check -- we're ready!  Pen comes out!  Paying with 4 cards, we split the bill and give her the 4 cards -- put the balance on the last one to cover the tip.

Not sure what the problem was, but there was a minor meltdown.  She ended up grabbing the bill saying \"Ugh, forget it...I'll just split it\" and then came back and threw each of our bills back down on the table.  No exaggeration.  I've never had a bill envelope slammed on the table in front of me.  

Guess she got her 20%....so who cares, right?

Look, it's not that hard to split a check for a group.  It's basic restaurant etiquette.We would have let you know up front.  But it wasn't \"allowed.\"

We left slightly offended with a bad taste in our mouths.  I'm....not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a tough review. A friend and I went to NOLA for dinner this weekend and we had the pierogies for appetizers and I had the jambalaya while she had the shrimp and grits. The appetizers were great but our entrees were SO spicy! 

Both my friend and I love spicy foods so it's not a matter of us having a low tolerance for heat. Both of us have eaten at numerous restaurants in New Orleans before and the entrees we both had were so spicy that it bordered on uneatable. That said, it had the *right* spices, just too much of it.

My friend had been craving shrimp and grits and she said while she was managing with the heat, she found the portion of grits to be lacking. Most people would expect a bowl of grits with the shrimps in the center but NOLA makes a grit cake in the shape of a rectangle for its presentation. There was some kind of bacon over the top that did look good. My friend said there was way too much of whatever sauce the shrimp came in so when she finished, there was still a significant puddle of it left over that felt wasteful but she thought it did taste good.

My jambalaya was tomato-based and came in a small cast-iron cassoulet-type bowl. A hearty serving and piping hot temperature-wise too. Flavorful shrimp and scallops were on top while embedded in the rice were sausage and chicken. Trust me, this was a good dish but someone went seriously overboard with the seasoning. Even the next day I ate some and it was still spicy to me and it gave my friend heartburn. I wanted to be a fan of this meal but unfortunately I'm not."}
{"text":"Beignet's, jambalaya, shrimp and grits, Nola burger, milk punch ice cream cake: all excellent!!! My only quibble was that the waitress was somewhat inattentive. A few of the accoutrements that we asked for we never got, and had to ask for more drinks a couple of times. They were busy but she spent a lot of time talking to other employees in the bar. As a place to eat we lovex everything we got however."}
{"text":"Great drinks! The Cajun martini is my favorite! The alligator appetizer is delicious was a little overdone but ok since we were mainly there to have drinks and it was late. Other times I've been here the food is really great! Nice atmosphere and live band tonight so we had a good time."}
{"text":"Nola is awesome because of its take on the \"mardi gras, New Orleans\" atmosphere. The food is definitely what you would expect it to be from alligator to jambalaya.. I personally favor the flatbreads but that's just me. The staff overall is pretty friendly. The outdoor seating is nice when the weather is right and the inside is dim lit and cooler vibe."}
{"text":"Nola is pretty legit when it comes to a late night three course meal. I came to Nola on a Monday night around 8:30 and it had a perfect ambiance. I honestly couldn't imagine a cajun/creole restaurant with a better feeling. Nola is as close to New Orleans as you can get in our great city.

As far as it comes to signature cocktails, I sampled two. A Gin Concoction that looked more like a white russian, but was very refreshing at the same time. And since I, myself, felt like such a amateur (girly) drinker, I had to order something with bourbon in it after. So, I went with something that tasted and looked a lot like a Manhattan, but had a much smoother aftertaste. 

For an appetizer,  we delicately chose the crab gratin, which came with six perfectly toasted pieces of french baguette. The gratin was perfect with melted cheese on top, and it wasn't filling, like some other gratin based meal that makes one feel full after a few indulgences. You could see the gigantic lump crab meat on every bite.

The entree was a bit expensive for a filet mignon at $33 for a plate of glorified steak, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. But damn, it was amazing. The steak was the best cooked medium-rare filet mignon I've ever had.  The mashed potatoes were just like something your grandma would make. 

For desert, my date and I went with a chocolate mousse, with a chocolate cake middle layer, and on top was a roasted marshmallow, which was the size of a softball. After taking two bites, my mind and stomach threw in the towel. 

The whole entire meal was perfect from start to finish. The only reason I'm giving Nola four stars and not five is because of the price. I definitely felt like Nola charges way too much for the type of establishment they portray themselves to be when you walk in and sit down. Just a thought."}
{"text":"THE CRAWFISH MAC AND CHEESE. Their happy hour has great specials and the food is a great take on Nola cuisine."}
{"text":"Excellent gumbo. Jumbalaya was ok.

Good selection of beer.

They had live music and so it was really loud. Had no shout to talk. The bad was good but just not time to chat."}
{"text":"Excellent. Authentic New Orleans food as good as I've had outside of New Orleans. The place looks, feels and tastes like New Orleans. Definitely worth a visit when in Pittsburgh. Also a great location right on Market Square.

Beignets almost as good as Cafe Du Monde. Po'Boys were on perfectly baked French Bread. The oysters and shrimp were perfectly seasoned and fried.

Outdoor seating seating available. 

A taste of New Orleans in Pittsburgh of all places."}
{"text":"Talk about world problems. It's tough to write a negative review for a restaurant experience during which you actually enjoyed your meal. HOWEVER, after three times trying NOLA it's time for an official 2-star review.  In my past experience here, the service has been very slow.  Fine, really - as long as you have the time to spare.  Yesterday's visit was no exception.  

Our party of 6 arrived to a mostly-empty restaurant between 12:30 and 12:45 for NOLA's brunch.  Three members of our group ordered the special of the day: Banana Bread French Toast.  Sounds amazing, right?!  Well, it was, but I'll get to that.  The food took a while to get to our table and when it did, it was mostly...wrong.  The three who had ordered the special were served the regular French toast instead; which was a big departure from the advertised special.  The server was very apologetic and explained that due to a glitch in the system, the regular French toast was ordered instead of the special, but that the situation would be remedied.  And each of them did finally receive the amazing banana bread French toast eventually; but not after eating pretty much all of the original French toast since the replacement order was slow to arrive.

In the meantime, another friend leaned in and, very innocently asked, \"Is Eggs Benedict supposed to be cold?\"  Alas friend, it is not supposed to be cold.  She sheepishly mentioned this to our server, who really was quite upset at the entire spectacle on our behalf, and he took it to the kitchen immediately.  What returned a few minutes later was Eggs Benedict.  Her previous order of Eggs Benedict, to be exact.  The same bit was taken out of the one muffin and the previously beautifully poached eggs, were now a yellow mess of luke-warm goo on top of each muffin.  

The good news is, the company was stellar and we mostly laughed through the entire visit.  We also felt bad for our server and knew full-well that most of this was likely not his fault.  He mentioned that he would be speaking to the manager since the situation was \"unacceptable.\"  The manager did stop by our table to ask how everything was going.  We mentioned that there were a few \"glitches\" and left it at that.  He asked if the only issues of the day were with the French toast.  We explained that another dish arrived cold and appeared to have just been reheated in the microwave, to wish he replied \"we don't own a microwave.\" Meooow.  No one pursued the issue and all of us were given 50% off our respective bills - even those two of us (myself included) who were served their food without issue (Shrimp Clemenceu and another who ordered Fried Chicken & Waffles).

Soooo, NOLA. What do to? The food is pretty good. The service is pretty slow. And, up until the aforementioned manager paid us an odd visit, I might've given it another go.  But that was just...well...weird."}
{"text":"Wow was really looking forward to trying this place out while we were in the Burgh and I am sorry to say I was not impressed. The decor and service were great but the food was OK at best. The alligator was all breading, the fried green tomatoes were lame and my blackened fish was so dry it turned to dust when I touched it. Another person at our table got the same fish and it was cooked the same way which was too much. The scallops and noodles with cheese was by far the best dish at the table but even that lacked scallops. The alcohol selection was good and the cocktail I had with milk and bourbon (can't remember the name) was very tasty. Unfortunately the next time I am in pittsburgh I will be dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"Christa is the man! She was my bartender for the evening, she also works at Perle right next door.  http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=V7uS5US4oTf-S9u36HJQCQ&q=perle

Any who I had the frog legs and also gumbo.  I love me some gumbo and I like that Nolas is keeping with Creole tradition and has okra in their gumbo. The flavors of the gumbo were on point , smokey, and spicy with sausage, veggies and as I mentioned okra and rice.

On to the frog legs. I would have preferred my frog legs battered and deep fried...but none the less they were still really tasty. 

Nola's is open on Sundays too, which is a bonus for me since I work Downtown on Sundays, and it's just a short 10 minute walk from Grant street. I now have a swanky place to enjoy a cocktail or two after work.

The entire front of the restaurant opens up to the square which is lovely in warm weather and brings in a lot of sunshine and it's great to see the owners working the floor and checking on you that for me is some quality service."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant located in Market Square. Valet parking and wait staff in ties makes the place look a bit more upscale then it really is.

Only split a shrimp appetizer here but it was good. The beer list was awesome and you can even order New Orleans style drinks like the Hurricane.

Get there and snag a table outdoors  for people watching, this place is frequented by ridiculous drunk middle aged women. I saw a woman take her shoes off grab onto a parking attendant and start running across Market Square."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin.  I have been to Nola's three times and have had three different types of experiences.  The first time was for lunch in 2012.  From what I can recall it was decent.  The next time I went to Nola was for brunch over my birthday weekend.  The Big Y Group, in case you didn't know, offers birthday dinners/lunch or brunches around your birthday if you sign up online.  You should sign up it's a good deal and you can use it at most of their locations.  So on to Brunch.

We made reservations.  Not needed, I believe we were the only people in there at 11:30 on a sunny Sunday in August.  We had a waitress who was training another girl.  We ordered some beer and OJ to make beermimosas , try it if you haven't.  It's not just for hipsters kids.  I ordered the Eggs Trivette, Toasted Challah Bread, Crawfish Tail Meat, Black Pepper Bacon, Crystal Béchamel, Over-Easy Eggs, Served with Fruit Salad.  The wait was a little on the long side being that we were dining completely alone, but not over-the-top long.  Our food came out and I did enjoy the eggs, but didn't taste much crawfish.  The sauce was rich but nothing said Cajun to me like I would have expected.  Still a tasty dish, but the fruit salad it came with was pathetic.  There was a mix of pineapple which was mostly core, =inedible, some dried up pieces of cantaloupe and honeydew and a few slivers of watermelon.  Who put this together?  It was clearly old and really disappointing for a restaurant that is supposed to be more upscale.  However, overall it wasn't bad, and had I written my review 3 months ago they would have received 3 stars, but I didn't.  This leads me to our last visit, which occurred over Halloween weekend approximately 5:30 in the evening.  


We headed to Nola's this time for drinks.  I was really in the mood to have some rye whisky or bourbon as I enjoy the finer things in life.  We secured a spot at the bar and was perusing the drink menu.  My husband really likes German style beers, and I noticed they had St. Pauli Girl on the bottle menu.  Mind you this is listed under their beer list and priced at $4.50, I encouraged him to order it even though he never had it since I've been known to dabble in the sampling of fine wines and beers and found it enjoyable in the past.  I went with a SAZERAC $10 BULLEIT RYE OR HENNESSY | HERBSAINT | PEYCHAUD'S BITTERS | ESSENTIAL LEMON OIL. 

 Side note.  This is Halloween weekend and everyone working there is in costume.  For the love of God I don't know why places encourage or make their employees dress for Halloween but I am off topic. 

 Anyhow, there were a couple of bartenders and waiters and waitresses kind of loitering at the bar, I am assuming since it was early and there weren't many people in the place yet.  I get the male bartenders attention and we order the pre-mentioned drinks.  He makes mine first then sets a non-alcoholic beer in front of my husband and walks away. Said husband notices a few moments after that this is not what was expected.  I was kind of upset, because I feel that drink had NO business being listed on the \"BEER\" menu if it is not alcoholic and doesn't come out and clearly say that.  Listed next to its name it says n/a.  Well I don't know what n/a meant maybe the restaurant should spell out Non-alcoholic, or put it in the section next to where you order soft drinks.  I was pretty upset, feeling that the bartender should have said something to warn us and just really wanted to get him another beer.  Well now the bartender is at the end of the bar talking to Donald Trump (waiter) laughing it up and I am yelling over excuse me.  Well bartender makes a half assed attempt at coming down to talk to me.  He starts to walk toward me as Donald must have said something that beckoned him back as I was only in mid-sentence of explaining that we weren't aware the drink was not alcoholic he dips back and turns to Trump laughing at whatever line came out of his mouth.  I said quite loud oh that's nice walk away while I am talking to you?  He just kind of looks at me and Matt says never mind I'll just drink it it's not that bad.  It was that bad and I am not only upset that the bartender didn't alert us of the non-alcoholic (in my world N/A means not applicable, but in this case is very applicable) drink, but that he found it more important to laugh with the other employees than speak to a customer talking to him.  To top it off I heard him insult a female employee about what she was wearing to a very negative tune when another female employee told her to ignore him.  It was very disrespectful.  I fumed the rest of the short visit and asked for the check from the female bartender.  I didn't want to tip anything but knew they probably all split tips so I did so sparingly.  Epic fail, can't think of a reason to return.  I will use my birthday coupon at another Big Y Group restaurant next year."}
{"text":"I had the blackened catfish, which was fine.  Not great, but fine. My mom got the jambalaya which was hands down the worst I've ever tasted, by a good margin. It was basically mushy, fishy shrimp and scallops and rice in tomato paste. Awful. The wait staff was great I'll say, but the food really lacking."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for dinner and the one bartender/server gave me the impression that he couldn't be bothered. We had to seek him out for refills and he seemed bothered by us wanting to order food. Definitely wasn't a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"WOW. I was seriously so impressed with NOLA. My friend and I decided to go here for dinner on a Thursday night on a whim. I'd heard pretty good things about the place so I was excited to give it a try. We were seated quickly (the place is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside) and our server came right over. They were fairly busy but not packed. I was feeling somewhat confused by the menu because I am NOT familiar with Creole food at all, so I was very happy when our server asked if we've been there before and helped us a lot with the menu when we told her we hadn't.

She was extremely familiar with the menu, and even things that weren't actually on the menu but could be done by customizing a dish. She recommended the jambalaya and the scallops mac daddy, which is a scallop mac and cheese dish. My friend got the jambalaya and I got the scallops, and we opted for a flatbread pizza as an appetizer. We were so happy with our choices. Everything was absolutely excellent. And I can't stress enough how great the service was.

The manager came over and asked how our meals were and about our experience in general, which was nice of her and we told her how pleased we were.

As a disclaimer, yes it is a little pricey but in my opinion the food and the service is well worth it. And it's in a great location in Market Square. We will certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"Today's visit for lunch was just ok.  Not as good as previous visits for lunch and dinner. I attended a lunch outing with my team.   Our server Kelli, was great, she was patient and attentive.  I ordered the mushroom panini and voodoo fries.  I also ordered the gumbo appetizer as a starter.   The gumbo arrived a short time later, and it was ok, but the base tasted just a little bit burnt.  It was good, but had a bitter aftertaste.  The panini sandwich was a bit of a disappointment.  The multi-grain bread would have been better had it been toasted correctly.  The bread had been buttered and not left on the grill long enough to toast properly, which left the bread greasy and soggy.   Also the portabello mushroom was much smaller than the bread slices, so there was LOTS of bread and very little mushroom.   I'll definitely return to NOLA, but would definitely order a different item."}
{"text":"It's fun and the food is good. But don't expect authentic New Orleans cuisine.  It's a festive atmosphere, and there's live music on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.  Our service was fairly good. 

The dining room is quite expansive, and there's also a long narrow room that has the bar.

We were excited by the happy hour specials listed on the sign out front, but disappointed those were only available at the bar.  Why make rules like this?

Overall, the food is good, but rather pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I love Nola...great service and great food! Consistent after 6 years and the new happy hour was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Fairly descent Cajun/Creole food, but quite pricey.  Considered more 'upscale', which I find funny.  Good drinks, great location and has charm.  They have live entertainment and their brunch is worth checking out. Drink specials and they are strong :-)"}
{"text":"Visiting the Pittsburgh area found this place on yelp. The food was good. Fries was cold and my Gumbo was cold too. SERVICES WAS VERY BAD and it was not busy  it was on a Thursday at 3:00."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Nola. We ordered some reasonably priced wine and a meat and cheese plate when we first sat down. I would absolutely recommend the meat and cheese plate. It was simple but delicious and huge for the price. I had the jambalaya which was also very good. Our server was very courteous and made some good recommendations. My only complaint is that they were out of quite a few things- such as scallops and the fish of the day- and the kitchen seemed to be annoyed at our substitutions for the out of stock seafood. We heard one chef or cook admonish our waitress for allowing us to substitute catfish for scallops in jambalaya. If you are out of multiple menu items, it is only reasonable to allow some leeway with otherwise inappropriate substitutions. We did get our catfish but the chef could have been a little more accommodating to the server's request. Overall though, it was a really great meal."}
{"text":"Good Cajun food in the heart of Pittsburgh Market Square. It's cool how they've tried to recreate a NOLA French quarter-like look for the exterior, and a NOLA Bourboun street-like electrifying atmosphere inside. I hadn't imagined the place would be so huge before entering, but thankfully that meant there wasn't any wait for lunch on a busy Christmas weekend.  Loved the ambience and the decor inside, cool yet classy. Our waiter let us know that they were out of a couple of the menu items due to the Christmas craziness. No issues, the menu still had a number of tempting options. I stuck to classic Jambalaya, while my husband opted for the NOLA burger. Both of them were spot on. I loved the complex flavors of the jambalaya and the generous portions of meat and shrimp. 
So what's not to like about this place? The service. Well, I'm not sure if it was a one-off experience for us, since other Yelpers seem to be happy with the service. I understand that it was Christmas weekend, but the painfully slow service when the restaurant was half-empty is not quite acceptable. The waiter came to take our order minutes after we arrived, and when we said we needed some time to look through the menu, he went on a mini-vacation. Once he finally took our order, he went on a world-tour..our food took forever to arrive. No explanations for the delay, not even an update, our waiter seemed to really hate our table. I had to ask others for water, ketchup, etc. I could see the staff all around us very lively and sociable, and if I could interact with any of them, this could have easily turned into a much better dining experience."}
{"text":"What a cool place. The live music brought my friend and I in on a Friday night. We sat at the bar and our bartender immediately greeted us and was very inviting and friendly. 

My friend had a couple glasses of wine and I was in the mood for beer, so I tried hop gator by Abita Ales. Being the beer nerd that I am, I noticed that a lot of their featured \"seasonals\" were not very seasonal at all- at least three of them had release dates in early spring . BUT hop gator was quite good. Smooth and it was served in a fancy little beer glass. 

We weren't planning on eating but one of the bartenders gave us a menu and I couldn't help but look. I saw fried green tomatoes and had to order them. I also ordered the New Orleans style BBQ shrimp because I was curious how their seafood was- being a New Orleans themed restaurant and all. 

Yum. The shrimp was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! The sauce was amazing! The fried green tomatoes were good as well but not the best that I had. Wouldn't order them again. The shrimp alone is why I will come back and try some more New Orleans goodies!"}
{"text":"Typical go to after your dreaded day at the office. Every spineless group of sheeple flock here during happy hour. Your drinks will be poured by your stereotypical xenophobic hungover bag of bones behind the bar. There's a great opportunity for a decent pub in this location, but for some reason, they chose to fill it with a bunch of robots hungover from yesterday's bullshit. Thanks but no thanks Nola. Keep slinging Bud Light drafts to Pittsburgh's finest  
2 stars for the amazing kitchen work. If you can sit through the inhospitable staff, order from the food menu.... if it's provided..... CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Pretty good southern food fare! Reservations are a must, otherwise there may be a long wait, although last time we waited around 20 minutes when they had told us it'd be 45-60 minutes. There was a $5 off for joining loyaltree's iphone app and scanning the QR code inside the bill folder. So yay for unexpected and extra discounts."}
{"text":"The food was a C for us but I am a New Orleans regular. So I can't be easily moved with creole/Cajun cuisine. BUT the drink was great and the staff was AWESOME. so the experience was balanced."}
{"text":"We went to NOLA on a Friday night when we had tickets to a show in the cultural district. I had the crispy alligator bites to start, and the jambalaya for my meal. The aioli on the alligator was excellent - I was eating the crunchy fried bits that came off of the meat just to scoop up the sauce. The jambalaya had an excellent taste. As someone who has been to New Orleans, I can safely say that it tasted _nothing_ like actual New Orleans jambalaya, so if you are looking for authentic creole, you will be disappointed.  The jambalaya was very tomatoey, and not nearly as spicey as I expected. And, there were just 2 pieces each of shrimp and scallop on the top, and none mixed in with the rice. However, although I would not characterize it as authentic, it was still delicious. The blackened chicken and spicy sausage that was mixed in with the rice was really good. I would eat here again, and if I did, I would probably get the jambalaya again (again, the food tasted very good, as long as you don't expect authentic). On a side note, I mentioned to the server that we couldn't linger too long, because we had theatre tickets, and he told us that if we could show him the tickets, we could get a 15% discount. So that was a nice bonus, and if you come before a show, be sure to bring your tickets with you."}
{"text":"I had dinner at NOLA on a Saturday evening before a Pens game with my son. Our 5:15pm arrival allowed for no waiting and a relaxing meal with plenty of time, (almost an hour) to walk to Console Energy Center afterward.

   We received quick and friendly service. The waitress was very helpful with her suggestions. We enjoyed a Shrimp Po Boy and the NOLA Burger both served with fries in Voodoo Dust which were a big hit!! 
  
 The French Onion Soup is VERY good and also a great value as it is topped with gruyere cheese. A definite must try and worth the trip itself!

  We were both pleased that NOLA was our choice for our pre game meal and I will soon return!"}
{"text":"Went here on St Pattys day. Empty restaurant, but had a good French onion soup and Cajun catfish that was only ok.  Only Pittsburgh knows how to make the BEST French onion soup! Don't know why....they just do!"}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh a year ago, and have been a solid fan of NOLA until last night.  

I had out-of-town guests and wanted to show the city off to them, thinking that a dinner at NOLA would be a great introduction.

Well, I failed to reckon that it was Friday, and, further, did not know that the live music was starting during prime dining hours.

What an embarrassment.

We were somewhat removed from where the singer was but, still, it was so loud that we were not able to attempt conversation.  We had much to talk about, but NOLA clearly was not the place.  I know that there are fans of ear-splitting music, but it completely ruined our evening.  After exiting the restaurant, it took us a while to stop shouting at each other to be heard. 

And NOLA, as you may know, is not cheap.  At the risk of setting off the ¨If it´s too loud, you are too old\" crowd, I wonder if NOLA would consider postponing the music until after the time when people are normally eating their meals.  Or toning it down a bit.  

As usual, the food was delicious, the service was great (I have forgiven the restaurant for the time I asked for a pepper vodka martini that came with a layer of ground black pepper on the bottom of the glass) but any enjoyment was destroyed by the painfully loud music.

I would like to come back, NOLA, but..."}
{"text":"I've only been in once for lunch but if the rest of the menu is comprable to the blackened shrimp I had, then I can certainly stand by NOLA. Best blackened shrimp of my life. Excellent little salad. Portion wise it was just right for lunch (maybe a bit on the small size but that's how I like to eat). Waiter was attentive and quick with suggestions. Overall a very successful meal. Would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time, it gets better and better. 

The ambiance is fun New Orleans.  Not trashy Bourbon street, but like if Bourbon street had a classier, older brother.  

The kitchen is open which I love, so you can see them making the food and see what other people are getting - the next time, I'll be having what she's having. 

The food is awesome.  I went here for lunch, so sadly no beer for me, but S had a Guiness and an Abita - a New Orleans beer which is awesome.  I prefer the Purple haze or Turbodog, but he had the seasonal that he liked. I got the spinach and strawberry salad with an add on of catfish.  It also had blue cheese - and whoa did it ever!  Tons of the pungent blue stuff - and cajun pepitas.  

Delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth it for happy hour (M-F 5-7PM), they have drink as well as food specials. However, the two dishes that I ordered (Cajun cheese sticks and fried Cajun andouille balls) were kind of bland and nothing special, but for $4 each, I can't really complain. 

The captain mojito (also $4), however, was amazing and not too strong! They have different flavors depending on the day and although mine was supposed to be grapefruit, I did not think it tasted like it. Still delicious regardless!    

The staff was attentive and food came out petty quick as well."}
{"text":"Being a native of Louisiana, I find the hospitality and decor a great remider of home. The atmosphere, food, and overall customer service makes this a perfect place to unwind after a long day, or meet with friends. 

For starters  you must order the Voodoo Doll drink (very smooth),  and Red Beans (SEASONED JUST RIGHT). 

Don't judge me becuase I also had the catfish entree and it was great, especially paired with the mashed potatoes. Now in Louisiana we take pride in our food and especially desserts and the beignets are as good as the orginial Cafe Du Monde.  

I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in Nola for Sunday brunch! Great drinks, service and cozy atmosphere. The Mimosa was bubbly the beignets were sugary and sweet! I had the Eggs Benedict a cajun peppery smoked pork topped with eggs poached to perfection!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance for dinner.  We had made reservations on open table and arrived a few minutes before our time.  The bar and outside seating was absolutely packed and I thought that this was going to be a problem but we were taken into the dining room which was fairly empty at this point (5:30) and thankfully quiet.  The decor of NOLA is pretty cool as it incorporates many pictures and items that make you think of New Orleans like a picture of Cafe Du Monde, Mardi Gras related art and a picture of a jazz band walking down the street,

My fiance and I decided to start off our evening with the fried green tomatoes.  Whenever they came out I was surprised at the size of the tomatoes as they were not even close to be being thinly sliced like I had imagined.  They were breaded in abita batter and sat on top of a base of creole ranch mustard while being smothered on top with cheddar cheese.  The fried green tomatoes ended up tasting good and I thought the thickness of the tomatoes actually gave a good tomato/batter ratio and brought in enough acidity from the tomato that it paired nicely with the savory cheese.  For my entree I decided to go with the Bourbon Street Pasta.  It was a gemelli pasta that had 8 or so fried oysters around the outside and then tasso ham, peas and piave cheese mixed with the pasta and was topped by a single cooked egg yolk.  Breaking the egg yolk into the pasta gave the pasta a little extra creaminess which I enjoyed.  Overall it was a good dish with the salty fried oysters being my favorite part of it.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely had back to NOLA again in the future.  I am actually surprised that I hadn't written a review of this before as I have been to NOLA many times and have always been satisfied with the service and food that I received."}
{"text":"Food was delicious (based off of the soup they remembered to give me and my parents food. My family and i came in for lunch here. It wasnt busy at all and it took over an hour to get our food. The waiter was fantastic. The cooks in the back, not so much. Although the food tasted great, they were so slow, the waiters were standing around with nothing to do. They forgot the salad I orderd and it took them so long to get me another one (IT WAS A GARDEN SALAD)  I had to request it to go. They also forgot to add the dressing, which the waiter realized and was kind enough to go fill up a container of it for me himself. I would come back again, but only if I have nothing to do for the next two-three hours. My parents had a Pirates Game to get to."}
{"text":"I grew up in Louisiana so I was excited to come across a New Orleans themed restaurant. The server even said the restaurant was approved by the City of New Orleans, so I was quite anxious to try out the different dishes that I've been missing. First of all, I have to say that the ambiance is very inviting. When my boyfriend and I went, they had a live jazz band performing.

While the service was excellent, the food itself was subpar. First, we had the fried alligator. It was ok, but I think they should consider serving blackened alligator instead, because alligator can be quite fatty and frying it makes it even oiler. The frog legs were actually great. Super flavorful sauce. My only complaint with that dish is that I wish they gave us some bread to mop up more of the sauce because there wasn't much meat to the frog legs (of course) and there was a lot of yummy sauce left. We got two seafood jambalayas. Strangely, one of the dishes was lukewarm, while the other one was piping hot. The jambalaya tasted ok, but didn't resemble the jambalaya I grew up with. I think the rice was a bit too mushy and there wasn't any spice to it. We also ordered the crawfish tapenade flatbread. This dish was the worst as the flatbread was soft and mushy, and the crawfish and olives didn't go well together. We had to use utensils for this dish because it fell apart in our hands (as flatbread should not). For dessert, I had to try the beignets. The were the worst beignets I've ever had. I think what went wrong is that they fried the dough and then completely caked the beignets in the powdered sugar. If you let that sit around, then the powdered sugar gets mushy and crusted on, instead of lightly sitting on top of the fried dough. If I could recommend a change, I'd say they should try dusting the powdered sugar on, instead of tossing the fried dough in a bowl of powdered sugar. I have to say though that the housemade sorbets that were oddly paired with the beignets were excellent. Last suggestion to the restaurant is that they should hire a chef from New Orleans. I think that would help a lot. 

Sorry this post is a bit of a rant about what they should change. I don't want to be too down on the place, but I came in with high expectations, and ended up paying a good amount of money for food that doesn't do New Orleans justice. Next time, I'll just save the money towards a plane ticket to NOLA."}
{"text":"Pretty average place. Alligator appetizer was overly greasy, hard to tell what kind of meat was in there. The mains were over-sauced but filling and relatively tasty. A better beer selection would improve things as well."}
{"text":"Last night in Pittsburgh on a Sunday and we were walking the 'Square' to find dinner. Checked out the menu and got our appetites ready. The Mrs. and I couldn't decide so we shared 2 different entrees (one being the grilled chicken and dumplings and I ordered the pork tenderloin). We ordered fries and mac and cheese for our little one. He enjoyed the fries. They're definitely much better than Primanti's! The mac and cheese was a nice take on the traditional kid friendly item with corkscrew pasta in a creamy cheese sauce. 
Onto the good stuff, my pork tenderloin was heavenly for lack of a better description. Ok, it was tender and flavorful in a sweet potato purée. It was delicious to the last bite. My wife had ordered the grilled chicken and dumplings. That was light and delicious and was complemented with grilled carrots and peas. The flavor and seasoning of the chicken was spot on. I had asked for hot sauce. Both entrees didn't need any additional seasoning or condiments! 
For dessert we had the beignets with ice cream. It was made to order and a good complement to a great dinner.
Service was friendly and on target. The food was brought out quickly. All of the waitstaff was friendly, attentive and on their game even though they were closing within the hour. We never felt rushed, and everything was timely.  People watching on the square is a whole other thing to do while you dine."}
{"text":"Based solely off of customer service- I live in Orlando, but my dad was having his birthday dinner at Nola's about a month ago. I called and spoke with a friendly girl and asked if I could send a drink to the birthday boys table and she was more than happy to assist me promptly. It was a busy night for them plus and unusual request so, I was pleased that she was so willing to help!"}
{"text":"I've been to NOLA twice, once for lunch and once for drinks and an appetizer. 

I really enjoyed both experiences. My lunch with delicious, I had the Chicken & Andouille Po Boy with a side of fries and salad. I really enjoyed the flavors in all of the dishes! The fries were probably my favorite. 

I couldn't help put love the decorations and layout of the restaurant as well. 

The second time I went my friends and I split a bunch of apps. I was most impressed with the amazing french onion soup (hello, Gruyere!) and Abita Battered Shrimp Basket. 

Can't wait to go back and dine again!"}
{"text":"Eager if not expert service (lots of \"who gets what dish\" when the food came). Mediocre but decent French onion soup (served only wam, rather than hot). Catfish was nicely cooked, but swimming in butter. I didn't so much mind that, being a big fan of butter....however that is, of course, a lazy way to make something taste good."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Sat for over a half hour before we got our drinks, after we waved down 2 different people asking to place an order. I typically tip 20% or more.....i will begrudgingly tip under 15 which i have not done in 15 years...service was that bad. Food was good, borderline great. Unfortunately the sevice was do shitty that it ruined the meal."}
{"text":"I checked out this restaurant on a Saturday night, and it had a very lively atmosphere. There was live music at the restaurant and a community market going on in market square. Our food and drinks took realllly long, but the atmosphere made up for the wait. Upon request, they have a separate menu of vegan and vegetarian options. The fried green tomatoes were delishhhh and so was the squash salad. The couscous dish from the vegan menu was below average. The bread pudding dessert was AMAZING highly recommend. Cool place and I would go again :)"}
{"text":"Our second visit to NOLA was a long time after our first.  We last came here when NOLA first opened.   What impressed us most the first time, the quality of the service and the food, impressed us once again.  I had jambalaya (again) and my wife had the blackened redfish.  We both loved our meals, even though we took home a lot of them.  Anton, our server was very attentive and evened offered to hold our left-overs until after the show we were attending.  We asked to be seated in the back, away from the bar and were taken to an attractively decorated room off to the side and well away from the noise of the bar.  From my seat, I even had a bit of a view into the workings of the kitchen.  We remarked that the noise level was actually lower than what we usually experience in other restaurants.   We had recommended NOLA to several friends, and the feedback we got from them wasn't positive.  Some complained about the service and  everyone complained about the noise level.  Our seating in the back would explain the difference in the noise level, but regarding the difference of opinion as to the service,  that I can't explain. All I know is that on both visits, service was superb.   We'll try not to wait so long for our next visit!"}
{"text":"The happy hour lasts about an hour past every other one in town! Loved the drinks! We had flatbread, stuffed mushrooms and pierogis. The pierogis were ok, I've had better but definitely homemade. The flatbread was good. We were there for appetizers."}
{"text":"This place would have been at least a 4 if I hadn't been to New Orleans last week. My food was pretty good. I got the Jambalaya. It needed a bit more of a kick, so they provided hot sauce, but that's really not the same. As mentioned in the other reviews, the red beans and rice was amazing, and the quail that my brother got was awesome. My problem came with the ambiance, the price, and the beignets. Even though my group was seated in the dining area, the jazz music overwhelmed any conversation that may have been had. We also got the beignets for dessert and they were more cake-y and dense than any other beignets I've had, resulting in a really underwhelming desert. On top of that, the price was a bit high for the quality of food. I would recommend this place more for the bar and music than for the restaurant end."}
{"text":"I have been to Nola twice - the first time as a willing foodie, the second as a prisoner of social graces. The only enjoyable dish here, in my experience, has been the eponymous 'Nola Salad.' It's really a lovely salad - the candied walnuts, arugula and fresh goat cheese are definitely a winning combination.

Unfortunately, everything else suffers from the too much salt, too much grease or too little taste malaise that seems to be the defining characteristic of Nola. Even the jambalaya - their signature dish - was one dimensional and salty. 

So.

Long story short:

Is Nola conveniently located in Market Square? Yes, BUT that shouldn't stop you from going to the other excellent restaurants that are in the same area or nearby (Eleven, Sienna). Extra star for the yummy salad."}
{"text":"My work group has been here a few times for happy hours and I think we're all pretty happy with the place. Drink specials are decent and service is fast.

And they have really great happy hour food specials. $1 for a small bowl of gumbo really hits the spot during happy hour."}
{"text":"The jambalaya is great, they can make it as spicy as you like. Paired with a Purple Haze....didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Nola for awhile . We finally made it there last night. I would give this place a HORRIBLE review.  First I had the French quarter chopped salad.  The ingredients listed on the menu made the salad sound amazing. It was absolutely tasteless. The lettuce was ice cold. It literally tasted like ice cold lettuce with a drop of dressing on it. I then had the crawfish flatbread. Once again the Ingredients on the menu made the flatbread sound delicious...... Once again tasteless.  The service was okay but the price was outrageous for how tasteless the food was.  My fiancée had the jambalaya.  The jambalaya was good.  But it definitely was not good enough to pay $29 dollars for a small bowl of it. I would definitely not go back to this restaurant.  There are many more over priced restaurants in Pittsburgh that serve much better food. Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch which includes a starter, a cocktail and a main dish for $25.  A very different menu and it was great.  I had e cajun pastrami and eggs which were served with Lyonaisse potatoes.  Everything was awesome.  Flavors were very different.  Also had the grits - yes grits - and the apple crepes.  My son has the pumpkin waffles and fruit with granola as his starter.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"As good of a restaurant as I have ever eaten at. The food was amazing, the service was excellent. I ate here two nights in a row and it was amazing both nights. First night, Shrimp and Grits and an amazing waiter named Chris. Tonight, Venison Chili, Seafood Jambalaya and a free beer. I'm eating 2500 miles away from home and feel like I'm having dinner in my dining room. Too cool."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food. Oversalted, overcooked, the fried alligator had more breading than alligator, the beignets were flat and not crispy at all. Skip this one."}
{"text":"far and away the best food and atmosphere of the 3 restaurants in this , for lack of a better word, chain.

Trully authentic Creole cuisine.  Loved the po'boy"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend when we were on our way home from vacation. Saw that there were great reviews on Yelp & all those reviews were spot on! 

We got sat at a high top table in the front of the restaurant, and had ordered drinks shortly after. The manager came up to us about 5 minutes later to ask if we wouldn't mind moving to their dining room because the table we were sat at was reserved. We didn't mind, especially when he offered to pay for our first round of drinks!! 

We ordered the gator bites for an appetizer, which were amazing! Neither of us had had gator before, and it defied our expectations! The breading and seasoning was so delicious. For our meal, we both ordered the gumbo and a Shrimp Po Boy sandwich to share. We got the gumbo first and it was so simple, but had tons of flavor!! There was tons of okra in it, which is one of my favorite vegetables. Then came the Po Boy! Which is huge, btw. The shrimp were easily the size of tennis balls, lightly fried, with a slaw sauce and I'm pretty sure their bread is homemade. To top off that sandwich, were easily the best French fries I had ever had. My boyfriend & I are French fry junkies. We both agreed this was #1 on our top French fry list! 

If you are in this area, I definitely recommend Nola, if you like New Orleans type food. I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live so I could eat here all the time!!"}
{"text":"NOLA has been on my list for quite some time and I'm happy to report that my first experience was pretty good overall. I went with a group so I got to sample everyone else's food too!!

We started with the frog legs and fried alligator. I preferred the gator to the frog legs. 
I had the shrimp and grits, which was a massive portion. It was good, not as spicy as I expected and slightly on the greasy side, but I ate around the puddles. We also had the steak frittes, seafood jambalaya, red fish and the cat fish. No complaints from the peanut gallery regarding their meals. 

I'm anxious to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Great food but slow slow service !! They think they are at its peak in terms of upscale dining scene in pittsburgh , but they have a lot to catch up !!"}
{"text":"I went to NOLA for lunch with 3 colleagues. I got the salad and sandwich option, the NOLA salad and the catfish po' boy, which also comes with their fries. The po' boy is usually beer battered but because I can't have certain fried foods, the server checked with the kitchen and suggested that I get the catfish blackened. The salad was great, I always get it in my combo meal, and the fries were hot and perfectly seasoned. The blackened catfish on the sandwich was so good, exactly what I wanted. I enjoyed the sandwich overall but I think the sauce on it was just mayo and this made it bland. If there was a spiced aoli on there that would have made it outstanding. This is why I rated this meal as a 4 instead of a 5. Service was great and I really enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"On a busy night on the square it may be your only choice...food is sub par.  Rice in my gumbo was hard/uncooked....the catfish meal was $20 & it wasn't anything I'll ever remember, other than it was $20. The beignets are a total joke, not even close to a beignet...if you're lookin' to find NOLA food in Pittsburgh, you won't find it here. Gross sticky tables too."}
{"text":"We tried their jambalaya and po-boy shrimp. The jambalaya was modelately spicy but kept good flavor. Shrimp po-boy was de-licious!!!!! They have a special cole slaw that was tangy and went well with the meals we got."}
{"text":"There was a piece of paper in my $30 duck dish. They took the plate away, didn't bring anythig else and still charged me full price for it. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The service is great (been here 2 times), the food is tasty, and the atmosphere is appropriate for the theme. I had the jumbalaya, the NOLA salad with scallops added, blue crab etouffee, & bananas foster mousse. Everything was great. My favorite was the etouffee. The jumbalaya was baked in a iron skillet and any sauce that should have been in there when served was baked out. I like it with some sauce running around. Therefore, I picked out the meat and left most of the rice. But the shrimp and especially the scallops were awesome."}
{"text":"To our embarrassment our stinger was made with green creme de menthe.

The pasta was just loaded with oil, loaded!

The apps would have been tasty but sauces and sweet coverings ruined them .

Service  is good , the band is festive."}
{"text":"I had a great time at NOLA!   It's different and fun and definitely a place I would go back to.   We had a reservation after spending a few hours at the PPG ice rink.  We were seated promptly in a little table near the kitchen.  The décor is New Orleans style, but a curious mix between casual and fine dining.  Overall, I thought it was pleasing.  The place is way bigger than it looks for the outside.   

All of the food was great.  I highly recommend the alligator appetizer, the catfish entrée, and the seafood mac and cheese (it wasn't called that, but you'll be able to figure it out).  Our server was friendly and prompt.  Definitely a good date night place.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"We recently for a client meeting there and had a reservation for 14 people. Were seated timely in their upper level room. The server was knowledgeable and knew the menu by heart. I ordered the Steak Frites et Salade and was not too happy with it. The fries were on the mark and were freshly made and the salad was average, but i was hugely disappointed with the Hanger Steak (Medium) what was chewy and cold as if it was lying for a while until they prepared everyone's order and ready to serve. The ambiance was average and the carpets could use a makeover too."}
{"text":"I love cajun and creole food. LOVE IT. I know this isn't New Orleans and what can you expect from a Pittsburgh restaurant offering cajun food. Well, how about some crawfish??? Is that too much to ask? None on the menu. None available off the menu. Zero. Considerable disappointment. Oh, ok, you can get excited about the novelty of alligator bites. I've had alligator in every form (including ribs) all over the Gulf states and in a dozen restaurants in New Orleans, and these are nothing special. They're good for an experience and to tell everyone you ate alligator but how much joy do you get from that. You won't order them twice.

I'm a jambalaya afficianado. NOLA's is complelety unremarkable. Wait, I take that back. It's remarkable in it'soddity - they use 3 whole chicken wings for the chicken component. Messy and not a good call. And where's the mudbugs? Jambalaya needs crawfish!! And where's the ettoufe? Nowhere, that's where. 

I love Abita beer and they have  a good selection. But that's about the most positive thing I can say about the place. Sure, it's a novelty. Yeah, it's a great place to take your out of town guests for someplace new and different. But if you ask me, it's not a place I'd recommend. Go once. You'll agree with me."}
{"text":"2nd Visit - Drinks and Appetizers.

I highly recommend the Pork Belly / Corn Bread appetizer.    It was extremely satisfying with my adult beverage."}
{"text":"I don't know, it's a nice place, but I really felt that the options were kind of limited, especially for vegetarians. It's also kinda pricey and I paid about $12 for a salad that didn't leave me satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I both had excellent meals at this restaurant. I had the grilled catfish which was perfectly spiced over mashed potatoes. I asked the waiter to make s suggestion between the catfish and the voodoo pasta and he recommended the catfish. Great choice. My wife had the special which was a seafood pot pie and she raved after every bite This dining experience was so good that I sought out the manager on the way out and thanked her for the way her staff performed."}
{"text":"As out-of-owners we went to Nola on the recommendation of a Pittsburgh local and we were not disappointed. Glad we were not deterred by the noisy bar scene at the front of the restaurant, however, because the dining area was well insulated from the noise level at the bar.  This is convenient to Heinz Hall for those attending a concert, and the Cajun style food was well prepared."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. We went for pre dinner drinks I had the blackberry old fashioned which was great but all the cocktails looked good."}
{"text":"It pains me to only give NOLA 3 stars, but I have to.  As a former resident of Baton Rouge, I expected a little more from this restaurant.  That's not to say that the food isn't good - it is good.  It's just not as Cajun/Creole as it should be.

I started with the Abita Amber (which they have on tap!).  We then ordered frog legs and the alligator to start.  Both of these were solid.  The frog legs seemed fresh, and the gator was not chewy.  The sauce that came with both of these dishes were tasty with a little zing.

I had the seafood mac and cheese, which had lobster, crab, and crawfish in it.  The flavor of this dish was great, and the cheese bits that got darkened under the broiler were to die for.  Please note, though, that the locals down in NOLA don't eat lobster...

I'd love to see an etouffee added to the menu."}
{"text":"We came here for a non-Valentine's-Day Valentine's Day dinner on the 13th (because I like to avoid the actual-day rush at restaurants), and this was a fantastic non-traditional romantic dinner.

First things first, you can't come here and not try the alligator.  Our waitress recommended it, and I'm so glad she did.  Imagine a cross between popcorn chicken and fried calamari with a spicy aioli dipping sauce: that's what the alligator was like.

We also loved our entrees, but be warned, they are gigantic portions.  I got the cajun pork chop, which was easily enough for two meals, and my husband got the scallops mac daddy, which looked like two pounds of homemade gourmet mac n cheese.  Flavors were great, and I loved the little bit of spicy kick in everything.

NOLA also has a sizeable specialty drink list, so we tried a few New Orleans-inspired cocktails from that.  They were healthy pours, and a decent price.  I'm not much of a bourbon drinker, but their Bourbon Street Blues cocktail was pretty good.

Finally, you have to spring for dessert, and you have to get the beignets.  They're like a donut and a funnel cake all in one, loaded with powdered sugar, and served alongside a trio of yummy sherbets.  I mean it: no matter how much you eat beforehand, save room for this dessert!

NOLA also hosts live music and special events (like an upcoming Mardi Gras celebration).  They're located in Market Square, but they also have free valet parking if it's crowded and you can't find a spot for your car.  We loved it, and we'll definitely be back (for more alligator)."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat outside and the waitress was extremely rude. Left before we even ordered because it was so bad"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this visit. Went with friends to watch the live music. Hostess told us the bar tall tables were open seating so we waited for one then when we went to sit down, were told there was a list, but that we could have the next one opening up.  Waited again, sat down, then were told that it was promised to someone else too. We finally got up and left. If there's no seats at the bar where they give you great service, best to leave because the hostess has no idea what's going on."}
{"text":"Three stars for our waitress, alone! She was absolutely amazing! But the food took entirely too long to come out, was really expensive, and REALLY mediocre. We came because of their \"vegan menu,\" but they only had rice available for my vegan coworker. Both of my boss' steaks came out overcooked. The jambalaya tasted spicy, yet lacked flavor (think El Monte canned tomato paste mixed with raw peppers). My other coworker had the shrimp and grits and had to force herself to finish, as it was over-seasoned. I hope our phenomenal waitress takes her talent somewhere that deserves it! I would not come again, at these prices."}
{"text":"If you can only eat one dish and have one drink from their menu... get the fried alligator and the hurricane...NOTHING on this menu matches up to them! I have tried several other dishes on the menu including the flatbreads, seafood jambalaya, shrimp and grits etc...these are all good... but these guys sure know how to make some mean Fried Gators!! This dish is sooo delicious that if you go in for a late dinner (ie after 8:30 pm) its ALWAYS sold out!...i have only gotten to eat it twice of the 8 times I have tried ordering it...Sigh!

The restaurant is conveniently located at market square in downtown and is bubbling with life....especially during the weekends ...it is hard to find a seat even at the bar. They usually have live music on the weekends which adds to the ambiance...

This restaurant is like a piece of New Orleans in the heart of Pittsburgh...Worth a try!!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Nola for dinner and drinks while on biz in Pittsburgh...and YEZZIR this is a good spot!  If you go, you gotta try the Scallops Mac Daddy...good stuff!  Had some live music poppin and drinks were flowing.  Right in Market Sq so overall nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice place. In the heart of downtown. I can say that it is a nice local bar :) with a great food. My friend got an alligator, for me it was a little bit fattie but it tasted good. I got a salad with a catfish which was very good. Large variety of beers and full bar. Highly recommend for tourists like us :)"}
{"text":"(Happy hour review only)

I've only been to NOLA for their Happy Hour... and I've got to say I was very happy during that hour!  Their drink options are average, eh, not bad....BUT food prices blow me away!  Gumbo for $1.  Rice and bean, also $1.  Half off their flatbreads (margarita was great, the other one was way too oily).  It's probably all I will ever want from NOLA.

I will be interested to return on a lunch hour next."}
{"text":"I love NOLA, we've been here twice. The selection are always pleasing to our large crew. A nice selection of cocktails and daily specials. My only complaint is to have the live music go on a little later.  I love the live jazz music but a 7 pm reservation becomes  a yelling match for conversation. Will definitely return .. note to self ask for medium spice on the jambalaya."}
{"text":"Loved it. Went on Sunday afternoon and everything was great. The staff was very friendly, the bar/restaurant was very clean and the food was fantastic. I got the fried chicken and waffles with chorizo gravy, and it was exactly what I'd hoped for. My friend got the club and she enjoyed it, but I don't think it was anything to write home to mom about. However, we shared the beignets and they are AWESOME. I didn't want to share after I tried mine. They were like fluffy little pieces of heaven, floating around in a sea of powdered sugar dreams. Seriously, get the beignets. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I let sister Stenquist pick this one out. I gave up perusing Yelp from my Hotel bed and we just stumbled into market square hoping something would be open before 11am on a Saturday. Oddly not a lot opens before 11am in Pittsburgh. And alcohol before 11 and after 9pm seems to be frowned upon. And makes me frown.

But as we sipped our mutual coffees, she decided on this place since it didn't exist when she used to live out here. We were seated super fast and the service was super. Fantastic waitress and not an ounce of complaint. I was just really bummed with how bland and flavorless everything tasted. 

We split an order of fried green tomatoes. Which, are huge and have a ton of additional decoration on top that doesn't seem necessary. Sprinkled cheese with greens is weird. Not to mention the batter just didn't seem right. I just like simple, normal sized battered green tomatoes. Frown. But that wasn't where I was even terribly disappointed. The sandwich and soup or salad combos both failed. At least, my sister's sandwich was better. She got a creole pulled pork and I stuck with a creole cordon bleu. It was charred chicken with bacon and swiss cheese. So freaking dry I could scrub the dishes with the chicken. There wasn't any sauce on the pieces of bread either that seemed to have come fresh out of a cooler. Her rice and beans tasted obviously canned. Both of our sides of fries tasted like mesquite wood chips. I ate about 2 or 3 of them and gave up. The best thing I had in all pure honesty was the side salad. Because I would find it incredibly hard to eff up a wedge of iceberg lettuce. I hate to give this a bad review because people seem to enjoy it. But I really like to eat and I ate about only half my food."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Abagail made great recommendations. Ordered the Eggs Bene app, when she saw the egg wasnt runny enough she took it back without any hesitation and it came out perfect. The star of the show was my Pork Osso Buco, it was the best put together dish I have ever had. The pork was cooked perfectly to fall off the bone. The blacked eyed peas, roasted brussels sprouts and spinach blew me away. The depth in it was mind blowing, citrus and garlic tones on it. It worked. I will be back every time I'm in Puttsburgh. Abagails service was second to none. Thanks."}
{"text":"Maybe I am just not a fan of Creole/Cajun food. I thought that the food was just OK. The waiter was nice and brought out our food and drinks at a good pace. The carpet and walls seemed a little dirty to me."}
{"text":"This is the best cajun food I've had since visiting actual NOLA.  I've been wanting to try this place since moving to the Burgh and my only regret was not trying it sooner.

From the front (and even in the bar area), it appears fairly small, but once you enter, there is a large dining room way in the back.

We visited on a Friday night without a reservation, so we waited about 15 minutes before a table in the bar was available.  Despite being very crowded, service was fantastic and friendly.  The downside was that it was VERY loud.  Especially once the band started.

We had the gumbo and rice and beans as our appetizers.  Both were fantastic and had a little bit of a kick.  The grit cake and the shrimp and grits were both amazing.

My one complaint is that the prices are quite high.  The food is high quality and the environment great, but $25 for shrimp and grits did seem a bit extreme.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'll be fair, I only tried one dish, but at the moment I'm annoyed - and starving.  I ordered shrimp & grits, which is a lunch entree.  The other plates I could see around me looked generous, big sandwiches, lots of fries, or a big bowl salad and half a sandwich on the side.  My entree was more expensive than the sandwich plates, and  it came with ... nothing.  I got a gigantic plate-bowl with about half a cup of grits and four shrimp in the bottom.  An appetizer sized portion at best, and no bread, crackers, salad or anything else.  The grits were bland and runny, and the shrimp was overcooked and too salty.  Basically, this \"main course\" was a small cup of mediocre soup for $20."}
{"text":"I think the restaurant was okay. It's in the market square do it's a bit self important . The food is okay, I don't get an authentic NOLA vibe . True southern way crawfish and pull them apart, it's just what we do and how we prefer to eat crawfish. 

I had a wedge salad and asked for no tomatoes. I got a wedge salad with tomatoes. No biggie, I just picked them out. We then had to ask for silverware, not that the runner cared. We also had to edit for napkins. This is not including the long wait for service or the okay food.

Overall, I'd go back just not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Second stop here in a second city, have dined here in Downtown Dallas as well. To its name obviously bring New Orleans flair, but traditional Pennsylvania incorporated as well - with delicious pirogies. Not a veggie eaters paradise, but the pirogies were stuffed with creamy mashed potatoes, really a hit - and the NOLA salad was fresh, with crisp produce. Service was pretty good, not over the top, not any complaints. Right inside the market square, still easy to get to PNC Park afterwards."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh Nola - now when this place opened everyone talked about it and loved it and raved and I never went. Finally this weekend I got the chance to experience and I thought it was great. The wine selection (which was what I wanted) was great and to be honest I just wanted some pasta so when they turned out to have pasta I was a happy camper. I very much recommend the dish I had, the Pasta Pontchartrain. There was a little kick to the sauce and the meat and crawfish in the dish were perfect.  Everyone in my party had a great meal - I'm pretty sure the grit cakes were called the best meal my dining partner had ever had. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the environment was fun -I'm going to go ahead and highly recommending trying this place."}
{"text":"Taste nothing like food in New Orleans. Maybe they can fool people in the area because they are so far from N'Awlins. My appetizer came out waay after my entree. However, the waiters especially the host guy were VERY friendly. Great customer service here, poor food"}
{"text":"Great spirits from the TOULOUSE MARTINI (Vodka, Ginger Snap, Pineapple Juice, prickly pear Granita, Mint) to get me groove of thethe NOLA music in the background.

Once my food arrived, the smell of the deliciousness as I heard the sizzling of my Jumbalaya (Carnaroli Rice, Wild Caught Shrimp, Sea Scallops, Chicken, Andouille).  Nicely seasoned and the heat from the spices was just right.  I could tell when at the end of my dish I was snifflin' a little.  That is usually an accurate indicator of good dish.

To finish of my meal, I had to end the night NOLA style...an order of Beignet, which came with 4 pieces and two scoops of blackberry sorbet.

I was completely satisfied and will definitely be coming back for to try the Shrimp and Grits."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday when downtown for a conference. It was just before 1 and I was able to snag an open seat at the bar. I did a half-sandwich and salad lunch combo, which also came with fries, for $12....I have a hearty appetite and I couldn't even finish it all. Fries and panini were hot, and salad was crisp and not overly doused in dressing. Lot of vegetarian items, too. The bartenders were very friendly. I don't get downtown often so I was really glad to try out NOLA and will be back!"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable and polite service and good food. Had the salmon and etouffe. Good size portion for lunch, great flavor as well. Glad I had the chance to try this place while here on business."}
{"text":"Great meal, Great atmosphere. Fast, friendly service.

Met a friend for a late lunch, and it was perfect. By 2 pm, the lunch Rush was gone and we received fast service from a team
Of servers. I had grilled catfish, she had seafood jambalaya, both dishes were excellent. Best part was the sweet&spicy martini, mango and jalapeño. Yes please!"}
{"text":"I go to NOLA for one main reason...the Seafood Jambalaya!  I has huge shrimp and scallops and just the right heat.  And I can handle that heat.  Andouille sausage and chicken are in there, too.  I was stuffed and didn't even finish it all!  
Oh, and don't forget to have a cocktail.  I had the Cajun Martini.   Wow, that one is spicy hot!!  It's really tasty, especially mixed by Troy the bartender."}
{"text":"Super slow.  
Came with a table of 8 for brunch and were seated promptly since the restaurant was essentially empty.  Orders were taken and it was a solid 50 minutes before our food arrived.  When we asked about the timing we were given some lame excuse about how there were orders in infront of us, but like I said the restaurant was empty when we got there...

Food ranged from awesome (French toast special) to passable (most everything else).  Service was polite engaged and friendly, but somewhere between the front and the kitchen there were big problems.

I won't come back."}
{"text":"I will try this place again.  I'm convinced I got the wrong thing.

One thing though that was very very right was the fried alligator appetizer.  OMG it was great.  Perfect.  One of the best appetizer's I've had in awhile.  

I got the pulled pork po'boy and I think this is where I went wrong...it was more or less just a pulled pork sandwich.  Which, when looking back, I\"m not sure what else I had expected, so I think its my fault.  Next time, I'll get something more New Orleans-y.  Great atmosphere, seated right away, very pleased over all.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his burger.

And scanning their code on loyaltree gets you $5 off your check.  Nice."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the bar. At exactly 8:43pm on a Sunday after the Steelers home opener, we were told they just had last call. Bartender then promptly walked away. The don't close until 9pm on Sundays. I understand we were close on our timing, but we were denied dinner prior to closing time."}
{"text":"The food was good, but definitely not five star.
We started with the butternut squash flatbread, and something about it was way too sweet. Maybe it was the maple glazed andouille? I didn't care for this dish. The NOLA salad (dinner size, $5) was good, however. My favorite dish was the crawfish tapenade, which is much like a personal-sized pizza. The saltiness from the kalamata olives was nicely balanced by the sour dressing on the abundant arugula.
There was a rather-loud band playing out front (A friday in January, about 8pm) and we were able to get a table for six in the back, without reservations, where it was quieter.

It's annoying that the menu they hand you does not list the vegetarian options they have available; ask for the vegetarian menu. The excuse we were given was that the type would be too small if they added the vegetarian options to the existing menu. That excuse would not apply to the online menu listed at http://www.nolaonthesquare.com/menu.html , but I don't see the vegetarian menu items listed there, either. Weird."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is good, found the pulled pork bland and the service soooooooo slow - and there is no one here (I wonder why...) If you decide to come here block off 2.5 hours because that's how long it takes to get served for lunch. Next time I am back in Pittsburgh I am going to pass on coming back here."}
{"text":"Meh. I was sick and in the need of some soup or something warm to soothe my the throat.I came across this place and wanted to try the gumbo. I ordered it to go, and had my husband pick it up and bring it back to the hotel. The gumbo wasn't what I expected, the flavor was so so. My husband ordered the fried green tomatoes and a flat bread. Both were gross, the flatbread was lukewarm when he picked it up, he even arrived earlier than the given time. With all the amazing food places in Pittsburgh, not sure why anyone would choose to come here."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with Nola as the service was extremely slow and I felt the food was average. Lots of fried food to go along with the New Orleans theme but still felt it seemed like traditional American food. Decent prices for lunch though just get there earlier if you are on a time crunch."}
{"text":"We were here for our friend's birthday.  We were sat at a table in the back room which was very cute.  The food was very good.  As for the service it wasn't very good.  I'm not sure if it was because we were slightly off to the back, but we had to ask for refills multiple times and had to wait pretty long for our condiments.  The server maybe have just had an off day.  

The food and drinks were great, but the service was best described as, \"meh\", haha.  It won't deter me from going back, every server has an off day."}
{"text":"We tried this spot over Memorial Weekend. The waitress was very friendly and described the menu thoroughly. In her words, this was cajun creole inspired food \"with a Pittsburgh twist.\" I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think that gets them off the hook with some of the Bayou Purists here.

We tried the frog legs and fried artichoke appetizers. I really enjoyed the frog legs, but I'm not much of an artichoke guy. I had the gumbo for a soup course while my mom and wife had salads that looked fresh and green.

For the main course I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp had nice size, texture, and flavor. The whole dish came together well.

For dessert, I ordered the beignets.  These beignets were heavier or more dense than I was used to.  I did not enjoy them as much as I have at the famed Cafe du Monde, or even at a local church fair. However, even bad beignets are still pretty good. 

We were seated near the kitchen, so it provided some nice entertainment and distraction as we waited. We took our meal very slow, enjoyed some drinks, and ordered each course individually.  We were waiting for a friend and never felt rushed by the staff -- but weren't ignored either.

I like their mixture for the hurricane cocktail. The fresh juices add a lot. 

The bar scene up front was very busy and very loud, but it is quieter in the back and more fit for conversation.  The bar crowd was young, hip, and attractive.

They have valet parking; I think it might even be complimentary, if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"Yay it finally opened! Pittsburgh really needed the southern touch and taste! This place used to be 1902. The bar and set up is still the same just revamped. They were serving red beans and rice for the St. Paddy's day opening. I am so excited to come and have some New Orleans cuisine! Po Boys, Jumbalaya, Muffaletta, and crawfish are shown on the very creative menu. Soon, very soon I will be savoring some NOLA dishes."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Had the flatbread, which was a little burnt. The shrimp appetizer was underwhelming. Service was good. Good wine selection. Would go there one more time to try the jambalaya and alligator meat."}
{"text":"A taste of Nawlins on Market Sq? Close...

Although the drink menu was extensive the actually menu was a bit limited and wordy.  I'm all for describing your foods but, to who's determent?  

I had the fried shrimp which was delicious but, became a bit too much about the 5th shrimp.  My dining companions all loved their food and drinks but, would have loved a bit more variety when it came to actual dishes."}
{"text":"We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday during which the Market Square Christmas Village was active so we were expecting chaos but were surprisingly able to get seated immediately. We were quickly greeted by our waitress and learned that brunch was still in session. 

My wife ordered the French onion soup and Nola salad and I ordered the pulled pork po' boy sandwich. The salad was amazing (all ingredients complemented each other well and the amount of dressing was just right)   and the soup was average. My pulled pork was juicy and the voodoo fries were delicious though the onion rings topping the sandwich could have been fresher. 

With tax & tip we were out the door for $25."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh with a New Orleans twist. During the afternoon it is a little more casual than if you would go at night. They also have love music on certain dates at night. We originally sat outside but then it started raining. Our waitress was great about finding us a seat inside and making sure we were taken care of. I ordered a cocktail which unfortunately was watered down from all the ice they put it in. If a drink is going to cost $9-$10 I would love to be able to truly taste the liquor in it. 

I ordered the shrimp Poboy with voodoo fries (which are fries that are seasoned). Honestly, the sand which was average - there wasn't anything that made me go \"wow!\" Or that it stood out. It still was good though! The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit which would be nice for a couple that want a date night together."}
{"text":"I just haven't been blown away by this place.  I've gone there for happy hour and lunch, so maybe all the great stuff happens for dinner, but I likely won't make it back for dinner b/c of my experiences with hh and lunch.  The drinks are good but I'm not impressed by the food.  For happy hour I had gotten the crawfish flatbread and the crawfish was not fresh and had an overwhelming fishy taste and rubbery texture.  While I expect fishiness to some degree on crawfish, it was too much and distracting.  I couldn't even eat another slice of the flatbread after the first few bites.

For lunch I got a vegetarian sandwich b/c this was a few weeks after my hh experience and I didn't want to deal with another bad fish ordeal.  So while the sandwich was fine, it was lacking some flavor - granted there's probably only so much you can do with veggies, but come on let's flavor it up a bit, this is supposed to be New Orleans inspired.  I will admit that the fries were delish and perfectly seasoned.  That was the only highlight of my meal and my experience at NOLA."}
{"text":"The entrance has a very \"bar\" like feeling with Super Loud music (live band) and people holding beer bottles. at first I was a little worried because I had come here for a relaxing dinner rather than beer and loud music, but the waitress took us to near the back where there was a nice big area with large tables and a relatively quiet atmosphere. It was next to the kitchen. Great quality, thought out food that seems to have been carefully made.  The scallops were amazing in one of the steel pan dishes I forgot what it was called, but overall nice experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure I was going to like NOLA initially looking at the menu, but they really surprised me and were fantastic.   I myself had the Jambayla and split a flatbread with some friends and would order either again.
     The service was fantastic as well both as we waited at the bar for a table and during the meal as well."}
{"text":"I went to Nola with my family, being a very loud party of seven.  We walk in and the atmosphere  is phenomenal. Very New Orleans vibe, fitting exactly what they are going for. Great music and great ambiance.   We sat down and met our waiter, William, who is one of the best waiters I've ever had at a restaurant. He was very knowledgeable  and quick, funny and nice and extremely attentive to everything we asked. So after we get settled, we order our drinks and kudos to the bartender who make us some off the menu whiskey drinks that were to die for. And then appetizers. I'm gluten free  so I have the raw oysters. Phenomenal. Incredibly fresh, half shell, over a bed of sea salt. And then when I think it can't get better, he says the special is a tuna dish prepared over a bed of fresh vegetables. I, of course, order the tuna and It was one of the most delicious  meals of my life. Everyone in my party seemed to love their food and the service was amazing during the entrees. Check out their dessert. Order one of everything because it's impossible to decide which one to get. All are ridiculously  delicious. Overall, amazing staff, drinks to brighten up a bad day, and food that I will go back for over and over."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at NOLA. They have great lunch specials (think half po' boy with fries and soup ). They have authentic Cajun cuisine with an atmosphere straight out of the French Quarter. I love that you have the option of traditional creole dishes like frog legs and gator. Plus you can accompany your meal with their take on traditional New Orleans cocktails. NOLA is definitely worth the trip to experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"There were four of us. Two had jambalaya, one had catfish and I had quail. All of us loved our meals and the service was excellent. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"There was a band playing inside which made it too loud to talk to my wife.  The food was good but overpriced for what you got.  Thus would probably be a great place to hang out and get drinks but not a great dinner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food & great service! Definitely recommend reservations. The crab bisque & seafood jumbalaya were amazingly delicious and made to order"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in here for a few drinks and to listen to the band they had playing.  The bartenders were super friendly and the drinks were awesome!  The band sounded awesome too!  We hung out at the bar for almost 2 hours before leaving to head to the next stop.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in Pitt!"}
{"text":"We only stopped here for drinks, so that is what my rating is based upon.  The atmosphere is nice, love the New Orleans theme.   At 6:30 on a Saturday, we were the only patrons at the bar.  I ordered a cosmopolitan and my husband ordered a Moscow mule.   The bartender was efficient and made wonderful drinks.   The cosmo was perfect and very cold which I love.   The mule was served as it should be, in a copper mug, and also the right mix of ingredients.   Since I liked mine so much,  my husband asked the bartender how he made it, so hopefully I can have one at home now.

We did see some of the entrees and they looked and smelled yummy."}
{"text":"We stopped here while killing some time before Tako opened up at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and came away  happy with our experience. We only ordered a couple of drinks but would've ordered food from their menu had we not intended to eat elsewhere. Their menu looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Sharpie is a wonderful service professional!! She is very knowledgeable of the menu and spirits. She has a great smile and a winning attitude. Very personable and a great conversationalist. She made some great recommendations, and lunch was great. Management: Give this girl a raise and keep her for as long as you can."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good representation of New Orleans food, but wish the menu was a bit broader."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come upon New Orleans cuisine in Pittsburgh, but I should have known: good Creole cuisine is hard to find outside of the Big Easy. Having been to New Orleans, I had an idea of what the food should taste like, and was sorely disappointed. I came around brunch and was really excited to see beignets with a chicory coffee dip as an option. That was an obvious choice. But as a main, at the recommendation of one of the waiters (not the one that was helping me), I decided on the shrimp and grits (was thrilled to see they use Anson Mill grits!) The shrimp and grits came first, smelled amazing... and that's where the excitement stopped. It was four small pieces of shrimp, swimming in a pool of spiced salt, with a small cake of grits hidden underneath. The salt content was unbelievable. It's been a long time since I've eaten ANYTHING that salty. And when I mentioned it to the waiter who had suggested it, all he had to say was \"Oh, that's why I like it\". Great. I didn't even finish it.
Suddenly I was really looking forward to the beignets. But the first course should have been an indicator of the quality I was going to get. The beignets were soggy, with the icing sugar just soaking into the dough... not hot and fluffy, like they do in New Orleans. This was a very poor imitation. 
The icing on the entire meal, though, had to be my very unenthusiastic waiter, who clearly would have rather been anywhere else but there. Aside from introducing himself, very little was said and not once did I see even a hint of a smile. After receiving my food, he disappeared for a long while, I even had to go inside (I had been sitting outside) so I could ask for my bill because I didn't know where he'd been. All in all, a very disappointing experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"The food would have been a 2, but the service and management were a 5, so I settled for 3, and hope to let them redeem themselves.  Here goes... First, we were seated early on a busy Friday night, and they did it with a smile.  The waiter was prompt and efficient.  Our appetizer was boudin.   Now, we are truly Cajun food foodies.  We throw a Cajun food fest every year in our town, and we have dined in some of the finest shacks in NOLA.  We KNOW from Cajun food.  This was not it.  First thing I said was, \"how do you eat boudin without saltines?\"  All jest aside, though, it wasn't right.  The boudin was in ball form, which is fine, but it didn't have enough liver.  It didn't have the good boudin funk.  It was sweet, which was weird, and not very flavorful.   I asked for hot sauce, and they brought me Tabasco ....crystal would have been better, but, whatever.  Second course for me was red beans and rice for me.  Serviceable, not great.  I like big hunks of andouille in mine.   This had none.  It was listed as an ingredient, but I couldn't find it.  Phil got a \"smoked \" Cesar salad with white anchovies.  The dressing reminded me of a creamy dressing you would get at the Colonnade in Atlanta....a rich southern old white guy's restaurant....creamy and flavorless.   Finally, I was very excited about the main course.  The special fish was wolf fish which is an eel-y type thing that has terribly flavorful flesh.  Unfortunately, I finally had to complain (which, believe me, I never do).  I think Lot's wife would have become human again next to this dish.  It was so salty that Phil, who LOVES salty food, said it made his mouth turn inside out.  I tried to make it work by eating the fish with the greens, but the greens were just as bad.   It was inedible.  The side of mushroom and crab Mac and cheese was ok, so I ate that.  Phil's Mack daddy duck had an excellent duck confit on top, but the pasta was really sweet.   He ate all the duck, but the pasta was just kind of gross.   

So, they get up starred because of the service.  When I finally broke down and told the waiter that the food was inedible, he was quite apologetic.  I explained that we didn't want anything, but that we felt the chef should know that the fish special was terrible.  It was early in the night, and it could be fixed.  He then brought the manage over, and he apologized.  Again, I explained that it was fine, we just wanted to let the chef know.  Eventually, they actually comped my meal.  That gesture by the waiter and manage,net is enough to make me think that it's worth another shot sometime.   Anyplace that is willing to listen and cop to their mistakes is a place that I'm willing to revisit.  Hopefully next time I'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"Lunch menu, Lame. OK service, not well executed food. BORING. No real creole food. Waited 15 minutes for our reserved table, and it was not even busy.  Would give a second chance for dinner."}
{"text":"Say what you will about Nola. All I have to say is Happy Hour! They have a $4 menu of both drinks and appetizers. Fried pickles! Po'boy sliders! I can even get a decent martini! There aren't enough places in the city that have a truly great happy hour but Nola is one of my favorites! I don't honestly know if I've ever eaten an item or drank a drink that was over $4.   There is also live music and a patio. Both are beautiful things!"}
{"text":"Terrible service on Take Your Child To Work Day, 4/26/2018. Waited for food for 50+ minutes, which never came. Server didn't bother to give us any update. Finally, when he did, he blamed the kitchen. My daughter was terribly disappointed with the experience. I am not sure if I'll ever put my feet on that place again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and attentive wait-staff who actually give recommendations. Beautiful bar area, wall mural, and open kitchen. Live music 3 nights a week. This is the same team that brought us the top-notch Sonoma Grille and Seviche, and it shows in their glossiness and attention to detail. Their only big failing is that they are a little too conservative with the spices. 

It's not vegetarian-friendly or waistline friendly, but it sure is tasty. The soup and sandwich lunch special may be the best bang-for-your-buck at a higher end downtown restaurant. Don't miss the French Onion soup - which could be a sizable lunch on its own. 

Nola is a good, fun addition to Market Square, and it sure does buzz on a weekday afternoon as well as a weekend afternoon. Stop by next time you're craving cajun."}
{"text":"NOLA is a hidden treasure! I have only been here once, but the environment was awesome and the staff is super friendly! I went during their happy hour (mon 5-7, tues-fri 4-7). They have $4 grapefruit mules! I don't know if this changes ever, but it was delicious, and you rarely find mules on happy hour menus, so this was a plus (also deciding factor)! They have a happy hour menu with select apps and drinks and everything is $4 with 1/2 off flatbreads as well ($5-$6). Pro tip - sit inside because they don't do happy hour outside. I also ordered the Cajun Aricini, having no idea what to expect, but they were so good! The crust was a little salty, but they were basically fried balls of rice and Cajun sausage and they're huge! I will definitely have to revisit NOLA!"}
{"text":"William recommended the fried green tomatoes to me. They were amazing. He was a great server and ready attentive. My first time at NOLA and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Get restaurant with food that is very reminiscent of my visits to New Orleans. The atmosphere is great, the staff friendly, and the prices fair. A must try if you love spicy Cajun food!"}
{"text":"Top quality food and drinks in Pittsburgh's downtown Market Square. This New Orleans themed restaurant replicates the tastes and ambiance of Bourbon Street, while keeping things classy. Though the menu focuses prominently on seafood fare and traditional New Orleans favorites, something is available for all patrons' taste buds. 

Bonus Points: Extensive \"Gluten Free\" menu options"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner in Market Square. We had a lovely dinner with live music, great food and lovely ambience! The frog legs were amazing and so were the crawfish flatbread. We had a large table and our server was so friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend NOLA..."}
{"text":"I could eat here every single night.  The atmosphere is nice and the food is yummy. I had to try the Catfish with Zapps chips, who would have thought it would be so good. I even ate my leftovers and I never eat leftovers."}
{"text":"A special date night started in Market Square and to Nola's. A crowded and hectic entry way soon passed when we were led to a private little booth. We started with the sangria and it was the best I've ever had!  So, my wonderful date and I had a few more of those smooth wonders.
Then for the appetizer:  The fried green tomatoes were amazing. Not sure what the sauce is that comes with them but it makes them pop.  A wedge salad was very good then for the main course I ordered the trout and he went for the jumbalia (can't spell it, but you know what I mean). Totally hot and spicy, it was almost too much for me! My boyfriend and I like to share dishes so we switched mid dinner.  The trout was mild and the rice with it was a great contrast to the hot hot hot Jumba- you know- the Brussel sprout side dish that came with the trout was the only disappointing part of the meal. An odd horseradish sauce made them just not good enough to finish. 
A server with a less than sweet attitude was okay but provided good service. 
The fun artwork added a nice touch. We definitely recommend this place and will be back again! Thanks Nola."}
{"text":"Have to say, used to be my favorite place until my recent visit. Plus recently went to new Orleans and this place is far from authentic. The best thing to order is the blackened catfish. The red beans and rice is not authentic at all. More like red beans chili.  I do come here for the live blues bands and some drinks. But I advise you to go to new Orleans for your southern delights."}
{"text":"I have to rave about this place. A friend and I were out and about on Saturday around 2pm and I really wanted to check NOLA out. We walked in and were seated near the bar at one of the high tables. The first thing I noticed is how much bigger it was on the inside versus what it looked like on the outside. Nice little surprise. I instantly wanted to bop my head to the music and enjoyed looking at the art on the wall. The atmosphere was perfect.

The hostess brought water over and then we had a waitress by the name of Stasha who talked to us about the menu (my first time there) and asked if we were interested in drinks/appetizers. I ordered the Abita Mardi Gras Bock beer and for an appetizer I got Zapp's Potato Chip Crusted Catfish. I was blown away by the flavor/spices of this catfish. It was delicious! Perfectly crispy and a nice, tender flavor on the inside. We were informed that our waitress had a big table she was tending to so we had someone else who came over, introduced themselves, and took our order. Then our lovely waitress came by to make sure our orders were in, which was then brought over by the manager (I believe that's who it was). I ordered seafood jambalaya and let me tell you how much I was in love with it. It had big pieces of shrimp, scallop, sausage, rice, and the spices...ohhh the spices. It was definitely spicy though not overpowering. I loved every bite.

While we were waiting to ask for a to-go box, one of the bartenders walked by and stopped to ask if we needed a box. Good timing. Then Stasha came over and asked us about dessert/got the check. She was so sweet, fun, and had great knowledge of the menu. I definitely appreciated her enthusiasm and interaction with us. One of the great things about this place was the customer service. I mentioned a few different people who came over to help us and they all made our experience that much better. It was the team work that I noticed and loved. You had the hostess, waitress, another waiter, the manager, and a bartender all pitching in for each other, which was so wonderful to see and experience. They did a wonderful job and I'd be more than excited to come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great concept! I love new Orleans and Cajun/Créole food.
Great service, great portion sizes and tremendous atmosphere.
Will definitely he back."}
{"text":"Have been there twice on weekend afternoons.  Food gets an A+ for wonderful jambalaya and bisque, salads, and sandwiches.  Service, however... the first time we went there I attribute it to \"working out the kinks\" but the second time we went and waited about 20 minutes for our waiter, and he was downright RUDE.

Still, the food is so good I'm willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"I just don't understand how this restaurant had such good reviews. I went with 4 colleagues (one of whom is my wife) tonight (Wed. night) and just about everything about this place was terrible.  

We were originally a party of 10, but due to a whole lot of problems, we went down to 5. We told the restaurant ahead of time, but somehow they still put us at a large table for 10. No one could hear each other talk. Half the restaurant was empty and we asked them to move to a smaller table but they said they were all reserved. After enough complaining, they moved us, and not a single one of the tables filled up at any point during our meal (we, more or less, closed down the restaurant side of Nola). 

We ordered red wine which came hot. Not warm. Hot. We trudged through the first bottle figuring this was a fluke, but when the second bottle came, we had to ask to put it on ice for a while to cool it down. Where are they keeping these, by the oven?

The appetizers were actually okay. The fried artichoke was tasty and the lamb ribs were flavorful. The raw oysters however were chewy and bland...a sure sign of them not being fresh at all.

No one liked their entrées. I had the Creole Tartiflette and it was way too creamy. Imagine a big bowl of heavy cream with some potatoes in it. That's the Creole Tartiflette. My wife had the scallops, which the waitress pushed. Imagine bland Mac & Cheese with 4 scallops on top. Two people got the jambalaya which was nothing special. And one person got something else, which I can't recall right now.

For dessert we had the bread pudding, which was okay and the beignets. Has the chef ever been to New Orleans? The beignets were tough, not soft and fluffy like they should be. They clearly left them in the deep fryerfor a bit too long.

This restaurant failed. If you want the New Orleans experience, buy a plane ticket and skip Nola."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited the Holiday Market this past Saturday and afterwards  we wanted to get our grub on so I decided we would try NOLA since I had only been there a few times previously for drinks and wanted to taste their food. We arrived around 1:15pm and immediately noticed, while it was crowded, there were 2 seats at the bar so,naturally,we snapped those up. Service began horrendously, and honestly, that is being quite kind. There were 2 bartenders, a male and a female, who were much more into their own private conversation than any of their patrons. Once they decided to start doing what they are paid to do (and I worked for 5 years in the restaurant industry as a server so I am quite patient and understanding but this was just pure.awful.service.), each one of them had to have walked by my boyfriend and I a minimum of 5 times each. I made eye contact multiple times with the male-and he also made eye contact with me more than once-but we never got an acknowledgement of \"be right with you\" or, even better, \"what can I get you to drink?\" After, and oh yes I timed it, 13 minutes, the female and I finally made eye contact, and she put down two napkins and said \"I'll get you waters and be right back\". I'm sure she could read the look in my eye when she finally did notice us because she immediately went over to the male bartender and reprimanded him for not getting us drinks and menus. Service did get slightly better after this point, however, I already had a pretty sour taste in my mouth from not being acknowledged for 13 minutes.

We both ordered Stella drafts and were given menus quickly. For some reason, although we made it clear we were going to order lunch, the male bartender dropped off our tab for the two drafts. My mouth nearly dropped-$14! Since when has Stella ever been a $7 draft beer?! We only ordered those 2, thank god, so our beer portion of the tab was not going to be any more than that. Now we were given lunch menus, obviously, and I was disappointed that some of the items (like the alligator) were not on the lunch menu. I did like the option of soup (or salad) and half of a sandwich though. I had been wanting to try their gumbo for quite some time so I decided to go with a cup of the gumbo and 1/2 of a turkey cuban sandwich. The gumbo ya-ya was served at the same time as the sandwich, which was also served with voodoo fries. The gumbo contained chicken (I could tell it was dark meat just FYI),andouille, Okra, Filé, and Steamed Rice. Honestly, I did not taste any andouille in my portion and there was, in my opinion, too many ingredients to not enough broth. It wasn't spicy but was a decent flavor-better than canned gumbo at least. The turkey cuban is described as being on a Baked Baguette with House-made Pickles, Creole Mustard, Jarlsberg, and Sweet Pepper Jam. I really enjoyed the creole mustard-it had a nice kick to it but was not overly hot. I did not taste any of the sweet pepper jam on the sandwich so if it was present, it was in a very small amount. The bread was extremely hard and almost difficult to chew, although I could tell it was not stale tasting. The pickles were delicious but I have a thing for pickles.....the best part of my meal,honestly,were the fries. There was some type of seasoning salt with a cajun kick on them and wow-they were so,so yummy! It's kind of sad though when you say the fries were the best part of your meal. 

My boyfriend ordered the Creole Pulled Pork Po Boy, described as being served on a Fresh Baguette with Pulled Pork Shoulder, Slaw, Onion Rings. It also came with the same fries. I was originally leaning towards this sandwich but I'm glad I chose what I did. His sandwich, in my opinion, did not look appetizing at all. The pork looked really dry and the two onion rings on top were about the size of a quarter each. He ate most of it,however, he will eat nearly anything. He was in agreement that the fries were the best part of his meal too.

This experience was rather disappointing as I have wanted to try the food at NOLA for quite some time and was highly looking forward to it. Although I only gave NOLA 2 stars, I do want to come back and try it for dinner when there is a bit more variety on the menu. I just hope when I do come back both the service and the food are improved for that visit."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious.  Best jumbalaya I've ever had.  

Came for lunch at 11:30 and waited about 15 min for our server despite our being one of about three customers at the time.

Our waitress didn't tell us the specials as well which is why I withheld a fifth star.  

Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Loved this place!

We took the boys and they had no problem w/ children in the restaurant.  The boys loved our server and his handlebar mustache!  My oldest obliterated his pizza and my youngest finished his chicken fingers when we left.  I had a ham sandwhich.  I think it came w/ gouda...but it came w/ the apple dipping sauce!  MMMmmmmmm!  I annihalated that sandwhich.  Oh, it came w/ a side of voodoo fries, which were yummy.  Hubs had the salmon and loved it.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came on a friend's recommendation- definitely a good one.  Came for lunch on a weekday so it wasn't busy and our server was very friendly/knowledgeable.  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and had to order a side of the Voo Doo french fries once I saw an order pass by me.  This was my first time getting shrimp and grits and I was very satisfied- the grits were nice and creamy, and the shrimp were huge and plump (although I will say that there weren't TOO many of them, just enough to have a bit with each scoop of grits).  The fries were also great, I think they're slightly breaded and then have some cajun seasoning on them- definitely order a side of them if you don't get some with your order.  The price was about right, a little high if anything.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I came by here one rainy Friday evening for dinner. While waiting to be seated, we decided to split a hurricane. The hurricane was very tasty and strong, I definitely recommend it. For dinner, we ordered the fried green tomatoes, gumbo, and the pork tenderloin. We also had the bourbon ball and beignets with sorbet for dessert. We were told by our waiter that the food at NOLA is comparable to New Orleans' food with a touch of Pittsburgh, and were expecting mediocre food but everything was absolutely delicious and brought back fond memories of my trip to New Orleans.  Service was great as well and the waitstaff was superb. NOLA is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and I am looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I've already given Nola a awesome review for dinner but why not do it again for lunch when it's well deserved. I've been to Nola two times now for lunch and my most recent visit has caused it to climb to the top of my list of favorite lunch spots downtown. Their menu gives you the option to choose between two of the following: half sandwich, salad, or soup. You get the best of both worlds. Why choose just one when you can have both?! My absolute favorite is the Nola salad with the Nola club. It's served with voodoo fries which are probably some of the best fries out there. I've also tried the Caesar salad and the pulled pork po boy but I would not recommend them."}
{"text":"Better than last time. First time since remodeling.  Nola salad was decent.  It had mixed greens and roasted nuts. The jambalaya improved from the last time i had it. On the expensive side for $27.  Wish it had more seafood and less rice. Tough to eat here on an expense account. Drinks are around $10. Add tax and tip and you have 40 bucks and i just had water. 50 dollars per day doesnt go far.  Service was ok. Nice to sit outside. Water refills were slow with a spicy dish. Had to ask for bread and then it was nothing special."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week and we were able to get a table walking in with no reservation. I didn't realize how deep and far back the restaurant went, but there were a lot of tables in the back. 

I am from Houston and I have pretty close access to real cajun food... that being said, I ordered a shrimp po boy and was sad to see that it wasn't quite the same. It was so close, but yet so far. Instead of putting just mayo, lettuce, and tomato, they used coleslaw which changed the entire taste of the poboy sandwich! I was not excited about this!

The service was fine, just disappointed as it was definitely not authentic cajun food... so beware if that's what you're expecting!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm from New Orleans so I have high standards when it comes to N'Awlins food.  Overall this place was pretty good when it comes to places outside of New Orleans.  

The gumbo and crab etouffee were made from a nice roux and were properly flavored which I was impressed by.  I would've liked a bit more meat in it and some French bread on the side though (that is the only proper way to eat gumbo!).  When I asked for some bread I was informed there were 2 choices which were a \"complimentary baguette\" or cornbread for a charge.  I was wondering why we weren't offered this complimentary bread in the first place and by the time we got it we were almost finished our gumbos.  And the bread was cold and not actually French bread.  I long for that flaky airy bread that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside that is so ubiquitous in New Orleans. 

We also had the fried gator appetizer which was tasty though could have used a bit more of a kick to it to spice it up a bit more.   I tasted a friend's jambalaya and another friend's cheesy scallop pasta and both were really good (though the scallop dish was not a typical New Orleans dish).  

I had asked about the oyster appetizers which were market price but they were very expensive ($28 for a dozen or $12 for 4, no half dozen options allowed).  I asked the waitress if they were from the gulf, and she disdainfully replied that actually Gulf oysters are small and tasteless so they get theirs from Rhode Island.  Umm seriously? You are trying to celebrate the food of N'Awlins and you just dissed our oysters?  Gulf oysters are delicious and often quite large.  I grew up on them so I was offended by her comments.  And the oysters they served that my friend got were actually super tiny -- tinier than anything I ever get in New Orleans.  And they were not served with the proper accoutrements (Tabasco, horseradish, etc.).  

It would have been nice if the PoBoys or Muffaletta sandwhiches could be ordered for dinner but they are only on the lunch menu.

We also had the bread pudding which was very good, and the red velvet ice cream was an unusual touch.  

There was a small jazz band playing in the bar area which was a nice touch, especially for a weeknight.

I'd go back and I think they did a decent job for being so far from New Orleans.  But I think there are some basic things they could work on that would make this place even better and more authentic."}
{"text":"An update on NOLA that evening....
The manager ended up comping what we had ordered prior to us leaving, which was the right thing to do."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for classic Cajun & Creole ... NOLA was just the ticket! Ordered the Oyster Po' Boy. Oysters were jumbo, fried to perfection. Lunch service was quick and friendly. It came
With a side of Voodoo fries - they tasted just like the voodoo chips they have everywhere in New Orleans! I will go back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  My filet was cooked perfectly, great atmosphere.   I Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Let me say this. I am so thankful I did not review this place after my first visit. I had went during their grand opening phase it was not what I anticipated at all, however, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience this week.

As a person with a sensitive stomach I am nervous to try many different things with unknown spices or possible ingredients I could get sick from. I did try the red beans and rice which were amazing. I definitely would get that again. And it should be good. I mean. If a New Orleans inspired restaurant cannot make good red beans and rice, why is it open?

Since I was there for lunch I knew I wanted a flat bread. The waiter suggested I try the eggplant and chevre. I like it but would not run back to order it again. The flat bread itself was good, I just was not feeling the flavor. In the past I have had the pissaladiere which was very good. I also stole a few of my coworkers voodoo fries which were amazing. Honestly I'd go back just for the fries. The sandwiches all looked great and I really like their lunch combination ideas and the way they are presented.

It is just such a neat place inside. I hate describing things as neat, but it really is. I wish it were more voodoo decorated, but that is just me. I think for it's location (being in the north), it does New Orleans justice. I cannot wait to go back and get the shrimp po boy!"}
{"text":"Parking: there's a garage right across the square that's $5 in the evenings 

Happy Hour: 5-7
Includes half priced flatbreads, $1 red beans and rice, $1 gumbo ya-ya, $4 bites and drinks on the insert

Tip: sign up foe the birthday rewards for Big Y group. You get a $30 entree voucher to choose from at their family of restaurants.

I've been here for happy hour and think it's delicious! Good food, decent portions and a fair price. I went once for dinner and honestly thought that the portions were small for the high price. The meals were alright. I didn't leave feeling wowed. I was glad that the meals were covered by the birthday coupon. I highly recommend going for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times and the atmosphere is nice and the interior of the restaurant seems clean. Service when we went both times pretty quick and the servers were nice. 

I am not a major fan of this type of food as it turns out which is disappointing so I'm probably not the best judge of that. That being said, I do like shrimp and grits which I tried here. I thought the grits were a little bland but it was otherwise okay and I would give it another shot if I came: Also, I have had their flatbreads which I did really like and would try again. I'd recommend it to anywhere coming if you don't really like creole. I have had better food in the real NOLA though of course but this isn't bad. 

Everything here seemed sort of average to me so while I'd come back if someone else wanted to but wouldn't pick it myself."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered the gumbo and the Chef's special, blackened red snapper sandwich. The gumbo had a nice flavor and color to it but I prefer a little thicker soup then this was.  It was also very short on meat and veggies.  Mostly broth and slightly undercooked rice. The sandwich was pretty good, slightly on the salty side but nicely cooked and nicely presented. Overall, nice menu, average food, good service and pretty cool atmosphere.  I'd try the place again."}
{"text":"Market Square is a very nice spot for a plethora of options to choose from for food. NOLA has a great vibe inside. I had the Jambalaya, and it was very good."}
{"text":"Ok food but the service was ridiculously bad. Don't waste your time - and it will be a lot of time. We were seated for over 1 hour before our food came and it wasn't even busy! Waitress had such an attitude when we inquired pleasantly about when we would be getting our food.
Never say never, but almost never going back there. Too many great alternatives to waste your time or money there!"}
{"text":"I have dined here 3 times now so I feel like I have tried enough to give it a fair shake.  To be fair, this is a 5 star restaurant in Pittsburgh but I have actually left the city limits unlike some of my neighbors and dined in cities all over the country.  I would not visit this restaurant if it were in New Orleans.  I own a house there and am there quite a bit so they have a pretty high bar to reach with me.  It might do ok in the touristy part of the city on Decatur St but would certainly close if it were out in the neighborhoods.  

The service has been pretty good.  Although last night we had 3 members of the waitstaff try to take our drink order and give us the spiel.  I was pretty irritated by the 3rd person and had to tell him to stop and tell the others he was duplicating service.  The rest of the night, blessedly, they left us to enjoy our meal.

I like the flatbreads.  I had them the first time I visited.  I also think the pork chop dish is really good.  I don't love the beans and rice.  They've missed here and it's a serious offense for someone who loves this food.  There's too much grease on the plate and there's chili powder or something in there.  It should just taste more like beans and andouille.  I fear they've tried too hard on this one.  I had a perfectly cooked redfish and I like the slaw.  The duck and oyster special gumbo was good but is missing the umami of a terrific gumbo and if it were my first one I would probably have thought it terrific.  The food all the way around is solidly good but I am not a 4 star fan.  It just misses for me.  

If you've never had this cuisine and live here you should definitely go and check it out.  It's a lot of fun and I am sure you'll have a good meal."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and it was great. Service was quick and and I like the location! No veggie items but that is to be expected at a cajun place."}
{"text":"My taste buds are still strutting and waving white handkerchiefs in my mouth they were so happy today!  My very first visit to NOLA was the first of many more visits to come, for sure.  Three of us walked through downtown on a gorgeous sunny day, through the hip and happenin' farmers' market, past the live music in Market Square and through the wide-open doors of NOLA to quite a crowd.  And no wonder....what fantastic food!

I've had shrimp n grits all over the south...NOLA's was one of the best I've ever experienced....and most certainly the best in Pittsburgh.  Cheesy, Anson Mills stone ground grits, at least 8 or 9 great big ol' sweet, perfectly cooked shrimp, smoky bacon, the classic trinity of celery, bell peppers and onion all played together for a sweet, sweet song of the South in my mouth.  

My dining companions both had the NOLA salad.  One had the croque monsieur, the other had the muffaletta.  Both were very, very happy.  

Curtis, our server, was friendly and efficient; Ann, one of the managers, stopped at our table to make us feel right at home.  Heck, she even walked me over to the Chef's Table and told me about the special dinners they hold there.  Nice.

Our table was at the back of the restaurant right by the \"pass.\"  The line moved together in harmony to pump out fine food with exquisite attention to detail.  Serving plates were wiped clean of any stray drips before being whisked away to the lucky recipients.  

Welcome, NOLA!  Make yourself at home and stay a while....a long, long while."}
{"text":"Working downtown, you're always looking for new and good lunch spots. It's nice to see classy joints like this popping up all over the downtown area. Especially in the newly renovated Market Square. When they first started renovating the area, I just had this \"what's the point\" feeling. Market Square was a haven for the homeless and unemployed. Driving property value down, and detracting your average downtown commuter.

I'm happy to say I was sorely mistaken. The face-lift Market Square has gotten has made me look at downtown Pittsburgh in a whole new light. A nice open airy atmosphere with plenty of trendy eateries all around. Sure you can't drive out all of the \"riff-raff,\" but they certainly tried.

A co-worker and I stopped by NoLa to check it out a couple weeks ago. I thought the decor was cool, an over-the-top (in a good way) vision of Bourbon St and Mardi Gras. We both got the Chicken and Andouille Po Boy, which was tasty.  We found the homemade mustard was a bit overpowering though, as it was not evenly distributed and sort of gobbed onto the sandwich.

The service was good. In fact, it was too good. My co-worker and I were approached, no joke, six times by four different people asking how our meal was and how everything was going. This was excessive, and borderline annoying, given that we weren't even there an hour.

Overall I think this place is pretty good, and has the potential to be better. I feel like they are still trying to work out some of the kinks, and once they do, things will definitely approve.

If you love somewhat-pricey cajun food, and are downtown, this place is right up your alley."}
{"text":"This experience was the WORST! 40 minutes after ordering drinks - they arrived- but only because I reminded the waiter 3x that we were still waiting. The wait staff was overwhelmed, the food was below average. Meals: 2 of 4 were 'okay, good' and 2 were not cooked properly and very fatty (chicken). Dessert took another 35 minutes (slice of chocolate cake). They did comp us the drinks but I left the restaurant hungry. There are so many great places to go in Market Square-- do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Limited menu but everything sounded amazing. I settled with the seafood jambalaya-DELICIOUS! Great portion size and generous with the seafood compared to the price. I came during a cocktail hour on a Tuesday which resulted in a bit of a wait but I'm glad I was patient"}
{"text":"Had a couple great experiences here! The live jazz on Friday night is great.  Returned the next night for dinner and was not disappointed. The red beans and rice were seasoned wonderfully...add the shrimp!  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Lovely venue inside and out from the décor, ambiance, pleasant waitstaff, menu options, and taste.

It's much bigger inside than the entrance would lead you to believe.  The inside seating is very charming and atmosphere very soothing.  I have to admit to not being a huge Cajun menu fan but there are plenty of options.  I selected the Seafood Mac Daddy and the portion size and flavors all hit the spot with lobster, shrimp, pasta, and plenty of great cheese taste.  

It was such a nice walk from here to Heinz Hall, as well.  

I'd definitely choose this place for a nice date night, anytime."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and a really great place.
The gumbo was excellent.  The beer selection is very good.  Our server - Tommy was top notch - he took care of us very well.  That always makes the whole experience so much better.  
And - on our way out - I ran into Mel Blount and Joe Green who were coming in to have dinner.  It was a great night!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The cuisine was good.  Haven't tried the jumbalaya yet, but will definitely go back when I get a chance."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had reservations at NOLA before going to see a Friday night performance of Wicked.  We were over 30 minutes late for our reservation due to traffic and weather, but were still seated almost immediately.  We let the host and our server know that we had theater tickets, so we were kind of restricted on time, especially since we arrived late.  

Our server thanked us for letting him know and was very attentive throughout our meal and got us out in plenty of time for the show.  He was also very knowledgeable on menu.  

We shared the Crispy Fried Alligator which was perfectly light and crisp and tasty.  My daughter opted for a bowl of French Onion Soup.  As soon as hers arrived, it smelled so fantastic that I ordered a bowl too.  The veal broth, vermouth and caramelized onions made for a slightly sweet, total delectable soup.   If you love French Onion Soup, be sure to try this one.  You won't be disappointed. 

My daughter got the Steak Frites et Salade.  Perfectly cooked steak, tasty fries and salad.  She enjoyed it.

I got the Seafood Jambalaya.  Perfectly caramelized rice, seasoned with a pleasantly spicy kick,  plump scallops & shrimp, generous pieces of sausage and crispy chicken drummettes.  Definitely another hit. 

And sitting near the kitchen, we could see the desserts and had been eying them since we sat down.  

We decided to share a Bananas Foster.  It was made with moist delicious banana bread pudding, crispy sweet banana fritters and homemade rich luscious caramel ice cream.  Every bite was amazing. 

We'll definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"The shuttle guy from the hotel recommended this place. I realize I am from Texas, so getting good, authentic Cajun food isn't hard. With that said, this place is awful in terms of food. I ordered the crawfish andouille flatbread, and it was terrible. Firstly, it wasn't a flatbread; it was a pizza. Secondly, there was brown oil dripped from the andouille, which made the pizza soggy. Thirdly, because the pizza was soggy, it was hard to eat. I was picking at it so badly that the waiter and the owner talked me into getting another dish.

I decided on the Scallop Mac Daddy. It was better, but not by much. I've decided seafood and macaroni & cheese probably aren't the best combination. The scallops were big (see picture), which was good, but they gave the mac & cheese a weird flavor. I realize the two dishes I picked aren't true NOLA style, but there's no crawfish etouffee on the menu (blasphemy in my book)! In fact, most of the dishes aren't really indicative of NOLA, in my opinion.

The long island was terrible. The bartender used spiced rum instead of normal rum, and this always makes a long island un-drinkable. I had already sent back a dish, so I didn't want to complain about the drink too, but I only took two sips. I left a full drink behind.

The only good thing from the meal was the caesar salad. I don't like anchovies on pizza, but I do like anchovies in a caesar salad. The salad had fresh ingredients, was crispy, and light. But after spending $45, including tip, the meal was not worth it. I will not come here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great atmosphere. I had the jambalaya and it was great. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for creole-style food done right."}
{"text":"So I was at NOLA this past Saturday and actually ordered some food. Of course I mean I started off with my milk punch. That drink is so yummy.

I did a half-and-half soup and sandwich. I chose the gumbo and the pulled pork. The gumbo was pretty tasty, especially when I accidentally dumped a buttload of habanero sauce on it. I thought it was going to be way too spicy to ingest after that snafu, but I think that made it taste better. The sausage in it was absolutely delicious.

The pulled pork sandwich (with onion rings on it, oddly enough) is the best I've had in Pittsburgh thus far. Which is not really a compliment to NOLA as it still wasn't that good and I wouldn't order it again. 

The meal also came with voodoo fries. Yum-my. I would order a side of those at any time, they are so good! I don't know what spices they put on them, but they're great.

We ended lunch by sharing some sorbet, mixed berry and peanut butter. The peanut butter one was great, but I am a big lover of all things peanut butter-flavored. It also came with some fried and sugar powder bread that I cannot recall the name of (and can't find on the website!). It was all delicious.

I also upgrade the rating one star because our waiter was kickass. I wish I could remember his name. He was friendly, humorous, came back and checked on us often enough."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to dine at NOLA after seeing the reviews. I do not understand how this place at the very least isn't a 4/5, but let me tell you, my food was deserving of a 5 star review. 

The staff is incredibly friendly and willing to recommend menu items. After going back and forth with the bartender I chose he gumbo and the catfish. It was fantastic and the flavors were on par with my experience in New Orleans last year. 

Food: 5/5
Staff:5/5"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and the food is not bad. However, if you're looking for authentic Cajun/Creole cuisine, you will be disappointed. Very disappointed. My date and I had the fried green tomatoes, alligator, red beans & rice,and one other forgettable appetizer. Like I said, not bad but not the real deal and pretty unremarkable."}
{"text":"The Frog Legs are 2 die 4! And then the Oyster Stew with artichokes! Great ambiance, artwork and cool hanging lamps! An eminent hipster's paradise! Delicious."}
{"text":"One and Done!
I tried this place today with some co-workers, there were 6 of us in total.  We were seated pretty quickly considering the size of our party and the fact that it was approximately 12:30 or so.  
Our waiter had the personality and friendliness of a rock.  So despite our pretty quick and good start things quickly went south from there.  After taking our order they began bringing out the food roughly 20 minutes later.  That is food for 4 out of 6 of us. 
After 10 minutes our waiter realized that two of us didn't have any food and came over to ask \"what ya order\"?  Apparently the cooks 'lost' our order.  A couple minutes later one more of our party had their food but the last person still did not. 
10 minutes after that the manager greeted us, apologized and said that the last person's meal was on the house, and offered him a free soup in the mean time.  
Everyone was now free of guilt to eat their food as the last member had some soup.  The food was pretty good, but nothing great.
The icing on the cake... our bill was wrong and we were over-charged by roughly $30.  We had to speak with the manager to get that sorted out as well.  
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place!  It started at the door!  There was a band playing with music 100% too loud!  the speaker was aimed right back into the restaurant making talking to anyone almost impossible.  When the host made it up to the host stand after us waiting at least 4 minutes I asked for a table outside.  Her response was and I quote \"Did you see any out there?\"  WHAT?!?  I calmly responded with \"I don't know, I didn't look.\"  She went and checked and sadly there were no tables.  We were placed in a two top on the back of the place by the kitchen door.  Our waiter explained one of the specials as \"the crabs sit on berries, they look like you can't eat them, but you can.\"  Now is that something that would like to order?  Our waiter took our drink order and left, then a busboy came up and faced his back to us while holding a plastic sauce container of water and turned his head and asked \"would you like some water?\"  it was like it was a drug deal and he was trying to be shady about it.  It was very weird.  After asking \"what\" three times because the music was so loud I couldn't hear him and the fact that he wasn't facing me, I just gave up and said yes.  He quickly came back with two wine glasses of water on a tray.  While handing placing the one glass down on the table the other tipped and fellow right in the lap of my dining partner.  Now I have been a server as he was at once also, and we understand that these mistakes happen.  However it was very odd that the busboy gave the wet guest a napkin then went right away to cleaning up the carpet.  That was the tipping point and the proof needed that the guest does not matter.  We decided that it was better that we just leave and go somewhere that will respect us and treat us as a guest should be treated."}
{"text":"Four (4!!!) overcooked shrimp on a whole shrimp po boy for 12 bucks?!? How can they serve this without being ashamed of themselves? Red beans n rice was average at best. Nothing close to authentic. Gumbo? Meh. Bland and boring.

I will say though that the service was above average...though it didn't make up for NOLA's lazy take on Cajun cuisine. This restaurant wouldn't last a day in New Orleans."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable experience!  The weather today is perfect for outdoor seating, and today's special was fantastic.  It is the apple cole slaw that made the po-boy.  It really added a fantastic kick to the blackened chicken.

The service was also stellar.  I was seated right away, where I wanted to sit, and the table service also was quick yet not hurried, and courteous."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to come here and see what the buzz is about! I came here for a diner date and was surprised by my experience. On walking up I was confused by the store front making it blend in as I was expecting it to be \"poppy\". It was a Sunday so on entering it was dead maybe two other tables dining. We where greeted and seated in the back by the grill. It was much different than I was picturing in my head with a name like \"NOLA\" thinking New Orleans and it's colors and liveness. But that's ok because it did have a few cool art pieces. Now for the menu I can say it's a bit updated from what's on yelp and there site. I was disappointed to see there was no frog legs on the menu like I've read about from past reviews. It was much smaller than you would expect from a place like this but maybe it's a good thing cause they can focus more on there main dishes. I decided to try the \"gumbo ya-ya\" for a soup starter. I was impressed with the taste and the large chunks of okra and the meats. The rice was great not over cooked at all. Overall for the soup the flavor was nice I just wish it had a kick of heat. For my main dish I decided on the \"country fried pork chop\" and I'm very happy I did. Now for this  it was so rich with flavors and blended so well it really was a New Orleans style dish. It was a large portion pork chop that was still juicy with that crispy breading coating. The andouille mustard greens where out of this world so delicious and packed with flavor. As for the white rice it was sadly kinda cold and it was noticeable cause everything else was so hot. But the gravy really pulled everything together! A side note and I think it was a mix up because it says the dish comes with a side of \"apple butter\" but I got a side of cranberry sauce. The service was very nice and the waiter did answer questions about the menu. Overall I would return again to try a few other things on the dish."}
{"text":"Stopped in late Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend. We split appetizers of fried alligator and fried green tomatoes. 

The alligator was good, tender and crisp. Think popcorn chicken...errrr alligator. It was plated with a  remoulade dipping sauce. 

The fried green tomato were sliced about a half inch thick, battered and fried. They were plated with sprinklings of cheddar cheese, micro greens and a creole mustard ranch sauce drizzled on top. Normally I am anti-ranch, it has a strong flavor that overpowers most things (think cool ranch doritos....bleh). This was not the case here, the dish was great! Would definitely order again.

We split an order of seafood jambalaya for our entree. They thoughtfully split our dish between two individual skillets which were lined with rice topped with a spicy red sauce, a scallop, 2 shrimp, grilled chicken, and slices of sausage. I wish the sausage was crispier/rendered out more but the seafood and chicken were all prepared great.

My girlfriend had the classic New Orleans drink, the Hurricane and I had a boring plain old Yuengling draft. Would definitely return to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"This place has fell off quite a bit since my first visit. Firstly, they removed the Lobster Mac n Cheese from the menu, which was my GO TO and replaced it with a duck Mac n Cheese (gross). 

Once a month my friends and i do a couples dinner night and we came here. The service was mediocre, the staff wasn't very accommodating, but what saved them was their food. The chicken and dumplings was really good and the alligator is the best thing on the menu, although their portions are the same! My girlfriend ordered the same thing as me and her portion looked like a kid size, she was disappointed. When it was time to order the dessert the waiter took our order only to come back 25 minutes later and tell us that the kitchen was closed, what a huge disappointment being as though there was only 2 other people in the restaurant and nothing slowing the waiter down from putting in our order."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was thoroughly impressed. Service was quick, friendly and very good. We had gumbo soup, fried green tomatoes, po' boys (shrimp and oyster) with fries. The shrimp had a great batter though it was unseasoned. Paired with this sandwiches is a 'pepper jam' that is well balanced as consists of honey and chili pepper. Absolutely amazing jam that could go with a number of items. The shrimp was a good size and tasted fresh. The seasoned fries were also very good. I'll definitely be returning. 

Nola is also a Yelp Cash Back participant, so you'll get 7% of your meal cost sent back to you in cash, as long as you sign up on Yelp for the program."}
{"text":"Came here today for Sunday brunch. There was no wait I was seated immediately with my dad. Service was very good, however, for brunch the menu isn't all that expansive. They have a starter and entree special for $18. I got the beignets as a starter and the crab cake benedict. The beignets were divine. I wish there was more than 2! The crab cake benedict was good. I usually love Cajun food and seasonings, but I feel they over do it a lot. We got the marghertia pizza as an appetizer and it was just okay. I'm not a fan of green tomatoes, and they sort of put a lot of Cajun seasoning on it. But my dad enjoyed it. He got the catfish po boy, it was huge! But he said it was very good. Overall a good experience. I definitely want to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with an old friend from school. Appetizers Friend Green Tomatoes and Alligator were very good. Drinks took forever to come. Dinner portions were varied...but dishes: Jambalya and Chk n Waffles were quite tasty. Second round of drinks came quicker and were better than the firsts. 

Enjoyed the live music. 

Will patron again to try new dishes. 

Pretty pricey."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick drink and a snack. The place seemed promising. We love creole food so we were excited. That excitement quickly turned into disappointment.  

First off, the service is horrible. The waiters and waitresses seems disinterested. And one of our plates were dirty! We tried to signal for a waiter but no one came by so we had to go up to the manager for a new plate. The food was no better than the service. We ordered the sausage and crawfish flat bread. The whole thing lacked flavor and was way too oily for my taste. I will definitely not go back there."}
{"text":"Love Cajun food... but this place is not the place.   Very expensive, food is not that great, decent atmosphere.  Service is decent.  Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past week and was excited to try something new. I ordered the hanger steak and for the most part everything was very good, especially the salad and fries that come along with it. The steak itself was a little low on seasoning. I ordered the meat as medium and received it as basically raw so that was a little disappointing. Overall, I think this place is decent, but over-priced."}
{"text":"I was going back through my old reviews - and I HAD to add a star back to NOLA.  Their happy hour is one of our favorites.  Half off flat breads (which are all insanely good) and $1 red beans and rice or jambalaya.  Don't quote me on this, but I think the draft beer is also $1 off.  There's usually a new flatbread depending on the season, so its nice to always have something new to try.  Since I've been more of a regular here, the food has really grown on me."}
{"text":"We hit NOLA a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night.  We got there pretty early and were part of the show crowd.

The place is misleading, size-wise from the outside - it's pretty large inside, with at least three distinct seating areas.  It also seems as though there should be one table removed from the area where we were seated.  While understanding that table turn $$$ is why every restaurant is in business, it was like dining in a NYC subway car at 6pm.

Seasonal House Sangria was tasty and different.  Of course it included bourbon and also sported a bruised rosemary sprig instead of fruit - Yum!  It indeed tasted like the perfect winter sangria - we both loved it.  Fried Green Tomatoes are an obsession of mine so I couldn't wait to sample NOLA's version.  While they were good, the tempura was overpowering and left me still wanting fried green tomatoes. Two entrees were enjoyed.  I had the Wood Roasted Quail which was served with the best prepared asparagus ever - nice and firm.  The quail was well done and flavorful with both the rice and cranberry sauce complementing the bird.  The oyster dressing was not great; mushy describes both flavor and texture.  My companion had the Scallop and Shrimp Mac Daddy which was served in a cast iron pan and had great flavor.

I would go back only to try out the sandwich side of the menu, as it also looked tempting.  They were very busy, but I feel like if I go in with diner expectation I would be better satisfied with the loud atmosphere, tight quarters and rushed staff.  Muffaletta or Po'boy... sangria can make the jump!

Also - made reservation through Yelp - how much easier can things be???  I wish more restaurants used this feature!"}
{"text":"NOLA is our go-to lunch spot at work. It's pretty great. I have mostly had sandwiches there, so I can't comment on their entrees on the menu. The have solid and interesting food, at a good price. Their fries are can't-help-yourself good. Really. They have one of the best veg sandwiches (Pan Bagnat) I thinkI've ever had. They offer combos of soup+salad or soup+sandwich or salad+sandwich, which is my favorite thing to get. The French onion soup is pretty amazing, salty, cheesy, and with thick chunks of bread under a thick layer of gruyere. Basically the food is great, and I haven't heard anything negative from anyone I've gone there with, with the exception of an off day in the kitchen, that happened maybe once. For a new restaurant, I think they got their chit together pretty quickly, and made some minor changes to the menu after a few weeks, which I think improved the place. I can't speak to their authentic-ness, but they are pretty damn good. 

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is always nice and inviting, with a nice little outdoor area for those beautiful days in the square. They do, however, have one of the worst entrance/lobby/hostess stations in the world. You are basically standing in the middle of the main thoroughfare through the restaurant while waiting to talk to the hostess. And if you happen to have to wait for a table, then you are awkwardly trying to find a place to put yourself with out being in the way. There is basically no where to stand without bothering someone, and that bothers me. It's nice that they have the most amount of seating possible in there, but it would be even nicer if that awkwardness was done away with the removal of one or two tables."}
{"text":"I've been to Nola's a few times before and have always had good experiences. The fully stocked bar always has a \"relevant to the season\" selection of Craft Brews and the staff is courteous, knowledgeable and professional. They offer a New Orleans Nouveau Creole menu with live jazz on select evenings. The outdoor seating with a view of the bustling Market Square presents a wonderful atmosphere (if you're lucky to get a seat) on a hot summer day while the interior provides a feeling of being in a tavern on Bourbon Street (I know, I've been there too).

A couple of days ago during my lunch break I had a hankering for something spicy so I headed over to Nola's and ordered up a serving of the jambalaya. It took only about ten minutes for a hot cast-iron dish to be placed in front of me filled with shrimp, scallops, chicken, andouille, veggies and of course beans and \"dirty\" rice. The spices blended together to make the meal flavorful without being too spicy... a delicate line to tow.  It was truly delicious; I know I'll be back again. Perhaps one day I'll muster up the courage to try the Frog Legs or the maybe the \"Crispy Fried Alligator\"."}
{"text":"The staff is top drawer. We had a large party arrive at prime time dinner hours with no advance notice and still got a wonderful table. It was a spur of the moment thing. The place was packed, and I was worried we would have to go elsewhere, but, no, NOLA was up for this challenge. We were assigned a feisty, diligent waitress who was everything you want in a server and were treated like royalty. 5 stars.

The food was not as sensational but agreeable. I started with the alligator tail appetizer--it was compromised to a certain extent as the batter had too much chili pepper--made it difficult to taste the meat. Once I pulled off the batter, the alligator was tender and of good quality. 

We all shared our various main courses a la family style--so got to taste a lot of NOLA's entrees in one visit. Steak marchand de vin was excellent; blackened catfish was respectable; chicken and dumplings was below average; and seafood jambalaya had way too much heat (and was even ordered less spicy). Also partook of the NOLA salad and the smokey caesar salad and both were just okay. Nothing jumped out at me in terms of the desserts.

It's a fun spot with lots of charm and gaiety. There is live music, and that is a very nice feature however it was almost too loud for us. Perhaps reducing the decibel level during peak dinner hours might be a consideration.  

NOLA is a place where \"laissez les bon temps rouler\" is for real."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner there traveling in for business. I grew up in New Orleans and this place is certainly upscale Cajun/Creole. I had the half of Cajun duck plate. The actual duck was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The vegetable that came with it were good but some of the sauce over it wasn't my style. Not bad just took away from the duck. All in all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My sweet friend took me here one night after hanging out, and I was a little nervous. I don't like to let people pay for me, especially if it's not \"cheap\" food. I was also worried there would be nothing vegetarian. Well, one fear was confirmed. There really is next to nothing vegetarian here. 

I ended up ordering the single item that was. I think it was a flatbread with pesto and tomato. We sat outside listening to the (very loud but good) music and sipping on one of the most amazing fruit-type beers I've ever had. This was in July, so I honestly forget the name of it. I won't forget the taste, though! 

The flatbread came out, and I was surprised by the generous size. It was incredibly flavorful and well made. I typically loathe little tomatoes on top of food, but these were perfectly ripe and delicious. I'm getting hungry remembering this meal. 

Oh, did I mention my meal was $9, while hers was $27? Vegetarians are cheap dates."}
{"text":"Jambalaya is outstanding and all of the entrees have a great Louisiana kick! Staff is super friendly and were very accommodating to my little one! It's also on Market Square which is just a great place to visit when in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Poor service and sub par food overall. First, it took at least an hour to get our appetizer and soups which I'm pretty sure were only brought out because we reminded him... his response was, \"oh I thought you wanted it all out at the same time.\" Not sure where he got that idea.. we ordered the soups and appetizers in addition to our full meals.

Next, of course after we asked, he brought out some rolls. The rolls were hard and so was the butter. Spreading wasn't even an option. 

Mind you we also ordered drinks when we got there. They came out timely, however in the 2.5hours we were seated in our back booth (a table of 6... large enough to have the potential to get a decent tip, but not too large that we were at all hard to handle) our waiter never asked us if we wanted more beverages. He checked on us a total of 3 times throughout our time at Nola and never asked us if we would like to see a dessert menu. We also had to flag him down to get his attention in order to pay for our meal.

The fried green tomato appetizer and French onion soup was the only good part of the entire meal. The portions were small for the price and not anything earth shatteringly delicious.

We will definitely not be going back for dinner. Maybe for lunch if we aren't in any hurry or aren't very hungry."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Food is okay, though not real New Orleans style presentation. I had the jumba yaya soup which lacked a little of the Cajun punch, I didn't care much for the lack of bread on the side.  The entree was the blackened salmon with pecan rice and shrimp etufee. The salmon was tasty the etufee was bland. The dish was good but not four stars. Seems like a popular place although I have found that after six years of travel to Pittsburgh, you don't come here for the food."}
{"text":"Imminently forgettable.  Bland, boring, and tasteless.  I tried the fried alligator appetizer and the jambalaya for the main course.  The best part of the jambalaya is the andouille sausage, and that's not saying much.  The shrimp were as tasteless as the chicken and the rice was worse than tasteless.  And it's not spicy.  A jambalaya that isn't spicy?  That makes as much sense as calling white chocolate chocolate.

They get an extra star for putting in the effort to have frogs legs and alligator on the menu, though the alligator was so drowned in aioli that all you can tell is you're eating fried...something...in aioli.  I got the distinct impression they only have these things on the menu to seem edgy, which is a huge disappointment.

All this with New York prices make for a fairly lame experience.  Granted, this is right in tourist central, but for some reason I was hoping to get more than the usual tourist razzle dazzle and sky-high prices.  I was very wrong."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have never written a review for this restaurant.  How rude!  And now one of my favorite lunch spots is being sold to another local chain. I just hope that the new owners don't screw everything up....  I've seen that happen where a new owners takes over an existing restaurant and decides to make too many tweaks.  Bleh!  (\"Oh, let's just add turmeric to all of the existing recipes and that will be our \"signature\" touch\")  You get my point.  I just feel bad that they have been so negatively impacted by several fires within the business and I'm sure that has screwed around with their business.  However, if you want some decent New Orlens vittles, Nola on the Square will treat you right.

I have had almost their ENTIRE lunch menu.  (I know, that's ridiculous)  You can't go wrong with any of SOUP, SALAD, & SANDWICH DUOS.  Seriously!  Your tummy will be as tight as a drum after eating one of their po boy sandwiches. (Shrimp, Catfish, Alligator or Roast Beef, you can't wrong, especially served with the Voodoo fries.)!   The lunch entrees are bomb diggity too. Shrimp and Grits, Grilled Catfish and my favorite, Poulet Frites et Salade!   Oh my!(Do you know how hard it is to get a chicken crispy on the outside and moist on the inside?  As someone who cooks, it's not the easiest hat trick to pull off.)  The appetizers (Crispy Fried Alligator, Fried Green Tomatoes) and soups (Red Beans & Rice, Gumbo Ya-Ya and French Onion) are also, right tasty! 

I'm trying to stay in town one night for their Grilled Chicken & Dumplings, because I've got a feeling that that dish is going to be off the chain.
My sister, Luch, was stationed in New Orleans and they have some AMAZING restaurants.  However, if you can't make it there, go check out Nola on the Square and I think that you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is great and part of it is covered so if you want to stay out of direct sun, this is the place.  Great view of the square and the fries are really delicious. I didnt like the smoked tomato bisque, it was vinegary, but my boyfriend loved it."}
{"text":"We made it there for restaurant week and it was AWESOME !!!!   We had the shrimp boiled skewer for the app the ribs for dinner and a desert !!! Everything was cooked perfectly .. The ribs fell off the bone !!! The skewer had shrimp sausage and potatoes over a corn like salsa !!!! WOW !!!! Highly recommend it !!"}
{"text":"I've been to New Orleans and eaten my way through that glorious city and I can safely say that NOLA is not really representative of New Orleans food.  The Partner In Cuisine and I split an alligator appetizer, a po'boy, and a mufaletta, but they had been \"Pittsburghized.\"  The Voodoo Fries were just french fries with seasoned salt.  Fortunately for them, the lack of New Orleans authenticity didn't take away from the fact that the food was tasty.  I'll definitely go back  to indulge in some Abita (since it's not an easy find in Pittsburgh) and perhaps the alligator, but I think I'll leave the other dishes for when I go back to New Orleans!"}
{"text":"NOLA is wonderfully located in Market Square.  And it has decent food and great bartender service.  Valet parking is great.  But keep the receipt as we were ticketed by Pittsburgh for not parking .... even though we paid the valet service.... 

NOLA refused to allow for reservations in the \"bar area\" for watching/viewing bands.  We used to go about 2 hours early to wedge our way forward toward the performers.  But the management's view is not conducive to getting decent seating.  We have been there before and told to \"wait\" at the bar, then others come in and get band row seating.... (secret handshake?).  We used to call the manager over and ask for decent seating.... \"maybe.\"

My party of 8 decided, after this call to reservations today before 1 pm, to go elsewhere as we told there could be no assigned/reserved seating toward the band(s).  But others come in and are seated.... 

Sigh.  There are so much better Pittsburgh venues for appreciating music, and having seating/reservation service.  

Amusingly, BJ's in Wexford doesn't take reservations per se but puts one on a priority list for seating depending on traffic.  And they discuss the options and timing of arrival.  Stunningly different customer experience.  

Fred."}
{"text":"I'm used to the real thing in NOLA and Baton Rouge, but this is very reminiscent of them."}
{"text":"I had the BbQ shrimp & House cured pork belly appetizers, both recommended by our waitress. I loved the shrimp, it was so flavorful that I cleaned my plate with the bread. The pork belly was by far one of the best dishes I have ever had. Totally recommend NOLA!"}
{"text":"Nice for lunch and dinner, and fast enough for a work lunch. 

I got the Heirloom Tomato & Wood Roasted Corn salad with salmon added; delicious! The spiced watermelon and pickled radish in the salad are so good - never had watermelon or radish that way. 

Service was quick, and we sat at a hightop near the open terrace. 

They serve yaka mein, which I saw on Anthony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmern (I forget) once, which I am definitely going to try soon."}
{"text":"It is nice to have a somewhat decent, somewhat cajun place north of the Mason Dixon line.  While the food is pretty darn good (not great), I have to give the place high marks for bringing this style of cooking up north.  Keeping with the style, they have several Abita beers on tap, which are hard enough to find in bottles.  The gumbo is really good, but the portion is small and relatively expensive.  The blackened seasoning has been salty, but when I ask for less salt they do comply.  The waitstaff and bar tenders are very friendly.  Stay away from the banana foster bread pudding dessert, it is so unbelievably good and decadent I'm sure you're selling your soul to the devil."}
{"text":"My first time here was a terrible experience. I didn't get served after sitting at a table for twenty minutes. I ended up just leaving. Recently I gave it a second go and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was helpful and attentive. The atmosphere is awesome. I had the jambalaya that I shared with a friend thanks to the waitress telling us that we would be better off sharing. That waitress changed my whole view of this place. I would definitely come back for the jambalaya."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! My girlfriend and i have been here twice; we sat at the bar both times and both servers were very nice and knowledgeable. 

The first time we were there during happy hour and we got the pork belly and the flat bread - both were amazing. The cocktails were very good as well - I had something with jalapeños in it and it was flavorful but very spicy as well.

We ended up going back the next morning to try the beignets - they weren't as good as Cafe Du Monde but they were still worth getting. 

I would definitely go back next time I am in Pittsburgh, sounds like the live music would be exciting."}
{"text":"Wonderful taste of New Orleans cuisine. The hush puppies and the sauce they were served with were very filling. By the time my flatbread ($9) arrived, which was big enough to split as an entree, I had it wrapped to take home. I had to have beniegts wrapped to go fo dessert as well. That was a huge portion, big enough for two to share. They were still warm when we got home. Four, palm-sized, light beniegts coated with powdered sugar, served with sorbet. My husband ordered a cup of gumbo and the featured dinner-blackened kobia (fish) with roasted peaches, chantrel mushrooms, and corn served on endive leaves. (see  picture) Service was excellent, tables were available inside and on the sidewalk out front. Had to wash it down with an Abita brew. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I came here on the day after my birthday because I am on the mailing list for this restaurant group. And as part of that you actually get a $25 certificate to use at any of the restaurants that they have. I mean, how good is that? I have been on the list for a few years now and have never used this perk. Am I an idiot or what? Anyways this year I thought, well, lets start 34 off a little different and use a coupon. We took an Uber down to Market Square. I suggest everyone who is trying to go here to just get an Uber or Lyft and not worry about parking. There is nothing worse than trying to find a parking spot when you know your reservation is soon. Yeah, they have valet and parking garages, but why spend the money and have to drive yourself home (aka no drinking) if you can just request an Uber. Seems like a no brainer to me. 

Sadly I did not indulge in a drink, but after the two weeks of celebrating my birthday, it wasn't that big of deal. The table was ready right when we got there and the service was top notch like usual. Our hostess was really nice and even indulged us a bit when we considered sitting outside instead of inside. We opted to sit inside, as a side not, I am not a big fan of sitting outside usually, especially in the dark, so, we sat inside near the kitchen where we usually head to anyways. Another sad part of Sunday was that there wasn't any live music. I would have liked to hear some fine tunes while I ate. 

Starters:
Oysters: A foursome or dozen; wood roasted bbq or raw half shell. I of course ordered this and of course ate it all myself. Yeah, my partner is not really into the whole raw oyster thing and I absolutely love them. I will eat them each and every day if I could. I will say that they had a little bit of a different take on the cocktail sauce which I do not know how I really feel about. And they then had some sort of red pepper jam cocktail sauce that I liked, but it wasn't what I was used to. While good, I think that they were a little bit small in size for the price. I may not get them again, but that night I was happy I did. 

Salad:
Cajun Cobb Salad: Romaine, Tasso Ham, Edamame, Cucumber, Radish, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Hard Boiled Egg, Tomatoes, House Made White Balsamic Vinaigrette. I wanted a salad but not a large one and the server suggested that I just get a side salad of any of the salads that they had on the menu. While smaller it was also just $3 less than the original price for the usual portion. If I knew that I would have just gotten the regular sized salad and brought some home with the dressing on the side. The cobb was good. Nothing out of the ordinary or outstanding. A solid salad for sure. 

Dinner:
Seafood Jambalaya: Cajun Rice, Chicken, Wild Caught Shrimp, Sea Scallops, Andouille Sausage. So the server asked if I liked spicy food. My answer was, sometimes. So he suggested that instead of the cajun rice I get the white rice. He said that the cajun rice had a lot of the spice in it and if I was not in the mood for a 6 on a scale of 1-10 then maybe to skip it. I took his advice and I think that next time I might ask for a mixture of the white and cajun rice. The dish was good but it lacked something, maybe the spice? It just needed a bit more to make it a real mouthwatering moment. The dish also came out so hot, its in a skillet, that it took a good bit of time to cool down. The shrimp was plump and juicy and the sea scallops were amazing. I was not the biggest fan of the shredded chicken, it tasted a little dry to me. It was a solid dish but I would hesitate to get it again. 

12oz New York Strip Steak. Loaded Mashed Potatoes, Sautéed Leeks, Wild Mushrooms, Demi-Glace. This really stole the show. I do not know how a steak could taste this good but boy, did it. I had more than a few bites of this steak and would have been ok if I too ordered it. My partner got the mashed potatoes but then substituted the leeks and mushrooms for peas and edamame. The mashed potatoes were amazing. They were just so good. And I cannot tell you enough good things about how well the steak was done and how juicy it was. YUM.

We took leftovers home for both of the dishes and ate for another day. It was a great time and it was even better with that $25 dollar off discount. AND!!! Nola is part of the Yelp Cash Back, so I was super surprised to see money in my account on Yelp! I totally forgot about that and it was a nice surprise. So come here with family and friends, sign up for their newsletter, and link the card you are going to use so you get cash back! Its really a great deal for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Whether or not NOLA is serving up bona fide Cajun/Creole cuisine is a non-issue to me. Whatever it is they're dishing out has successfully channeled the spirit of the late Justin Wilson, a colorful bard of a television chef who introduced me to Louisiana cookery when I was but a boy...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK4umRMJlrs

Before taking in a show at Heinz Hall, I decided on NOLA for my pre-event meal and was favorably taken aback by each and every dish I consumed. I was welcomed by a sociable staff and was seated promptly without a reservation. The patrons were a diverse bunch that ranged from middle-aged couples to teenaged skateboard anarchists, and the ambience was closer to time-honored than cutting edge; if a long-defunct, dimly-lit, and bygone Bourbon Street tavern was plucked from the timestream and into modern, urban Pittsburgh, you'd have an approximate rendition of NOLA. Jazz, conversation, and laughter nudged the air jovially, gently...

Finding it difficult to choose an entree, I was tempted by a threesome of appetizers, and in a fit of lunacy and foodlust, I ordered all of them.

The Crispy Fried Alligator comes to your plate in a bronzed mound of protein morsels artfully littered with chives and accompanied by a smear of spiced aioli. The dislimbed swamp dragon recalled lobster, scallops, catfish, and of course chicken with its meaty, juicy flavor and mouthfeel that was punctuated by the piquant orange cream. 

Barbequed Oysters on the half shell came next, and the slithering, slimy, slightly saliferous creatures were eviscerated swiftly by me, tart sauce, buttery cheese and all. The rocky chassis of each mollusk was left to creak in the dusk winds.

House Cured Pork Belly completed the trilogy. Candied and fabulously fatty, the protein portion of the dish was embrocated with a root beer-mustard glaze that wedded saccharine to brackish in eternal, Mephistophelian symbiosis. Fall squash puree, sliced Granny Smith apples, and cornbread arrived with the sour, the citrus, the juice, the crunch, and the grains in tow. Jalapenos were arrested on the spot for obnoxious loitering. How Mardi Gras. 

Looking over the dessert menu, I was once again came up against a dilemma, so I crazily doubled-up, tackling both the Red Velvet Ice Cream and the Bayou Chocolate Cake. 

Housemade, the scarlet ice cream had a sass that recalled cheesecake and was severely creamy, glacial, bewitching even...

The cake was nothing less than a devil...

A brooding, threefold chocolate cake, the sinister slab was desecrated by cocoa nibs, Guinness caramel, and Chicory Pudding, threatening to make me...

The occult danced with the sweet and briny around a mountain cemetery bonfire as crispy globes of decadent doom floated high above the muddy, funereal soil...

Exorcised with a glass of water, I thanked my hospitable waitress for her kindness and adept service, and left feeling renewed...

A meeting with comedic firebrand Lewis Black awaited me.

I may never make the pilgrimage to New Orleans, but I'll always have NOLA in my city, my heart, my stomach, and on my mind...

{"text":"I love Noa! I have been here for dinner twice and lunch twice. I love the menu and the cocktails. I am new to the area and this is the first place that I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the crab cake.  It was really well cooked and not too heavy. The waitress was really friendly and the atmosphere was pretty laid back for downtown lunch. It didn't take very long to get our food."}
{"text":"NOLA gets packed in the evenings and on weekends, but for good reason.  The bar is nice, the food is good, and the service is great.  Everyone that helped us was friendly and attentive, and made for an all around enjoyable experience.  I also never felt as though the restaurant was over-crowded, as some restaurants feel when there is a line out the door.  Also, Market Square is a great place to be on a nice afternoon in the Burgh too (or before a show at the theaters nearby).

The menu is more of a northern version of Cajun food than authentic, but there are some interesting appetizer and entree choices, both for the timid and the daring.  

My table ordered fried zucchini and alligator apps, and I had the quail for dinner, which was cooked perfectly.  The portions were very generous, and I was not able to finish my entire entree.  One of my friends had the scallop entree, and while it was a bit heavy and rich, it was also fantastic. 

Definitely worth a try if you have never been here before."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was average.  I went here with my mom who came to visit me on a whim.  We ate outside, which was nice.  Our waitress was very prompt.  They really try to give you a New Orleans feel here.  And I give them props for trying to do that in downtown Pittsburgh of all places.  But....the food was ok. There wasn't a whole lot of unique to it.  I mean, one of the specials was a New Orleans styled salad.  Salad.  As a Special.  It's just lettuce and some \"stuff\" in it right?  That's the special?  

Adding cajun fries was nice, but it's not what's bringing me back.  The French Onion soup was good, but salty.  The burger I had was very greasy.  The service, outside of the initial promptness was slooooooooow.  I think the waitress forgot to put in our order.  We waited a long time from order to delivery.  The people behind us didn't even get waters for the longest time, and they weren't that busy.  The watress apologized, but still got my mom's salad wrong, as she asked for no onions, but gave them anyways.  Either way, nothing here from preventing me from going back, but I'll probably check out the other restaurants in  Market Square first before going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. 5 star dining at its finest? Exclusive, authentic, gourmet cajun dishes combined with affordable prices makes NOLA a go-to get you southern fix. I've been here at least a dozen times and they have yet to disappoint.

A must-have every time we come is the fries alligator. Its surely the only place that I know of in the city the offers it, and every time is just like the first time. Today we stopped in for happy hour and we're delighted to find a handful of appetizer items for $4, small sides for $1 and half off flatbreads. Get the Peato Crawfish flatbread if you can. They also had house wines for $5 and beer and cocktail specials.

NOLA is a fun experience no matter what the occasion. Stop wasting time and get here now to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the seafood pot pie with no seafood , excellent for vegans. I also appreciated the lobster who waved at the seafood pot pie from a couple of meters before they closed the pie. I think I wrote a review 6 years ago but this was worthy writing a new one."}
{"text":"Place is awesome!  Chicken Andouille Po Boy is off the hook!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch; not speedy service but not slow either; it's a nice place so don't expect rush service. I read reviews about the service but I had no problem here. In any case, I had the gumbo ya-ya and gulf lump crab cake; both were terrific! Hope I get back to Pittsburgh to try some other items..."}
{"text":"Great food and good service but I think this place deserves three $ instead of two $ mains are priced from $20-39."}
{"text":"Visited twice, for lunch and dinner, and both meals were great.  Good portions, although the shrimp po' boy was a little heavy on the bread.  The bar was extremely loud, and we found it difficult to hear each other even when we were screaming from a foot away. Definitely recommend the red beans and rice though...and most noticeable was the great service!"}
{"text":"Wow this was easily among the most disappointing food experiences. My friends had brought me here for a birthday dinner and I was super excited because I love the Nola styles of cooking. The decor was lovely and our waitress was nice but that was all that was good. I ordered the Crawfsh Mac Daddy and for such a promising name the actual dish left so much to be desired. For starters, rather than a rich, creamy cheese sauce that coated the noodles and the seafood I received a thin, vaguely cheese flavored water that sloshed at the bottom of the cast iron dish. And rather than well seasoned seafood and tender vegetables, I got rubbery, nearly to the point of being inedible seafood that had no seasoning, much less anything that could even begin to bring to mind Creole or Cajun flavor, and raw vegetables. I didn't even finish it even though I was pretty hungry. There was hardly any flavor at all. For $26 dollars I expect actual seasoning and something that I, as someone who doesn't cook for a living, could not do better. I'm sad to say you'd  get more flavor at Popeyes."}
{"text":"Slightly contemporary and good food. I had the chicken and dumplings and blueberry bread pudding. I would highly recommend the bread pudding! The chicken was a little dry but the dumplings were made well. 

Live music at the location. Sitting outside is a little difficult if you are in a date or want to communicate. 

Casual or slight dressed up attire is needed for this venue. 

Bar tenders do a good job with the odd drinks and he drinks are very well made."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for work and a coworker recommended this place so we went here for a late dinner. I chose the seafood jambalaya. It was not so great. There was so much heavily seasoned sausage that it really muted out a lot of the other flavors I was enjoying. I ended up pushing several pieces of it to the side. I should say here that it's been my experience in this part of the US that restaurants seem to serve a lot of processed meats like sausage and cold cuts so if you're not used to that it can be overwhelming. 
The scallops were not fresh at all and poorly prepared. One was so fishy tasting that I couldn't eat it. I was really disappointed since I love scallops and this wasn't a cheap meal. 
Nice ambiance and the service was great but sadly I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try NOLA for a long time, and we finally made it for brunch last weekend. I think New Orleans has the most amazing food scene, and I was so excited that I might get to have some of that food-joy here in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, we just weren't very impressed.

My husband and father-in-law had the chicken and waffles. It's soooo much chicken--like a huge portion--although it was not specially seasoned which we kinda expected it to be. It was just really good fried chicken. The waffle was good, but not incredible.

My mom had the shrimp dish; I had the crab and asparagus omelet. We both liked our food, but again, we weren't blown away. My daughter liked the french toast although it was a little dry. It comes with a marmalade and a little light sauce, but maybe it needed something a little more liquid-y?

The highlight of my meal was the grits. The GRITS are GREAT although in my opinion, Carmi still has the best grits in town.

I tried one voodoo fry (not gluten-free), and it was good. I'd have more if I could, but I wouldn't go back just to have them.

The service was uneven. The assistant manager greeted us and brought us to our table. She was very nice. Our server was nice, but sometimes it was difficult to get his attention and he kept forgetting things, and as soon as he got another table, he disappeared. I don't think he was a bad waiter, but he wasn't very quick.

Bottom line: Not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"Stopped in before heading over to PPG place to ice skate. Kassandra was our bartender, she was awesome!! She helped my picky self choose  something great to drink. She had a lot of recommendations and was super friendly, efficient and attentive.  The French onion soup is by far the best I have ever had! My boyfriend had the shrimp fried sandwich and he really liked it as well. The other guy bartenders didn't really seem to care about us considering they came after we have been eating and they just seemed to care about talking about their personal lives right in front of us, must not have cared because they probably weren't getting apart of the tip, besides that everything was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"I must say, the Nola salad is absolutely delicious and if you do go, you should definitely give it a try. I ordered it with no tomato and dressing on the side. And as far as restaurant salads go it is relatively healthy. However, we went at lunch time, 12 PM on a Tuesday. They were by no definition busy. All we ordered was salads and half sandwiches and we were waiting for our food for about 45 minutes. I would not return for this reason alone. Not exactly what you're looking for when you just want a quick bite on your lunch break."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a fan of Seviche and the Sonoma Grille, so I had fairly high expectations walking in to the newly renovated NOLA...and I wasn't disappointed.

I have nothing but good things to say! The band was outstanding - sort of a Cherry Poppin' Daddies, jazz rock, kind of vibe. Our waitress was great and the food was excellent - the service was immediate and fast. We only had appetizers but I was impressed by the freshness of the fried green tomatoes, the perfect grill on the in-house sausage, and lack of grease with the hush puppies. 

Overall, I absolutely intend to go back for a full meal; and, expect this to become a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this restaurant is great!  Its in Market Square, they have outside dining so I really love to come here in the summer.  Its nice to sit outside and eat and watch all thats going on in the square!  They usually have a band playing there in the evenings which is nice.  The service was pretty good, and we didn't have to wait to long for our food.  Oh and I forgot to mention we were there on a friday so we did have a half hour wait , but it went fast because you can walk around the square, or sit at one of the tables in the square and watch all the people, so it was entertaining."}
{"text":"Great food but overpriced.  Food is good and lunch prices are OK.  Oyster po-boy and jambalaya were very good, although the po-boy has way too much bread."}
{"text":"We went in for a late Saturday lunch.  We had a reservation, not knowing if it as really necessary.  On this particular Saturday, it was not.  We were greeted right away by the host.  We were surprised when he gave us a \"tour\" of the restaurant showing us the rooms in the back for large groups.  We must look like party organizing people.  We are not.  We were seated near the open kitchen.  

Being a huge fan of red beans and rice, we decided to share a bowl.  Their version is totally unlike any I have ever eaten.  It was incredibly thick and tomato based with a lot of ham shank.  We liked it anyway.  For my meal, I ordered the half salad/half sandwich.  I got the NOLA salad with candied pecans, red onion, tomato and sweet potato chips with yummy vinaigrette.  For my sandwich, I picked the Croque Monsieur.  It was stuffed with tender, thick carved slices of smoked ham, grilled rustic bread, my favorite Gruyere cheese with apple butter and dijon.  Even though this was 1/2 sandwich, it was more than I could eat!!  BJ got the Seafood Jambalaya.  He really liked it.  Of course, we didn't have room for dessert. 

Enjoyed the atmosphere, food was great, service was passable.  We can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I liked the food, but it was nothing too memorable. I do however remember being turned off by the service. I don't think I've ever had a hostess be so rude to me in my life. I'm a pretty relaxed person, and totally understand that the food service industry can be stressful....but when it's a Monday night and not crowded, the hostess rolls her eyes at you, doesn't say hello, and just grabs menus, I'm going to be a little bit upset."}
{"text":"Great downtown restaurant. The ambiance is intimate and cool, and their menu is definitely different and refreshing from typical Pittsburgh dining that can get stale. Nice wine list, creative menu. However, not much for vegetarians--maybe 3-4 salads/entrees/appetizers that I could actually have. But the vegetarian dishes available all sounded delicious, so I didn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Has gone wayyyy down hill! I've eaten here about 10 times and each time I've enjoyed it less and less, however last night was my last night eating there. 

From the poor wait staff, to the over cooked porkchop and sad jambalaya, ending with a 35 minute dessert delivery and silverware washtubs being carried through the dining room I've had enough. 

I came into work today and told everyone about how awful is was and how upset I was just to hear they had the same experience a few weeks ago. 


The service- I've had good people before however this girl was slow, didn't know the menu, left all of the wine glasses on the table even though I was drinking a martini and the others beers. She didn't check on our table so I had to get up and request a manager to address the over done pork chop. (ordered medium came wayyyy past well- replacement chop was great) 

The Jambalaya- just a cheap version of something that used to be amazing. Made with no attention to detail, so much chicken and not enough seafood and andouille. This dish used to be two small chicken wings now they use huge grilled tenders and cut down on the actual meat you're interested in. Something else about the way it tasted was just off-- I feel like they are just cutting corners. 

Those are my thoughts--Sorry NOLA but you lost your touch"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the crawfish flatbread. Service was attentive and prompt without being intrusive. Pricing very reasonable considering the huge portions."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I had high expectations based on reviews I had read, but I was a little disappointed in the food. 

We had the seafood jambalaya which wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It had a very... interesting flavor (for lack of a better word). I'm not an expert at jambalaya but it didn't taste like what I remember. It had a bit of a sour taste to it which I decided I didn't like because it reminded me of food that was spoiling. 

We also had the Gumbo Ya-ya, and Creole Pulled Pork Po Boy. The gumbo was pretty good. As for the Creole Pulled Pork Po Boy, the pork  was pretty bland but it tasted good when eaten with the gumbo. It was served on fresh bread. 

The restaurant itself was pretty loud. Our waitress was really friendly and nice and the bathrooms were clean which is always a  bonus. Overall, I only gave NOLA a 3 star because I really did NOT like the way the jambalaya tasted. I had higher expectations for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  Had a fun jazz band Friday night came back saturday to eat.   Had Voodoo pasta with blacked catfish tryed 2 specialty drinks. Both yummy."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I ended up here since Meat & Potatoes was booked till 11pm. The entrance looks small but its a lot bigger inside so it's a great place for groups. I was very excited to try this place from what I heard from friends but I was underwhelmed by the food I had. Although the catfish was cooked well it wasn't as flavorful as the name of the dish. It didn't have any kick to it for something described as cajun. I was able to try the grits too and thought it was bland. The aligator bites were good though, very tender. I've never had alligator and it tasted just like calamari! I unfortunately didn't get to try the gumbo that Yelpers rave about.

They had a very enticing menu of special cocktails and I ended up ordering the Bayou royal tea. It was described as having lavender and honey but I couldn't really taste the lavender. It was pretty pricey too imo."}
{"text":"I have been to NOLA two times both around lunch time and both times we had amazing experiences.  We had flatbreads to start.  They are SO yummy!  I had the shrimp and grits both times we were there.  They are SO good I actually crave them!  I am not one for spicy in food but they add just the right amount of heat to them.  The Beneigts were just amazing!  We had terrific service!  We will DEFINITLEY return for the shrimp and grits!  Oh, and the atmosphere is sublime!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend on a Friday for dinner and drinks. They had a live blues band playing at the time. We sat toward the front of the restaurant to be near, and it was super loud. Of course we didn't complain since we wanted to sit there, but others further back did. 

Unfortunately, the quality of the food and drinks were bad. We ordered fried green tomatoes, frog legs, brisket sliders (on special), and crawfish flatbread. The tomatoes came out first, well before anything else - they were very bland. So about 20-25 minutes later the other appetizers came out with an additional plate of tasteless tomatoes. They advised the additional plate was on the house for the wait. Now for the frog legs... They were prepared differently than describes on the menu. Instead of being breaded, they came out in a broth... This was also very bland. The crawfish flatbread was soggy/slimy, but the brisket sliders were okay. They were dry, but the only decent item that we had. For a Cajun/Creole restaurant, the food was disappointing. The drinks were also very disappointing. We were going to order actual entrees, but given the quality that night - we opted out of that. 

At least the service was good. The waitress brought us everything we asked for, and came to check on us often.

The last time I was at Nola the food was very good, but that was a couple years ago. Not sure what happened, but I won't be visiting Nola again any time soon..."}
{"text":"It was very good food and I can't believe it's taken me this long to come out here and try it.  I loved the atmosphere and our waiter was attentive and helpful.  We went with a large group which sometimes means dinner can take a long time, but I didn't feel like we were a struggle for the restaurant.  
A bunch of us tried the fried alligator which was very delicious.  I'm a huge fan of duck and pretty much get it anywhere we go, and NOLA was no exception.  It was cooked well and they even made the swiss chard taste good.  I ate everything.  The sweet potatoes were legendary.  I would love to figure out how to make my own version of these.  To finish we all ordered beignets with ice cream or sorbet and they were delicious.  
We definitely left with a hefty bill, but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a very pleasant experience on a Friday night at NOLA.  I normally don't like loud dining venues, but in this case, I loved it! The live band was awesome...I was getting excited to hear what song they would play next.  The food was also really good.  I had the Brie and leek pasta because it isn't a very common dish to see served at restaurants, and although it was certainly a large enough portion, I found myself wanting more of it!  I also ordered several drinks and appetizers and was very pleased with all of them.  Our waiter was great, but I felt bad for him because he practically had to yell all night over the band to his customers.  I would definitely go back for dinner again!"}
{"text":"Been to NOLA several times.  The food is great!  Service always excellent.  Trendy spot.  Don't forget the beignets and alligator.  We came for drinks.. Thumbs up on the hurricane. ."}
{"text":"I had the quail and it was great. I thought the atmosphere was nice and since I did set at the bar I had a BB game to watch. 

The only thing negative that I can see with this pkace is the beer was too expensive. 

The food is a little pricey but it was good."}
{"text":"We had tickets to go to the Pirates game on this Sunday afternoon.  So we made brunch reservations to Nola so we could have a few drinks and some good food before we walked over to the baseball game.  
     
     We weren't sure if it was going to be busy or not so we made reservations just to be safe.  They opened at 11am and our reservations were at 1115.  We were the first customers to arrive that morning but I'm still glad that we made reservations.  Soon after this it did start to get busy.  

     We were greeted right away and taken to our seats.  Our waitress was training somebody so we have to girls waiting on us.  I felt a little rushed with our drink orders and looking at the menu.  They gave us a minute to look it over and came right back.  This is usually fine but we really needed a few more minutes.  We both ordered Beermosas!   We used Miller lite and mixed it with our orange juices.  It was a good combination for the morning and a perfect drink right before afternoon baseball.

     My wife ended up ordering the Eggs Trivette.  She said it did sort of remind her of an eggs benedict.  She liked it.  I really wasn't hungry for breakfast food right then so I ordered their Nola Burger.  That really hit the spot for me.  It's a big burger with cheese, cornmeal fried green tomatoes, and onion marmalade.  It was juicy and delicious!  My hamburger came with their Voodoo fries.  They were seasoned very well and I enjoyed the fries.  This early lunch was really good and it was the perfect combination right before the Pirate game.

     Overall we did have a good brunch.  I wasn't that big of a fan over their brunch menu but my wife did like hers.  The lunch and dinner menus are probably more for me which is why I really enjoyed my burger."}
{"text":"Brunch was meh - their \"brunch jambalaya\" is a heavy portion of cubed potatoes mixed with tomato sauce, 4 slices of andouille sausage,  2 shrimp and a very runny sunny side up egg. Photographs well but is not a good dish.  I should've known when our waiter in training (who greeted us with \"how are y'all doing tonight\" on Easter Sunday morning) said it was his favorite....  hubby liked his fried alligator po boy (but commented that bc it was so breaded he couldn't taste the alligator (which to me may have been a good thing?), and girls were satisfied with their french toast and vegetable cheese omelet.  The fruit that accompanied it was standard cut up melon and pineapple and grapes, like what you might get at a hotel's free breakfast buffet (aka institutionally packaged). Beignets were lukewarm and underwhelming, as was my coffee.  I chose this place at the last minute from a short list of available open brunch places for Easter... so I was grateful they were open but bottom line disappointed in the food and wouldn't recommend it.  Positives- reasonable prices, big space, and lots of tables."}
{"text":"I love New Orleans, so when I heard about this place I was super excited to try it out. I was hoping that they would have some et touffee (spelling?) but they don't. Sad face. Anyways, my disappointment quickly disappeared after I tried the shrimp and grits. I would recommend it to a friend and even a best friend. My girlfriend  had the pork dish and it was amazing. Get the beignets for dessert!"}
{"text":"Started out with the Royal Street Blues Martini and delicious fried green tomatoes. 

For dinner I enjoyed the blackened salmon over crawfish etoufee. Seasoned and cooked to perfection.

The weather was unseasonably warm so I sat on the patio.

Excellent service from the entire staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight with my friend and sister for drinks during happy hour. The drinks were large and mixed perfectly. We ordered the pierogis, stuffed mushrooms and margarita pizza. All of of them were really good! Our server was very attentive. It was a very good time. Definitely somewhere I would return to check out dinner service!"}
{"text":"to people who had problems with their service if you go in their slow times you will see great awesome service! I got french onion soup it wasn't probably traditional but really good. Soup, felt like it took hours. Also, the shrimp were cooked perfectly on the poboy it was very flavorful every bite till the end! shrimp were huge too, and the crunchy breading stayed attached. glad I kinda wimped out on alligator it made me a really happy camper. I know I and other people sometimes substitute on the entree or if you wana call a meal; please dnt take anything off here.  today sorta felt like royalty. but, it's probably more southern than cajun. it is worth trip and money."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Atmosphere is perfect!  My husband ordered French Onion soup and Jumbalia, I ordered the roasted vegetable salad and grilled chicken and dumplings.  We were not disappointed!  They brought my husband's soup and forgot my salad, when the waitress realized, she went to the kitchen (pretty cool, you can watch them cook!) and got on it!  She brought it out and apologized.  I told her it was ok, everyone makes mistakes.  About 2 minutes later the manager came over and apologized and took the salad off of my bill!  I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"NOLA is always on my list of go-to's for Market Square restaurants. I have had dinner and lunch here are various times and have always had an excellent meal. 

My latest foray to NOLA was for drinks before a late dinner. So let's move on... 

Atmosphere: Love the atmosphere at NOLA, it's why I continue to come back! I've been to New Orleans and it definitely takes me back. It has all the pomp and circumstance that I expect of the Big Easy. The one downfall was when I was visiting they had a jazz musician singing and while the music was fantastic, it was so loud I couldn't hear or talk to my date unless we were screaming at each other. 

Service: Our bartender was fantastic! He chatted us up and answered questions we had about the drink menu. Made and muddled my drink in front of us. The drawbacks were the one drink is actually hard to drink bc there is so much stuff muddled into it, and then when I ordered wine they were out of wine glasses for a solid 30 minutes. For a busy downtown bar / restaurant, how do you run out of wine glasses?! Needless to say, neither ruined my experiences with our night, just minor inconveniences. 

Drinks: Solid beer draft choice. Drink list was very interesting, but like I said above, it was hard to drink one of their cocktails because there was so much in it. Wine list was solid. 

All in all, I'm always going to make NOLA a stop."}
{"text":"Step into Nola and suddenly you're transported directly to New Orleans. The decor here is so charming and inspired entirely by the city. The color scheme is all purples and greens, and there are many historic touches such as a beautifully detailed ceiling. You almost forget that you're still in Pittsburgh!

The staff here is fantastic. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our waiter who was very personable and talkative with us. He even gave us pointers for some of his other favorite restaurants in the city that we should try out.

We started with the red beans and rice as an appetizer, which were so packed full of flavor I couldn't even believe it! You won't find a bland dish on the menu here. I had the shrimp and grits for my entree, and they were the best shrimp and grits I have ever had. The presentation was stunning (see the photo below), and I talked my boyfriend's ear off about how delicious it was for basically the entire time I was eating it. For dessert we shared this phenomenal chocolate and caramel cake that was also expertly decorated. I highly recommend the food here. It is on the more pricey side, but in my opinion is absolutely worth the price. This is a great place for a date night or special occasion. I have always wanted to travel to New Orleans and have never been able to, so I'm thrilled that I have such a delicious and authentic creole restaurant right here in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I'll try NOLA again, but I have to say my first experience was less than stellar.

We had a reservation but sat for 45 minutes at the bar waiting for them to get us a table.  I went up to them about 30 minutes in to see if they had forgotten us and got a confused look and finally a yes, we have you on the list.   They never seated us and never came around to offer alternatives or anything.  There were open tables.  Finally, we left and ate elsewhere.

Beyond the service, there was loud music--too loud to talk--blaring in the dining area.  I like music.  I like restaurants.  I don't mind when restaurants have music.  But when you cannot hear what the person you are eating with is saying to you and the bartenders cannot hear what you are ordering, the music is too loud for a restaurant.  I go to restaurants to enjoy a good meal and have a nice conversation with whomever I'm with.  I would guess most people share that belief.  If I want it that loud, I'll go to a bar, not a restaurant.  

Oh, and the beer from the taps tasted funky.  They either aren't cleaning their taps or are cleaning them improperly.  I tasted both an IPA and a wheat beer.  Both were weird.

Sorry, NOLA, but nothanks."}
{"text":"I hate to seem like a pretentious snob, but I wouldn't say the food is really all that authentic \"Cajun\" or \"Creole\". Been to NO many a time, and I know what authentic Cajun food tastes like. The food was okay, but I've had better.

Even so, I'd still rate this place fairly high. As I said, authenticity issues aside, the food is okay. The service was definitely over par, so if you're not hung up on the fact that it's not quite what you'd get in the French Quarter, then go there and you'll probably have a good dining experience. The decor and ambiance are definitely high on the cool meter. I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! We were visiting over the weekend and stumbled upon this place. We read the previous reviews and were iffy about it but tried it out because they were really the only places that had a full bar and was open during the time (got there around 10:45) they accommodated us very well and our server, Emma, was more then willing to go out of her way and explain the menu for us."}
{"text":"Delicious Lunch! Decided to head to NOLA for a Monday Afternoon Lunch! Nice Creole New Orleans menu options. I got the Brassiere Steak Salad and it was delicious. Even though there were a fair amount of fries, the salad was still a healthier option from their menu. Steak was cooked perfectly as ordered Medium. Waitress / bartender was very nice, got my order and my coworker's order correctly ordered! I'm sure I will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"NOLA is a can't-miss for all you adventurous diners. There are definitely some unique options on the menu. I was skeptical, but any restaurant that offers a vegetarian/vegan menu earns some brownie points automatically. The decor exudes an upbeat, jazzy atmosphere to complement their New Orleans vibe. I'm a sucker for unique restaurant themes, no matter how corny. 

They provide lunch specials where you can mix and match soup, salad, and sandwiches, but unfortunately, the vegetarian selections are not included in this deal. I ordered the Spinach Summer Salad to start and it was delicious. Fresh and fruity with a nice crunch from the almonds. After cleaning off the salad, it was time for the Vegan Rice Creole. Amazing!! It's essentially rice mixed with a tomato salsa topped with carrots and peas. I know it sounds a bit off, but trust me, it's phenomenal. The portion is also big enough for a second meal which is always a plus. 

Oh, by the way, the voodoo fries are a must! I'm not sure what dark magic they use to season the fries, but I couldn't stop eating them until every last one was gone. Insanely addicting!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night and I have to tell you it was fantastic. The alligator and pork shank to start was awesome. We shared the quail, jumbolia, scallop Mac and cheese, and shrimp and grits. Everything was awesome from the food to the service to the plating. 
 Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will be coming back"}
{"text":"I've not been to NOLA since they first opened and I loved it then. But what was I thinking waiting so long to get back?? Seriously I know we're becoming a foodie city and have so many choices but this restaurant is a staple; New Orleans style. The decor is a chic take on the French Quarter with a superior wait staff and quality management style. The food is simply fantastic. Fried green tomatoes sprinkled with shredded white cheddar and drizzled in a hearty ranch mayo. The grilled chicken and dumplings---scrumptious! Ricotta dumplings with peas, wild mushrooms and carrots in a flavorful sauce. Chicken is grilled with fragrant spices that bring Bourbon Street to mind. If you're like me and not been in forever or have never been, you need to get there to enjoy what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Amazing well stocked bar. Try to go during a jazz night if you can for the full experience!  Try the pork tenderloin! I don't know what's in that purée but it is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant so many times that I had to give it a try! 

NOLA was pretty good! I had the jambalaya and it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. It was spicy but that's the only flavor I could taste. 

The service was a little flakey at times and we had to wait a while for our food. They were very accommodating and even gave us a bread bowl because we were so hungry. 

If you love New Orleans cuisine with a Pittsburgh Twist, give NOLA a try!"}
{"text":"We started off with the crab bisque. I ordered the jumbalaya and my wife went with the  shrimp & grits. Both dishes were excellent. We finished off the meal with creme brûlée. Excellent food, excellent drinks, excellent service. Top drawer experience."}
{"text":"Yay for new restaurants!  Yay for fun new restuarants!  And a final yay for a good exerpeince at a fun, new restaurant!

I always love walking into a restaurant which looks super duper tiny from the front and then surprises you by being large on the inside.  The colorful pictures and art make it a bright and fun atmosphere.  Just like you'd expect from a 24/7 Mardi Gras party, minus maybe the flashing!

First time's a charm with this place!  Service was fantastic!  The server came up and explained everything to us in terms of drinks, apps and main courses.  Since it was for lunch I went on the light side with the Crawfish and Sherry soup and the Nola salad.  

The soup was delicious with just the right amount of kick for me.  Sometimes if things are too spicey for me I become a watery mess, and not in the emotional way!  I think the soup was just creamy amazingness!  

The salad was also very fresh with some great toppings such as candied pecans and my personal fav, little mini potato chips.  Of course the later mentioned doesn't end up making a salad healthy, but whatever, it was tasty!  For a final send off we ordered the fried artichoke's as our \"dessert.\"  They were incredible!  Nice, crispy and huge with a spicy mayo type sauce.  I'm all about the sauces, so it was just the right touch.

I really can't wait to try out this place for dinner and/or a happy hour!  I will definitely be back.  I hope they have some idea's for events, because I think the place will be a great host for special parties.  Great addition to Market Square!!"}
{"text":"Really not good.  Shrimp and grits is really salty small overcooked shrimp soup with a square of dry tasteless grits.  Service was good as well as atmosphere.  Others in the party liked their food and some didn't.  Very inconsistent."}
{"text":"First, this should be 3 or 4 dollar signs.

Great food, but not for the money.  There should be more seafood in the seafood dishes.  We went with a group of seven.  The waiter kept giving us things that we didn't order - 2 dishes and a drink.  He left the things at the table and said I won't charge you for this, at which point we shared them or asked to have them packed up.  At the end, all of these mistakes showed up on the bill, inflating it by around $30.  He refunded one of the three items.  If they want to charge prices like they do, the service and customer satisfaction should be better.  

There were also a lot of other little mistakes.

A better server could have made this 4 stars.  Also, if I didn't dissuade you from going, try the Bagnettes (awesome powdered doughnuts.)  A very nice desert to share with 2 or 4."}
{"text":"Visited here with the family for a light dinner and live jazz. Had a great time. Theirs flat breads are delicious, nice fresh salads, good choice of drinks. But the main highlight is the atmosphere. Loved the jazz band performance (Benny Benack), had lots of fun."}
{"text":"Great location, music and fun decor/ambiance. The food was pretty good - our favorite was the side dish of jambalaya."}
{"text":"Had a delicious, quick lunch here. I ordered the summer spinach salad. It didn't look like it had any dressing on it and I was nervous I would feel like a koala bear eating it but it was perfectly dressed with a peach tea type vinaigrette . Everything in it was perfectly seasoned from the spicy almonds, goat cheese, and pickled tomatoes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here, but the atmosphere was quite loud, and I think geared a little bit more towards the younger, 'trendy' crowd.  There was a live band playing, and they were decent, but very loud to the point where it was pretty difficult to hear my date.  I got the salmon etoufee as my entree - I asked them to cook it medium rare, because so often I find that my dishes are slightly over cooked.  When it came out, it was definitely very rare - basically just quickly seared on both sides.  Now, I love raw salmon/sushi - so this actually didn't bother me as much as the average person, but both the seasoning and the sauce that it was in was very salty - and I love salty foods.  Though enjoyable, I don't think that this would be a destination for me, unless I happened to be in the downtable/Market Square area."}
{"text":"Service 4/5
Decor 4/5
Food 2/5

Nothing we ate had much creativity. The frog legs were okay, the salad, and Jambalaya were mediocre."}
{"text":"Interesting Cajun place midst a number of other restaurants in market square.  Interior was honestly pretty gaudy, I understand embracing the New Orleans feel but the sheer quantity of decorations was distracting.  Service was excellent, we were seated and served quickly.

Po' boy sandwiches were good, but dry.  Excellent fries and slaw with the meals.  Soups were among the better choices at our table, especially the oyster stew.  I was a little underwhelmed by spice usage in all of our dishes, I expected more of a punch.  Prices were reasonable considering the location, and the drink selection seemed fair enough.

Pretty tasty food, worth a try if you're hankering for some Cajun, but be cognisant of other options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I went for the first time for an early dinner around 4:30 PM on Sunday prior to going to see a show at Heinz Hall.  We opted to sit inside instead of outside to avoid the cigarette smoke coming from people smoking outside the restaurant but nearby to the outdoor seating.  My cousin has been here many times and loves it and we've traveled to New Orleans together around 20 times over the last 15 years so I was excited that she recommended it so highly.  The restaurant has a fairly extensive cocktail, beer, and wine list and my cousin ordered a beer but I ordered a glass of wine and felt that the pour was very small for the price.  For our appetizers and main courses, she ordered the gumbo and the BBQ shrimp (from the appetizer menu) and I ordered the Cajun chowder and was torn between the shrimp and grits and the scallops and shrimp mac daddy, but upon our servers recommendation and because I'm a sucker for shrimp and grits, I went with the shrimp and grits (which at least another reviewer mentioned that it is really overpriced at $27 - believe me, the quality of the grits and the amount of shrimp that you get for the $27 is far from worth the money).  My cousin tried my chowder and I tasted her gumbo and I found the flavors of both the be tasty though I felt that the gumbo was a little under-seasoned while the chowder was flavorful but overly salty.  Our main courses arrived and again we shared a taste of each other's dishes.  The BBQ shrimp was very flavorful but again overly salty and the shrimp and grits were a mixed bag in my opinion.  The sauce on top of the grits with the shrimp was the same as the sauce on the BBQ shrimp plus it had the addition of very salty bacon yet the grits on their own were rather bland and even mixing them together to mingle the flavors did not cut down on the excessive saltiness in the dish.  I am someone who actually prefers my food on the saltier side so the mere fact that I am actually complaining about how salty everything was means that it was quite over salted.  I could feel my ankles swelling as the meal came to a close.  We also shared the beignets for dessert.  The trio of sorbet that came with the beignets was delicious and refreshing and but the beignets were a little flat and dense compared to the beignets that I've had in New Orleans but tasty.  Overall I would go back but I would probably keep to the lower priced items because I feel that much of their menu is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Larkin Larkin Larkin... I cannot say enough about this server. She was not only knowledgable about EVERYTHING on the menu, but also incredibly sweet and efficient. Food was amazing but I will come back for the service."}
{"text":"NOLA on the square has nicely decorated the old interior of 1902 cafe.  I loved the open kitchen, and the beautiful artwork on the walls.  They serve up very tasty and almost authentic New Orleans Cuisine.  

I ordered the shrimp po'boy and it came with 5 huge fried shrimp served up on a soft Italian bread.   The breading was quite tasty but you could tell that the shrimp was not seasoned properly and was slightly overcooked.  The slaw that came on it was sweet too even though the description was Cajun Slaw, Spicy Papaya Ravigote.  I expected it to me spicy!  To my dismay they only had one type of hot sauce - Tabasco.  Come on my friend if you want to serve New Orleans cuisine you better serve food that is spicy and have a selection of hot sauces to choose from. My friend ordered a Croque Monsieur, which she really enjoyed because of the hand carved ham.  For dessert we shared a banana bread pudding with caramel ice cream.  The ice cream had a ridiculous amount of caramel in it, and was very overpowering.  The bread pudding was good on it's own.   

A few additional grips: it's slightly expensive for lunch (our bill was about $40 total with tip+tax for two people), and waitstaff is overattentive (i had about 4 people come towards me as I walked through the door to be seated, proceeded by our waitress who came back every minute, literally to ask if we were ready to order).....  Alas, I'd still come back for the food.

Tip: portions are huge so bring your appetite, or a partner to share!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Nola. We ordered the alligator appetizer, which was plenty for two to share and had a nice tasty sauce that came with it. I wasn't crazy about th appetizer but it wasn't too bad. I also got the chicken and dumplings for my meal for the first time and it was delicious. It was also very filling so I would definitely get this meal again! We were seated right away on a Saturday night and had no wait."}
{"text":"Another place that I enjoy but is presently closed but due to reopen soon. 
My fiance & I love love LOVE their Louisiana Cajun style food. ...SOO OOOO good.  Our favorite is the alligator tail meat appetizer that's fried & seasoned to absolute perfection.
They also have an excellent fully stocked bar & they have a nice cocktail list too.
Looking forward to when they open again, the live music is also awesome & gives the place a great atmosphere to kick back & enjoy."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, not too busy on a Wednesday afternoon around 2pm was seated right away. Out door seating available which was very nice. I had the steak salad and it was cooked to perfection and tasty. Pricing was reasonable 13.00 for a salad isn't bad with the lovely ambience. Would recommend with spot to anyone looking to have lunch with a friend or by yourself:)"}
{"text":"Friend is the manager so down here for lunch. I'd been hearing about this and was treated pretty well since I was with the manager, but the server was not very good. My friend had to get up and get our own food, drinks, etc... The gumbo was just ok, the beer was great, and the desert was tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer and quick snack.

French onion soup was flavorful...salty, but very tasty! Will come back for it if I'm craving soup in this chilly weather.

Fried green tomatoes were excellent. First time having beer battered fried green tomatoes...usually see them crusted with bread crumbs or panko. Sauce and cheese topping were on point.

Nothing on the dinner menu caught my eye, but I would come back for sure!"}
