{"text":"4/5!

Chatime is finally in Mississauga!!! 

I went in the afternoon and it wasn't too busy, pretty good actually. My friend ordered two supersize roasted milk teas with taro and I ordered a hot taro milk tea (sick person here) and it was sooooo good. Tastes really creamy and rich so I'm actually still sipping on it. You get to choose your sugar level (110%, 100% normal, 80%, and so on) and if you wanna add anything (taro, peaches, etc). I got a regular and after tax it was $4.75. 

In terms of bubble tea quality in comparison to other chains, I like Chatime a bit more cause of their ingredients and their taste. Granted, I haven't tried the cold bubble tea from this location but I did in Toronto. Bubble republic is still pretty good but bubble tease is too watered down for me. 

Anyway, I would recommend hitting up Chatime when you can. Lots of combinations to choose from!"}
{"text":"I visited this location a few days ago and I was glad that my experience this time was much better.

First they accepted credit cards as well which much more convenient. 
I ordered their banana milk tea with tapioca and it was delicious. 

I'm glad I gave this location another shot!"}
{"text":"Amazing variety and excellent quality bubble tea. The place is always busy with customers in the evenings but service is still fast. I am a fan of Taro milk tea; wherever I go that would be my order. But there, I have to say I was surprised by how good the other tea options were.

What I like most is the fact that you can ask for less sugar and you get it. Less ice and you get what you want. Unlike many other places who would fill in on ice and increase sugar to decrease their costs."}
{"text":"Sad to say I didn't love Chatime =( Maybe it was just this location and I will have to give others a try. I have been 3 times and ordered a bubble tea each time. Overall the taste is fine, but nothing special. The also charge to have 1/2 jelly, 1/2 tapioca - which in my past experience has always been free. Location is nice, convenient. I like the modern decoration. Unfortunately I found the service to be bad on all three of my visits. In general the cashiers always seem to be rude. Also it tends to take a long time for the drinks to be made because the staff tend to be chatting. Likely will not go back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Chatime regularly for the past year and a half. 

If you're looking to get bubble tea real quick, don't even THINK about coming here on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. During the day, the place is usually empty but when students start coming out of class and employees are out of work, they seem to all synchronize watches and come later during the night. They also come in groups so expect the venue to be really loud. For a small space, it's not ideal, but whatever feeds that bubble tea craving. 

I've never had a problem with the staff. They have never gotten any of my drinks wrong, nothing like that. They tend to take longer whenever I order a slush, but that's a given. I'm not really one to notice if service is slow, so maybe that's why I don't notice how long they take.

Overall, if you don't mind crazy lineups and pretty good customer service, Chatime is great."}
{"text":"I think it's doing fairly well as a new business in Mississauga. I have to admit that I am unhappy with the service, and wait time but I'll still suck it up and go (at an appropriate time). Hopefully the hype dies soon and people get better with ordering!! 

Like I'm not going to go on a friday night when it's jammed pack and complain about how it was sooooo long.  It is when its mid afternoon and I have to wait 15 mins in line for like 3 people in front of me. Then wait another 20 mins for my drinks. The staff do apologize for the wait but maybe it's not enough =s

I do enjoy my choices :) However! It must be complicated for other guests because it takes forever for people to decide and holds up the line.  O_o

Here's how to order
1. Pick a drink
2. Want a topping? pick
3. ice level (none, less, normal or more)
4. sugar level (0, 30, 50, 80, 100 normal)


The service is okay considering it's new. The only thing that annoys me that the cashier will greet and ask what I would like to order, but then turns around to joke around with another employee. Dear cashier lady, please don't acknowledge me if you aren't ready to listen and will get my drink wrong. 


PS. two large grass jelly roasted milk teas will cost $10.62 after tax :) without tip


Looking forward to adding more reviews stars.... maybeeeeee!"}
{"text":"My favourite bubble tea place!

Drinks: I've been such a long time Chatime fan I think I've tried almost their whole menu already. My favourites are the basic #1 on their menu, chatime pearl milk tea, and mango slush! You can always ask for less or more sugar or ice or tapioca/jelly. Their drinks without asking for anything altered are already perfect enough! My least favourite though would have to be the honeydew. I usually really love honeydew bubble tea but for some reason, it's my least favourite at Chatime. It still tastes good, just not my favourite. I think it's because I can barely taste the honeydew. Or maybe it was just a bad day for the worker. 

Customer Service: Always the best! They remember their regulars! It's always nice for the employees to remember my drinks and confirm it with me before I order. Most of them are always smiling and are really easy to talk to. 

Overall: Will always love it here specifically. I've tried other Chatime places like on Yonge, Markham, Vaughan, but I guess my favourites here on Bloor. Maybe it's because I'm so comfortable with the employees? 4/5. I know that it's my favourite place but that 1 missing star goes to the price. I understand that these shops should be expensive but it's just a little bit too much for me. When I'm trying to save money but want some bubble tea, I'd have to stop myself from going to Chatime and go to Coco instead because theyre maybe about a dollar cheaper T_T"}
{"text":"I feel so ripped off right now!!!  Long queue, poor service, paid $5.40 for basically pure milk and some tapioca balls.  

Told the cashier that it was my first time here and I read good things on Yelp about Chatime.  She kind of looked at me funny didn't bother to engage with me at all, just asked what I wanted.  Large milky green tea with tapioca balls, 80% sugar and less ice.  What I got is the most watered down bubble tea I've ever had."}
{"text":"Worst cha time drink ever. 

Got here around 4pm on Saturday and waited 20 minutes for my drink. Ordered brown sugar roasted milk tea with grass jelly. Full sugar and no ice. This must be the worst drink I have had in my life. Tastes super bitter like oversteep tea. I think they forgot to put in the syrup too. 

I wanted to go back for an exchange but I ended up throwing the drink away."}
{"text":"I got the strawberry bubble tea but was originally going to get the banana one but they said that they didn't have it in stock, so I settled for the strawberry. The bubble tea was okay-tasting, didn't wow me or anything. the one thing that kind of threw me off was how expensive it was, I got the smallest size and it was $5. So I think if I wanted to go get bubble tea again, I would go to the nearby btrust or TNT and get it there for cheaper."}
{"text":"I like this spot because it's not too crowded, it's very spacious and open and clean, and I had a great study session upstairs. Hanging out in this place is perfect for a rainy, overcast type of day.

They should have some reusable cups instead of only having the plastic 1-time-use for the waste-conscious folks."}
{"text":"Ever since I tried Chatime's Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea at their downtown location, I've been wishing one would open up in Mississauga. That day has come!

Compared to their downtown location, Chatime Mississauga seems to be be a little bigger, but it looks quite similar in terms of the store layout and decor. 

At 8 PM, during their BOGO promo, the line was out the door. I waited 30 minutes, which is actually the same amount of time I have had to wait at their downtown location during a weekday lunch or after-work hour. That's how popular Chatime is! 

Despite the extensive menu, the Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea is my go-to drink. I love grass jelly, and surprisingly, it goes really well with their roasted milk tea. Chatime gives you the option to choose the amount of sugar and ice you prefer (which is great!), and I typically ask for 80% sugar and less ice.

It's nice to have another bubble teashop in Mississauga, and it's great that the new bubble teashop in town is Chatime. :)"}
{"text":"I always come here for a drink, a little cheaper that Bubble Republic, although BR is much better quality. Chatime uses milk thats why the drink is so pale. As to BR, they uses evaporated milk, much richer and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Nice Mango Green Tea and Taro Milk Tea, I love the taste of the sticky taro."}
{"text":"We go at least once a week-- thank you rewards card, it's wonderful to get a free drink with every 10 purchases! Indeed it's an extremely busy location especially on weekends and I agree with other posts that a second cashier would be helpful to move the line along. It seems though they are trying to hire more help as every time we go in the help wanted sign is still up.

The disappointment with this place and why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is they often run out of tapioca, or pudding, or a certain drink! If the owner is already aware that weekends are busy and they are constantly running out of ingredients, shouldn't the owner be prepared and order well in advance?  They have lost business from us when they've run out of tapioca."}
{"text":"Chatime is fantastic! Not only are their drinks amazing but their service is superior. I ordered a Lychee Milk Tea, however, I didn't enjoy it. I went back to the cafe and I asked for a new one. They took my old drink and made me a Green Tea Milk with no problems or questions asked. They were happy to serve me and I always feel welcome when I'm there. Chatime is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Yay! My friend told me about chatime's grand opening on Friday so I just had to go. This new location is nice, clean and friendly. 

I ordered the Chatime Roasted Milk Tea with coconut jelly, no ice and regular sugar. It was the perfect amount of sweetness for me and I will definitely come back. I used to go to the downtown location but it was too far. Thank goodness that they opened one in Mississauga. The pricing is reasonable, roughly $5.30 for a large drink. They also have free Wi-Fi unlike other Bubble tea places. 

I used to go to Bubble Republic for Bubble tea but recently,  they changed their menus, increased the prices, and downgraded their food and drinks. Now that chatime's opened, I probably won't be visiting br for a while.

All I can say is great bubble tea! Only thing stopping from giving it 5 stars is their Service. Maybe because they're just starting out but, their Service is slow. I went again today and waited in line for around 10 mins, ordered then waited for another 20 mins or so to get my drink."}
{"text":"Love this location since it's not too busy and there are places to sit and do work! The bubble tea is always delicious at Chatime and this place is no exception. The tapioca is very fresh and was sweet and chewy; just how I like it.

Note: their drinks with regular sugar are very sweet, probably to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. I generally like sweet drinks, but it was still way too sweet for me. I went with half sugar, and since the tapioca is already sweet, it was perfect.

Also, I highly recommend trying red bean as a topping if you want to try something new. I tried it for the first time here and I LOVED it. A new favourite.

The only thing that kind of bothered me during 1 visit here was how one of the workers behind the counter was yelling really loud for some reason, and was dropping the f-bomb multiple times in a screechy voice. I understand that she may have been frustrated about something, but to disturb the entire store like that was a little unprofessional.

Aside from that, I still really love this location. The workers are all very friendly and the atmosphere is generally very relaxing."}
{"text":"Yikes! Bubble tea quality not half as good as the one on Dundas. No wonder it was so empty (despite being a bit out of the way). I ended up throwing mine out after finishing less than half, and this is coming from a BBT fanatic."}
{"text":"I'm soo so soo glad that there is a cha time near me because I am a Chatime addict - but really this place has the slowest service ever. Never mind when it's a busy evening and their lines are out the door, even on the slowest and emptiest days (like 2pm on a Monday), they take forever to make the drink. It's incredible how long they take compared to any other bubble tea shop. It's a time investment to just drop by and pick up a drink on-the-go. It doesn't stop me from coming because I love their drinks but I was really hoping they can improve on the speed of their service. Please please find a way to make the drinks faster!"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place because of good reviews, but we were thoroughly disappointed! We called in for delivery and ordered four drinks in total. The lady on the phone said that if we ordered a fifth drink, the delivery fee would be waived, so we said why not, and ordered one more. She read back our order, and then said it would take about 20 to 30 minutes, so we waited.

AN HOUR LATER, the delivery boy shows up and hands us our drinks. They only take cash, so I asked him if he had change. He seemed really confused and didn't seem to understand me until I had said it five times. Finally he understood I needed change, but he still seemed really confused and just pulled random amounts out of his wallet, even though I told him repeatedly I needed 10. He finally handed me the correct amount, and I thanked him, and he walked away with the most perplexed look on his face.

First thing I noticed was that none of the drinks were labeled, so it was up to us to figure out the flavours from the colour, which was unfortunately all super similar. When we sorted out the drinks, we began to realize that they had messed up our order-- they had mixed up some of the drinks! Kind of irritating since we waited so long for our orders. We decided to drink them anyway, but we discovered that the pearls were incredibly undercooked... not fun biting into something gelatinous on the outside and hard and chalky on the inside!

To make this all better, I checked the receipt and realized that they had charged us delivery anyways!! I called them, and asked them about the drinks and delivery charge, and their response was just that they were busy and five drinks was a lot so of course mistakes happen. I don't know, this was a little shady to me... Super unimpressed! :"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Their bubble tea is ok but I think Sharetea is better. The only reason I go there is because it's the closest to university. When think about their staffs, it makes me hesitate to walk in. Since others have also been complaining about this, the managers should already start taking it serious."}
{"text":"Bought 7 items in total but they missed one of them which I already paid for it. Then I have called 4 times to the store but no one answered the phone once. Maybe they have toy phone instead of a real one."}
{"text":"Our go-to boba tea place in Mississauga and in fact in the GTA since they have so many locations.  Sometimes when the line up is long at Mississauga we will go to bamboo bubble tea or if we feel like something more fruity we go to real fruit but when it's milk tea, Chatime is it ... We usually get taro, milk tea, roasted milk tea or strawberry milk. Once i got some plum flavour but it tasted so bad to me - not what I was expecting and they let me change it so great customer service!  Apparently it's not like North American plum flavour - oops.  Anyways the boba is always nice and squishy and the flavours taste authentic. By that I compare to places like bubble republic which tastes too carnation-milky to me."}
{"text":"Although a bit pricier, this is one of the best bubble teas I've had in the city. You get what you pay for and you'll get an amazing bubble tea at this place. I recommend to take it to go. The actual restaurant is not very inviting to actually sit inside."}
{"text":"I always like trying new bubbletea places and when Chatime finally opened up in Mississauga, I knew I had to go and try them out. I was recommended their grass jelly roasted milk tea and I couldn't have been happier! That is my go to drink although I've been adventurous and tried other ones.

The only thing is service is still a bit slow. I've been to the one near the Annex and service was quite quick so I'm not sure why the Mississauga location is still slow when they've been open longer. 

Anyways I'll still visit the Mississauga location but I hope they make the drinks faster in the future."}
{"text":"Chatime has one of the best bubble teas in North America. I first had their bubble teas in Toronto and immediately loved it.

The good:
- Great tasting and authentic bubble teas. 
- Great variety of bubble teas. 
- Many ways of customizing your tea, such as choosing warm vs. cold, amount of ice, amount of sugar, etc.
- Reward card gives you a free tea after 9 purchases. 

The not-so-good:
- The store itself has few seats and is not well decorated or suited for sitting down and enjoying your tea. 
- Staff service is average at best. 
- Teas are on the pricier side (5-7$). 

Bottom line:
I highly recommend this place for bubble tea enthusiasts, although the products are slightly on the pricier side (5$+). Suggest you order to go as there isn't much space to sit and chat.

EDIT: Grammar and spelling."}
{"text":"There are a few times that you really find a spectacular place that makes bubble tea - going to Cha Time was one of them! I ordered a taro smoothie and it was the smoothest smoothie I have ever tasted; the fluid just rolled over my tongue as my taste buds were stimulated with the wide array of flavours between the taro and coconut jellies. My fiance and I went on a Friday night and the place was packed!! The front door was jammed open from snow and the inside was freezing but nobody seemed to care. The workers seemed knowledgeable and friendly. Cha time does not look like much from the outside, especially since it's beside a sketchy massage parlour, but once you are inside you feel like in a completely different world!"}
{"text":"Ive been to a couple different locations downtown. It seems very popular and Ive tried it a few times but it just tastes very mediocre to me. Ive tried at least the taro, steamed green tea latte and their #1 and theyre all just okay to bad. Theres a bubbletease across the street on dundas which is better, and ive tried gongcha up north which is amazing. Theres also a very solid cheap place near st patrick and dundas in that mall connected to ocad."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about Chatime finally coming to Mississauga, I decided to give it a try.  Per the other reviews, I tried the Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea, and I was pleasantly surprised with its unique texture and taste! Quite different from the average taro bubble tea at Ten Ren's, etc.  
The drinks here are never too sweet, so I don't really get sick of them easily.  Also, the prices are a little on the higher side, but I've never really had such unique bubble tea, so I guess it's worth it.  The place is also always busy, so I guess that says something about its consumer satisfaction.  Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Arrived 10 min after they had opened one day in -30 weather. We were not the first customers as there was someone there already. Upon walking in, three employees stood at the counter staring at us as if we had walked naked into their living room. So awkward. No greeting, no smile, all three just stared. 

Once we got settled we went back to the counter to order - they didn't have boba ready. At a boba shop. Needless to say, it was pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"\"SO IS IT TIME TO CHA... OR SOMETHING?\"

When this location first opened up, there was a lot of buzz around it. (At least around people that I know) I didn't really understand it because as far as I was concerned, bubble tea is bubble tea. And the last time I'd had some bbt was probably in high school or university. But in the spirit of open-mindedness, I gave it a shot. 

I've been here a total of three times and only on my most recent visit did I experience the long lines that other Yelpers have spoken of. This place is definitely very popular! Given that, the wait wasn't really that bad. We were there at around 9:30 in the evening and it only took about 15 minutes from the time we walked in to the time our drinks were ready. 

I like that they have a Top 10 list, it makes for trying new flavours a lot easier. Also helpful for weeding through all the different options available. Something I didn't notice until my most recent visit was that they also have desserts like donuts available too. Not really a big donut fan, but I wonder if they're any good?

I usually go with something generic like green apple or mango when I have bbt but I tried the roasted milk with grass jelly and it was pretty awesome. I think the quest to conquer the entire Top 10 would be enough to keep me coming back for at least a little bit."}
{"text":"So we went with a classic tea with bubbles with less ice and a passionfruit freeze with bubbles.  It took about 15 minutes as there were 3 couples ahead of me.   

They had cool Japanese magazines to look at while waiting so I didn't complain! 

Make sure you get what you ordered because my drink was missing bubbles and I had to show my receipt to prove it!  The passionfruit freeze should have been blended more as I ended up chewing ice cubes but the bubbles were perfectly chewy and abundant.   The tea I was told was a bit too warm so I guess no more \"less ice\" requests.   But it had a great tea taste to it and wasn't too sweet.  

I'll go again to try something else...maybe I haven't found \"my drink\" yet!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been looking for a good bubble tea restaurant and we have been to plenty places but none prevailed. I stumbled across this one since we were craving and Ilove it!!! I had the regular milk tea and he had the taro. For most of the vacation i was looking for a real fruit or authentic bubble tea place and the ones I have been to are only powder...yuck.

 I would highly recommend this place!! it has a cute cafe feel, but not many tables to sit at. It's mostly like a grab and go cafe. It's in downtown so parking is fairly hard to find. They have a website that has some of the choices as well."}
{"text":"Priced higher than the competitors and the quality isn't as good.  They have good marketing though.  Service was a little slower at this Chatime compared to the others I've gone to."}
{"text":"Love the original taiwanese style milk tea with tapioca. Great hot or cold. Usually order with half sugar to bring out more of the tea flavour. I have yet to find a milk tea that can beat this one in Toronto (Green Grotto might be a close 2nd)."}
{"text":"I love chatime and I love Thai iced tea. When I found out their spring flavours included Thai milk tea, I had to give it a try! Large ($5) with tapioca ($0.50). 

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be ordering the Thai milk tea again because it tasted watered down. I'm still a huge fan of their roasted milk teas and their grass jelly though so I'll probably stick to my go to order!

Also, this location is only a couple of blocks away from spadina station and is significantly larger than the yonge/dundas one so shorter lines!! It has an outdoor patio and is very spacious overall - plenty of seating inside. Great for groups! 

And I highly recommend ordering something from their top 10 favourites menu if it's your first visit, soooo good! As with all chatime locations, everything is customizable: ice levels, sweetness, hot or cold and your choice of toppings."}
{"text":"Price: 5/5 pretty good pricing here. Most drinks are 4.20 for a regular and 4.70 for a large. 

Atmosphere: 4/5 nice spot to hang out and catch up with friends. Not that many seats and is pretty crowded most nights. 

Service: 4/5 no complaints. Nice staff here. 

What we ordered: 4/5 Hazelnut milk tea and QQ Chatime milk tea. Tasted like Hazel nut so if you're into that get it. QQ milk tea is the bomb. It's a favourite."}
{"text":"Garbage service. The manager Lynette is clumsy and has an attitude. They first got my order wrong and while replacing my wrong order, Lynette knocked over my other drink. It splashed all over the floor,  on my shoes and pants. Lynette did not show any signs of remorse. I don't even think the word sorry came out of her mouth. You could only imagine how trash this location is when the manager is this unprofessional. If you don't have the capability of placing one drink without knocking another one over, maybe try an easier job like mopping the floor."}
{"text":"Love Chatime, excited to finally see a store opening in Mississauga. The bubble teas are great as usual, grass jelly roasted milk tea is my all time favourite. The environment could be nice and quiet and service could be fast when it's not rush hours. The only thing is, last time my friend got the mango slush and there were chunks of ice in it that she had to chew on it... Don't know if this is how it's supposed to be but I'll stick with my milk tea for now :)"}
{"text":"Reasonable price, if you have a spc card can add a free topping.but this location people more than other location.you need spend more time than others.also good for work and study?"}
{"text":"Went to cocos,  ten Ren,  and freshly squeezed.  But Chai time hits the spot for sauga bubble tea.  

 I personally enjoy the roasted oolong tea,  for a stronger flavoured tea. 

I usually get the tapioca and the grass jelly.  

Tapioca for the lovers of chewy,  grass jelly for something sweet and reminiscent of jello. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Bubble tea had no taste and taste like water. The bubbles wasn't as smooth but alittle hard when crewing it.. I had the roasted black milk tea and it doesn't taste like it's roasted at all???? The downtown Toronto location Is so much better...."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of ChaTime and I have gone to this location multiple times but it doesn't seem to live up to the standard set by other ChaTimes in Toronto. 

For example, the ever popular grass jelly roasted milk tea always tastes watered down and it doesn't have as much roasted tea flavour as it should. 

I also despise how they blend in the red bean of a matcha red bean smoothie instead of leaving it at the top. 

Embarrassingly, these issues still don't keep me away."}
{"text":"This place is my jam. I love me some bubble tea when you have to stay indoors and study through the grey Montreal winters. 

Although this chatime isn't huge, it's alot bigger than the other two at Chinatown (just a stand really) and the Guy-Concordia area one. 

This Chatime also has a digital rewards card rather than the stamp one at the Guy-Concordia area. I prefer going to Chatime when I want to study or chill with friends instead of eat (like at Nos Thes).

They also do light taiwanese snacks like cakes and waffles and rent out games so you can play with your friends."}
{"text":"I like Chatime. A few days ago, I went to Chatime at Sheppard and Yonge and I really liked it. Then I tried Chatime at Bloor and St.George. I ordered Taro milk tea a few days ago and I ordered normal sugar. It had been too sweet, so I ordered 50% half of normal sugar for the same Taro milk tea. It was perfect. Chatime at Bloor and St.George was pretty diferent from Chatime at Sheppard and Yonge. Chatime at Sheppard and Yonge has more varieties of pastries. The shop was cleaner. But both are good. Chatime will be my new favorite place."}
{"text":"This chatime can get busy at night and most times there aren't a lot of opened seats. There are a lot of people who stick around and play games and such with their friends, which is totally cool, but if you want to do that too, make sure you arrive earlier! 
The service is usually friendly and the person taking the order is always nice and helpful. But the drink quality is probably the worst out of all the chatimes. Their milk teas taste and look watered down compared to the other locations. And they often run out of tapioca/pearls at the end of the night. I haven't had the chance to try any drink other than milk teas from here but hopefully they're better !"}
{"text":"Chatime first opened in Toronto in 2011 with their Bay & Dundas location and since then has expanded to 8 stores in Mississauga, North York, Markham, Richmondhill, Pacific Mall and Waterloo! It's no surprise to me that this brand is such a success because it is a very innovative in terms of their modern store, branding, ability to customize, and being highly interaction with their customers on social media; all the while staying true to their product by brewing only high quality tea leaves sourced in Taiwan.

What sets apart Chatime from other bubble tea brands is the ability to customize your toppings (pearl, pudding, grass jelly, aloe vera, coffee jelly & the list goes on), sugar level as well as ice level. Customization is crucial to customer satisfaction these days.

Until last week, my go-to drink at this chain was the Red Bean Milk Tea, but I learned that there's so much more to Chatime ... so much more to get a taste of! We were spoiled with a bubble tea tasting and now, I will definitely need to go back for the new drinks I've tried.

Interesting Drinks to try:
- The Mousse Drinks really stood out to me! The mousse topped on top of the cold bubble tea reminded me of having that extra foam on your latte.
- The Fresh Tea/Tea Espresso Drinks, specialty tea brewed to order, are refreshing and light to take on the go with no dairy. My fave was the Japanese Sakura Sencha!
- The Energetic Mix Drinks (special Taiwan health drinks)
- They also serve coffee!"}
{"text":"Great tea time.
They make it right this is why there the best. 
Great service they are fast.
No line ups in and out . 
I even got a rewards card.
This location is just minutes from my house so I'll be spending a lot if time there.

Welcome to Mississauga ..."}
{"text":"For a franchised business, you would expect similar product quality across the board. However, this location was an absolute disappointment. 

The check-in offer, the Mango Twist, was not offered despite being available on the Yelp App. The tone in attitude given by the hostess was quite rude when I showed her the offer on my phone. 

In addition, this location did not offer tapioca and only accepted cash. Definitely not professional if you compare to the usual locations. If you want less ice in your drinks, STRESS IT! I seem to have received regular ice despite asking for less.

Chatime Lovers, save your money and use it to make a trek to a REAL location down the road at the Warden location. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Been to a handful other Chatimes in the GTA. This one is right up there with all of them.
The classic toasted milk tea with grassjelly is my recommendation here.  

The ability to customize level of sugar and ice is great service in my mind.

The parking lot is a little crowded at times, and the shop can be a little dark due to the layout. Good place to hang out. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"They didn't have grass jelly but I won't hold it against them. I went here during the Chinese New Year promo. I got a buy 1 get 1 for 0.88 cents coupon for next time. They are usable at any Chatime. Staff was friendly and accommodating and service was fast."}
{"text":"Looking for the best Bubble Tea spot in Mississauga? Look no more!! Didn't get the right order and they fixed it no problem - thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Chatime's craze has definitely dropped by a lot as new bubble tea shops started to open up across the city. But even with that note, in the downtown core I find Chatime is still one of the more dependable bubble tea shops. 

I find this location okay tea. Service is quite quick which is good when you're in a rush and the lines are not as long here. The benefit of this location is that there is more seating so you can hang out with friends or get some studies in. Wifi has always been dependable whenever I've come here."}
{"text":"Yay for the Chatime franchise to finally make it to Mississauga! Delicious bubble tea and seriously gives other bubble tea places a run for their money. The great thing is that their \"top 10 drinks\" are seriously some of the best bubble teas I've tasted. Also another thing that Chatime has always excelled in is the amount of customization you can do to your drinks.

My picks are Roasted Milk Tea and Pearl Milk Tea. Another popular choice is the Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly that seems to be a fan favourite. I heard Brown Rice Green Tea is also nice as well.

Comments:
- If you're new, go for one of the \"top 10 drinks\"
- Small drinks usually $4.20 and large usually $4.70
- Toppings such as tapioca, jelly, aloe, etc. is $0.50 extra
- Always request for less ice so less dilution
- HIGHLY recommend LESS SUGAR (either 50% or 80%) because all their drinks are sweeter than your average bubble tea, especially if you add things like tapioca. 

Cons:
- Service is very slow (I would agree even a bit slower than their GTA counterparts)
- Not a lot of sitting area, gets packed fast 

Overall, I don't find this Chatime is particularly worse/different than some of the other Chatimes in the GTA as other Yelpers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Get a vicinity card! For every 10 points you get a free drink. 

This location is always busy, and is pretty slow when it comes to serving the dishes. The set up of the cash register should be changed to flow better. 

Aside from the set up, the bubble tea here is delicious. My favourites are the qq jelly Cha time milk tea as well as the hazelnut milk tea. Both are good hot and cold. 

This bubbleteA place has definitely taken over the mississauga area, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Yes! A Chatime has finally opened in Mississauga!! I've been a fan of Chatime ever since I tried their bubble tea at the Toronto locations. They are notoriously known for having a wide variety of flavours and lineups that seem never-ending. I honestly believe Chatime is the best bubble tea franchise in the world! Similar to the other locations, this place is very linear; providing only one long row of seating. The lineups range from 5-30 minutes depending on the day and time.

Chatime has over 90 flavours and 5 toppings, providing a numerous amount of possible combinations. You can adjust the ice and sugar levels of your drink. I personally choose NO ICE and 50% SUGAR for every drink I purchase. My personal favourite drinks are: the Chatime Pearl Milk Tea, Taro Milk Tea and Honeydew Milk Tea.

Despite their drinks being top-notch, they still have room for improvement. Bubble tea lounges are viewed as a place to sit and chill with your friends, especially among teenagers. Their limited seating is what Chatime lacks compared to other bubble tea franchises such as Bubble Republic. On the other hand, they do take debit/credit which is a plus! Most bubble tea lounges do not take card which is really inconvenient.

Anyways, for any returning customers (like me), it is wise to get a Chatime Rewards card; buy 10, get 1 free!"}
{"text":"Worst cha time location in this world. Extremely poor service and overcrowded with international students shouting at the top of their lungs as they sit there without even ordering a drink.

Be prepared to line up over 20 minutes and not even have a seat to sit and enjoy your bubble tea.

The turnover is very high here. There's new employees every other week. They all look like they're slaves chain to the counter to keep mass producing bubble tea. They have a huge attitude problem every time. The employees look miserable !  

Nothing turns me off more at a store than rude and slow employees!


The only reason I come here is because of location. But since the past months, quality has gone down significantly. I rather go to another bubble tea location."}
{"text":"Bubble tea is always made properly here...always a 20-25 min wait for them to make your bbt after you order.."}
{"text":"Pretty good bubble tea! Ordered a Thai tea along with w coconut milk tea. Both good but found the Thai tea to be somewhat too sweet for my taste and the boba was slightly over cooked; a smidge too mushy."}
{"text":"The roasted tea tastes very good. I could really taste the tea. The portion of the milk has not overwhelmed the tea."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and I think it's one of the better Chatimes in town (the other franchises are something of a hit or miss).

My friend was so kind enough to treat me to a drink (even though I told her she didn't have to!).  She ordered the lychee tea with aloe vera (less ice and sugar), which was quite refreshing and slightly sweet. The aloe actually tasted kind of lychee! I got the taro milk tea (no ice and less sugar), which was quite creamy and milky. While this isn't the place to go to when you're craving the artificial flavour of taro powder, it still tastes quite good with its actual taro chunks and bits!"}
{"text":"I gotta admit im a chatime addict now. I really like d menu. My fav is still d milktea section. Chatime really set a high standard when it comes to bbt."}
{"text":"Their bubbles teas are very good, but the customer service is the worst. I've been there 4 or 5 times and almost every time they got my order wrong... I am yet really clear while ordering but every time, they're missing something. Really disappointing. However, once again, this place is great if you're looking for good bubbles teas."}
{"text":"There are better bubble tea places. 
They go through so much staff, the new employees don't know their own menu. 

They overcharge, the orders are always wrong - peak and even off-peak times. And when you point out the mistake/overcharge to them, they shrug it off!

Somehow this location always seems to be the anomaly among the others in its franchise. 
Mississauga has an abundance of bubble tea joints now. There are better places out there. Save yourself the hassle. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I find you can get good, consistent bubble tea at Chatime, and this location is no exception.  It's not too busy here, even in the summer, and they are at a good location.  I am not too picky about how my bubble tea is made, and I liked the quality of the tapioca at this place - not too chewy, and not too soft.  I always just pick up my tea and go, so I can't really comment on the decoration or ambiance."}
{"text":"Came here because of the promotion for bakery.  Got there at 4pm and all the bakeries are pretty much gone.  Checked with the staff there to see if they are making more because the promotion said it's for all day and they close at 10pm today so thinking they may make some more and I don't mind wait for it. But she said they are making anymore and what they have is already all out. Very disappointed and I'm not the only one there that is disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying chatime. Just to be safe, I ordered the milk taro bubble tea... There was chunks in my drink that I never had in my drink and taste was unfamiliar to me. I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"I go to this Chatime every now and then when I am in the area. It's a convenient location and not overly busy. But their service is horrible. I usually get those fresh tea like sakura green tea or those pu-er tea, you know, those ones that they need to make it fresh just for you. But this location does not have it. I ordered one, the guy said they don't have it. I picked another kind, he said they don't have it. So I asked him what kind of tea you have under that specialty tea section. He said they have none. I don't understand why would they even bother to have it on the menu.
So I ordered a regular milk tea with tapioca. The guy just picked up a cup already pre-filled with tapioca, and he dumped some tapioca back to the main pot. I drink chatime a lot and I felt like they gave me so little tapioca. I told the guy to add more tapioca, he turned around and told the girl who was making the tea, and she was about to seal the cup. He turned back to me and said \"Sorry, it's too late\".
I mean, the cup wasn't even sealed! First thing, I was upset how they don't have what I wanted, then they gave me a cup that was used before THEN less tapioca than it should be and THEN telling me that they can't add more because she was about to seal it.
Worst customer service."}

{"text":"The staff are a bit slow. We came with our kids and I had to ask them to change their music channel. They had songs blasting the N word and Mother F. I was surprised other parents had not complained earlier."}
{"text":"First time trying Chatime; I'm a huge fan of bubble tea but usually I stick to a handful of drinks like taro milk or green tea matcha bubble tea or original flavour bubble tea. I've never really tried the juice/tea-type drinks. Well, I decided to try my first one today because of the Yelp 50% off the mango twist offer.

I'd say the drink was solid. I generally like mango, the sweet mango I mean, but not so much the sour mango flavour which this drink was. It wasn't too bad though and the tapioca pearls were just how I liked them - chewy. They were generous with the pearls as well, which I was very happy with. When I came (Sunday afternoon), the store was nearly empty. The drink came out very quickly, within a minute and when I got it they forgot the pearls, which they noticed almost instantly and quickly fixed.

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my first trip to Chatime as well as my first non-milk bubble tea. I'm only giving it a 3/5 rating for now since I have only tried the mango twist here. There wasn't anything wrong with it, it just wasn't really my taste. I'll be back to try some of the bubble tea flavours I'm more familiar with so I can give a better, updated review."}
{"text":"This chatime location in pmall cause so much traffic as the lines go on and on. Worst they don't have a seating area for all these people as well.  Since this is such a small place they tend to run out quickly and it takes longer than avg to get your drink.  I prefer going to other locations.  Drink taste as good as all other locations."}
{"text":"Slowest one of all the chatimes in all of GTA. Also not packed with enough flavour and I just don't know why... Its like the tea is diluted or doesnt brew long enough. 

Still one of the better bubble tea in mississauga. But not as good as the ones downtown or uptown."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for bubble tea. The strawberry milk tea is probably the best I've ever had. Gave it 4 stars because the ambiance isn't great. It's always packed and very loud. Wish it had more of a coffee shop feel but not a huge deal because I can always get it for takeaway."}
{"text":"I would frequent here many times with my friends whenever we were craving bubble tea. We used to go the Bubble Republic, but I much prefer the quality of the drinks here because they have a more natural taste and color. Chatime also allows you to adjust how much sugar and ice you would like in your drink, which I always appreciate. I usually get the Roasted Grass Jelly Milk tea because it never fails to be absolutely delicious. My friends like to go for the Honeydew Milk Tea, which threw them off at first because it wasn't the bright green color they were expecting and instead just looked like your typical milk tea. Yet, when you have a sip, you'll find that it tastes far less artificial than most other places.

This place can get pretty crowded, especially since it's right near Kenzo, but I actually think that's just perfect because it's so convenient to be able to finish off your meal there and then go get some bubble tea. 

Overall, I'd say that this place has been the best for bubble tea in Mississauga and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quality drink."}
{"text":"After a 30 minute wait in line, I asked for the 32oz cup, which she told me I would have to try tomorrow for it since they just didn't have capacity to go get them from the back.  I ordered two Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Teas, neither of which ended up having grass jelly in it.  The icing on the cake was my 25 cents of change, which came to me in five fucking nickels."}
{"text":"Popcorn chicken and fried chicken is really good with 2 flavours, spicy and salty. Jasmine green milk tea with pearl 30% sugar, and chatting roasted milk tea r my fav milk tea. And mousse with milk foam is the best"}
{"text":"being from Vancouver and asian, you would think i would love bubble tea but i don't..until i had chatime. during one of my trips to Toronto...people were raving on about chatime being so good and i trash talked and said, \"it's just bubble tea, how could it be so good\". well..it is. i don't know why but its delicious. i find their bubble tea a bit stronger in tea flavor which is what i like. now that i live here, i've been indulging in chatime a little too much. but so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Chatime is always my \"go to\" when I'm craving some bubble tea. Their roasted milk tea is unmatched to any other bubble tea I've tried in the GTA. The tapioca is perfectly chewy with a slight hint of sweetness. I have tried several other flavors but my top 2 are definitely Roasted Milk Tea and QQ Taiwan Mango Juice (includes both jelly AND tapioca!)

Cha time allows you to you to choose the amount of ice and sugar for health conscious individuals, but what I've noticed is other locations (Markham cineplex) are not consistent when you order 50% sugar. The Mississauga location has always kept up with their consistency and quality. I would recommend this location as the lineup is not as long.

Order the Yelp Event:
Recently been here for the \"Order the Yelp\" event for my $2.5 bubble tea, I know another Yelper have stated the employees did not know about the event, but my experience was quite the opposite. They knew about the event immediately and although their system did not have \"Mango Twist\" they informed me that I will be receiving the special Yelp drink but they have to enter it into the system as a \"Yogurt Lemon Juice.\""}

{"text":"SOEFFINGHAPPYCHATIMEFINALLYOPENEDINMISSISSAUGA : ) Although when i went, the lines were extremely long and the place, i feel, wasnt big enough for such a super place, but their yummy drinks make up for it. I especially love the roasted milk tea with grass jelly because their grass jelly is like heaven. With all the other bubble tea places, it doesn't compare to chatime just because I feel the quality of the drinks and products are a whole lot better. Before I used to just go to Bubble Republic, but recently the prices went up and sadly the quality went down. Also, the only opportunity for me to get some chatime lovin' is only available downtown. I would always tell my friends... I hope chatime never opens in mississauga or else I'm really gonna get addicted but hey, Chatime is just one of those things where you can't help but to have one every single day for the rest of your life : 3"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!

Folks like me who may be lactose intolerant: milk powder doesn't give the runs :-D (not real dairy), at least for me. But I may not be as sensitive as other people.

honeydew milk tea tastes like the melona ice cream bar I grew up on

I like the consistency of tapioca pearls here (no misses, imo)

It's been pretty dope

There can be a huge lineup tho, goes by pretty fast but still"}
{"text":"Huge selection. Up to par with other stores in Toronto. Bubble tea is tasty and authentic. I love having the option of choosing the amount of sugar and ice you want. Decor is not so great - hard to find seats. The price is quite high in comparison to some other bubble tea places, but the quality is clearly different."}
{"text":"Great bubble teas. I like that they ask you how much sugar and ice you want. They don't just assume. 

I like mine with 50% sugar and 50% ice. That way it isn't too sweet and there is enough ice to keep it cold but not so that it's ALL ice! 

The place always has a line but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"With so many vendors for bubble tea, fruit drinks, etc., in Pacific Mall already, let's open a Chatime!  

I wish the prices were a little more competitive with the multiple outposts of Presotea.  I can get two for the price of one Chatime drink.  

Well, if you have a loyalty card, that's how they keep you loyal."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

I have been to this Chatime several times. I don't really enjoy my visit a lot because they always mess up my order. Since Yelp is hosting the \"Order the Yelp\" event, I thought it was a perfect time to revisit them and order the Yelp drink. The associates in the store didn't seem to know the promotion at all. I showed them my check in and told them I would like to redeem the 50% off promotion. They told me there was no such promotion. I showed them my Yelp check in and told them I would like to order that drink. They still insisted they didn't have that drink, but still they honoured my discount. 

It seems that they never have what I want to order:
1. There was no Yelp Drink (as per all store associates)
2. They didn't have strawberry kiwi juice that day
3. They didn't have tapioca at that time and required extra waiting time for them to make the new batch. 

-- Food and Drink --

1. Taiwan Mango QQ Juice (I was trying to order the \"Order The Yelp!\" drink - Mango Twist, since they claimed they didn't have their drink, they made the Taiwan Mango QQ Juice for me). The juice was surprisingly refreshing and wasn't too sweet. Since we got a fresh batch of tapioca, the tapioca was quite soft. 

2. Grapefruit QQ Juice - I found this drink was just average compared to other chatime branches. They added too much water in it. 

-- Overall --

I have a feeling this store is always running out of inventory. They have trouble  maintaining the quality of their drinks (sometimes their drinks are overly-sweet, sometimes they are watered down). Not a fan of this Chatime. I would only come back if my friends/family want to get a bubble tea here."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 5 minutes beside a sign that indicated where to Line Up, only to have the cashier help someone who bud me. The cashier should pay more attention to the customers in line. Thanks for saving me $5!"}
{"text":"Just your regular ol' chatime in Mississuga. Two visits here now, the most recent one for Order the Yelp (awesome event, btw!). The staff was fast and friendly, they didn't mind that my little one was grabby at the register and loud and doing all those annoying things that babies do. They even gave her an extra straw to play with. 

It's in a good area too, good food options area and a Sugar Marmalade to really amp up that sweet tooth if you need. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I LOVVVEE CHATIME!! AM so happy the opened a location here. I just found out and rushed to this place (instead of driving all the way to Toronto), to get my fix. 

I always order #1 Chatime Pearl Milk Tea or #2 Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea. Truely excellent taste. Cant get this taste anywhere else!"}
{"text":"If you like bubble tea your gonna love this place! Now with that said let me say this tea house has some \"very Asian\" (for lack of a better phrase) style teas. Some things you won't find at the average bubble tea place. Inside is very small room for about 2-3 people to stand/ wait outside for your drink."}
{"text":"It's a cute bubble tea place with a patio on Bloor Street. 

I like that this brand asks you for the amount of sugar and ice to add in your drink."}
{"text":"As in almost all the places in montreal, it's very hard to find parking close to this place, inside is tiny, no place to sit or even try to get in there is imposible.
Their drinks are ok, nothing special about it, but if what you are looking for is the Boba in your drink this is the right place."}
{"text":"Long line at this boba joint compared to others, must be good right? Mind you, there were boba options in almost every aisle. The line to order was long, but the wait was even longer to get the drink. 1 drink came out and another 10 minutes passed before the other drink came out. The staff member apologized, but when I finally took a sip of the mango slush, it wasn't really worth the wait. Although asked for less sweet, it was still pretty sweet. I will admit that the weather was a bit humid so a cold slush was refreshing. However, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good location nice service! 
Love there roasted milk tea and Thai milk tea. 
Go there 3 times a week and server is very friendly. 
Only thing I don't like is that sometimes take a while for my drink to be serve"}
{"text":"Not too impressed considering it was a quiet hour around 6pm. Got a roasted milk tea with tapioca and they left out the tapioca.... on top of that I waited a while for my drink when there was no one else in line/waiting. Slow service and messed up my order... i would really reconsider revisiting this location."}
{"text":"New location in Mississauga, finally!

We arrived at 8pm on a Sunday and the lineup began outside. I didn't mind the wait but it ended up being 30 minutes.

I ordered QQ Grapefruit Juice and it was fantastic. Found a new favorite!

We sat down together and enjoyed our drinks. Even though it was busy, there was lots of available seats because most people take the drinks to go.

If you're in the area and craving bbt, check this location out!"}
{"text":"Tea is good. Service is meh. I don't really like the location (dingy plaza).

Came here for my fav no. 2. Close to U of T campus, really convenient for students. The tea is good as usual. The service is okay, nothing spectacular. The inside seating area seems nice and comfy. The outside area looks a bit more sketchy and dirty, they should consider giving it a face lift. Otherwise good convenient location, great tea."}
{"text":"I come here frequently because the location is convenient and the bubble tea is nicer than at most other places.
However the bubble tea tastes like there's no tea in it. I highly recommend the mango smoothie though.
And it is a bit ironic but the fact it's always so busy was a big reason for me to stop coming here. For example, one time I was waiting around while people who came after me were getting their drinks. After an embarrassing mix up with another customer I found out my drink had been ready for some time but simply hadn't been called out. No big tragedy, it happens, but it was a negative experience that I'd rather avoid by going to to a quieter place.  If you dislike crowded and rushed places too maybe you will also dislike this Chatime."}
{"text":"So happy to see this location open up. Let's hope it sticks around! This particular space has seen a revolving door of eateries come and go, so I really hope it's around for a while. I really like chatime! Unlike the other locations that I've been to, I've yet to see this location to be too busy.

Drinks are pricy - Almost $6 when you include taxes for a large. I adore their drink #2 - the milk tea with grass jelly. I really like that Chatime lets you control the amount of sugar you like in your drink - no sugar, 30%, 50%, 80% or full.

I often see students with their laptops working and using their free wi-fi. Given how not busy it often is, it's not a bad place to study with a tasty drink."}
{"text":"Not my first visit! Chatime is my GO TO for bubble tea! I will drive from south shore to Montreal to get it so good! The place is a little loud as expected due to blenders going off and people talking. Close to Concordia university quite convenient for students! 

Love how they have different flavours to try out! But I mostly stick to what I love! Lychee yogurt QQ (30%sugar&ice) and milk tea with pearls. I tried the milk tea hazelnut  with pearls LOVE IT!

One issue is their wifi is a little unstable at times.

They ask what % sugar and ice, they don't just assume. Very friendly staff as-well! It's worth it even if there's a line up!"}
{"text":"Chatime is so addictive!  This location makes them the best!

Stick their special...#2 with tapioca!

Must go if you like bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Love the bubbly atmosphere of this place, as well as their huge variety of drink choices. The staff is friendly and polite, but the drinks do tend to take a while at their prime hours (around 3-5pm). You'd have to have a fair amount of cash on you though, as $5 is their average price, while a $3-4 drink would be the absolute minimum they serve (I'd feel guilty for using all their wifi without buying anything, so this is quite unfortunate for what the serving size is).

It's always pretty busy (and therefore usually loud), so I wouldn't suggest studying here, but I do hope they offer light snacks/desserts in the near future to potentially cater to more clientele. I love their long hours, and hope to come back again for the student passbook!"}
{"text":"I love Chatime; it's a great place to grab a bubble tea to go, or to sit down and study. 

It's a two floor establishment with decent seating on both floors. There are booths in the back of the ground level, and there are tables and a lounge-type seating area facing the windows on the second floor. 

They have a wide selection of bubble teas, which is always great to see. Their top picks are safe choices, and I've always enjoyed their Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea. You can \"customize\" your bubble tea with the percentage of sugar, ice, and toppings. Toppings are extra, but I highly recommend getting their grass jelly! 

They also offer some pastries, including some custard tarts and egg waffles. I'll have to swing by soon to try them! 

They offer free wifi, which is pretty stable. The only possible knock in this regard is that the sound from the ground floor (from blenders, conversation, mixing ice, etc) easily travels to the second floor, so this should be something you should be aware of if you're expecting complete silence.

If you're in the area and looking for a great place to study with some bubble tea, Chatime has a great sit-down vibe. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I may quite possibly be the only person on this planet who is not a fan of Chatime. I've ordered the famous roasted jelly milk tea three times thinking that maybe the first, and second person made it wrong but nope. I just don't get the hype? It's bland and I've never ordered less sugar? maybe I should up my sugar? It tastes like regular barley tea mixed with milk sugar and the blandest tapiocas I've ever tasted. I don't know - to each their own, but I like my tapiocas on the sweeter side. The wintermelon milk tea is what I'd come back for, although I've tasted much better wintermelon tea in those cardboard box drinks.. so really I'm lieing. Is there something wrong with me?"}
{"text":"Probably the best bubble tea in Montreal in terms of taste. But service time is extremely slow and line is long. I guess the good taste is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This chatime has a great interior. It's a great spot for chilling. And even had an outdoor patio! I've been to the one on Yonge a few times, and the atmosphere at the Bloor location is wayy less hectic. More sitting room, chill atmosphere, and same great bubble teas. I love that you can pick the level of sweetness.

I've had the grass jelly roasted milk tea with 30% sugar and no ice. Really tasty! This time I got the taro milk tea with tapioca, no sugar and no ice. The taro is a bit grainy in texture and the tapioca was sweet so it actually was fine with no sugar. I prefer the roasted the roasted milk tea though. Every sip was either tapioca or grass jelly - maybe next time I could ask for less."}
{"text":"The only place I go to for bubble tea!! I am not a fan of fruit flavoured bubble teas. The only thing I really get from here is their roasted milk tea with some pearls or pudding. It is AMAZING! I usually get mine with 30% ice and regular sugar and it is just divine! It's not always amazing though, sometimes it's too watered down."}
{"text":"Family's favorite drink for a while now. My initial favorite is taro smoothie with pearls. But after i tried their #2 of 10 favorites which is the grass jelly roasted milk tea, it has been my favorite for a while now. You have option how much ice and sugar you like. Taste sooo good!!! They also have points card(vicinity) so i get free regular size drink for every 10 points. They even give New year's card that is $.88 for a regular size drink!! There is always line but the service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Maybe there is such a thing as being too popular?

You can have the greatest product in the world, but if the process to obtain it is unpleasant then I won't return. 

This is the case with cha time. This particular location has a terribly busy parking lot, definitely not enough to hold all the college students mercedes benzs(???). 

 I will admit that I do enjoy the drinks here, and the selection is unparalleled. But I am not a bubble tea fanatic, and I don't need a hundred choices, nor would I probably be able to distinguish between the milk tea of different establishments. 

Also the line ups are atrocious. At some point you have to determine the value of your time. And waiting 45 mins to an hour for a drink I then have to drink in my car because all the seats are taken isn't my cup of tea. The seating in this place isn't comfortable anyway, and not conducive to socializing in the way that \"green grotto\", or \"orange caramel cafe\" is. 

There is a serious lack of comfort here, that is only amplified when you consider the alternatives. Green gotto is so close and so much more comfortable. 

This place has the potential to be the \"starbucks\" of bubble tea for the world(it nearly is already). But it needs to follow the starbucks model and get bigger more comfortable locations. And food options wouldn't hurt too."}
{"text":"I've been to the Downtown Toronto locations, North York, and Vaughan, and this is hands down the worst location I've been to. I have been to this Chatime several times and about 80% of the time they've run out of tapioca (typically at night). There is usually a long line accompanied with atleast a 10-15min wait time for your drink. I keep wanting to give them a chance  but think I will stick to CoCo Fresh Tea & Juice or Bubble Republic in that area."}
{"text":"Chatime is still my favourite bubble tea spot, but OMG what is up with the service in here?
I came here over the weekend and the line up was out the door. Ummm...it's winter. 
I waited in line for about 15-20 minutes and by the time I came closer to the counter I noticed a tiny sign that read, \"NO TAPIOCA\". 

Are you kidding me? What is a bubble tea without tapioca. 
So I left. I let the other people in line know there wasn't any tapioca and half the line up was out the door. No surprise here. 

Hey Chatime, if there is no tapioca - it would be nice to let your customers know with a BIG sign that claims that. Maybe a sign by the door or stuck on the top where the tea menus are. 
It's a huge waste of time waiting in line, *especially* in the dead of winter, to only be disappointed with such non sense.
Also, 2 registers would be a great help too!"}
{"text":"This is the WORST Chatime location.  The staff are so rude and possess no concept of customer service.  We have been here over 6 or 7 times and our orders have always been wrong.  At first we would inform them of the mistakes while they roll their eyes and just grab the drinks out of our hands and remake it so unwillingly.  What the heck kind of attitude is this.  I asked them what is wrong and to not remake it if it's so hard and you don't want to be cause I don't deserve to see this kind of attitude as a paying customer.  

During the last visit was what would be our last visit.  We got 3 drinks and all were wrong, mine tasted like diabetes sweet when I asked for NO sugar, husband got tapioca when asked for grass jelly and friend's got free tapioca when she didn't want any!

To Kenton Chan: I hope you read this review and realize the poor training and lack of customer care that your staffs exhibit and act upon this before all your years of hard rock will get tarnished."}
{"text":"Chatime franchise that needs better customer service and maybe an extra register.

Always seem to be waiting just to place an order.
Out of all the employees there are like maybe just 2 or 1 that learned how to properly treat people without being rude.

Desperately need customer service retraining.

Will change my review when things change"}
{"text":"They changed the tables and chairs! Much more seats than before! Drinks still taste the same as when it was first opened! Never disappointed there. Sometimes it could be long to get our drinks though...

I wanted to try the winter honey lemon drink, and they can never make it. Should just remove it from the menu... :("}
{"text":"I got their tea standard and it was waaaaaay too sweet for me. I would recommend taking the sugar down a notch when they ask you if you'd like less. The staff is not nice or rude. They're pretty much just like robots, but I feel like everyone who works at the Pacific Mall is like that. Teenagers who don't care about much. I won't ever return here, but honestly it's because there are better places nearby."}
{"text":"Drinks are good except one major complaint I have is, why the heck are they always out of tapioca???!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Chatime and frequent a lot of other bubble tea locations in the city, but I have to say, this one is really lacking in comparison. The staff quality and knowledge is extremely inconsistent, some days they are really organized and efficient, and others it's pure chaos. It can be a really busy day or a quiet one, it makes no difference. They ran out of pearls the other day at 3pm in the afternoon on a Saturday but weren't telling people until after they ordered, which is strange. Also the food case is poorly maintained and looks gross, despite desperately wanting to try their macarons, I don't think I ever will.

I will never sit and stay at this location either because their seating areas are often messy and un-wiped, and the bathrooms are pretty gross. 

That said, it all tastes as good as any other location, the staff are never rude if they aren't very helpful, I just wish this one was more consistent to the brand."}
{"text":"3.5 rating

This location is pretty big and they have comfy seating! I ordered a hot grass jelly roasted milk tea because it was really cold yesterday, but the guy told me having it hot will melt the grass jelly so they can just make it warm. When I got the drink, it was just lukewarm and then eventually got cold. I guess next time, if I want a hot milk tea it won't be the grass jelly roasted milk tea (my go to drink)."}
{"text":"I noticed a few new things offered by Chatime this Spring (see photos)!
 1) Egg waffles with ice cream: 
We tried the matcha/red beans waffles - there's actually red beans in each \"bump\" of the waffle! Yummy!
2) Board games you can borrow. If a lot of people request a game, they will buy it! For now they have Uno, poker, Bang!, Werewolves, Carcassonne, Walk the plank! and Cockroach poker. They ask for a student ID to borrow, but I don't see the reason why.
3) A new line of \"Sky Dream\" drinks, featuring butterfly pea - colored juice: I don't think the butterfly pea (it has quite a cheeky latin name) actually tastes anything. It just gives a pretty blue/purple color, like how its used in Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"I love the Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly! The drink is so creamy and it's a nice change from having tapioca in my drink. My only complaint is the long line ups and that although they advertise free wifi, you can't connect to it."}
{"text":"Convenient bubble tea place by University of Calgary, offering a wide range of flavours for Taiwanese milk tea. Quality is decent enough and you can customize it to your liking. It tends to be a little busy so service is a little slower. Can't go wrong with a cup of bubble tea a day"}
{"text":"Yes everyone, a new bubble tea place has arrived to Montreal! This time, it's a well-known one because apparently it's all over the world! I was extremely excited to try this place because they had a grand opening special where it was buy one, get second one free. I came back on Monday with a friend and decided to test out their bubble tea by ordering the classic original milk black tea. Personally I find if a bubble tea cafe can make a classic well, they can make other bubble teas well too. 

The verdict? Pretty darn good milk black tea. It was the perfect balance between bitter and sweet. In fact Chatime offers you the choice of how much percentage of sugar you want and ice too. For example you can order 30% sugar or 30% ice meaning it's the lowest amount of ice and sugar. I think it's pretty cool they have this option.

Now, I was so excited about this place that I went a second time and ordered something different. I had the Matcha Red Bean smoothie with 80& sugar, holy holy it was good. I loved that it was perfectly not too overly sweet and I could taste the red bean and matcha. There wasn't too much ice nor was it diluted.

My only complaint about Chatime is their space. I believe it used to be a clothing store and so the spacing is odd. It feels empty and I don't really feel like going there to sit and study, or just sit there for awhile in general. The design lacks a bit interior wise.

Other than that, must try their bubble teas if you are in the Guy downtown area."}
{"text":"After my third visit to Chatime, I'm really enjoying it! They have such an extensive menu-- so many flavors and styles to choose from and you can even choose how much ice and sugar you want added.
My only issue is that as someone who doesn't like very sweet things, even with 0% sugar, I find the drinks to be quite sweet. This may be due to the fact that they use syrup to add some of the flavoring (I saw them do this with the Coconut Milk Tea). Still delicious though :)  Perhaps they have other options that are flavored without the use of sweet syrup.
It's also a good place to casually study. They have an upstairs with quite a few tables that is well lit due to the big windows and has a nice, clean ambience.  Also a great place to sit and chat with friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place but customer service is extremely slow, the line goes all around the store and it takes about 20 min to get at least close to the counter comparing this to the Vaughan location which takes under than 10 min to order and leave. I don't recommend coming here if you're in a rush"}
{"text":"I have a hard time ranking bubble tea as I've never been into the entire BBT fad.  However, I can tell a bad bubble tea from a good one. I consider a bad one that is full of powder and does not take anything like fruit and a good one should not have a powder taste, not too sugary, and if it is a fruit drink, it should actually taste like fruit.  Wow, that sounds so self-explanatory.  

I went to Chatime on a Friday afternoon, and it was not busy. I got the medium roasted milk tea with pearls and I paid just over $5 tax included.  

It was good, but it didn't blow me away, but it was much better than Bubble Tease.  I could taste the tea and the tapioca was nice and chewy.  However, I don't see why people would stay in line for an hour for bubble tea. Maybe 15-20 minutes or so.  

Verdict: I'd take my BBT friends here, but it wouldn't be for anyone who appreciates value as really, you are paying $5 for tea and some tapioaca."}
{"text":"Dropped in around 2 on a Saturday after having lunch next door. It was the first time for both my boyfriend and I. Thankfully it was not busy whatsoever, contrary to what I read in Yelp reviews prior to visiting, and the colour scheme of the shop really appealed to me. The amount of options on the menu was incredibly overwhelming for me, and although I probably should have stuck with my original plan of ordering the classic Pearl Milk Tea and a matcha macaron, instead I bought a milk tea made with jasmine green tea... hot... with 30% sugar. To me, it kinda tasted like I was consuming warm but scented hand lotion. The amount of milk in my drink seemed a bit excessive, and even at 30%, the sweetness levels were still a bit higher than I would have preferred. Would I purchase that drink again? No. But I would definitely be interested in trying other flavours in the future. Maybe get some tapioca as well."}
{"text":"Usually I'm just an inactive Yelp user but today I am really disappointed by Chatime that I want to warn anybody before going to this place. 
The place is kind of dirty. My table still has some dirty stains and straw wrapper on it. 
The tea is over sweet and I don't feel tea at all, just milk and syrup. However the tapioca here is great, hence 1 star for that. Large size in this place is not so large though and I find it really expensive comparing to the competitors.
There are 2 wifis in this place but none of them works. 
What else can I say. Save yourself some time and money, go to Nosthes or even Un magasin de breuvage!"}
{"text":"Got the mango twist with aloe Vera. 
Comes with a lot of flavout, both the mango twist and the aloe Vera. Had a nice cozy feel inside. Unfortunately, the Wifi was down but definitely would be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here a few times. This Chatime is at the plaza at Woodbine and 16th. There's an adequate amount of parking as it is the inside of the plaza, further away from the chaos at T&T.

The bubble tea is $4.80 plus tax for a regular milk tea with tapioca (which I think is the standard price now). They have multiple options that you can choose, two of the most common is the level of sugar and ice you want in your drink. I like how when you ask for no ice, this chatime doesn't deduct the amount of drink there is (I wouldn't be surprised if they fill it up with more water, but it certainly doesn't taste like they did).

This Chatime is partnered up with Bakecode, so they have delicious and fresh cakes, macarons and tarts for you to order. They also have extremely expensive, but creative buns for you to eat. It's quite fancy, but if you want just something a little more typical, T&T is literally right across the plaza. 

I'm always here when it's not peak hours, so I've never experienced the extended wait times that some folks are saying in their reviews. Usually I'm the first or second one in line and our drinks are usually always made under five minutes. The tapioca pearls are also okay too, usually cooked decently when I visit.

I'm not much of a sitter at a bubble tea shop anymore either, it's usually grabbed to go, so I don't mind if they have seats in their stores or not. This Chatime I must admit have much fewer seats than other Chatimes I have been to. This Chatime is different in it's own way because it's not as purple after the collab with Bake Code."}
{"text":"My friends have urged me to stop going to Chatime, but, alas, I can't keep away. I like this location much better than the original Yonge/Dundas one for one reason only: MORE SPACE. This location feels much less cramped because the line-up area and the seating area are divided by a low wall - it makes for better crowd control (I'm sure the employees enjoy this as well). 

The location is also very good, especially for UofT students. Being on the corner of St. George and Bloor, right next to the Bata Shoe Museum, it's convenient for commuters and students alike. As a UofT student, I am both delighted, and sad that this location has opened. Delighted because I won't have to trek down to the Yonge/Dundas location for my grass jelly fix, but sad, because my wallet is surely taking a beating."}
{"text":"Was stopping by Mississauga, and wanted my bubble tea fix.  Decided to get the new twilight series, tried the grapefruit blush. The presentation is very nice with the colour blend.  

However they don't recommend toppings because it will disturb the colour and not look good. 

It tastes like a grapefruit tea, and missing something without a topping, very plain. 
Interesting concept though. 

Clean inside, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been to all chatime in Montreal, so far St-Catherine is the best. Tastefull, good service and I can collect for the stamp :D 
My all time favorite \"pearl milk tea, 30% ice & sugar\""}
{"text":"The drinks are aways great but the service is always well under par with extremely rude staff."}
{"text":"Small and busy parking lot but great drinks!! I usually get the roasted milk tea with grass jelly (30% sugar) with less ice and it's more than sweet enough. They are pricey but a good treat. They do have wifi though and bathrooms... could be a bonus for some. Drinks take a while depending on what time you go. I've only ever gone during lunch and it's been empty."}
{"text":"I Ordered the Yelp (event now over)! Got a Mango Twist (large size) for $2.50+tax! There was some confusion, as they said they did not have that drink yet, but upon consulting the manager, they made me a mango flavored drink. The guy who was making my drink had to ask her how to make it, and she said something mango, something lemon. Taste-wise, it wasn't powdery, but it wasn't pure mango deliciousness either. According to the description found in the event, it was supposed to be mango and yogurt. I couldn't taste the yogurt, and the drink definitely didn't look yogurty, but for $2.50, it was a very good deal. Considering that the drinks at Taste of Asia outside when I came, I'm thankful Order the Yelp had this deal for me to take advantage of!"}
{"text":"Great bubble tea place in downtown Sainte Catherine. The drinks are refreshing and you can customize the level of sweetness in your drink."}
{"text":"The milk tea tastes EXCELLENT!! My favorite would be the the taro milk tea with pudding and bubbles, half sugar and minimum ice."}
{"text":"Probably the best bubble tea I've ever had! I love this place. I like to try something new most of the time, but my go to is Peach Slush or Banana Milk Tea (with tapioca of course)! My boyfriend always gets the Mango Slush. 

The lines are long during busy times, so he prepared to wait in line at least 10 minutes. 

I tried some pastries from their bakery, Bake Code, and it was alright. The presentation is nice, but the flavor of them are kind of bland.

Try the peach slush if you come here! You won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"While this location is much  closer to me, I find myself preferring to travel to further ones as the service here is far too slow and poorly managed. Always running out of tapioca etc and averaging 25+ mins for one drink? It would be faster for me to drive to highway 7 and back. 

It's been open for almost 2 years now. No more excuses."}
{"text":"Can we use another Asian Boba cafe in Mississauga?

I guess so, if it is a good one.  I think Chatime is pretty good for the gendre of Asian drink it is serving.

Decor: B+
Service: B+
Price: A
Quality: A-
Wifi: FFF

These Asian drinks cost an arm & leg these days, and I Chatime offer good value for the price.  Their regular size drink was about 4.50, which was equal to the large drink of other boba cafe in the area.  Their large was 5.50 but that is about at least a dollar cheaper than local competition.

I tried their Milk Tea with large boba balls, and it was excellent.  Today I tried their macha smoothie with boba, and I thought it was ok, but nothing great.

I would go back to this place, if nothing else for the good price they offer and cleanliness. And I did like their Milk Tea, so I would recommend this place.

BBjL

PS: On Yelp and other review sites, it says they have free wifi.  Well, the lord giveth and taketh, and the lord of this place decided he will taketh away the wifi from his loyal customers.  I asked the cashier what the wifi password was, and he responded by saying - he forgot and can't remember - very lame.   So I like their drinks but I will look around to find another place that do not withhold wifi from their loyal customers."}
{"text":"Half chatime and half bake code! Always a good duo.
It's super close to home too, but somehow I find myself driving to the other locations rather than this one. Not that they're bad, they just aren't.. great? It's never too packed here though - in fact, every time I come in, there's room to sit.

They work at a pretty quick pace here and they've never messed up my drink, so all is good in my books. They're just very mediocre and the staff aren't rude/mean, but aren't exactly welcoming and friendly either. I think in general most chatimes need to train their employees on customer service - seriously (back in my starbucks days, we went through HEAVY customer service training and that's why they have such loyal customers). Chatime only has loyal customers because their drinks are delicious and always a treat. Fave drink is the QQ taiwan mango juice with no sugar and less ice - I feel like it's naturally sweet and doesn't require any extra sugar. In fact, 90% of their drinks are.

Another point- their bake code items are always running low.. not sure why but the displays are a lot more sparse than other bake codes I go to. Merp. Also, bake code is soooooOoOOOo good, but also makes a dent in my wallet. My mother will never understand why I purchase $6 croissants when we can go to the asian bakery and get 6 asian buns cheap and tax free.

Not bad, not amazing. It's A-OK."}
{"text":"When they are slow, they sure as hell are slow.

Why would people buy chatime in pacific mall when there are so many cheaper options? Go to every other place that offers the buy 1 get 1 free fresh mango slush for the price of 1 chatime. This chatime is busy most of the time, especially after school when all the hungry teens bus in from high school. The line moves so. so. so. slowly & what's worse is I don't know what's worse- the line to pay or the line to pick up your drink. Even when I'm the only one in line, it always take forever to get my drink. Bleh, I'm not paying $6 to have my time wasted?! 
The drinks are consistent with every other chatime- obviously delicious, so no complaining over there. No chatime deserves a 1 star (except spawn of satan chatime richmond hill.. refer to that review after this) because their milk tea is oh so royal and they sure know how to brew their tea. 

The servers here are nice too, no matter how slow they are."}
{"text":"If I could give negative points I would. I love bubble tea, I love tea, I love sugar and I love chatime. But boy does this location suck. Not only did the drinks taste weird but the custom service is horrendous!

My friends and I ordered; salted creama green tea, chocolate mouse, and two blueberry roasted tea.

I've had both the chocolate mouse and salted creama green tea from other locations but this by far is the worst. The chocolate mouse tasted my grainy nesquik powder that hadn't even been dissolved into the mixture yet. And the salted creama green tea literally, LITERALLY tasted like water. 

When I told the employees they didn't not look so happy about making a new one but they made my a new and literally again water with creama. When I brought it up the 'manager' said that I had to mix the creama into the green tea. I told her this wasn't my first time ordering this style of drink and she said we'll even if we make again it'll taste the same... uhm okay great customer service. And finally she said okay the green tea they had was bad today... so why are you serving it? Interesting... they didn't offer to refund my drink which is quite disappointing, I spent 5 dollars for water and cream. 

And my two friend who ordered the roasted blueberry drink wanted 30 minutes only to be asked to change their drinks because they over sold the blueberry drink. Which is pretty ridiculous to wait 30 minutes expecting a drink only to be asked to change your order of something else. I understand you guys are busy but once you realize you're out of something tell the customer. Don't make them wait an excruciatingly long amount of time for a mediocre at best drink."}
{"text":"A Granny apple Green Tea is doesn't taste like Granny Apple, it's taste more like syrup and water! It's the worst bubble tea I ever have. Don't think there is next time."}
{"text":"For the longest time now, I've heard that Chatime is the best of the bubble tea franchises out there, however it was always unfortunate that the closest ones were so far away...

How delighted I was to hear that they were placing one literally behind my house! (you can see my room from the restaurant front door!)

Being a former employee of another bubble tea café chain (I realize that if you view my other reviews, I tend to use this \"I've worked at a previous different locations before\", but I assure you: Sushi and bubble tea, that's it) so I have pre-existing standards for not only the taste of the bubble tea-but everything else too: service time, friendliness, etc.

So the first thing I notice when I enter the shop is that this unit is small. The store was able to seat about 20, which sounds relatively large, but when you consider that it's 5 tables of 4 seats, it's not that good. Compared to the medium sized Bubble republic which could fit approximately 50(?) and the larger sized bubble tease in heartland which could fit 75ish, this place is miniscule. 
The layout of the store as well is not the greatest. The door placement causes the line to run straight down the restaurant, where a customer will place an order on the left side of the line, swim through the line to get to the back of the already populated waiting area and  listen carefully through the ambient noise for your order. When you hear your order, you need to fight through:
- Idle customers who have already received their order and are waiting with their friends for their orders, 
-Customers who have just received their orders and are throwing out their straw wrappers in the inconveniently placed garbage bin,
- Customers still waiting for their orders constantly cross referencing their order chits with the number the tea maker has just yelled,
-  A Jehovah's Witness
- The elite four
- the Kraken.

Jokes aside (The elite four weren't really there) it took us about 10 minutes wait time to get our drinks, which I consider to be pretty fast given the large amount of orders. When you get your order you can either choose to find a table on the other side of the line, or leave. Luckily for my girlfriend and I, we were able to find a table to have our drinks at. Seeing as she wasn't feeling well, she ordered a hot Taro milk tea with tapioca, and I wanted to try something new, so I ordered the hazelnut chocolate milk tea. My drink was decent; a chocolate milk with a hint of what I would assume to be hazelnut. I was expecting a Nutella bubble tea, but this was quite good nonetheless.  Her Bubble tea, however, was amazing! It wasn't overly sweet like many other places, and it taro flavour was a lot different from what I am used to. It was a refreshing change of pace. 

All in all, I'd say that this place is a good place to go if you're looking for an amazing bubble tea to go.  They have a much larger variety of items than other places, so I'll definitely be back to try them out. The small unit plus the busy atmosphere made for a rather stressful visit, but we're here for the food, not the stay.  That said I'd give this place 4/5 for its speedy/friendly service and above par drinks.

Next time we go, I'll make sure to just jump my fence to get back home and have my drink there.

TL;DR - Place is busy, drink is good. 4/5"}
{"text":"Everyone overhypes up Chatime, and I before you guys think I'm going to say that everyone is wrong, no in fact everyone should be hyping this up. This is like goddamn Asian Starbucks.

Like one Asian dude looked at Starbucks one day and went: (Read in any Oriental Asian accent) \"Starbucks is doing pretty good now, I wonder why. I think it's because all the white people love coffee. Wait. All the Asian people like bubble tea. Why don't I just do the same thing?\"

BOOM. Instant success.

I lined up for an hour for one of their drinks, and in the end I wasn't even mad. 
It was really good. Maybe it's because I got super thirsty waiting for a drink, but doesn't matter because I did drink all of one regular in less than a minute.

People are giving bad reviews to these guys, and it's probably because they have high expectations of a freaking bubble tea place. Give them a break, it's clearly better than Bubble Republic."}
{"text":"Located near the UofT Campus, this is quite the popular spot for your bubble tea fix. Came here with friends and it was quite busy but we were able to get a seat. It's conveniently located right off St. George Station and right beside Gyubee. You can't go wrong with Chatime so it's a great choice to get bubble tea here with their extensive drink menu. They always have different promotions and are always releasing different drinks from time to time. Overall, pretty good. It does get busy here with students studying so you might not get a seat at times. Will definitely be coming back here for some delicious bubble tea!"}
{"text":"I am so glad they opened up a Chatime near campus (I can literally get there in two minutes after class). So far, the quality of the BBTs have been consistent and up to par with the Dundas location. My favourites are the taro milk tea and the roasted milk tea. Hope they open up more locations!"}
{"text":"Living on the west end of the GTA isn't synonymous with having a wide range of choices when it comes to bubble tea. There's the famous Bubble Republic, relatively obscure Bamboo Bubble Tea, and the surging KooKoo Chicken. Other than these establishments, I can't think of another place I can go to reliably for good BBT. 

Enter Chatime. 

Widely known in the GTA for its extensive list of flavours and its endless lineups, Chatime is arguably the best BBT chain in the city. They recently expanded to Mississauga in August 2014 - opening up a location at a plaza on Mavis and Burnhamthorpe. The new location is neighboured a couple units down by another popular asian chain, Kenzo Ramen. 

Like other locations, this unit is quite narrow, providing for only one long row of seating. The lineups, which can be expected to range anywhere from 5-40 minutes depending on time and day, form a straight line that frequently goes right out the main entrance. 

Chatime has over 80 flavours and 5 toppings, providing for endless combinations. Like most teahouses, they allow you to customize the sugar and ice levels in your drink. Personally, I'd recommend to ask for less ice and 50% sugar with every order. 

Aware of the confusion that having so many options may result in, they have a list of the top 10 most popular drinks. My personal favourites are the grass jelly roasted milk tea, Chatime pearl milk tea, and the wintermelon mousse with pearls. If you're more inclined to try a fruity flavour, the Taiwan mango juice, as well as any of the fruit milk teas, are great choices as well. 

Being a huge Chatime fan way before they opened in Mississauga, I had hopes that they would absolutely destroy the competition, taking customers from all over the city. However, being realistic, they do have room for improvement. 

BBT lounges are seen as places to hang out, especially among the teenage population. This is what makes places like Bubble Republic so popular. Chatime doesn't have the floor area to compete with BR from this standpoint. 

One thing it does have control over, however, are their store hours. Currently, Chatime is open until midnight, 7 days a week. BR has later opening hours during weekends, which are, again, a popular time to go for BBT. Becoming a late night option in Mississauga, which is sorely lacking in the category, should be an option they consider. Other locations are open later on weekends, so the early closing times may be an short-run operational decision. 

Had they considered those two changes, Chatime may have had the ability to capture the majority of the Mississauga market. As of now, they are still leaving room for other businesses like BR to compete. What's not in question, though, is the fact that they have better bubble tea. They also accept debit and credit, an option that BR has always lacked.

Having Chatime in the city is great for Mississauga. It puts pressure on the competition where there wasn't much competition before. Hopefully it encourages continued growth and improvement in the Asian specialty drink industry, and leads to further investment in Mississauga from popular Asian chains. 

Tip: If you love it so much that you plan on going back, again.. and again.. and again, then get a Vicinity rewards card next time you make an order. Buy 10, get 1 free."}
{"text":"I LOVE chatime. I can't emphasize it enough. The grass jelly roasted milk tea + caramel pudding is what I live for. I use to drag my poor boyfriend with me here every other day waiting in long line ups just to feed my urges. There's something about chatime when you walk in there's just such a soothing aroma. I would probably buy a chatime candle if they had one."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Montreal, I always need to get Chatime and Nos The.
This spot is really cozy and perfect for studying. Drinks are delicious as usual! 
Close to student housing so there are a lot of students, but it is not too loud."}
{"text":"For some reason, this chatime was pretty empty when I went, but that just means less waiting for me! Quality is always consistent, and I get the roasted oolong milk tea with grass jelly. Super creamy and not too sweet (get 30% sweet and less ice)! If I go to Montreal I always bring one back home."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Chatime, however starting to dislike chatime more and more as I go to various locations and get disappointed each time. I ordered 2 large taro smoothies with tapioca, and by the time me and my boyfriend took a sip, we had just got on the highway close by and at that point, couldn't go back. The drinks tasted water-downed with a tiny hint of taro flavor. I watched the young girl make he drinks and noticed she put so much ice in the blender. Next time for any location, especially this location, I will try the drink before I leave because for the name, cost and reputation, I expect good quality and tasting drinks."}
{"text":"Location
Modern, albeit small, space. Shared parking with the computer store beside it.  Gets busy during weekends. 

Service
Maybe we came at night, but the staff seem pretty aloof.  It wasn't busy when we went, but we  felt rushed when ordering.  

Food
Well, Chatime is one of the good bubble tea shops -- no doubt about that.  Loved the roasted milk tea and genmaicha tea -- hot or cold. 

Overall
Really a 2.5, rounding off to 3.  Need to work on service, but still a good hangout spot for your bubble tea fix."}
{"text":"Their bread were not made in this shop, they just delivered from other location and delayed after noon. If you want fresh croissant and get it before noon, you may wanna try other locations."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Chatime to open in Mississauga for some time now.  I used to venture to the ones in the other parts of the GTA when I was nearby (or I would specifically go make a trip to get it LOL).

I am super addicted to their Roasted Milk Tea!!  I haven't found anything like it at any other bubble tea place.  It is one of their signature drinks for a good reason.
I usually get it with either tapioca, or pudding (tastes like custard), and less ice, 50% sweet.

They take Vicinity points card, so remember to use it to save up for your free drink.

I would say, compared to the other locations in GTA, this one is a lot slower in service.  Takes awhile for you to get your drink.  Also, they tend to run out of the pudding topping quite often when I am there, which is a bummer if I am craving it.

They also now have a large HOT size, which is great for these cold winter months :)"}
{"text":"Love this location. Even if there was no air conditioning the day we went (there was a fan). We were here for ours, and yes, we ordered several drinks to make up for the time spent there. The chairs were comfy, the drinks were delicious, and the wifi was amazing. 

We visited another Chatime nearer downtown, but that one didn't take credit card and the wifi didn't work at all."}
{"text":"Every time another Chatime store opens, I smile and lock it into my Nav system. In this case, there are a few more benefits. More parking, and an easier access parking lot are a benefit. Secondly, having a Bake Code store in the same place is never (always) a good thing. The Croissant Brûlée is addictive. 

But wait! There's more!  Bake Code is a unique compliment to Chatime.  There are a variety of pastries and cakes that are totally different than anything I have seen at a typical bakery.  They are all pretty artistic in their design and just taste really good.  Grab a tea, and something to snack on in the car--distracted driving be damned! After all, we're pro's.

I really need someone to open a Chatime in Newmarket/Aurora before I wind up buying a franchise for myself.  Anyone?  Anyone?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's a no for me. 

I have tried their Pearl Milk Tea (don't know the exact name) and it's alright. If I remember correctly, it tasted VERY bland. Like no flavour whatsoever. 

I came here a second time and tried the Taro bubble tea and WHOA WHOA WHOA LORD WORST DECISION EVERRRRRRRR. Not only did it TASTE BAD, but it had like little taro bits in it and THAT MY MATIES WAS THE WORST PART. Like why?! WHY?! WHY HAVE YOU CHATIME PPL BURDENED ME LIKE SO?! WHY !! 

For my third visit which was yesterday, I decided to try the Grapefruit Blush. It looked absolutely beautiful in the picture, but the one they made for me wasn't beautiful at all. It came out so dark. How do you expect me to take nice iphone quality photos of it ?! :( Taste wise, it was just okay. When I took my first sip I almost choked to death because of how sweet it was. It was no different than someone whipping some sugar down your throat like WOOOWIE. I mixed and STIRRED IT BEFORE DRINKING IT but yeah it didn't help and clearly they pumped a lot of sweetness into it. As gross as it sounds, I added some water to dilute it and that made it much more enjoyable. BEGONE SUGAR PARTICLES YOU SHALL NOT TROUBLE ME ANY FURTHER 

Not really gonna come here again. I'll stick with my Tea Shop 168 and Coco (pmall should rly bring one coco store in i swear to god man)"}
{"text":"We visited chatime as we are fan of bubble tea, lots of variety - everyone can find something to drink with no disappointments. the quality of the drinks were beyond our expectations, the only downside is very small order counter so creates a jam while the ones who ordered before us are still waiting for their bubble tea, and the line up is in the staircase, they should have a bigger order counter and manage the line up differently, for the rest they should keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"Environment was good. The music was a mix of English and Asian songs. I got the lychee green tea with aloe vera, 50% sugar and less ice. I think that just became my favourite drink at chatime. Good to go there and do some work or just chill."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time today after hearing about it for years in Asia so am really glad its in Canada. I approve of the fact you can adjust the level of Ice and Sugar additives and I got their famous Cha time Milk tea with only 30% sugar and extra ice (it was HOT today so that extra ice is a must) and I like it so much better than the usual ones I get else where where its too sweet sometimes.

I will come back for sure! At least when am around this location am sure to purchase."}
{"text":"First stop on my \"Order the Yelp!\" list. At 9 pm the parking lot was crowded and the line up was to the door. Very busy and noisy place, most people were ordering to go. Looks like I'm in for a wait so I have a seat on their comfortable loooooong couch after placing my order. It actually took about 15 minutes to get in and out of that place, not too bad at all for efficiency. 

My Order: Mango Twist (added tapioca pearls for extra 50 cents) total $3 plus tax for a large.

Description: \"Infusing Chatimers' all-time favourite Taiwan Mango Juice into sweetened milky yogurt produces a wonderfully well-balanced fruity summer symphony - entrancing enough to keep you coming back for more\"

Expectation: I thought this would be a sweet, slightly thick drink

Reality: It was not thick at all. It was a combination of sweet and sour tastes which kinda grew on me. I'm glad I added the tapioca pearls because it added texture and sweetness to it. My drink was warm so I had to swirl my drink around a number of times so that the ice could cool it down.

Conclusion: If I'm in the area and in the mood for bubble tea AND they're running a special then I would be inclined to check out more of their menu. If you're a frequent customer they do have a rewards program."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and was somewhat surprised to see it not full! The drinks are relatively expensive and the teas aren't that much different.  Compared to the stores uptown, the price here are much higher (almost double, I'd say).  

I was in a mood for something hot, so I ordered a plain latte that was around $3.2.  What a disappointment! Tasted very watery and overly sweet. My friends each had a bubble tea, and they were also $4 + tax (way higher than the price of bubble tea I've seen)!  Was also fairly surprised to see how much ice they put into the teas (really dilutes it)...

The tv's here are also consistently looping on their own cheesy advertisements, so those definitely detract from the general atmosphere.  The place itself isn't that big, so it can get quite squished if full.

Likely won't be returning soon, not a good experience and definitely not worth the price and hype."}
{"text":"Great location for UofT students! :) Less busy than the Dundas store. I have been consistently impressed by their tea and service"}
{"text":"I thought I had good bubble tea in the past, I thought wrong. This is the most authentic bubble I've ever had in the city.

Get ready for a 10 minute wait, it's totally worth it. I normally get the honeydew melon signature milk tea with pearls, less ice, and 80% sweet. I love how you can customize your drink. There's so many options there's something here for everyone! I've also tried there taro signature milk and they're #1 seller \"Chatime milk tea\" also doesn't disappoint. Price is around $5 for a large, get a large you won't want this cup of b tea to end!

If you stop in for a bubble tea may I also recommend \"Kenzo Ramen\" next door, the only ramen spot in Mississauga. One word: Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, it's the only decent bubble tea in Mississauga and that's saying a lot given that Mississauga is the second largest city in Ontario!  

The last couple times has been disappointing once again with the very slow service, toppings like coconut jelly and tapioca running out. In the middle of the day. On a weekend.

If I ran an establishment and saw that popular additions with extremely high margin items were running low, I'd make a lot more right away instead of waiting for it to completely run out.  It's not that hard to anticipate this. And they sorely need a second cash register to be active!

I do not know if it is management not anticipating the need, or their student employees who don't care.  Perhaps a mature management presence is needed at this location because lately they are regressing back to the hugely disappointing opening period.

Come on ChaTime Mississauga, you can do so much better!"}
{"text":"We always go for their ice cream. The balloon and the barbe à papa are the best. I tried the cheesecake ice cream but was the least of my favorite. Huge quantity and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This location is okay.  There is one lady who always gets my order wrong, but most of the time the other staff members get it right.

Once they gave me and my friend the same wrong order because it was 7pm (nearing the end of the day) and I guess they didn't want to expend the energy to make two different drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to Chatime a number of times before, but it was my first time at this particular location.

It was pretty quiet when I came, which was a surprising departure from the usual crowds and hustle-bustle of the other Chatime locations I've visited. 

I ordered the pearl milk tea with added pudding. The tea itself was as expected and the pearls were fresh and abundant. However, they forgot to add the pudding! I was very disappointed at this - pudding was clearly indicated both on my receipt and on the drink label, and I didn't get what I paid for! (It was only 50 cents but still! I like my pudding!)

My sister got the matcha red bean milk tea, and she said that there was very little red bean. It's her go-to Chatime drink and she said that other locations usually add more.

Unfortunately, we got our drinks to-go and didn't taste them until we got into the car so we didn't have a chance to ask them to fix it.

Will probably not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Quick service (within 5 mins) - Went on Friday afternoon and got the chatime red bean MT for $4.50, $5.10 with tapioca and red bean topping after tax. 

Great spot for BT in Mississauga, cheaper than BR and TenRen in my opinion. Had to repeat a bit while ordering, staff may have a few issues with English. Overall very smooth!"}
{"text":"Wack wack wack.

I'm usually a fan of Chatime but this location is just bad. Ordered both the roasted milk tea and regular milk tea. Both tasted the same, that is, both tasted nothing like milk tea. They just tasted like milk. No roasted flavor. No tea flavor. The grass jelly had no flavor either. Totally unacceptable. If you must have Chatime, do yourself a favor and go to one of the many other locations in the area."}
{"text":"Chatime is a Taiwanese teahouse chain that is found all over the world.  The menu has a variety of fruit teas, milk teas, mousses, juices, smoothies, freshly-brewed teas, and coffee beverages.  There are also a variety of toppings, such as bubbles, jellies, etc.  I am absolutely in love with their Banana Milk Tea - it was the perfect amount of milkiness with a lovely taste of bananas - if you're a fan of those Korean banana drinks, you'll love this even more!  I just requested mine naked (without any toppings), with little ice, and 30% sweetness - it was a perfect amount of sweetness from the bananas while still tasting the freshly-brewed tea.  The hubs had the Passion Fruit Green Tea, and this was also pretty refreshing and tasty.  The employee in there was friendly and drinks were made efficiently, but with care.  The place has some tables in the back as well as one in the front and free wi-fi, so you can do some work, study, or just relax a bit before you go on your way.  Love this place!

+Banana Milk Tea :D :D :D
+freshly-brewed tea beverages

{"text":"It's okay. 

The bubble tea is pretty decent, like what you would get a PMall. 

The service though is definitely an area for improvement."}
{"text":"Only reason I went to this location to get bubble tea was because I had a free drink card. With so much other choices in the same mall, the price of bubble tea is on the higher scale. 

I came here on a Wednesday afternoon around 1 pm and it seems like they just opened for business. I was the only customer there at that time and it took them over 15 mins to make my drink.

I understand other Chatime locations take longer time, (but definately less than 15 mins ) because of the volume of customers but when I'm the only one there and it takes so long. It's VERY DISAPPOINTING!!

The drink itself was up to par and consistent like all other locations, nothing I can complain about that.

Chances of me going back to this location, extremely low, especially when there's so much other choices all around."}
{"text":"We have tried green milk tea with red bean and pearls.  Good flavor, and chewy pearls, but way too sweet.  Ask for reduced sugar if you prefer lighter version."}
{"text":"Come here with friends to talk to, a book to read, and a life problem to contemplate because you'll have had time to finish all of those things before you get your order.

Drinks are fine, but the slow service ruins the place. Not worth the time."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to it so it's really convenient to stop by especially on a hot summer day like this past week. Their tea drinks with aloe are always refreshing. I find their drinks in general a bit on the sweeter side, even at their minimal level of sugar. Their cakes are on the more expensive side but still tasty and different than other Chinese bakeries so it's nice for a change. Their service is not so great. It's slow. Also, what bugs me the most is that they have an accessibility sign on their main door with the automatic door button. It doesn't work. I started coming here more frequently while on mat leave since last winter. The door hasn't worked since this past winter, maybe even longer. I mentioned this to the staff and they said their manager knows but isn't doing anything about it. This is extremely disappointing and even discriminating to those who need to use the button to access the store."}
{"text":"You are always going to walk away with a pleasing cup of bubble tea from Chatime. I would recommend the following:
- Roasted milk tea with grass jelly at 30% sweetness
- Brown rice green milk tea

The only complaint about this location is that the service is SO SLOW and there is usually no convenient parking space available. For some reason, the employees here are really inefficient compared to the Chatime in downtown (at Dundas & Bay) and take forever to assemble the drink orders. I should also mention that this location is very inconvenient, being located next to Canada Computers. When people come to resolve their PC issues, they tend not to leave for hours on end, meaning the number of available parking spots are scarce. I usually end up parking in some obscure spot far away."}
{"text":"There are a few of these in Montreal and visited this one and the one in Chinatown.  Similar to bubble tea places in the US and you can customize your sugar level and ice amount.  I really liked the matcha green tea red bean drink.  The pearl milk tea and taro milk tea was pretty good but I've had better.  Service is kind of slow too but pretty good option for bubble tea."}
{"text":"Now, as someone who has grown up in a non-Asian community, bubble/green tea shops is not part of my life. In most Asian communities around Canada, green tea and bubble tea is sold regularly and drank religiously (maybe I'm exaggerating but the point still remains).  Personally, I've never heard of Chatime prior to my visit.

So, today I'm embracing my Chinese roots and decided to try Chatime. After indulging a tasty ramen noodle soup, I decided a sweet drink would finish my meal perfectly. 

This particular location is situated in strip mall, filled with Chinese restaurants and other Asian shops. The facade stood out as trendy and alive, distinguishing itself from the other shops. As I step through the threshold and into Chatime, the first thing I notice is the ambient vibe of the atmosphere. The decor was designed with a hip, modernized, teenage setting made for the 21st century.  A waitress, wearing an apron and glasses stood behind the counter, with two other waitresses already mixing drinks. The line ups were generally short. 

The menu was vast and wide in variety, consisting of green teas, healthy shakes and side toppings to top the drink off.  I order the lychee green tea, with no tapioca or any extra toppings.  I step off to the side into another line to pick up my drink.

The wait time was excruciatingly long. Line ups began to form behind me, as I patiently and eagerly waited for my drink. The waitresses, in a frenzied pace, hastily mixed and blended ingredients together into the delicious green tea. A waitress handed me my drink.

I left the shop with my drink and quietly sat in my car in silence. I stared directly at the cup that laid before my eyes. I raised my cup slowly, placing the straws slowly into my mouth and pressing my lips down slowly. I sip slowly, and swallowed the sweet liquid in my mouth. I started to grin heavily like a fool.

The sweet taste of lychee and strong flavors of green tea balanced perfectly. The drink was ice cold, giving me brain freeze that shook my entire body. I sipped the final drops in my cup, savoring every flavor. However, my only criticism was the drink was not mind- blowing, staying within the same chapters of its contemporaries.

Although Chatime is not perfect, nor anything special, the entire experience left a good first impression. Hence the reason why I will recommend you visit Chatime and get your Cha-Cha-Cha going (forgive my atrocious humor. I should stop :) ). I digress. If you visit, you might see me here purchasing another green tea.

[I have drank bubble tea and green tea in the past, but not frequently. Hence the reason why I wrote, \"nothing mind blowing.\"]"}
{"text":"Chatime Bloor is my absolute go-to location if I am ever craving Chatime! The interior is very modern and pleasant, and the service isn't very slow compared to the other locations. The line was quite lengthy, which isn't any surprise. It didn't take long for the workers to make the drinks and the washroom is never packed, which I find a good thing as I always have the urge to use the washroom a billion times. However, it was packed and there were absolutely no seats inside AND outside of the store. It was insane! I ordered the large Chatime Pearl Milk Tea with regular ice and sugar levels and it tasted good just like the usual. It is normally the drink I get if I can't decided what else to order. It's simple, basic, yet delicious and cheap! Tapioca is included in the drink already so you do not have to pay an extra $0.50 for that."}
{"text":"My brother in law is obsessed with Chatime. He lives next to Chatime in Toronto, he drinks it daily, he's crazy like that. So when he came back for the holidays, he was excited to find out that there's a Chatime in Montreal. The space is nice and clean, the service is great, their menu options are crazy. I like that you can customize your drinks, 30%, 80% sugar, ice, no ice etc. the matcha red bean, red bean and taro are awesome, their bubbles are yummy, not too sweet. A great franchise indeed."}
{"text":"Accessibility:  Not accessible friendly or stroller friendly 

Service:  I've been here a number of times (10+ times) over the summer and the service is lousy.  Never a 'thank you for your order', always over 30 minute or more for an order.

Bubble teas: I've had only had roasted milk and honey dew and chatime.  Their tapioca is excellent, but I find their sugar level for the tea is too much for me, so I normally order 50% or 80% sugar level.

Food/snack:  I've had the cronut.  Horrible!  Tasted old and there's no filling like a traditional cronut.  Waste of money. 

If you have the time to wait 30-40 for bubble tea, don't need an accessible entrance, and like getting late night bubble teas, then Chattime will be okay for you. 

Observations:  I've  always noticed that most people who come and order here do not stay and drink/eat.  Most people who occupy a table are just waiting for their order.  Their ordering, pull, production, delivery system needs to be revamped and optimized.  Why is the order station the same area as pick up when it's always crowded and backed up? 

I've now learnt my lesson...call ahead and order, but still be willing to wait in line for your order. There is no express take out option.  Do not bring the kids, especially if you have them in a stroller because getting in the door is next to impossible."}
{"text":"Much like the Dundas location -- but now, with new improvements!

Large outdoor patio facing Bloor!

No more monster line-ups in a cramped interior -- joint is open til midnight!

Actual room to sit and enjoy your drink!

Excitement!"}
{"text":"Told us they were out of tapioca. No mention of when they would have more. Twenty minutes later they had tapioca again, but we were leaving after having our tapioca-less drinks. 

What kind of bubble tea place doesn't have tapioca?!?"}
{"text":"This place is super busy. The line was right out the door, little space to wait around. Isn't the greatest spot for a large group to hang. It is more for grab and go with little seating area.

The staff were very friendly and calm, at ease with the traffic.

The drinks are delicious, I got my typical, Earl Grey Milk Tea, 30% Sugar, less ice.

My friend got the new Durian drink and she did not like it as much as she expected. It's only got a limited of time, until the 7th of April."}
{"text":"A solid 4/5! Finally got to visit this place a second time and no line up! 

This location is like asian central! You have the comic book store beside it and Kenzo Ramen, what more could you ask for! 

I ordered the Chatime pearls and my boyfriend got the grass jelly roasted milk tea. First off the service was fast, considering we waited 45 minutes before. I ordered my bbt with 30% sugar and less ice. It tasted perfect!! Just the right amount of sweetness! The grass jelly bbt my bf got was a little to sweet for me considering he got the standard order but I like the hint of roasted taste after every sip. The grass jelly was great, I would order that with a mixture of tapioca next time. I really enjoyed both orders since they're both flavourful and easy to drink, I'm not a big fan of slushy drinks. I believe those are the two most ordered bbt, and I would recommend them, they're hella good! I've always wanted to try something fruity but not sure which is good. 

I would come here again and I can't wait to try a fruitier option."}
{"text":"Had the Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea was very nice, I recommend having it with 50% sugar since the red beans are quite sweet. Staff were polite and didn't have to wait too long for my drink!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for bubbletea (especially for those that been to Asia $5 vs $1). But, the quality is significantly better than other places. I also like how I can customize the amount the ice and sugar in each drink. 

Recommended for the hardcore fans or for special occasions/discount events. Not recommended as a study spot as the tables are small and limited. In some ways, it is the Starbucks of bubbletea without the nice in store mood."}
{"text":"Had to wait for what seemed like centuries, but it was justified after taking a sip of my drink.

I think the most attractive component of this franchise is the the fact that they allow you to customize your drink. The interior of each store is an added bonus - super clean, bright and modern.

My addiction to bubble tea is getting a little out of hand - but I know I can rely on Chatime to cure me of my cravings."}
{"text":"Love this bubble tea place! There's two locations in Calgary - one in Brentwood and another in Chinatown. Really great drinks and service! Wish they were open earlier in the morning so I could get one before work haha 

I usually get their early grey milk tea - which any earl grey tea lover should try - but I have ventured out a few times and tried their jasmine milk tea and mango green tea! You can choose to have less sugar and less ice in the drinks so I usually get it half sugar and less ice. My friends love the roasted milk tea and the mango slush with lychee jelly as well! I don't think you can really go wrong here! 

Also I recently discovered the Chatime app where each dollar gets you a point and 50 points is a free regular drink! 400 points gets a gold membership so every 50 points after that gets you a free large drink! Its going to be a bittersweet moment when I get this gold membership knowing that I spent $400 here haha"}
{"text":"Everything they have are overly sweet, like sugar is free.....
And there is always a long long long line-up. 
Don't understand why people would have their bubble tea here instead of nos the...."}
{"text":"Order: Original bbt (wanted the salted foam bbt but they ran out)

Pros:
+ multiple locations globally speak to its international success and popularity 
+ huge variety of flavors 
+ strip mall parking

Cons:
- Long line ups. An hour long wait on a Monday evening?! You have got to be kidding me 
- this branch is not stocked to cater to demands. If there are such long line up a on A MONDAY, how are you not stocked to have the original drink I wanted? 
- they don't have much of a variety of bubble tea flavors with the savory milk foam option

I have been drinking chatime since the first location opened up in Toronto. Long lines are not uncommon, I've waited 20-30 minutes in the past. I was not at all impressed by this location. You're better off going to bubble republic in Mississauga (the town's staple bubble tea hot spot)."}
{"text":"Out of the million bubble tea vendors in pmall, this is one of the better bubble tea places. They have more variety and more \"customizable\" options. You can choose your level of sweetness, can have the drink hot or cold along with the standard options (jelly or bubbles etc).

Like a lot of vendors in there, there's always a bit of a line up and the prices are quite pricey, more so than its competitors in there (all bubble tea places in there are already quite expensive I find). I actually find their wait times longer than their competitors, or even their other locations. 

They do collect points so if you don't have a points card yet, best to sign up at the cashier. If you forget to bring your card, you can give them your phone number to collect the points.

If you're in pmall and am looking for a decent bubble tea place, probably try Presotea instead (they have buy 1 get 1 free promos). This place is great but given the wait times and the prices, you do have better options."}
{"text":"I love Chatime. But this location is consistently not great. It's so close to work... but I would rather brave traffic on Highway 7 and go to the Commerce Valley location than come here. Or maybe the downtown markham location? Their drinks always taste watery somehow and not as smooth as other locations. Tapioca isn't the greatest either - could be cooked more. 

It's a Bake Code as well which I've written a previous review for. Just go to the North York location."}
{"text":"In Mississauga Chatime is one of the heavy hitters when it comes to the Bubble Tea/Milk Tea game. I really like their selection of drinks, even though it's kinda small I feel it's concise. Service isn't that great but I don't really care nor expect stellar service from places like this. 

If you're looking for a place to sit down and chat, this place ironically isn't the place to go. It's very loud and can be uncomfortable. 

When I go I usually have the Pearl Milk Tea. From there you have the option of adding any extra things in there (Pudding, Jelly etc). Furthermore you can change the level of sweetness and ice; personally I leave everything the way it is. 

If you're looking for a place for Bubble Tea or Milk Tea, check them out!"}
{"text":"Love the baked goods - they are pricey so can't get it all the time. Cakes are amazing too!! Maybe because cashiers need to take drink orders and pack baked goods, I find this location to be much slower than other chatimes. They should keep a separate line for ppl who want to order drinks only. Most staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Another chatime and bake code location to the growing number of chatime locations within the GTA. 

Located right in the plaza at the intersection of Woodbine and 16th Ave where the TNT plaza is. It's located further back nearby the One's and All star wings. 

Just recently opened just last week on December 12-14. The newly just opened Chatime and Bakecode contains fresh in house baked Taiwanese buns, breads, and deserts. Also to go along are all the chatime drinks where most locations contain similar types of drinks. 

Interior decor is very nice with new modern sliding design for when you choose your buns. Most drink selection are the same at all other locations. 

Unfortunately the most common problem /downfall that occurs at every new Chatime/Bakecode that opens is there speed and efficiency of operation. Staff are understaffed and seems to be not trained or ready for moderate to high traffic flow of customers yet. Went during a non peak time and there were at most only 4 other people inside. And took over 20 mins to gather all the items bought and get out. That's way too long. 

This location needs more efficient staff to work and gather a working system to manage their customers in a better timely matter to satisfy their customers imo. Sadly would of thought they got a handle on this since they have opened so many locations already...."}
{"text":"Bought a red bean milk tea. Just happened to see opening day signs so I stopped in. Nice, clean and friendly. I'm not a frequent purchaser of bubble tea so I can't really compare it. I got less sugar and less ice options and it was perfect. Not overly sweet like a lot of other places. I'd come back, just hate this parking lot - bring your winter beater if you care about your car."}
{"text":"Chatime is quickly becoming very popular spot for people who indulge in the artful drink called bubble tea or boba tea. For those that are not so sure what this is check out the description on Wikipedia. Bubble Tea for Asians is a kind of dessert refreshment or similar to Starbucks (except this is tea not coffee and most drinks are cold) where people come for their refreshment of choice.  I've had Chatime in Toronto and I'd concur it's the most consistently excellent boba you can find at a reasonable price.  Also you can customize the level of sugar and ice which is awesome!  Selection is huge and you can go for regular size (around 450ml) or large size (700 ml).    

On my visit I went for a L Pearl Milk tea 80% sugar 80% ice with bubbles.  It was just perfect to my liking. creamy with some nice chewiness of the bubbles. 

Lineups here on my visit was not as long as it is in Toronto (where it's ridiculous) and the place has free wifi and tables for people to lounge and enjoy their BT. 

The place is packed with students (my guess Concordia and Mcgill) enjoying their teas.  If I lived closer to here I'd here here weekly to every other week. 

I noticed they do deliver if you have more than 5 drinks within 3.5KM radius.  Pretty cool if you are lazy and/or having friends over."}
{"text":"Wow Chatime is just popping up everywhere. Wandering around Montreal and wanted some bubble tea so decided to get some at Chatime. There was a long wait in front of me and then a few minutes in a long line after me as well. Took about 10-15 minutes to complete the order. Always get the original with tapioca. The tapioca here were tasteless and not sweetened which was disappointing. But it was still perfectly chewy. The milk tea is good. Location was also perfect, right by Metro station Guy Concordia. I'm glad there's good bubble tea joint here just wish the line wasn't so long and tapioca would be sweetened."}
{"text":"Last night I tried to redeem my 10 points for a regular size Taro milk tea with tapioca. They told me that I need to pay 50 cent extra for the topping. I explained to them that their website clearly stated that to redeem 10 points you can get one free regular sized drink with one complimentary topping. But they would not listen to me. I ended up getting the regular pearl milk because they do not accept debit under $3. Today I went to chatime the one located on Dundus. And I spoke to the manager and he told me they made a mistake. Next time If you want to go to chatime then go to the one near Dundas and Bay.  Please avoid this location because they do not know what the heck they are doing."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Chatime since their 1st Toronto location opened, but I stopped going because of the perpetual line up and lack of seating at the Bay/Dundas location. This location, as others have already mentioned, is much quieter and more relaxing. I can always get a table and it's never that crowded, so you can feel free to stay and chat with friends or read/study. 

My go to is the Caramel Milk Tea with tapioca - so good!! Quality of the tea and tapioca has been consistently good, and I find the service to be efficient and friendly. You can adjust the amount of ice and sweetness in your drink. As it warms up, their seating increases as they have a pretty big patio facing out to Bloor St."}
{"text":"Love the bbtea and the kitchen is amazing but the place in general is poor. The tables were dirty and messy, the floor is sticky, the walls look old and mold. But on the good side theres plugs to charge phones."}
{"text":"You can choose no ice and your sweetness level. I chose a grass jelly milk tea, was yummy! However, they did not charge the person after me tax but my order was to go..... Hmmm..... I wonder y..lol"}
{"text":"When in Rome, do as the Romans do, visit Chatime five consecutive days, and drink their Grapefruit and green tea.  It is refreshing and delicious!  Chatime offer a variety of tea and smoothie options. See my picture.  The long line at Chatime is evident that the teas are delicious. If you didn't plan to visit Chatime as I did for five consecutive days, then it is a must do in Montreal.  Also, ask for a frequent buyers card, and you will get a free drink after a number of purchases.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Consistently good at every Chatime. This Chatime is super busy with lots of students here. Its located near the University of Calgary and lots of students come here. Parking is available in front.

This Chatime is so far the biggest Chatime I have seen. The place has two floors. It offers food options here and not just drinks.

I got the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. So far awesome drinks."}
{"text":"This particular location was pretty chaotic on a late Saturday night. 

The store itself is a decent size with a couple of tables but the shop itself is a bit narrow, so when there's a big lineup of people waiting to order, it can get a bit claustrophobic. 

The restaurant itself is clean, but the staff are not the most efficient unfortunately.  I ordered on standard pearl milk and I was waiting almost 10 minutes. 

Overall, its a decent location, just with slow service.

Parking is also a bit tight in this plaza."}
{"text":"Chatime is one of those few bubble tea chain stores in Montreal that has a variety of milk tea, smoothies and whatnot. The place is pretty cozy, although fairly small so bringing a huge group of friends to hang out may be a problem. Only problem is that their drinks can be very inconsistent (from bland to overly sweet) and honestly, I can just go to Nos Thes for better drinks which is on the other corner of the street. Gave an extra star cus of decent service"}
{"text":"Come on a Friday night with a large group, found a table immediately but the store filled up very soon after that. Wait times are much better than the enterprise location.
Bbt tasted on par, but I generally don't like the slim selection at Chatime that actually taste good. Aside from their couple of star drinks, everything else seems like a gamble.
I was impressed how one barista saw a junior not fill up to the rim, quickly caught and corrected that, brownie points right there.
Otherwise, nothing special to write home about."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and find that the service is quite slow..more recently, I came on a Sunday afternoon and there was no lineup to order, the girl who took my order was very polite..but when I got in line to wait for my drink, there was a backup of at least 15 drinks before mine.

How did they get so behind on the drinks? I'm not sure. I ended up having to wait over 15 minutes for my drink, Roasted Milk Tea,..which I found to have a very weak tea taste and strong milk/creamer compared to usual.

There is a considerable amount of seating and I have never seen this place full, so finding a table should not be an issue."}
{"text":"I enjoy the tea and the atmosphere, but they need to more to keep the place clean. I am not a neat freak, but the corners and floors have filth and old spills from a long while back. I can barely see into the cafe from outside, since windows are very dust covered. Makes it less appealing to go inside, especially in the summer.
Seems like plenty of staff behind the counter, but none on cleaning duty.
Might be back to try the food menu if they clean up their act."}
{"text":"On my trip to Montreal, this bubble tea shop has made it to the top of my list for bubble tea and a large memory for my trip(my mother I have both found an addiction for bubble tea, so we try many bubble tea places everywhere we go). They have tons great things that have attracted me to them. First off, their variety of flavors of teas and their variety of toppings are more than I've ever seen before. My mother purchased the jasmine milk tea with boba and I purchased the Thai milk tea with boba(I got that flavor 4 times in a week). The flavor was outstanding and the boba had a perfect texture. The employees were extremely kind and patient with orders. Everything about chatime impressed me, from the quality of their drink to the style of their shop. Their shop is extremely modern with plenty of seats for teenagers to sit and mingle. A fantastic place for me to keep in mind for next time
I visit. The only downside? They don't have enough shops in New York."}
{"text":"I've been here tons of times it's next to my favourite Ramen place Kenzo in Mississauga. I always get a Strawberry bubble milk tea with no tapioca and light ice. Make sure you ask for light ice because if you get it with regular ice they just load up the drink with ice which leads to a bad drink to ice ratio.

I've had strawberry bubble tea from other tea shops and this one is one of the better ones. They take a while to make the bubble tea and sometimes its so busy the line goes out the door. There are off times to go when its not busy. 

Its a nice treat every once in a while,but its over priced for what you get and I thinks its a little too sweet to have often. 

The vicinity points they have is a plus because its one points card and it works at  a bunch of places so I prefer it to mutiple points cards"}
{"text":"So far nothing special. The lineup and busyness of this place is crazy to not have lots of tables or any waitresses. It's pretty much ONLY takeout. On top of that, I got a simple tea, and the must have messed it up a couple of times since I was customer 150 but I heard them call 151 152 153 154 155 156 and then finally mine came out with an apology. The tea was good though, as expected, and their options for REAL tea is actually impressive. I will have to go back again to give it a more fair review. The part that really bugged me though, is they try to be modern with ice and sugar amount options (for whatever reason), but don't have soy milk, or other milk options like some other \"modern\" bubble tea places. It's really not that hard or expensive to add that as an option...and it would justify the sugar and ice options at least."}
{"text":"Just an update as a spent a few hours there, enjoying my drink inside this new tea house, and have more information:

1.  Who knew there were soo many Asian youths in 'ssauga?  This city is turning into Markham/Richmond Hill!

2.  If the line is out the door, expect to wait approx. 30-35mins.  Then approx. 10 more minutes for your order.  The past coupla nights I've driven by, there has ALWAYS been a line outside!

3.  This place is LOUD.  Not BR loud, but let's just say that this probably isn't the place to bring your laptop, use their free wifi, and get some studying/work done.  You could have a conversation, but background music is blasting, and other people's convos are pretty distracting. 

4.  I believe they have free wifi, but it is password protected.  I didn't bother to ask for their p/w.

5.  If you decide to enjoy your drink inside, they will still give you a disposable cup.  Not sure that I like the idea of unnecessary, added waste.

6.  Flavour of tea could be a bit stronger.  (I mean you are paying $5 for a regular...which is like an expensive Starbucks!)  I had a warm Jasmine green milk tea last night and I was barely able to taste the Jasmine.

7.  Closes at 12AM. 

My people DON'T sleep!!!"}
{"text":"Solid bubble tea place. 

Their menu is so expansive it's always awkward standing there reading the whole thing while the person taking your order politely waits haha. They're always quick to give suggestions and help out thank goodness. 

If you're a rookie like me try the Honey Green tea with coconut jelly. it was the latest combo and my favourite so far.

It's important to note that chatime is GREAT for the winter too. You'd think that it's a summer time beverage place but on man their warm tea is just as fantastic! I would strongly recommend the same Honey Green tea with tapioca! You might be confused that they give you a straw but that's okay. Have no fear the tea is the right temperature to drink with a straw!"}
{"text":"I just had a craving for bubble tea between work and my study group so decided to stop here and be a bit productive. 

I used to be a really big fan of bbtea until I got older and realized how much sugar there were in it.. 

I like how Chatime let you customize your drinks (i take mine iwth 30% of ice and 30% sugar). I love their mango special one and the matcha one !! Taro was OK.

It's 6$ for a large one, music is some asian pop playing.
Free WiFi.
It's Montreal downtown so yeah, walk and take the metro, don't go by car ! 
They take credit card."}
{"text":"So many options yet nothing with caffeine free? And no dairy free options? To this day and age, we need gluten free, dairy free and vegan options. Interior needs to be decorated better as ambiance/atmosphere is not that inviting. I don't feel like hanging out there."}
{"text":"Second tier compared to Bubble Republic. Overrated tbh :("}
{"text":"Serves good bbt but has unprofessional staff, bartenders are messy, washrooms dirty and not handicap friendly.  This seems to be their business model as of late."}
{"text":"This chatime has a bakery and its close to the schools so it should have great business which it does but because of this and the size of the store, there are only 2 registers. So the line to purchase your bubble tea is long unless you get here on the off hours. I have recently tried the bakery and i have got to say that its not that great. Marketed at a high price but tastes average. Especially their tart which is expensive for a tart but also disgusting in taste. 
The bubble tea otherwise is the same as other chatime stores."}
{"text":"Parking can be a headache but consistently delicious bubble tea. Chatime is a cut above most bubble tea places and so far has kept their prices reasonable compared to others."}
{"text":"I love bbt and I like chatime. I hate this location. Bubble tea is butter tea. It's not hard to mess it up because there are instructions and ingredients for bubble teas. 

The customer service at the place is ridiculous. They're so rude. Walked in yesterday and was slapped with a 
\"What do you want?\"

\"Oh, umm hi. Can I please get (insert drink here) 
\"That's xyz amounts of money.\" 

So I proceeded to pay all the while getting dirty looks from the cash employee as he stands drinking his bbt in front of customers hand on waist. 

Then gives me the death stank face for not tipping. Sorry sir, but how am I suppose to tip you for your shiaty service. Explain. 
I want to say this is the first time it's happened to me at this location, but it's not. I'll take my pocket change elsewhere."}
{"text":"I frequent this place as a Uoft student. Things are pretty standard. Drinks come out with consistency, but the servers and the cashiers especially often have a bad attitude. I just went there today and the woman in the fake denim shirt operating the cash register snatched the money from my hands with an unnecessary amount of force and a grimace on her face... and then dropped all my change in my hand like she didn't care where the coins landed. I don't really care, but really, does it hurt to smile?"}
{"text":"Drinks are good but super long wait time. There are lots of people working but nothing is fast. Customers waiting looked very frustrated."}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 3/5
I come to this Chatime location 3-5 times a week, primarily in the evenings. One of the best bubble tea places in the area in terms of flavours and variety. However service is a huge issue at this location, as the staff are very slow and inefficient.

Food/Drink: 4/5
Menu has a large variety of different drinks, all of which taste very good. There are numerous green teas, milk teas and slushes. For those trying Chatime for the first time, they allow you to choose your sugar and ice levels.

Service: 2/5
Service is a huge issue at this location, especially in the evenings and during moderately high traffic. Some of the staff are friendly, however in general the staff are slow and inefficient. Expected wait times in the evening are around 15 minutes on average, I once waited 1-hour. You can also always expect them to be out of some product, whether its a specific flavour or tapioca pearls. After 10pm, they don't serve slushes or blended beverages.

Atmosphere: 3/5
Atmosphere is quite lively, with upbeat music playing throughout the store. Its a common spot for groups of friends and family to hangout, some people sit and play cards and boardgames. Cleanliness is average.

Tips & Recommendations:
-Roasted Milk Tea, Peach Green Tea and Mango Slush are highly recommended
-Parking is quite limited, as it shares a small parking lot with various other businesses
-UberEATS not supported anymore at this location
-Lunch Break Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"Perfect to go with friends, alone or with a date! Honestly i go there almost everyday!  The staff is so nice and eventually remembers my order because i always take the same haha~ on their 2years aniversary they gave some free drinks and merchandise such as reusable cups wich i use all the time and when i bring it to the store the other custumers are super jealous!"}
{"text":"Chatime's tea is decent, but still no avocado.  They told me they had no gift cards, but you could get them at their downtown shop.  Headed down there and surprise - no gift cards to be had."}
{"text":"I have been here before many times and I do love the flavour and quality of there bubble tea and tapioca. 

I would like to think I'm the ultimate taro slush queen and the advocate mango slush expert and only recently with in the last 2 years have I ventured outside of the taro slush and mango slush. 

Chatime is definitely a top three bubble tea joint of choice. Again the freshness and quality of their bubble tea is great :) 

My biggest turn offs however is the last two times I have been their machine for slushies has been broken as the waits are long. Other than that I'm good :)"}
{"text":"Review: drinks and snacks.

I've been craving for some fried chicken \"pie\" ever since I came back from Taiwan and when I found out that Chatime was offering the exact same thing, I had to make a trip out to try it.

Bottomline: Solid BBT and good food. Not a lot of tables for dining in. Busy with students.

Atmosphere: located a stone's throw away from the Brentwood station, place is situated below a high rise apartment complex. Due to its location, place is constantly packed with students. Decor is nice for a BBT cafe and place is spacy. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of tables to nest in. Service was friendly and fast.

Food: I ordered the Chatime roasted milk tea with bubbles and the fried chicken xl. Drink was solid with a nice aromatic roasted tea flavor and the bubbles were cooked well. The fried chicken xl was a flattened piece of boneless chicken seasoned with Taiwanese spice. For Calgary, it was well seasoned, juicy, and tasted great. However, it pales in comparison to the same chicken you get in Taiwan. The first bit of the chicken in Taiwan was an explosion of flavor in your mouth. It did not happen with the chicken here.

Value: price for the BBT was average at best, food was on the steeper side. The chicken was 8 dollars with portion size meant for a snack."}
{"text":"Best BBT in town!!! Real fruits and stuff."}
{"text":"Very under-trained. I asked if I can use my points for a free drink, said I did not bring my card and no. I lost my card but have phone connected to my account, said I have to pay for a new card, which I checked online later saying phone is fine and I can get a new card at any store. Also, I ordered a hot drink, gave me a drink full of ice. I am waiting to see when it will close."}
{"text":"The ginger snap milk tea was pretty good and ginger-snappy; loved it!  The maple milk tea on the other hand just sucked big time; the maple flavor was soooooooooo subtle like almost missing and the pudding topping was way too thin.  The tapioca pearl was kinda tough and too chewy.  One word, disappointing."}
{"text":"the drinks are chatime quality, which means it's better than most bubble tea places in toronto. the service here is a bit sucks though."}
{"text":"My taro bubble tea was all powder so I couldn't drink any of it. It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Consistent in quality all the other chatime locations~! Super convenient for all uoft students :D"}
{"text":"Went with the Taiwan Mango QQ and it was one of the best bubble tea I've had.

They get kinda busy but they work very efficiently. Tea is prepped perfectly. Love the plastic cover and having my straw pierce it.

Pricing is a bit high but it's totally worth it. Very fresh. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Never have coconut jelly also they don't let you substitute for other toppings even though it is their fault also be careful seems like points card reader does not function have to always ask / keep track of my points horrible service !"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out their most popular cake when I saw it on instagram so I was soooo disappointed figuring out that they don't have it in this location!

But I still ended up purchasing two croissants and two bbt loll except that my experience was pretty good..staff were nice their service was good

I'd really recommend trying their croissants! Especially the taro one :))"}
{"text":"I'm probably very biased towards Chatime, but this location was not on par with other Chatime's I've had. 

In Montreal I would say the St. Catherine location is a bit better and more authentic flavours. This location tasted off to me when I ordered the regular pearl milk tea.

It was less creamy than other places, and the tapioca wasn't as chewy here. Still it's much better than contending bubble tea shops in the area. 

Also, this location has limited seating and a more run down ambiance compared to the st. Catherine location which has ample seating. This location also closes at 10:30 PM everyday and sometimes even earlier (on a Wednesday it was closed at 9:45 though the neon sign in the window says it's hours are open until 10:30 everyday). 

Perhaps I am just biased towards Ontario Chatime's, but this place could be improved a bit. I'll be back though because it definitely satisfies my Chatime cravings."}
{"text":"Today  I  had a  craving  for  bubble  tea. Soo... decided  to try  out  a  new  place!  Checking
the  places  on  yelp  and  found chatime.  This  little  place  is  great !  The  buble  tea's my boyfriend  and  i took  tasted  awsome.  The  only  off  side  was that  we  waited  a  little  while  since  this  place  seems  very  popular  and  parking  is  really  hard to  find.  Over all  very  nice  place."}
{"text":"When I found out there was a chatime FINALLY opening up north in Markham...(well, more north)...I was very happily excited. I am an extreme chatime fan....coco what?

This chatime is opened along with bake code. So instead of the usual purple theme in most chatime places, this store is decorated with wooden walls, wooden displays (for the buns)--I really like it!

I ordered a hot taro milk tea during their buy 1 get 1 free promo. The drink itself was decent but when I compare it to other locations I feel it is missing that \"taro\" flavour; that \"one thing\" that takes it to another level (you know??). I also took a sip of the roasted milk tea w/ grass jelly and it was also missing a bit of that intense roasted tea taste that I love. Grass jelly was decent...not too hard nor slimy. 

I found the cashier to be quite rude. Now, I know this isn't a fancy restaurant and so I shouldn't expect much service, but when I asked about their BOGO deal and if it was ANY drink (PSA: it's not...and their email did NOT state you're limited to 3 drinks), she was very annoyed and even rolled her eyes at me. Ouch. I never had rudeness problems in other chatime locations. 

Lastly, considering this is a chatime + bakecode store...their selection of bread/buns was not very extensive but very exPensive. Also a lot of their displays were empty, though the reason for that may be because they are still new.

Anyways, because of the missing \"flavours\" of their drinks, rudeness from that one cashier, and lack of selection for a bun store, I didn't think this chatime deserved any more than 3 stars compared to the Warden/Gibson location which still remains my favourite for its consistency. I will be coming back for the love of chatime...but until the lines die down I'll head over to Warden."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... the drinks are kinda good.  The location is a bit of a different story.  Come with lots of patience.  Even if you're at the front of the line, they may take 7 minutes to get to you.  Really.

Right by UofT and ROM, you have ChaTime in the perfect location except  right now it's under a mess of scaffolding.  It's open but its so hard to see where it is from the street right now.  Just look for a flash of purple signage and you're there.  The store has done one thing well... it's put the line direct from the door up the side to the ordering spot.  It's not crowded into the front or spilling into the seating area.  The seating area has a number of tables but I'm going to be honest, it's a bit of a mess.  It's clear the UofT students love this spot because you can see so many just take up entire tables themselves while studying or it's a mess of old napkins.  This is definitely an university hang out spot.

As for service, it's 'interesting'.  I got here before the crowd and I just saw the line up from just me to at least 12 people behind me.  The problem... something was amiss with the previous order and they needed 2 people to fix it for at least 7 minutes.  Seeing how I was at the front, it was a bit annoying to wait for so long but I would REALLY hate it if I was the 12th person at the end.

Mango Juice QQ - to call this juice would be wrong.  Mango fruit drink ... that's probably right.  It's a light clear orange sip that's pleasant and not too sweet when you ask for 50% sugar.  The QQ part is really the two types of chewy toppings.  Their regular boba and then the coconut jelly.  One thing weird about the jelly... they're length is wider than the straw so it often clogs the straw.  I ended the drink with almost all the coconut jelly still in the drink.  Boba was nice and chewy and not over cooked.  I'd order this again but just with boba only.  3.5/5

Coffee Smoothie - this one was ok ... I feel like they forgot to get all the ice blended cause every sips had these chunks in it.  Flavour wise it wasn't bad but I think it wasn't flavourful as it needed to be.  3.5/5

Lesson learned here ... if there's a line up, keep walking and go somewhere else.  Even if there's no line, it's debatable to recommend this spot and maybe you should keep walking too."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... its actually good for Mississauga but I felt this particular location was chaotic with the parking and it's a bit slow.

Chatime is another international big brand for bubble tea that landed in the GTA.  I knew of Chatime when it first went into the GTA East and I've seen it a few times in busy spots like Square One.  I totally forgot it was in Mississauga until my yelp search had it pop up.  This location is just ... crazy.  It's a strip mall off the super busy intersection of Mavis and Burnhampthorpe.  Even on a late afternoon before the after dinner rush, the parking lot was completely filled and there was a constant rush of cars coming in and out.  

The store itself is one of the larger spots I've seen... there's at least 10 tables where you can sit after ordering.  The decor is the brand standard of white walls, light wooden touches, and the bold purple as being the key colour.  The ordering area was busy with a few people... maybe 2 people in the line up before us.  There was a decent amount of staff. I spied at least 5 different people.  Service here is not quite efficient.  For that many staff, I would hope teas would be made quicker than waiting around for 10 minutes.  Even the people before us with an order of one tea... still at least 10 minutes.

One thing I did think was cute... they've got a promo right now.  For an order of 2 drinks, you get a lucky 'purple' pocket with different prizes.  We got the basics of buy one get the second for $0.88.  It's a nice touch for the upcoming Chinese New Year.

Chatime milk tea (hot) - I've had a few hot milk teas from the past few brands.  I felt this one was a bit more diluted than the other stores out there.  Though I got this half sweet, it was still a kick of sugar with a lighter black tea flavour.  I like if it had more of a robust black tea so this one was good but not great.  3.5/5

Coffee Slushie - Another decent drink but I found here the flavour wasn't as good as others spots in the GTA West.  A touch too light on the coffee flavour.  At 30% sweetness, this was one of the more balanced drinks.  I know this is a slushie so you have to use ice to make it a slush but I found this was a lot of iced used.  I felt they just overloaded it with possibly too much ice... after finishing off the drink, there was ice slush half the cup size left in it. 3.5/5

Chatime milk tea with boba - Similar to the hot chatime milk tea, its a pretty decent tea with a lighter flavour.  I think there was a good amount of bubbles given and if anything, I probably finished the drink before the bubbles.  The bubbles was actually nicely cooked... chewy and touch sweet.   3.5/5

Brown Sugar milk tea - I honestly couldnt tell that much of a difference from the chatime milk tea.  I felt this one was just maybe a touch more of a caramel flavour that the regular chatime milk tea.  Similar to the others... definitely lacking on the good tea note.  It was good but could be better.  3.5/5

Overall, its a decent spot but only during the slow times... I cannot imagine trying to get in and out of this place (and the store) when it's dinner time or right after dinner. It would be a crazy nightmare and the wait for parking and your drink would be crazy."}
{"text":"one of the bigger chatime locations (big and pretty!!), got the wintermelon here and wasn't bad at all. i still would choose the wintermelon from gong cha though. line moved pretty quick around 8:30 pm on a saturday night. same experience as every other cha time i've been to..... so yeah ...... one thing you should do is make sure they repeat your order back to you because they did mess up on my cousins drink"}
{"text":"I guess they misjudged the quantity when mixing. They filled the difference with.....yes TAP WATER

NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"The line is always crazy! I like to get the grapefruit juice w/ rainbow jelly. It's so refreshing. Sometimes if I see the line is too crazy, I won't bother just for a drink. 

I notice that they have doughnuts randomly but no one seems to busy them. I also recall seeing a pattern of notes saying \"sold out\" on popular items. Overall good drinks here."}
{"text":"Conveniently located inside pmall, this Chatime beats all other bubble teas in the mall. It's definitely not the cheapest one of all but it's worth the extra few bucks. My favourite is the Taro Milk Tea with tapioca (30% sugar and more ice). Compared to other Chatimes, this one is less busy. But for some reason a lot slower."}
{"text":"Came for the drink which was up to par. This one has the bakery as well which is really cool but a Damn expensive bakery. To be fair $5 doesn't make much sense either, but we're used to it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to Chatime only a weekly basis... You can say we're addicted! Our drinks always taste to par and can't complain! I once dropped my drink and they even made me a new one! Waits are sometimes long but we don't mind! They seem to always be quite busy. 

Only complaint is their donuts! They are DISGUSTING! As a VIP member, whenever I redeem a free drink, you also get a free donut... I don't even know why I bother taking them because I take one bite and throw out the rest. Do NOT spend your money on their nasty donuts!"}
{"text":"I had a roasted milk tea with pearls. I am new to this. It is not the best for a drink. However it was refreshing!!!"}
{"text":"This is a review for mostly the service, but the drinks are still not up to the standards of what you'd expect from such a well known franchise. It's popular in Montreal mostly because it's the only place to get a quick bubble tea. The cashier lady is rude and her attitude just makes me never want to spend 5 bucks on their drink ever again. First of all i asked for 1/3 sugar, and she rudely told me \"no we don't do that only 20th\", to which i said fine. Even though i found it odd since all Taiwanese chain stores do 1/3, 1/2, 4/5, and 5/5 sugar. I know because I've lived in Taiwan most of my life and I've asked for the same drink at almost all bubble tea stores in Canada and USA. When I received my drink it wasn't 1/5 sugar instead it was 120% sugar! I went to the guy making the drink to notify that they made a mistake and their first reaction was...\"it's not our fault you must have done something wrong.\" I told them I asked the lady first for 1/3, but she said they didn't have that only 1/5. She heard me and she retorted \"I did not tell you that, i said 120th and we only do 1/3 sugar not 1/5\". Um...if i wanted 1/3 and not full sugar why the hell would i want 120% sugar. 

anyways i was just not pleased with the experience and will never go back to purchase overpriced bubble tea again."}
{"text":"Chatime has been our go-to bubble tea spot since  it has opened in Mississauga. They  provide a wide variety of bubble tea flavours and toppings that all taste so good. Their bubble tea is prepared fairly quick as well! However there are multiple kinks in their store and service. The spacing and seating of the place is horribly tight and somewhat congested even when it's not busy. In addition to multiple visits where particular drinks (slush majority of the time) and even debit/visa machines are not available! Our constant visits are only due to their great tasting bubble teas, however their service and ordering operations could use more work."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the other Chatime locations across the GTA many times and for the most part, the experience has been consistent and worth it.  Yes, the lineups can be legendary but hey, you're either there with a friend or your smartphone so lineups can be bearable now.   

The issue with this Chatime is their roasted milk tea is lacking the roasted flavour that you've come to expect after visiting the other locations.  I've been to this location now 4 times since it's opened and each subsequent visit leaves me less and less confident it was a one-off situation.

The other issue is their early closing time on weekends for a bbt shop.  They close at midnight - which isn't too bad but the crowd that goes out for bbt on weekends, I bet the majority of them want to stay out later than midnight.  If your other locations can close at 2 am, why can't this one?  Hopefully this is something they'll look into and change in the near future."}
{"text":"My favourite bubble tea place in Mississauga.  My favourite drink is the QQ Taiwan Mango Juice and the Roasted Rice Milk Tea w/ Grass Jelly.  I come here pretty often, and the quality of drinks has always been up to standards, and are very consistent.  I like the drinks here better than other places because they taste more natural and less powder-based.  Also, there are a variety of options you can choose to adjust your drinks further to your liking (sugar, ice, etc.).  Overall, this is a bubble tea place that gets bubble tea right!   

Staff don't seem as friendly as other places I've been to but they get the job done nevertheless.  However, the environment is great for chilling with friends or perhaps getting some work done.  They do get very busy at times, and there's a certain hype about this place but it definitely lives up to the hype.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good service. Very tasty milk teas from a Chinese perspective. Not too sweet. Very good service too."}
{"text":"Very small stall situated in the mall. I did not find any problems with my order, there was a really long line and everyone tried their best which I appreciated. I got their classic pearl milk tea and flavor was strong like at any other Chatime locations."}
{"text":"Sometimes there's no line, sometimes there are lines. I've been here numerous times, always got the same drink, #1. The consistency is the same, they make it just right! Good place for groups of friends and I did see a lot of students there just studying. I always go here when I'm in the area.

One of the best Chatime locations!"}
{"text":"The place is great for studying, because of the comfy chairs, plugs, free wifi, but that's about it. I'm not a fan of their bubble teas. For some reason their bubble tea tastes odd to me. I realized every time I ask for a reduced sugar bubble tea, such as Lychee tea with tapioca, it tastes like a sugary syrup with loads of chemicals, which probably is exactly what gives the \"flavour\". Maybe it's just me, but I'm sure I've tried good bubble tea elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hands down... The thing I order everytime.... Roasted brown rice milk tea with grass jelly with less ice."}
{"text":"The milk tea with tapioca and taro with tapioca are both really yummy drinks! :) It's our first time at this Chatime location - there is spacious seating and free wifi, great for catching with with friends or studying. However, the girl staff at the back is quite loud and seems to be talking loudly as if the customers can't hear her. Also, the bathrooms also seem quite dirty - no hand soap, toilet paper on the sink instead of in the holder."}

This one is nice in terms of seating area, and the quality is consistent. Great place to stop by after eating out in k-town. 
I usually order the caramel milk tea or a mango green tea, depending on how filling I want my drink to be. Mmm."}
{"text":"First time going here, no one was in the store except us and we waited for 10 minutes only to get the wrong order then another 10 minutes to get it right. The taro smoothie has a weird texture and the mango slush tastes more like a guava slush. Utterly disappointed"}
{"text":"Just like any other chatime but management needs to hire more staff for the weekend. The line up is always ridiculously long."}
{"text":"I had been here for a few times during off peak hours so never have much issue with slow service. Drinks I ordered were OK as I usually order their popular ones that the staff had made hundred times or more already.

I kind of like how it has Bake Code on site as I can grab a treat to go with my drinks.

Parking never a issue as there always plenty of parking during off hours. Commerce Gate location always been more a challenge for me."}
{"text":"Simply good stuff. Students get 10 percents discount."}
{"text":"Mmm ok so here in the pic is what I got. I haven't had my fill of Chatime since summer time so it was pretty good BUT I should have got it NO ice. Why? When I got like a bit more than half way through, it started tasting watery. All in all I was okay happy."}
{"text":"This is a better place than the one at UTM; the place is always packed and messy even when it's not busy...That's one part I find it unappealing."}
{"text":"This place isn't a place to hang out with your friends. I honestly don't think I would go back here again. The place is relatively busy and I'm disappointed in how they deal with the customers when it's really busy"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea spot I've been to in the GTA. Always consistent and great bubble tea. They're having their 5 year anniversary, and to celebrate they have the SUPERCUP. What's the supercup you ask? 1 litre of bubble tea! never had anything like this before lol

Signature Chatime Pearl Milk Tea"}
{"text":"I usually dont write a review or comment but this location is the slowest and so not efficient. Not only was this the first time but more than 5 times.  I am next in line and hoping this time around it would be fast.  I usually give places the benefit of the doubt but this was just  ridicules.  Waited for 15mins in line while the whole crew was behind one cashier.  Very slow service, when there is a line forming they could have open another cashier or even confront that it may take a few mins.  Over and over again this place has disappointed me and this could be the last time i will come to this location!"}
{"text":"Good tea just like other Chatime locations. Only downside to this is a very very long wait. 
It took 35 mins for me to get my drink!!
 (?^?)? the store wasn't busy at all. Don't get me wrong, I've been to the Chatime at North York and downtown... I've never experienced such slow service."}
{"text":"Best Bubble tea in town!
I don't have sweet tooth but these teas give me cravings sometime lol. 
My fav is GlassJelly Roasted Milk Tea (#2) and add tapioca or Pudding, taro and grapefruit with coconut jelly. 

Why 4 stars..?
- when they get too busy, they often mess up the orders. Make sure to check them! 
- If you come after 10, make sure check availability of tapioca cuz it ran out most of the time."}
{"text":"I do love the drinks here, I just wish the space was bigger and more efficient for serving customers. The line is always through the door and the seats are always packed, I did see that they're opening a location at Square one soon so it might help with the volume issue. When it's too crazy I go in and go right back out. I have also noticed a couple of times that they have machines down and aren't able to make the drinks that I request- which is a big let down. All in all- they make good drinks (when they're able) and I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Drinks are not as good compare to the Gibson and warden location. However, Environment is great here and it is a good place for people to catch up/ study. Positive side it has a bakery, and if you were hungry you can grab something quick.

Service: 3/5
Drinks: 3/5
Environment: 4/5

Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"The drinks are always consistent, it's the same wherever you order(Dundas, pmall). Quick, but I only order one most of the time. The drinks I've tried are all very sweet so I always get HALF SUGAR. The milk teas(roasted, brewed oolong) are okay at half sugar, but then I taste milk at %30 sugar(flavoured milk is okay, but I don't like the taste of pure milk). Fruit teas: at half sugar, mango green tea is okay but the grapefruit green tea is SO SWEET. The mango smoothie and strawberry smoothie are both still quite sweet at half sugar. 

Order less sugar for the fruit drinks. 

I know this is real tea because I have to go wee wee in less than an hour. Like it not da cheap powder stuff."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after movies and while the line is crowded the wait is worth it.  We got the taro milk tea less ice and less sugar with pudding .  We  loved the drink and wish we had ordered it with tapioca as well. If we do return again we will make to come at a slow time so we do not have to wait long .  I recommend what we tried . You will like it"}
{"text":"Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. Soooo mmm. I always go late at night to avoid the lines which I hear extend all the way out the door. Hopefully the novelty dies down so I can go more regularly."}
{"text":"I love the fact that the bubble teas are customizable in terms of sugar and ice content. I love that I can have my tea with 0% or 30% sugar and no ice! If only starbucks had that option too!!"}
{"text":"This place has really become favourite of mine. I've been coming to the Brentwood location more often then the downtown mostly because of it is pretty close to the University, however there is one thing that this location has that the other doesn't. Two words: POPCORN CHICKEN. Seriously, get yourself a bag and enjoy a little snack while sippin on some delicious bubble tea. I have been trying more and more of the menu, but my favourite is the earl grey milk tea with 30% sugar, you get more of the earl grey flavour. If you want more of a refreshing tea taste, try the grapefruit tea with no sugar. Its more of a tart taste, but still delicious.

The place is pretty spacious and has two floors, with some comfy seating upstairs. There are also large desks and plug-ins and I've seen people working/studying there as it's pretty quite. Lots of options from the menu to choose from. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Their prices are so expensive for bubble tea and then they add so much ice! It's a rip off for sure."}
{"text":"Long waiting list to get cold drinks and the place is really limited. Everyone is squish together... This kinda suck."}
{"text":"Chatime is great. One of my top favourite bbt places in sauga. I usually end up going to the Chatime in Square one because it's more convenient when I'm already at the mall. Biggest bonus is their vicinity points which allows you to accumulate points for free drinks in the future redeemable at any locations. The price point isn't too bad as compared to Bubble Republic and it's great on the go. Sometimes service can get really slow, just really depends on the time you go. 

There are some seats in the store if you wanted to sit and chill, but when it gets too packed you probably won't get one. 

3* only because of this location. I hate finding parking here and getting out of the parking lot. Burnhamthorpe is so congested at times, it's so hard to get out. 
4* for Chatime in general for selection and quality of the drinks."}
{"text":"New location in the T & T Plaza (16th and Woodbine). They offer typical menu like the other locations. It was Uber busy during opening week; had to wait a long time to order and waited another whie to get the drinks.
They have a few small tables for you to sit and mingle with friends. 
This location offers Bake Code products too. Their pastry is supposed to be Asian and European fusion I believe. They come with high price tag. The buns are better than chinese bakeries; however, not worth paying 2.5-3x more."}
{"text":"I have been to many Cha-time in Canada and am always eager to try a new one.

The basics you expect at a each visit - busy, orderly and busy.

This Cha-time was busy but the cashier made it seem even busier, they were new.  
Realistically, it would have been for them to switch the inexperience in the back making the drinks rather than taking the orders.

This location has nice seating and its spacious.  The quality of the drink is uniform to the other locations, but the North York location seems to have it on point.

It's a good location, just parking is a little tight. 

The brand still is consistent, still getting my weekly dose of - CHATIME MILK QQ JELLY.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the most inefficient chatime I've ever been to. I am a huge fan of chatime normally, and expect that on weekends it can get busy. However, the operation of this chatime was just a complete mess. It was almost painful to watch the staff struggle to complete the orders behind the counter. Everyone was getting into everyone's way, drinks were spilling left right and centre, and it was a complete chaos. Honestly, there weren't even a lot of people, there was no line up to order. The staff on duty were just particularly inefficient... they probably could use some assembly line training... 

We waited forever for our one simple pearl milk tea. The funny thing is the staff also likes to withhold the drinks so that they can give out all the drinks order in chronological order. Shouldn't they be making drinks in the order that they were received anyway? Seems like a huge waste of everyone's time...

Good thing I don't live in Mississauga. I would never want to come back to this location."}
{"text":"What a nice little spot for a cool, refreshing beverage on a hot, sunny Summer's day!  Chatime serves to please!  A nice little spot in Brentwood Mall where the new condos have sprung up.  It's a big, roomy restaurant with a space for ordering your drinks and food and then a nice little open space to just chill out. Has an industrial yet elegant look about it.  Free wifi available.  We ordered the following:
- Classic Hazelnut Milk Tea
- Strawberry Milk Tea
- Green Tea Latte - no sugar
- Brown Rice Green Milk  - no sugar (added my own stevia)

All drinks were well liked.  Very clean and polite staff.

Takes all credit cards and debit.

Free parking in the front (if you can snag a spot)."}
{"text":"Chatime is by far my favorite bubble tea in Montreal. They are the only place I've found that actually gives you proper 30% sugar, 1/2 ice when you ask for it - other places still end up giving me a cup that's essentially 5/6 ice and 1/6 sugar water. 

My favorite drink at ChaTime is the Passion Fruit QQ. It's just one of those drinks you can get on the streets of Taipei but that are hard to find elsewhere. The passion fruit tastes surprisingly natural and the jelly and tapioca are of an enjoyable consistency.

My only complaint about this place is the price. So expensive  but at least they have a rewards card that can be used around the world!"}
{"text":"Pretty wonderful place. 

When you first go in, it seems a little underdecorated and plain. 

There are a lot of choices on the menu. It can get pretty overwhelming, but they put a list of 10 or 12 of their most popular drinks. Really makes things easier! 

Their drinks are super tasty and I always opt for a large. Some of them are really filing. I had a large brown rice + red bean one last time and I was so full after drinking it around 3pm that I ended up most eating supper! 

They also have tables upstairs and booths downstairs with outlets close by. It's very practical when you want to study while sipping your bubble tea. Oh and they have free wifi! The password is writing on the blackboard upstairs. 

They also sell a few pastries if you're hungry for something a big heavier. They smell sooooo good! 

You should definitely stop by if you're nearby :)"}
{"text":"Chatime's drinks are good! Some of my favorites include the coconut milk tea, strawberry milk tea, mango juice, and coconut smoothie-- all of course with 100% sugar and tapioca \"bubbles\". My only qualm is that Chatime is very expensive; there is no reason why a small smoothie with tapioca should cost $6!

I've been to two other Chatimes in Montreal, the one in Chinatown and the Concordia area, and honestly this location is not as good as the others. As others have mentioned in their reviews, the drinks at the other stores have a better taste and quality. One plus about this location however, is that it is significantly larger than the others and serves as a great place to meet up with friends to catch up, study, etc. The front desk even has board games they let customers use-- just don't forget to ask!"}
{"text":"Today was Chatime's grand opening and I was super excited it was in Mississauga. A friend and I arrived around 1 pm and were able to get their BOGO coupon. It wasn't super packed as I thought it would be but still quite busy during the weekday afternoon. 

I ordered the grass jelly roasted milk tea and my friend got the pearl milk tea. The drinks took about five minutes to make which isn't that long compared to Bubble Republic. Both of our drinks tasted great and did not differ from their other locations. Also, they sell donuts too.

The interior decor is nice and modern. There are about 10 tables in Chatime that you can sit at. 

I'm glad that there is a Chatime near my area where I can grab bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Chatime in Montreal means I won't have to line up in the Toronto Yonge Dundas one! Service is also excellent in this quiet little bubble tea shop. I find Nos Thés have THE BEST tapioca, and Chatime's tapioca is gross.

I'll order without tapioca next time. 

Service is wonderful here. It's slow though (because it's quiet so they only hire one guy). He's really nice."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. So far, it is the best I've had in Montréal.  Jasmine green milk tea with pearls.
Only downside is there is a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"**DURIAN MILK TEA POST**
From April 1 - April 7, durian milk tea is being served at select locations.. the Mississauga location being one of the lucky ones. You have the option for: (1) regular durian milk tea, or (2) durian roasted milk tea. I got to cha time the first day of this promotion and tried the durian roasted milk tea, 50% sugar, with grass jelly.

Conclusion: I like it!! Add this to the permanent menu!

What can I say, I'm a fan of this new drink! It has that distinct yellow colour of durian drinks and I was quite satisfied with the taste. I'm not a durian connoisseur, but I really think it tastes pretty close to the real thing. I let a few of my friends who eat durian more than I do try some, and they seem to really like it as well. At 50% sugar, I found it a little sweet for my liking - order this drink a sugar level down if you want it to suit your typical sugar preference as this drink does taste pretty sweet. 

The promotion is still ongoing for a few days, so definitely try this out before it ends!"}
