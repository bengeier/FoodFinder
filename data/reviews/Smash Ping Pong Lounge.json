{"text":"Came to Smash Ping Pong Lounge a Wednesday evening. The place was not overly-packed but each table was occupied. Mostly co-workers getting post-work drinks.  They have 6 tables or so, a basketball game, and a boxing game. Drinks are priced high, but it's understandable. The price increases throughout the week. Employee mentioned something along the lines of Mondays: $10/hr for ping pong, Tues $15, Wed $20, and so on.. Simple but smart (demand).  I ordered their signature mojito, which I found to be too sweet for my liking. They have $3 Jack Daniels Honey shots everyday of the week if you wanna get weird. They are not full shots, they are more like big shot glasses, filled half way up. Still lit, regardless.  If you get hungry, get a chicken quesadilla ( server recommended). It comes hot and cheesy with a few lettuce leaves  and salsa. My only wish was give me some sour cream! Don't expect unreal food. You are at a Ping Pong Lounge. Expect it be similar to bowling alley food. Greasy junk food that hits the spot after a few drinks. Parking is free along Queen St after 6pm! Just make sure you do not park in front of the Toyota Dealership across the street, you may get ticketed!  Only negative about this place is the lighting. Only one table is spotlighted like a Kanye West Ultralight beam, while others are more \"dim\". This means you need to play with the orange balls to see better. Improve the lighting, and make it more consistent Smash!   Check out Prohibition next door after Ping Pong, if you want to keep the party going. They have drink specials after 10pm!  I will return to Smash Ping Pong Lounge!"}
{"text":"I attended a birthday party here. The space was clean and spacious. We had the whole 2nd floor for the party.  My main complaints are that there were only about 4 seats on the whole 2nd floor, so it wasn't that comfortable for people not playing ping pong. The food was so-so, definitely not worth the high prices ($18 for a plate of nachos - no meat, didn't arrive super hot). The service was also quite slow - they admitted that our food was 2nd priority to another party on the main floor, but whatever the explanation I didn't appreciate waiting 45 minutes for a plate of fries."}
{"text":"Fun Times! Great Staff and reasonable pricing. Would recommend to anyone looking to let off some steam and have a good time"}
{"text":"Went there last night for a birthday and had a great time!  Our server was boss and was on the ball the whole night. Incredible service, offering water and always chiming in at the right time to take orders.   The only negative thing was the music was too loud!   But still a great, fun night!"}
{"text":"Best place for a night out with friends! Had a great time food, drink, and fun! Staff were very quick at replenishing ping pong balls. Drinks came quick, staff were great, music was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place. The adjusted badminton racquet with fishing net is probably the best invention since sliced toast. The prices are slightly better than spin on king west."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and whether you end up enjoying your time here really depends on who you're with.  Coming here means that you can play ping pong without worrying about picking up after yourself, in theory.  Each ping pong table has a bucket with ping pong balls that's refilled regularly.  The good: - Ping pong with friends  The so-so: - We ordered and shared all of the pizzas.  Nothing really stood out.  - The deep fried pick was OK but is hard to mess up - The pita with 3 dips was pretty average and not worth the $14 - There are tables beside each ping pong table but there's limited seating so if you're ordering a bunch of food and have a lot of people, it can get crowded.  The bad: - We went on a Saturday night and there was only one person collecting the balls so our bucket was frequently empty."}
{"text":"Great food, came here for a night out provided by my company. Ordered the cider on tab there. If was the first time I tried it and taste pretty good. Street Parking available for free after 6pm . Our night out was from 7pm -11pm. No need for us to pick up the balls as they have a scoop that makes it easy for us to pick it up. Washroom was for co-Ed. The burger slider taste very good! Great selections of beers on tab I would say."}
{"text":"When I lived in Toronto I used to come here once a week for a spin class, but now it's a ping pong club where my friend had his 40th birthday party. Not a ton has changed with the interior other than opening things up a little more and changing the locker rooms to bathrooms on the second floor.  They cleared out the second level minus one table and opened it up for the couple hundred(?) people they were expecting throughout the night. I was there to help with the initial bit of setup, though the staff did almost everything. There seemed to be a bit of confusion at first. It seemed that they don't do large special events that often and needed to get themselves sorted out.  Once things were underway though it was all great. They had some decent food throughout the night which mostly consisted of typical pub food. They had a professional DJ, who was also a friend, do the music for the night."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner on Valentine's Day for a fun date. It's a lot smaller than spin downtown but so much cheaper. We only paid $15/hr (for a tuesday) plus free street parking. This alone makes it completely worth it to come. That being said, the service here is not great. There was one gentleman working and he looked absolutely miserable. He was not refilling our buckets of balls so I had to pick ours off the floor. I looked over and he was just sitting there - it wasn't like he was busy or anything. Maybe he was missing out on a Valentine's date, who knows. Anyway it's cheap so who cares!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lots of fun. The seats weren't to comfortable. Having the punching machine, the basketball machine and the charger for the phone in the back is a nice touch. My only gripe is that for people that are not drinking alcohol why do we have to pay so much for soda it wouldn't be that bad if most of the drink was soda but it seems like three or 4 sips and it was gone it was all ice."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want  to mix a wholesome event in a venue where the adults can have fun too. Lots of space for ping pong and arcade cabinets throughout.   The bar and food are pretty decent compared to other places in the area so I was surprised to find the mix of fun, food and great service."}
{"text":"We came here last night for an office party and it was so much fun! We had the whole top floor which had 5 tables and a separate bar. Tables, paddles & balls are brand new and that fishnet badminton racket thing is so smart. The food was delicious - we ordered spanikopita, spring rolls, charcuterie platter, veggie platter, the friggin best pita and bruschetta spread, and mini cheeseburger sliders which were so good. I love food and even though they were all horderves they were good =) Drink were good, the staff were very friendly and the service was great. The music was good and wasn't too loud so we could still hear each other, which was something we were worried about.  We'll definitely be coming back either as a group or individually. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Really nice spot.  I've been a very regular Spin Social Club visitor since they opened (ie. the only other ping pong bar in Toronto) so I was really happy to hear another similar bar opened.  Went to Smash Lounge recently and it totally doesn't disappoint at all.  They have about 10 ping pong tables, all seemingly brand new and in great shape.  Same premise as spin where you get a big bucket of balls and don't have to chase them around when they fly away from your table.  Beer selection is solid and prices are pretty reasonable.  It's only $15/hour before 6pm which is a fantastic price. As for food I tried the meatballs and fries and they were both tasty.  I dig the place and hope it has success and the pricing stays solid.  If you dig ping pong you should definitely check out Smash. Only minor criticism is I wish the music was a bit less Top 40/urban kind of stuff and more Rock/Electronic."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends on a Saturday night. There was a lot of positives about this experience including the very affordable ping pong table rentals and drinks. However, this was unfortunately overshadowed by the less than attentive server who seemed to want to cater more to friends than paying customers. We waited quite a while to order drinks or pay for our tab."}
{"text":"Whether you call it Ping Pong or Table Tennis, nothing tops the sport of my childhood. Now that I'm of legal age, Smash has taken the simple sport and revolutionized it by adding - yes - alcohol! This is a two story venue (I think you could book the top floor for private events) with some of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen. I usually dislike using public washrooms but the ones here made me feel like home. They have a cheap liquor special (Jameson and I believe JD for 4$/shot).  This place is perfect for a group of friends or family to come and have some fun. There's a punching bag machine, basketball machine where you could face off against a friend, a golf game and I believe a poker machine as well. It feels like a mini Dave & Busters. Overall, the ambiance, food, service and drinks were spectacular. Lots of places water down their drinks but this place doesn't. I highly recommend visiting here for a predrinking or even main drinking event. Ps: ask for Judie the bartender! She's amazing."}
