{"text":"The cappuccino is quite good, and the banana bread is my favourite (the best!). Croissants are served with butter and jam, but the pastry itself is not as good as other places (too soft).

I like sitting in the front window with a view of the sports bar across the street. I find the decor at this place to be more peaceful, and more coherent, than at some other caf√©s close by. In summer, I enjoy sitting outside under the young trees. 

Also, the owner is lovely."}
{"text":"What a cute little coffee shop. I stopped by on a weekday afternoon and was one of only a few customers. I liked that they had both sweet and savory snack options. I went for a sweet potato empanada that was warm and crunchy. My americano was fine too. The counter in the window was also a great place to relax and watch traffic go by."}
{"text":"Don't eat breakfast before coming here. In house muffins and freshly delivered empanadas.  Great coffee, good price, lots of seating.  A gem."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning and ordered a latte. Latte was good. This is one of those friendly neighbourhood cafes where the owner seems to know everyone who walks in. It was my first time there and she made an effort to get to know me which was kinda refreshing. The seating was interesting but comfortable (I sat in something that looked like a pew). My only feedback is that the fast Mexican/Spanish music in the background was a little distracting for anyone who wanted to do some work/reading while enjoying their beverage. Would definitely come back though."}
{"text":"I went into the Brockton Haunt for the first time today. It's a sweet little coffee shop down on West College St. 

My barista was very happy and so helpful! It was close to late afternoon so there wasn't a lot of food items left. My Barista (Deb) suggested one of the Empanadas. The Empanada was delicious. I wanted more but didn't want to seem greedy! I had a Rooibos tea to round it all out!

Great little place. I'll be back. For the Empanada, and a coffee next time."}
{"text":"Found out about this place through the coffee passport and was impressed. It has a very nice atmosphere, bright open decor with lots of seating. The staff was friendly and the cappuccino was great too. 10/10 would come back again."}
{"text":"I came here as part of the Indie Coffee Passport (ICP) 
This is a small cafe with limited seating. They do bake their good in house so there is nice aroma emanating in the space.  
here is the verdict on the cappuccino
Espresso: Medium/strong flavor
Crema': OK
Milk: Frothed well nice microfoam.
Latte Art: decent
I would say 3 stars. 
We also tried a pineapple/carrot muffin and despite my reservations it did taste good.
3 stars all said and done."}
{"text":"3 stars

This place catches your eye as you walk/drive by with its big sign on the window. Then on the door there is a small sign most people will miss and it is a 'Pilot Coffee Roasters' sign, which means they serve, at least, good roasts. Seeing this sign was a very good start to my experience here. 

It is a small little shop arranged in a unique way. It has a real homey atmosphere - almost a modern 60s feel. Having only been open since June of 2013 it has really succeeded.

In talking with the owner I found it is a family run shop with a mother and her daughters. The owner is a wonderful lady who is committed to serving great coffee and awesome baked goods. All the food is baked in-house with a small little oven - as the owner says \"my easy-bake oven\" - apart from the empanadas, those are baked fresh everyday and brought in at 7am.

The coffee is great and as expected when serving Pilot Roasted coffee.

I think I may have found my new spot on the west end. This place is great and should be frequented by those around here.

That's it."}
{"text":"Love it. It's my new workspace now. Given that it's in a fairly quiet neighbourhood, also with lots of other cafe options - there was ample space when I got here around 11:30am on a Friday. It started willing up around 1pm with most of the tables taken. 

Small tables and bar stools at the front - with a bigger communal table at the back, more bar stools and a two seater. 

Coffee was okay, but their hot chocolate was REALLY GOOD. For snacks, nothing gluten free, but everything looked quite tempting. They have small empanadas, which were ample in the morning and all gone by 2pm. 

They also have a copy of Settlers and other board games, I guess for anyone that just wants a place to hang out, rather than do work. 

Parking is pricey on the street, but lots of 1 hr options along the residential street, except when there are snow banks that cover everything!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, clean and calm coffee place. Great atmosphere for work or chat with friends. It is a family own coffee shop with home made sweat treats and sandwiches. What is really important as well - they have really good coffee!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I tried to come here and it was a success. First time I tried I had a hard time finding it and when I did, it was closed for the day.

Find some parking on the street and hop in for a coffee. This place has a little nook up a few steps inside with more seats. It's in a more quiet neighbourhood, but next to an elusive pho restaurant.

The coffee itself, I had a cappuccino and it's a decent piece of caffeine. The place seems pretty chill to relax and sit around, maybe do some work.

Is it a destination, I wouldn't go so far without trying more. Is it probably nice to get a cup here, yes. Plus, I didn't see any Starbucks in the area. I'd grab a cup if I was in the area eating around there. The girls who (appear like they) run the place seem quite friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"It's fine, the service is perfectly friendly and not too much on a Wednesday morning. They always offer nice morning snacks. However there is something weird about the taste of their espresso - like overly burnt and kind of old, but the barista ground the beans in front of me. All three times I've gone I've noticed the taste. Aside from that it's a nice place!

Ok just ate the croissant they sold me and it looked fine even though they said it was a day old, but they shouldn't even sell these - incredibly dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Kris and Julie are skilled in the art of customer service. I moved to Toronto without knowing a single person and ended up spending a lot of time writing at The Brockton Haunt. They were always very friendly and showed an interest in how I was doing. I am thankful that they were a part of my Toronto experience. They truly made a difference by giving me somewhere to belong. And it wasn't just me...I watched Kris and Julie talk with all of their customers in the same way. They know their customers and serve them as friends.

Not only is their coffee fantastic, their homemade baked goods are perfect. You definitely want to try the Morning Glory muffin. I have since moved back to the US and every once in a while, I think about how much I would love to have one. Their s'mores cookies are also amazing. Do yourself a favor and stop by for a cozy and warm experience. I can't recommend The Brockton Haunt enough."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome snacks, wicked drinks. The staff are super friendly, and it's a really great spot to work out of on occasion."}
{"text":"Went to The Brockton Haunt for the first time and I'm impressed.

Nice coffee shop on the west end with seating for roughly 15 people inside.  Standard coffee & espresso-based drinks with a few seasonal drink offers, baked goods, and empanadas.  Barista was very friendly.

We had the zucchini loaf and the spinach & bacon empanada.  Zucchini loaf was moist and came on a heated plate.  Empanada was accompanied with a chutney and dipping sauce.  Both were excellent.

$2 tax-in for double americanos and espresso.  Brockton Haunt uses 'Big Bro' espresso from a great local roaster (Pilot, formerly Te Aro).

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, tasty, made in house baked goods. A great place to study or work during the week as it's often on the quiet side and has a solid wifi connection. Beautiful interior with lots of light. Also, I'm usually into the music they've got going on the speakers."}
{"text":"A cool coffee shop close to my workplace, cozy and  friendly, always a great choice to have a quality espresso to kick start my day"}
{"text":"This place is really good! They have a good selection of drinks, and treats! I usually get the Americano which I find to be very pleasing. It doesn't have the burnt taste that some do, and its strong enough to not taste weak either. The servers are very friendly and helpful (like they will explain a drink if you are unsure). The baked goods range from muffins, to zucchini bread (my personal favorite!)  to chorizo empanadas.

The location is on the smaller side, but if you make it in early or at a less crowded time you have the intimacy of the place for yourself."}
{"text":"I've grown to love it when new cute places open in my slowly gentrifying neighbourhood. Brockton Haunt just opened recently and seems to be settling in quite nicely on the College Westeros strip. I popped in today to grab some much needed caffeinated beverages, I was greeted with a nice bright space reminiscent of White Squirrel on WQW and a nearly empty cafe. The register is the de rigueur iPad type of machine popping up everywhere which is kind of fun. 


I got two iced americanos, it came to $5.10 for both which is nice and affordable for a good sized iced beverage. My only complaint is that the barrista was a bit slow and wound up topping up my drinks with more water which breaks the crema of the espresso. Such a coffee nerd complaint but I feel like it's legit. 

Nevertheless I really enjoyed my beverage, and the place has an a/c unit that was working OT to cool it down. 

Welcome to the neighbourhood. Best of luck!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to stumble across this amazing little place. The inside is inviting and perfect for reading, working, or just chatting with friends. The pastries are made fresh daily by Owner - Chris, and I'll just say my blueberry scone was the best I've had. Pay close attention when walking down College because you won't want to miss this place!"}
{"text":"When my friend and I decided to go study at a cafe, The Brockton Haunt was actually not our original destination. We got off at College to find out Playful Grounds was closed. We were surprised, considering the posted hours said they were supposed to be open that afternoon. It wasn't until later that day I found out that the cafe had shut down (Indie Coffee Passport haven't announced it yet on their website for some reason). I was annoyed, considering the distance we travelled. Luckily, I found out there was another cafe on College a couple of blocks away, which was The Brockton Haunt.

Arriving upon the cafe, we found that the small space was almost full. The only place we were able to sit at was at the front of the window. Although there were only a handful of seats available, the place made up for it with its interesting interior layout. I like the fact that they had a back corner on the top of a couple of stairs. It made a cozy and intimate space. The cafe features an artist every couple of months where you could buy the displayed artworks. Their specialty drink is their \"Haunt\" Chocolate, which is a double mocha latte with a hint of mint. I wished it was on their ICP menu so I could have tried it!

I noticed while I was there how busy it got. Many customers came in and had to buy their coffee-to-go. It's always a good sign when you see a cafe with constant traffic. Overall, I think The Brockton Haunt is a cute cafe in a nice location and is the locals' favourite!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty chill spot that has the hipster cool vibe.  There is a bit of seating and the large window provides the cafe with a nice lightness.  I have to give them kudos for seeing them make their own baked treats... one of the staff was mixing the dough while I was there.  

On my College St explorations, I stopped by Brockton Haunt because they said they had 'REAL' Pumpkin Spice Latte.  Seeing how the past few drinks I've had from Starbucks have been really lacking, this intrigued me a lot.

Real Pumpkin Spice Latte - This is a pretty nice espresso based drink which has a good kick of spice and nice rounded coffee flavour.  I wouldnt say it was as rich or spicy flavourful to be my favourite but it's a very solid cup that is enjoyable.  It come with a cute latte art that was a bit more unique that your typical leaf pattern.  4/5"}
{"text":"This is certainly a neighbourhood joint coffee place. Serving up coffee and biscuit treats, everyone seems to be glued to their books or computers. Barista is a friendly lady who certainly knows how to make a good coffee art. I also live how they support local coffee and one of my favourite Pilot coffee beans.

Pop in for a quick pick me up mid day."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy the cafe since it is nearby and I love supporting local businesses, but I found the chai latte quite bland and the chairs in the front too uncomfortable to do any work. I tried to move to the back and it was so hot without any air flow so I had to find another place to work. I would most likely not go back."}
