{"text":"Ordered the grill pork and egg roll with noodles without peanuts. Took 27 minutes to get the food. When I opened the food to make sure there's no peanuts, look and behold there's peanuts on it. Gave it back to them and 3-5 minutes later I am given a \"new\" Togo and was told sorry. Got home and look and behold there's peanuts still left over. They clearly just try to remove the peanuts and given me same food!!  Having a family member that was allergic to peanut I had to trashed the food. They should have taken allergies more seriously  because it could have killed someone and they could been sued. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We have taken many friends there and everyone loves it. Plus the prices are very reasonable. Our favorite dish is the Vietnamese Pho, 5 meat. You could drowned in the large. They offer a small but it is not listed on the menu (something like $8.50). Plus the corkage is something like $7 per."}
{"text":"Best pho food in town. Grate atmosphere and a awesome work staff. Nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's day and it was amazing! We got nothing but sushi. They are very affordable for typical sushi rolls. They also have specialty rolls and Nigiri that's more on the pricier side. Their sushi tastes extremely fresh and delicious! The spicy sauce they gave us to dip the sushi in was definitely the cherry on top! The restaurant is very clean, from the dining area to the bathrooms. The waiters are also very nice. We had a waitress who surprised us with a rose on the table when we got there! Very Valentines appropriate :3 They even let us take it home! and yes, it was a real rose! Furthermore, I was pleasantly surprised to find that their water also tasted clean and clear. It didn't taste like typical city water (like chlorine) so that was definitely nice.   P.S the tiger rolls are delicious!"}
{"text":"It's likely a place is going to be either really exciting or really bizarre when there is a Lucite stripper shoe with a melted heel on the sidewalk in front of it. Sadly, Asian Roll & Grill in Tega Cay, South Carolina, wouldn't be classified as really exciting or really bizarre, even though there was a Lucite stripper shoe with a melted heel on the sidewalk in front of it.   The feel of the place is a little incongruent. Tables don't fit quite right within the booths, but that is part of the oddly familiar appeal. The owner and the servers are eager to please without being overzealous, and the dining room is spotless. Over in the bar, the blue tile provides a sleeker background for sushi noshing than the main dining area. Patio dining looks like it would be popular for diners and would draw in other customers. However, even in pretty weather, the umbrellas remain closed and customers are behind windows tinted so dark it is hard to tell if the restaurant is open.  Some not so great things about Asian Roll & Grill: They don't have brown rice, they don't take the skin off of the grilled chicken, and the Vermicelli Bowls are a little heavy on the vermicelli. A certain server will tell you they can't make the Summer Rolls substituting tofu for shrimp. When it is explained to that server exactly how the substitution works, it miraculously happens. (Why wouldn't it be an option? The whole conversation was strange and not due to a language barrier.)  The Pho, though, is well, PHOnomenal (sic). Huge portions of the fresh and comforting soup are Asian Roll and Grill's dish forte. Fresh house made chicken stock mixed with noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro and choice of meat are crave-worthy. Although there isn't a specific children's menu, the Miso soup, Yakitori, large bowls of Edamame and Fried Rice are winners with discerning kids.  As a whole, Asian Roll & Grill is on the cusp of being a favorite small town eatery, especially compared to some of the other Japanese/Chinese/Vietnamese fusion restaurants in the area. With a few small improvements, it could corner the market."}
{"text":"We have been eating here since they opened. There is a dearth of non-chain restaurants in Fort Mill that have \"real\" food and not burgers, fries, and sandwiches. Asian Roll and Grill is very reasonably priced and always fresh. I get the vegetable and tofu pho--the broth is incredible. It's the fastest take-out ever--we've never waited more than 20 minutes from the time we picked up the phone to the minute we walk out the door. My husband likes the chicken fried rice but we both love the Vietnamese rolls--they are so healthy and fresh and very generous in size. Many nights they have half-price maki rolls when you order a full-priced roll order, and that's a great way to try a new kind of sushi. We haven't really eaten inside the restaurant, but for take-out, it's our go-to Asian night restaurant. I took one star away because sometimes they get the order wrong (it's best to check the bag before you walk out the door)."}
{"text":"I ordered to pick up and the lady on the phone was really nice, told her that its going to be my first time eating Pho-Vietnames noddle soup and she recommended the combination. they packed the soup and noddles separately so it won't be soggy by the time I got home and it tasted amazing. My husband had the combination fried rice and loved it. I also ordered the Godzilla Roll and a shrimp roll and it was great. My ordered cost $42 which seemed a lot at the moment but it was a lot of food that we even had left overs."}
{"text":"Solid feed here folks!  Great noodle bowl and excellent service!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 sushi rolls and 1 egg roll, i would not suggest the Vietnamese spring roll, taste was a little bland; but the sushi was amazing!! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm terribly disappointed that Yelp led me to the Asian Roll & Grill.  Let's begin with the food:  The pho was without a doubt, the least flavorful I have ever had...and I've had alot of pho.  If they're building a savory pho from scratch...they sure fooled me, because it tasted like something from powder or a can.  No matter where you get pho, they're going to give you the fresh goodies to go along with the noodles and broth.  This doesn't make the pho itself good.  I won't bother getting into the other dishes tried as they were also mediocre.  The decor of Asian Roll & Grill looks like a DIY project.  There's definitely not a Feng Sui to the place.  The layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow.  The service was OK, but it didn't matter much considering the less than average fare.   Try:  I'm not really sure what to say here.  The sushi seems to be a hit...but then again...the pho seemed to be recommended as well.    Avoid:  The pho.  Seriously...if you eat pho regularly, you will find this to be a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service. Cozy place to grab dinner in Fort Mill. Ask for sonny sauce (house spicy soy sauce), a delicious compliment to your sushi. Vietnamese roll appetizer very good."}
{"text":"We were looking for noodles near home and discovered this gem! We were immediately greeted by Sonny, who we believe is the owner.    We ordered yakitori  (chicken katsu), gyoza  (pork and vegetable), udon with sautéed chicken and lots of delicious vegetables. VEGETABLES - carrots, onion, broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, bok choy, celery and pea pods.  We preferred the pork gyoza but both were tasty.   Gyoza or pot stickers are served with ponzu sauce.  For those who love spice, just ask for Sonny's sauce and it will add a kick to anything you dip or pour it into as my husband did with the udon.   Love my sake. I have learned you can never go wrong with hot sake. Ordered a large bottle and it was delicious.  Fantastic service, delicious food, and wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. I eat sushi a lot and have very high standards, which asian roll and grill lives up to. The sushi meat is always fresh, vegetables never over ripe, rice never overcooked, and very much attention to detail is paid to the presentation of the sushi. The rolls they have on the menu are all very good. You cant go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Dinner here with a friend after work. I was craving ramen. They have ramen bowls and I got the one with salmon. It was pretty good. I should have asked for the salmon to be grilled medium but otherwise I enjoyed both the appetizer and entree."}
{"text":"Everything is always very fresh. Absolutely the best Pho I've had since I used to eat in Chinatown in Boston. This place is definitely worth a visit. Try the Spring Rolls. They are fantastic!"}
{"text":"it was a little bit of a wait but well worth it.. not the biggest portions but everything was tasty.. will definitely come back... miss rose was very nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and damn clean restrooms. Noodle bowls and stir fry are great."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. Finally I did, and was super disappointed. There is no lunch menu, and the food is very overpriced for what it is. They are really stingy with the portions- specifically the meat. My bit of grilled pork (with vermicelli) was tasty, but my partner's food was subpar - dry chicken and beef with rubbery shrimp that lacked seasoning. This came with fried rice- it may have worked in the soup but who knows. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"If there are specials, read the board because they do not tell unless asked.... so we missed out.  Tried Pho and meat was so chewy, but broth was nice.  Toppings not supper crisp, but okay.  For almost 13.00 it should be awesome.....nothing awesome.   Sign of odd to me is serving soda in a can for 1.50 a can.   Better options close, real close by.  Service was the order, delivering food with no smile and no follow up, a few extra limes would have been nice."}
{"text":"They've got great variety of Asian dish on the menu! No matter what you get you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I have been enjoy this restaurant for several years but today I had Ty serve us. She normally hides in the kitchen cooking as her language skills are not as good as she would like. She needs to get out of the kitchen as she is a WONDERFUL server. The food is  VERY fresh and if your not sure what to get ask. I have never been disappointed. Thanks Ty for taking care of me like my mother does."}
{"text":"The Pho is legit. Coming from Southern California where Pho restaurants are very common this place could hang with them. The downside is it's expensive. For $10-$12 in SoCal you could almost get two orders, not one."}
{"text":"Be careful if you're allergic to shellfish and order via phone for take out...just arrived to pick up my veg sushi after having a lengthy discussion on the phone about the fact that I was allergic to fish.  The woman that answered the phone/was taking my order said they did not have fish in them...  I explained that I needed different knives to be used when cutting my sushi vs my boyfriend's.  next time I'll emphasize that I also need my veg sushi to not be touching my boyfriend's shellfish filled sushi...  they're re-making mine as I write this, so I may update my review once I actually taste the veg sushi.  either way, be careful when ordering if you have a good sensitivity or allergy.  when asked how his sushi was, boyfriend said: \"there are better options.  I would rather eat publix sushi than get sushi from this place again.\"  I'll attach some pictures of tempura veg and tempura sweet potato and cream cheese (#3&4)...while the employees were very apologetic and quickly re-made my 2 rolls, you could tell they did it more quickly than they should have.  the pieces were too big to eat with chopsticks (which we did not receive) and just didn't taste good.    I don't normally write negative reviews, but for $30, you can get 4 much tastier rolls elsewhere.  ru san's is still the #1 place for sushi in charlotte."}
{"text":"I give it a 5 star! Amazing food and service. I was a bit confused on was taking my order, there were 3 people waiting on me and end ask the sushi chef to assist me in future orders. I would have rated 4 but, the sushi, spring rolls and pho was so amazing and fresh it deserves a 5 star rating. The rolls are a healthy serving and the spring rolls are WOW. My fav was the masago roll was my favorite. It was like a drug I had to get some to go. When I opened my to go box at home I had more than I ordered!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese, and decided on Asian Roll & Grill since it had lots of good Yelp reviews.  I placed a carry-out order of Shrimp Fried Rice which was good but missing something to enhance the taste.  The staff was inviting and I did not feel rushed or ignored, which has been my experience at other Chinese restaurants.  I will definitely return to Asian Roll and Grill."}
{"text":"I am not a sushi person, was simply looking for a close spot for some good hibachi style Japanese food.  The food was good but the value was far less than expected.  For $15 a plate I'm accustomed to having food left over.... Not the case here, and I can't say they made up for it in the quality of the food as it seemed comparable to other places I've dined.  I also wasn't happy with the $1.50 for a can soda....."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. The pho is obviously the main event (I highly recommend the veggies and fried tofu version) but I always get the gyoza as an appetizer too. They're like little dumplings stuffed with pork and vegetables, and usually served alongside green vegetarian option and soysauce-based sauce. I also would recommend the sushi as well, always fresh tasting and good quality. Sometimes the sweet tea is mixed with a hint of jasmine that isn't overpowering but a very refreshing twist on the classic southern beverage.  Overall, this is a place I will continue to bring my friends, dates, and family to."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service. Very nice staff. The pho is amazing! They will customize."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Top choices: Soup - Pho soup is the best I have had!    Sushi - I really enjoyed the Godzilla roll the most. Noodles - the grilled chicken vermicelli was great! Salad - the mixed green salad had green leaf, cucumbers, tomato, apples, mango, and a ginger dressing they make there fresh.  You can taste so many unique flavors in the dressing it really makes the salad.  Love the apples and mangos in it!"}
{"text":"While the sushi tasted good enough, the presentation was a little lacking and wasn't constructed well enough. The rolls kept falling apart and the nigiri could have been cut better and had better rice/meat proportions. The decor is very nice and the staff was very nice and responsive. Overall a little disappointing but look forward to going back and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite sushi! Everything is always so fresh and yummy. Ask for he shrimp dumplings and the Thai tea. It's not on the menu but is amazing! The dumplings come with a great dipping sauce that puts soy sauce to shame."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for sushi and hibachi. The sonny sauce is really good for sushi and ramen. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful for our large group. Portions were nice sized and service was quick. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ok Yelpers, you let me down today. The wife was craving some sushi and I wanted some Ramon.  Being new to the Fort Mill area yelp is always my go to.  However, While Asia Roll & Grill is highly rated, this was a let down.  The pros, great service..... the cons, the wait for food and the sushi.  Please stop serving and calling yourself a sushi bar, your not.  Stick to the China / Pho route as this is what your good at.  The sushi is not good, unless you call sushi a fried roll with fired fish (what are you hiding) in lieu of what is sushi is, good sashimi grade fish.  Examples you say,  the sashimi octopus looked like a dried up anchovy/mushroom and the tuna sashimi was three pieces of paper thin..... paper.  Unfortunately my search for good sushi in the Fort Mill area continues."}
{"text":"I only gave it four because I got takeout and havent had a dine in experience. I ordered the Pho(fa) and it was Pho-king awesome. They had it all separated and ready for me to assemble, I only assume this was done to ensure the freshness. I can't remember what everyone else had because I was so engrossed in my meal, but they said it was super tasty... I will definitely be heading back for more.  This prices are really good also. I believe they also have sushi.  Weird thing is that they shut down for a bit midday to set for the dinner service. So phone first."}
{"text":"We had arrived an hr early and the owner opened for us, welcoming and amazing service. Funny guy told us about how he was on TV. Wish I could always find good delicious food like this everywhere. Had a big bowl of pho!! It was wonderful,I live so far but can't wait to stop by someday!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had. Great service, nice people.  You will not be disappointed if you come here.   Solid tuna, not chopped that you see at many places today in rolls.  The rising sun role is spectacular!    Don't hesitate, come visit these fine folks!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Charlotte. Always so fresh and delicious. Their sushi is great also. Gyoza dumplings are amazing and so are the spring rolls. If you don't know what pho is, it's pronounced \"fuh\". A beefy broth with noodles and your choice of cuts of meat.  They give you a plate with fresh basil, parsley, bean sprout shoots, jalapeños, and lime wedges. Add as much or as little as you like. Be careful not to add too much chili paste or Sriracha hot sauce!  I am particularly fond of Fu Dac Biet.  Super-thinly sliced brisket, flank steak, and tendon, along with a nice quartered house-made meatball.  This is the first place I ever tried tendon. The consistency is likened to a slightly chewy, but melt-in-your-mouth Twizzler... But with a slight beefiness. I love it!  The staff here is always very friendly.  Great value.  I gave it only 4 stars because they play the most bizarre mix of teeny-bopper top-40 pop music I have ever heard in a restaurant. But go there with someone you like to converse with, and you won't even notice it...until you start slurping your pho!"}
{"text":"Not many know about this place b/c it is in Fort Mill, SC. But if you live in the Charlotte - Steel Creek area then its only 10-15 mins away from you!   I have tried almost everything from the menu from sushi, pho and yakitori sticks and I can say confidently that the food here is immaculate!   So glad its on my way from and to work!"}
{"text":"Best tasting Pho I've eaten anywheres in the Charlotte Metro Area. Service is great too. Nice, attractive location."}
{"text":"The whole family loves the food here and the kids tend to eat their fair share.  The staff is very friendly and they are efficient at getting your food out in a timely manor.  My only request is that they offer a kids menu.  It's hard having a 4 year old and choosing from the adult menu."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best pho in the area! I've been to every pho place in Charlotte.. Not saying other places don't have good pho.. But Asian Roll and Grill is clearly better. Staff can also speak perfect English. Ive been bringing friends here for about 6 months at least once a month  I'm the guy that gets the giant bowl of jalapeños for every bowl of pho!  See ya soon!"}
{"text":"I really give it a 3.5   - this place is hit or miss -never consistent - l love the pho, and the sushi, but everything else sometime is okay.  the staff is nice but some of them are not attentive and do not pay attention, asked for water and brought us hot water in a glass -very strange. Prices are okay - hope they don't go up, hope they get better with age and not comfortable."}
{"text":"This is a nicely decorated restaurant in a newish shopping strip mall with decent pho at a higher price point than those in the Boston, NY and DC areas. The Pho Dac Biet which should have all toppings was tasty with slices of cooked and rare beef, sliced meatball, and rice noodles swimming in a well-made broth (a bit more peppery than the other pho places). Conspicuously missing from the pho toppings are classics such as tripe and tendons. The Pork Chop Rice Plate only had a pork chop but is missing the savory chopped pork skin and egg omelette. The pho and other dishes tend to be smaller in size and more expensive per serving as compared to the other pho places at major cities. Service was a bit harried in the beginning with a room full of lunch-time diners but it was much improved once some of these diners left. Overall, it is a decent pho place but be prepare to pay more to save you a trip into Charlotte."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant!  Great food  (pho is my favorite. ..also a baked hot candle roll sushi....yummy!), good prices on drinks, wonderful service (Sonny is a charactwr!), and tables outside to catch sunset .....I always take my little dog!...nice music, not too loud,  My favorite restaurant!  Kirsten Parrish  tega cay."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and always enjoy the food. Probably a bit overpriced but not enough to be an issue.   Quality is always consistent."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bun Bo Hue ( Spicy noddle soup) today to go. The soup was cold and the meat was frozen. Pretty sure they toke the soup container out of the frig and packed it to go. Awful. Not worth 12.99."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Asian food in Fort Mill for the price, provided you like Pho or Sushi (because they don't have much else). The Pho and Summer Rolls are amazing. The Sushi and ambience is not quite as good as at Akahana in Baxter, but it's less expensive, which compensates."}
{"text":"Great meal!  My husband loves the rare beef pho.  I ordered a noodle bowl with veggies that was also great!!  Sometimes the vegetables get overlooked, but not here...everything was very good!"}
{"text":"Pho was delicious!! Sushi was very good too. Service was a little slow but they had a few large parties at lunch while I was there. I'll be craving that Pho thru the winter, I'm sure."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to score. This was a new visit for me as a local and my parents as visitors.  Overall, the food was good. No real issues there. What could use a lot of work is the service. My parents ordered sushi rolls as their app and requested they come out before their entree. They certainly did... if thirty seconds counts. That's not cool. They enjoyed the rolls they ordered and their main rice and meat entrees. I enjoyed my Pho.   Service lacked again when she never asked about more drinks or refills.   The interior needs some help. The booths had tears covered by tape and were pretty uncomfortable to sit in.. Wouldn't rush back, except possibly for take-out."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my wife and son. We all ordered the Pho Soup with different proteins in it. The soup was really good, as well as the service. The soup however is really expensive! 12/13.00 dollars for a bowl of soup IMO is expensive. I knew the prices going in but still wanted to try them out and was not disappointed at all with the soup. I will probably not be going back to often, not because of the food or the service but only because the price. It was almost 40.00 for 3 bowls of soup. I understand they have to make money but it's SOUP! Good SOUP! But SOUP! LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"Its pretty good but coming from living in Charlotte it is pricy for the amount they give you. If you are in Charlotte I would recommend Doans but if you are looking for pho in fort mill this is the spot to be."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Oustanding food. If it's been a while since you have eating here, you owe to yourself to retry it."}
{"text":"Hands down best Pho in this area.  I work in the Ft. Mill area and usually get my Pho fix from a certain Asian fusion restaurant in Baxter Village.  It never really wows me, but it does the job.  I have passed by Asian Roll & Grill several times, and after reading reviews I decided to give it a try.  My to-go order consisted of summer rolls and a small Pho Tai.  I was a bit disappointed with the portion size of the Pho for the price, but I would soon get over it.  As usual, the broth was given to me in a plastic container, and all of the noodles and fixins in a styrofoam box. Even rare, the beef looked and smelled amazing.  It was sprinkled with seasonings, and laid on top of the noodles.  Also in the box were the herbs, onions, sprouts, lime, a small cup of hoisin, and a small cup of chili oil.  I could not wait to get back to work as the delicious smells filled my car. The first thing I did was taste the broth.  AMAZING!  I already knew I was in for a great experience.  I added my beef, noodles, onions, sprouts, some hoisin, a dab of chili oil, and OMG...I was in Pho heaven.  I almost forgot for a minute that I had another tasty treat waiting for me.  The summer rolls were fresh and delicious...and the peanut sauce was EVERYTHING!  I am thoroughly pleased with my lunch, and now I am ready for a nap.  Not to mention my white shirt is now littered with Pho-speckles. Asian Roll & Grill will definitely be my go-to for Pho in this area."}
{"text":"Now that I have eaten here several times, I can say that this restaurant is truly amazing. Every time I have eaten here everything I have tried has tasted great. The summer rolls, pho, vermicelli, miso soup, and sushi are all delightful. Out of all the places I have tried in the Fort Mill area (this excludes Charlotte), this is by far the best Asian food restaurant and has the best sushi. I have never been disappointed here, and neither have any of the friends and family I have brought along. The service is also very good. They have even changed the decor since I first ate here, and now it looks lovely as well."}
{"text":"For a rare Vietnamese from Orange County, CA visiting the South Carolina area I found the alternative from burgers, BBQ, and fried chicken very refreshing.  After days of just dense caloric meals, stumbling upon this place on a Sunday evening was a God send.  I got the brisket pho noodle soup and it was surprisingly VERY good.  It was on par with what you would get in Southern California or Little Saigon.  I know it might sound hard to believe.   The broth was piping hot and well seasoned with earthy aromas.  My girlfriend got two sushi rolls which she also  thought was fresh and delicious.  We also shared a fried gyoza appetizer and was pretty darn amazing too.  Dinner came out to $40 for 4 items.  So for you folks wanting to try some great Vietnamese food, this will hit the spot.  Oh yeah, it's healthy too!"}
{"text":"THERE WAS A ROACH IN MY PHO!  I was already miid way finished with my soup until I realized it. When I told the waiter, he laughed and then just didn't charge me for my soup.   Will not be going back there. Ever."}
{"text":"Got sushi for family and vermicelli noodles with beef and spring rolls.  All was Below average at best !! We spent over $100 and the sushi was fishy tasting- not fresh and vermicelli was bland.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I always come here for the sushi. The Godzilla roll is amazing! My only wish is they would have specials on their sushi, like a buy one get one. Or something. Some of the sushi is very pricey but it is very good."}
{"text":"We enjoy the sushi and noodle bowls. We have seafood allergies and they are very accommodating. The decor is nice in both the bar and restaurant areas. It should be noted that the restaurant is closed mid afternoon."}
{"text":"I love Pho! Asian Roll & Grill had the best made-from-scratch Pho, it actually feels healing to eat the Pho here-- it is amazing.  The sushi is also very good and the service is good. I would eat here every single day if I could!"}
{"text":"They offer a really nice presentation of food on the plate, and obsequious staff ready to help with anything.  Since I am not qualified to review sushi, I will stick to the teryaki chicken and fried rice.  It was pretty good, with a balance between sauce and chicken.  The rice is also good.  I will not rank it close to teryaki on the west coast or even in Nashville.  But for Tega Cay, it was adequate."}
{"text":"Asian Roll & Grill is the swiss army knife of Asian / Southeast Asian cuisine. If you're in the mood for Sushi, Udon Soup, Pho, Fried Rice, or several other eclectic selections, then this is your place.  Their appetizer selection is hit or miss. The Calamari is mostly fried batter, while the Summer Rolls (Spring Rolls at most places...) have always been fresh and delicious.   For the main courses, my wife and I have tried a good cross section of their food. I wouldn't put their Pho as the GO TO #1 item on the menu. Honestly, I'm a huge fan of their Udon Soup with Beef, which comes with a hearty helping of vegetables and sautéed beef. Add in a little chili oil and you're in flavor country.  Their sushi is OK. It's one of those things where might order a roll to split while having something else. If my wife and I are ever in the mood exclusively for Sushi, Asian Roll & Grill is not in the rotation.  Some have mentioned, the service is hit or miss depending who you get. We've had fantastic service and we've had bad service.   All in all, we visit Asian Roll & Grill pretty regularly and enjoy the food every time."}
{"text":"A man who took her order did not speak enough English to understand what we ordered so when we got home we got nothing that we had ordered and what we did eat tasted absolutely horrific. Thanks a lot for nothing and it wasn't cheap either."}
{"text":"The pho is unreal. \"Craveable\" was a word used in an earlier review and that's absolutely right. Like, wake up at 3 am craveable. The flavors are fantastic. The service is very good, you can tell they try very hard to please you and make sure you enjoy your visit.   I've had the fresh summer rolls which are fantastic. I've had the tempura sweet potato, which is awesome. But I keep coming back for the pho. I haven't even tried anything else on the menu for my main dish.   As I'm typing this I realize I'm going to have to pick some up for dinner, because now I'm craving it again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more authentic Asian restaurants in the Fort Mill Area, but the portion size are be low average."}
{"text":"They have thee best sushi I have ever had!  I LOVE their stuff!  And the service is great. Very nice people.  I think it is a family owned business?  Which is really neat.  You will not be disappointed in whatever you order!"}
{"text":"Nice food.... The quantity is a little less but quality is nice and the service is good... They serve food quickly and hot which is good if you are really hungry"}
