{"text":"La Boulette's version of a \"hot chicken sandwich\", made with duck (obviously). It intrigued me when I saw it on the menu and the waitress' description only solidified my decision to order it. Braised duck covered in a sauce made with the porcini braising liquid, fries, coleslaw and lastly, awkward peas for formality.  The duck was tender, the sauce sweet and the portion very very generous as it sat on a toasted brioche bun. Just the braised duck in the bun drenched in sauce was almost a meal in itself. I would have liked to bitten into bigger chunks of duck, but having been braised for so long, the break down of the meat is understandable. Besides, this way, they don't really know how much they're actually giving you... Shhhhh."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy space with friendly service. The calamari were mediocre but the salad and burger were good. We will come again for tartare next time."}
{"text":"Reasonably price burger joint in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie. Their bleu-ermite burger might be the best burger they have. If you just want to stop in for a drink, you have to order something to nibble on and I would suggest their calamari, which are nicely fried and have a nice tang to them."}
{"text":"Ça vaut le déplacement.  Pas seulement une place à hamburgers.  Au menu, tartare, fish & chips, steak frites, poutine avec cheddar doux ou vieilli, confie de canard et quelques salades et j'en oubli.  N'hésitez pas à l'essayer."}
{"text":"On a picture perfect Sunday afternoon, we ended up in La Boulette.  The place had been recommended by a neighborhood local.  Sitting in the outdoor tables, we chose a Salmon burger with Caesar Salad.  Also ordered was the gravlax and salad.  This was accompanied by a combo of frites that included sweet potato. I am not keen on big portions so was very content with the gravlax.  Just great.  But the special moment was the frites.  Having lived in Belgium for some years, I know how addictive frites can be.  I would suggest that La Boulette is as good if not better than any Belgium establishment.  They are that good.  I had been told to order the poutine.  I am sure they are phenomenal.  But  go with the frites. The salmon burger was (as expected) to big for my appetite.  But it also is absolutely incredible.   Service was excellent.  Prices very reasonable. I wish we could transport this place back to my New Jersey town."}
{"text":"Vraiment d'excellent burgers!!! Les calmars sont succulent, les tartares sont bien relevé!! Les frites sont croustillantes et la mayonnaise est vraiment bonne!!!"}
{"text":"Le tartare de boeuf et le burger Beaubien étaient excellent! Service impeccable, ambiance chaleureuse et festive."}
{"text":"Amazing food. My fiancé and I flew in today and we're staying near by and had to stop by. We got a chicken sandwich and one of the burgers and it was to die for. Their poutine was incredible and the drinks were amazing. Our waiter was understanding of our broken French and was happy to explain anything we didn't understand. One of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Restaurant with a cute and cozy atmosphere, friendly staff and fast service.   I stopped in for carry out during the early evening hours. The place was quiet, peaceful and a nice escape from the rain. I ordered the beaubien burger with fries and a salmon dish with fries for my girlfriend. My girlfriend said she really enjoyed the salmon dish, which she claims was refreshing and unique. We both thought the fries were good, however I felt my burger was a tad dry. I recognize however, that it took some time to return home before I actually ate the meal, so this could have been the reason. Otherwise the meal was great and I would recommend this to anyone in the mood for some comfort food."}
{"text":"Belle place a Burger sur la rue Beaubien. Sans être les meilleurs burgers en ville, ont sent quand même un beau travail autant dans la composition que dans la qualité des aliments les composants. Juste pas frappés la parfaite la recette magique pour mes papilles. Mais j'y retournerais certainement pour explorer le menu plus en profondeur."}
{"text":"Decided to stop for lunch and my friend suggested to check out this street since there's a lot of spots to eat.  It was a Tuesday afternoon very warm so we wanted a terasse and that's what we got. Big patio with lots of umbrellas to hid us from this crazy fall weather.  We started with the pickles, they were only okay not what I was expecting. I didn't like the Panko and not enough pickle !  My salad fries and burger were good, salad was a mix of sliced onions and cucumbers with a mixed salad in a sweet dressing. Burger was juicy. Only thing I didn't enjoy was the little mayo you get to choose for your fries it tasted like Rene Cesar. Boyfriend got the fried chicken salad, he said it was okay the fried chicken wasn't a good idea apparently lol but when I went to try it, it looked really soggy.  Our waitress wasn't very quick but I wasn't in a rush so I didn't care, the place was a nice new spot to check out and I'm glad we did.  UPDATE: The food made us sick for 2 days, really wasn't happy expecting that and for that reason I will have to change my review from 3 - 2."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They sell good tartares (I LOVE tartare!), it's affordable plus, the service is great and the waitresses are always super sweet. I ordered the duo tartares, which comes with a generous portion of salad and a side of fries : you can either take the potatoes french fries, the sweet potatoes or a mix of both. It's like having the best of both world! You also have  one dipping for your fries and they have like 5 or 6 dippings to chose from. I personally like to dip mine in the \"dijonnaise\". If you're not that into tartares, they also have burgers, poutines and fish and chips."}
{"text":"Tiny place but worth  the wait ! Wonderful juicy burgers . Yummy sweet potato fries . My friend had the fish and chips and it was a large piece of fish with a tangy dipping sauce . Give it a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here for a burger and fries the day before yesterday. It was recommended to us by a good friend of mine who comes here often. She was right, the food was very good! However, I was surprised to see that the prices were so steep, particularly for this part of the neighborhood. Also, it is very rare to see a burger place where your burger is served à la carte. I didn't realize that we needed to order fries separately until our burgers arrived solo. My daughter decided to have a dessert at the end of the meal, and so, without looking at the menu we both ordered the pouding chômeur. I was surprised again when I paid the bill and I saw that the pouding chômeur was $8 each! That is easily 2x more than what I felt it was worth. And if La Boulette insists on charging that much for it, they should rename their pouding chômeur to ''pouding pas chômeur.''  All in all, a tasty burger place, but make sure to bring your credit card. We did not drink alcohol (just water), no appetizers and we each ordered the basic classic burgers with the salad and a dessert and our meals came to $35 each after tax and tip. Woozer!"}
{"text":"I love small quaint restaurants full of charm, and La Boulette is the epitome of just that. It's just too cute! Not only that, but the burgers are fantastic! Lots of options, visually stunning, fancy, tasty, everything you can think of! The place is rather small, but I tend to like that kind of thing. The decor is engaging. The service was great. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Cute burger restaurant. Have never been disappointed here. This restaurant doesn't seat many and given its location near the theatre, it tends to get packed! Not suitable for big groups. The burgers are well cooked and flavourful. Lots of choices of patties from beef to lentil to lamb and salmon! There is something for everyone here. I've brought picky eaters here who have enjoyed their meals. Not only do they have burgers but they have salads, poutines, salmon, steak, tartares and calamari - most of which I've tried and enjoyed. Order an extra side of sweet potato fries. They're the best I've ever had! So light and crunchy! Prices reasonable for the quality. Excellent service every time."}
{"text":"Great cozy restaurant. Went on a Wednesday night and it was packed. Great service friendly staff. Good was great. Definitely need a second visit to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I went yesterday to this place and I get gastro !! For my first time it's such a bad experience  Never GO again"}
{"text":"J'habite le quartier depuis 2 mois seulement. Première fois à La Boulette, et je reviendrai. J'avais besoin d'un petit snack de milieu d'après-midi et je suis bien tombé. J'ai pris l'entrée de tartare de thon, très bonne, ainsi qu'une petite frite avec mayonnaise coriandre/jalapeño, très bonne aussi. Les frites sont croustillantes et la mayonnaise goûtait quand même le jalapeño, ce qui est bien. Cependant, comme plusieurs petits restaurants à Montréal, les serveuses oublient souvent de venir à la table vérifier si tout va bien. J'étais assied à la terrasse et ai dû me lever de table, me rendre à l'intérieur et demande un autre petit contenant de mayonnaise coriandre/jalapeño, qu'on m'apportât de sitôt avec sourire et courtoisie. Je recommande cet endroit et reviendrai pour un repas plus complet."}
{"text":"Great cozy little restaurant!   My friend and i loved it. We both had the tartare duo and we were satisfied with our choice!  Service is good, the staff is nice and polite.  I can't wait to go back and try one of their burgers!!"}
{"text":"Note: this review has been sitting in my drafts for a while (somehow I hadn't noticed it wasn't posted) so might not be super up to date. My visit here was months ago, I can't even remember when.   I have trouble deciding whether or not I would come back. It wasn't bad at all but I'd say my experience was a little inconsistent throughout.   However, unlike some of the previous reviews, the service was impeccable and one of the highlights of our evening (come to think of it, considering some reviews, this might support my statement on inconsistency). We came relatively early on a Saturday evening so it was pretty quiet went we got there.   We shared fried calamari, which was quite good. However, we all hated the mayo/sauce that came with it (not that any self-respecting calamari would need it). Don't remember seeing the description of it on the menu but there was something in it (couldn't put our finger on it) that we simply didn't like.   I had a tartare duo of salmon and tuna. That's the most pronounced discrepancy I encountered that night. While the tuna was perfect in every way: fresh fish, delicately cut tartare, wonderful arrangement of flavours, the salmon was just not up-to-par. The salmon was drenched in so much sauce I couldn't taste the fish and couldn't tell if it was fresh. Also the tartare cut was sloppy compared to the tuna which made it a bit mushy. If I'd had the tuna tartare only, I would've easily given an extra star to my review.   I enjoyed my salad but one of my fellow diner mates was drowning in dressing.   Fries were so good. I had the mix of sweet and regular potatoes. Both were so delicious! Great great great fries! And the accompanying mayo was pretty good. Jalapeño and cilantro was the best I tried (to my surprise as in other places I usually prefer the Dijonnaise)."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, nourriture toujours fraîche, goûteuse et délicieuse! Le pain des burgers est excellent, les frites sont croustillantes à souhait et la mayonnaise est succulente. Tout est bon dans le menu, et les prix sont bas! Personnellement mon endroit à hamburger préférée!"}
{"text":"Must try hamburgers! The fries are awesome. Unfortunately they don't accept reservations in the evening so except to wait in line, specially in more than 2. Very good and quick service . Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Un petit bistro sympa situé sur Beaubien, près du croisement avec De Lorimier, un quartier sympa. Une carte agréable avec des prix abordables et les burgers sont tout simplement délicieux. Je vous le conseille."}
{"text":"I am on a mission to discover my neighbourhood and La Boulette came recommended by Yelpers and the Internet, so there I was on an evening date.  I will always try a fried pickle entrée, and I gladly report that theirs is great! The massive pickles are sliced, which is the only way a pickle should be fried I believe. La Boulette is very big on mayo, in any order, even entrées, you are given a choice of mayo. We tried the pulled pork poutine and the goat cheese burger with both types of fries. Now. Now, THIS is inspired! Do you want regular fries? Sweet potato? Can't decide? Grab 'em both! The poutine was very heavy, and that's all I can say from one bite. My basket was the burger's and I had a lot to say about that burger. The meat is great, the seasoning is great, and all of this is my problem: the meat is lamb, really heavily seasoned lamb. Combine that with goat cheese and you have a pungent burger. Overpowering burger. It wasn't bad, but it was a statement that my Friday night may have done without.   Should I have tried a tartare? Should I have tried the lentil burger? Did you know in colloquial France French a \"boulette\" is a mistake? Oops."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Highlights-  - Great burgers - Very fresh, nicely dressed salads  - Solid fries with an assortment of mayo  - Pleasant sidewalk seating  - Quick service, even during a busy time  This restaurant could date my daughter if it were a person and I had a daughter. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"Tres bien just doesn't cut it. So I found this place in the Canadian newspaper while visiting Montreal for Jazz Fest. The review sounded good, so being that we were unfamiliar with much of the city, my friends and I went for it. And boy were we glad. I think I remember chowing down on Le Burger Beaubien (house burger) and a nice Carlsberg pour moi boisson over some thunder and heavy rains. This thing was huge and juicy. Lettuce, bacon, gherkins, cheddar, tomato and mayo. Had to slice mine in half to not choke. The service was memorable if only for the fact that the French Canadian waitress was very patient with a host of Americans fluent in Frenglish. That was appreciated. She brought menus in French and English. Cute space, but not at all huge. So don't even think about rolling in there with more than 5 deep. You'll be disappointed. You just gotta try this place. C'est magnifique!"}
{"text":"Nourriture très bonne .. Que ce soit le tartare de buf ou le burger à l'agneau... MAIS un service plus que déplaisant par une des serveuses ! Pour une table à deux personnes je me fais demander dans combien de temps l'autre personne arrivera et aussitôt assise l'autre personne a dû commander et regarder le menu pendant que la serveuse attendait ! Et ce même s'il y avait au moins 5 tables de vides et aucune file d'attente! À la fin du repas après le paiement de notre facture - elle est revenue pour nous demander si on voulait quelques choses et si on avait fini avec la table !! Mais il y avait au moins 4 autres tables de vides et aucune personne qui attendait !!!!! Désagréable !"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place! Small, quaint restaurant that is very attracting to visit, especially during summer when they open the front window-door - always smells heavenly.   Choices of burgers are outstanding. I love the concept that you see how much every dished is priced with every type of side order (fries, sweet potato fries, salad, both, etc).   Everytime I went, the burgers were succulent. My sister, however, had the chicken cesar salad ,and even I was disappointed in it. The chicken was succulent, but the salad and dressing weren't top-notch.   I'm not a fan of the fries, it may be the oil. I also didn't enjoy the chipotle mayonnaise. On the other hand, I tried the house salad another time and that was great.  Overall, will be going back for sure. It's a cute place that is a great place to bring guests and company."}
{"text":"C'est un excellent choix pour le rapport qualité -prix ! L'ambiance est sympa, possibilité  d'être assis à la terrasse. Le service est bien et rapide.Le menu est simple mais assez varié! Les aliments sont frais ! Un vaste choix de mayonnaise vous est proposé. L'endroit est facilement accessible. Je vous le recommande"}
{"text":"Tout est parfait le burger au saumon et champignons délectable frites au patate douce ecoeurante biere cheval blanc. A essayer beaucoup de fois belle decouverte!!"}
{"text":"great place for burgers! I highly recommend trying the fried chicken burger. It's made with fresh chicken and this is definitely something that is evident in the taste. Delicious sweet potato fries. Cocktails are decent and it is not too expensive to eat here . Good service and they don't take too long with your food even if it's packed.  All in all I gave this a 4!"}
{"text":"Pour le moment, le meilleur restaurant de burger que j'ai visité sur Montréal ! Chaleureux et accueillant, l'ambiance est parfaite ! Les burgers sont délicieux et tout est soigné. Des condiments jusqu'au pain. Les frites sont succulentes et même le choix des mayonnaises faites maison, est appréciable. Je me suis régaler de l'apéritif au café, qui aussi passage, était un vrai expresso Italien. Merci pour cette découverte et je reviendrais aussi souvent que je le pourrais!"}
{"text":"Excellent bistro à burgers, sympathique! Inventif, goûteux, bondé."}
