{"text":"Ok, for an $8.50 large pepperoni pizza it's ok, you'll have to add garlic salt or something to it, it's a little on the bland side, a little greasy, if you have kids these are perfect to throw at them. If you want something tasty in the area, spend the extra dollar and call Rocco's on monday night for their 9.99 pickup special. On a 1-10 for pizza this pizza from express was about a good 4, not bad but nothing to go back for again."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and I still have not had a bad meal from here. The delivery driver is always polite and gets my food here quickly. I recommend   Triple Decker Club, Gyro, or Chicken Cheesesteak, I am sure the regular cheesesteak is good too. I was only disappointed with the Caesar Salad, not because it tasted bad but because lettuce and croutons are not worth 7 bucks. Every other meal I have had is definitely worth the money though and they do not skimp on the food. I really like this place and I will continue to be a loyal customer for years to come. I have not had a bad experience with food or employees here. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"have you ever been aroused by food?  I have, and Express Pizza touched me. They give you a lot of food for the price. They don't joke around, I tried to make them laugh and they're very serious about filling your belly. Their wings are good and their pizza is better. they have too much variety...and that's good."}
{"text":"sucked....
   This is unfortunate because its extremely close to my house.
 But, service sucked delivery person spoke no English to the point he didn't know the phone number to call in and square away the order.
 we called back & gentleman or lack there of persisted to scream, and hung up phone..   Well, my food went back and hungry I still am."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery many times, and tried several different things. The food is consistently high quality and delicious.  The menu has such variety and so many great options.  You cannot go wrong with Express Pizza.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese pizza and zucchini sticks for delivery.  After about 55 minutes, the delivery driver arrived and handed me a small bag (with zucchini sticks) and told me my total was 20$.  I asked him where the pizza was? Because he had no pizza with him! He called the restaurant and spoke italian back and forth on the phone and then told me he left the pizza in the car.  I waited while he went to the car and he came back empty handed still!  So then he told me that he must've left the pizza on top of the car and drove off, and that he would have a new pizza made and come back... so 30 minutes later he came back with my pizza and still took the $20 instead of giving me a discount because of their weird mistake. Bad customer service... Aside from the weirdness, the pizza and the zucchini sticks were pretty good, but after that happened I don't think I'll order from here again..."}
{"text":"Our theatre group had 2 performances on a Saturday, and decided we would order pizza in between shows. Our production manager contacted Express Pizza at around 10am to get things rolling and price out an order. After speaking with the cast, she got everyone's order, and called at around 1pm to place an order for 6 large pizzas to arrive for 6pm. This should have been very straight forward. As it was, when 6pm rolled around, 3 of the 6 pizzas arrived. All 3 deluxe pizzas were missing. Our production manager had the delivery man phone the restaurant to see if the pizzas were still at the store, but apparently they were never made at all. So half of the cast didn't get their dinner in between 2 very demanding musical performances. The delivery man was also very rude and not at all helpful in trying to remedy the problem. I will NEVER order from here again, and I don't recommend anyone else do so either."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE !!! I got 20 wings and no buffalo sauce and when I called they were very rude and told me there was sauce when I took everything out the bag there was none. The lady was extremely rude and they did nothing to correct this mistake. Never ordering here again im livid. Disgusting sauceless wings. Not worth my 5 dollar tip"}

{"text":"I called in to order delivery I ordered the family special which was priced at 18.99, when the total came to $27.50 I questioned it.. suddenly there was a language barrier. I asked to change my order to two individual dinners because if the price difference. He quoted me $24.50. The driver arrived and was trying to charge me the $27.50!! The driver had no phone and then also conveniently forgot English. So I called the restaurant where we proceeded to do math and he suddenly got angry! I'm not about to be yelled at about food, I hung up on him. . Worst customer service ever. My food went back with the driver and I ordered somewhere else. I don't care how the food is the service SUCKS and I'll never order here again. 
PS this is the smokiest place I've ever seen, you need an oxygen mask just to get in"}
{"text":"The service was good they delivered quickly but the pizza itself was below average. The sauce was flavorless and the dough was a little undercooked, softer than I like.  Good sausage but that's all that I liked."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie pizza, came on time for a great price for something with no flavor. Cheese had a plastic consistency and the crust was bland. Sauce was also very plain. It seemed like the vegetables even forgot how they're supposed to taste. 

Fried zucchini was good though, whatever they did to the zucchini they should do to the pies."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp so here it goes... 
The food is good and close to home. They are open late AND deliver. I love their chicken wings and all the food is reasonably priced, good deals but the Customer service is HORRIBLE! That is why I decided to start yelping lol The Woman who works here is so rude. So if it wasn't for that I would probably give 5 stars."}

I get it. Its late and want to get home. ANSWER your phone then and tell folks you aren't taking anymore carry out orders OR adjust your vmail greeting to say the kitchen isn't taking anymore orders.

Will NEVER order from this location again"}

{"text":"I have ordered from here numerous times now and they are always prompt and accurate! Not the mention delicious! I love their pizza and wings!! I agree with everyone else and can't agree with the low stars. Love express pizza."}
{"text":"Express Pizza, not to be confused with the Pizza Express  known in Europe and Hong Kong, mine and Eddies favorite pizza place in Hong Kong. In Toronto this is Express Pizza and it is the original pizza place in the village. Pizza Express \"owned\" the market for a very long time in the village.  It will be sad if the heat in the kitchen gets too hot for them with all the new pizza options in the village,  but they also had a head start and if they delivered a good product, they will have no problem.  Its the one I would usually go to when in the village and need a snack, and it may very well be the best in the area but not the best to be had.  Did pizza express deliver a good product or did they leave the door open for competition, time will tell."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I ordered two lunch specials and specifically asked for ranch sauce. When my order arrived, no ranch. No ranch, no ketchup, no napkins or utensils... (btw I ordered lasagna and cheesesteak sandwich with fries.) I called the restaurant to ask if it might've dropped in the drivers car? But the lady who picked up my call was so rude!! She said I never ordered ranch. She said there's a brown paper bag with ketchup and utensils inside my plastic bag with the food. When I mentioned that there is no brown paper bag. she rudely and blatantly said \"well, you're at home right? You should have utensils. And I'm not having the driver go back for 3 packets of ketchup\". Here's the thing, I never wanted or expected someone to come back with \"3 packets of ketchup\" or anything else for that matter. I just wanted to know if it might've fell inside the drivers car! Wow. This lady was belittling the situation by emphasizing \"3 packets of ketchup\" over and over during the conversation without allowing me to talk or get a word in edgewise. If she had just allowed me to finish talking this situation wouldn't have escalated to this. You just lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"Would have given them 0 stars but my fiancé ordered gizzards and a gyro, which he said were very good. His chicken wings...not so much. And I ordered their white pizza that comes with an olive oil sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, and parm. I added spinach, tomatoes and garlic. Asked them to leave off the ricotta but add feta instead, which they did. Pizza arrived burned on the edges and VERY DRY. And there was no garlic because it would have added flavor to this otherwise bland and cardboard pie. I called the restaurant and told them I was not happy with what was delivered and could they please try again. That request was met with an absolutely not response!! She said they sent me what I asked for, the pizza was not burned, and they would not replace the pie. And with that, she hung up on me!! Would not recommend this establishment to anyone who expects something edible to be delivered. And it wasn't cheap!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back corner of Bounty Hunter you will find Express Pizza. You enter a dark tiny room maybe the size of a little closet, 4 or 5 people maybe, ring a bell, and wait for your doom. Really felt like the beginning of a horror movie, and no one knew I was here. 

A nice maybe elderly lady, blame the lighting, greeted and helped me out with the menu, lunch specials, and time it took to finish. They have a pretty good menu at reasonable prices from pizzas, calzones or strombolis, ribs, pastas, gyros, salads, subs, wraps, burgers, chickens, and more. Breakfast lunch and dinner. 

I ordered the 16\" one topping pizza (Italian sausage) for $7.95. Tasted pretty good I have no complaints. The crust wasn't thick like Chicago or thin like NY but was OK. Didn't take a long time to make maybe 10-15 mins, all good sat in the bar area watching sports on the numerous flat screens. 

I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu. I really didn't want to copy and paste the entire menu so you can find it here http://www.usmenuguide.com/expresspizzamenu.html"}
{"text":"I love this place so much I've been ordering from them for about 2 years the food is amazeballs"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, when I opened my front door and saw their menu laying on the ground I figured this was just another run of the mill pizza joint that would only cater to my late night drunk escapades when my taste buds have no sense of right or wrong.

To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. I mean you can't have high expectations for a place named Express Pizza. Another confession, I\"ve never tried the pizza (next on my list of things). 

So here's how much I like this place...I tried one of their lunch specials on a Saturday, seven days later I've eaten them two additional times. That's how friggin good it was. 

This place has a variety of lunch specials available 7 days a week. Major points their for not limiting their deals to midweek. First time up I tried the Lasagna lunch special after asking the lady taking my order if that was a good choice. She advised me that I \"wouldn't be disappointed.\" I wasn't. The sauce was terrific, pasta cooked perfect, just the right amount of cheese. And for $6.50 it included a canned soda and piece of garlic bread (which was great for dipping). Next time out I ordered the Gyro (since my wife said it was amazeballs when she ordered it for lunch). Outstanding. PIta was so fresh, meat was filled with flavor. Tuh-zee-kee sauce, because I have no friggin clue how to spell that mess of a word, was awesome! I'm not a french fry guy, but theirs were seasoned perfectly and I ate a load of those. Third time up I ordered the Lasagna for dinner which included a salad. 

Had I ordered the food when I was drunk I probably would have wrote Mr. Michelin himself and requested he consider this place. Instead, I'll just call it an outstanding hole in the wall delivery joint located inside the Bounty Hunter bar. Two giant thumbs up."}
{"text":"Tried and True.

This place is a relic-- it's been there as long as I've been here-- well over a decade. This low-pro, slightly sub-street level enclave, set among a slew of other businesses on the streetfront, has but one thing on the menu: Pizza.

Slices go for about $3.75, and are \"Pizza Pizza\" size. It's always fresh, and free spice is provided on the countertop. There's no place to sit in the approximate 15x15 ft ordering space and commoners are often seen lounging about on nearby staircases outside the shop, and along the edges of the inside of the restaurant, eating, standing against ledges.

This is a late night place. It's definitely THE desination for revellers spilling out bars at 2. I've ordered a pizza from this place at 6 AM, even, and I don't think I've seen it open for lunch ever. The chalkboard menu is classically defiled every time the staff rewrites it: For example, \"Crab\" mysteriously becomes \"Crap\".

Despite the shoddiness, I haven't found a reason to stop going here for late night bites yet-- and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"I called this place as a first time customer and I had a few questions!!Omg the lady was so rude!!I could not believe it!!!I will never call this place again!!!Always be nice!!Pizza hut just got my $40!!!Rude BITCH!!"}
{"text":"Order pepperoni pizza and it was delicious and wings as well ! Everything was an delivery service they were fast and food was hot an ready. Very decent pricing. Would definitely recommend other people and would likely order all the time."}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend this place at all!  I had placed an order from these people because they were the only place open early in the morning, and man do I regret it! They never confirmed my order through eat24 so I requested it to be cancelled, which to so surprise there was no response either! So guess what comes knocking at my door at 11am? These guys! I had fto order from a different place  and me thinking it's the people I reordered from and gave them almost $30 when my first order was only 17.. When I called and let them know I didn't want their order anymore all they said was \"you got your order, so it was confirmed!\" Uhh NOO I can show you the text I got that the order was left unconfirmed since they could not reach you! Now I'm stuck with two orders, one that I'm not going to eat and I'm out $30.. Very rude people."}
{"text":"Placed my order around 3 p.m. And I swear not more than 15 minutes later my order arrived. The driver seemed to be Russian or Eastern European, he was very nice and friendly, but I could tell he was in a hurry. That's understandable, considering how quickly he got my order to me and I appreciated that.  So as far as speed of delivery, I give them an A plus. I was really disappointed in my lasagna. The sauce was runny and liquidy and had no consistency to it at all.  It was like tomato soup. There wasn't much cheese on my lasagna and not much inside and I felt the portion was very small compared to other restaurants. The side salad was typical for this type of place so no complaints there, and the garlic bread was really good. Just how I like it, lots of butter, not over baked or burnt, and soft. I got carrot cake for dessert and it was pretty typical of this type of place.  I may try them again, because the delivery was so good and the garlic bread, salad and dessert was fine. But I would try another entree next time."}
{"text":"Great food, cheaper than other places, quick, nice delivery person. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food. There wings are delectable. I always love their food and they are pretty fast for delivery. Thanks again for some amazing food! Definitely recommend for first timers!"}
{"text":"Grabbed two lunch specials for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Absolutely worth the $6.50 each. Ordered via Yelp and picked up at their side area inside the Bounty Hunter bar. They honored my special requests (dressing on side, add lettuce and extra peperoncini). Gyro and fries were tasty- garlicky taziki sauce tied it together. Antipasto salad was very large with plenty of meat and cheese but lots of veggies too. Soda came in 12oz cans. Will be back to try more lunch specials."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden jewel. They are actually located inside of Bounty Hunters. But I can assure you they are worth the hunt. There specials are extremely economical and the taste for the price is even better. 

The ordering process was interesting because of the accent on the other end. Russian maybe bulgarian, I'm not really sure. All I know is that I was expecting italian and got nothing near that UNTIL I TASTED IT YUMMM.

They made sure to give me the best special available without me asking. Who doesn't enjoy saving some coin. The portion sizes are large and well worth any money you'll spend.

The pizza was flavorful and had really fresh ingredients. The spaghetti was tasty but needed a little bit of parmesan. However the meatballs were perfect as is. The hot wings were some of the best that i have tasted in this area. Not too spicy but you got a good taste of the flavor. French fries were seasoned well, but don't let them sit too long. 

This is a true mom and pop shop thats serving solid dishes at a reasonable price. I say give 'em a shot."}
{"text":"My buddy picked up a pie this afternoon. I would like to forget about the experience, but my taste buds won't let me. Got their 16\" pickup special, half pepperoni, half cheese. The crust was tough and dry, except from all of the grease from whatever cheese they used. It basically had no flavor, except for some kind of spice it had that I'm still trying to figure out what it was. I wouldn't waste your time getting a pizza from here. They are located in a bar, so maybe if your drunk enough, it may not be as bad, but probably not."}
{"text":"I love the food here great customer service The Stromboli is off the chain sol delicious wings and fries is great!! Just awesome!!"}
{"text":"I got home one day and one of their menus was at the door. Ordered and here's my experience:

The lady who answers the phone is not very well-versed in customer service. English is obviously not her first language and the way she responds when she doesn't understand you just comes off rude.

The pizza was undercooked, the wings were greasy w/no seasoning, the fries that came with them were cold and rubbery. The breaded mushrooms were ok although too much breading."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place. Just received a flyer on my door step and thought let's try this place. Called to have it delivered and the amount came out a lot more than I thought. After asking for a breakdown she was quoting prices more than the menu I was given. I told her the price was different and she gave an attitude that the menu was old. Terrible customer service. Won't even bother with the food it would have given me a bad taste in my mouth. 

If you care about customer service don't go here. If you don't care how you are treated or talked too then go ahead."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them 5 times and it got worse each time so I've given up on them.

My last order was lasagna.  I've had it from many places so I was disappointed when the container was smaller than any other restaurant.  And then when I opened it, it was only half full.

Plus, most places send 2 big pieces of garlic bread.  This had 2 tiny pieces.

Never ordering from them again.  Maybe if I want a burger, because they are tasty, but probably not considering how disappointed I am with their pizza and lasagna."}
{"text":"Surprised how good this pizza was. 16\" pepperoni pizza was excellent and only cost $8.50! This is a steal. Cooked perfect, good amount of cheese and pepperoni. Very well seasoned. I will make this a regular stop. Pizza was ready for pick up at dinner time in just 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I think I've ordered like cheesesteaks and other sandwiches from this place and they were okay, but I ordered a stromboli from there today. I order delivery a lot, so I try to kinda mix it up on grub hub. Well, I forgot that I had actually ordered stromboli from these guys once before and it was terrible. As soon as I bit into my stromboli tonight, I immediately remembered how bad it was the last time and knew I was out $20 again. Before I get into the specifics of the food, let me state that this place is 1.4 miles from my house according to grubhub and it still takes them 55 minutes to get here (which would be \"whatever\" if the food was cooked, more on that in a second). I do want to say the delivery guy is super nice, always thanks me when I include a tip online. Really nice kid. That's pretty much the last positive thing I'm going to say in this review. 

So, back to the food. The stromboli was EXTREMELY undercooked, like, still doughy undercooked, and the taste, I can only equate to being a ridiculously high amount of yeast in the crust, or just flat out mold on one of the ingredients. I think it was the former, which is the lesser of two evils, but still left me doubled over praying to the toilet within 10 minutes or so. It wasn't even JUST the crust that had that flavor. After a few bites of that, I tried just ripping it apart and eating the meat out of the middle and just everything had that taste: the cheese, the meat. It was literally inedible. I threw it away after forcing down about 5 bites. Then proceeded to get sick. I still have the taste in my mouth. 

Check your dough recipe's guys, and if the crust is still white and mushy that means you didn't cook it long enough! I'll stick to sandwiches if I order from them again, and that's a big if."}
{"text":"We had once again waited until the local restaurants closed for the night while trying to decide what to eat for dinner.  The bf began searching the late delivery website and found this place.  $2 delivery charge.  We expected another random late night junk food take out place meant for people too drunk to know the difference.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I ordered the Gyro and a side of spaghetti for our son.  Bf ordered Philly Cheesesteak and fries and fried zucchini.  The side salad actually came separately in a different bag, not wilted as feared.  They gave us plenty of ranch and blue cheese dressing without extra charge.  The Gyro was pretty good, came on fresh pita bread.  The spaghetti was ok.  The bf enjoyed his food.  The website had saved the address of the last hotel we had food delivered too over a year ago and no one had called to verify so the delivery guy was lost at a different location...he was a good sport about it while the female owner called to blame us for our mistake.  Decent food, and if we decide to order from them again, we will definitely remember to update our address!  For being such a good sport, we gave the guy and extra tip on top of the delivery fee."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for the past couple of month now. Their pizza is pretty tasty, but what always keeps me coming back is their Burgers and Fries. Very juicy burger, with a good size helping of some tasty fries. Also, the delivery person that they usually send is a very nice guy, very polite, too. The only downside I have come across is their wings. They do not add any sauces or seasonings, which isn't that big of a deal to me, but might be to other customers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Their family meal is perfect! It comes with a 1 topping pizza, chicken tenders, chicken wings and a 2 liter drink... all delicious. We always have it delivered and it is still hot when we receive it. There is enough food in the meal that we have leftovers for days! So yummy and the staff is super nice. :)"}
{"text":"Meh. It was late night , cold, so I looked on the net who still delivered at 11pm or later.
They gave me this place. Seems to be located in The Bounty Hunter bar. 
My review is solely on the food. Even though the lady on the phone wasn't the nicest, I felt like i had to go out of my way to be nice to her so she can be nice in return. Hate when i have to do that fake shit.

The price wasn't bad at all around 12 dollars for a large cheese only. 
Got a small order of wings , seems they come with fries. Total was 24.00
They are close to me and the price isn't high. That really didn't matter though because the pizza was very bland. The cheese had no taste. Pizza gets eaten within a day at this house, and pretty much the whole thing is still left over from the night before. 
No taste at all... Like at all... Tastes like bread with cheap cheese on it, plastic cheese.
The wings weren't anything special, I hate when they aren't cooked thoroughly and that squishy fat part is still on them. Fries a bit soggy.

Sucks cause its close to me, they deliver late, and the price isn't bad. But the food quality is why the prices are so low. Too good to be true. Back to getting my late night pizza from Putters."}
