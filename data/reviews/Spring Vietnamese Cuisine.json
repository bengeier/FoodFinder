{"text":"This place is pretty good. The deluxe Pho broth had a good taste, there was a good balance between the noodle and meat. The fried spring rolls were also good. The service is quick and friendly. The restaurant is clean and modern. Overall a good impression, would definitely return. Way better than Saigon anon, which was here before."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, yet we were not offered any tea or beverages. so we asked for colas. We ordered the shrimp salad appetizer and vermicelli with chicken, beef & shrimp and vegetables. Our entrees arrived in a reasonable time and were large portions.  Unfortunately, the taste was bland and the vermicelli and veggies were coated in oil. About half way through, our server brought a water refill, yet did not offer a cola refill for my hubby's nearly empty glass.  Then 3/4 through, our order-taker came to ask if we got our salad rolls. No. So the appetizer arrived when we were about finished dinner.  A disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"Food is good and average price. Satisfies my craving every time. My children really enjoy it as well"}
{"text":"Came here with my volleyball team after our game at Rallypointe.   I find the selection of Asian cuisine in the deep south to be limited so Spring was a welcome surprise when a teammate recommended them for post game noms.   We arrived 40 minutes before close and they happily accommodated us. I had the pho tai and I'm happy to report the broth was hot and rich, and noodles were plentiful. The vegetable toppings were fresh as well.   As far as service is concerned, it's no different than any other Vietnamese restaurant in town. The server grabbed our orders, dropped off our food, and went away somewhere. He wasn't seen again until it was time to pay.   The prices were reasonable but a bit more expensive due to the lack of competition in the area. If anyone else can recommend a decent Vietnamese restaurant in the deep Southwest, let me know! Otherwise, Spring is a decent choice but not my first."}
{"text":"I love ordering for delivery here because it's quick and free delivery on orders over $30 but to eat in here is...... slow.... basically the service sucks.   Food is very tasty and seems fresh. Gluten free options available on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and never had a bad experience. Great vermicelli, spring rolls, wings, egg noodle dishes and rice dishes. If you want Vietnamese this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Unfortunately although my food looked very delicious I got food poisoning from my pho. It did taste super delicious but the aftermath was quite horrible. I won't be eating here again due to the food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I ordered twice from here off skip the dishes in one week! Everything I ordered was delicious each time I ordered their satay pho and their normal pho and personally liked their satay pho more. I also ordered their milk tea with lychee jelly which was also really good. Their deep fried banana was ok I prefer the spring roll method more than the battered way they make it."}
