{"text":"Amazing burgers, great prices, good location. Thanks, Michael Symon!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Laid back and had a pickle bar! We had milkshakes with added libations! Service was fast and friendly. I had the philly melt burger! Yum! Been looking for cheese wiz since my trip to philly!"}
{"text":"Unfathomably disgusting burgers on both occasions I gave them a try.  I don't understand what all the hype is about.  The first time I went, I got a burger.  I don't recall which type.  It tasted like whatever charred material was stuck to the grill.  I couldn't take more than two bites. The burger literally tasted like whatever was burned onto the underside of a grill. Soot and a not-quite-right meaty flavor.  Since I had a gift card, I decided to give them one more try, because hey, everyone's entitled to a bad day once in a while. I regret this decision.  I got a burger with some sort of basil cream cheese on it.  Again, the burger tasted like the burnt underside of a grill.  Absolutely, positively, the most disgusting burger I have ever had.  The toppings were fine; the burger was crap.  I had a side of fries.  They probably would've been good if they weren't cold.  A little overseasoned if anything.  A burger almost anywhere else is guaranteed to be better."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers. I got the Smasher Special (andouille, slaw, provalone, and sriracha mayo) and was amazed that I was able to take a bite and set it down. At most joints, this burger would have been too messy to pick up and put down.  The fries are matchstick-style and are good, but get cold very quickly and make it tough to dip in the variety of homemade sauces present on the table.   The pickle bar is excellent, but it would be better if there were little dishes that you could use to gather the pickles you want. Instead, you must parade your plate with your sandwich around the restaurant.  If you have nothing else at B Spot, you must have a milkshake! Specifically, you must try the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon milkshake. Sounds strange with the bacon, but it is something I will crave. Take a chance on it!"}
{"text":"Visited this place on the way home from an obnoxiously long road trip where we desperately needed to be out of the car.  It was a good choice I think.  First off, we got there at happy hour, which while we weren't drinking so we didn't get to take advantage of those specials, the food specials were awesome. I got a burger and my fiancee got a brat, both of which were pretty good.  My burger was cooked perfectly, however it had pulled pork on it which was dry.  The coffee BBQ sauce at the table ended up providing some moisture and an extra burst of flavor.  My fiancees brat was the same way, but he jacked it up with some stadium mustard, which IDK if it's made in house but it definitely packs a flavor punch.  The fries were good, almost like a shoestring variety but a good crunch/soft ratio, and when you throw some of the chili and actual cheese (not the awful plastic variety) they become a delightful guilty pleasure.  My only complaint was the shake.  I was feeling adventurous and got the apple bacon vanilla shake and tossed a shot of bourbon in it (and I LOVE bourbon, thank you Pulp Fiction for making me ever consider the idea of bourbon in a shake, but I have grown to love it in the right application).  It was not good, not even a little bit, and I'm not sure if it was the type of bourbon or if I just really didn't care for the flavor profile, but either way I wouldn't try that again. They have 'rules' about building your own thing but frankly, they have worked hard at creating the flavors that they have and securing their brand with them so I get it.  They aren't condescending about it, they are just there, and it does help you sort of get out of the box with what you're eating which most of us need from time to time.  I liked the decor, definitely a masculine feel but what do you expect from a place focused on burgers, brats and bourbon.  A bit louder than I tend to care for but it looks like the outer door can be opened in good weather, which is a super cool feature in my opinion."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food while eating it, however it seemed to be like clockwork for our whole party, 4 hours after eating made you want to throw up. It ruined our evening events. Also I think that it's absurd to automatically add 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Most places only start to include gratuity after 8 people and at 18% to split the 15-20% debate. It's as if we are tipping them for their inability to handle more than six burgers. I believe that the servers would be more enjoyable if they actually had to work for their money using their personality."}
{"text":"Honestly I went here because the name: Michael Symon.  It's basically a build your own burger bar.  The meat was disappointing.  Small parties that were formed too tightly.  This made the meat tough and chewy.  The pickle bar was five star.  As were the sauces they offer.  Rosemary fries didn't impress either.  The concept is good and resonates well with me,  the execution of the meals was a let down though."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but the menu lacks. Would be great to see more options. Love the pickle bar : )"}
{"text":"Oof, completely underwhelmed.  I'll address the food first as I'd hope folks are coming for that and not because it's part of the Michael Symon cult of personality.  Having come from Chicago where they do some amazing burgers (Kuma's anyone?), perhaps my expectations were a bit high.  Honestly though, the burgers at a place like Rally's are WAY better than here.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium and it was about as dry and tasteless as something that'd been sitting under the heat lamps at a turnpike rest stop restaurant.  From reading other reviews, the inability to cook a burger correctly seems to be a pervasive issue.       Also ordered the Lola fries since they sounded delicious on the menu, but a big 'meh' there as well.  Oh, one other thing, their website acknowledges everything is cooked in lard, but it's not mentioned anywhere on their actual menus at the restaurant.  Not a problem for me, but if I hadn't checked ahead of time and then re-confirmed with the waitstaff, my vegetarian wife would've been severely disturbed to say the least.  Not that a vegetarian would make this place a destination, but they could be dragged along as part of a bigger group like she was.    They plop down a cart of sauces to throw on your burger or dip with your fries, but nothing exceptional there.  The manner in which the waitress presented everything on the table ties into another distasteful problem reflected in other reviews, the whole 'you're lucky to even be sitting here' mentality.  If you're gonna pull that shit, you damn well better deliver.  The overbearing rules posted everywhere and arrogance, even though they're situated in a freaking suburban strip mall and serving subpar pub food, is laughable.  Next!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I like Michael Symon and it was one of the places I still remember eating at while visiting a friend in Cleveland. Had the Lola burger - I've recently discovered that an egg on top of stuff makes it better. They had a pickle bar with a bunch of different varieties, which I thought was cute. The portion was perfect for me, but I'm known for having a small stomach so it might be small for others. All together, it's one of the most unique burger places I've eaten at."}
{"text":"Our waitress deserves a special award for her patience with our indecisive (and dare I say, finicky)  table!  She was very helpful educating us on our choices and gave great recommendations.  We were a party of four (mostly) adults and two kids and we were all quite pleased with our appetizers, burgers and salads.  (I know, who goes to a burger joint and orders a salad?  The one who orders the chocolate milkshake with toasted marshmallows and a shot of dark rum, that's who!)  Some in our group were a bit too cold for their preferences -- probably as a result of sitting next to an exterior wall of mostly glass with air vents overhead -- but any discomfort was worth the experience.    This isn't a place for a quiet, romantic conversation, but I'd be comfortable recommending it for a casual date, family, work or group event.  Be prepared to take a pager and wait 20 minutes for your table!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for the quality. We've tried 3 different items and all have been disappointing. Good atmosphere and ok service but for the price, wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Catching up on reviews and noted I have been here a couple of times recently.   I have to blow this place up as now I have sampled a few of the items.   Going in you MUST be aware this is a burger joint. Do not go here for much else food wise.  Yeah the fries are good and the wings are OK (sauces average).   The burgers though are simply the best. The reviewers that dont like them are eating them too fast and have been cultivated on Mickie Ds.   Forget that the condiments are all home made and could be eaten alone as they are so good. Try the sasha sauce or balsamic steak sauce. These are the kinds of flavors you get at his top restaurants, typically not a burger joint.   The meat....Locally produced I think. Not sure of the percentage of fat but is is a perfect combination. The taste is heavenly. Often hidden by the large range of accompaniments the sandwich comes with. The Lola burger has fried egg, applewood bacon and pickled onion (i omit the onion on this one). Do yourself a favor and save a bite with just the meat with maybe a bit of sauce. The texture should not be overlooked as well. Most burger places will squeeze teh burger which makes it tough. I have not had a restaurant burger made correctly where the texture is perfect silky like.   Being a beer freak this place gets good marks the cain and able by two brothers is good stuff. The PBR for $2 reminds me of stealing my dads beers.   Would be 5 stars but price hurts, rent causes this I am sure. Great people watching on patio and beer can collection is almost as good as mine.   Love mr symons works!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try this place. Unique burgers, great fresh ingredients and really cool toppings! They have a pickle bar with interesting flavors of pickles, pickled veggies, and even kimchi! Shakes are amazing as well and their beer/liquor list isn't lacking either! They even put a little booze in the milkshakes if you ask! Fries are among my favorite with a little rosemary and sea salt.  Service, however, can be hit or miss which is why 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"We stopped by for some burgers. A Lola and a Thin Lizzy. The burgers were good. I've had better. But where a great joint shines is in the sides. We had the fries. Awesome! And the Onion Rings, to die for. How did you get the onion to stay in the ring after biting it? Even my wife noticed the onion rings were special. Using the balsamic steak sauce on the fries and rings was amazing! But the absolute kicker was the Chocolate Shake. Now that was the best I've ever had. We are looking forward to returning the next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"You've heard it before and I'll say it again: Vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake with a shot of bourbon.  GTFO.  I am sad that they got rid of their Reuben burger because I thought it was phenomenal.  As a substitute I opt for the Lola because I love a fried egg on top of just about anything, or the Kojak, which has gyro meat, if I'm feeling squirrely.  Truthfully, all of the burgers there are great.  The meat is juicy and flavorful and the buns are always soft and fresh.  They do offer more than just burgers.  They have fried bologna, chicken wings and brats.   I got the fondue once and I don't see myself ordering it again in the future.  It wasn't bad necessarily, but I could still taste the rosemary the next day.  I kid you not, it was insane.  They have an awesome beer list and a wide variety of booze drinks, lots of whiskeys, which I appreciate immensely.  Every time I've been there the service has been courteous and fast.  The biggest problem I have with this place is the cubby hole of an entrance way that gets backed up during peak hours, or at any time there are more than 6 people waiting for a table.  My boyfriend is a burger freak and he has stated many times to me that B Spot's are his favorite.  I suppose it is a little pricey considering the burgers come solo, but that's why i docked them a star."}
{"text":"I came for beer week beer and possible food.  I've had their burgers before and they're great.  Came in @4pm and it was pretty empty with a handful of people at the bar.  Was seated right away at a dirty table...  waitress ran and got a towel and wiped table clean.  Again, it was empty here.  Inquired about beers and the waitress didn't know much...  did mention the special beer of the day - I got one.  Beer event online stated a special burger was available, but never pitched.  I drank the beer and left.  I said bye 3x as I left, even pausing for the last one, and the waitress never looked... too busy chatting with another worker.  Sad day, but will come back for solid food...  and it was happy hr $3 beers too!  2 stars for bad service."}
{"text":"I went to the B-Spot for the third time yesterday - my third and final attempt at realizing the hype of this pretentious, arrogant \"restaurant.\"    I attempted to order a simple cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato, american cheese... and grilled onions.  B-Spot has some odd rules; all food must come out together, only complete parties will be seated, and no menu changes may be made.  My request of grilled onions was rejected in a manner so rudely, I refused to offer my patronage to this establishment.  The standard cheeseburger order comes with lettuce, tomato, and raw onion; the waitress refused to allow my request of grilled onion.  I offered to order another item on the menu; which had lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and cheddar cheese - I was not allowed to sub out cheddar cheese in preference of American.    When I told the waitress my request, she acted as if I was ignorant - stating that \"Michael\" has spent a great deal of time creating the best possible combinations for his menu, and since he knows best, that is the way it will be best.  Nevermind the minute differences and compromises of my order - \"Michael\" knows best.  Upon telling the waitress I would not eat at a restaurant with such poor customer regard, she continued to try to belittle me with a smug attitude while my friend followed through with his order.    B-Spot is not a place I would recommend to any true burger fan, even before this sour encounter.  The approach is pretentious, the staff is arrogant (and overweight/putzy), and the food is average at best.  I have been to Symon's other restaurants (Lola, Lolita) and they do not live up to the hype with their limited menus and forced atmosphere.  I have been to world class restaurants, nationally recognized burger joints (Thurman's in Columbus, anyone?), and everywhere inbetween; B-Spot is forgettable.  The attitude and atmosphere of the restaurant further diminish the experience.    If you want a true gourmet burger, go to Moxie.  If you want a good greasy burger go to Five Guys or Fatburger."}
{"text":"Cleveland rocks. Great beer great service amazing burger and fries. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I'd much rather pay $10 for a Thin Lizzy burger ($7) with a side of Lola frites ($3) than $9.99 for a cheeseburger with fries at Applebee's. Plus, there's a pickle bar. I cannot stress that enough. It's a wonderful thing. Also: fried bologna! As for the whole \"no substitutions\" debate, if going one meal without making a special request (unless real dietary restrictions are involved) gets you ALL CAPS upset, then you've kind of proved Symon's point re: whining."}
{"text":"Very good, fun atmosphere, solid food offerings to be expected from a burger joint. In the early afternoon we sat at the bar in the busy, very small restaurant in a very upscale shopping center. I can't remember all that we tried. Just that it was solid examples of to-be-expected food - onion rings, burger, sausage and a truly superior shake. We also ... ahem ... caught sight of Mr. Symon himself."}
{"text":"The Porky Burger at B Spot is one of many great burgers at one of Cleveland's best burger joints. Topped with Carolina style vinegar, BBQ pulled pork, coleslaw, Cleveland BBQ sauce, and bacon. Coming on a fresh toasted bun and dripping with flavor, this burger has a flavorful beef patty and some tasty pulled pork. The single disadvantage may be that the burger is a little unmanageable; however this was a fun mess. B Spot also serves up several other great burgers by the creative Chef Michael Symon. Add in some great sides, fun decorations, and flavorful beer for an easy success."}
{"text":"Recently got the husband to go w/me to try the B Spot.....we should have kept it movin to Swenson's..if I'm eating in the car I expect flies around my food, indoors not so much. I witnessed a cutomer stick the bottle of sauce on the table damn near up her nose to smell it...WTF??? The pickle bar, yeah bad idea, esp when cutomers pick thru and sample right at the bar, YUCK."}
{"text":"A must eat when in the Cleveland area!! While visiting family in the US for 2 weeks we had yet to visit a good burger joint and my we came upon the right one just before our trip ended!  I ordered the Gobbler but with a veggie patty and it was finger-licking good! We all ordered various kinds of burgers and everyone was very satisfied with what they had! We also shared fries and porky fries for the carnivores (they all love those!). The \"salad bar\" is also pretty cool, you're able to add in some extras such as pickles, etc. Milkshakes look pretty awesome too but are probably crazy filling so I didn't even attempt to fit one of those in!  Service is good enough (they don't bug you too often but only come by your table enough to refill drinks) and food comes out in good timing even when they are busy. Only downside is that you aren't able to exchange the patties on the burgers, which is super annoying being a vegetarian, yet, you do still have a ton of options to be able to build your own burger.  As a note, my boyfriend only likes burgers but loves this place--he said it's his favorite burger joint he's been to--ever!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I discovered the elusive b spot with my girlfriend and all I can say is that we left this place fully satisfied.  .. but seriously, great burgers & awesome service. Love the decor."}
{"text":"How could anyone give this place less than 4 stars? Iron chef. Excellent burgers, fires, shakes and rings. And a pickle bar. It's money. A Cleveland tradition."}
{"text":"A CHANGE for the WORSE...Changes to the Turkey Burger take my five star rating down to a four star. I LOVED LOVED the flavor and texture of the B-Spot's original Turkey Burger. It tasted fresh, full of flavor, and went perfect with all of my favorite toppings from the build your own menu. I experienced the new Turkey Burger yesterday while dining in Strongsville with my family. Eww. The texture was sort of rubbery and seemed more like a patty you would find in the freezer section. The flavor was bland too. The waitress said that they were still buying the burgers from the same place but that they did change the consistency and they weren't using the same spices.   MICHAEL SIMON, BRING BACK THE OLD TURKEY BURGERS PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, nice (not too big) portion sizes and a laid back atmosphere.  We are fans!"}
{"text":"If you order a burger, you only get a burger. Now I don't mind that, but what I do mind is that you got a small burger for $8, not a big one. I had a burger and some fries for lunch and was still a little hungry afterwards. If I ordered a burger and fries for dinner, I surely would still be hungry afterwards.   The burger itself was ok, but as stated above, was on the small side. The fries were nothing special, but they were kind of expensive. $4 for 1 side of fries? That seems a bit pricey for me.   As for the service, it was very good. They had obviously been trained a lot.   The only thing that really stands out to me is that you can't add anything to your burger. I mean nothing! Any burger, no matter how much stuff is on it, should come with onion, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. But not here. What you see is what you get.   Now even though there was this \"rule\", I wanted extra onion. Raw onion, not the pickled stuff that came on my burger. Much to my satisfaction, our server was nice enough to give me some. So good job to our server.   Now I went to this Michael Simon restaurant and expected it to be amazing. It wasn't. It was just... Well... Average."}
{"text":"Food is solid. Nice choices. Good quality. (4 stars on food).  I consistently have less the spectacular service there. I am not certain why. I am not expecting anything unusual, but 90% of the time I leave there feeling like I was bothering them by being there. I keep going back because the food is good and I want to support local, but really they should address the culture and attitude."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  Primarily a burger joint, but the flavors are top notch.  It's about $15-20 for meal, but the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow shake more than makes it worthwhile.  My fav burger is the Yo:  provolone, coppa, banana peppers, Tony Packos sweet hot pickles, and the Lola ketchup.  Ohhhh boy...I need to go back .immediately!"}
{"text":"One day I ordered a shake & unfortunately, there were chunks of bacon in it. :( I don't eat pork. The manager was very forgiving & the service was great. However, I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, I had a horrible experience. Of the 4 burgers we ordered, all of them came well done when we asked for medium rare. So we sent them back. Also, we asked for an order of the Lola fries without the rosemary. The first order came with rosemary. We sent those back too. After everything came back for the second time, the burgers were still over or under cooked, and the fries STILL had the rosemary. The manager did the right thing in comping the whole meal, and they also have us a gift card. Around a year later, the gift card still sits unused. Don't have any intentions on going back."}
{"text":"Went to the b spot tonight with my parents and my girlfriend.  Our standard for burgers is pretty high.  We've been to Michael Symon's other restaurants and think very highly of his cooking so we expected greatness.  All in all, it delivered.  I had the brueben (a burger topped w/ a rueben sandwich), my girlfriend had the thin lizzy (topped w/ housemade pickles, mayo, cheddar and grilled onions), my Mom had the fat doug (topped w/ a pastrami sandwich) and my Dad had the standard bacon cheeseburger.  All were delicious.  Burgers cooked to order on point, though we all got medium.  Perfect amount of pinkness.  Toppings were well thought out and high quality - the onions were grilled to golden brown, the bacon was crispy.    Oh, and did I mention the pickle bar?  I consider myself a pickle connoisseur.  The dills were great as were the banana peppers.  Bread and butter aren't my thing, but great compared to the jarred ones.    Also, the sauces were a fun and interesting touch. 6 in all, from hot pepper sauce to coffee bbq to lola ketchup to balsamic steak and the standard ketchup and stadium mustard.  They were great as burger dippers.  Also nice to douse on the seasoned lola fries and onion rings.    Michael Symon knows what he's doing when it comes to burgers.  It's no Kuma's Corner in Chicago, but definitely a top 5 burger in all I've had.  Just be prepared to wait a while for a table at peak times.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Seems like an overpriced place for mediocre burgers...  If you can't cook a good burger at home this is your place."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the other locations of B Spot many times with my friends & family. Always enjoyed the food. Put our name in Sat. afternoon for a 20 minute wait at B Spot Westlake. Chilly outside, so we waited BY the front desk. Couple came in with their child & knew the Mgr. They chatted for a few.  We were the next to be seated.  We saw the list!  But NO!  Mgr. proceeds to have his friends seated NEXT, then proceeds to MOVE them to a better table!  My husband pointed out that on their wall it is stated that you will be seated in the order you arrive!  On their wall in BIG print!  Then the Mgr. lied to my husband and said that they came an hour ago...we heard AND saw the whole thing. The hostess said as much to us, and so did another diner!  As long as you know the Manager you DON'T have to wait for a table at B Spot Westlake. We Left!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you'd expect from Michael Symon. Quality gourmet burgers in the $10 to $12 range. Great atmosphere with available outside seating. Honestly....the pickle bar keeps me coming back. All you can eat Tony Packo's pickles? Please! Vanilla Bean Apple Pie & Bacon milkshake is a solid A++!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try The B Spot and had an opportunity to do so yesterday. I went to the restaurant about 1:30 pm. It was not busy at all, maybe three other patrons were at the restaurant. I ordered the atomic burger, no onions, an order of fries and water. I receive my burger loaded with onions which I removed- no big deal. The burger was ok ,nothing special and the fries were cold. At no point during my meal did my server come back to my table to ask me if everything was ok. I drank my water and had to actually grab my glass and head to the bar and get a refill. At the same time I told the bartender I would like my check. My check was placed on the table without a word from my server asking if I enjoyed my meal. Service was horrible. Servers were standing around in huddles talking,but were not checking on the few tables that had customers. Luckily I had the right amount of cash to pay the bill and walked out after paying. Would never go back. One of the worst restaurant services I've ever received."}
{"text":"Great location and great burgers.I have only been there once and I was courageous enough to try the atomic burger and it was totally worth it. It's not very spicy if you get the habanero sauce on the side. Habanero sauce was VERY hot but I loved it.  They have a condiment bar and kimchi was my favorite. What an interesting selection of condiments! Everyone else in my group loved what they ordered. We also got a side of rosemary fries and that was kind of disappointing. Service was very good."}
{"text":"It just does NOT make any sense to me that if you want their specialty burger but instead of mustard you want mayo, it is considered create your own burger and it cost you $3 more. Due to this policy and luck of common sense from the server, I am not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Damn good burgers. What more can I say. Chef Symon Kills it.   Be warned - milkshakes are for 2. Yet they are so good you can go through the bucket."}
{"text":"I'm generally not impressed by Michael Symon or Crocker Park or burgers with a lot of stuff on them.  There seem to be a lot of restaurants out there lately with a concept of selling burgers with crazy combos of stuff paired with giant milkshakes possibly containing alcohol, and I am more of a burger-with-onions-and-cheese person than burger-with-a-bacon-egg-and-waffle-breakfast-on-it person, so I figured this place would be just OK.  I was wrong.  The burgers are very, very good.    Even though I do not like burgers that are pink in the middle as the restaurant recommends you get them - medium well is as rare as I go. Even though the ones with combos of meat (a burger with BBQ pork on it, a burger with a pastrami reuben on it, etc.) are definitely not my taste.  Even though they cost 12 dollars.  Even though the restaurant, while containing some nice art, was uncomfortable - jammed with people, with an overly tiny table for the two of us, and not sufficient monitors for my friend to see the basketball scores (the only monitor I could see was directly over our heads, a dumb place to put it), and furnished in some industrial style with the type of uncomfortable \"design\" chairs and tables you expect to see in a museum cafe, and with insufficient surfaces to absorb the noise of conversation so it was like eating in a big echo chamber.  Even with all of that, the burgers were still very, very good.  You can build your own combination, but I wanted to try one of the specials.  Finally picked the New Jack City one which had pepper jack cheese and peppers but didn't go so far as to slap some second kind of meat or egg on.  I really liked it - it was surprisingly mild. The bun was also just a great hamburger bun - it was not hard to chew, or pretzel style, or covered with a ton of seeds which can be hard to eat without getting them all stuck in your teeth (or in the case of some of my family, their dentures).   There is a condiment bar with lots of pickled stuff including sweet pickles, which I like a lot, so that's cool.  And the Lola fries were awetastic as they were actually crispy shoestring fries, which seem to be hard to find nowadays.  They do have a lot of rosemary on them, which turned off my dining companion but I like rosemary OK so more for me.    The only food that was just sort of ordinary was the milkshake, which I guess makes sense since a milkshake is a milkshake and once you have good quality ingredients, there isn't much that a restaurant can do different from your own kitchen.  The milkshake was the size for about three meals, I will give it that.  But next time I'll probably have a beer.   A solid four stars.  If the restaurant was more comfortable to eat in, I'd give it five stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the Stadium brat and it came out a mess.  Overflowing with onions and drenched in stadium mustard.  I sent it back because it tasted like it had been on the grill for a week.  Second one came out only slightly better.  DO NOT ORDER THIS THING.  I also ordered a side of 'Rosemary fries' as well.  Come on rosemary?  You are supposedly one of the best chefs in cleveland and the best you can come up with is rosemary?  Thats home cooking 101...rosemary potatoes.  What a joke.  Never again. Bartender was nice though, she was very accommodating and understanding."}
{"text":"Always great burgers. Now that I'm GF, look at menus a whole new way. VERY sad the fries have a flour coating:-( Give me a GF option PLEASE; it's just too easy...... Thank goodness the waitress finally suggested a GF bun. Awesome. Hats off to the West Side Market Mediterra(sp?), GF Bun!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !!! ....burgers are small..fries are terrible...and management sucks...even though they  have call ahead seating if their busy they will just give your table away...and they close early most of the time..."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is by far my favorite Iron Chef!  So, two hours to Cleveland is a walk in the park.  Both my husband and I love to go on one-day trips to Cleveland to eat at his restaurants and the first stop is always B Spot.  You might ask \"what's so special about a burger place?\".  Well, try B Spot and your idea of burgers will change forever!    These burgers are the most rich, fancy and most gourmet burgers we've ever tried.  The combination of ingredients and flavors is out of this world!  Pair the Lola Burger with the Lola Fries and you have a marriage made in heaven.

{"text":"What a disappointment. Very average taste. My burger came and while looking great the bun was soggy and cold the meat was a little dry chewy and tasteless and the pork was lacking any stand-out flavor I would not recommend it based on value. The employees were responsive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome beer selection. Make sure to get fries and onion rings on the side because your burger does not come with this. Burgers are definitely the main attraction and have unique combinations. The Porky was awesome and the special of the day which was caprese was so good! I'm not a big meat eater but this was worth trying because of that unique combinations. I wish I would have tried the adult milkshakes but I was just too full. Oh! They also have great and unique sauces."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to indulging in a good, juicy burger and thought  we'd give this place a try. I should have known better, I don't get the whole Symon obsession. His last place in avon lake was so so, and both Lola and Lolita have been disappointing (on more than one occasion), I don't know why I thought this would be different.  Pros: happy hour pricing, we went early just to avoid the Crocker park crowd for dinner, had no idea it was happy hour.  So dinner was under $20 for two burgers, fries and tip.Rosemary fries are tasty and nice and thin. good music - unexpected bonus for westlake.  Cons: burger had no flavor, although it was touted as being local (good) and a special blend, it was blah. The lettuce gave it a bitter taste, and while the burger came out super quick, it was cold.   If I cared about price, I would have gone to two bucks, honestly I could get the sliders and fries for about the same price and they have way more flavor. Next time, I'll go across the street to Hyde park and get the burger at the bar, always tasty and about the same price, plus way better atmosphere if you're over 25 and don't want to feel like a packed sardine as you try to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"In love with this place. I'll give it 5 stars on the burger scale. I get the \"Porky\" which is just a regular burger with pulled pork and bbq sauce. It's always spot on. There Lala Fries with the Rosemary seasoning are always something to look forward too. Onion rings are HUGE. They also have pretty good milkshakes. I had a chance to eat at bobby flays place in NJ. Simon, you win."}
{"text":"Big Michael Symon fan. Vanilla apple bacon milkshake is life changing!  Service, though, was HORRENDOUS!!  7 employees standing (and sitting) between bar and kitchen area. Eye contact made but I had to approach them to place to go order.  Apparently the mice play while the cat is away..."}
{"text":"I went there this past weekend and was very pleased with the service. I'm currently on a dairy free diet (for my daughter), as soon as I told the waitress she went and pulled a list of all the menu items that included dairy.  This allowed me to quickly select and item and not be concerned."}
{"text":"Typical burger place, above average quality.  Great beer selection. I really recommend the Neapolitan milk stout. You can actually taste hints of strawberry.  I personally think it's pretty sting that you only get a burger and no side. If you want fries you have to pay for them. They are decent though--thinly cut and seasoned with rosemary.  I really dig the industrial decor."}
{"text":"We have gone to B spot many times but today's meal was very disappointing.  The sliders we received were very well done, which we were informed was the company policy.  If grilling the meat to the point of having no taste is the company's policy, then they achieved their goal.  The stale roll was the only thing we tasted.  If this was the first we went to B spot it would be our last time."}
{"text":"B-Spot is good, but by no means great.  I've been here about 4 or 5 times, and I've had some really amazing eats here, for example the bacon apple pie milkshake (perfect to share with your dog, by the way), but I'm really frustrated by how inconsistent the burgers are.    My burger is always cooked incorrectly, either way over or under cooked.  I will say that ONE time my dinner mate ordered the Symon Says, and it was one of the best burgers I've ever tried.  Cooked perfectly, juicy, and I never would have tried putting bologna on a burger at home, but I'm hesitant to return.    If the food was always that good, I would give this place 5 stars, but I seem to strike out every time I go.  I wish the line cooks knew how to cook the meat consistently and to order."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, service was good, food was average to below average. It's just not a great burger. I give it an edible so-so."}
{"text":"B-spot is a fantastic resturaunt, bottom line.  The area is a bit snooty and the residents are rude, which probably explains some of these reviews.  The service is great, we were in and out in under a half hour.  The beer selection is good but we opted for the milkshakes with bourbon.  Chef Symon really knows how to please people, just add a little pork to anything!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious, eclectic menu.  Wife had a Thin Lizzy, and I had the Symon Sez.  Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Wow. What a pleasant surprise! I was in town for my child's jump roping competition and was greeted with outstanding service. Upon arrival, there was the most exquisite decor and the BEST service I have ever experienced in a burger joint. Anna was wonderful as she was able to share her knowledge of jump roping. She didn't stop there, she \"double dutched\" and recommended the new jack city burger and a holly jolly (papa ended up having to call a cab). The whole experience was great! Highly recommend B-Spot!"}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago, in April to be exact and b spot was not bad. I think the rosemary fries is quite a unique idea, but the chicken burger i ordered seemed a bit dry. But, that's not to say it isn't good. If you haven't tried it yet, check it out.  I did takeout, so, for what I got, it was good.  The milkshake though, was great."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I do a lot of carry out from here. It is always right and fresh. The only thing is the fries don't taste as good at home. They don't travel well. However they are fabulous when eaten at the restaurant. It is my go to burger joint"}
{"text":"Average. Burgers pretty good. Service ok. Shakes are amazing. Cool atmosphere. Pickle bar is pointless to me."}
{"text":"B spot is a fun place to grab a burger or a beer, or both. Good for lunch and dinner. This place gets busy on the weekends and the wait can be too long for us hungry birds. Best chocolate milkshake anywhere!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a fun meal. After being explained the \"rules\"... which could have been pulled off in a way to be more funny rather than condescending and pretentious... we ordered. Got our drinks. Food came. They forgot my burger. Had to wait 15 more minutes for my burger. Fries tasted like fast food. Onion rings were okay. My friend asked for a glass of water. Never came. We both polished off our drinks rather quickly, never to be asked if we'd like another. Burger finally came. It was decent, but definitely not the \"best i ever had\".  On a bright note, I did love the coffee BBQ sauce.  Not sure if this place will make it. I know i won't return. At the end of the meal our server handed us a business card to look at her blogs. Now THAT was weird."}
{"text":"My wife and I love B Spot! We stop by any time we're passing through the area.  You can tell they use QUALITY ingredients - sooooo good.  We try a different burger each time, and we split an order of rosemary fries and a milkshake.  I know the apple-bacon etc. milkshake has quite a following, and it is good, but we're both crazy for the chocolate-banana-marshmallow shake.  We consider it the chocolate milkshake we've been looking for our entire lives.  It really is that good."}
{"text":"Good beer selection.  The menu is even broken down into beer style so it's easy to choose what you're looking for. Their menu consists of bar food, but all of the different burgers make for a unique selection. The food tastes good, too. And to top it all off, excellent service.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"After a day of snow tubing, the family was in the mood for burgers...we got a four top right by the door..drafty and a little cramped...I have sat at the bar before (without the kids) and found it much mor comfortable..a thin pizza and the yo burgers are both really good..we got the Lola fries, not great...the rosemary seemed a bit like medicine flavor towards the end..they are shoe string and I am not the biggest fan of them to begin with..kids meals were great and the tony paco's pickles at the pickle bar are the best...not to mention pickles are my sons favorite vegetable...service was efficient and proper for a Sunday evening...chocolate banana marshmallow shake taste like the one mom used to make when I had a soar throat....two kids meals two burgers, one order of fries...4 beers 60 bucks..Negatives..not overly comfortable but we got a bummer table...portions not that big and a burger is ala carte..qui will go back but the wife was not impressed.."}
{"text":"Took our party of eight, including four kids, here on a Saturday afternoon.  There was already a 30 minute wait at 5:00PM, so it must be good.    The first thing I noticed was that this place is loud, which is great when you have kids with you.  The service was very attentive and the input all orders directly into a mini-computer as you order.  This allowed our drinks to arrive at the table almost before we were done ordering.    My wife and I both had burgers, which were excellent.  You can tell they spend time to get the best ingredients possible and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Our boys both wanted bratwurst and they were not fans.  The brats seemed to be overcooked and were dry.   The bread was also hard and dry.  This may be preferred by some, but for the kids, it was an issue.  We also ordered some fries, onion rings and a vanilla brean shake.  All were excellent.    The only negative I can mention was that towards the end of the meal, we felt rushed to leave.  The check was already on our table by the time I took my 2nd bite and it seemed like our server was back to our table every two minutes asking if there was \"anything I can get out of your way.\"  (Which I translated as \"can you please hurry up.\") I know this place is popular and they want to turn tables quickly, but if I wait 30 minutes for a table and pay $12.00 for a burger, don't rush me.    Overall, this was probably the best meal I have ever had in a strip mall.  The decor is cool, the food was great.  I just wish we had been invited to stay longer."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I don't get it. While the beer selection is great, the burgers are 'okay.\" I would rather go to Miles Market, buy great meat and grill my own burgers. Not worth the time waiting for a table or the money. Pretty boring."}
{"text":"Much as I love Chef Symon, the Eton BSpot's plating, service & quality are disappointing. On a decidedly unbusy Sunday afternoon, the burger was cold & weirdly gray in color & the bar was out of one of the only 2 red wine choices. Server indifferent & didn't offer to adjust tab. Best burgers (and service) on the east side still at the Academy Tavern."}
{"text":"This is definitely the b spot to be in Strongsville, and after experiencing this place myself, I can see why!  The burgers here are not just good, they are outstanding!  I ordered the Lola burger, and all that I can say is yum on a plate!  Perfectly cooked, and topped with fried egg, this is not your typical burger.  I also ordered a bad a## shake, and it was so thick and creamy, this is how shakes are done people!  No worries for messy eaters either, instead of napkins, they give you an entire roll of paper towels!   This came in handy when I attempted to pour my shake into the provided glass, all I can say is cleanup on isle four!  Also at every table there are six different sauces to choose from.  After trying them all, hands down my favorite sauce was the coffee bbq.  Who would of thought coffee with bbq sauce, but it was so good, especially paired with the delicious onion rings!  They don't just serve burgers here either, there is a wide variety of menu items to choose from including sandwiches, salads, and sides.  There is also a cool pickle bar to compliment your meal, with just about every kind of pickle you could want.  The atmosphere is fun and the decor is very unique, right down to the red painted antler chandelier.  As for the service, our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.   The prices are a little higher, but I don't think $6 to $9 dollars for a burger of this quality is unreasonable!   Also the shakes and orders of onion rings are big, so we split them!         Overall, I loved it, and i can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. We are new to Strongsville and live close by. The burgers and onion rings are delicious and we like the selections of beer. They also have a neat pickle bar! This is one of Michael Symon's restaurants. Really cool atmosphere and the service was great."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was great! Only issue was that it seems to have turned into just another burger joint. It used to be one of a kind with \"rules\" and that made it special. Just not the case anymore. I'd like to see it go back to being a special place."}
{"text":"Ate here a while ago. Wondering if this restaurant wasnt a Michael Symon restaurant, if it would have half the good reviews it has.  Not impressed with the flavor or quality of the food and the service.  Not rushing back.  Very pricey for a tiny burger."}
{"text":"I love the Lola fries, chips with the cheese dip and the banana marshmellow milk shake!! The service was wonderful and the management staff was great too,they came by several times to make sure everything was delish. Cant comment on the burgers since i dont eat them!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places I have ever been too. Technically it's a Burger, Brats, Bologna and they do all three well. I've had the New Jack City, Yo, and Porky have been my favorite burgers here. I always get them medium so can't speak to any other style of making them. What I have ordered has been a pleasure to introduce to my tastebuds. There are many options to basically create your own and aside from that there's a little bar in here that has other fixings you can add free of charge like Jalpeños, pickles, peppers, or red onions to name a few. The sauces also get honorable mention but my hands down favorite is the Coffee BBQ.  The drink menu is pretty extensive as well. A good selection of craft and tap beers along with cocktails, wine, and BOURBON! Few things are more American than Burgers and Bourbon."}
{"text":"A really enjoyable burger.  I've been at the bar quite a few times, and every time it's equally excellent.  Bartender keeps a close eye to make sure you're served quickly, which is all that can be asked.  The burgers thus far have been excellent, and I've had each one of them.  The meats are always cooked to perfection (my preference is medium-rare), and the combination of flavors is savory.  Pickle bar just tops it off, with everything from the sweet flavors to kimchi and spicy.  Always a good way to unwind."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Burger spots I've ever been too. They need to get one o these in Jersey. First off they hav liquor license to go with great burgers. Then the brats are delicious. Try the fries fried in duck oil."}
{"text":"First time here. Server was friendly and new menu well. French Onion Burger was the bomb. Need to try the Fat Doug Burger next. Look forward to going back with my kids."}
{"text":"A perfect ending to our weekend trip to northern Ohio.  The Lola burger was awesome!  The vanilla apple pie with bacon shake sounds weird but ooohhhhh so good. Thick shake with real bits of bavon and apple pie.  Ive never seen a straw that was shaped wide enough to sip a thick shake like theses. The chips were crispy, warm and plentifully with the dipping cheese sauce. My Husband got the special burger of the day had basil, tomato, and mozzarella.  He said it was good. I didnt get to taste since I was sitting at one end of the large booth that sat eight and he was at the other end. We were with a group of three kids and five adults.   He also got the onion rings and the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow shake. Something about the toasted marshmallows on top really makes this a bad a** shake. The service was good. Even when it was brought to the staff attention the the two little ones were waiting on thier cupcakes that was part of their meals from the kids menu. They offered the whole table a cup cake each. Most of the adults passed but the kids were happy."}
{"text":"Burgers were GREAT! The onion rings FANTASTIC, but I truly did not think the Lola fries were very good.   Service was sub-par as well, and when I went it wasnt even that crowded. I think they could do better, but are slacking and think thats ok because of who the owner is, which if they keep that up less and less people will go.  If you like unique things on your burger, I would go, but if you are looking for something normal I would stick to Winking Lizard or Red Robin."}
{"text":"Fathead's Headhunter is back on tap at Woodmere Bspot; I will visit again.  Plus keep the Bell's Two Hearted and the Rogue Chocolate Stout"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but service was horrible! Food was good but have had better and would have been a 4 rating except for the service. Our server stopped by the table twice-one to get drink order, second time for food order and then disappeared until we received our check. Food came out fast and correct but without proper customer service-will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Affordable. Delicious. Nice selection. Great beer list. Good location, especially in the summer. Recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger spots!  I used to love their happy hour with $5 burgers, $1 Lola fries and on tap prices, but they recently changed that and I'm sad about it!  They also took the wings and soup off the menu as well as the chili fries.  My husband loved the tomato soup with blue cheese and I enjoyed the cilantro lime wings, but alas no more! But the burgers...fantastic!  The meat is soft and cooked to your specifications, the toppings fresh and the pickle bar is awesome.  The milkshakes and fries are fantastic too.  Hubs is a big fan of the Kentucky Bourbon barrel ale on tap.    My favorites are the Lola burger and Thin Lizzy burger cooked med rare.  I love the vanilla milkshake and Lola fries.  I've tried the Gobbler (turkey burger) and it was just ok..not a big fan.  They used to have a mushroom burger called \"the why?\" But I see that is off the menu too..it was good.   Overall, we keep coming back!  It's a fun and tasty place to hang out and eat a great burger."}
{"text":"Their fries are yummy! I also love their apple bacon shake :P"}
{"text":"Rosemary fries are terrific, Pickle Bar has interesting choices.  Servers are confused, whike had dinner, food was brought to the wrong table three times.  They do understand \"rare\" which is a treat."}
{"text":"I have to go with a 4 here because I can't give 1/2 stars, and ...the service put it over the top for my wife and I.  This was stop 1 on a long day-trip we took to Cleveland today from the Detroit area.  The menu is limited, but ...it's just a burger and lunch place.  We had great recommendations from our waitress Sandra on a beer to start, and my wife picked the Lola burger, and I had the Fat Doug, along w/ a starter of onion rings.  Both our burgers were cooked great, and had a bunch of flavor!  It's a \"trick\" burger place as we called it afterwards.  Is it the best?  No, but they're good if you're looking for something just a bit different.  Oh, and they DO have a plain-Jane burger too if you want.  The onion rings were perfect, and we had the coffee bbq sauce to go with them,...perfect!  It was a great start to the day.  Go, ....expect a trick burger place, enjoy, and ask for Sandra!"}
{"text":"I'm a Five Guys kind of girl, but every once in a while, I like to go \"gourmet\".   I like my burgers with lots of toppings and so this place was a hit with me. They also have a separate pickle bar if you want to add even MORE toppings after you get your order. How can I not be in love?? We had some sides as well, but I really only liked the Lola fries.  This location is not my favorite since it's in the middle of busy and obnoxious Crocker Park. But, it's practically down the street from home, so I can pretty much pass out right after eating, so I can't really complain.  Unfortunately, I can't eat here any more since I missed the fact that everything is cooked in lard and that's a dietary no-no for me. Oh well. Ignorance is truly bliss!"}
{"text":"Some of the greatest burgers I have ever had. Shakes are crazy but good. And I love those fries. (Something about their ketchup & BBQ is amazing too)."}
{"text":"I gave the B-Spot a second chance and I was not disappointed.  The food was much better this time as was the service.  The fries came out crisp this time, not soggy, and most importantly the burger was cooked properly."}
{"text":"I wanted to be impressed.  Food was good but failed on the wow.  Service was fast and attentive however the emphasis ways on fast (turning tables) rather than wow.  Guess that while I wanted to be impressed, I wasn't."}
{"text":"Burgers and milkshakes are top of the line here, not a huge fan of the Lola fries or the bill, but definitely a great place to stop in every once in awhile"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the whining about the portion sizes! Go to a Golden Corral buffet if you want all you can eat. This is part of the obesity issue in America - you don't know a proper portion size when you see it. That said, the burgers here are still larger than the recommended portion.      If you want excellent, great-quality food, go to B Spot. The burgers are more than I can comfortably eat, but I also down most of the incredible Lola Fries with it. The Pulled Pork is fantastic, and I'm from the South, so I know my pulled pork. Michael Symon is the Master of Meat!     While there is no outdoor seating, when the weather is nice, they roll up the front wall, a sort of garage door, so it's an indoor-outdoor experience.      B Spot uses the best available ingredients, and cooks them perfectly.  The beer list is a revelation;  reading the cocktail list is entertaining, as they each come with a story. I will go back often, and happily drive from Lakewood to Strongsville."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as I expected based on the hype. Burger was good not great. Fries fair at best. Onion rings were good. Milkshake was awesome. Service was okay. If this was a $10 meal (burger, fries and shake) I would give it a 4 to 4.5 out of 5. The meal was $20 so I have to go 3 out of 5. I will go again but I'm not sure anything will change."}
{"text":"Always a treat to go there. My daughters favorite burger spot.  We travel over 45 minutes to go. I took my youngest and her two friends who have never been and like always B Soot didn't disappoint. My daughters two friends couldn't get enough if the Lola fries and bad ass shakes. So good. I had the Lola burger and a Morimoto beer along with the Lola fries... Perfecto! The servers are so friendly and accommodating. Some of the best I've seen. I wish they had one closer to akron / canton. I think Chef Symon would be pleased."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Burgers were small over cooked. Very over priced for amount food. Very disappointed in Simon I will not be back."}
{"text":"been a few times now and i am so impressed with the prices, thanks for the consideration. such quality and i can go often to enjoy one of the gems that michael symon calls his own. love when local chefs stay local and attainable. we are lucky to have him going in so many directions here!  so far i have tried the pulled pork sandwich, i felt more compelled to try this first rather than a burger. as impressed as i was with all of the sauces on the table to try, it really didn't need a thing. perfect size and flavor and i was thrilled to find a pickle bar- nice touch! our server was super enthusiastic and knew what he was talking about. fries were great with rosemary and sea salt. skinny little fries in a paper cone, more novel than substance but perfect to share.  on the second visit, i tried the reuben burger and really can't wait to try this one again. both times, i ordered the lemonade. i consider myself a lemonade expert and make my own at home all the time with vanilla beans and simple syrup. this had it's own charm and i could have drank a gallon of it. Friends enjoyed the wings and o rings.   the decor was totally masculine, to be expected, and it carried over touches of the now closed bar symon. old beer can collection on the wall in the shape of the letter b, looks like some tattoo inspired murals on the wall but yikes, the music was so annoying. i know that expecting everyone, everywhere i go to have the same rock and roll standards that i have is way to much to ask or expect but the music was so laughable that it was the main topic of conversation throughout our whole meal. i was practically praying for micheal symon himself to walk through the front door and go directly to the manager on duty and smack them for ruining appetites on an audible level. but i will let it slide, enjoy my food and shut up! i was hoping to see some merchandise to pick up, i know there are some great t-shirts out there designed by voo doo monkey's natalie roelle, hope they are there next time i stop by."}
{"text":"Solid burgers with inventive toppings. Outstanding onion rings and crisp duck fat fries..mmmm good! Waitress was friendly and efficient. I split the bacon burger and the thin lizzy with a friend. We both loved the thin lizzy burger.   I thought there beer list would be a bit better. I remember going there when they first opened and remembered seeing more Founders products. This time it seemed like a lot of english, kolsch's  and hefe's on and in winter time meh' those are too light but any way I got a Bells Jave stout and was happy!   Ya' know its a burger joint elevated by the Iron Chef Symon who seems like a really great chef and person so I like going and supporting local business even if I'm full for three days straight afterwards!!"}
{"text":"I really like Michael Symon and want to support his restaurants, but i have to say i've been very disappointed lately with Bspot.  I went during the holidays and got a chicken sandwich that was both almost burned as well as undercooked in part of chicken.  i chalked it up to the holidays, not the usual staff and frankly, it's probably not reasonable to expect a great chicken sandwich at a burger place.  I decided to keep on coming since we typically eat there once/twice a month. The hostess/greeting team at the front of the entrance have always been kind of , but i've kind of ignored it.  Tonight, we went again for dinner, at 5:45, when several tables were open.  First, the hostesses did not seat our party of two for 40 MINUTES while larger parties walked in and were seated immediately.  when i inquired why, i was told that only the tables outside in the \"mall area\" were for two people, and none of those were available.  WHAT CRAP.  when i complained and asked when we would be seated, and saw OTHER parties of two being seated, all of a sudden we were seated.  it really left a bad taste in my mouth.  The waitress was polite and the food was fine, but I think the treatment we got tonight was just crappy.  Very disappointed in the place now and i'll be going elsewhere unless i hear of a turnaround.  They've lost a good, regular customer."}
{"text":"Burgers are juicy, juicy, juicy.  Amazing bun.  Fries are okay, but they are really condiment delivery devices.   The variety and creativeness of the sauces available at your table is amazing.  Great beers and service!  Do your self a favor and have the milkshake.  You won't have another without thinking of this one!"}
{"text":"I was there approximately two years ago. As I recall, a card on the table suggested customers \"refrain from\" making substitutions. I don't like bleu cheese and asked for a different cheese (one that was available for a different burger with other things I didn't want.  I was admonished by the server. For some reason, we stayed. The server commented on the fact that I had finished my burger. I told her to take a picture. I haven't been back."}
{"text":"I know this isn't very detailed, but this burger joint is owned by famous local chef Michael Symon. Buy any burger and a bad-a** shake. 10/10 pairing! The items are $$, but just get this combo you will never regret it!  BTW, there is a mini B-Spot at Quicken Loans Arena in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Experience #3  Yo! and Brueben delicious.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Had the best brat ever.  Thought it was a great deal also.  No need to order a side of fries since theres a huge portion on top of the Clevelander along with creamy coleslaw and hot sauce.  All for the whopping price of $5.  Had the applie pie bacon shake and I thought there is no way I can finish all this.  FYI I'm a pretty big guy also...250lbs.  But don't look a pound over 240.  Anywoo, I even asked for a to go cup for the half shake that was left.  However, I got a second wind and was able to finish the shake while paying the check, waiting for change and pretending like I was paying attention to the college football game that on.  This was around 2:30/late lunch.  Had some fruits and veggies around dinner time and I was all set.  Slept like a baby too."}
{"text":"Great burger... also had fried bologna sandwich with egg..  picked table is good but didn't like kimchi... as Korean person... need real kimchi"}
{"text":"Finally made it to B spot. Friday night happy hour, the wait was 50 mins. The pagers have a long range so you can walk around in the nearby shops, that made it a little easier to take. Also I read that you can call ahead for a table time so i'll try that next time.   We ordered burgers and they did not disappoint. I ordered the Lola burger and can honestly say it was one of the best burgers i have ever had. During Happy hour the Lola fries are a buck and are absolutely delicious. Rounded the meal out with a draft beer from a very large diverse selection,  3 dollars during happy hour!  My daughters shared a chocolate shake and it was homemade quality.  My youngest had a chicken tender kids meal and it was tasty and very large. She took half of it home. It also came with a small cupcake which is a nice touch.   Regarding the burger size. I felt it was just about right. I finished my burger and Lola fries and thats about all I could have eaten.  My wife took part of her burger and some Lola fries home. If you need more burger than this you have a very large appetite. I'm sure the size far exceeds a standard portion size. Frankly any larger and it would be an unhealthy amount of calories.   The quality of the ingredients are very apparent when tasting the food. Everything tastes better than homemade. Fried foods are prepared in Lard so this is the real McCoy.  To me it tasted as if Michael Symon himself made this meal. Add to this a great server and an cool atmosphere that I would call industrial trendy. I would definitely recommend B Spot. If you can make it during happy hour that will be the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"This is the only burger place that wont let you add ANYTHING on your burger.  It def was NOT worth the price and the canned chilli on the fries looked like cat food and lacked real chilli flavor.  The service was horrible, we never got any refills or asked how the food was and our plates were only cleared because thats the only way we could sign the tab.  I guess for mall food its okay but anyone who scores this place a 5 obviously has never had a great burger.  If its something you can easily duplicate at home with no cooking skills then its def not worth $9 at a restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to go to a place we have never went to and she suggested B Spot.  I watch Iron Chef and know of Michael Simon.  We LOVED it!  The setting is very nice.  The food came out fast and the server was excellent.  The food was great!  We spent $30 bucks between the two of us and it was much better than anything we have ever had at an Olive Garden or an Applebee's. Some might say it is a bit pricey, but it is so worth it.  I can't wait to go back.  If there was one negative, the men's bathroom is very small.  For a place so packed I would not have expected to wait in line.  Though, it was very clean.  I would recommend the B Spot to anyone."}
{"text":"My first time toB~spot-  Love Michael Simon and was not disappointed with the burger.  It was a beautiful afternoon and we decided to sit outside  for lunch. What a good choice.  Service was wonderful. Food was DELICIOUS!!!!  We had burgers and you can build them as you like them. Other choices to choose from also. Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had.....definitely best burger in Ohio. Not crazy big, it was the perfect size. I think I would've still loved it had it been just the burger and bread. Great flavor!!"}
{"text":"Here's a surprise: an honest review. Ya Michael S is great for Cleveland but B Spot just got stingier. They used to have a decent $5 happy hour price on their over priced little burgers. But no more. They replaced that with 50 cent piece sized beef patty \"sliders\"; and oh ya, they dropped wings from their menu. The bartender stated \"we only want to sell you the best and we can't find organic wings, so we just won't sell them\". Gee, what does that say about the $10 wings i used to get there. This is typical of Simon's mantra: \"big plate, small portion, haha\". Maybe he didn't think we watch the chew when he dropped that gem on TV. I'm done with B Spot."}
{"text":"First time here and heard great things about the place. It definitely lived up to expectations. It was packed when i walked in, so I sat at the bar. Great decision. Although there was only one bartender, she was very attentive to her customers while pouring drinks for the wait staff. She was very friendly, knew both the food and beer menu inside out, and presented all options. Great experience, great food, great service."}
{"text":"One of the top 3 burgers I've eaten.  Rosemary fries were perfect and service was relaxed and friendly.  I had the porky, which had pulled pork and a slaw that had bacon incorporated.    Yum.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and i ate here before headinh into cleveland for a concert for our anniversary. Great food and service. I had the fat doug and the apple pie and bacon milkshake. The milkshake was the star of the meal. The burger was good but not great. It wasn't bad either though. Maybe I had lofty expectations. Overall great atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a burger person (but I'm not one of those girls that only eats salads either), but I gave this place a go when my boyfriend and I were looking for a fun place to grab dinner.  I was VERY surprised at how small this location is, especially for the popularity behind this restaurant.  With that being said, you can expect to wait for a table.  Don't make the mistake we did and get there after the surrounding stores close because there isn't much to do while you wait, buzzer light up thing in hand.  Once we sat down we ordered pretty quickly and didn't have to wait long for our food.  Burgers were pretty good (definitely check out the pickle bar and try ALL of the sauces they give you at the table), but I wasn't \"WOW'd\". I was, however, impressed with the extensive beer list - although I'm a fan of any restaurant/bar that has 21st Amendment Hell or High Watermelon beer.  If you're a fan of Michael Symon, then you'll like this place.  However, if you're looking for an exceptional burger then I'd suggest driving down the street to Five Guys where you'll get a better, bigger burger for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Meh.  Everything there was fine, but that's about it...  Shouldn't you want more than just \"okay\" from your hamburgers? When I want a burger, I want a burger. Big, juicy, meaty, with some vegetables and cheese on top; a smooshy bun that got a little toasted on the grill; the grease needs to seep onto the fresh cut fries a little bit so I get some of that flavor on them... and B Spot is NOT the place to get that.   I'm not from Cleveland, and haven't lived in Ohio for several years, so maybe I just don't get the Michael Symon (sp?) hype, but I thought this place was just okay. Maybe it's because I'm a burger traditionalist, and I don't want to have chutney or goat cheese on burgers. Maybe the burgers just weren't that good. Maybe I just want regular old Heinz ketchup for fries that don't have rosemary or something-infused oil on them. I'm not sure. If I was craving a burger, this wouldn't be the first place I thought of. If I were in Crocker Park and wanted something to eat, I might stop in. It's not regrettable, just not worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty good, as are the fries, but our server was genuinely uninterested in serving our table. Food took a really long time, and was lukewarm when served. Drinks sat empty until we asked for refills. Just really inattentive and kind of seemed annoyed that we were there."}
{"text":"If someone says this place is not worth all the hype they are obviously a Simon hater. The burgers are excellent every time I visited. This time I had the award winning Fat Doug delish and a chocolate banana marshmallow shake( which i didn't want to try b/c of the name) oh was i wrong it was the perfect blend of chocolate with banana topped with slightly charred marshmallows . To die for and it never turned it to chocolate milk which was great because it is quite large so it will take a while to finish. If you haven't tried this place you are missing out on some awesomeness"}
{"text":"Had the symon burger.  It was tasty...less impressed with the chili cheese fries - dry and left a lot to be desired.  The sauce selection makes it all better though, definitely the saving grace!  Service was subpar though..."}
{"text":"Finally, a burger place where the burgers are not insanely huge! Tasty, tasty burgers, lots of choices, and they were happy to do individual checks for our party of 8. Wish I lived in town."}
{"text":"Co-worker and I were looking for a place for lunch and noticed B Spot in the strip mall we were in. I had no idea it was a Michael Symon place because I'm not from the area. I was so excited to see a photo of MS when we entered the restaurant because I love Michael Symon. Got the Thin Lizzy and fries co worker made his own with jack cheese and grilled onions. Delicious and perfectly cooked! Fries were crispy which is a big deal for me---I hate mushy fries. Thought the sauces on each table and the pickle bar added a unique touch. Really good friendly service, too. Would definitely come back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i went here on a whim because buffalo wild wings was too packed, so happy we did! we both built our own burgers, mine was basically a bacon cheeseburger. He had a cheeseburger with pulled pork and a fried egg, the burgers were just about as big as our heads! hands down the best burger I've ever had, we got one order of the fries, and ended up fighting over them. absolutely amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"Environment: Perfect for a burger place.  Great interior design that is on par with a New York or Chicago burger joint.   Service: Sunday around noon.  Great service and quick service.  Orders were perfectly entered.  I believe she had a hand electronic device for orders. Food:  Shared half a Porky and New Jack City, Lola fries and onion rings.  Aesthetically not that exciting.  But the Porky Burger was a meat eaters delight.  The richness of the complimenting meats made a fantastic symphony of flavors.  I like my foods simple and robust.  As expected, cooked to perfection.  That is key to a great burger, especially when you want it medium rare. The New Jack City burger was a solid 6 in comparison.  The Lola fries with lola catchup were as expected.  I'm guessing that they don't fry them in lard like at the flagship Lola, but still good.  I could be wrong though. The onion rings were solid, but not special.  The portions for all were perfect.  I felt satisfied without feeling gluttonous as I walked to my car."}
{"text":"Yet another example of Michael Symon not living up to his hype.    In theory, B-Spot is supposed to be your typical burger joint-- no reservations, waiters with t-shirts, booths, milkshakes, and a relatively loud atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is awkwardly situated halfway in a swanky shopping mall, and is far too overpriced to be your typical 'burger joint'.  This could, of course, be forgiven, if the burgers were something special.  And you probably would expect them to be, given the 'Symon' name, as well as the numerous online articles discussing the 'special blend' of meats that only comes from Pat LaFrieda's meat wholesale in New York.  Wow!  Special meat flown in from New York!  It must be worth the extra money!  Alas, this sort of logic will only lead to disappointment.  The burgers are not incredible.  They are not inspired.  They aren't even great.  They easily compare to the similarly priced burgers you find in any moderately competent restaurant-- burgers, I might add, that include side dishes.  (I mean seriously, what is a burger without fries?  And why should I have to pay $5 more for them at B-Spot?  This is America dammit! )       Curse you Michael Symon.  I've fallen prey to your shiny head and savvy marketing techniques for a second time, and the shame for this folly now rests squarely on my shoulders."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger & onion rings and shake!  We were out shopping in Crocker park one day and are fairly new to the area. We dropped into the B&N and asked the cashier where to find a burger, she pointed us to the B spot...  It took about 15 minutes to seat us because they were so busy, but they move quickly. It's a casual place so there's picnic tables, paper towels on the table and concrete floors.  The menu is straight forward and the beer is a plenty :-)  My husband and I settled on each of us having a Lola burger each medium-rare, fries, onion rings and cider beer....   The burgers were juicy and flavorful, I loved the marinated onions. The battered onion rings were tasty. My husband's only complaint was he didn't care for the shoe string fries...would rather have thicker hand cut...but that's just a preference, nice flavor though...  Even though we had gorged ourselves, my husband insisted on trying a shake. We were not disappointed.   We shared the vanilla apple pie bacon shake...as he likes to say \"everything goes with bacon\"... We will be returning and working our way through the menu :-)"}
{"text":"This place was nice and clean. It is in a shopping center so it is a bit small and the tables seemed cramped. I sat at the bar for lunch. Wasn't too busy and I didn't have to wait. The food came out fairly quickly. I ordered the chick magnet. It's a chicken sandwich. It was pretty good. Not over the top, but good. I asked if they had red onion because the menu didn't say it came with. The server said it did come with red onion. I asked if they could add anything else such as cheese. She stated they wouldn't let her add anything. It comes out the way it is. I can take away but not add. ???? Didn't get the red onion either. I was offered fries and said yes. They came out with rosemary pastured all over them. Way too much for my liking. They were extra, $4 almost half what the sandwich was. I drank water and the total bill was $15. Also a little too much for in my opinion.   All in all, it was decent. Would get a 4 if it hadn't been for the price and the lack of options in the adds."}
{"text":"Iron Chef Michael Symon's burger joint is consistently great.  Try the Lola burger. Don't  forget to have some Tony Packo's pickles."}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I don't come to the B-Spot for the burgers ( even though they are really good.) I come for the Stadium Brats, the pickle bar, and the Lola fries.  The Stadium Brats are brats smothered in mustard and grilled onions, and they are absolutely fantastic. The pickle bar is great, especially the Tony Packo's sweet and spicy ones ( seriously... try them.) The Lola fries are awesome, they are thinly sliced fries, sprinkled with rosemary and sea salt. If you don't have them when you go you have completely missed out on the B-Spot experience. This place is really good for kids, however the fact that they don't take reservations or let parts of the group come in at different times I can see would be really frustrating. I only come with my family of 5 so it's never a problem for us. It has delicious food, and to me that's all that matters in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a group of 5. Was loud but not too bad, though we did have to raise our voices a little to talk sometimes.  Menu choices were good. I had the Red Hot which was tasty, but not that spicy/hot.  Pickle bar is a great addition and compliments the food well. Onion rings were big portions and had a nice crunch to them. Choice of special condiments on the table was a great touch. Coffee BBQ was my favorite.  Overall a great niche eatery but didn't blow my socks off."}
{"text":"B Spot is a great place to hit if you're up for a quick casual dinner in a cool atmosphere. When you walk in the door you're immediately greeted by a giant beer can wall outlining an enormous \"B\"!   I had to laugh when I saw it because I was transported back in time to my brother's college apartment where he and his buddies had wallpapered their dining room in flattened cardboard beer boxes from all the beers they had consumed in three years on campus at YSU. Yes all four walls, floor to ceiling, 12' high ceilings at that.  Back to B Spot's decor, above the bar you will notice that there are motorcycle parts welded to a frame that hangs from the ceiling. I'm looking at it a while and can't seem to put my finger in why it feels familiar to me. Then it clicks! Models! Car models, motorcycle models! Just like bro and I used to glue together when we were kids on long winter days when we were stuck inside in Cleveland! So cool to me at how it just brought me back to those times, snapping the model parts out of the plastic frame that they came attached to inside the model box. I couldn't help smiling and pointing it out to hubs. He has his own model building memories that go a little further, involving fireworks and blowing up the finished models   Onto the food and service, the burgers were good and the service was excellent! I had the Fat Doug which was pretty tasty. The combination of the Swiss Cheese with Pastrami and mustard was very tasty but the slaw was a bit sour for my taste. The fries were to die for! Seasoned perfectly with finely chopped rosemary and salt. It was a brilliant flavor component that made the meal. If you are into pickles then make sure you step over to the pickle bar. There's a big variety of pickles and peppers to perch onto your perfect burger!   By all means stop on in to the B Spot for a night out in a cool atmosphere. Don't forget to look around at the other pieces of art mounted on the wall. There's some pretty cool paintings hanging around"}
{"text":"I have been to B Spot three times and each time I have been disappointed. When all you do is burgers you need to be able to cook them to the desired temp - on every visit my burger and my friends burger were not cooked to medium and medium rare. Each time They have been under cooked -- this last time one was raw in the center. The staff is nice and take them back to cook again but sadly I had to send them back a second time.   Don't get the iced tea - it is the nastiest tasting tea I have ever had ... It is tea not that hard to make but they need to remove it from the  menu since they cannot get it right.   Do try the tomato blue cheese soup - yummy.   Two stars because of the soup and the staff - no stars for the burgers."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my customer.  We almost got the bacon milkshake, because they recommended it,  but in the interest of getting work done in the afternoon, we opted for regular drinks instead.  All of us like the burgers, and the pickle bar is a plus.  My customer got the Atomic burger, and said it actually had decent flavor in addition to heat.   The sides were all pretty good too."}
{"text":"Thought I might check this place out with all of the favorable reviews. The place was pretty empty, three waitress's stood huddled, the bar was in attended. After waiting ten minutes at the bar a bar tender finally appeared. She took my order, and then disappeared. I in turn disappeared"}
{"text":"First time the day after Thanksgiving.   Had the Lola.   I love breakfast so adding bacon and a fried egg to a burger I am all in.  Great burger.  Service was good.  The only thing that bothered me was fries are ala carte.  We ordered some for the table.  They were ok, nothing extraordinary.   The was great though."}
{"text":"If this was not a Symon joint then all the reviews would be worse.  You are paying for the \"Iron Chief\" not the food.  The guy is turning into a one trick pony.  He hasn't changed the Lola menu in 3 years.  I will start off by saying I had a horrible experience at the B-Spot.  The waitress treated us like we were stupid.  After ordering my burger well done it came out red in the middle.  I asked them to cook it a bit longer.  When the burger came back out it was just as red.  After this I had them send it back again to go back on the grill.  This time the cook came out and watched me cut into it making sure it was done.  He was rude and it was a total slap in the face.  By this time the rest of my table was finished.  When the bill came they still charged me for the burger!!  I couldn't belive it.  Honestly, the burgers arent even that good.  Symon, we get it, you can put an egg on a burger.  Burger, Beer, Fries, and a 50 dollar bill for 2 people.  Not a quick and cheap burger joint like they try to make it into.  B-Spot=Fail."}
{"text":"Good location. The burger's are all great, they also have a good on tap beer selection. The cooks are good at this place. I've never had a burger come out not cooked how I ordered it. Not a huge fan of skinny fries, but they're OK fries. I've been to this location a good number of times and when I'm in the mood for 'burgers and beers' kinda place, more often than not I go here."}
{"text":"I am a burger lover and like most people, I enjoy my burger with fries. This place has very good (7.5/10) burgers. However, your only choice for fries is LARD-FRYED. You heard me! Fries that are fryed in LARD.  Perhaps the cook has not heard, but there is an awakening that is taking place in America. For quite a few years now, a renaissance has been happening where people are finding that healthier food is better for them. That life is happier when one is healthy. That fatty food is not necessarily good food. That eating oodles of butter is not good for you. In fact, it's down right disgusting. Perhaps, the proliferation of \"organic food\" in supermakets and food markets is not a clear enough sign. In this day and age, in the middle of this renaissance, of healthier Americans and healthier America, LARD is a dirty word; LARD is synonymous with NASTY. Wake up B-Spot cook! Or don't! The Rail just opened up across the street. Not only is their burger superior (8.5/10), but their fries are awesome. In fact, they have not one, but three choices of fries. Can't wait to try them all. Bon appetite America."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent.  I've had better burgers.  Nothing really stood out, except for the tried and true tasty Lola fries.    Honestly what really put me off was the service.  We went on a Saturday night and had about a 30 minute wait (which is to be expected and totally fine by myself and my boyfriend, we always just wait at the bar)  For starters, the bartender was rude, rude, RUDE.  Seemed very annoyed to be working, very annoyed that she had to give us menus, very annoyed that I asked a question about their wine.  But it wasn't just us, I noticed her rolling her eyes to other customers sitting at the bar as well.  That sorta sets the tone for the evening when you spend 30 minutes under that kind of attitude.    So then we get seated.  An ever-so-slightly thawed out version of the bartender was our waitress.  She was irritated that we weren't ready to order the first time she came over, she stared off to space & looked around the room as my boyfriend was asking a question about a particular dish, and never took our drink order.  It was just bad vibes all around from the staff.  I get it, it's Saturday night, it's busy.  But geez, we didn't do anything outlandish or demanding to warrant such foulness.  The nicest person we came across there was the sweet little hostess who was smiles all around when we walked in and even as we left.  She was super nice.  That was about it.  I'll stick with Lola."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying B Spot for sometime.  We live in LA and visit OH during the holidays so I finally had my chance. First, I understand the holiday week is busy.  But a veteran chef / restaurant owner, should hire a management staff who can schedule appropriately.  I had no problem waiting for table.  Once seated the server was slow and unattentive.  We ordered way too much food.  I usually appreciate a waitress who offers advice on how many sides to order or if we have ordered too much food.   Food:  burger was not cooked to our request.  My well done was rare. It took so long to receive our order, I didn't bother to send back, plus our waitress never came back to check on our food.  Why ask?  Onion rings were only warm bordering on cold.  Finally, no offer of drink refills and no water?  Burger tasted like any burger I could make but wouldn't. My own turkey burger is far superior. Just overall pretty poor experience; food and service. I'm gonna stick with Unami Burger in LA."}
{"text":"Love those Lola fries (rosemary!) and the tasty burgers (I recommend the Shroomage). Salads are big enough for 4-5 people to split. The only drawback is the shortage of seating. We waited an hour (no reservations accepted) and still ended up only getting a table in the spillover section (a courtyard right beyond the entrance essentially in the foyer of the mall in which this place is housed). Best advice I can come up with: go on a weeknight. I haven't had a chance to try that, but for sure our visit on a Saturday evening wasn't ideal, given how popular this venue is!"}
{"text":"I used to love a good burger at Bspot. However, it has now started to feel like a basic chain restaurant.   Two of the five burgers at our table had to be sent back to the kitchen because they were way over cooked. Not to mention the kids mini burgers which were well well done--essentially charred black. .  When they were brought back, all of the fries and sides were gone and the manager made us cut open the burgers to check if it looked ok. Don't they know how to cook medium rare?!   Once I started eating it again I thought something tasted weird. They gave me a different type of burger. After scraping off the pulled pork I didn't order, I ate a mediocre burger.   I didn't want to wait again! Especially since our 30 minute wait for the table was actually over an hour! Our server never checked on us until I managed to get enough to eat.   Even after we told her about the wrong burger, there was no adjustment to the bill and no apology. Bad customer service, weak food, new plastic coated menu...., what happened to the chic burger joint?   So sad. Now it feels like a regular boring chain. :-("}
{"text":"Was there on Tuesday July 28th. Michael Symon has out done himself at the restaurant. Everything was above and beyond except one thing-and we will discuss that later.  Decor is unique. Love the garage door. Food was great.  I had the YO Burger. Had the shasha sauce on the side because I want sure what to expect. Ate all the sauce-was good.  Onions rings were nothing spectacular- just good. Server was good-explained the specials and knew what came on the burgers. Refilled the drinks when needed. Now the bad news.  The hostess( and I am using the word loosely) was awful. She was headed back to the hostess stand before we even got to the table. One menu was thrown on the table hard enough it landed on the bench of the booth. No one else was coming in behind us so I don't know why she was in such a hurry? As we're were leaving two of them were standing at the hostess stand and didn't give us a second or even first thought as we were leaving.  I could have told them to kiss my behind and they wouldn't have heard us. Michael --- if you want a hostess to seat people .... Get a hostess.  I am not the first to complain about them. Hope it changes before I come back."}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing food made it the complete lunch experience...their Christmas Alex on tap is great and their burgers are completely out of this world...had the Lola Burger with sunny side up egg ,pickled onions, and bacon..meat was tender not bun was soft ...went down very smooth and the taste was savory..yummmmmy in my tummmmy"}
{"text":"This place does not live up to the hype. My chocolate milkshake was so thick that I literally couldn't even drink it, and it it refused to melt down to a drinkable thickness throughout the entire meal. I don't know what they use to make their milkshakes, but it's probably not traditional ice cream, because ice cream is nowhere near that thick. The burger that I had was ok, but definatly nothing special. The Lola fries were disgusting!!! There was so much rosemary on them that I couldn't eat them without sneezing, and the flavor was so overpowering that I couldn't taste the actual fries themselves underneath all of all of that seasoning. Overall, it was definatly not a good experience, and their prices are so high that it's not really worth giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Maybe not the best burger out there, but definitely one of the best I've ever had in my (so far, relatively short) lifetime. I ordered the Shroomage (portabella mushroom, blue cheese, Lola steak sauce, and griddled onions) and even through I will almost never voluntarily eat blue cheese, I took the plunge and had it this time around. It definitely went nicely with all of the other flavors and I can't imagine having this burger any other way. My burger was a perfectly-cooked medium and arrived at the table as a hot, juicy, delicious main-course.  The Lola fries were fantastic, the garlic wings and sriracha wings tasty and flavorful, and the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake (yes, with bourbon) was amazing. The beer list was pretty nice, too!  During my visit (around 6:30pm on a Saturday) there was only a 20min wait (which was spent drinking beer at the bar) and once seated found service to be fast, courteous, and the staff to be helpful. I was un-bothered by their policies, but I'm, admittedly, generally a low-key person.  I'll definitely go back on one of my future trips to Cleveland."}
{"text":"From the burgers, to the beer, to the all around atmosphere, 5 stars across the board. This burger joint is outstanding and unorthodox items like a pickle bar and various brats makes it truly unique. There is only one word to describe my time at BSpot... \"Satisfied\""}
{"text":"First time eating there and I have to say the atmosphere and food was pretty great. There was a pickle bar but I didn't go up there, but when I'm back in town I definitely need to check it out. Nice area to just hangout and enjoy good food with good people."}
{"text":"Decent place, found it on yelp under \"vegetarian\". They do offer a sub par veggie burger, however the staff failed to mention that everything is fried in lard, making it pointless to offer burgers. What's a burger without fries? Un American if you ask me. Im glad that I noticed it on the menu between my order and my wifes order or things could have gotten messy."}
{"text":"Great burgers, killer onion rings and the best espresso milkshakes ever. The service was great and appreciated the manager stopping by to check in with us. The burgers were perfectly cooked. A great place all around."}
{"text":"Very average, overcooked hamburger. I have to say the milkshake (seasonal) was excellent though"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch around 11:30 on a weekday. Always wanted to try B spot out and finally was in the area. We walk in and didn't know if we should wait for someone to seat us or just sit. So we stood there while about 6 workers just stood around the bar and chit chatted. We sat ourselves after an awkward 2 minutes of just standing there.   Food....hey I love a good burger. Ordered just a cheeseburger with lola fries. I ordered my burger medium well. Lola fries were fantastic! Burger could of walked out it was so pink inside, not even rare. I mentioned this to waitress and she said sorry, I will take it back and bring you a new one. I got the new burger and it was like a hockey puck it was so well done. Mentioned it to the waitress again and she apologized and asked if I wanted a third! I said no thanks.   Got the bill and they still charged me for the burger! I had two bites of meat??? We walked out unhappy and no one greeted us goodbye.   Maybe ill try again...but I am no rush to go back. ."}
{"text":"Went to the B Spot last night after a 20 day backpacking trip through the grand tetons. Tried to different burgers the \"yo\" and \"porky\" had the fries and the seasonal shake. Strawberry shortcake. All finish btw.... lets start with the burgers yo was good but just a tad over done. Porky had great flavors and was the clear winner in my mind. Fries were good. The biggest disappointment was the milk shake. It basically just tasted like a  vanilla shake not much strawberries or  shortcake at all. Still a grand meal for the price.  I Highly recommend! Bon appetite"}
{"text":"Sorry,  not impressed. Very fatty burgers.  French fries suck! The service was great."}
{"text":"The server was great but the reason I give this place 2 stars is because their serving sizes are tiny and the restaurant is chintzy! There were 5 of us at the Westlake location. Two of us ordered a glass of wine and there was such a small amount in these tumbler glasses it was funny. One person ordered avocados for her sandwich and she was given a small slice! The ketchup was almost out on the table...I don't know....they just seemed like tight wads for the price they charge! They give you some pickles but you have to go up to a self serve place to retrieve them!"}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever EVER had!  Not only does the food ROCK, but the atmosphere & vibe of this place is teaming with awesome!  I'm all the way from St. Louis Mo & had to try it!  Just sad that you don't have one in STL..."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed by this place and will be back.  Came here for lunch with my sister while shopping.  I was just expecting a typical burger place, but it was much better.    Part of the awesomeness was that we got there 5 minutes before \"happy hour\" started.  This meant that burgers were 5 dollars, fries 1 dollar, and most beers were 3 dollars.  Talk about a bargain.  I had one of each, so my bill was a grand total of 10 something.    My burger was properly cooked.  I like medium well, which means I want a little pink.  99% of the time when I order a burger medium well, it is well done and dry when it comes to the table.  I was overjoyed at the mere fact that my burger wasn't dried out.  The fries were good and there were a lot of them.  Probably could have split an order with my sister, though that seemed ridiculous to save one dollar.  Go during happy hour, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This was on the go-to list when my husband and I visited Cleveland, and we weren't disappointed! Our burgers were fantastic, and the milkshake we shared was worth the extra calories."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with the food & drinks. It was horrible. The service was decent, but the the food was just disgusting."}
{"text":"Great burger, above average salad, and fresh pork rinds SOLD!  Add Pickle bar and we are in business.  A little pricey but I would go back."}
{"text":"Decent burgers though not as juicy/tasty as either Flipside or the 5 guys chain. Fries are excellent but beer selection is somewhat limited.   Lot parking is available though the popularity of the mall (Eton) limits this at meal times."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with friends. The food was good, I liked the pickle barn and the service was great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Definitely great and different food.  The burgers are not huge but perfectly filling.  Beer is over-priced.  Also loved the atmosphere and overall decor.  There are no reservations - so get there early, put your name in and then do some shopping at the many shops in the shopping center."}
{"text":"I agree with the review by W B. The burgers were ok but too expensive for having to buy fries separately for $4. Mom got a salad and it costed $4.99 to add one grilled patty on top. Shakes were $6.99 almost the price of a burger. The atmosphere was nice but felt more like a Chipotle type seating place/size without Chipotle like prices."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going here and I wasn't disappointed.  The place was a perfect size.  My friend and I had fun looking at the beer cans along the wall and recalling our own beer can collections from our youth.  I ordered a turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, girdled onions and roasted peppers. The burger was delicious. The texture of the turkey burger was so different from anything else I have tried.  The Lola fries had a great taste and it was great dipping them in the different sauces."}
{"text":"Mark our server was absolutely  5 star. Our dining experience was exceptional because of him.    Oh btw food was good ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap, greasy burger this isn't the place that you want to go to. However, if you're looking to have quality ingredients and a burger that will please the palette this is the place to go.   I had the \"fun guy\" and enjoyed the creamy blue cheese and grilled mushroom and onion. I added a few of the pickled onions from the pickle bar to give a a bit of crunch and a hint of acid to cut through and it was delicious. The Lola fries are crisp, hot and wonderfully seasoned and the Lola ketchup pairs well with it. Sure it may be pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The burger was great, and the service was excellent. It was very busy, but we did not have to wait long for a table or for our order. The \"porky\" burger was cooked to perfection. I felt my arteries clogging up a little more with every bite, but it's worth it.   A little on the pricey side.... As there is no side that comes with it. This isn't your McDonald's type burger joint so you'll have to pony up a little more for some fries and a shake. Very much worth it, don't be cheap.   Beer selection is very good as well, perfect if your looking to try something new and different. But they also have staples like bud light.   It's a bit crammed, but that's usually a sign that your at the right place for good food."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that B Spot is my first experience with Michael Symon's food.  But, MY GOD, this was a good first impression.  The Thin Lizzie was the best burger i have ever had.  If you have seen the \"Best Burger in New York\" episode of How I Met Your Mother (if you haven't seen the show consider this a freebie recommendation) my experience was pretty much like that.  \"It tasted like Christmas... Meat Christmas.\"  I dare you to try the Rosemary French Fries and not say they are the best fries ever.  Then dip them in the Coffee BBQ sauce.. Game... Set...Match.  All joking aside service and atmosphere were great.  They were out of Great Lakes Christmas Ale, but the waitress suggested Dogfish Head Christmas Ale which ended being even better.  I have now bought Symon's new cookbook and look forward to visiting all his other restaurant locations."}
{"text":"I liked going here for their Happy Hour. They changed happy hour to just slders and alcohol,  wont be back. Menu in general is reducedno more wings, brats, and many of the specialty burgers are gone. Oh well onto somewhere else, for a better happy hour."}
{"text":"I  strongly dislike waiting any longer than 4 minutes to be greeted by whoever our server may be. Even more so when the number of visible working employees greatly outnumbers the patrons at 345 PM on a very slow Thursday.   We came expecting the happy hour of half-off burgers, $1 fries, and good deals on drinks from long ago....but was sorely disappointed to discover that it no longer is offered. While the $1 fries are still offered, paying $10 for 6 sliders seemed a bit ridiculous...among other things.   The more time that slowly crept by after being seated, as well as my disappointing discovery of a newer/shittier happy hour, and the looming dread of paying ALOT more than I was anticipating with a party of 3, we were just about to walk out.   Oh wait, there's our server, fine, I guess we will stay and hope it's at least worth it. Server seemed nice I guess, table ordered 2 build your owns, 3 fries, a porky burger and PBR for me - of which I received BOTH the can and an empty glass. I'm fine with just a can, server could have asked a preference at least.   The wait time was fine in terms of receiving our order. But not short enough to distract me from noticing a number of fruit flies buzzing around our table and in our faces. One of them actually found its way down into my dumb glass of PBR, needless to say I was done drinking after finding it. What the fuck?!  Burgers were cooked decently. Mine came without the BBQ sauce it was supposed to come with - so the tableside coffee BBQ had to do. Fries were great, but all of our burgers just made the bottom bun a soggy, unappealing mess.   Should have just walked out and gone somewhere else. $50 really didn't sit well with me with this experience. Would only consider coming back for a better, price-appealing happy hour that includes actual burgers instead of shitty sliders. But I doubt that will be happening."}
{"text":"Best gourmet burger ever!"}
{"text":"Delicious veg patty but what's galling is that they won't substitute any of the burgers with the veg patty. Though they allow you to design your own burger, they don't mind substituting the beef with Turkey for their signature burgers but they won't do that for a veg patty. It speaks of arrogance and inflexibility and weird anti-vegetarianism. Their French fries are cooked in lard too(not specified in the menu). Clearly vegetarianst aren't welcome here. I know I'm not going back again.(unless they change their policy)"}
{"text":"Great sauce and pickles, i would definitely go here when I need a good burger,last time I was there it did not hit the B spot for me, doesn't mean it's bad, I just wasn't in the mood for a burger maybe . Beautiful interior design."}
{"text":"I've been to B Spot twice now, both for a weekday lunch. The atmosphere is like a nice chain spot. there is really nothing unique about it, atmosphere or food wise. oh wow they have a wall of cans, so does tremont tap house. oh man they have a red hot burger with pulled pork on it! oh wait so does fat heads brewery (its called the cuyahoga).   things that make this place good:   its in a location where there isn't really anything noteworthy in their price point, and i appreciate that it is close to my work.   the beer selection is decent, but prices are all over the board though. stick with the drafts, the bottles are way over priced.   things that would make me not want to drive across town for it:  the food. it is well priced, but depending on where you are at in the city, you have options for a burger just as good if not better (bar cento's burger or buckeye beer engine come to mind)  ive heard horrible things about the wait but for lunch all you have to do is either get there at 11am or 1pm mon-thurs and you'll get seated right away.  don't go when everyone else does and you don't have to wait! it's that simple!   over all, it's a good option if you are around the area, and the prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try the B spot after being curious about their menu. The food came out super fast. Cooked to a visual perfect. Onion rings were great. Carnival like flavor to the onion batter. The taste of the burgers was fresh. One could tell they took pride in the origins of their beef. The table sauces were extensive. In fact 6 in all, from balsamic burger sauce, to a greek ShaSha sauce, to a coffee bbq, to good old American Katsup. They also had a pickle bar that was quite laughable despite some unique selections. The meal ate well but digested harsh. The two of us had flu-like symptoms post-meal and I woke in the middle of the night with a raging set of stomach pains and morning diarrea. Considering that was the last thing I ate for the day i'm sure it was the culperate. All in all I would have rather eat'in at FIVE GUYS. They have a cheaper and more supperior burger that you can get what ever you want on. Although we didn't try B-spots fries FIVE GUYS fries look superior. Only benifit to B-spot = You can order a beer with ur burger. Mike Symon and Doug Pekivich should have thought a lil harder before investing in a resturaunt that will only last maybe five years at the most. It will ultimately face the fate of bar-symon in Avon. Thumbs down boys! Grab ur sweetie, go to FIVE GUYS in the promenade right behind Symons joint, order togo, stop at Minnoti's accross the street, grab a six pack or a bottle of wine and go enjoy your meal at any of Westlake's many parks or beaches. You'll have a thousand percent better meal than at the B-spot. P.S. : The rule card gimmick is riddiculous! Save the ego trip dbags!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype! I've heard a lot about B-Spot and had high expectations coming in...I walked out happy and looking forward to our next visit.  Went with the Lola burger and was blown away...as good as burgers get!"}
{"text":"Oh my, Michael, PLEASE READ THIS!!!  I usually LOVE your restaurants. I think you need to get off your jet and park it in your Eton location for some basic training.  My first burger came out woefully overcooked (I ordered medium rare, it was medium well), when I sent it back after a long, long wait for the waitress to check in, I was served a raw F.U. burger.  Your manager was dismissive and somewhat rude when I showed him the raw meat on my plate... \"Oh, did you want a WARM red center?\"...\"Uh, no, I wanted a perfectly cooked medium rare burger like one of my dining companions had\".  Fries were cold and so-so...  Please.  If all you are going to serve are burgers, then please make them worth the visit."}
{"text":"Dissapointing.  1) If you want to create a no frills burger place, offer no frills prices. My burger is already overpriced, I should not have to pay $3 more for a simple change to make my own burger. The environment is not that cool unless you have never eaten outside of chain restaraunts. Despite the open patio, it was dark and cold inside at 5pm.  2) Everything was just... acceptable. Nothing I orderered or sampled from my companion's plates was extraodinary or even that surprising. Rosemary fries, would be great if the fries themselves actually tasted like anything at all.  3) Extremely rude service at the Crocker Park location. One word answers, no refills, and huffing about a side of mayo on a custom burger that the server forgot to bring to the table. Also? No water....  and no trips back to the table after the stray mayo was retrieved. We had to flag down another server to get our check.  I really don't get the hype about this place."}
{"text":"To once be a king is delightful but to be a queen? Burgers don't come with fries, nor any side of that matter. Kings demand a side to wash down such amounts of beef but this establishment foes not confide in those demands."}
{"text":"One of the most disgusting experiences ever.  Long strand of hair buried deep in my burger..."}
{"text":"Disgusting... Had a hair in my burger.  Would not expect such lax preparation coming from the iron chef... will not be back"}
{"text":"I love B Spot! I organized a birthday party for a friend - a party of 11 - and the hostesses were nothing but accommodating. We realized the wait would be long, so my hubby and I got there early, put in our name, went to Barnes & Noble next door, and told our friends to come an hour or so later. The wait is really no big deal if you have the extra time because there are so many great places to loiter and shop nearby. I went again last night with my hubby - again, the wait was no big deal - we went shopping, and once we got back, we discovered they had already called our name - they just gave us the next table available even though we missed our call.   The food... wow! I've gotten the Thin Lizzy and the Chili Willy and I loved them both. Some other reviewers found their burgers to be dry - I got both of my burgers medium, and they were both medium- nice and juicy! The chips are to die for - they come with the most delicious rosemary parmesan fondue. The banana chocolate marshmallow milkshake with rum... well... it's even better than it sounds!  It is a bit small, and the one-bathroom deal is pretty bad. Seriously gentlemen, it's a shared bathroom - put the seat down! But I really enjoy the decor and I don't find it too loud. Our waitstaff has been really friendly as well. Go to B Spot - expect a burger joint, crossed with Iron Chef talent, and get just that. Go to B Spot, expect Lola or a Fuddruckers.. and that you will not get."}
{"text":"Burgers were great and we loved the pickle bar. French fries had good flavor (love the Rosemary as seasoning) but we hate the shoestring fries, would prefer something thicker. They were also a bit over priced at $4 for a small portion. We also got a chocolate, banana, marshmallow milkshake and that was great too. We will return."}
{"text":"Love this Michael Symon restaurant!  The food is consistently good. The burgers are cooked as ordered and the topping combinations are delicious!  Be sure to get an order of the onion rings as well as the Lola fries. The beer selection is good and the staff are friendly and competent!  The only downside is trying to find a parking spot. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I honestly did not get this place. For the price the burger is tiny. Small side salad with iceberg lettuce $4. Didnot find the burger to be anything special especially since it was drowning in the supposed Lola steak sauce. The atmosphere.....weird. It's inside a mall so makes it look like a cheap bar. Would not go again"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to B Spot.  I was so excited to find out what all the hype is about.  When I walked in it wasn't busy (late afternoon on a Friday).  We were seated right away.  They have Pepsi products, iced tea, lemonade and a full bar.  My fiancee and I ordered iced tea which was served without sweetener.  We had to ask for the server to bring sugar.   When it came time to order we told the server we'd never been there before.  She barely greeted us and wasn't very welcoming for first time visitors.  I asked about the daily special.  It was a gyro burger (burger with gyro meat and tzatziki sauce), so I ordered that.  My fiancee ordered the Fat Doug (coleslaw, pastrami and mustard).  We ordered fries and onion rings to share.   We both ordered the burgers medium and they were perfectly cooked.  The gyro burger tasted like, well, a gyro.  Since we always share so we can try a bit of everything, I can say the Fat Doug burger was really good.  The fries are seasoned with rosemary and were very good.  The onion rings were really greasy, so much so that I felt the grease coat my mouth.  Our server never came back to refill drinks, she never smiled until she brought the bill.    I highly doubt I will go back here.  The food, service, atmosphere, nothing makes me want to get back here again.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  I guess I'll stick with 5 Guys for a burger craving."}
{"text":"Visited today and ordered an Atomic and Chesseburger with Fries. The quality of the Burger was good and cooked properly,  I was surprised that the hamburger buns were not fresh and crumbled apart.  I would think this would Hanburger 101 for any Burger joint.  I had many Burgers at Winking Lizard with Frest baked buns."}
{"text":"Burgers and atmosphere here look good but taste so so I would say worth to try I think since I'm too picky so u might like actually I will give it a shot one more time"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the rage is about this place. The burger I had was meh at best. The chili on it was cold, as if it had been sitting for a while before being put on my burger. Fries were mediocre. The best part of the place was the apple pie bacon shake and the multitude of dipping sauces at the tables."}
{"text":"Make sure to ask for fries or rings I got a togo order and was asking what the signature burger was obviously a typical 1st timer and they never told me the burger does not come with a side."}
{"text":"Great place to have a casual meal on the go! Food is very good, fast, waitress was friendly and curious. Fully enjoyable."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fat Doug. The sandwich was ok.  It was no better than what I could have done myself given the same ingredients.  The Rosemary fries were good and different.  Overall I spent just under $20 ( including tip) for a sandwich, fries and soda.  To me that was expensive for what I got.  I would think twice before going back for something that was just ok."}
{"text":"Burgers were cooked perfectly! The wait staff was exceptional dealing withour large group and did not hesitate about processing separate checks.  Our group, loved trying various brews offered.  The kids loved their milkshakes too!"}
{"text":"Went in on a slow day and was seated immediately.  The food was superb! The burger and Lola fries were fantastic. Definitely money well spent. The service on the other hand was unbearable, so I'm only able to award the food one star because the experience itself was awful. I'm not a high maintenance or needy diner, but even I have a limit.  Our waitress was like Grumpy Cat incarnate. She had a scowl plastered on her face our entire visit and acted as though she were annoyed to even have to deal with us. She was inexcusably inattentive given it was a slower day. We did have a gentleman (Chef? Manager?) ask how the food was, which was nice and hence where the additional star comes from.  She brought us our drinks, brought us our food, and then we had to flag her down to pay. Didn't check in to see how we liked the food or if we needed a refill like any other standard waitress in any other establishment would have done... She seriously just walked past our table and bumped the check with her hip when I asked her to ring it up. I shouldn't have to flag you down from talking to your friends in the back for you to take my money.?? That makes no sense. Based on that experience, she's much better suited to wash dishes or cut potatoes in the back, because front facing customer service is obviously not her forte.   I'd give it easily a 4.5 stars, but the inattentive, aloof, rude waitress kind of ruined it for me. If there's a way I can order ahead of time for a to-go, I'll definitely be back.  But if not, I'll just continue to patronize another burger joint in the Crocker Park area."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here with family. As we enjoyed some tasty brews and cider we tested out all the sauces with our order of fries we started with. Tasty!! For dinner we all ordered 4 different burgers and cut them into fours to taste each one. As we cheered to each one round of burger sample I couldn't help but enjoy the unique flavors of each burger we ordered. We finished off the meal with a spiked vanilla bean milk shake! Yummmm... My only complaint is the prices for this burger joint, therefore no 5 star but definitely deserving of a 4! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has done a tremendous job of consistently going down hill. Last night it was poor from the start. They did not let us know the table was ready. Once it was the service was slow the burgers were undercooked and ice cold. They should have never gotten rid of the chili or the wings. On the bright side the shakes were good. FlipSide is the better burger choice."}
{"text":"The last 2 times here they over cooked my burger. Ordered med. got a well done burger. Both times I complained & they happily replaced my burger.1st time the new burger was still well done but a little juicier than the 1st one. I didn't want to have more food wasted so I ate it. The 2nd time the replacement burger was cooked med. it was Delicious ! ! I forgot how wonderful they tasted!!!! Wrong burger though . what's with the over fried onion rings ? They did not charge me for the burgers. Michael teach your people how to cook your food. It's great when done right but if I have to return my next burger for one cooked correctly I'm done. I\"ve been back twice & order my burgers med/rare now. They come out cooked medium that way. No problem with over cooked burgers. Got onion rings once more, they were fried correctly."}
{"text":"UPDATED: Earlier in the year we had a big problem at this perennial favorite.  A friend referred my issue to their quality guy, who called me and he was solicitous and friendly and encouraged us to return (which we did) for yet another good burger in a favorite spot, without any issues at all.  My original review never posted, so I include it here:  \"A family favorite generally (we are regulars), tonight they had an epic fail.  They served my daughter's special burger complete with the small paper dispensing cup (which had held the burger's cheese sauce) smashed into the bun.  It neither tasted good nor looked too good, even if it offered extra fiber.  And the advertised prosciutto had been substituted with pastrami.  My burger had no extra meat at all, neither prosciutto nor pastrami.  They agreed to comp a burger and a shake, but the bill they delivered was only for the burger and shake - a bill I should have paid:  when I pointed  out the error they gave me another, much higher, bill.  WAY below standards for Michael Symon.\""}
{"text":"This place is always busy.  Never able to find a parking at Eton.  I usually order the Lola burger and beacon shake.  The porky fries are good to share also.  Food is definitely good, but prices are not.  So 4 stars."}
{"text":"There are a TON of reviews for this place, so I'm sure I don't have to go into too much detail... so I'll keep it quick.  Great Burgers Good Beer Standard Service Fun Atmosphere / Cool Decor Pickle Bar thing is weird...   Worth checking out if you have not been here."}
{"text":"Great burgers however all the fried foods are fried with lard. Wish they didn't use it so I could have more than just burgers. Love the Fat Doug!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Thin Lizzy and Lola fries. I thought the burger was greasy and the meat was just average. I don't like a lot of toppings on burgers, no need to disguise the meat if it's good. A truly good burger you should be able to eat with nothing on it! The Lola fries were good. Liked the pickle bar. Service was just ok...But, I think it's a little pricy. I'll go to Great Lakes Brewery for my favorite burger on Cleveland! Love Michael Simon and what he does for Cleveland, but it is what it is...."}
{"text":"So, hit this one little over a week ago.  We got there around 5 pm ... yeah a bit early, but we were seated right away.  Me, my nephew his wife and their two year old son.  I ordered the Red Hot Burger asked for it medium figuring it would come out the same as when your order in S-ville.  But it came out with almost no pinkness.  Actually close to medium well done.  That's okay, I still enjoyed it.  It has a lil spice, but it's not really that hot.  Okay, nod to S-ville on the burgers.  Had the onion rings and fries which we shared.  Onions rings at Crocker were much, much better than S-ville.  S-ville's tend to be greasier and heavier.  Definite nod to Crocker on the rings. (Make's me wonder if S-ville is reusing their oil.  Was 2nd customer in S-ville this past Sunday and rings were greasy.)   Service was excellent, they popped a high chair in for my nephew lickedy split.   Despite all the hype on the fries, they are just okay.  I mean I ate them and all, but meh!  Fries at BBE are much, much better.  Service was fabulous and pickle bar is great.  Like Crocker B Spot better than S-ville because S-ville always has the music cranked too high.  I mean who wants to be blasted at 11:05 am on Sunday morning.  Last note, my friend had the \"Chick Magnet\"  chicken thingie at S-ville.  Said he would not order t again (really wonder about their oil).  But hey, it's a burger joint.  Oh, for those of you who call Crocker Park a strip mall, give it up.  Strip malls don't have parking garages.  Just because it is out doors and has an old 'main street' look ... well that doesn't make it a strip mall.  hahahaha do I detect Crocker Park envy?  Downgrading my rating after last two visits there.  Last one was Nov 12th (11/12/12)  The burgers are still top notch.  But the fries came limp and less than hot.  The porky fries were a mess.  We left most of the fries.  Service was slower and less friendly than in the past."}
{"text":"Okay, went there today.  Service was great.  Had a chocolate shake which lived up to the hype.  Great, rich, chocolatey flavor.  Had Hot Jack burger.  Cooked perfectly as I asked (medium rare).  Good sized portion, cheese perfectly melted.  Buckeyes are wimps, the burger was not hot (spicy)!  Not enough jalapenos, still I'd order again.  Meat was well flavored, but I would rate this burger -- although excellent -- to be of lesser quality than those served at Buckeye Beer Engine.  Only disappointment was the onion rings.  Fried perfectly but absolutely no taste except for a sweetness in the batter.  To paraphrase an old saw \"Where's the onion?\"  Easy to remedy this, skip the onion rings and get a shot of bourbon in the shake.  Next time I'll do that, cuz I love what Michael Symon does for the area.  I'll go back.  Service was exceptional.  Staff could not have treated me any better."}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate the service. Had a party of 5. Was told they won't put tables together. Was given this option (and I'm quoting): \"our picnic tables technically seat 6 but we know they really don't. You can seat 5 uncomfortably if you want to.\"  With her face she said that. I said - I'll take a table at Bar Louie 10 feet away."}
{"text":"Great food amazing Lola burger and onion rings!  Terrible service. Did not feel welcome. Hard to get refills and sweetener for tea.  Waitress acted out off by us!!!"}
{"text":"The Lola burger has to be the best burger in town. I sat at the bar and had great service. Jenna the bar tender was awesome. I asked what IPA's she had on draft and she rattled off all the names and where they were from. She even suggested a few for me. Great experience like always. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Fresh bun and beef. The pickle bar is tasty...  Only negative is no fries with the burger ... For $10 plus...  It should come with fries."}
{"text":"Bourbon, Apple, Bacon, Ice Cream.  This sounds like the dessert table at a Kentucky BBQ, but it isn't.  It is a milkshake at B Spot.  Michael Symon may be famous for Lola, but he will be remembered for B Spot.  Making simple, yet delicious everyman's food, B Spot is the place for a great burger.    Craving a Phili Cheesesteak?  No need to get to Philadelphia to get the flavors.  It's on his menu.  Need pastrami, cole slaw, and a burger.  Not only is it a wonderful picnic menu, but it is also known as one of the best burgers in the country with a great name, Fat Doug.  Need a bratwurst? No need to fire up the grill.  Those are on the menu too.    Never have I been more excited by a burger joint, but hell, I love this place.  Add in some fries with a healthy dose of pulled pork and cheez whiz and you my friends have one of the best side dishes in America."}
{"text":"The B Spot management team responded almost immediately to my complaint and comments on their website. They were totally professional and helpful. I tweeted about my negative experience after lunch and I was exchanging emails with Michael Symon before dinner.   Nobody's perfect, but these guys care and do their best."}
{"text":"Disappointing #BSpot experience tonight. My burger was severely over cooked, and my wife's was severely undercooked. So burgers is in the name, but they cannot do them well."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was awesome. The only thing is that they lost my boyfriend's credit card. One of the waitresses told me that wasn't the first time something like that happened. He was able to cancel right away so no harm done in that department. I got the thin Lizzy impossible burger and it was delicious? Tastes just like meet. The Lola fries are perfectly seasoned and definitely a favorite of mine now. I also, got the Elvis Presley milkshake which was so yummy."}
{"text":"I loved my Shroomage Burger and the service was great. I enjoyed the pickle bar and the bourbon in my Vanilla Bean, Bacon and Apple pie shake. I will definitely go back. BSpot kicks ass!"}
{"text":"Don't even question your decision - just go. Try the French Onion burger first, then work your way through the rest of the menu. This is a local fave and I place I frequent on the regular. Seriously, when I moved to the Cleveland area a few months ago I was so doubtful that I would find ANYTHING remotely good about Ohio...and then I found B Spot and my life was better.    The bottom line is this place serves an all around balanced burger. The bun tastes like it was made in a bakery that morning. The meat is fresh, juicy and seasoned. The combinations are unique, but not in the weird/gross way...in the \"this works really well\" way. They make their own pickles. They have a ton of unique and tasty homemade sauces. The atmosphere is super trendy and laid back. I'm not a drinker, but they have an endless beer menu.   If you are looking for a delicious, unique, not-fast-food-but-not-super-expensive burger, then this is where you want to go. Oh by the way, burgers are half off M-F from 3-6 pm!"}
{"text":"B Spot: My first experience with the culinary greatness that is Michael Symon. This restaurant is fun & exciting-from the garage doors that open to the street to the beer cans that form a giant \"B\" on the wall.   We came on a Thursday night and had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. Our server, Jackie greeted us warmly-I immediately felt comfortable. After talking about Chicago and chatting it up with the ever so amazing Jackie, we ordered our food.  Since all food comes to your table at once, we got:  -porky fries: lola fries covered in jalapenos, cheese & pulled pork(YUM!) -The hotty bratwurst: loaded with banana peppers, jalapenos & Symon's signature \"shasha\" sauce. Perfection. -The Fat Doug burger: set atop an amazing bun with pastrami, coleslaw & swiss cheese. divine. -We somehow also got convinced into ordering a milshake-the apple bacon milshake to be exact. Wow. The little bits of bacon were sometimes a little too chewy, but the shake was creamy & rich.   B Spot is a definitey \"to-do\" while in the Cleveland area. So happy I was able to visit it on my roadtrip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"As a Cleveland and a supporter of all things Cleveland its really hard to NOT root for guys like Michael Symon to succeed. Having said this. the only way I wouldn't give B-Spot at least 4 Stars is if it were owned by a Steelers fan. (JK)           THE GOOD: What's not to like?? the atmosphere is great. The menu is actually pretty diverse. The Drink selections is great, with tons of awesome beers on draft, and the milkshakes are perhaps the highlight of every visit...... Whoever decided to create a vanilla bean/ apple pie/bacon milkshake is a God amongst men. it is amazing.            THE DOWNSIDES: There are a few things I would change.... The beer selection is great but a one who much prefers draft beers all the beers are listed together on the menu cans/bottles/draft. So sometimes I find a beer I love only to discover its in a bottle and not on draft. The only other drawback might be that they ask you to place your entire order at once. We played by the rules and started our meal off with milkshakes. Great shakes, but I would have preferred to make the Bad Ass shake a desert. I'm hoping that if we had asked that they would have held the shakes off, but we didn't, the server didn't say anything about it and thats how the order came out.           At the end of the day, I will be going back time and time again. B-Spot is a great place to grab drinks, dinner with friends, or even a casual date spot. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"French fried was okay... but I liked the pickles bar!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Burger and this is a great atmosphere to be in.  A very cool pickle bar and there is a shake that is absolutely borderline illegal.  The Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon.........ARE YOU KIDDING ME.......You have to try this.  You going to say Bacon in a shake!!!!!!  But when you try this you are going to get hooked.  I have done the Lola Burger a few times and am stuck on this burger.  A fried egg on a burger is just too good.  I mean look at this combination....Lola burger with fried egg, bacon, pickled red onions, cheddar and mayo........HOOKED  Also the one thing the beef is raised naturally from http://lafrieda.com/  Check out the B-Spot menu here : http://www.bspotburgers.com/menu/"}
{"text":"I love me the B Spot. Delicious burgers cooked to perfection, interesting ingredient combinations, and amazing craft beers on tap.   Love the pickle bar, love the beer, love the burgers.   I actually create my own burgers there. None of the pre-designed options have ever really stood out to me."}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  I work in the same \"mall\" as B-spot, and several of us decided to get carry out for lunch one day.  The menu selections read great, and all sound delicious, but the execution in a word SUCKS.  I would at least expect hand pattied burgers with maybe a little seasoning in them, instead it looked like a cookie cutter hockey puck that Applebees would be serving.  Unless Michael Simon only put a B effort into this joint, he shouldn't be proud of this at all.  My burger lacked any seasoning on it at all, and the french fries were packed in a styrofoam cup so by the time we walked all 100 yards back to work, they were closer to steamed unmashed potatoes.  Have to admit the flavor on the two I ate was indeed great, but working in a restaurant for years, you have to put some effort into your togo food as well.  We didn't go for a half hour car ride, it was in the same mall, and the burgers and fries all seemed like they had no love.  I think that if he went to his own restaurant and ordered a burger and reviewed it like he does as a critic, he would tell this place to keep the menu, and get someone who actually cares in the kitchen.  PS your an iron chef, get some wild game burgers, think inside the bun, outsid ethe box a little more, anyone sould slap bacon, italian meats, cheese, and heavenly pig on a mediocre burger.  You might have had a big break as a big chef, but you can't alienate the clientele with your Symon says, kind of a D-bag move there."}
{"text":"Not sure about these other reviews but I felt the need to do a review on this strongsville bspot: absolutely excellent every time we have been here and we have been here at least 5 or 6 times with different people and have tried different things on the menu and have not been disappointed at all. Price is great for what you are getting.  I know there are probably places that are supposed to be better but I have tried others that claim are great but I still believe that this place is soo worth trying"}
{"text":"The service was really good, but I'm sure it helps that we came for lunch at 2pm on a Tuesday.  I love love love the idea of a pickle bar, and this one was pretty amazing.  The pickled green tomatoes were excellent.  The burgers and fries, however, were just meh to me.  I guess I was expecting a burger so good it would turn me into a burger lover, which is probably an unrealistic standard.  But I have now had a B Spot burger and am still pretty apathetic about burgers,"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of splitting the Lola burger, Yo! burger, Mr. Porky bratwurst, and vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake. Yes, that's right friends-- we did some serious menu exploring at B Spot.   The Lola burger was delicious: fried egg, bacon, pickled red onion, and cheese. Need I say more?   The best part of the Yo! burger was by far the many slices of fried salami that were jammed on top-- scrumptiously salty, crispy, and a perfect addition to the sandwich.  The burger meat itself is pretty good. They could definitely benefit from higher quality meat, but I imagine a sizeable price jump from that kind of change... and no one wants to see that.  The brat was packed with some surprising flavors- some good, some not so good. The pork seemed to have spent some time in an acidic and briny cooking liquid. While I'm a big fan of acidity with savory, there's gotta be a limit somewhere. The bratwurst itself was much more flavorfull than I expected; I swear I even tasted a hint a white wine in there.  And now for the kicker: Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon Milkshake. Yes, that is all one thing. And yes, it was ubber good-- a vanilla bean milkshake with a scoop of apple pie blended into it, topped with extra crispy bacon bits. I'd say this was one of the most imaginitive and satisfying combinations of sweet and salty I've ever had!  I went in super excited to finally eat at one of Michael Symon's restaurants, and I left with a fully belly and a smile on my face."}
{"text":"B Spot was a recommendation from my brother who lives in Cleveland, since I was in the mood to try something new during my recent trip north of Cincinnati. This B Spot has quickly covered a lot of the Cleveland area already as we saw they even had a spot in our clubhouse seats at the Browns vs Packers game but this experience was for their location in Strongsville.  We were seated immediately to a cozy but super unique restaurant. Once you get inside your eyes are drawn to the wall where they have beers stacked up to create the letter \"B.\" There were a lot of fun details in this burger joint that we really enjoyed pointing out throughout dinner.  I was super craving some rose that I didn't even care I would be ordering it to pair with a burger. The waitress didn't even judge me either which brings me to the service here - it is really what kept the stars so high because the food was meh.  They have A LOT of unique and fun burger options here and you can even BYOB too. I am a sucker for bbq burger so I went for the Porky which was a burger topped with pulled pork, cheddar, cole slaw and bbq sauce. Both of us paired our burgers with a side of Lola fries too (which were HUGE and I would recommend splitting if you go).  After placing our order we were taken back by all these milkshakes people were getting and YOU COULD FILL THEM WITH BOOZE! Yes boozy milkshakes and burgers - this was real. I can't handle much dairy so I opted out but my boyfriend immediately picked up the milkshake menu and was drawn to the chocolate banana marshmallow and he knew he had to get it, even if it was to-go.  Once our burger arrived both of us were not super impressed. They were really dry and we tried pairing them with some of the condiments on the table and none of them were \"normal\" and paired well with our burgers. Also I was unsure how my burger with Cole slaw and bbq could be so dry but it was. I was unable to finish most of mine because it just wasn't what I was expecting. The fries were tasty and covered in rosemary, a nice pairing to a savory burger.  Like I said the service is really what kept the stars so high on this one but the burgers didn't leave us wanting more. Zach did get his shake to go though (without the booze) and he really enjoyed it! When in Cle and you happen upon this spot - I'd suggest grabbing some fries and a boozy milkshake and calling it a day!"}
{"text":"The best hamburger I have ever had in my life. It was just outstanding with the flavors and tastes that you never thought existed.   Their buns were full, fluffy, moist and were sooooo tasty. Their meat was cooked perfectly, joocy, soft, flavorful. Oh and their sauces, tasted amazing.   The service was excellent too, they were friendly, attentive and helpful. Will totally come back here again when I visit OH in the future.   Well done chef Michael Simons."}
{"text":"Just had happy hour diner. Awesome prices!!! Check it out great food!!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay.  I'm beginning to think that I was just a miserable person when I was pregnant. Every review was tainted by my nausea, extreme hunger, and inability to imbibe. So now I return to this review to add another star.  My husband decided that we would go back to B Spot for another early, casual Valentine's Day meal. We hadn't been back since last year at this time, and we just decided to make this a tradition.  The fact that we had a baby with us was NOT a big deal, as B Spot is family friendly. Unlike the extremely uncomfortable high-top by the door we got last time, we were given a spacious booth this time around. And we were seated immediately. This ain't no Melt anymore.  Our waiter was great and NOT pretentious. We got a whole bunch of shit. Everything was mouth-wateringly PERFECT. Plus this time I could appreciate the depth and variety of their beer menu. Damn! Left hand milk stout on tap always deserves a mention.   And I only wish we could have taken the spiked versions of our big-ass shakes to go ... But obviously not. It's okay, we have Kahlua at home. And I plan to use it."}
{"text":"I decided to come here after being a fan of another Michael Symon restaurant, Lolita.  I was greatly disappointed.  I am a big fan of good hamburgers and was simply not impressed.  I had the cheeseburger and my gf had the thin lizzy.  The bun was too big and overwhelmed the meat.  The meat wasn't terribly flavorful or juicy.  I felt the service was nothing special.  I also found the list of \"rules\", especially the one about no substitutions or additions, to be particularly inane."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, boubons cost an extra buck if you want it on ice. That's BS!"}
{"text":"Best part about this place is the pickle bar and all the housemade sauces that allow you to really build yoir burger just how you like. Beer list is great and the service was spot on as well. Only miss was that the burger waa ordered medium and didnt even have a hint of pink. Hopefully a burger spot can cook one properly but flavor was good and rings and fries were good as well."}
{"text":"Michael Simon hit a grand slam when he blessed the state of Ohio with this magnificent gem. These burgers are absolutely to die for. Words cannot clearly explain the level of heaven that your mouth reaches when eating one of these burgers.  The milkshakes should have their own hall of fame. The creativity used to craft these is quite remarkable. My only regret is that there isn't any near the Akron or Canton area. I Love B Spot!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had any problems with B Spot and I really can say that I look forward to coming here when I can for more than just the fact that it's a Michael Symon restaurant.   First, the burgers are delicious and if you order them done a specific way, you can be sure you'll get it done to perfection. On the same token, I'm a bit disappointed that the whole \"this is how you get it and suck it up\" campaign is over. I believe in juicy pink burgers and that was the way they were all served \"back in the day\". Obviously, I'll still order mine pink, but the novelty of this place has been dulled by the loss of that rule. I love the Thin Lizzy, but the YO! is even more amazing if you're feeling a crazier burger. Second, the fries. They're thin, seasoned and a perfect little snack to go along with your burger. Come here hungry so you can have both!   The happy hour. Oh, gosh, the happy hour. I once spent $13 on 2 beers, a burger and fries--and they were all delicious, not bottom rung frozen, then cooked to tastelessness foods or cheap-o college beers. I'd recommend this happy hour to everyone. There's no reason not to give B Spot a try with these kinds of deals to snag.   Major disappointment: the pickle bar. I'm pickle crazed and see so much more potential here.   The service has always been good and everyone seems pleasant when I come here. I can't complain about much other than the fact that everyone seems to be a little all over the place when it comes to hostessing, but I generally head for the bar, so those problems are at a minimum."}
{"text":"The B Spot is a sold burger joint that has a distinct Cleveland feel. The pickle bar with a wide variety of pickle flavors makes this place truly unique.  Burger was alright, but the chorizo I asked for as a topping was dry.  The egg was perfectly soft as a topping."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger that I can remember ever having. I have ordered take out and dined in several times at this location and I have never had bad service, bad food or a bad experience of any kind. This is not my favorite take out place, it's much better right out the kitchen.   I do not care for their drink selection, so I learned to just stick with soda when dining in. I love all their burgers, haven't been able to try any brats because I'm so happy the burgers I can't seem to try anything else. I also adore their cheesy pulled pork fries. I have to have them every time I eat here.   Only complaint is they are really pricey for a burger. I have spent less on my meal when ordering filet mignon, so they could be a couple bucks cheaper. But I really enjoy taking non foodies here so they can see what its like dining out when stepping out of their comfort zone (i.e. Applebees, Red Lobsert and Friday's lol) and they can't stop telling me how it's the best burger ever."}
{"text":"All you need is the bacon milkshake--YUM! We were visiting Cleveland from New York and always make it a point to stop at B Spot. The burgers are pretty good, Fries are awesome and the staff is friendly, knowledgable and attentive. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I've long wanted to try one of Michael Symon's places, and having recently moved from LA, I was looking forward to checking out B Spot. I have to say, I don't get the hype on this one. The server was awesome and friendly but food was slow coming out (burger and fries). I kept telling myself it would be worth the wait, it's not fast food. But... it really wasn't worth it. The rosemary fries were kinda cold, so not that delicious. The burger had a cold bun. The burger was tasty but not the best I've ever had or anything. Umami burger in LA is better. The chairs are super uncomfortable, too. Why do restaurants love these tall chairs where your feet dangle and your back aches? I'd go again if I was with someone who was dying for this place, but probably not on my own."}
{"text":"Good, but not great burgers.  The star of our meals has always been the rosemary seasoned thin fries...cannot get enough of these.  I am also a fan of the pickle bar which contains a number of briny-goodness items to choose from which can be used to \"decorate\" your burger.  As for the burgers themselves, I have never been blown away by the quality of the cooking temperature...most likely due to the thin nature of the patties.  I find most of their burgers to be on the medium to medium-well side and I am a medium-rare burger lover.  Toppings are good 'n messy, but there are plenty of other great burger places around Cleveland I'd rather go."}
{"text":"Decent New Jack burger. Thin fries, though could use more spices. Pickle bar. Variety of choices for drinks that aren't too shabby."}
{"text":"Wildly mediocre.   My burger arrived medium, as ordered, but was stunningly devoid of juiciness despite it's still-pink interior. My mom's burger was fully well-done despite also being ordered medium.   Fries and onion rings were good...mmmm, lard-cooked...but not great. And the fries were way overpriced for the small portion. Potatoes aren't exactly a high-end ingredient.   Service was slow and indifferent. And I'm still perplexed why we had a 15 minute wait, despite open tables, during lunch time on a weekend. Necessary for the faux-exclusive image?  Oh, yeah. Several ketchups and sauces were on the table, but I declined to try any. The spouts were all crusted up with old sauce and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a long time."}
{"text":"I will say the my burger was great, however the service was terrible. Beyond terrible. I was there for lunch and sat at the bar, where there was only one other person sitting. The bartender took my drink order and then forgot about it while she casually chatted with the other staff at the end of the bar. At the end I paid my $17 check with a $50 and the bartender shorted me when she gave me my change back, then was annoyed when I asked her to double check and correct it. I don't know if she thought I wouldn't notice that she shorted me over ten bucks or what, but I am in the service industry, and their lack of professionalism was absurd. Way to drop the ball, B Spot."}
{"text":"Got the red hot, amazing. Can't wait till next time"}
{"text":"Love the burgers here! The Lola Burger is my favorite. I've had a few of the shakes, and the Vanilla Apple Pie & Bacon is the BEST (especially with the bourbon!).   The pickle bar is nice - I've liked most everything on there.  (The kimchi wasn't as great to me last time, but is normally tasty.)  Everyone should definitely try this out!  (I hear the Strongsville location is the best :) )"}
{"text":"I thought this place was on point!  food: burgers were moist and delicious and the price was right. I had the Yo! burger, I loved that they had a pickle bar inside! Also, the balsamic steak sauce was to die for!!! The onion rings and fries were crispy and tasty!  Ambiance: We sat outside because the inside was a little dark for us. The beer can structure was really cool though!  Service: Service was good, waiter's were friendly and food came pretty fast!     Overall: If i'm in the Cleveland area again i'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have to honestly say the food itself is great-but the service and restaurant completely took away from the experience. Here were some high (or low) lights:  -The one single sex bathroom was overflowing and would not flush (and dirty inside) -We received the wrong check when trying to pay -When we ordered milkshakes, we were basically told \"good luck\" on pouring it into the cup...even when we asked for help...then we saw other tables it was poured for them.  I traveled in from out of town to try this place and just was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best burgers! This place is well known for their famous burgers. Price is affordable for the big burgers. I also tried the milkshakes and you can add alcohol on them! Really a good spot to hang out and have some nice burger."}
{"text":"Always a good time. Great beer selection and excellent bratwurst. I really like the Clevelander. The bologna sandwiches pretty good too. I wish they would bring back happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here on weds, 4:30 pm no wait at all cool! The design of the place is really cool. I love the beer can colleague on the wall very cool. Now here where the 2 stars come from, I have never been to a restaurant that I left still hungry after paying $12 for my meal. The burger is pretty good but a big mac at McDonald is bigger, and the pitiful amount of fries for $4 add on was a joke. I really wanted to love this place but the more I think about it you are way better off going across the street to five guys, the burgers are just as good if not better and are what $5. I'm def not rushing back here anytime soon, and if I do I'm getting the onion rings which they give you a lot of at least, but are also sub par at best. Michael stick to fancy food!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Great fries! The shakes are so yummy. Come hungry and be prepared for a little bit of a wait. They are usually pretty busy during peak hours."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service seemed kinda off.  If I'm in the area, I'd come back. Hopefully the service will better."}
{"text":"When we showed up for lunch we had high expectations for Michaels food. That being said, his  food was amazing and never disappoints.  But the service was lacking. We want to comment about your hostess and staff and how rude and uncomfortable they made my boyfriend and I feel the minute we walked in. They didn't offer us a table to sit at instead she recommended we sit at the bar. We didn't want to sit there so we asked if we could have a table. She seemed ticked off and took us to the back of the restaurant which made us feel very unwelcome. We'll definitely come back, just hope the staff will make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"We have been here 5 times now. The first time I came I thought it was good but didn't see what all the fuss is about. Over time though, I have found out what really works here. The fries are weak IMO. Symon is not very good with the fries here or at Lola. They are like matchsticks and not all that tasty. The quality of the meat in the burger is top notch and the bun has just the right texture. Any of the burgers are good if you put some of the complimentary coffee BBQ sauce on them. This sauce would make shoe leather dance. It is delicious and he should have it in the super market. After staying away for my first couple visits I finally had the Fat Doug that everyone raves about. Coleslaw, pastrami, swiss and mustard? Really? It did not sound that good to me... I was wrong. This burger is especially addictive. Combine that with a vanilla bean, apple pie, bacon milkshake and life is good. Gotta like the free pickle bar too."}
{"text":"I think the burgers are OK here, but not the best. Good though when you're looking for something different to try. The chips and fries as sides are so-so and it's kind of annoying that you can't order things as an appetizer apparently in order to keep the kitchen running fast. The beer selections are pretty good, but not the best happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Decent burgers but they are on the smaller side and they are expensive as hell.  I like the food and love the pickle bar...they actually have really good Kim Chi, which is Korean pickled cabbage.  I personally get the atomic burger which is super spicy which I really enjoy.  It is the kind of spicy where if you aren't ready for it you'll have the hiccups.  The food is good but the restaurant is way overrated because it is Michael Symon's place."}
{"text":"ZERO stars.  Why zero, you ask?  Because we didn't even get to try the food here.  Apparently they have a \"strict corporate policy\" about not serving appetizers...  and we were hungry!    So here's what happened:  A friend and I went there for dinner this evening and right after we sat down, her sister called - so we invited her to join us.  When we tried to order some chips with our drinks while we were waiting, we were told that WE COULD NOT ORDER JUST AN APPETIZER we had to order all our food at once.   Our server said her manager would not allow her to place our order unless that was all we would be eating this evening.  Seems kind of strange that you would discourage customers from ordering - but that was the deal.  We explained that someone else would be joining us and that we wanted to order dinner later - and we were told that we shouldn't have been seated until our entire party had arrived.  (Well, we WERE the entire party when we were first seated!).   My friend politely told the waitress that this was absurd.  As the server left to get the manager, we walked out.    I mean, really?  We didn't want to drink without some food to go along with the alcohol, and we didn't want to wait until our third person arrived before ordering so we gave up and walked across the street to Bar Louie.  They were not only happy to serve us WHATEVER we wanted WHEN we wanted it, they had great happy hour drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers!  (bonus!)    (If you haven't tried Bar Louie's fried calamari, I strongly suggest you do so at the very next opportunity.)  But I've been ruminating all evening.. WHY this policy?  I don't get it.  Instead of selling a few apps, several beers plus dinners - easily a $100 tab with tip -  they got nothing.  What do they gain by having this rule?  If anyone reading this has a clue, Please let me know!"}
{"text":"Good burgers prepared in unique ways. Really good beer selection. I get a salad with a burger on it. Shoestring French fries are really good."}
{"text":"Some of the most creative burgers ever. Also has great brats and milk shakes. Must order fries on the side. I would recommend the onion rings instead though. Great beer menu too."}
{"text":"For all the hullaboo this place generates, I'm not overly impressed! They do a good burger - yes. However, they really do not have anything for vegetarians, and can't cook a standard burger medium well (it was cooked well done at best - completely brown through and through). Good fries and shakes though.   Basically I would not mind going back, but wouldn't seek it out as the holy grail for a burger."}
{"text":"Last year I would have given the B-Spot a 4-5 star rating, but the Turkey burger was inedible (think reconstituted chicken patty then over cooked) and my nephew's mini burgers were charred to death. Gone down hill on quality."}
{"text":"Always excellent burgers that are always cooked to a perfect medium.. Decent draft selection too."}
{"text":"Always excellent burgers that are always cooked to a perfect medium.. Decent draft selection too."}
{"text":"The best burger I have had in a long time. I had a burger with mushrooms and caramelized onions on top. Scrumptious! The burger was packed with flavor. We also had the apple pie and bacon shake. It was delicious and big enough for 3 to share."}
{"text":"A great concept with great-tasting burgers with lots of extras.  It's expensive. But because I know Symon goes out of his way to use local, responsibly-raised beef, I won't complain. You know the prices going in, and you know the quality of the food is high. I remember him writing on Facebook once something like: \"if you feel you have to order a burger well done to make sure it's safe to eat, why are you eating that meat in the first place.\" Good point.  I ordered the \"Fat Doug,\" cooked medium. Ridiculous. Pastrami, coleslaw, swiss and mustard. Dipped it in the Lola Ketchup, with has a nice smoky, spicy taste.  The burger didn't look that large when it came. I finished the first half fast, had a few onion rings and fries, then barely was able to finish the second half. It was such a good burger, folks. So juicy and flavorful. The toppings didn't take over the burger, they elevated it.  The onion rings, compared to most restaurants are far above average. However, they're not close to the best. You have to go to Bishop's Fine Food in Orrville, Ohio for those. Bishop's batter is unrivaled, and it sells bags of it in Buehlers groceries if you ever want to try it. I recommend making the trip to the corner of 57 and 30 sometime.  The worst part of this meal was the drive home to Cuyahoga Falls. I got home and passed out for an hour - my body's way of telling me it needed me to get out of the way so it could enjoy digesting one of the best greasy meals I've had in a while.  I'm not a huge fan of shoestring fries, but the seasoning on these made them pretty tasty. Another plus is the pickle bar, with some regional favorites (Tony Packo's sweet and spicies) and the six sauces on every table, including the tangy Shasha yellow sauce.   I'll be back in a few months and share a burger with my friend."}
{"text":"Burger was small. Fries were ok. In n Out Burgers are better and half the price. Service was ok."}
{"text":"B Spot in my opinion is a solid 3 stars.  Burgers are ok, nothing great.  If you want a GREAT burger in Cleveland, head to Flip Side or Tremont Tap House.  Service on the patio is slow.   The pricing is high for the quality of food.  But then again, you are paying for Michael Symon's name...not worth it in my opinion when there are way better places to eat (even a few doors down at Taza!)"}
{"text":"The thing about B-Spot for me, is that it touts to be a burger joint, but the B kinda stands for Bar rather than burger. They're creative, yes, but the meat of the burger itself just falls short.   Oddly enough, its the rest of the menu that shines. Apple bacon caramel milkshake? Proof that bacon is one of about 5 ingredients that go with everything. The sriracha wings are easily the best wings in Cleveland that I've ever had, and the fries are just killer.  The bartenders are always nice quick and chatty when you sit there, and for all the people complaining about not getting a regular burger is like yelling out \"Play Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at a Primus (or any unique band) concert. You don't go to a fancy italian restaurant and order spaghetti and meatballs. If you want a boring burger, you should have went to Burger King.  But despite all the relative praise, its all beside the point that this was supposed to be the Burgers, Beer, and Bar Spot, and it doesn't quite make it. The bar is excellent, yes, but its far outweighed by the fact that it doesn't FEEL like a bar like other quirky cleveland staple bar/restaurants do. And with all the time put into the decor, its perfectly legitimate to weigh this in (normally I couldn't care less). The beer selection is the only part of the 3 B's that holds up. However, the biggest disappointment here are the burgers. Fabulous buns, flavorful ingredients; I could still taste the fried salami and sasha sauce on my Yo! burger after the inferno of sriracha wings. But the burger meat itself just tasted like a lump of ground meat. And I'd expect a chef as well versed as Symon to know that burgers need some fat, or else they're just bland crumbly hunks of meat. I'd like to give a higher rating, and would give 3 1/2 if I could, but this is like going to see some guitar hero, and walking home from the concert saying \"he was ok, I guess... but the drummer and bassist were just GREAT!\""}
{"text":"First things first: B Spot has more than burgers. A few salad/sandwich options, and (important for me) non-beef burger options, both turkey and veggie. I got a custom made turkey burger with egg and avocado, and my girlfriend got the Gobbler. Fries aren't included with burgers, so we got a side order of them.  The burgers were thick (easily a 1/3 lb, probably more), hot, and at our table within 5 minutes. They were deliciously messy, but not so messy that you just end up eating it off your plate with a fork.  The fries weren't bad, but we didn't really have room for them. If I had to nitpick something, it would be that the sauces provided at the table aren't very good. I didn't feel a need to use them though; it's not worth subtracting a star."}
{"text":"I actually wasn't sure that this is a Michael Symon place until looking at Yelp - but it makes sense given that there's a \"Lola Burger\" on the menu and that the food quality is outstanding.  It certainly isn't cheap which takes it down from 5 to 4 stars but on multiple visits the burgers have been top quality, cooked perfectly every time, with great flavor combinations, and the fries & onion rings are pretty good too.  A colleague of mine from NYC goes here every week and after a couple visits I can understand why, certainly don't go here expecting a healthy meal but if you're looking for a great burger I've found it every time at B Spot."}
{"text":"Ok! I now have hit I think every Symon restaurant he has.  Went today with my 16 year kiddo who HAD to go to the new Crocker Park locale before she shipps off to Europe for a year, yeah like they don't have hamburgers in Europe...  LOVE the B spots. one hitch, I have had the wonderful Pat La Frieda  beef before, but I think the crew on the line needs a little more seasoning. I know Michael cooks his burgers a little more rare than medium. Heck,I love carpaccio, but this was practically mooing...unfortunately I had to send it back to be recooked just a tad ( sorry Chef). I also would prefer that you could get some \"appetizers\". I know he doesn't do that at Lola with it all coming out at once...  Today I had the Hot Stuff ( ?) and my teen had the schroomage...again. all in all very good, but It's funny, I think I am beginning to like LESS stuff on my burgers.  What WAS truly lovely were the in house made potato crisps with rosemary cheese fondue! OMG! Even to break one day on the Atkins diet for me...I'll pay tomorrow for the hamburger and crisps I ate today...  Michael, awesome as always, but I have learned to order my burgers medium in your auto shop cum ski lodge /man cave...  the crisps and fondue...to die for!"}
{"text":"I have only been to this place once and let me tell you its out of this world but the only draw back of it is if you put in your reservation to get in line for a table once a table becomes available you either take it or wait for the next available table which could be 30 minutes or longer down the road. The reason I say this is because this place is so popular its not easy getting a table not because of the location buts its famouse for its Burgers.      Make sure you plan accordingly on you and your party showing up."}
{"text":"B-B-B bacon!  in their shakes! first of all, this is one delicious burger, I could care less who the \"celebrity chef\" is, I'm from LA, so really, name dropping is a little lame in my book.  But DAMN! that's a tasty burger, their fries, are unique, and their chips are good, but their dip is a little garlicky.  Delicious shakes (we tried the chocolate with kalhua, and the vanilla, apple pie, bacon shake) We truly enjoyed the meal, at a great price (about 15 dollars a person, with the shakes)"}
{"text":"great atmosphere and another great restaurant by Michael Symon and a must try at least once. Burgers are quality over quantity and great staff. Also try a Bad A** Shake too..."}
{"text":"Know what chaps my ass?  French fries that aren't fresh.  And you know they have been sitting around.  Imagine the delicious rosemary Lola fries arriving to your table...barely warm and stale.  So I asked the server to please bring us some FRESH French fries and he did.  Come on dude...even Mc Donald's has a buzzer that goes off when food has been sitting in a warming drawer or tray too long.  My Lola burger was....snooze...nothing great.  I can get a better burger at Red Robin actually.  Perhaps the most irritating?  We asked to order fries \"to start\" for the table.  Our server politely told us they don't serve appetizers or courses.  HUH?  But...B Spot has no problem serving old French fries.  Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! I expected the burgers to be better than Burger King, but sadly not. Service was slow, and lethargic. Won't be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting B Spot and after hearing nothing but great things about it, I was excited to go with some friends of mine. We went around 7:30 on a Tuesday night and were seated right away. Our drink orders were placed with a server who was not ours; it took our actual server maybe 15-20 minutes to come out and she never even introduced herself to us. The menu was very interesting but there weren't many options for a super picky eater like me (my friends loved it though!). I ended up getting a basic bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked to perfection. The french fries were delicious seeing as I love shoestring fries! My only complaint is that they were not served with the burger and were an additional $4. Overall it was a very fun and casual place to eat out. I probably won't be back to this location since it was a pretty far drive, but if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely keep it in mind."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the setup and the staff. I like the atmosphere both inside and out, and the staff was tremendous. They were quick, courteous, got everything correct and even brought out a cupcake for our 15 month old.  As for the food... Michael, what happened? You watch Michael Symon on TV and you hear he has a burger joint and you get excited... then you get there and the fries, while wonderfully seasoned, are just glorified potato stix (thin, hard). Not to mention they cost extra to get.  The burger? Well, they're tiny. The meat part that is. Six ounces before cooking. I'm not even sure I believe that. They try to fool you by putting a bunch of toppings on, but there's no denying the look of a burger where the bun is more than twice as thick as the patty (see picture).   They give you the option to add a second patty which would make it a normal size burger, but now you're getting to $20 for a so-so cheeseburger and fries before toppings, drink, tip or taxes ($8.99 for a regular burger + $5.99 for an extra patty + $3.99 for fries).   Maybe this is the real Michael Symon. I don't know. But TV Michael Symon - an apparent expert in burgers - would be sending this chef home if this were put in front of him on one of those cooking shows."}
{"text":"Meh, the food was ok, nothing impressive. Service was very good and attentive.   I created my own burger with bologna, cheese sauce and grilled onions. The bun couldn't hold up the burger, bottom completely disintegrated. The fries were as expected from being to Lolas previously. The chicharrons were perfect, crispy and well seasoned.  I found the pickle bar disappointing and kind of gimmicky."}
{"text":"I think our expectations going in were kind of high knowing this is a Michael Symon restaurant even though it specializes in burgers.  We were in no way disappointed in the visit.  The food was perfect.  The pickle bar is a great touch and one we had never seen before.  The fries were the best I have ever had.   The prices are reasonable and actually a great value.   The B Spot has great atmosphere, great menu, and service was flawless.  Definitely somewhere we would return to as soon as we can. Please open one in my hometown!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the drinks, as I stopped in with friends on opening night after having eaten next door at Paladar...  1) Great selection of beers 2) Vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake.  Do I need to say more?  I do?  OK, OK... how about you can get it with a shot of bourbon?  If that doesn't sound like heaven in a glass, I don't know what does"}
{"text":"When i step off the airplane at Hopkins airport I go to B spot as soon as possible.  I have to drive about 30 minuts to get to this slice of heaven and its worth every minute.  The vibe of B Spot is perfect casual.  If you are a first timer, follow these three easy steps.  Grab a stool at the bar (all the bartwnders are nice), order a Lola burger (add Lola ketchup once served), order a Brew Free or Die IPA.    In all of my travels I put B Spot near the top of my list.  Cheeseburgers are one of my favorite food categories, B Spot is top 3 in the country hands down.  Michael Symon is a good guy too, which comes through in every aspect of B Spot.  The food, beer, decor, and staff all benefit from Michael's influence.  I am back in Austin for a while, but Spring time means the another visit to see the Indians and a couple stops at B Spot."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for a table while the hostess put other people ahead of us with a fake attitude regarding the delay. No manager to be seen. Food okay, service mediocre. Had to ask server for kids cupcakes like it was an option rather than with their meals. Pushed my patience."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner with family and were really disappointed.  We were in a party of 6 and the server added an automatic gratuity.  While I understand the policy, I do not think our server actually deserved half of the gratuity.  Service was slow, subpar, and he never checked on us.  All of our burgers were undercooked.  We never got a chance to tell him because some other person dropped off our food.  It took him over 10 min to come and check on us and by that point we caved it and already had eaten half our food.  The burgers and salad themselves were too salty as well, which was disappointing since the food is a bit over priced.    Overall, it was not an enjoyable experience for our group and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The burgers here are excellent, however I feel that all of the food is a bit overpriced. Both of the burgers were of adequate size and tasty, however the burgers are a la carte, so we ordered two orders of fries, as our waitress seemed quite unsure of the size, and how many people could normally be fed with an order (and 2 people can be fed on 1 order of fries as a side). We came here during Cleveland Beer Week to test out the brewery that was spotlighted that night, which was MadTree from Cincinnati. My fiance had the Nacho Burger which she enjoyed, and I felt gave a nice concoction of flavors. I had the New Jack City which had chorizo, avocado, salsa verde, red peppers, and onion. Solid burger, but at the price (when figuring in it's a la carte) seemed a bit high to me. Excellent beer selection as well as a large variety of bourbon as well. During a happy hour I would consider coming back, but otherwise I'd probably choose another restaurant."}
{"text":"We love B Spot.  I'm not sure how much we'll get there now that we have a little one, as it's not super kid friendly and packed tight.  I adore their outside seating so maybe that will work.  I also miss the Red Hot burger dearly but I'm pretty much able to recreate it now that they have the build your own option.  We love taking out of towners here and they love the milkshakes.  I really wish Michael would make a non-dairy milkshake.....  And, our service is always great!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and when I asked some Yelp people where I should go for a good burger, BSpot burgers was at the top of everyones list. These burgers are a Michael symon burger which won aards on 4 of the burgers on the menu. So in my mind I'm ready for this burger. My wife and I drove from Cleveland about 20 minutes to come to this spot, because I didnt want to eat at the one in the food court of the Hors shoe casino caffeteria. When we arrived I was so hungry and they were able to seat us right away. It took a few minutes for our waiter to come and greet us, but they were busy so no big deal. We places a drink for a 6 dollar beer which is normally a 4 dollar beer where we come from but whatever were on a trip so a couple dollars doesn't hurt anyone. The waiter who by the way was very nice very knowledgeable and very good to us. He explained the burgers to us and what they were known for. he explained that the burger did not come with fries that the price was just the burger, I'm sorry but if your going to charge 8 or more dollars for a burger it should come with fries. In my head I'm thinking this is going to be a good burger if it doesnt come with fries. I went ahead and got the Yo burger with fried salomi the way they worded the explanation of the burger was very good. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium rare. When they brought the burgers out they looked very small. quarter pound at the most. i topped the burger with the toppings i wanted. after a long delay and waite for whats supposed to be an award winning burger i bit in to find that my burger was not cooked to medium rare, not even medium, but medium well. which in any case should not destory a burger if your using good meat. but this meat was very dry and tasted like cardboard. which tells me one of two things. either they use frozen burgers/not fresh or they quality of meat is bad. I just wonder who is giving out awards for these burgers they must have no taste buds.  over all I was very happy with the service of this place. it is over priced for what you get. Reminded me of a bagger daves but less good, and I dont like bagger daves. Who knows maybe it was just a bad experience. If I go to cleveland again, I will probably retry it...."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to go here because the food pics on yelp looked delicious. When I started in on eating the food I was left kinda wishing I could eat the pics instead. Everything is presented well and it's a 'ok' value for the amount you get but not one bite of anything I had really made a impression beyond it being just something to chew on. Service was good and they have a neat little toppings bar where you can get pickles and onions but with all the delicious specialty burger places that have been popping up these past few years this place really needs to step up its game."}
{"text":"This place isn't all that it has been hyped up to be. It's good, but not great. I've tried a few of the burgers and liked them, tried the brats and they were decent and tried the beers which are good. It's a little overpriced for what it is, but most are willing to pay for a decent burger. The pickle bar isn't what it could be and usually messy. I would go again, but not a special trip."}
{"text":"Love this place! Just a bit loud for me but the burgers are to die for!! My favorite thing there are the rules..especially rule #1: NO Whining. Haha. Damn good Margarita too! Everyone in Cleveland should try this place at least once..it's part of the whole Cleveland experience."}
{"text":"We have eaten here about 15 times over the past few years, and make no mistake, the burgers are tremendous. My go-to burger is the Thin Lizzy - love me some mayo, cheddar, pickles, and caramelized onions.  We also love the shakes and sides. My wife has had the Chick Magnet chicken sandwich and I've tried the grilled cheese, both of which were pleasant surprises.  I gave it 4 stars only because they have removed a few of my favorite items from the menu - they used to have sriracha wings, which were excellent, and a really tasty chili (beanless). They also deep sixed the tomato soup with crouton and blue cheese, which is a shame.  All of those items were superb, and sometimes you just don't feel like a burger, or you and your SO can share some diverse things including a burger.  Anyway, it's great food, good value for the money, and I recommend checking it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Bring on the meat sweats!  Don't go here if you are afraid of grease or fat. Ohhhh, delicious fat.  Overall I think this is a very unique burger experience; certainly not your predictable \"stuff on the wall\" joint (though there is that) a la Friday's or Red Robin.   All orders come out at the same time. This place definitely feels built to move large numbers of people through its doors-- so I'd imagine the \"no starters, just all at one time\" rule is meant for keeping the customers seated, stuffed, and sold. Still, it was a little irritating when the wait was nonexistent and we just wanted some apps with our beers before we dug into our burgers.  The burgers were smaller than I expected, which I think is actually a good thing, considering how many calories are likely packed into such a tiny bundle. Bring it on, though!  At first I was sort of overwhelmed with all the burger choices, but then I began to notice a pattern-- many of the burgers have similar combinations of flavors. I ordered the Chef's Choice equivalent (with some cute name), and it came out with a good cross-section of everything I saw on the menu (salami, kraut, etc). Since there isn't anything I dislike, it was a low-risk choice for me.   The rosemary fries were awesome. Get them.  I didn't get the apple-pie/bacon/bourbon shake, but it's going in my belly next time... but maybe only after fasting for two weeks. Ha! I think a gym membership should come with your order."}
{"text":"B-Spot? Meh. I'm a fan - but I always leave wishing it would have been a little bit better. I've frequented the eastside location & found the westside location to be, well, exactly the same.  The pepper bar is one of the highlights for sure - perfect for loading your burger up with some banana peppers & jalapeños. Yum.  My favorite thing about B-Spot? The fact that their menu literally has an asterisk at the bottom (at least the online version does) that says \"We cook in lard.\" Oh, boy.  The Lola fries have a touch of Rosemary and are nicely salted. The Lola Ketchup on the other hand, I found to be somewhat yucky. The ShaSha sauce - some kind of hot-peppery goodness, is delish - I am a fan.  I will admit I miss Agave & the interior of this place, albeit now filled with empty beer cans configured in B on the wall, an antler chandelier, and ridiculously light-weight metal looking chairs - still kinda reminds me of the old place. Okay, it's probably because the bar is still in the same place and we all know that's where I spent a lot of time... but still. The patio is also still there so it's perfect for people watching (or creeping) while enjoying a delicious burger or brat.  I know some people are turned off by the laminated note on the table that lays out the rules for you - pretty much it says look, your food all comes out together, we'll make your food how we want (except we can take off whatever you're allergic to), don't try to add anything, and if you're offended that we're so blunt, you're uptight. So there. But, eh - nobody there has every really copped an attitude (at least with me). So, I think it's just part of the grungy, trendy, ski lodge, auto repair shop chic they have going on.  The vanilla, apple pie, bacon milkshake is delicious and filling, or so I'm told - but really how could you not love something that has BACON in it?? One item that does creep me out? The bologna sandwiches - it's literally like an inch thick piece of meat - heart attack city! But I'm sure it's delish. I've also had the chips which come with yummy Parmesan fondue cheese (also with a hint of rosemary, which I'm now assuming must be a fave of the Iron Chef). Speaking of which I hear that he rolls through about once a day - so if you're a \"celebrity\" stalker, you may get a chance to meet one.  I appreciate this yummy addition to Crocker Park & look forward to returning again and again.  Thanks Michael!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but if you get lucky enough to sit in the mall, on a Sunday night....be prepared to watch the floor cleaner buzz right by your table, very loud too! If you don't mind the mall clean up crew, watching you eat and running that dang floor machine, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Awesome fries, shakes and burgers!  Great beer selection, especially of craft beers.  You gotta try the shake with bacon and the fries with pulled pork!"}
{"text":"Ordered a glass of white zinfidel or reisling wine.  Waitress brings me a dry white wine.  I take it back to the bar and the bartender says we don't have Reisling or White Zinfidel... Strange why bring me what I didn't want.  My salad was hot.  Not going back"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE restaurant! Everything at B Spot is delicious and worth the price.   Burgers I've tried: Lola, Thin Lizzy, Fat Doug, and Reuben (a smasher special). They were all great. You must at Lola fries too. I'm addicted to the salt and light rosemary flavor. My favorite milkshake is the chocolate banana marshmallow, which is think and has roasted marshmallows on top.   I think what makes these burgers so amazing is the blend of meat that Chef Symon has created. One of a kind, just like Cleveland. Service is always quick and getting you on your way. This restaurant is not designed for a long meal.. and that's why I love it!  PS- I'm not a beer drinker, so no opinions here on that menu."}
{"text":"First time here, service is fast and friendly. They have a very nice selection of different types of burgers, and a variety of sides and milkshakes. I ordered the funguy burger clever name since it had grilled mushrooms on it  It was really good, not very filling though. My friend got the Fat Doug burger which had pastrami on it and it looked delicious, he said it was good and filling. I'll probably get that next time. All in all it was a good experience and about average pricing."}
{"text":"For all the hype about being a great burger, it wasn't even in the race for best burger. The burger was tasteless with no flavor and the bun fell apart.   Service was horrible and I waited about 15 minutes before a server showed up and another twenty for a bad burger.   Expected more out of Michael Symon."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and was told the wait would be 2 hours. I waited at the bar, had a beer and some chips and before I knew it, an hour later I was being seated.   The burgers were pretty darn good. I had the Yo! burger which was delicious. Next time I plan to have something a little more traditional because in the end I'm a purist and a good burger doesn't need all that stuff.   Oh! I almost forgot, Old Speckled Hen on tap!!"}
{"text":"Had a large group in for lunch today.  The food is creative and very good.  The staff is friendly, good quick service and it is clean. A little pricey, but most of these new chic burger joints are.  Recommend if you have not been to before."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is an Evil Genius. The fact that I can get a Milkshake with Bacon AND Bourbon in it is pure, pure evil - but SO GOOD at the same time.  I can't quit you, Iron Mike!"}
{"text":"The BAD:  -Ridiculously overpriced burgers that don't include fries.  So a basic hamburger with fries begins at $12.00.  Such a scam and rip off.   -Lola Fries- two visits in a row where there isn't any Rosemary on the fries.  It's supposed to be there and it's a trademark of the fries.    The Good:  - Excellent Happy Hour 3-6 M-F.  This is the only time I will go there for now on.  -Great beer selection.  -The hamburger meat tastes pretty good.    Overall-  It's only a place to go for Happy Hour.  Other than that ...go somewhere else ......  It's high priced for junk food.  Too bad.   Mr Simon....please lower your prices in Ohio. We aren't living in Northern Virginia (DC) or NYC."}
{"text":"The first stop after my parents pick me up from the airport to visit them, we make a  B line to the B spot. The burgers are excellent and the shakes are out of this world.  My favorite shake is the the chocolate marshmallow with a shot of dark rum.  Its thick, rich, decadent and the rum gives it the right balance that cuts through the fat of this tasty delight.  During your visit, don't forget the pickle bar. It offers lip puckering accompaniments for sandwiches.  For casual dining and a burger to satisfy your spot, this is the one baby!"}
{"text":"Service, menu, absolutely excellent. However, twice in a row my medium well burger is more like medium rare. Originally I thought they hand made all their burgers, not so, or it seems mine were of the mass produced factory variety. I'll double check next visit and correct this if I'm wrong."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had!  We were in Beachwood Ohio one Saturday afternoon and decided to hop over to nearby Woodmere, Ohio to check out B Spot.  I had the New Jack City burger which comes with chorizo sausage, avocado, salsa verde, roasted red peppers, red onion and pepperjack cheese. It was simply spectacular! My wife had the Fat Doug burger which comes with coleslaw, pastrami, Swiss cheese and mustard. She loved hers also. Our daughter had the Bacon Cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon and your choice of cheese. She loved hers as well. We eventually each passed our burgers around to get a bite of the different burgers and to sample what each other got. The quality of not only the meat but, also the ingredients in the burgers make them worth the $9.00 price tag. There is a free pepper and olive bar in the middle out the room to add some zing to your meal if you so desire.  We also got a order of chili cheese fries which are a la carte but were big enough for the three of us to share. For drinks my wife and I got Arnold Palmers (1/2 tea and 1/2 lemonade) and our daughter got pop. FYI, they charge for refills on the teas at least.  Our server Kelly S was very good as she took good care of us. This location is in a small upscale shopping mall so if there is a wait you can window shop while you wait.   P.S. make sure you know the below Symon Says before you visit:    Symon Says...    1. Welcome to B Spot! Help us help you!  2. No Whining! We will do our very best to make everyone happy. Just like line jumpers at an amusement park, whiners will be prosecuted & removed from the establishment. Life is short, have fun & enjoy the moment.  3. Due to the fact that we do not take reservations.... we need your cooperation and patience. We already assume that you know Michael, Liz, Doug, the Mayor, President Obama, etc... We will seat everyone in the order in which they arrive & only seat complete parties. We will do our very best to quote wait times correctly. Occasionally we may be a little off. Please refer to rule #2 if you are feeling any strange urges.  4. All food will come to the table together. This way we'll keep everything running ship shape & keep waits to a minimum. If you're interested in courses...ask your caddie.  5. We have a burger for every taste (even vegetarians)!! If there is something you do NOT want on your burger, let us know and we will take it off. Due to the many choices & thought put into their composition, we ask that you do not substitute or add items.  6. How our temperatures work...  Rare: blood red, cold/cool in center  Mid Rare: reddish, cool in the center  Medium: reddish/pink, warm center  Mid Well: barely pink, warm center  Well: no pink, very sad, hot center  7. If you're reading these, making funny faces & squinching your nose...you're too uptight! You should immediately consume bourbon, beer or your beverage of choice & relax a little!  Much Love, Michael"}
{"text":"So sad.  This place has gone down hill.  From service to quality of food everything is just \"ok\". The one good thing they have going is they still have Tony Packos Pickles!"}
{"text":"Waiting 40 minutes for 3 overpriced burgers. Not the service Michael Symon  intended. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"A very cool place. Good burgers, great fries.  The variety of burgers is nice."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I always enjoy my burger. I love the unique burger choices that they offer and the pickle bar is yummy. I also ordered their milkshake and it is enough to share with someone because you get so much. The restaurant was clean, service was great and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"I was expecting much more from an iron chef. Don't get me wrong, this place wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, it just wasn't that memorable. I am from the SF Bay Area and the burger place Barney's crushes the B Spot. The burgers were pricey for the smallish size of them. I was still hungry after finishing my burger and a quarter of my girlfriends. When you are paying $9 for a burger, you should at least get close to being full. You should go here once because of the whole Michael Symon iron chef thing, but that's enough for at least 8 or 9 months for us."}
{"text":"Yum. I love Micheal Symons food and all he does for Cleveland. Gourmet burgers without the grease!"}
{"text":"The atomic burger medium well is awesome. Great selection of IPA's. all in all a great spot for burgers and beer   2nd visit hoping for the same experience as my 1st visit.  Unfortunately, poor service. I pulled up my laptop hoping to enjoy drinks while I finish up some work.  I ordered my first beer and food and my check immediately followed my food.  No need for me to visit this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"We where driving back to Cleveland to drop off my son and needed to make a Target run. Realize B Spot was in the shopping center I spotted B spot on Friday but had to get home before the rush hour in Dayton.  I wanted to try a Michael Symon for the first time since it was a special treat. Since in 2 weeks it will be our last time  traveling to Cleveland when we pick my son from College. We order the milkshake special was the cookies n cream we spilt it 3 ways. The first milkshake we got was to runny but they made a fresh one for us that was much thicker it was very tasty. My son order a build your own burger he said it was very good.  My husband got the Yo it was a B Spot favorite same as mine the porky we spilt the fries it was shaken with rosemary it was yummy. If we ever come back to Cleveland for vacation we might stop again."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to love B Spot and would come frequently.  We loved the burgers and fries and ESPECIALLY loved the amazing Sriracha wings.  They were amazing- some of the best wings I've ever had.  The Happy Hour was amazing as well.  Burgers for $3 and brats for $2?  Perhaps too amazing because they last time we went on Monday, the Happy Hour is switched to $2 sliders with no option or brats.  And they took off the wings from the menu.  The manager said that they were not sustainably farmed.  Michael Symon (and don't get me wrong, I love the guy) tweeted that they didn't sell well enough.  And then to top it off, both she and I had massive diarrhea when we got home.  That means that we had food poisoning from some cross contamination in the restaurant, from this physicians perspective.  It was really disappointing- I would have given 5 stars before.  Now 3.  I'll take my time before going back."}
{"text":"This is a fun stop for lunch, particularly on a nice day when the garage door is up.  It's nice to get a breeze in the restaurant when you are enjoying a cold beer.  The burgers are good, although our orders have been screwed up just about every time we have been there.  And for not making substitutions, it seems as though we have had one every time.  The rule about not being seated until your whole party is there is really kinda silly.  I walked in with my 14 month old in my arms and was given a really hard time about getting a table even though the restaurant was half empty.  Silly power trips aside, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for a table but it was a Saturday night at 8 pm. Our server, Brandon, was awesome, explained all the menu items, gave suggestions, and was super speedy!   Atmosphere is nice, food is good, price is right! We had chili cheese fries (a little salty but generous portion), the Thin Lizzy burger, the Lola burger, a plain vanilla shake, and a loaded (bourbon) vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake. We had leftovers to go home and almost needed to be rolled out the door.  We'd definitely head back again!"}
{"text":"My son brought home the BSpot veggie burger and I have been craving another one ever since. Their fries have some rosemary in with the other seasonings and herbs - excellent! Saw a photo of their onion rings - can't wait to taste those ! Finally - my son had a chocolate shake - let me have a few sips - WOW! Excellent. I don't know about the rest of Mr. Symon's menu - but so far, SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Two words....BACON MILKSHAKE!!!!! lol sounds like it would be gross but it was amazing!   Perfect comfort food when you just don't care about calorie intake lol! Haven't had anything on the menu I don't like."}
{"text":"Great burgers!    I ended up having a burger here just before I flew out of Cleveland.  The setup is nice, with stacks of beer cans and a veggie burger simply called \"WHY?\"  The burger itself is good, and overall it's a nice place to grab some grub."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants!! The first time I went I ordered a regular cheese burger and it was delicious! Someone asked me \"what were you thinking? Next time you go do something different.\" So I decided to try the Lola Burger...WOW amazing!!!! Usually not my style but my taste buds were thanking me! The burger consists of fried egg, bacon, pickled red onions, cheddar and mayo...it melts in your mouth.   The burgers do not come with fries but you can split one order between 2-3 people.  I also recommend trying one of their shakes. You easily split these with 3 people. They sound different but are tasty! I have tried the chocolate banana marshmallow...safe and good for a first timer. The other Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon...I am a firm believer bacon makes everything taste better :)   Atmosphere- they have a wall of beer cans with red beer cans in the middle making the letter B...it's trendy and fun. The one in chagrin is a small location. This place gets packed quick so I recommend getting there early or don't complain if you have to wait for an hour...it's one of the rules.  You will see what I mean when you try it out!  Note: They do take reservations-first come first serve"}
{"text":"I know this is a burger joint. I'm not taking anything away from the masterpieces they serve. But the spotlight are the milkshakes. I had a chocolate covered peanut butter pretzel milkshake and I felt like I needed to smoke a cigarette afterwards :) The shakes are rather huge so sharing wouldn't be a bad idea. Check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here for the happy hour. Where else can you get a burger//brat, Lola fries and a few great draft beers for ~$15? When I can get a Head Hunter or Bam Bier for 3 bucks I'm good. Problem is, I do not like the food enough to come with regular pricing. Another minus is the draft selection doesn't change much. Still best happy hour going."}
{"text":"The burgers are bland, the fries are terrible. Everything is overpriced, and the staff lack knowledge or desire to provide even remotely decent service."}
{"text":"We came specifically for the impossible burger and were blown away! It's a vegan burger (well, I had cheese on mine because let's be real, cheeseburgers are too good) made to mimic the texture, taste, smell, and look of real meat. Amazing! Tasted delicious and exactly like meat. Definitely a unique experience! The rosemary fries were great too, with a more robust flavor than typical fries. Even the house-made condiments were really good. Very impressive, but I expected as much from such a great chef."}
{"text":"Horrible service, messed up multiple times on our order. Took 50 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"The lady and I popped into B Spot last night to grab a bite to eat. We had originally tried The Rail, but the wait was over an hour. I think it was divine intervention because this happened to be one of the best meals I've had at B Spot. Build Your Own Burger and definitely order the Lola fries. Make sure to use the Sasha sauce if you want a tangy, little spicy kick to your burger. The Lola Ketchup is to die for and I would buy it bottled if that was an option. Draft list is confusing but extensive. My girlfriend got a beer that was exclusive to B Spot and she loved it. Great spot for a date night, although not necessarily a money saver. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazeballs.  I've been to just about every burger hotspot in my hometown of NYC, and B Spot tops them all.  While I was a bit off-put when I saw that Symon's burgers were a Pat LaFrieda mix -- and not something local to Cleveland (just about every NYC burger joint uses LaFrieda; a NYC original) -- the final product was just sensational.  Throw in a a fantastic beer list, and the best onion rings I've ever had and I'm 100% sold.  I'd go back 100 times.    I had the Hot Doug burger."}
{"text":"Not your average burger joint, but luckily not the fancy schmancy type places that seem to be going up everywhere either.   The B Spot is just burgers done good.   Things I enjoy about it are; The smaller menu- I hate to be overwhelmed The fries- so skinny and yet so good The coffee bbq sauce- I have no idea how to describe it, but it is delectable The salads- simple and good and a nice addition to a burger joint The think I wasn't so crazy about was the beer prices and the overall cost.  Since everything is a la cart, it can get a little pricey if you want anything with your burger.  For example a side of fries are $4.   All in all, I will come again."}
{"text":"Burger joint. The burgers are good, not great but are actually cooked to the temperature ordered. One highlight is the pickled bar with all sorts of toppings available for the burger.  The location is great after shopping, but I do not think that I would go out of my way to get the burger from B spot. I had higher expectations of a Symon owned restaurant."}
{"text":"B spot was by far the best burger place I have ever been too.  Not that long of a wait only about 45 mins ( on a Saturday night not bad).  I had the Yo! burger and it was fantastic, cooked the way I wanted, they didn't over do it.  Also, I highly suggest getting a milkshake, I had the chocolate marshmallow banana with rum.  I honestly can not wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I used to think B Spot was a great place, but after further review.  I don't know anymore,  the last 2 burgers I got at the restaurant were completely different.  The Yo! burger and the fat dog burger, but they both seemed and tasted the same...Very greasy... I don't know, not sure if I will go back there.   Think the beer selection is terrible.  So all and all, doubt I will go back here."}
{"text":"Grissle in a burger is not cool.they suck.could not even believe. Better meat at steak and shake."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal at B Spot in the books! We have to give a huge shout out to our server Max. He was absolutely incredible from start to finish. I love a waiter who takes his time making sure to get our correct. I also LOVE a waiter who is enthusiastic about the menu and food. max has all of those qualities and I will be ask g to sit in his section again! He talked to us about monthly specials, talked bar selections with my husband and was just genuinely friendly and funny! He's a keeper!   Our burgers were the best we have had in ages. I mean B Spot is always good; but these were exceptionally well cooked. We all had a lovely time and will def be back ( as usual! )"}
{"text":"Hey mike me again - thanks for the vegetarian options at the burger joint. The grilled cheese + pickle bar + fries = meatless & delicious."}
{"text":"B spot is a great place to go if you want a really good burger. My husband and I have been to B Spot about 6 times in the last few weeks. Now our reasoning is mostly unrelated to the food, we are Kentucky fans and found that every time we ate there throughout the NCAA tournament, we won. It is definitley not a sports bar atmosphere but B Spot burgers and Mary the bartender were our good luck charm! The service at the bar is fantastic (a 5/5).   We have tried most things on the menu, all of the burgers are great with the porky being my husband's favorite. Always ask for the Smasher's special as it is usually something really interesting! I would steer clear of their turkey burger, it isnt bad, there are just way too many other options that are better. We happened to be there a lot during lent this year and were really impressed with the fish sandwich! I wish it could stay on the menu all year! They have a pretty good beer selection and a lot of different boubons which is great for us Kentuckians. The only negative I have is that they are a little overpriced for burgers, expect to spend about $50 for two people if you both order a sandwich, fries and craft beer."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE B Spot! It's one of my favorite places to go- from the pickle bar to the shakes to THE BURGERS! I love it!  This visit was our family trip out for my brothers birthday! Everything was normal, we got seated but then we didn't have a server for about 15 mins- no drinks...anything. Granted We did come in and say we were a group of 5 and the 5th would be joining us....once the 5th person got there she still waited 10 of those 15 with us. I had to ask the girl who sat us and it still took a few minutes for our server to get to us. The server also wasn't the best BUT that's the only time this has ever happened to me there- must have been an off night (but it was at 1PM).  Oh well, that doesn't take away from me giving BSPOT 5/5! The food is ON POINT! Love the Lola fries and a milkshake! Perfect day!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before but came today with a friend for drinks and a small bite to eat. We were truly in the mood for an appetizer but ended up getting a light snack instead. We walked in and the hostess was clearly taking a to go order. We stood for at least 8 minutes waiting for her to finish while watching many employees socializing. The place was practically empty. Our server was decent. She was nice and constantly checked on us. She wasn't a great server but not the worst.  To top it off a young teenager was walking around in inappropriate clothing near the food area. I didn't come in to see a young girl who clearly works here showing too much skin. Overall this restaurant was just okay. The food was pretty good, I was pleased with my beer and our server took care of us. Maybe another time will be better."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to B Spot for quite a while but was put off by the report that all food must be delivered at one time, we like to enjoy our nights out but finally went for dinner last night.  Being a Monday there was no wait so that was fine.  Ordered the Lola burger and must say that it was terrific!  Good draft beer selection, nice to see a little bit of everything.  Service was prompt too.  The only thing I can complain about was the lola fries, they were just ok, not real hot so I wasn't impressed.  Did taste onion rings ordered by another at our table and those were good so I would get them as my side next time."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and overall the food was good.   The burgers in my opinion weren't very impressive. I get mine cooked medium rare and they do come out at that temperature. But even at medium rare they are a little dry (Maybe the chef smashes them down during the cooking process).  The Lola fries are essential even though they aren't quite as good as fries from Lola's downtown which we eat at on occasion. They always seems a little more on the salty side relatively. Anyhow, they are still delicious.  My favorite thing at B-Spot has to be the hard (alcohol to be specific) milkshakes. I've tried many different kinds and they are all pretty good. The only drawback is the one with bacon can be a little hard to finish because the bacon is salty and it becomes undesirable.   Overall, I would recommend visiting here at least once if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious!  And probably one of the few places I would get a burger medium-rare (I love Ohio)... which, they aren't joking about the rare part.  I love all the pickled toppings and the selection of not less than 6 sauces - one of my favorites being the Lola ketchup, which happens to go terrifically with Lola fries (rosemary seasoning).  I also think their 'special' burgers (such as the Porky that contains a burger and pulled pork and Coleslaw) are pretty amazing.  I happened to get their seasonal pumpkin pie shake, that I asked if they would make less sweet, and it turned out huge and tasty - and truly made out of pumpkin pie with vanilla ice cream.  Service was also great, etc.  I do remember coming the first time a few years ago and being blown away as well - although the burgers are huge and I can barely fit it in my mouth.  This is more your modern, loaded burger, with distinct flavors and toppings, so you don't want to come in expecting your traditional burger and a side of fries and price... But hey, you get a bang for your buck.  Thank you, Michael Symon.  This is similar to another upscale, burger joint (Flipside) in Hudson that I happen to love.  Flipside burgers are packed with flavors as well and offers well thought out, balanced, high quality burgers.  Bspot feels more casual and has a unique signature, so you win either way!"}
{"text":"I love Lola's.  I love Lolita's.  I do not love The B Spot, and that admission is so painful it has to be hauled out of me by steel hooks.   For those of you who don't get the connection, all those three restaurants are owned by local Iron Chef Michael Symon, and two of them are golden. Lola's and Lolita's are as good as it gets in Cleveland.  So when Michael said, \"I want to put the same care and attention to detail into casual, dining food\" and opened up a burger joint, I couldn't wait to go.    At first, everything looks good - a little snooty, but fine.  The burgers are made the way Michael wants them, which means you can't add ingredients, only take them off.  And there is a list of several rules you must follow when you're here: fine, fine, as long as I get the tasty burgers.   Except they weren't tasty.    They were really dry, hardly tasting of beef at all.  Mine was slightly moister than my friends, until I realized that having a burger with an egg on top of it was imparting a moistness that other burgers didn't have.  There were, admittedly, a bunch of tangy (and tasty!) sauces that you could put onto your burger to improve the flavor, but the underlying taste was still leathery.    The shakes were, well, shakes - I had the apple-bacon milkshake, which wasn't bad (the little flecks of bacon didn't particularly improve or detract from the apple flavor), but it wasn't anything I couldn't get straight from Mitchell's.    The Lola fries were, as always, amazing.  But I can go to Lola for that.  And should.    Is it a bad place?  No, not really - except that on a weekend, you're going to wait for an hour to two hours to get into this hot spot, AND pay about $2 over the cost of a normal sit-down burger to have this.  Is all that cost, expense, and rule-finding worth it?  Heck no.    Like Fox Mulder, I wanted to believe.  But in the end, I felt like I was filling out my taxes: a lot of rules, a lot of waiting, and all for not much of a payoff.  Disappointing.    (P.S. - Could just be that I caught them at the wrong time, but the bathroom was also festooned with toilet paper.  Not appetizing.)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday. Quite good. Burgers were perfectly medium rare. The pickle bar was interesting. Would have like the fries a little better, but felt they were lacking something. They're Rosemary infused but seriously didn't get a lot of that at all. A bit pricey for sides, I felt. Also the wait staff needs to step it up.  I got coffee and the bf got a Pepsi. He had to ask for a refill. I never got one. Frankly, that's a big no no in my world.  Overall, because of the burger I will go again, but I will certainly not expect much more than that. The four stars are for the food. Not the service."}
{"text":"Amazing menu; horrible execution.  After everyone at the table ordering anything under \"Mid-Well\" doneness getting a lecture with what those doneness levels typically mean, all of our med-rare burgers came out, you guessed it: medium-well to well.  Had our group not had to beg for drink refills and had time to have our burgers remade the way we ordered them, I think we would've had an amazing experience; what a shame!  Clearly the execution at this Michael Symon needs some work."}
{"text":"This is a great burger spot especially if you're in the mood for a shake to accompany it!  Their burgers are definitely quality and you can certainly taste a difference from lower quality burgers.  They have a number of burger combination on their menu but if you want you are able to customize your own!  They have a number of cheeses that you would usually think to put on burgers but actually end up being super delicious!   The pickle bar is definitely a major highlight of the restaurant.  So fun to sample a bunch of different artisan pickles before your meal comes or to add on top of a burger!  Their milkshakes are delicious and so delicious that they are a must get if you are hungry enough!  They're great to split with someone else because they are massive and filled with lots of toppings and some even come with alcoholic additions!  Their food can definitely be on the pricier side for just a burger and you have to order any sides like fries or onion rings separately.  So if you're looking for something more affordable I'd probably try someplace else!"}
{"text":"The coolest thing about this place is the soaring tower of old beer cans that spells a big B.  Beyond that, don't expect a fantastic experience.  The burger choices are certainly varied, but also not unique.  One comes with bacon, another comes with bleu cheese, and so on.  Their snotty \"house rules\" are left on each table, directing patrons (among other things) not to make substitutes.  Oh, I'm sorry, I was just trying to get creative because your menu isn't.  Note to vegetarians/vegans:  Head elsewhere.  This is, after all, a burger joint.  The meatless options are nearly non-existant."}
{"text":"First time here ... and there's some good food here; pulled pork, bratwurst, burgers, etc. I had the 'Porky Brat' (Bratwurst, pulled pork w/vinegar based NC BBQ sauce, and cheddar cheese) and their 'Porky Fries' (fries with pulled pork, cheese, and jalapeños). It was VERY good!!! Highly recommend if in the mood for casual sports bar & grill type dining."}
{"text":"Oh B Spot, what happened? You were so amazing on our first date, but like so many others you turned out to be a disappointment.  Went to B Spot for the third time this evening and everything was bland. Boyfriend ordered the award-winning Fat Doug and while it wasn't the worst item we had, this was definitely no award winner. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, remembering the wonderful flavor of the pulled pork that topped my boyfriend's burger on our first visit. Apparently the recipe has changed because this pulled pork was as flavorless as a Bud Light. I sent it back and asked for my old favorite the Chick Magnet instead.  Also flavorless.  Did someone suck all of the flavor out of B Spot?  Our one saving grace was the Chopped Salad which wad topped with ham, salami, and provolone. I can't give the chefs any credit here...those ingredients don't need any special flair. Oh, and the St. Louis Frambois was also good.  Dear B Spot, we're done. As much as I wish I could say \"It's not you, it's me\"...that would be a lie. It's you. You've changed. And I just can't be with you anymore."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars here and always enjoy the burgers and lola fries. Highly recommend for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Terrible service. Actually the wait staff is always nice but the wait times are always atrocious. Not waiting for a table which we rarely have do but the food coming from the kitchen takes forever even during the no slow times. They are always under staffed somehow."}
{"text":"The burgers are decent...nothing special.  Waaaaay overpriced, especially for a lonely burger.  Where are the fries, chips, something?!?  $10 for a burger with no side dish is ridiculous.  Pickle bar is a nice touch, but definitely doesn't make up for what they lack."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3. B spot has some great outdoor picnic-table type seats in the front to people watch at Crocker Park.  Has a fun pickle/condiment bar.  It also has some random quips and stuff around the place, but largely immemorable other than that.  Cost: 2. Slightly overpriced by Cleveland standards when you factor in portion size.  Although Michael can do it because of his rep, it unfortunately puts a number of other Cleveland burger joints ahead of his for me anyway (for me those include Southside, Buckeye Beer Engine, Taphouse, Swensons off the top of my head).  Food Quality: 4.  Despite prices, B Spot has solid, eclectic burgers here.  I've had several and all have been good -- be sure to ask about burger of the day, which is typically awesome but varies.  Avoid the pulled pork which was average at best.  Burgers are a la carte and a bit small as mentioned above, so put either lola fries, onion rings, or chips on the side.  Last note is that the wings flavors are great, but wings themselves are a little bit on the chewy/undercooked side which I'm not a fan of it, so ask for them crispy if your like me.  Service: 4. Pretty good generally, constant water refills from 16 year old's, friendly wait staff overall.  When to return: Moseying at Crocker Park.  People watch outside.  Happy hour (good beer selection).  Quick casual dinner that's not to go.  Pre/post shopping."}
{"text":"Terrible quality control in the kitchen. They served us a BLT without any lettuce, tomato, or mayonnaise -- just bacon and bread. The parmesan dip came out so watery as to be almost inedible. Would not recommend under any circumstances."}
{"text":"OK burgers, bad atmosphere and staff has no ability to deal with questions outside of the menu, like, how does a mushroom slapped inside a bun qualify as a veggie burger? Come on, Iron Chef...you can come up with a veggie burger that tastes good...When 5 out of 6 in party are carnivores but you lose the whole group b/c one has a different diet? And there's nothing for kids...(same philosophy.)"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  I was very excited to try this out for the first time, but I will not be going back.  I am a vegetarian, and I LOVE veggie burgers, so I was very excited to try their take on it.  I was extremely disappointed and annoyed to learn that they do not have a veggie burger.  they have a mushroom burger but..ew. no thanks. a nice burger joint that doesn't have veggie burgers? are you kidding? ridiculous! the service wasn't great and we were very slow to be seated.   i ended up getting the romaine salad with no chicken, and the dressing was so thick it wasn't dressing anymore. it was an extremely thick sauce.  it was impossible to lightly coat the salad at all without turning it into a stew with some lettuce in it. oh and, they would not reduce the price of my salad without the chicken.  so, i paid 11 dollars for lettuce stew.  even if they were to put a veggie burger on the menu, i would not return."}
{"text":"The Lola burger was amazing! The flavors were spectacular, I never though that a sunny side up egg would give a burger such a full flavor topped with pickled onions and cheese, it was cooked to perfection. What made the dinner complete was the fine poured Guinness. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place because I have heard that B spot's burger is the best in Cleveland. Considering their price (around $10 per dish), the food quality is fairly high and the dining environment is delightful.  I love their little side bar, where you could choose the pickles for your burger with no additional charge. The sweet & spicy(?) tastes wonderful!!!  I got the fat Doug burger, personally I don't like coleslaw to be that sour like fat Doug does. And you could hardly taste the pastrami. So it's only in a medium level. My friend had the Lola. It's always good to have a sunny side egg in your burger.  Fat tire amber ale was great. The service was kinda slow but acceptable. Overall it was a good experience. Forgot to mention, their \"call ahead to be added on seating list\" service is wonderful! And animal fries tastes like heaven!!!"}
{"text":"B Spot, I'm underwhelmed.  For a \"burger joint\" I get a better burger at my corner dive bar and it is a heck of a lot cheaper.  Das mann says I'm paying for \"overhead\" (that's restaurant speak) and quite frankly, I don't give a flying fig for \"overhead\".  I want good food for the $ I spend and I don't feel like I get it at B Spot.  B spot is a-la-cart dining.  You order a burger, you get a burger.  You order fries, you get fries.  Upon my last dining experience I ordered the \"Lola Burger\" which has fried egg and some other goodies on top.  It was mediocre at best.  Note:  Pet Peeve is when I'm asked how I'd like my meat prepared and it isn't cooked appropriately.  It isn't rocket science kids, you throw a meat thermometer in the meat and check the temp, should come out perfectly every time.  And for all the hype Michael Symon gets, I'm shocked that his kitchen's would send out a well-done burger when a medium one was requested.    The fries are \"shoe-string\" and if you request w/out rosemary they taste like nothing.    B Spot does offer a nice beer selection which does save this review a touch.  Honestly, if you want a decent burger, head over to the Oriole on Wed (Half-price burger night) and get a hand-made patty on a bun, a cheap draft & you'll walk out full and spending $10.  Sorry kids, but this is not the place to B!"}
{"text":"First review, but this needs to be said. Usually haven't had any problems but this time was different. Went with my family last week and we all ended up getting sick. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers but buyer beware, when it comes to the \"burger of the month\", they do not like to make any changes to the recipe. I got the December BBQ Burger w/ cheddar, smoked beef brisket, coffee bbq sauce, and pork crackling. All it was missing was a sunny side up egg ( in my opinion).  After the manager came to the table and explain to me that they do not make any changes to the burger of the month, she met me half way and brought the fried egg on the side for me to add.  The only thing it was missing was pickled red onion that I could have got from the condiment bar."}
{"text":"This review is going to sound odd I'm sure - because the food was good but the service was where most of the visit tanked.  Hubbs ordered a Vanilla Apple Pie Bacon milkshake with bourbon -  but asked nicely if they could add the bourbon AFTER they brought it to the table and we split it so I could have some (I'm Preggo with twins) - most folks in this situation would expect an of course after I don't know maybe a stare at the moon that is my stomach - instead the waiters response was \"ooohhh they don't like to do that I will have to clear it with my manager\"...really?   Um ok so save the $5 up charge for the bourbon and we will just do the plain shake...I mean that's the alternative - I'm suddenly not going to be not pregnant and ready for bourbon lol. Anyhoo we ordered at this point - me a YO! & the hubbers a Porky with Fries no Rosemary.  So we wait...and we wait...the waiter emerges to say that the milkshake is still being worked on and he will let us know what the decision is.   Then he comes back out when our food comes out to say he's been cut and introduce his replacement - as he's talking one of the cams ornaments tied to the antlers above our table fall and smack my husband IN THE HEAD - the response both servers and a fellow patron laugh, LAUGH, laugh...seriously?  W O W.  Shit falls from the sky that you set up and no responsibility is taken?   Oh milkshakes still not out yet - that finally came out when we have maybe half a burger left - to the managers credit she did apologize for that taking a ridiculous long time to master with the mind...and comped the milkshake - however by the time we paid and left no one had asked how my husbands skull was..."}
{"text":"Ugh. So disappointed. My mom was in town and always watches Michael Symon on The Chew so we took her here. I know I know should've done Lola or Mabel's but we live on East Side and it was a last minute thing.   The good: amazing Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake loaded with bourbon. Lola fries.   The super average: both my wife and my burgers were over cooked and dry.   The bad: We ordered onion rings from our server Michelle as an app. Never got em. Fine, meals came out quick enough and we had plenty of food. When check came though, I looked at bill and there was an extra drink we didn't order on there...worst part was before I said anything, she walked over and casually said \"oh there's probably an extra drink on there\"...so she knew and was going to try to get away with it? Also my wife ordered a beer and she had a different beer that was $1 more on original check.  Maybe an honest mistake(s) but based on her reaction, doubt it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We've been going here since the day it opened and gradually each experience has gotten worse. Today my burger, the Atomic was supposed to be hot, nope fail in that and it tasted frozen and not a quality burger. Then wife's salad was not green at all but a pale shade of yellow. Not sure we will continue going back to witness the demise of B Spot."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  If you love hamburgers it is worth the stop.  You shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Although my party of 6 enjoyed our burgers and sides, the rules (see the \"Symon Says\" list by the host/hostess stand) really turned me off from this place. Given its location, lack of competition, and general fare, it's too bad that the owner(s) are taking the fun out of the B Spot. Loosen up people, it's only burgers!!!"}
{"text":"I have had good meals and bad meals. Its a toss up. The kitchen staff RIPS. The waiting staff is a little strange. Seems like they might be on space dust. I choose brats over burgers usually. Wings are cool. Porky Fries are good if you don't plan on eating anything else the rest of the day. AND you have to try the apple pie bacon shake. Make me wanna get down on the dance floor."}
{"text":"I feel the need to throw my 2 cents in about this place. The burgers are great. I got the \"yo\" burger and it was pretty good. Onion rings were pretty good too. Service, good, considering that it was jam packed. It took forever to get refills though. The waitress must have walked by 3 times before I got one.   I've been here twice and the place was completely slammed both times.  But the food came out at a reasonable time. If you are meeting people there, make sure that you are all together at the venue because they wont seat you otherwise. You pay for the iron chef, not the burgers. There are weird rules on the wall too. Like \"No substitutions\" so I can take off the grilled onions, but I cant add raw onions? Whats up with that? And \"No Whining?\" I understand that customers can be a little overbearing, but, as a customer, I think I have the right to whine if I have a reason to whine. I shouldn't go into a restaurant and be afraid to complain."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich and the porky fries. Nice atmosphere when the weather is nice and the front doors are open to the patio."}
{"text":"Went twice this week, service at the bar and in the restaurant were both outstanding, I forget the bartender's name but my server was Ryan and he was on point, suggestions and attentiveness. Sit at the bar, they give complimentary pork rinds. They go really well with the selection of house made sauces. Free pickle bar!!! Onion rings and fries were perfect and don't be afraid to order the bologna, it's almost an inch thick!"}
{"text":"First timer, really enjoyed the burgers.  Had the Thin Lizzy medium, and it was just right.  Very tasty.  Place was packed, server (Jerrod?) was friendly and prompt, burgers took a little while but understandably so.  Price is not cheap for a burger, but not crazy either.  Think mine was $8.99.  Fries were just ok to me.  I like a thicker fry, these are thin, but they were not overly greasy. Lemonade was very tasty.  Good beer list.  The pickle bar is different... basically different types of sliced pickles you can help yourself too... garlic, jalapeno, Tony Packo type,etc.  Nice variety of sauces to try (other than just regular catsup or mustard).  I'd go again and try something different."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger but didn't blow my mind, especially for the premium price. I did really enjoy the pickle bar however.  I haven't found myself really wanting to go back here."}
{"text":"Surprised. I've heard so much about these places and I was really confused... I thought at first, \"maybe I'm in the wrong place?\". The service was just ok, and the burger was sub-par. They had a relish bar with different types of pickled enmities such as pickled peppers, pickled tomatoes, your standard fare pickles, etc. Interesting idea but seemed lazy in the presentation/execution. After it all, It still really didn't add much flavor to the boring burger. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fun Guy for takeout (and subbed turkey) and it was ridiculous.  I sort of wish I would've ordered two.  I LOVE me some mushrooms and there was no shortage of them on this burger.  They were so full of umami, which is probably attributed to being cooked in butter, but whatever.  It was also topped with lots o blue cheese and grilled onions.  The patty wasn't dry and it was decent size.  A lot of times turkey burgers are dry, small and bland.  But of course the Iron Chef does not play around.  The bun held up well with all the toppings and the large patty.  I'm here for work and might just have to come back here tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy good bars and burgers.  I really have been looking for a spot to have a high quality burger, and down a selection of Belgian ales.  While B Spot's selection of beer cannot truly rival any true, dyed-in-the-wool beer haven, it's got a decent selection.  Like any other gastro-pub, the wait-staff are dressed in black.  Service was reasonably prompt, and the decor tastefully understated.  One facet I really enjoyed was the pickle-bar.  The selection of various pickles, all with different flavours and textures was a welcome surprise.  Now, all we need is a ketchup bar.  Mustard choices were also in multiples.  The burgers were good.  I can't say that they were superlative -- but they were solid burgers for the price.  The burgers will definitely want another go, and I'll probably be back sooner rather than later.    My favourite part of the menu:  Veggie burger. \"Why?!\" And they offer to add bacon for free.  Classic."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had at the B Spot in Strongsville. We called ahead with a large group of 8. When we arrived there was an hour- hour and a half wait but thanks to the call ahead an yelp waitlist we only had a half hour wait. Erica rocked getting everyone seated quickly and even sent us apps for the wait. She was definitely running the show there last night! The food and shakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely stunned that this place still exists.  I can't imagine how or why anyone would give this burger joint anything more than 3 stars.  To start, I don't mind paying money for good food, but Bspot is a joke.    I had ordered the French onion burger.  It was tasteless.  The only favorable thing I can say about this burger is that it's temp was spot on.  How can a burger with gruyere cheese and carmelized onions be tasteless?  As I was sitting there eating my $9 burger and sipping on my $3 soda, I was actually thinking about Wendy's.  I haven't been to Wendy's in 10 or more years.  I probably won't eat there either, but the moment I took a bite of that burger...I was contemplating getting up, walking out and supporting a fast food chain.  The worst part of this meal was the fries.  If you go to this place and you are fighting with whether or not you want to pay $4 for fries (nothing comes with your $9 burger...not even homemade chips) ...I highly suggest not going for the fries.  They were such a let down.  Once again, McDonald's or Wendy's fries are better.  Also, the fries came out cold.  Who wants cold fries?  For $4, one would think that you are getting a fantastic and original tasting cup of fries.   Definitely NOT THE CASE!  This place was such a let down that I actually had to get online, immediately, to write a review and save others from making the mistake I had made.  I have not been on yelp for a long time.  This place made me do it.    Michael Symon, what happened?  I thought you were a professional.  I would make the trip to Pittsburgh, PA and go to Burgatory before I would ever return to Bspot.  Burgatory is less expensive and 100% superior.  I truly feel like this place was an ego-driven venture and nothing more.    I walked out of this horrible restaurant $25 poorer and more dissatisfied than I have been in a long time."}
{"text":"The burgers are consistently done to perfection. The rosemary fries are superb. (I am not a fri lover and usually don't eat them when they come with my meal) I actually make a trip to the B Spot because I crave their fries! Servers are always friendly. My only complaint is that food is served in a basket instead of on a plate. No room for the great sauces and pickles! When I remember to ask for a plate when ordering it is always provided."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here! The burgers are the perfect portion size. Although their burgers do not come with fries, ordering a side of fries won't break the bank. However, you can visit their \"pickle barn\"to add a variety of pickle fixings to your burger. I like to get the kimchi, garlic dill pickles, and the sweet and spicy pickles with my burger. My go-to meal is the gobbler burger with the Lola fries. Also when you're here, don't reach for the ketchup because they have so many other condiments that are their own original condiments. I recommend dipping fries in Sasha sauce which is a bit spicy. A milder favorite of mine is the coffee barbecue sauce.    So I'm giving the b-spot 4 stars because quite frankly yes I would like my burger to come with fries. Also the service can be a little slow, especially today when I was trying to pay. It took the waitress 15 mins to pick up my payment. She only came because I told someone to get her. I honestly think she forgot about me and my friend. BUT as a whole, I usually have good experiences here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and burgers are excellent! Love the pickle bar and fries are one of the best around!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's nice and casual, and the burgers really are tasty.  My favorite is the Lola with the fried egg on top.  Mmmmm... fried egg on a medium rare burger - yes please!    The fries are out of this world.  Perfectly crispy and then tender inside.  (Skinny fries usually turn me off because they are all crisp, no tender center.)  Rosemary and sea salt, and like others have said, good for two to share.  I totally look forward to those fries.  I've had the chips as well, which are served with a rosemary white sauce. Quite tasty, but not my favorite.    Also great-the onion rings.  Oh yes...crispy, tasty, yummy.  Onion rings can so quickly go icky the way some restaurants do them.    Something we learned this week:  happy hour is awesome. I had the Lola burger and a Milk Stout on draft, and my bill came to $8.64.  Now THAT is a happy hour!    And look at that... I've digressed to beer.  The menu has a nice selection of beers.  Quite a few typical are on there, but I was shocked and impressed at some of the more rare ones.  I went with the Milk Stout (boring and safe) because the one I wanted was only available in bottles, and it comes in a BIG bottle.    Parking at lunch time is impossible.  Good gravy, that shopping center is busy.  Dinner time, still quite busy, but parking was easily located without walking a mile.    We will go back for dinner.  That happy hour was nice.  :)"}
{"text":"I like this place, but hate the location..  OK...got that off my chest. Whew!  I am a sucker for a mediim.rare burger with an egg on top. And Michael Symon delivers every time. I get the burger perfectly cooked, and they don't try to counsel me to overcook it. In other words, they understand how it should be done.   The beer selection has a nice variety, and they do growlers.  The atmosphere is fun, and very casual. The paper towels on the table are a necessity.  Service is typically good, at least I've had no issues.   Love the pickled items bar.   Oh! And those rosemary fries! Perfect. No really...PERFECT. They are skinny fries that are perfectly cooked, and so magical. I can take or leave fries...let's face it...they are everywhere. I'm incapable of going here without having some of these tasty treats."}
{"text":"I was so happy to share my first B spot experience with my boyfriend! I enjoyed my experience here on a breezy weekday night. We ordered the Fat Doug and Yo! and shared it.   Mmmm.... and they were good. They hit the spot after a long day. These aren't just any burgers... they have fried salami on them! They have pastrami on top of quality beef? Delicious! They also have a sweet pepper / green tomatoes / other bar along with 6 delicious sauces to dip your burger in, like balsamic steak sauce, special ketchups and mustards. Yum!  Their beef is high quality too - worth the price.  We had a side of lola fries and I always enjoy the rosemary flavoring.  The service was really helpful and prompt. They directed us (first timers) to the award winning burgers, and they were good. I'd definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"First of all, our waitress stood at our table without saying a word and then just left because her monitor for putting in our order wasn't working. When she came back she finally introduced herself and her handheld still wasn't working. Our shakes sat out too long and she had to place the order again and we got our food before the shakes.   Food wasn't that great, nothing surprising, I expected more. I would've liked a bigger portion of a burger and at least have fries with the meal.  As we ate dinner we saw and heard 3 different waiters and the manager on duty go to different tables with the wrong food including ours with us eating our food! The night was a disaster. Horrible service, average food, will not be going back to this restaurant  again."}
{"text":"I am just now realizing I've never reviewed this spot! I began visiting here a few years ago since my husband is from Cleveland (and loves burgers.) My \"perfect burger\" is actually ON the menu as \"Thin Lizzy\" and I think it's so delicious. I love the atmosphere, the food, the brews...this place is just great!  My favorite has to be the Porky Fries. They are just so simple but indulgent! I suggest adding some spice from the pickle bar! You won't be disappointed in this modern, delicious burger joint."}
{"text":"Five stars for having the incredible Impossible Burger on the menu, and for cooking it so deliciously. It's so delicious, even my carnivore mom was really impressed. It's a shame your fried foods are off limits because they are cooked in lEd, but props for pointing that out right on the menu. And thanks for the free pickle bar too."}
{"text":"Went here for the impossible burger. Frankly I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. It did it was very satisfying.   Started off with an Old Rasputin stout. Excellent choice. I had the impossible burger and my guest got the porky burger which is a burger topped with pulled pork and coleslaw. Service was good and the food came quickly cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once with a friend and, most recently on my own for dinner.  This most recent visit, I ordered the thin lizzy, Lola Fries and a drink.  Since I sat at the bar, my order was put in pretty quickly, but since it was on the busier side, it took a good 20-30 minutes for my order to get out.  I could see the kitchen from where I was sitting and it seemed like they needed an extra runner and that there were spurts of food coming out.    Anyways, the Thin Lizzy was good, but kind of fell apart when I tried cutting it to eat it.  It was cooked the way I wanted it which is a plus.  Love the fries, I just wish they weren't as crispy as they were this time around!"}
{"text":"Good service, food is good but not great. The prices are a bit on the high side especially for the sides. If you want a great burger I would recommend going to \"The Rail\""}
{"text":"Went there as a family. My kids got their mini burgers off the kids menu (warning, their mini-burgers are really really small, my kids were still hungry, even with side dishes and drinks included). My wife and I decided to go for a chicken burger (build your own burger) - it was pretty good, nothing out of ordinary, but good. I love their pickled bar, I thinks its great. Had no time to try their shakes but from my previous experience, they are pretty good but can't speak on that on this visit."}
{"text":"The B Spot is located in Eton Collection on Chagrin Blvd.  Parking can be very difficult.  There are lots of businesses in the plaza and certainly no enough parking spaces!  We had lunch at B Spot today and everyone enjoyed their food.  I had the Lola Burger and two other people in our party had the Porky Burger and they were all delicious! We also had an order of the Lola fries.  They're \"skinny\" fries which aren't my favorite but they have a good flavor.  Milkshakes are also on the the specialties and we shared a vanilla bean milkshake and it was very good.  There is a pickle bar with five or six different flavors of pickles, pickled onion and banana peppers.  While the food was very good, the service was spotty.  It was a busy day but the food took forever to come out.  Also, one person in our party had two knives but no fork.  It took our server a very long time to bring us a fork after we asked.  I'm sure we will be back since the food was good but I hope the services is better next time."}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh and tasty and so are the fries. The atmosphere is cute and the pickle bar is pretty cool. (try the garlic pickles). I do wish parking wasn't such a pain in Crocker park. There are a few B Spots around Cleveland...I do want one further West!"}
{"text":"I have to commend whomever helped me over the phone last night. We were at the Q watching the Monsters hockey game. My 6 year old son (a very newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic) had eaten some Lola French fries from the Bspot there. The employees at the Q could not help us with the carb content of the Lola fries. Carb content is VERY important for someone dependent on insulin to live. We couldn't even find the information online!!   I called the Westlake location out of desperation and hope, and not only did the manager put me on hold to try and find out the carb information, but he took my phone number to call me back since he couldn't get the information I desperately needed. He called me back a few minutes later, after he talked with his bosses higher up!! I could not believe the time and energy this gentleman took to help someone on the phone that wasn't even eating at his location. I wish I could remember his name. If he reads this, please let me know your name!   Thank you from the bottom of my heart."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Bar with buddy yesterday and we both agree that this place is great!  I would have given 5 Stars, but it took 10 min's for the Bartender to notice us, she also had an attitude.  Anyways, my burger(thin lizzy), was excellent and the Lola fries were also good, but not near close to the best I've ever had.  Everyone I know thinks they are best fries in the world, I don't get it, just my 2 cents.    The place was packed, but the service was quick, and I can't wait to get back.  I think the prices are fine, there is nothing on the menu over $11.  Next time, I'm trying the wings and brats. They looked amazing as the servers wizzed by us.    The B-Spot is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Michael Symons establishments for quite some time, in particular Roast in Detroit.  When in Cleveland and not very hungry, DH surprised me by stopping at B Spot.  So sweet :)  I ordered the Lola burger which was delicious (I'm partial to fried eggs on my burgers) and hubby had some yummy contraption with Pastrami.  Both burgers had great flavor on their own, and we're cooked as ordered.  The onion rings are definitely ones you'll have to try!  I'd live to come back and try a different burer (plenty of options here!) and one of the crazy, but delicious sounding shakes."}
{"text":"When I travel to Westlake for work, I always have to make a trip to B Spot and grab a burger and fries. The fries, onion rings and milkshakes are so good here! The first time I came here they had a S'mores milkshake special, it's the best milk shake I've ever had. I wish it was a regular on their menu. I change up the burger I get every time I go there. Last time I was there, i got the turkey burger, which I didn't really like, but when I've gotten a regular burger I'm always very happy! Can't wait for my next trip to Westlake for work so I can stop by here!"}
{"text":"Good burger - trust the description.  We usually get medium rare but medium here is perfect.  We had onion rings which were fine but not my favorite.  Jarred, our waiter, did a great job.  Nice place to stop if you are in the area but not a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Save your money.  The burgers are inconsistently cooked with texture and flavor   poor in comparison with local completion.  The meat patty appears and tastes like it was frozen.  There are far better alternatives that serve fresh ground beef."}
{"text":"Waited more than an hour. Totally wasn't worth it. Without a doubt worst meal I've had this year. Extreme greasy burger. It smelled like it was cooked on a dirty grill. My burger smelled like it was grilled in bacon fat. Oil for fries hasn't been changed or cleaned in days. I can't wait to go home so I can throw up before I get sick. First and last time here. Took forever to get our check. Almost felt.like we were being held hostage."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I think this place may just be bit overrated :(  The few times I've been here, I've ordered the New Jack City and the Fat Doug. I'm usually a huge fan of chorizo and avocados, but the New Jack City just didn't do it for me. I definitely regret getting the Fat Doug because cole slaws and burgers don't quite go together in this case. The burgers were also fairly small.  I also got the chili cheese fries with scallions on top. Quite a large portion and worth the $7.   I do want to give B Spot another shot, so I'll try coming back during their happy hours!"}
{"text":"Not a huge burger person but I could easily find something i likes on B Spot's menu. I wish it was a bit more diverse. Also, you had to pay extra for fries. Great one time place to go but i don't see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for work and had heard about this restaurant. I ordered the \"Atomic Burger\" and it was super hot even for me a Caribbean woman accustomed to spicy food.  I ordered a milkshake which I'd not had since I was a teenager!! I ordered the special of the month which was a Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel milkshake. And it was super delicious and the major factor in my lips completely not falling off from the heat of the Atomic Burger! Lol!  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the burger menu was pretty vast. You can order a burger that is a staple on the menu or, you can create your own burger with various toppings of your choice.  They had a pickle bar which unfortunately I didn't get to explore, perhaps next time."}
{"text":"Simplest review ever: B Spot is a Michael Symon restaurant. Need I say more?   I've lived in New Orleans, an historic city that prides itself on its longstanding and innovative culinary prowess, and while not many restaurants can come close to being on par with the New Orleans food scene, no New Orleans chef could ever even dream of cooking something as titillating as one of Michael Symon's creations. The man is a genius.  Indeed, this is neither Lola nor Lolita. But for what it is, a hip, chic, and laid back burger and beer bar-grille, this place is amazing. There are many good beers -- and even better burgers. From the standard cheeseburger, to one of the nifty specialty burgers, you can count on B Spot to satiate your beef cravings. Make sure to finish your meal with a milkshake -- even the one with bacon it (should we expect anything less from Symon?) is delicious.  Grade: A+"}
{"text":"So happy that I loved this place. Was a little worried after reading the reviews here, but I had a great experience. The location does have one side open to the mall, but it also has a beautiful outdoor patio on the other side, so there's definitely options. The Lola fries were awesome, the burgers were good and the pickle bar was a cool added plus (I wouldn't say the burgers are to die for, but definitely good). Also shared an arugula salad that was great. The real winner of the night though was the marshmallow chocolate banana shake we shared, with toasted marshmallows on top, was so so good. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because our waitress wasn't friendly at all, and made it pretty clear she wasn't happy to be there, and made it seem like refilling our waters put her out. Otherwise, was a great experience."}
{"text":"This time I got the Lola Burger and wow, amazing. Not sure if the Lola or Red Hot burger is my favorite. The bf got the Clevelander which was very good but not one we will order again next time. The rosemary fries were great. I tried a couple of drinks but the Stormy Weather is still my favorite by far."}
{"text":"Came into Cleveland and the first thing we did was visit Michael Simons B Spot! Cleveland is getting know as quite the foodie spot thanks to locals such as Simon.   We arrived for lunch time but were quickly seated at the table with no problem. Our waiter greeted us, he was very friendly and helpful in answering any questions. They have a lot of local brews on tab to get your started!   I ordered the fat Doug, which Simon has won an award for. It has coleslaw, pastrami, Swiss cheese and of course Cleveland's famous stadium mustard. You can also order how you'd like the burger done and the menu states how 'pink' your selection will be.  The bun to the burger was also really fresh not your typical sesame seed bun you find in most burger joints. The fries are out of this world! Very thinly sliced with a Rosemary dust to it, they were delish! The order is quite large, so be sure to share with your table.   I think one thing that makes this place stand out that any other regular burger joint is they have a pickle bar! You heard right, a pickle bar! Take your burger up and pile on all the pickles you want, with a large selection of different pickles. Way to represent Cleveland, keep rockin' on Simon!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  Fun place to eat and I love the flavor combinations on the different burgers."}
{"text":"Not only does B Spot have amazing food, it has superior service. We had a large party and they were able to accommodate us easily and effectively.   I have never had such quick and thoughtful service. They made it possible for my group to get in and out in under an hour. I would highly recommend going there and tipping well because they are worth it!"}
{"text":"Flew to Cleveland Ohio for business trip and was looking for nice burger place.  After yelp and Google search found this place.  And I have to say it was worth the drive.  It looks pretty nice both inside and out.  Nice expansive cozy plaza and burger was good!  5 stars."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars here. I'm a big hamburger fan, and am always on the search for the next best burger. I've always heard B Spot being well-spoken of, so some friends and I ventured up to Woodmere following a Sunday night burger craving.   We had just come from a good hike, and fit right into the casual atmosphere in our boots and flannel. The place was full, but still didn't feel overly packed. Noise level was definitely on the loud side, but it fit the overall feel of the burger joint so no complaints there. Service was friendly and timely.  As for the important part...the burgers. I had expected more inventive options, but I suppose their array of unique sauces on each table are what's supposed to stand out. I went with the Funguy burger, and ordered it medium. It was cooked perfectly, pink and warm in the middle, and juicy as a good burger should be. A satisfying burger on all fronts. The fries were unfortunately mediocre, thin and overall unimpressive, especially considering they had to be ordered a la-carte. The rosemary seasoning was a nice touch, but not quite worth the extra bucks.  Overall, there was nothing that shouted \"WOW\" about my meal here. That being said, if I was already in the area and craving a solid burger, I'd willingly stop back."}
{"text":"Overall, very good.  The menu is pretty straight forward with a variety of burgers, salads, sandwiches, and brats. I tried the Thin Lizzy. The only thing that sucks is you can only omit items from the burgers..not add or change something. On the table there's a message from Symon saying thought went into the menu and how the burger toppings were meant to work together so no complaining...hmm okay. Anyway, it was delicious. My mom had the Symon Says and liked it alot. We each got an order of Lola fries.  (delicious!) The burger did get the bun kind of soggy, which I don't like but it was still good. They cooked my burger to a perfect medium.  They also have \"Bad Ass\" shakes..my mom got the chocolate banana marshmallow and it was the best milk shake I've ever had. Definitely worth the price. You can also had liquor to the shakes as well.   Overall, I liked it alot...probably not my favorite place for burgers but still very good. The prices aren't bad..just a little inflated. But the meat is quality and is worth it. I'll come here again sometime."}
{"text":"Cheese whiz on fries?! Who knew!  I got a burger and the porky fries for take-out. The burger was delicious and cooked nicely, though not as juicy as I expected. Bun was a nice, sturdy, buttery roll. Grilled onions are perfect. The pork on the fries was delicious - but the little shoestring potatoes weren't quite substantial enough to hold up to the heavy toppings. I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great burger! Even better chips.  Servers at burger joints always ask how you want your burger cooked. I always say medium and have maybe received an actual medium burger a couple of times. I got the Lola burger and it was perfect medium. A bit pricey but this is a pretty high rent area. I would definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Often, even the highest expectations are doomed to the perils of dissappointment; however, at B-Spot, the sheer brilliance of Michael Symon  is put on full display! This premium burger joint crafts 16 different burgers from fresh ground beef and complements them with a range of toppings and warm toasted buns! There is also a full bar that offers a full selection of ales, drafts, wines, and other options. After glancing the menu, I opted for the \"Impossible Burger,\" a meatless sensation that will actually trick you into thinking that you've bitten into an all beef pattie, it was fantastic! Lastly, I decided to relapse from my normally healthy eating habits and ordered a chocolate banana marshmallow shake, a $7 calorie infused sinfully delicious concoction that was spectacularly amazing!"}
{"text":"Man, that is annoying.  Placed a take-out order at the bar.  25 minutes later I asked the bartender where the order was and it had been sitting at the stand at the front of the restaurant getting cold for 10 minutes.  Not that hard.  Also, turkey burger disgustingly undercooked (like unhygenically) and salad gloppy (though  bartender indicated all dressings were on the side).   I've been here 20-30 times and while it's not my favorite burger around there are things on the menu I like (Old School Thick Cut Salami sandwich, among them).  Still, so many chefs are doing this downmarket thing and Bspot definitely seems like its slippin'.  Borocco is opening something in Crocker Park which I'm hoping will be worth skipping this place for."}
{"text":"I'm surprised B Spot only has 3.5 stars so far!   I'm a big fan, even with my grumbles about the recent menu change. For some reason they took away the \"Symon Says\" rules, which really gave the place character, and erase a handful of (really special!) burgers off the menu, including the one with gyro meat, which was my boyfriend's favorite, the vegetarian Shroomage, and the Blue Cow, one of my favorites. Now there is a \"build your own burger\" option which isn't as great as it seems because the ingredient pricess add up quickly. I also think that this freedom isn't something M. Symon would have approved of in his set of rules!   Alas: I STILL give B Spot a full five stars. My favorite burger is currently the New Jack City, which features avocado, roasted red peppers, red onion, pepperjack cheese, and salsa verde. AND chorizo sausage. Delicious! The classic Lola Burger with its egg and bacon is also a fan favorite.   I also have to write something about the milkshakes, like many before me. SO GOOD! I'd recommend specifically going in the winter and hoping that the seasonal milkshake is the brownie cinnamon, which wins for the best milkshake I've ever had.   AND! Lola fries. Covered in rosemary. Get them, too. Perfect for two to share. There is a selection of dipping sauces, of which the best are the Lola ketchup (tastes like ...ketchup with a curry kick) and the balsamic steak sauce.   Yes, I love B Spot, even with the recent loss of character and part of its menu!"}
{"text":"This place really hit the gourmet burger spot!!! Will definitely come here again.   We were seated outside and loved it since it was such a beautiful day. My husband and I ordered the Yo burger and New Jack City burger along with the Lola fries.   Wait time was a bit long but worth the wait!!    The burgers were amazing. Cooked perfectly and they even have a pickle bar. They have an array of sauces you can dip with but our fav was the Shasha sauce.   To sum it up, we loved this place and will come again!"}
{"text":"Worst turkey burger I ever had. Service wasn't that good either, for some reason they were in great hurry. No drink refills."}
{"text":"I know all the excitement about BSpot, so I was ready to try it officially (the one at the cavs arena is great). But unfortunately, this one was just okay. There are 3 things that turned me off.  A. I was waiting for my friend who was very late and wanted to order one of the bar items as an app and was told they don't do that, you have to order everything together. What? B. The price. It was on the high side for burgers, which is fine, but it better be the best, and it just wasn't. $15 for a soda burger and fries that are just good is too high.  C. The bun. I heard they use to have one that was denser. This one falls apart and is too soft for the meat laden sandwiches.  It is cool looking inside, the waiter was very pleasant and I floated away on my diet coke refills, but I probably won't be back. Unless they change A and C. B is what it is for a much buzzed about spot."}
{"text":"The worst veggie burger ever! It was absolutely flavorless. The two stars are for the big blue salad (something like that), which was tasty (without the bacon) if you like blue cheese:-)"}
{"text":"love Michael Symon ... but not his new burger joint ... overpriced good food ... and you can't have a burger made your way and they are small for $6-$10, no sides ... and nothing special ... 5 guys is just as good for a lot less ... sorry Mike"}
{"text":"A refreshingly unique menu. Great burgers and brats with topping combinations that set this place apart from the chain restaurants. Make sure to hit up the pickle bar. Love the beer selection. Something for everyone"}
{"text":"Well... We wanted to eat... But we were told to \"come back in 10 min we don't open until 11:30a\". Really??? 21 degrees outside and you want me to come back in 10 minutes! Guess I am not eating burgers!"}
{"text":"Like a true Clevelander I have been to B-Spot many times and various locations.  One thing I can say is you truly receive the same product no matter where you are, but to me the product is just a little blah.   I have tried a few of the different burgers and the only one I really come back to is The Gobbler. It really isn't great, their turkey burgers are a little tough, but I keep coming back just because I like avocado and siracha mayo.  After I eat it, I am not necessarily disappointed but I am also not satisfied.  The best thing about B-Spot in my opinion is the pickle bar, I love jalapenos and all the different flavored pickles.  I would probably be better off making a meal out of that and the french fries.    They do have a great atmosphere for a beer and a burger, so that is why you will find yourself coming back."}
{"text":"Big name chef attracts plenty of out of towners and locals alike. The burger and shake were fantastic but the salads are terrible and a complete rip off.  Of course we have favorite dishes at certain places, but we can't support you if half of your menu is garbage and you expect a premium for it to boot."}
{"text":"After a friendly greeting and 30 minute wait, we were seated. The evening started with a mixup in the milkshake order, with a member of our party receiving the wrong shake, which was then redelivered (half-drunk and without apology by our server) to another member before being determined as a totally unordered shake upon the arrival of our actual shakes. Our shake, ordered with bourbon, was bourbonless.   The food arrived. My girlfriend's grilled cheese was congealed and not melted. It also lacked any peppers or real flavor, with only a few pieces of lettuce in addition to the cold cheese. My stadium brat was nothing special, slathered in stadium mustard and soggy grilled onions. The brat itself was unsatisfyingly soft and mushy inside. Upon receiving our check, we were charged for the extra shake but the lack of bourbon was addressed in our ordered shake price. When we asked our waitress to correct the bill, she removed the wrong shake so we were charged for the non existant bourbon. Finally, our bills were corrected and we paid, although we had to wait an extended period of time for the to-go boxes after the rest of our party had left.   My seat was directly under a dripping air vent, which did little to improve the overall experience. Our service was not spectacular,  with little effort to correct the numerous errors and no water refills whatsoever. The shakes were good. The onion rings were good. Just stick to the burgers over other meal options."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the menu the service and certainly will try them again when I am out this way again"}
{"text":"B Spot is my favorite burger place of all time. There are so many options, my favorite being the build your own burger option. I get grilled chicken with egg, avocado, american cheese, and bacon and it is to die for. I love the bread that they use for the burgers as well. The fries make B Spot stand out because they have a special taste that make them like no other. The milkshakes are magnificent as well. Chocolate is my favorite and I highly recommend it. The service is fast and the place has overall feel-good vibes."}
{"text":"I come her roughly once a month.  I always sit at the bar alone or with my son.  I'm usually waited on by Linda or Sean and sometimes Jessica.  They are all friendly, knowledgeable, and unpretentious.    Speaking for the burger I get which I get every time , It's my favorite burger I've ever eaten.  Grilled onions, bacon, and white American cheese.  I could eat one every day.  The fries are always spot on and the cracklins are really good.  Really there isn't a burger that compares in my opinion.    Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food, tried the Red Hot, very spicy and flavorful.  Terrific selection of beers on draft. They were pretty busy on a Thursday night which is telling of great atmoshere and food.  Good place to go if you want a quick bite or want to hang out and go deep into their extensive beer menu.  I'll be back when I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Bspot is a great restaurant. It's cozy and has delicious food. The restaurant itself has the open wall that leads outside which I love. I also love their fries because they have Rosemary on them to give them a little extra flavor. The burgers are a perfect size for me and it's cooked just how I like. The service is great and since its in Crocker, it's nice to walk around after (or before if there is a wait). I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My first time here, service is prompt and friendly. I was given a recommendation on a beer that compared to the beer I usually drink, and I got the Lola burger. It was very good. The onion rings were tasty, the fries were just barely warm. That was the only thing that was an issue. Otherwise 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with the B Spot. My burger was way over done, (I asked for medium rare & there was not a spot of pink in the patty). The patty was much smaller than the bun so half of my meal was without meat. Also, their pickle bar that everyone raves about was below average: it looked like everything was sitting out for a while, things were so dried out and it looked extremely unappetizing. Our server was very nice though! Overall, I will not be back to the B Spot."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in and check out the new burger they added to the menu. The atmosphere is nice, lots of seating, large bar with seating and a nice self serve pickle bar. The service was great and food arrived quickly. The menu selections are nice from burgers, blogs, brats, salads and creative milk shakes.   We ordered the new addition to the menu, The impossible burger. This burger contains no animal products but is not gluten or soy free. This burger has the taste and texture of a beef burger, it even sears and cooks like beef and yes it even bleeds like a nice medium rare burger should. I would have to say this burger tops any veggie burger out there. B spot cooked the burgers to perfection, great seasoning, nice soft buns and the addition of that egg yolk was amazing. We will definitely return for that burger."}
{"text":"The burgers here just fantastic!  This paired up with the excellent beer selections make it one of my favorite burger joints.    I still say a silent prayer every now and then asking for In & Out Burger to come to Ohio."}
{"text":"A decent spot, though a bit over priced. I think the michael simon affiliation kind of iver hyoed and over priced it. But not bad by any means!!! Worth a try for some creative toppings if you like, but none impressed me as fabtastic when tried em"}
{"text":"You know, I really want to love this place and I just don't get excited about it. I think people are more excited about the brand rather than the food. The burgers are ok, I've had better and menu not fantastic. Actually, it's a menu if you want a heart attack. Not a great selection at all.   I went twice and still feel there is no chemistry between me and B-Spot. I guess it hasn't hit my spot. I'd rather go to five guys for half the price..."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the area. Don't miss the shakes."}
{"text":"B Spot's food is fine, however it feels like more of a novelty. The prices are reasonable, portions are sufficient, employees are pleasant, but the food does not compel me to return."}
{"text":"If you're interested in.a meager run-of-the-mill burger, this review isn't for you. But, if, on the other hand, you happen to love your tummy, this is for you.  My wife and I ordered the cheese burger, root beer, fries and onion rings. Let's talk about the burger.  The first bite electrifies the pilate. A burger by a gourmet chef takes you to Nirvana and back! Your mouth literally excites with the flavors. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have had!! Much go to :-) i ordered the porky burger and it was amazing!! The fries are to die for. Beer was awesome! It is a great atmosphere and I absolutely love the location!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm I love B Spot.  I live in Pittsburgh, but am originally from Cleveland and always try to make a point to head to B-spot when I go back home.  The Red Hot burger is my favorite. The Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake with bourbon is amaaaazing.  Great beer selection. I couldn't believe it when I saw they sell my FAVORITE cheap \"old school\" beer, Genesee Cream Ale for $2 (which is hard to find in Pittsburgh).    Michael Symon is my food soul mate with his self-described \"meat-centric\" cooking.  B-spot is definitely not for the faint-hearted or veggie-inclined (although a vegeterian friend of mine liked this place quite a bit)."}
{"text":"Survey asks \"Outdoor seating?\" I guess if you are in the first row when the overhead door is open, isn't that outside? First time there, usually too crowded when we go by, went for late lunch, my wife ordered \"Lola\" burger, (she loved it) onion rings (they were great) I ordered a \"Bambino\" burger, server asked \"how do you want it done\" I said \"almost burnt\" I had to send it back, 2nd was about 10% better(more cooked), I ate 1/2 of the 2nd burger. I told the server about the \"Cowboy\" burger at Applebees...WOW what a burger! People say the chefs/Cooks don't like to cook/burn/overcook a steak or burger, I don't care  I\"M paying for it, not them, in all fairness I would go back and try their most popular burger (don't remember which one)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Burgers are black angus. Excellent service. I got the Lola which was good & messy. My fiancé ordered the turkey burger which was \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Came here for the burgers, but wow, was really impressed by the lime and cilantro wings, so bright, fresh, and delicious!    For the main course I went with a pretty tame bacon cheeseburger (Swiss) that I found to be satisfying.  And for dessert, a Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake.  It was very well mixed, each sip containing both bacon and a hint of apple pie flavor.    Although I'm usually of the opinion that bacon makes everything better, I think maybe the the milkshake was a bit much, albeit pairing with a bacon cheeseburger might have contributed to that.  I kind of wished that it was less well mixed or maybe even layered so that I could alternate between enjoying the vanilla bean apple pie and the bacon flavor and texture."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to complain about slow service, but this is just a whole new level. How in the f**k does it take 40+ minutes to cook 3 burgers and a handful of fries, In a half empty restaurant on a Wednesday night. Never again mike symon, never again.   P.S. Mabel's also sucks"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 14-February-2017 Time of my visit: Lunch  My co-worker took me out to lunch to this place.  The joint was not packed, but was busy.  We were promptly seated and our waiter came over relatively quickly.  I ordered some iced tea and started to look through the menu.  I ended up settling on a cheeseburger.  What I did not realized (but my co-worker knew) was the burger did not come with any sides.  So he ordered onion rings to share.  Our food arrived relatively quickly.  What I found interesting was there was a pickled bar toppings, which had several interesting choices.  After loading up on those toppings, I proceeded to consume my food.  The burger was alright, as I was expecting it to be.  The onion rings were pretty decent.  I liked the way they were seasoned.  Overall, it was a B experience."}
{"text":"I've been here several time and it's always good. Today I was blown away with sheer B Spot awesomeness. The Fat Doug was maybe the best burger to enter my mouth. The chili cheese fries were dang tasty too. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Overpriced, overcrowded, over-hipster.  The food IS good, but not worth what you pay for it.  And the worst thing about this particular location: They hold tables for people with their Call Ahead Seating, so you can show up and half the restaurant's empty, but you'll still have to wait 30 minutes for a table.  To me, if you're going to turn away a paying customer who's standing there in lieu of someone who might show up, you're doing fine and don't need my business."}
{"text":"Been here many times, food has been consistently great, and they always cook your burger to the exact done-ness you had asked for. Service is solid, even though it's always new faces every time we go. They use high-quality meat here, too. Although they've changed the brand of kimchi for the pickle bar, and it's not as good as the kind they used when the restaurant just opened.. Still decent though."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland this past week and stopped by B Spot. So glad I did! This place a very cool atmosphere. We walked and was warmly greet and taken to our seats. The menu had so many delicious options! I order The Gobbler with rosemary fries! So good!! AND I was excited to see that they had a pickle bar to further dress my burger. Be sure to check out their happy hour menu for more delicious deals!"}
{"text":"New Jack City burger was about the best burger I've had.  I was trying to decide between it and the French onion burger.  Thanks to my waitress for the recommendation!  My only issue was the price.  It was more expensive than I would have expected for a burger with no sides.  They should include fries with the burger, or at least served more with the side order.  The atmosphere was fun.  I like the giant B made out of beer cans.  I'd give it 5 stars if they weren't so stingy with the fries."}
{"text":"Creamsicle Shake is here!!!  Oh, I waited so long for you.  And you did not disappoint me my sweet thing.  You were refreshing and summery.  Let's rendezvous again, before June is gone!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, porky fries and onion rings. Vast beer selection. Great kimchi and pickle bar. Wonderful selection of sauces at the table (sha-sha, etc). The service was spotty/unexperienced and the policy that you can't even slightly change specifications on the specialty burgers was strange (and something they should specify on the menu rather than wait to have a server inform you of this when you are ready to order).  The huge sign at the entrance explaining that they don't appreciate whiny customers and that patrons should just be happy with what they get is a poor choice in terms of creating a hospitable setting. Great food, but certain questionable components."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to tonight and more than disappointed to ay the least. There are a few notable things I would like to mention:  1) The atomic burger is an above average burger made with creekstone beef; however at $10.75 without any fries or sides included is way way way overpriced given the small portion size.   2) They fry everything in lard. This is actually a huge deal in that literally nearly everything contains pork which excludes many potential diners with dietary restriction (ie religious). Additionally this makes the food (unnecessarily) significantly heavier and unhealthier without adding much quality.   3) They do have one fryer that contains vegetable oil however they will only fry French fries and gluten-free menu items in this as to maintain gluten-free options. However this means you cannot get onion rings, onion strings, chicken sandwich, etc without it being deep fried in lard.   Very dissatisfied. Will not return again. In comparison to a Red Robin burger, this burger is inferior in taste and portion size. Additionally, it is more expensive than RR, does not come fries, and the menu is very restricted if you don't want your food fried in lard."}
{"text":"It is fine. Does not compare to bar cento/bier market. Service is fine, shakes are runny--spoon must be to help get up the milk since the shake is more milk than ice cream. Everything is a la carte. Fries $4, shakes $5, burgers, brats, bologna range $6-11. The drinks look good, but $9/drink was a bit too steep for me."}
{"text":"lol, and now my review of B Spot (with Rachel B's express permission even though she's sick of reading these reviews over and over again!).  I'll be short and sweet....  Came an hour before a Brown's game kickoff, no waiting but the waitress wanted to put little ole me at a table for 4 by myself, I decided against it and moved over to the bar for a little more atmosphere and to free up a table for them.  Bartender was great, good conversationalist and recommended a really nice beer for me to try (Great Lakes Oktoberfest).  I liked that he was willing to answer my questions about the local beers and alter what he suggested based on what I enjoyed.  Tremendous beer knowledge!  Plus, he knew exactly why Sept. 1st held a special spot in my heart when it comes to local ice cream....Mitchell's pumpkin spice comes out that day, mmmmmm....and then he said to come back in a couple of weeks when some of the pumpkin ales comes out so he could walk me through them, great personal attention!  I got the \"Yo\" burger and it was just cooked just right, not overly big which I'm glad for b/c the toppings really fill you up.  Also liked all the condiments on the table, especially their coffee BBQ sauce.  Lola fries were ok, probably wouldn't get them again, may have to try the onion rings next time.  Since I had to get in a couple of hours of studying tonight, I decided to get the chocolate espresso shake for my after-dinner meal!  Thick, great tasting and so much espresso I was practically vibrating on my drive home  ;o)  As someone who works in the field of CT surgery, doing bypasses on people, I fully endorse the excess bacon and fatty, carby goodness of the B Spot, just contact me in about 20 years when you need those coronary arteries taken care of, drop Michael Symon's name and I'll be sure to give you a discount!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and was very impressed.  Tried the New Jack City burger and Lola Fries. The creamy avocado and chorizo were an incredible combination on the burger. I don't think I've ever had more delicious fries.  The ginger and rosemary made it hard to stop eating them. The kids meals were a good size and reasonably priced.  My husband got the Yo Burger and it came well done instead of medium as he'd ordered. They offered to make him a new one and the manager stuck around while he cut into it to make sure it was right. On top of that they only charged him for half his burger. I really want to try one of their shakes (with the added shot of liqueur ). They sound really good. The food is so yummy and filling who knows if I'll ever have room for dessert.  Kudos to Michael Simon.    The weather was nice that day and they had the whole storefront was open. Made for a very pleasant lunchtime."}
{"text":"Love the B Spot! Great Burgers and Fabulous onion rings! Love it we go there all the time!!!!"}
{"text":"First time to the Cleveland area in about 25 years.  When we travel we always look for something new to eat and try to stay away from the chains we have back home in NOVA.  We found The B Spot in upscale Crocker Park.  The atmosphere of the town center and restaurant was upscale.  The food at the B Spot was great!  This is probably the best burger that I have had!!!  Not sure what it was called, but it had cole slaw and pastrami on it.  It was well cooked, moist, and had great flavor!  It was a little pricey for a hamburger, but well worth it to us.  We don't mind paying for good food."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Michael Symon for awhile and I was excited to try out B Spot since I was in the area on a business trip. I was not disappointed, this was quite possibly one of the best burgers I had ever eaten.  I had the Shroomage burger and it was excellent. The meat was cooked exactly as ordered, the pickle bar and fries were great and my friends and I were seated quickly. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Complete waste of time! Just because a celebrity chef's name is on it does NOT make it good.  Here was my experience: *Three hostesses, none smiled or gave a warm greeting to anyone, actually acted like it was a hassle to even be there. * Surly and non engaging staff everywhere. * Burger was nothing special at all and actually didn't feel very well after eating it. Yes, it was cooked at the right temp, but, is the really so important to note (as in so many other reviews)?? That should be a given, no?? * Had the \"Lola fries\", absolutely nothing special here, very salty. Mine came out cold, when I asked the bartender if she could replace with a fresh/hot order she had to verify with the manager (that they were actually cold)??!! REALLY??!! For a $1 happy hour order of fries??  Next time I'll stick with Yours Truly, take the drive to ABC or find a place that cares beyond the hype of the owner's name."}
{"text":"B Spot is a casual burger restaurant. The burgers and fries are a' la carte. Fry orders are big enough to share. Every time I go here my burger is cooked to the perfect temperature (my go to is medium).  My favorite burger here is the Fun Guy, I love the onion, mushroom and blue cheese combo. They have a condiment bar where you can add pickles and such to your burgers. They also have their own house made ketchup and some other sauces/ mustards you can try. I've tried a few of the brats but I always say one day I will try the bologna and shakes. You can get the shakes with liquor added so I don't know why I haven't tried these yet."}
{"text":"Went back to give it another try and adjusted my order to see if I could get the juicy, bloody burger I was craving. By ordering my burger rare I got the moist, juciness I would expect in medium rare - so - now I know. I just got the basic cheeseburger and it was delicious.  I went for the Porky Fries again - added the pickled onions from the fixin's bar to the jalepenos already included in the order and was in HEAVEN.  I still think Chef Flay has a slight edge on the burger, but CHef Symon's Porky Fries blow Flay's sweet potato fres out of the ball park. Point: Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Invited by brother to go back with an open mind.  This time at the Crocker Park location.  One that I suggested was long overdue after Symon's disappointing attempt with Bar Symon in Avon Lake (that I'll blame on his poor partnering with investors hell bent on reviving their failed shopping plaza).  This restaurant is conveniently located next to Champp's near the bookstore and movie theater, with surface lots not far from the entrance.  Next door there's a frozen yogurt store, giving a great dessert option.  The restaurant decor is inspired by the other B Spot locations featuring lots of stainless steel, and as Kramer says, \"wood is good.\"  It's not bad for a burger bar.  Our server was pleasant, but boy their little PDA order-taking-doohickies don't bode well for simple requests or changes.  I'm told there's a rule there, \"Symon Says,\" which quite honestly is rubbish.  Lawfully there can't be an absolute \"Symon Says,\" if he expects to operate a business in Ohio as he and his staff still needs to take into account substitutions and subtractions for food allergies...so Symon can s*ck it.  First the drink orders.  Asked for a Coke, received an over sugared Pepsi...no harm, I shouldn't be drinking that cr*p anyways--but still a pet peeve to any Coke fan that cares.  Server takes our orders.  I ask for a cheeseburger, no lettuce, no tomato, no onion.  Server is just about to walk away, and goes, \"oh wait, I forgot the specials.\"  \"It's a burger, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and special sauce with potato chips.\"  Ok, just add potato chips to my burger.....[[hesitation]] \"Uhh, I can't do that.\"  Ok, may I please have the burger special, but no lettuce, no tomato, and no special sauce.  \"Sure, I think I can do that...lemme check.\"    You know what Symon is really saying right now?--I just duped CLE with a cheap knock-off of a Bobby Flay Crunchified Burger (http://www.bobbysburgerpalace.com/files/image_gallery/15e976c7d5c4330fbdd1f53e56f1488a_full_size.jpg)  The burger arrived, it looked good, but the chips that Symon uses suck.  They're awful...they tasted stale.  Moral of the story is...don't order a knock-off Crunchified burger and expect the best.  Bill comes...$48 for three at the restaurant that was purported prior to it's opening to offer Clevelander's \"a place to stop in, grab a burger and a beer for $10.\"  Symon had a fantastic dream, a wonderful idea, but horrible execution.  The burgers--unoriginal stale knock offs of other chefs.   The pickle bar--disgusting, a public health violation. The drinks--don't expect what you order.  Me thinks not, and me thinks I'm not going to be returning."}
{"text":"This is the best B Spot of the bunch. If you're going for B Spot, go to Strongsville. Parking is easy, there's rarely (never?) a wait for a table and service is friendly here.  It's no 5 star dining experience but for a burger chain, it's A-OK. The milkshakes are a must-have. The beer selection is passable but not excellent."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this location. The parking lot is always full despite the mall being nearly vacant. I always have to wait for a table here even though it is never at capacity. Service is not terribly friendly.  On a food basis, I would give this place 4 stars. I've got my favorites like the Lola Burger and Stadium Style Brat and the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake. The food is good but the menu never rotates and the Gestapo developed rules for efficiency. No substitutions, the food will all be served at the same time (no appetizers) except the shakes which come out first and not with the meal.  If you're looking for an inexpensive, local place to take somebody, it's good. Go for it. If you can, go to the Strongsville location for a better experience and the same food."}
{"text":"Who would think that one of my most memorable meals would be at a burger place? Not me, that's for sure, but my trip to B Spot was absolutely in my top 10 meals of my life and the only reason I am rating it a 4 is because I believe the chips with the parm fondue were poorly executed (chips were more soggy than crisp and the fondue was far too stiff). But, everything else I had there was amazing. The rosemary fries? Perfect. The lola burger? Awesome. The vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake? Oh my lord, am I in heaven now?   Yes, if you go, you must get that milkshake, you must. Still the best milkshake of my life (and I've had my fair share). At first I thought five dollars for a milkshake was a little too much but, you get enough for two people or two servings for yourself and it's the best milkshake ever so just pony up and get it, okay? I also dug the atmosphere, the great service, and the humor found in Symon Says. Any time I'm in the Cleveland area you'll definitely be finding me making a visit to B Spot again."}
{"text":"Michael Symon, I hope you or one of your staff read this.  WRONG #1: I had a burger craving. First thing I'm told is \"NO SUBSTITUTIONS\". I'm not a big substitutor, but it just creates a bad vibe that goes against making the diner happy.  WRONG #2: Being ignored for 5 minutes before being approached by someone who is not even your server if you want drinks. There were plenty of people staff around and I'd see them chit-chatting in the corners of the restaurant. It was not even full capacity.  WRONG #3: I got the portabello sandwich. Nothing special. Not a good sign when you have to add salt and pepper to your sandwich to flavor it! My husband quietly ate his burger, said it was nothing special.  WRONG #4: I had bacon in my sandwich. It was cold and not crispy. I asked the server if they can crispy my bacon, and THEY JUST FRIED IT! So it became so crunchy it was inedible. Absolute laziness.  Do yourself a favor and head over to FIVE GUYS. Cheaper, quicker service, custom sandwiches and they just taste better!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Best burgers of our lives. Our 2.5 year old twins loved it too. I had the atomic burger, my husband had the Lola burger with Lola fries. Our kids had grilled cheese and Greek yogurt. We loved the healthy choices for the kids!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and expensive as heck. The portions were small. I had a burger and fries and my bill for just me was $15 not including gratuity or a beverage. The service was not much better than the food. Our order took about 30 minutes to arrive at the at the table from the time we ordered. There were several people in our party and everyone got their food at different times despite our order being placed all at once, which made eating somewhat awkward. I will never return to B-Spot. Save your money and go to Melt Bar and Grilled."}
{"text":"B Spot was very solid.  The food was good, the service was great.  It was especially nice to have a pickle bar and plenty of milkshake options.  Obviously it is a bit more expensive than your average burger joint, but I would argue that B Spot burgers are anything but average.  I liked the Lola fries and chili-cheese fries too."}
{"text":"I was visiting in Cleveland and decided to check this place out because I enjoy Michael Symon. I really loved the concept and the food.  It had an extensive beer list and a pickle bar to boot.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place serves the kind of food that makes me want to sit in the corner, not talk to anyone, and eat by myself like an animal that just killed its prey.  I ordered the New School (fried bologna with russian dressing, pickled onions, sweet hot pickles, fried egg, $6.00), and found it unsettlingly satisfying.  If you're looking for heart-stopper type fare, I can't think of any place that does it better than this.  It's funny, I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews--not sure why.  I loved this place.  Good:  Food that scratches the itch.  Great design, fun space.  Good beer selection.  Bad: Too noisy, a bit too small, and frankly I'd like to see a bigger beer selection.  I will be back--possibly by myself.  Look for me in the corner."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had. The menu had great options. This isn't the place for you if you don't love meat."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries, and bourbon/draft beer selection. Need more??? There is a small but effective pickle bar."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, great beer selection (although they were out of several when I was there on a Tuesday) and deeply delicious shakes. I'm not sure I need anything more in life..."}
{"text":"I haven't had their burgers yet, so I feel weird writing a review, but their happy hour is excellent!  I was waiting for an appointment time at the Apple Store in the same shopping center and decided to stop in B Spot for a snack.  Luckily, from 3 PM to 6 PM every Monday through Friday, this is a cheap plan!  Draft beer is $3, and this includes nice local options, not just Coors Light.  The server helpfully steered me toward an excellent IPA out of Cincinnati.  A generous order of fries is only $1-- they're perfectly crispy skinny fries, and I'm not sure what exactly Lola Ketchup is but it's excellent.  If I find myself in the area again I'm definitely trying their burgers or happy hour sliders.  Food Network, you haven't steered me wrong yet."}
{"text":"Really Liked it a lot. We went here hopeing to eat some awesoe bugers, we got what we paid for, we really liked the food. The only thing we didnt  like are the fries. Next time i will get onion rings."}
{"text":"Interesting place to see.  For a restaurant, things are high tech and obviously expensive.  The servers use electronic pads to enter your food order.    I assume this cuts way down on them getting orders wrong, and it apparently helps in getting the food out quicker.  They turn people over very quickly, your food getting to your table remarkably fast.  Our server was very helpful and attentive, giving us excellent service.    We were both disappointed with the fries.  They are the shoestring type, which I don't care for, but the flavoring of them just wasn't that good.  We also tried an order of onion rings, and they were completely unremarkable, below average.  The burgers though were quite good.  Not the best I've ever had but certainly above average.  They are small though.  The wife had a root beer float which she loved.  So we probably will stop in again sometime when in the area, but we wouldn't go out of our way to go here."}
{"text":"So this burger place is in a strip mall.  Yeah, maybe if you're on your vacation to Cleveland a strip mall in the burbs is not the top destination.  Fortunately, the food was very tasty.  Michael Symon definitely cooks that Pat La Frieda beef up good (and being from NJ, I know La Frieda beef).  I loved the pickle bar and ate maybe more pickled things than are truly appropriate.   My only complaint is that there is so much on the burgers that adding pickles and Lola ketchup and all the other wonderful condiments is almost too much.  I ate a burger with cheese and grilled onions while the boyfriend got something also towards the plain end of the spectrum.  This was a good thing!  The chips and parmesan fondue?  Also a good thing, especially when the waitress offered me a take out container for the chips AND the leftover fondue.  Delicious car food!  I liked it a lot, and if I lived near there I would eat at B Spot probably more often than necessary.  But I'm not dreaming about it."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  Good beer selection. Friendly service.  Consistent quality visit to visit.  The pickle bar is my favorite."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm showing my age, but I would've rated B Spot as a 5 when it first opened. Now.....not so much. Frankly put the burgers have taken a nosedive. All of them, especially my favorite Yo burger. They used to be juicy, messy, and ridiculously delicious. It's why there's a roll of paper towels on each table!  Out of nostalgia I ordered the Yo, hoping it'd be topped with a rainbow of pickled peppers on a hefty hand formed patty. Nope. The patty looked like it came from McD's, a minuscule hockey puck which came out dry even though it was cooked medium-rare. The peppers had very little kick, and even though there's a pickle bar. Adding more wouldn't have saved the dry burger.  Thankfully there are a FEW items that haven't changed. Namely the always decadent Bacon Apple Pie milkshake and the Lola fries. I'd might come back for snacks and drinks, but if I want a burger. I'll pass on B Spot."}
{"text":"Superior Pickle bar  Kinda pricey  Great sauces   Money shakes  my favorite part of the casino  they know how to cook'em"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on a Sunday night. We expected to have to wait for a table, but we were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. The decor of the restaurant is great, and the food is even better.  We got the Porky burger and the Lola burger, and both were out of this world. The flavors were spectacular, and the portions were just right. We got the Lola fries and onion rings as sides. The fries were great, but the onion rings weren't anything special to me.  We are from California, but visit Cleveland 3 or 4 times a year, and this place will be a must eat every visit."}

{"text":"Timed our shopping to make a stop here at Happy Hour.  Tried once before for lunch but there was absolutely nowhere to park. My meal was just under $9 for what would have been $30 easily for lunch or dinner.  Had the Plain Jane as I only wanted tomato and onion for a change. Lettuce is included, too. The Lola sandwich is protein overload for me. Knew what to expect for fries as we've frequented Michael's other locations. I chose onion rings instead and enjoyed them. They arrived hot and stayed that way longer then most.  My iced tea was refilled at no extra charge and the whole visit from exiting the car to leaving took only an hour and we were home at dusk.  I have one more MS location to visit and will have seen them all. I was more satisfied tonight than at some of the others."}
{"text":"B Spot is Iron Chef Michael Symon's burger (and bratwurst and bologna) joint in the Cleveland area. The restaurant is worth a lunchtime visit but it will be a little short of Iron Chef expectations.  I had the Bacon Cheesburger with Lola Fries and a beanless meat Chili to go. While the burger was not the best I've ever tasted, it was definitely in the top 25% of the many burgers I have had in my day. The meat was very fresh and not too salty, which IMHO is the key to letting the flavor of the meat come through.  The burger was done to a perfect medium, but was a tad greasy. The bacon was thick and tasty, the onion, tomato and lettuce were fresh and crunchy and the cheddar cheese made the combo whole.  The Lola fries were fried slightly crispy in Peanut Oil and had a subtle salt and rosemary taste, but the shoestring cut required several in hand at one time to get ketchup on them.  My to-go chili was small (it is an appetizer after all) and, like the burger, it was decent but not the best chili I've had. The taste was a little bland, though the dish was deceptively spicy.  Overall, the food was better than average, though not tremendous, and the service was pretty spotty - they screwed up two things on our order. To the positive, the bill was quite reasonable. Worth a try...but keep your expectations tempered. It's a decent - just decent - burger joint."}
{"text":"They do not cater to vegetarians unless you want to pay $16 dollars for your burger. I tried to order the New Jack Burger without chorizo sausage and to sub out a black bean patty.... Yea that's all... And the bartender told me no. If I wanted the black bean burger I had to a.) order it the way it came off the menu which was drab and boring provolone cheese and mayo or b.) build my own black bean burger. Now the new jack city burger with a meat patty costs $10 dollars on the menu. It features avocado, pepper jack cheese, roasted red peppers, chorizo sausage, and a salsa verde. When I added up the items on my build your own burger with no chorizo sausage and a veggie patty the burger cost damn near $15 dollars. I get that they don't want substitutions but I don't see the big deal in subbing out a veggie patty for a meat one... When asked to speak with manager she said the same thing. No. Being in the restaurant business I cannot imagine telling a guest no when you have all the means and ingredients to sastify them!  I left B spot without eating and have no intention on returning."}
{"text":"The name Michael Symon inspires notions of fantastic flavors and succulent entrees. I agree with Mike N who says its a glorified fast food joint.  The menu offers an array of gourmet flavor combinations. I got the porky burger that came with bacon coleslaw and pulled pork. My friend had the fried bologna, which reminded her of her Alabama roots. My burger was ok. It wasn't juicy but was cooked to order. The only bbq option was one with coffee, odd. It was all decent enough but not great. Don't bother asking about substitutions, Symons put a big sign on the wall that says you can't. Apparently they are already paired to perfection and your addition isn't going to help.  I ordered a side of onion rings and my friends ordered chili-cheese fries. The onion rings were great, but pricy at $6 for a regular-sized side. The chili-cheese fries were ok. The chili was a bit too sweet, not enough cheese and too expensive at $8. I'm not balking at the price per say. I am willing to pay for for something that is worth it. These items were good but just run of the mill.  A friend tried the vanilla, apple-pie bacon milk shake. It too was interesting but not delicious. The vanilla, apple-pie was sweet but the bacon aftertaste was not delicious.  The worst part of our experience was our waiter, Ben. He was way too cool for school. He never explained the pickle bar. He rarely checked on our drinks. He also didn't offer any suggestions even after we told him we'd never been there. Thank goodness for a mnager that picked up his slack. Also, don't ask for ranch, they don't have any Ben snootilly declared.  I have no need to go back. It was something worth trying once. Go to Melt, 5 Guys or even Red Robin for a better burger or sandwich in a friendlier atmosphere"}
{"text":"First impression the host was rushed and it showed in how he communicated with me, brash, repetitive, firm basically rude! A rash of Burger Joints have opened up in Atlanta where I live, after you've been to a number of them you see that its all the same stuff and its beginning to look like a fad. A fad that I like and will ride to the end!  After reading the wall of teaching me how to behave in public you really get insight into the concept! While it is kitschy and entertaining its does have a hidden message that marginalizes the customer if they actually have a complaint or sub standard service.  Call me old school but if I do know something about the owner and the inner circle, I look forward to mentioning it and am proud to share my knowledge, with the staff. It makes me feel in the know and somewhat important for a brief moment in time. It does not hurt anyone and I feel great. I would probably visit the restaurant more frequently.  Being told that this behavior is not wanted or recognized and valuable to the establishment really turned me off. Even though I think I understand your trying to be funny and light=hearted. It didn't land well at first impression.  The service was excellent, fast and efficient, the server was very informative and helpful. I like the, order everything at once concept.  The food was excellent as well. Everyone enjoyed the Burgers and variations. The Wings were amazing. The fries were cold and flavorless, way to thin to hold the heat long enough to enjoy.   I love the concept of a pickle bar but it looked underwhelming at best when we approached it. The entire place was well designed and looked great, somebody stopped when it came to the pickle bar, it looked like it didn't belong."}
{"text":"B spot was an extremely pleasant surprise. We went here on the recommendation of a bicycle shop owner located in Little Italy. He claimed that this place has the bomb burgers but I was very skeptical. It is owned/ran by the Iron Chef Michael Symon which if I'm honest seemed very gimmicky to me. However, even if it is a little gimmicky to eat at an Iron Chef's restaurant, this place is so worth it and is very delicious. I believe I had the best melt in my mouth burger here.   I had the Lola burger which comes with a sunny side up egg, bacon, pickled red onions and cheddar cheese. The meat in this burger when mixed with the runny egg just melts in your mouth. I added some fancy pickles from the pickle bar which added a great touch to the burger. Did you catch that, they have a pickle bar which is my favorite thing about this place. I love pickles and everything pickled. They have onions, pickles, kimchi, and many other pickled items. I had a side of the Lola fries with the burger which weren't really anything to write home about.   If I'm ever in Cleveland again and am craving a burger, this will be me spot... maybe that's why it is called b spot."}
{"text":"Can you do two things at once?  I mean two that stand in direct contradiction?  \"Help us help you!\"  sez the website.  Okay, great.  That's exactly what hospitality is, helping the customer.  Off to a good start, when...  \"No Whining!\"  (Their double caps, not mine.)  So, if there's something wrong, am I whining when I ask for it to be fixed?  Because, well, there IS something wrong, here.  Friday night.  Peak dining time, so we know there will be a wait.  Uh, can we sit at the bar and eat?  Sure!  Off to the bar, skipping the three-quarter hour wait.  Poifect.  Beer, wine, all those things which act as social lubricant.  Bartender is a chatty fellow, and when told this was our first visit, very informative.  Ordered \"Porky Fries,,\" as an appetizer.  We had been warned both by the menu and previous Yelp reviews that everything is delivered to table at one time.  Bam.  You get it all, right now.  Take it or leave it.  See that line out the door?  It's not like we give one RCH if we lose you as a customer.  She ordered a salad, I ordered a \"Chilly Willy\" burger.  Both came out of the kitchen in about ten minutes, fresh and tasty.  Then, bar-boy asks, \"Hey, how would you like some fries with that?\"  Um.  We ordered fries.  Ten minutes ago.  'Member?  \"Oh, uh...  the 'runner' dropped them on the kitchen floor.\"  Sure.  That's just what happened.  No way you forgot one third of our order, right?  It's early in the life-span of B Spot.  We'll try it again.  I wouldn't make special plans to return, or advise friends, or go out of my way.  When possible I avoid that whole retail wasteland strip-mall hell that is Strongsville.  And it sure feels the message was: we should just be thankful that they were willing to serve us at all.  That's not a good thing, in ANY business model.  (P.S:  The bad reviews are kind of comical.  Five Guys?  Really?  Those two places are worlds apart.  Aside from a burger, they could be on different planets.  Stop with the employee reviews.  It doesn't wash.)"}
{"text":"Repeat after me I shall never buy another drive thru burger again!  One plane Jane add some garlic dill pickles from the relish bar, Lola fries, & vanilla shake for me.  Oh what's this?  BBQ coffee sauce?  I'll have a little of that on top of my pickles.    Delish.  This place serves up good burgers.  Great fries.  Tasty shakes.  I hear they have a great beer selection as well.    Enough said."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and really loved it. But I have to say that it's really gone down hill. The last few times we went, our burgers were overcooked and the taste of the food in general is not what it was. The loaded milkshakes no longer taste loaded. Tonight, the hostess was outright rude to some people in line behind us. I can't speak to the other B Spots, but sad to say the Eton location isn't worth the money anymore."}
{"text":"Unless you've been living under a rock for the last few years you know who Michael Symon is. I won't bother providing a bio, you can look it up yourself. B Spot is Symon's answer to the celebrity chef-inspired burger joint. Actually, it's burgers, brats and beer. Simple yet effective. There are six locations scattered about the Cleveland area including one in the Gund Arena, I mean \"The Q\" and one in Cleveland Browns stadium, I mean FirstEnergy stadium. We paid our first visit to the Strongsville shop.  Located in a small space tucked away in the confines of a rather nondescript strip mall, B Spot is a little tricky to find. Seating about 50 the long-narrow space is decorated in warm inviting textures and features a couple of interesting design focal points including a wall of vintage beer cans and a giant blood red antler chandelier. It's a bit sick and twisted but in a good way. Sort of a visual representation of Symon's laugh.  The seating arrangement is a tad on the tight side. Metal chairs, wooden-topped bistro tables and a few larger booths lining the walls. The bar seats about 15 elbow to elbow. We were seated at a two-top in the banquette stage left. Talk about your tight quarters. The table was barely large enough for our food and with the sauces, paper towels, and salt and pepper shakers taking up about 20% of our available real estate we had to really be careful not to knock something on the floor. Before I forget, some of the sauces at the table were killer, specifically the coffee BBQ, balsamic steak sauce and B Spot ketchup. Get the fries so you can try them all.  It was a Tuesday about 5:15pm when we stopped in. We were greeted immediately upon entering. Not crowded but energetic. We were in the middle of the post-work happy hour slot. Speaking of happy hour, it was the main reason for our visit. $5 burgers, $3 draft beers.  The service, oh the service. Once again, I was underwhelmed. First, let me say that I'm all for introducing new technology in to the service industry if it improves the experience. Now let me say that the little handheld devices carried by the servers were very intrusive. Our server never looked up from hers the entire time she was interacting with us. It definitely put up a wall between us. It was sort of like trying to have a conversation with someone as they are tapping away on their smartphone. Another of my pet peeves was also illustrated - asking me what I want to drink before I've even gotten my coat off. Isn't this server 101? Give me a freakin minute to actually look at the beer list! Grrr.  Speaking of beer list, not a bad showing at B Spot. 24 draught selections, mostly craft, with about as many bottles will have something for just about every beer lover. I'm not a huge fan of how they were organized (from light to dark?) as I prefer by style, but I was able to quickly locate two winners, Troegs Hopback Amber - a hopped up, well balanced amber ale - and Jolly Pumpkin's Weizen Bam - a tart, wheat offering I found refreshing and light.  The menu is straight out of Symon's playbook, no surprises, and this is a good thing. It's about meat here and I couldn't have been happier. The focus is definitely on burgers but you can get your encased meat fill and fried bologna fix, too. I was a bit disappointed to learn that they source their beef out of NJ (It is  organic, pasture raised, grass fed so points for that). Is there something wrong with Ohio cow? The meal:  The pickle bar - an interesting concept. Located against the wall behind the hostess station, it's stocked with a selection of pickled things - sweet spicy, garlic kosher dill, jalapenos, onions.  Chocolate milkshake - A tasty $5 shake. Good? Yes. Badass? Meh. Large enough to share served in the metal mixing cup. Not sickeningly sweet, nice and thick with a big straw. Could have used some more chocolate flavor for my taste.  Bacon cheeseburger - Cooked perfectly and seasoned just the same. Crispy, thick-cut bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce and a brioche bun. A perfect size.  The Lola - My wife loves the burger/egg combo and I can't blame her. A classic combo this one also featured some pickled red onions. Once again, cooked perfectly to my wife's specification with the same attention to detail shown with mine. I love watching the egg burst its yolk down the sides of the burger.  Lola fries - I don't think these would be worth $4 but since it was happy hour they were only a buck. Tasty, crispy shoestring version with rosemary. I didn't care for the serving vessel as it made it difficult to eat them without getting them all over the table. Might wanna rethink this one.  Our experience at B Spot was a good one. You can't beat the happy hour specials (we got out the door for less than $30 with tip) and the kitchen knows their way around a burger, actually nailing the cooking temps. There were a couple of shortcomings for us with the service and logistics but they were pretty minor."}
{"text":"B Spot is a bar/restaurant in a suburban shopping mall. This is not at all what I was expecting. Some of the tables were in the hallway of the mall! Very lame.  It's hard to go into a Michael Symon restaurant without high expectations, especially after I'd kept seeing this place hyped on Twitter and by people I know in the area. B Spot didn't live up to those expectations.  Honestly, the whole concept of B Spot confuses me. Gourmet hamburgers? Burgers are one of the few foods even I can make decently well on a charcoal grill in the back yard. I'd expect an iron chef burger to be unbelievably amazing, especially since they're 8-10 bucks a pop (and don't come with fries, chips or anything).   I ordered the Yo! which was much less spicy than the menu would lead you to believe. Other burgers ordered by my group included a Shroomage and Thin Lizzy. Everyone agreed that the burgers were good. We each got a side of Lola fries (for an extra 3 bucks a pop) that really left a lot to be desired. They are thin fries and hardly the best I've ever had.  Part of me thinks 3/5 is being generous. I probably won't ever go back to B Spot, but I might, given the circumstances, recommend this to some people."}
{"text":"Had the special of the month burger called the gladiator. Was decent burger but not something that blew my mind. The Lola fries is good and the beer they have on tap is great. Haven't tried their fries though"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.   The sandwiches are great, the fries amazing, the sauces addictive, and the pickle bar outrageous. And the beer selection is vast."}
{"text":"Through a combination of gourmet burger meat, interesting and tasteful additions to the burger stack, & reputation of 'The Iron Chef' of CLE, this place pulls off some nice burgers. One look at the menu, tells you their burgers are the highlights. There are a very few non-burger items on the menu. The ambiance is akin to a down home burger joint with hint of sophistication. The service is attentive & the wait staff work hard to impress customers.   There are several aspects that don't quite fit this restaurant. The down home ambiance & rustic fashioned menu don't go with digital pad totting staff & their modernized uniforms. Being attached to 'The Eaton Place' which tries to exude a sense of luxury, doesn't fit the overall interpretive motto of B Spot  - come for eclectic gourmet affordable burgers in a family friendly down home setting  This said, the star attractions - the Burgers - pull of only decently. The taste is good but nothing that will make you convert. The price is affordable & in sync with the quality."}
{"text":"B Spot Westlake is consistent in quality & service as that of the East side location. The ambiance is that of casual affair with airy feel, the bar is well stocked with a large variety on tap along with imported beer. The wait staff take your order on their electronic pad as well as process your payment table side on the same handhelds. The Westlake location has a wide outdoor seating that open out from the inside. One can sit at one of the tables located at the threshold that feel like you are sitting outside while still being covered above head fully.   I have always loved Lola fries even from the days when there was only one Lola in Tremont. Thus whenever I visit any of Chef Sympn's restaurants, these fries are a must have.  These thin cut crispy fries sprinkled with sea salt can be had by the dozens.  My latest visit at this B Spot, made me get well acquainted with a Brueben ( burger with corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss, Russian dressing ) paired with Hopback Amber Ale. This combination was great. The burger was finger licking good and the Ale actually enhanced the taste of the corned beef-sauerkraut-sirloin burger combination.  The combination of the ingredients of this burger was quite tasty and packed a flavorful punch. Don't let the combination of items written on the menu intimidate you. In many of the variety of  the burgers I've had at B Spot, the taste does not equate to what you think the combination might taste by simply looking at the menu. The taste is not a simple addition of the individual taste of the items rather the taste is an interesting tasty transformed flavor.   Despite the flavor & innovative combination of flavors of these burgers, I feel the price range from $6 to $11 is bit steep to the portion and taste ratio. I also found the wait staff to be in-attentive not just to my table but all others. I visited at 3pm on a Saturday which woulld be the down time before dinner crowd. I can only imagine the quality of service during busy hours. The wait staff seemed very territorial, the staff from other tables would not assist at my table & we could deal with only our wait staff even when there was an accidental spill of my drink. Despite other ai staff walking by my table seeing the spill, I ad to aw close to 5 min before my able staff came round to help.  I like Michael Symon's take on food at all his restaurants & I hope to be back. I just hope B Spot doesn't fall victim to the mediocrity of chain restaurants."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Went on a weekday the place was not at all full, with plenty of open tables. We were seated right away but that's as much as I can say. Our food took over 30minutes to arrive. The waiter never even acknowledged the fact it was taking so long. When we called him over to ask about delay he made excuses about being short staffed and large parties. If that's the case they should let customers know at the door that even though there are open tables they can't handle the volume. Anyway, once our expensive burgers arrived, more disappointment!  The burgers were just mediocre. Not at all worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for my birthday. So good. Excellent burgers and the Lola fries are to die for. Also, the chocolate banana marshmallow shake is delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I would not be proud to have my name on this place.  13$ for a salad- six mushrooms, scattering of goat cheese and a bag of arugula 15$ for another salad- a head of iceberg lettuce, 6 cherry tomatoes, 6 slices of cucumber and a hockey puck of a turkey burger....  It seems that unless you don't have any preference in meat flavor and like everything fried you won't like this place.  BOO."}
{"text":"You had me at pickle bar! Stumbled upon this place while visiting Cleveland. Located  in between a Starbucks and a famous footwear this gem has semi outdoor seating with large open garage doors. The burgers are phenomenal, inventive toppings and never frozen patties. The burgers are cooked to order and fully customizable. The Rosemary fries crisp and light even though they're cooked in lard #yum  Sara was all around awesome, and thanks for splitting my marshmallow topped milkshake :)  I will definitely be back, we need more pickle bars on buffalo!"}
{"text":"Have you ever hit the Spot? I mean, the Spot? That spot that makes you moan with pleasure, causes your heart to skip a beat, raises your blood pressure, over works your salivary glands, decreases your I.Q. and releases sticky, tasty juices that run all over your fingers and lips? Of course you haven't. That was a stupid question. Forget about it. Because if you had, you'd be doing it right now!  But let's get serious for a moment. Like Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, those famous explorer with a taste for wild adventures and indian maidens, some of us have set out on journeys in search of the elusive spot without the luxury of previous experience, guidance from our friends or parent (because they never found it either), nor any idea from Garmin of how to get to where we are going. Wherever that may be. You understand, don't you? It is quite difficult to define that which has only been found by a handful of over achievers who, up until recently, have kept the secret of the spot all to themselves.   So zip up that droopy frown because there is still hope for us laypeople to whom the gods have yet to bestow the gift of discovery (yeah, we'll call it that). There are, in fact, a few that have come before us who are more than willing to share their wisdom and experience with those less fortunate than themselves. One particular bald member of this exclusive society is a talented and well known meat slinger by the name of Michael Symon.  Michael's legendary meat prowess is available to everyone with a few bucks to toss around in one of his B Spot burger restaurants. With numerous locations from which to choose, Michael makes it easy to find one of his spots. I chose the Strongsville, Ohio location for its proximity to mine and asked for the Red Hot Burger special.  The Red Hot burger, although a view at the right angle and light makes it appear other worldly (like food from Uranus), it is indeed quite flavorful and packs just enough of a kick. The soft brioche bun was well toasted but the bottom became soggy quickly with all of the juices that ran out when I gave the burger a gentle squeeze. That, unfortunately, left me having to use a knife and fork to finish. The barbecued pork atop the burger gave some nice acidity and was a Carolina style accompaniment. The burger patty was surprisingly tender and cooked a perfect medium (as I requested) with a bit of salt and pepper. With the addition of jalapeños and a layer of melted jack cheese, the flavors climax in your mouth and will keep you coming back for more!   The Lola fries were crispy and tender while the Lola ketchup, which tasted of ancho chili and cumin, paired well with them. Unfortunately, the onion rings left much to be desired and did not appear to have been hand breaded. If, in fact, they were of the frozen variety, I find it an unacceptable alternative in both class and flavor.   Overall, the flavors at this B Spot were spot-on (sorry) and far above the average burger joint. The speed at which my meal was served after I ordered was impressive, even by the standards of a thirteen-year-old boy with his father's bedside magazines.  The meal was enjoyable and I do believe the praises thus far received by Michael Symon are well deserved and likely to continue. After having had this experience and having been shown the way to a burger should be, I now frequently have dreams of that wet, juicy goodness oozing around my finger and I find myself with a strange longing for another shot at the B Spot.  http://foodie-pebbles.blogspot.com/2014/12/michael-symons-b-spot-strongsville-oh.html"}
{"text":"I'd heard talk of this place before I even left for Cleveland. Everybody said it was a must visit. So I did. Very happy with my decision, and everyone's recommendation. The decor is very unique, and original. The beer list is very extensive (I tried one of the local brews called a portside south \"216\". Very hoppy, which makes me happy). While you'd think with burger in the name of the establishment, that's all they'd have, you'd be wrong. From salads, to burgers, to brats so many choices. I had the fat doug burger, SO GOOD! Their fries are no joke either, and no trip there is complete without a BADASS milkshake! Do yourself a favor, and order the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon with Bourbon, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Yo! The service is what really made this place worthwhile, as Katie at the bar was ever so gracious and hospitable. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Coming from a guy that's not a big gourmet burger fan, these folks make a damn good burger.  I've only frequented them once but 'frequent' might become the word-o-the-day for me.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll do it again.  I had the spicy jalapeno concoction and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, and really enjoyed myself.  The restaurant was not packed; we were seated right away.  The burgers are a tad on the small size, but the flavor is well worth it!  I ordered a basic cheese burger, but it was one of the best burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I've had but pretty close. Had the bacon cheeseburger and fries. The pickle bar is a nice touch and the atmosphere is that of a sports bar. Service was good, food didn't take forever, and I'd definitely try it again. Don't be shy check it out when you're in the mood for a good burger. Nice job Chef Symon"}
{"text":"Totally worth the hype. Plain Jane burger was perfect. The meat was so amazing and the perfect texture of bun to go with it. It took a bit to get used to the rosemary fries but after banning the ketchup they were amazing. The strawberry shake was sinful. I left in a very good mood!"}
{"text":"We usually enjoy our time here, but the fact that we waited over an hour after we called ahead and the restaurant wasn't busy. Bummer. The hostess did a pour job. If she would have sat accordingly she would have maximized service.  Instead she made horrible seating choices leaving a good amount of people waiting. When I called ahead she said there is no wait and we would be seated right away. Nope. We waited so long, just looking at empty tables all over the restaurant.  When we were finally seated our server was horrible. He was short and slammed our drinks on the table repeatedly. It was horrific and actually turned us off from ordering anything else."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the ratings here.  We were visiting friends in shaker heights and wanted to try Michael Symon's burger joint.  We split the seasonal shake (s'mores) between five and onion rings and Lola fries for the table.  It's been a long time since I had a milkshake and it was worth the wait.  My husband and I split a cheeseburger with pepper jack and ordered it medium rare.  I would call it rare, and fortunately we're not opposed to undercooking a burger.  It was so good.  They have a great condiment bar, and be sure to taste the hot sweet pickles!"}
{"text":"I've had a mantra throughout my life about eating, specifically eating dessert, that I've tended to live by: \"I'll pass on the sweet stuff and grab another helping of meat and potatoes\".  B Spot, although it's known for it's Burgers, is one of the few places that has made me rethink that.  Here's why: Vanilla Bean Apple Pie BACON milkshake.  This, my friends, was undoubtedly the BEST milkshake I've ever tasted--creamy and delicious and loaded with crunchy little nuggets of bacon.  It was a combo that I never could have dreamed, but one which will haunt my dreams on the best of nights.  Aside from the dreamy milkshake, the rest of the place was solid. Several previous reviews commented on the burgers being \"less done\" from what they expected.  I would have to agree, and even though I tend to prefer my premium beef on the rare side, my \"medium\" burger was a bit too red and bit too cool for my taste.  I'd definitely recommend the medium-well.  The taste of the burger itself was fantastic, although the bun tended to fall apart and I couldn't really taste the chorizo that was on it.  Also, the fries were good, but weren't as amazing as the hype that I read--definitely wished I would have ordered the Tomato Blue Cheese soup instead.    Overall, this is a REALLY good place--I especially love the \"garage door\" front to give it an open air feel.  Anxious to go back and get myself another solid burger!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for their solid burgers. It's a little out of the way for me, and it's not a place where I'd make a special trip for. But if I'm in the area, I'd definitely consider stopping by. The burgers themselves are good, well-cooked, and with fun toppings and sauces. They're not the biggest burgers, but they are satisfying. The fries are also good (I mean, they're fries), but I didn't find the Lola fries to be anything special, and I thought it was a little hard to taste the rosemary. They also have a pickle bar, if that's your thing (they're not mine, so can't really comment on it)  Overall, I expected a little more from a Michael Symon restaurant, but it definitely provides some good food overall. You can't really go wrong with burgers, fries, onion rings, and milkshakes."}
{"text":"I still love this place and my boy Symon but please bring back the chip fondue...that was the best thing eva. I almost cried when I went and you didn't have it anymore. :("}
{"text":"Food Network has over the years eliminated interesting, talented chefs promoting folksy females and pretentious males. Somehow Michael Symon jumped over the fence of privilege. Even if his fellow food networkers were not so repellent Michael would still shine with his affability. He and Drew Carey have done more to bring Cleveland a positive light than any basketball player. It is no wonder that when a friend was passing thru town he wanted to eat at B Spot. So I obliged.  My previous review critiqued the B Spot concept more than the food. On this visit I had the thin Lizzie. I liked it very much except that after a few bites the bottom bun became so soggy I could not put it down for fear it would break apart. Most seem to love the Lola fries. I found them potato sticks striving to be McDonald's fries. None of the sauces was good enough that I would want the recipe or purchase a bottle. The pickle bar could have come from my refrig.   I have no idea who decorated this burger joint but she certainly will not be in great demand. In the late afternoon, diners ranged from children with at home mothers, retirees, and youngish couples all being served by an attentive and polite young staff. Hospitality is not only a Southern thing. In the background music played that was not particularly suited to any demographic there. Go for the burgers and the service.  As my friend said when we left, not bad, but Michael can do better."}
{"text":"Where to begin...the genius \"pickle bar\", siracha wings, housemade ketchup or the perfectly portioned burgers. Do you really need a 1lb burger anyway?  I've dined here three times on various visits to Cleveland and have always had excellent food along with efficient and friendly service from the staff. Congrats to the Chef...Symon?  ;-)"}
{"text":"Great lunch - had the blue cheese bacon salad yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to b-spot at various locations and it's always pretty good. Most recently my boyfriend tried the impossible burger on the thin lizzy which was delicious. If you didn't tell me it was a vegetarian burger I would have no idea! It was tender, flavorful, juicy, and even had a pink color in the middle like a real beef burger! I ordered a burger that was on special that had prosciutto, greens, and red wine vinegarette. It was good but very firm, fairly dry, and lacking flavor. The fries and onion rings were delicious though! The pickle bar is always fun, the kimchee is my favorite. They have a great selection of beer and wine, none of the cocktails sounded very good to me though and are fairly pricey. The atmosphere is really nice and trendy and the staff was welcoming and accommodating. In the past I've tried the pulled pork sandwich and one of the bratwursts and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Its about time! Strongsville needs good restaurants so bad! It is a franchise black hole and places like B Spot really make this little city a foodie haven. So on to the review!   Let me start by saying that I have never been to the other B Spots. So everything I experienced last night was new to me. And it was awesome. We got a seat at the bar because of the hour wait! It looks like the Strognsvillians are just as excited as i that we now have a few good places to eat! As we waited we ordered some of their crazy drinks, for example a bacon infused Old Fashioned! YUM Booze and bacon what could be better?! We were tempted to get one of their Bad *ss shakes but had to turn it down ...this time.    For entrées we ordered a Brueban burger and the Chick Magnet. The burger was a little rare but hey, I am a carnivore and that was no problem. The burger it self was great but the coffee BBQ sauce made this a damn good burger. The chicken sandwich was great and had fresh avocados on it, it went well with their spicy mustard too. We ordered a side of their chips and fondue, and they were awesome!   The service was good and bartenders entertaining.  The hour wait is more like 5 minutes if you just go straight to the bar. I will definitely be back here. They have a great beer selection too. And who doesn't like beer?!"}
{"text":"Our burgers were cooked to perfection, savory, juicy and well seasoned. Loved all the fun sauces to choose from - Sha Sha (sweet heat) is a standout. The apple pie and bacon shake - sweet, salty, crunchy, smooth - is hands down the most creative and flavorful shake we've ever had. We will be craving B Spot. Great service."}
{"text":"First time at this B Spot location. We are fans of Symon's ground meat blend. Our burgers are always cooked and seasond perectly. The apple pie and bacon shake is a favorite. Great service."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for work with one of my reps and wanted to hit up some place casual but not a chain.  Found B Spot and read that it was Michael Symon's burger place.  So ignoring the fact that I find him annoying on the Chew, we went to B Spot. While it wasn't anything spectacular, they made a good burger.  The restaurant looks good inside with \"factory\" motorcycle parts ont he ceiling and a neat bottle cap \"B\" mosaic. Draught beer selection is a bit lacking though.  I went for the Bacon Cheeseburger. The main thing I liked was the size. It was perfect. Most of these other \"high end\" burger places try to impress you with the size of the burger with the taste falling flat. B Spots burgers were perfectly size and tasty. The order of fires could easily have served 3 people so they were a bit much. But overall a good burger.   Lots of chefs have opened up burger joints to hit a lower price category. Some do it well while others miss the mark. B Spot does a much better job than Bobby's Burger Palace. But these places still don't come close lots of places in Milwaukee. They know how to do burgers there."}
{"text":"We've since given B Spot a few more chances and have become a real fan -- still not a milkshake fan, but I have really, really enjoyed every burger I've tried.  Lola fries are great too.  I haven't strayed from the burger menu yet; they're just too good to try anything else yet.  Happy Hour is a big plus for a family of 4."}
{"text":"Meh. Nice place inside but everything concerning the food is just meh. Nothing terrible but also nothing really good, and at these prices it should be."}
{"text":"When I heard that Michael Symon owned a burger joint, I knew that a visit was mandatory. Michael Symon is considered by many to be the savior of the Cleveland food scene. Just read the reviews of his other restaurants, Lola and Lolita, to understand what I'm talking about. Basically this guy is culinary gold. And with this in mind, my wife and I took a casual date night to B Spot.   It seems that people have pretty mixed reviews about this place - for good reason too. Let's start off with the good. The burgers are pretty dang yummy - definitely better than most middle of the road burger places. The flavors are unique and it is clear that they take pride in preparing the meat exactly like you want it. Our burgers were spot on. I got the Lola burger and my egg was done to perfection. I was also really impressed by our server. I know that other reviews have complained about lack of attention and the fact that their tablets got in the way of eye contact but our server (Nicolette) was fantastic. The manager also made the effort to go to every single table and ask how their service was - which tells me they are at least trying to improve their customer experience. The fries were an ample portion (the wifey and I should have only got one order to share) and very tasty.  Unfortunately there are also a few negatives to balance out the positives. First and foremost, if you chose to dine outside of happy hour times, I personally think the food is overpriced. That's not to say it isn't good - just too expensive for what you get. During happy hour, however, the food is very cheap and can easily fit into the budget of a family eating out as long as you don't deviate outside of the discounted items (shakes are still $5 or so... which is the same amount as your meal). I also thought the layout and ambiance of the restaurant were odd. It wasn't comfortable and warm and at the same time failed to be really hip and trendy. It felt like I was sitting in the middle of an identity crisis. And I know this is silly but the name 'B Spot' drives me up the wall. It may be one of the dumbest restaurant names I've ever heard. But this is a minor annoyance if the food is up to par - which it seemed to be.  Overall, I'd highly recommend B Spot to anyone who is willing to eat Monday through Friday between the hours of 4-6 pm. The price is right and the food is great. However, outside of those hours, I'm not sure the price is justifiable."}
{"text":"We went here last night, and I wish I could say I LOVE everything Symon does but B Spot is a let down; not only is it underwhelming, the menu seems fairly small and pricey for the food that you actually get :(. Sadly, I'm pretty sure the kimchi at the pickle bar was my favorite thing here. The service was decent and the burgers were alright; but a $7 side of mediocre onion rings and $4 for fries that can only be described as \"eh\" leave me wondering why we didn't just go to wendy's. I understand the concept of this place, but the execution. . .is lacking.   Is exceptionally average a thing?"}
{"text":"I've ate here about 5 times now, it's about a 2.5 hour drive from where I live, and they always have had pretty good burgers. Love the porky fries, they are my favorite part of coming, and the porky burger is also great. I'll be back for sure, but it's a every 4 months or so make a trip to go thing, more than that and it loses it's uniqueness."}
{"text":"It was good but could have been better. I really like the flavor combo of the burger but one of my biggest pet peeves is when the burger doesn't fit on the bun and you're left with all the other ingredients, that's this place. Shoestring fries, LOTS of them...if you go during happy hour you get them for only a buck! If you have room left over go for a vanilla apple pie shake....with bourbon YES!!!"}
{"text":"The past few times I've come to B Spot there has been an issue but today took the cake. Their POS system went down which i understand happens, however we weren't told when we arrived and were sat anyway. We sat for about 10 mins before the manager came over to drop off waters and had NO idea what she was talking about in regards to beers. She said she'd be right back to take our order. 10 mins later our server arrives to take the order, still not mentioning the server error. Come to find out from our server telling another table their system is down and they're not able to make any orders. Would've been nice to know! Our beers were never delivered once we ordered them, our food arrives but no water refills during the entire ordeal. Our server also never came over to check on us. Burger was greasy. Ordered medium came out well done"}
{"text":"I't s a Michael Symon place and I am in Cleveland ... OF COURSE I CHECKED THIS PLACE OUT.    Good, not great, beer selection, but who cares; the food is why you came here and burger was perfectly cooked and very, very good.  Ordered the special burger that game with two pork rinds and roast pork with barbeque sauce and YUM.  Lola Fries are yum and the onion rings were delicious.  Wish i had gotten the rootbeer float instead of the beer, but there's a next time right?"}
{"text":"B spot is a good place to eat, just not the one in Strongsville, the food was horrible and you couldnt tell your server untill she felt she was ready to bring you the bill. Never again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a lunch or early dinner and the place isnt crowded, then give it a try.  The food is good, but not worth standing in line for.  Unlike other reviewers, I didnt find the servers to be snobby.    The flavors are unique, but not that unique, and you can find great burgers at many places."}
{"text":"B Spot is one of my favorite burger places not just in Cleveland but EVER. I have never had a bad experience while visiting ANY of the locations. Great drinks, amazing shakes and the best burgers/fries/onion rings!"}
{"text":"I looovvee their impossible burger. I don't eat meat anymore but this is the closest I have had to the real thing. The pickle bar adds a nice touch to the burger as well. The service was good we did not wait long for our food. I will definitely recommend B-Spot to any vegetarian craving a burger."}
{"text":"Had a great time at B Spot this weekend, went with a party of 4 around 3pm and got seated right away on the outdoor patio, the weather was a little overcast so we were a bit concerned about rain but carried on.  Our waitress was nice and got our orders right but seemed a bit flustered, maybe it was because she was at the end of her shift? She left about halfway through our meal but let us know who would be taking over for her, which we thought was nice.  Now on to the food! I tried the Lola burger, which was a bit cooked over the medium I requested but still tasted very good and you could tell each ingredient was of good quality. We also shared an order of onion rings, which was huge and tasted very good as well.   The highlight for me was the Chocolate Marshmallow Banana Shake, the marshmallows are toasted on top of the shake and they serve it in the metal mixing cup so you get your full, huge portion. The chocolate was of excellent quality and was a well balanced delicious drink.   We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here, the pickle bar is another cool feature that added to our enjoyment and thankfully we were all just about done eating when the rain hit.  A roll out canopy would do them wonders in the outdoor seating area!"}
{"text":"from the original decor to the unique menu items, you can't go wrong here! The Vanilla Apple Bacon shake, and porky fries are a must!  A bit on the pricey side, be prepared to spend about $20 or so per person."}
{"text":"As I only come in town a few times a year, my meals in town are limited and always want to make the most of my time and appetite. There are a few places I must have while in town (i.e. Lopez), but I sacrificed those to try B-Spot for dinner Thursday night. My expectations were very high, given Michael Symon's previous ventures and overall reputation, unfortunately my experience came up short.   First off, I don't understand why they can't bring out the appetizers first. We were starving, but had to wait for all our food to come out together before we could dig in (to be fair, the food did come out promptly). Despite not having to wait for all our food to come out, it was annoying that I felt rushed to eat the appetizer (wings and soup) before my entree cooled off.   The food was subpar. The wings were fried well, but the parmesan and garlic seasoning was lacking in flavor and was really too buttery for my liking. The bleu cheese and tomato soup was nothing special either (ditto for the fries). As for my entree, I got the yo! burger, which sounded phenomenal on paper, but came out way too dry (I asked for medium well, and it came out very well done). It did have a nice bun, but paying ~$9 for a burger, I expect a burger of more substantial size. Another member of my party got the pulled pork sandwich, which was good but the bun couldn't hold the juiciness of the pork and quickly fell apart.   To be fair though, they had a phenomenal beer list (although the waiter wasn't well versed in the offerings when I asked for a recommendation, but he might not have been of drinking age either so I can't fault too hard for that) and the pickle bar was a nice addition to the meal."}
{"text":"A limited menu, but quality all the same.  The sandwiches are what sandwiches should be.   The rosemary fries are excellent; be sure to try them with Shasha sauce.   If you're looking for a spot for a quick \"B\", this is it."}
{"text":"I had the luxury of making my own burger so to speak \"Flying Pig\" Crispy chicken with pulled pork and bacon and some cheese to hold it all together. They did an awesome job. The onion rings with Sasha Sauce were tasty and the lola fries are not to be missed. I know it's a celeb chef but this is love of something easy and accessible at an affordable price point...Beer you say nice list of on drafts! Service friendly and conscientious. Will I be back you ask...ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"Michael Symon is a bit of a local celebrity.  He is in charge of Lola and Lolita, which cater to the culinary needs of people in Downtown Cleveland and the surrounding areas.  However, for people who aren't willing to drive into Downtown, he has the B Spot for burgers, beer, and bologna.  Their burgers have won national awards, according to the waitress.  Burger names are just as exotic as the ingredients.  The burger I got was simply called \"Yo!\" (yes, the exclamation mark was part of  the name).  It had banana peppers, colla, salami, a \"hot\" spread that wasn't really that hot, and - obviously - a burger.  The burger itself was on the small and expensive side, and sides are extra.  If you don't mind dying and going to heaven, get the onion rings.  That was not a figure of speech.   I really wanted to give this place a fifth star, but I found some flaws. The waitresses seemed as devoted to socializing with other employees as they were about doing a good job at their job(s), which is both good and bad.  I always thought good servers got to know their customers in the same way a stripper gets to know hers before a VIP dance.  That did not happen with me.  The full bar made me very happy, though.  It would be a good place to meet up for a Yelp Elite meeting or something *hint hint*.  For a burger joint, the bar is large like Rosie O'Donnell's waistline.  Yes, that was a fat joke.  I didn't have any major problems since I'm not that picky and I was by myself, so I can't comment on the poor customer service that others received.  Burgers here are among the best I've ever had - it's getting really hard to rank burger joints now - but the overall experience could be hindered by poor customer service or Nickelback on the satellite radio."}
{"text":"This place serves up a smokin' burger! I love the seating inside and out! The drinks are also great for happy hour and the service is always friendly and fast. Also the milkshakes are SOOOOOO GOOD! If you are around Eaton and a place to grab a bite this is a safe bet that won't break the bank either!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this rating and review even though most of you have probably already been here. the pickle bar is great and it even has kimchi which i love.   the star for me and the reason i finally visited is because they now carry the impossible burger. for you meat eaters you won't care...lol But my vegetarians this is the only burger i have ever had that tasted like meat. so much so that my brain almost would not let me chew...lol  If you haven't eaten meat in some time it will be hard but it is absolutely delicious and worth a trip. the margarita martini is also so bomb."}
{"text":"Typical bar food and setting. The turkey burger was good but I wish they had better fries. The best part of the experience was that they will send you a text to let you know your table is ready. This allows for you to go window shopping at area stores or in the mall."}
{"text":"Hi All,  So I was told by the locals, this is a greatest burger place.  We went with a group of 11 and they did take a reservation.  Best burger??? Not even close to  Plan B on Hartford, Ct, but it was decent.  Too pricey for the size, but was  above average quality.    Now the onion rings were awesome.  some of the best I have ever has.  And a very diverse and interesting beer selection.  Overall...very good place...not great... Maybe the best burger in town...but that stops at the border.  MSZ"}
{"text":"We came here about two weeks ago. It was around lunch time and we were greeted and sat promptly. Our server came over right after we were seated and took our drink order. Came back and asked if we needed a minute. We did. Came back, (very quickly), we still needed that minute.. I believe came back twice more and then we were ready. Our orders came out just as we had ordered and the burgers were very good. However the fries (skinny seasoned) fries were terrible. From experience as a GM for a restaurant the knowledge of knowing the smaller skinny fries are more cost effective..they are comparable to the French fries served at a Steak & Shake...double the price.   The service: As attentive as our waitress was, she just kept coming back over and over without giving us enough time to sit and actually enjoy the meal. I'd understand this if it was a dinner rush, and though it was during lunch hours, the restaurant wasn't overloaded with full tables.   I can't say I won't be back since I frequent Crocker park often, however this may not be my first choice next time as it was this past time.   -Britany"}
{"text":"First and last visit yesterday. Michael should and would be ashamed of how his business is being run. To start, there was for what ever reason a 1 and 1/2 wait, why? For a burger? None of the pagers were being handled out however your name and phone number were put on a scrap piece of paper- for a phone call that never came,however my name was marked off the list. I was told that she called and left me a VM. Well I was expecting a call from them so I of course was prepared with ringer on high etc. So when No call, I returned and she said with an attidude that she called me and left me a VM,ahh! No!, you didn't!!! She told me it would be an additional 15 min. where I was so upset! Are you kidding?, I saw empty tables!!! At this point I'm ready to leave, but my wife made me stay since we've waited this long, so we reluctently stayed.A few minutes later the same girl came to me and said a table was being cleaned, wet I might add, Dry the tables!!!  So after 1 hr 45 min. we were seated. We ordered the Loya and a veggie burger,onion rings , fries and a high priced  choc. milk shake. I expected to be wowed by all this since after such a wait the food MUST  be fantastic. .right?  .Well the milk shake was good, the Loya burger was nothing to write about, kinda blah, the onion rings were over cooked by a bit, and the rosemary fries were flavorless and cold and couldn't taste any rosemary on them at all. The worst thing was their sad attempt to please the non-meat eaters with a soggy, char grilled flavored veggie burger- oh it was the worst I've ever tasted- Nasty!!!,so,so sad for a Iron Chef to put his name on that ...I'm no Iron Chef buy I can a better one, sorry:( .We expected so much more, but we were very disappionted, we will NEVER come back.    The only thing that made the 40 min. drive o.k. was the time spent waiting being spent at Trader Joes and Barnes and Noble. One last point was the staff of many,in  which it was so hard to tell the staff from who the manager might be. I would  have liked to tell the manager all my disapointments. We found out at the bill, the manager  was aware of our long wait and was adjusting the bill,which took off  the fries ,1 shake,\"I bought 2\"@ 5.99, and the onion rings however made no attempt to come over herself to apologize. If you want a decent mike shake for $6 and want to wait as long or longer than a ride at Disneyland, by all means enjoy!!   All around I only gave it a 1 star rating because I like Micheal. I'm sure he has lost sight of whats going on at his low end burger places-but I'm sure if he had the the same experience we did, he wouldn't \"B spot\", happy."}
{"text":"I've had multiple visits to this location, and multiple trips to other B-spots. I have to say that this one is my favorite in terms of service and consistency of food. They've been able to hit a perfect medium-rare with every visit.    The staff is really friendly and outgoing.  They're really good at working the line between \"not attentive enough\" and \"just sit down and join the conversation.\"  Always pleasant and helpful.    And, they don't forget the cupcake for the kids meal.   Head to B Spot before or after tearing the mall up!"}
{"text":"This is the second B Spot location I've visited.  I took my dad for a Father's day lunch, (a day early, but whatever.)   The food was good, the server was nice, but there was obviously a disconnect between the waitstaff and the kitchen. I ordered a milkshake and waited over 15 minutes to get it. I tried to get someone's attention, but everyone was hanging out by the window. Mind you, The restaurant wasn't slammed. There were plenty of empty tables considering it was shortly after opening.   Another pet peeve: we ordered a kid's meal and didn't get the cupcake. Not a huge deal, but how would you like to have a 3 year old ask you \"Where's my cupcake?\" for the rest of the afternoon?   Short version: Tasty food consistent with B Spot's other locations. Slow service without attention to diners. It's the B Spot to visit if you're not in a hurry or are supremely patient."}
{"text":"Heaven forbid I blaspheme in the House of Symon but here it is: B Spot was just ok and I don't plan to go back. Why for? I'll tell you:  Service was friendly but a bit cool. For a beer list that extensive and upon inquiry to be greeted with, \"Oh...I *never* drink beer\" by the bartender... come on. She gave me samples but that's so tedious. At least be able to BS your way through the beer questions. If I'm asking beer questions you're a bartender first, server second.  My cheeseburger was the size of my palm (not including the fingers) and was a la carte, for $7. It was decent as burgers go but nothing to write a five star review about. I asked for a side salad which was a small diner bowl of finely-chopped hearts of romaine, three tiny half cherry tomatoes and some thin cucumber slices tossed in lemon vinaigrette for $6. It wasn't until there was time to let my eyes wander that I saw it. A rule sheet. For a casual restaurant.   It is basically a list of do-nots and judgments that Symon and crew put upon their patrons. No coursing because they want the kitchen to run smoothly (what restaurant in the world, let alone one run by a star chef, blames coursing on screwing up the kitchen?), no adding ingredients though taking away is allowed (this is typically ok but you're a freaking burger joint. Sometimes people want grilled onions), no \"whining\" about how long it takes to sit down, no name-dropping (ok, fair enough, I hated it when people did that), no expecting your burger done any other way than what you tell them (kitchen: absolved and heaven forbid that's well done), but finally, have a great time!  Have we come into a time in the world when restaurants can be so cheeky and in love with themselves that patrons are given a list of commands before even ordering their food? In a five-star restaurant, maybe. In a burger and beer joint? Wow. Balls.  If I loved the burger, I don't think I'd go back simply because of the attitude. It's tacky, diners, whether you realize it or not, and you shouldn't be spoken down to because you're the one spending the money and you're the livelihood. That doesn't mean you're always right but it DEFINITELY doesn't mean you're always wrong."}
{"text":"Stars: 3   Pros:  The shroomage burger is good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Portebello is thick and very delicious. Onion rings are just average. The outside dining area is amazing.  Has different sauces (coffee ketchup, balsamic steak sauce, etc). Quite good.  I hear the shakes (the one with apple and bacon?) is delicious.   Cons: B-spot does not allow you to custom-add to your burger (I asked the waiter if they could add an egg to my burger) Why? A little insert on your table says something to the point that the ingredients for every burger on the menu is carefully thought out...blah blah blah. Going with that logic, it is interesting, therefore, that you can take stuff away, but you can't add stuff in.  Group gratuity is automatic 20%. Thats right. 20% for a burger joint that has a \"help-yourself-to-extra-condiments\" stand. -_- i thought they wouldn't let you add stuff to your burger...  All burgers are a bit on the smaller side compared to that of other restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great atmosphere, attentive wait staff.   Ordered the Lola Burger and I keep dreaming of it so I must return soon. Also got a custom alcohol milkshake (vanilla bean and apple pie with bourbon), that alone was one of the best mixtures I've ever had.  We arrived during lunch on a Monday and was immediately seated. After arriving, the place was packed.   It was my husband and I and he ordered the Porky burger and he is also very happy.  We complimented our lunch with Lola fries and onion rings...perfect lunch (not to mention our daughters name is Lola)!  Definitely a laid back atmosphere with awesome burgers (better than many places that state the same claim) and great beverages. I only wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"Went to the B Spot yesterday.  The food was phenomenal.  I had the Lola burger.  The service on the other hand, not so much.  Our waitress sucked.  She walked past the table multiple times seeing our drinks were empty and never asked if we wanted refills.  After taking our empty plates away it was another ten minutes until we received our check."}
{"text":"This is a great spot! The burgers are cooked to perfection. I like having my red meat cooked rare and at most medium rare. The do a perfect job of cooking the meat.   The fries, and onion rings are addictive and the shakes are nice and thick. You can't alter the burgers in the menu but you can build your own of none of the options strike you.   They also have have a great beer selection. They have a couple rotating beers on tap, the rest are new every couple months I believe. They also have a great bourbon selection.   If you wanna grab a quick bite and drinks for happy hour, B Spot has great specials Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"For an \"Iron Chef\" restaurant I'd expect a lot better. The prices are okay (about $5 for anything on the menu) but I'd expect a place specializing in burgers to let you build your own burger, and to not bring in frozen beef from New York.   I especially dislike the restaurant aura of \"you're lucky we're serving you\" with the whole no special orders thing. No special orders? Fine, but you don't have to put up condescending signage about it all over your restaurant.  The service is generally poor, the atmosphere of raucuos middle class suburban white people is awful. Also, our server claimed this restaurant had the largest beer selection in Ohio, which is entirely untrue.   If you're going to eat frozen burgers you'd be better off going to 5 guys and avoiding the attitude. This place is for the kind of people who'd hang at Applebees. P.S. The best burgers in Cleveland are at The Greenhouse Tavern and they're made with local beef."}
{"text":"Its hard to say anything bad about a Michael Simon restaurant. Great atmosphere for drinks and burgers. thee slads are really good too i know its a bureger place but the salad was great and can be split between to people, and THEY HAVE A PEPPER BAR."}
{"text":"I'm amazed at the number of low reviews for this place - maybe I came on a good night. I had a burger with grilled onions and mushrooms. It was an above average burger for me. I loved the addition of pickled onions and pickled tomatoes. I thought the fries were fantastic. And to top it all off with a vanilla bean apple pie bacon shake with bourbon - yum! I thought the atmosphere was as good as it could be for being inside of a shopping center and thought the bar was large and cool. The service seemed to be flowing at a decent pace. The place is pricey, so I don't see it as a regular place to get a burger, especially since there are some tasty cheaper options around, but a fun place to occasionally hook up with a friend."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned? The vanilla bean milk shake with apple pie, bacon and bourbon was amazingly good. The burgers were cooked perfectly. The onion rings were delicious if a touch too greasy. The pickle bar was great. Didn't love the \"no courses\" thing, but the food was fast, fresh and well made. If only there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"Great food and milkshakes. B Spot is a must if you're looking for a twist on the classic burger."}
{"text":"The burgers are good (thin Lizzy). The fries are over priced (for portion size) skinny fries. Mr Porky was good but I'd have preferred a different style bun. But ultimately, my lower score has to do with the banana chocolate marshmallow shake which just didn't deliver.  It was rich, just flat. I kind of felt that way about everything. A very meh meal. Not regrettable. Just forgettable."}
{"text":"The ambience at this Eton Square location is so crappy that I'm guaranteed an overpriced, lousy meal every. single.time. From the uncomfortable metal and freezing cold chairs (and crate-like wooden booth spaces), to the harsh lighting that's sure to disorient you, to the odd location near an entry door that is continually opening and closing and bringing in a cold breeze, to the bizarre seating that's half in the restaurant and half in the mall, separated by a strange set of upcycled railings that have crosses on them (from a church?). Simply awful.  Combined with their overpriced and lackluster food I'm not sure why they still survive. My burger bun was overly Buttered - no, completely greasy, and stale, the hamburger was very small and did cover the bun and my onion rings were overdone and cold. That pickle bar is a health hazard/ omg don't go near that thing. Bad idea in this day an age of food borne illness. Yuck."}
{"text":"I had a bad feeling about this place, but my mother wanted to try it. Ordered 2 burgers medium rare to go. Hostess wrote \"pink\" in big letters. Got home 5 minutes later. Hockey pucks. Well done and burned. My mother is a diabetic and had no choice but to eat hers. I took mine back. Much credit goes to Mark the manager who met me in the parking lot with a refund and replacement order. Sorry to say, even when cooked properly, it still had no taste, Expensive \"crap\". Pickle bar items were so sour, they could not be eaten."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and fries!  I had a classic bacon cheddar beef burger with carmalized onion sooooo freaking good!  The fries cooked in lard with rosemary added OMG the best and the best chocolate espresso shake ever!  I wish we were going to be in Cleveland longer, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First thing you must know: if you want your burger medium order it rare. They cook on too hot a surface so it's always over cooked and the exterior is usually dry after all the grease runs off.   Second; if you sit at the bar this is how to deduce you have a clueless bartender: 1. \"Basil Hayden rocks\" gets a response of: you want ice with that? 2. No water. Ever.  3. Can I get cheese fries? No. You can order \"porky fries\" and we will put Pork on the side. Really? Can't we just call that cheese fries skip the pork? No.  4. Can I get water? Let me see.  5. Can I get the Lola burger but with  regular onions not pickled onions? No. You can build your own burger and use regular onions.  Ok can i build a Lola burger exactly the same way but with regular onions and not pickled? Yes. Ok.... 6. Do you have hand wipes? ( no words, just moves the paper towels in front of me)   Overall the menu hasn't changed in a year. Good concept with sub par execution.   If you learn one thing from this review : go down the street Cheesecake Factory has a better burger with less bs."}
{"text":"At home I'd never dare to make a burger this rare (pink/red/juicy!)  but once presented with one, it was great. It was delicious. I don't mind the no subs rule, as it makes it slightly easier to choose from all the  possibilities when there aren't so many combinations. OMG, it was good.   Lola fries were good, but portion size was pretty small. Loved trying all the different sauces on the table.  After dinner we went to the Barnes & Noble next door and discovered Michael Symon's cookbook with recipes for basically everything we'd just eaten. including the sauces and fries. Yay!  So now when my out of town friends visit, we can visit a Michael Symon joint  on the east side without having to go all the way downtown (this is the perfect place to take non-Clevelanders even if it's not perfect, Symon is at least semi-famous and deservedly so)."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is nice and the fries are awesome.  I love thin cut fries!! They have a cocktail that has orange vodka and wheat beer. Don't remember what's it's called but damn it was good. Also the pickle bar is nice touch.  We tried all of them."}
{"text":"Slightly over-rated. I was told these are the best burgers in town, but I'm not sure I would go that far. I also got food poisoning, however, I'm not factoring that into my rating, because since moving to Cleveland, I've had food poisoning a couple of times. There isn't as much oversight with restaurants in Cleveland as is in Los Angeles.   The pickle bar is fantastic and the milk shakes are great too. There is a high probability I will go back, but I'm not making any special trips."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at B Spot in the Eton Center while I was over on the East Side doing other things.  Despite the snow, B Spot was at a 20 minute wait for a table, although there was a lone stool at the bar where I could partake in the full menu.  I had the Shromage Burger, Lola Fries (the burgers don't come with any sides on their own), and the Tomato Blue Cheese Soup.  It took a while for the bartender to take my order, but after that, service was reasonably quick.  Unfortunately, while I thought that the soup would come out first, I got all three items at the same time, which I believe is a less-than-ideal serving.  The Shromage Burger was very good.  It was cooked right to my medium-well specification.  In addition to the portabella mushroom, blue cheese, and caramelized onions, what really made the burger was the Lola steak sauce.  The Lola Fries were also very good--thin cut and seasoned.  They kind of remind me of the Pomme Frites at db Bistro Moderne but without the stuff to dip the fries in (which could be an idea for the future).  The fries on their own, though, are already excellent. Finally, the Tomato Blue Cheese soup was decent, but nothing incredible.  Actually, I thought it was a little too cheesy--as if I were eating ravioli.  I know the place is upscale without trying to wholly appear so, but I could have done without the brown paper towel-like rolls for napkins.  They remind me a little too much of a paper towel dispenser you'd find in a men's room and...that doesn't really do wonders for the appetite.  (If they had fine linen in the bathroom--which I didn't check out--then maybe I'll give them a pass for irony.)  And there are those lights from The Publican again...  Fairly strong food-wise; a little lacking in other aspects of a good restaurant.  I'm struggling between 3 stars and 4 stars on this one.  I actually live on the farther West Side of Cleveland, so I ask myself would I drive out to B Spot just to get a meal?  No.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Dinner at the newly opened (second day) but long-awaited and highly anticipated B Spot at Crocker Park.  Like my visit to its sister location at the Eton Center, the wait was long (1 hour for a table), but I managed to snag a single stool at the bar.  I ordered a Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon Shake with Bourbon, a Lola Burger, and a side of Lola Fries.  While the wait for a table was long, there certainly was no hold-up at the kitchen:  My food came out in under 5 minutes from ordering.  The promptness was appreciated but did seem a little suspicious to me.  The Lola Burger was fantastic--particularly as the bacon, red onions, cheddar, and mayo get encapsulated in the yolk from the fried egg sitting atop the thick patty.  It is a messy experience, so be sure to have a couple paper towel napkins at the ready.  The Lola Fries were very good as usual, and there are available accompaniments of Ketchup, Lola Ketchup (ketchup with a little more vinegar and spice to it--I wasn't particularly a fan), Stadium Mustard, Coffee BBQ Sauce, Balsamic Steak Sauce, and Shasha Sauce.  (I have no idea what the last three sauces are about.)  Having already been to the East Side location, the quality of the burger and fries were not really all that surprising.  I was surprised, however, by the milkshake, which I have not had before.  First, the milkshake is BIG--easily two full servings of the glass they give you to pour it into.  (I'd consider splitting it on future trips.)  Second, it is tasty--the vanilla base combines well with the cinnamon-apple taste and the hint of bacon, then accented by the little bits of bacon inside the shake that you can slurp up through the extra-wide straw.  The bourbon also gives a nice background flavor, though I would have preferred just a tad more in my shake.  What I really liked about the milkshake is that none of these flavors--even the sweetness of the cinnamon-apple--dominated the drink.  Service was friendly and attentive, and, as I mentioned before, my food came out lightning fast.  The space (formerly Agave) suits B Spot well.  The al fresco dining is nice, particularly from the effect of being near similar outdoor tables at Champps next door and across the street at Blake's and Hyde Park.  The tables inside were fairly well-spaced, though I wonder in the colder months whether they will make it much more crowded to accommodate enough people.  For now, the extra floor space gets occupied by people waiting for tables and partaking in a beer from the bar.  Before we all just run up to the top of the hill and hug, there are some negatives:  First, they give a warning when you choose how you want your burger cooked that B Spot usually cooks burgers one notch under what you order them at (e.g., medium rare when you order medium).  The obvious response is, well, why don't you just cook it one notch longer than you usually do?  I'm sure they would say something like it has to do with the thickness of the hamburger patties, but I don't think the patties, while a little thicker than your normal restaurant burger, are so incredibly thick as to be that unwieldy while cooking (as opposed to something like a super-thick patty at Kuma's Corner in Chicago).  Second, as some people have noted regarding other locations, B Spot seems to revel in a certain jerk attitude.  To be sure, the actual servers were friendly, and I can understand the aversion to substitutions.  But, I can do without the signs and the little laminated pamphlet calling me a whiny bastard for considering a substitution.  It is really a turn off and very very nearly merited dropping B Spot down to the three-star level in my book."}
{"text":"(I ate here late June 2011)  Amazing! I had the Lola burger (minus the pickled onions) and it was yummy!  The bun was great, super thick delicious bacon, cheddar, mayo, and a perfectly fried egg.  I ate the whole burger!  They're not huge, so get the rosemary shoestring fries which are also tasty!"}
{"text":"We travel in once a year from the Memphis area and must stop here for a burger. The food is awesome, if you like to try new stuff always go for the special! Service is always great and upbeat. The atmosphere and interior design is extremely creative to those who are interested in design! A great beer and music selection always top off the experience. We wish there was a B spot closer to home!"}
{"text":"Went last Saturday afternoon and was seated immediately--plus!!! Ordered a Dortmunder that came out cold in a big glass--another plus!!! Ordered a Bruben that was inhaled---delish! Bigger helpings as I am a food whore... Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"What's with all the haters!?  This place is awesome.  I am a burger fiend and I loved the ones here.  My burger was cooked exactly how I wanted and the ingredients were quality.  Creative options, meat-heavy, sweet pickle bar and cool sauces on each table.  And the vanilla-apple-pie-bacon shake sounded questionable but was amazing.  Great service, came for lunch and didn't have to wait much."}
{"text":"Okay place. Met a friend from out of town there for a rather late dinner while he was stranded in Cleveland (no one comes here on purpose I suppose lol).   Lime Cilantro wings were great. I've worked as a cook in Atlanta and Cleveland...no one has ever had the nuts to cook chicken wings to the absolute correct temp and not go over. I mean these things were hot, juicy, tender, and the sauce was a perfect compliment.   Burgers were delish, Lola fries were meh. Being super thin like that, they were cold about 20 seconds after hitting the table.   Can't give ya more than 2 stars, however, because just about every beer we tried to order was out. We finally managed to hit one that was available. Kind of got the impression that the bartender was trying to shut down early (hey it was like 9 on a Tuesday...I get that they weren't busy, but shit the sign says you're open until 10...doesn't that mean I can get anything on the menu until 10:01? I know that's how the joints I worked in operated...but yeah I guess Strongsville, OH ain't Atlanta, GA).  Anyhow, also was not a fan of bringing everything to the table at once. The wings got cold (they were still pretty good) while we ate our burgers. I dunno. I guess the \"fast food\" style of service works for some.  Anyhow...good food. Just don't go past 8 PM I guess."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times and always a pleasure. The vanilla bean, apple pie, bacon milkshake is awesome!  The burgers are unique, tastey and just the right size. The chips and rosemary cheese dip are good too."}
{"text":"I need to experiment with the menu more - but you just can't go wrong with a Fat Doug, chips and fond due dip, and a vanilla bean/apple pie/bacon milkshake."}
{"text":"I had been visiting the Cleveland area and had stumbled on and so glad that I did. I was with my mother who is very difficult to please when she does eat out and had said the veggie burger was good and she would have it again.  I did not have a drink, but they seemed to be well stocked.  I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone and would live to come back"}
{"text":"As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place was below average.   The scene was trendy but the food and service were not the best.  My wife and I split what was called a \"Stripper\" salad which was a blue cheese covered salad with a burger on top.  The salad came drenched and dripping in dressing, which is never a good thing.  We ordered the burger to be medium and it came out medium rare.  It didn't even fit the description of the supposed to be clever description card on the table.  Our waitress needed an attitude adjustment.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but that doesn't fly when you are in the service industry.  We had to get our own silverware and the bill was dropped off before we were halfway done with our meal, which made us feel rushed.  The only saving grace this place has is the variety of sauces that are placed on the tables to use on fries, burgers or whatever you like.  There were some interesting combinations, but all of them were good.  I would not recommend this place over some other gourmet burger places in the area.  Rail beats this place hands down."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the best burger within 50 miles of Cleveland. And I recommend the Lola fries."}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying that the service at BSpot is really good! We went during happy hour and had a great time.     I ordered the Lola burger and added avocado with a side salad, onion rings, and the rosemary fries ( only 1$ during happy hour).  I couldn't decide b/t fries and onion rings and I knew I needed something green. I'd never had rosemary fries before and they were delicious! I'll def have to starting adding rosemary to my fries at home!  The onion rings were your standard beer-battered-fried onion ring goodness!  And the burger was super delicious. My medium well Lola burger had pickled red onions and cheddar cheese. The meat was seasoned really well and the flavor combination was wonderful. The bread was buttery, toasted to perfection, and tasted heavenly with the other ingredients.   I also would like to highlight the customer service. I ordered my burger medium well, took one bite and realized it came out medium rare to rare. I informed my server and let him know that I was too full from my beer and sides to eat a replacement burger. Shortly after the manager came to the table, sincerely apologized, and offered a to-go burger on the house.  The server then followed up a few min later,apologized once again, and let me know the to-go burger would be out shortly.    I understand that mistakes are bound to happen and I greatly appreciate the way they handled the situation and their excellent customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger joint. Have been many times now. Best onion rings by far, burgers are wonderful but if you like medium rare, order medium! Pickle bar is a good addition and of the 6 sauces, i still like heinz the best. Ordered the garlic parmesan wings and they were good - not amazing - mostly just because the wings themselves were cooked so well. next time we'll try the sriracha wings. And one day i'm ordering that apple pie bourbon milkshake... one day..."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to b spot. O have to say that I was a little disappointed in the size of the burger and that for the price there was mo side to go with it.  The quality was great, the onion rings were probably the best I have ever had. And the real reason I went, the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake, exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"I am not entirely sure that I am qualified to write this review (as will become apparent), so this will serve more as a sort of largely unnecessary, and probably redundant, commentary on who probably SHOULDN'T make an effort to check out this restaurant.  As a vegetarian who decided to patronize Iron Chef, and meat-enthusiast-extrordinaire, Michael Symon's burger spot, I certainly got what I deserved.  In my defense, it was the most conveniently located and interesting venue near the highway where I could quickly meet a relative mid-road trip.  Anyway, the only (and I mean ONLY) vegetarian option on the menu is a portobella burger--plaintively entitled 'WHY???'--that you are not permitted to make any alterations or additions to.  All the delicious smelling fried foods are fried in lard, so they are similarly not a viable option.  It is VERY slim pickings, and despite many meat-eaters concern that being a vegetarian who enjoys eating out just must be \"so hard\", in reality it is rarely as difficult or limiting as at B Spot.  NO OFFENSE TO THE AMAZING MICHAEL SYMON.  We're not his crowd, no biggie.  Anyway, as far as milieu this restaurant is in a relatively fancy strip mall, and seems to be catering to the wealthy shoppers looking for a semi-quick bite of all-american food during lunchtime.  The bratwurst looked pretty amazing--but of course I can not speak to that personally and I have a penchant for german food that not everyone shares.  Sporting a view of the nearby Starbucks, this is not the most unique spot but it will probably totally satisfy all you meat eaters on the errand warpath."}
{"text":"So glad I finally got a chance to try B Spot!  The milkshake (cookies and cream) was faaantastic. Lovely and thick and delicious.   I had the Fun Guy burger and it was SO good!  I got t medium rare which is what I usually do and it was cooked perfectly. I like it a lot, too, because while it was big, it wasn't big to the point where it was TOO much.   Also, the onion rings are literally perfect. The onion comes off WITH every bite, instead of dangling post bite.   Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Great fries, great shakes, great tasting burgers.  Only negative is the size of the burgers for the price.  My two kids and I, no alcohol, two shakes, burgers and fries, $60 some dollars.   Seems like a lot but it was very good.     I'd still recommend it and I do still go back."}
{"text":"There are no half-stars on Yelp, and I feel like I need to be a little nicer with my ratings.  But I'm going to go between \"A-OK\" and \"Yay! I'm a fan.\".... So, 4 stars instead of 3 for \"A-okay I'm a fan\"!  Bacon Apple Pie Vanilla Milk Shake.  Score. Yes. And those words might not be in the correct order, but those are the correct ingredients! A+ for creativity and something unexpected, but that works!!!   PICKLE BAR. I love this because of the sweet & sour pickles (I THINK that's what they were). They are SO GOOD.  There are 3 varieties of pickles to choose from here. It's clever. Different.  B Spot has a very simple, organized menu with a very creative spin on traditional diner fare (ie: that amazing shake). All the burgers, save for the mushroom burger, are basically for meat LOVERS. The burger patty itself becomes a condiment along with the lettuce, tomato, etc. because there is a different kind of meat on each burger, depending on what you pick. Pastrami in your burger, steak in your burger, turkey in your burger, now I'm making up different meats to go in your burger, but it really is something like that! (Prices I think range from $7-11ish? Check the website or call...)  The mushroom burger isn't amazing, but it was still OKAY.  It's just a mushroom cap in your burger. (Go to Lopez in Cleveland Heights for the most amazing mushroom burger).  Fries with cheese whiz and pulled pork ($5, as with the other items in this category). Yay for the fries (the long and skinny type), nay on the cheese whiz...(but it's so unbelievable you start to believe that Michael Symon somehow managed to make cheese whiz good). Pulled pork worked alright with this combination...  \"CHIPS\" = pretty impressive for \"chips.\" i think they're made in the restaurant, it's like a kettle style chip, but what REALLY matters is that it's served with a parmesan rosemary cheese fondue which is really good.  The salads are HUGE. My roommate looked like she bought greens at a grocery store and dumped the entire bag of it onto a dinner plate.  B Spot is different from your ordinary diner, which is a good thing. It's worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Returned to sit at the bar, have a couple beers and a couple apps.  Once again ordered the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, which is becoming one of my favorite beers.  Ordered the garlic parm wings (of course) and the chili cheese fries.  Walked out fat and happy, which is the only way to leave this place."}
{"text":"Michael Symon place.  Burgers are over priced and j am kind of whatever on this place."}
{"text":"Tried B Spot a few times, each time there was bone or gristle in the burger meat that I had to spit out. I would think that the famed iron chef would know how to source his ground beef properly. The final straw was a terrible case of food poisoning; I'm never going to a Michael Simon restaurants ever again!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to B-Spot since they opened once or twice a year. Tonight was culinary perfection. I got The Clevelander, bratwurst,coleslaw, and French fries on a pretzel roll. This bratwurst was the best I have ever had. This was in fact the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I added items from the pickle bar to spice the sandwich up further. Service and atmosphere was great. Chef Michael Symon continues to impress."}
{"text":"Food is good. Bar staff great. A little annoying there is a 30 minute wait with seven empty tables the whole time we waited. Not fair to the lady at front desk. She was overwhelmed checking people in. Needed another person to seat people."}
{"text":"People rave about the Happy Hours at Symon's Roast restaurant in Detroit, and I certainly have nothing but good things to say about our recent visit to this B Spot restaurant during happy hour! I've long used the nearby Barnes and Noble as a frequent stop and meeting place when I travel out this way, so I'm familiar with the location of this upscale shopping mall (and it's increasingly busy parking lot)...but don't let that put you off of this place tucked into the strip a couple of doors down from the B&N. We stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner on a weekday and found no problems getting a seat or service. Loved the variety of burgers and toppings. Went for a bologna and burger combo, while my dining companion had the Lola burger, topped with a fried egg. At 1/3 pound of patty and tons of toppings, these burgers were generous without being so large you couldn't eat them in one sitting. The Lola fries at the happy hour price of $1 were a real steal. We loved these rosemary-seasoned fries. Our meals arrived hot and quickly, and we had a great server. Two burgers, two orders of fries, a beer, a coffee and a 20-percent tip set us back less than $25, and the meal was more than enough that we didn't need anything else to eat the rest of the night. Be sure to check out the small condiment bar, which had several varieties of local and regional pickles to top your burgers. Our seat overlooked the B&N inside of the mall, and it was nice to take a short walk inside of the mall after dinner on a cold and miserable day...and pop into the B&N for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place and finally got to try it today. Got the Yo burger and a side of fries. Burger was delicious and the fries were on point! I just started working in the Eton tower so I will definitely be making this a weekly stop."}
{"text":"What's up with all the flies!?! I just enjoyed a great burger, great beer with great service. My guests and I couldn't help but notice the abundance of flies in and around the kitchen. We watched as the flies were landing on all the food waiting to be delivered to the tables. I assume the problem is being addressed.... FYI, get the apple pie, bacon shake and  then grab some elastic pants."}
{"text":"Rosemary french fries were awesome. I really dug the surplus of sauce options on the tables. Also, fuck yeah pickle bar! I think every burger place should follow that example and offer a multitude of pickled options.  My only regret is not ordering the onion rings. I caught a glance at them on a neighboring table and got super jealous."}
{"text":"The reviews are too low here, this place is simply amazing. If you want food that has a ton of flavor then you have arrived at the right spot. My burger was so good, every ingredient had the right qualities about them. Not sure how someone could not enjoy the food here!  This should be one of the best burgers in Cleveland, truly gourmet stuff at a reasonable price. For any burger lover, I would put this on your list of must try."}
{"text":"Several co workers recommended this restaurant.  So today after work I checked it out.  I ordered the New Jack City,  visited the pickle bar and watched the vibes.  The waitress at the bar was phenomenal,  although my receipt says Pierre.  I plan to go back for Happy Hour"}
{"text":"So I have yet to stop in to B Spot for dinner and not wait at least 30 minutes for a table. This place seems busy all the time.   The burgers are inventive and fun - I enjoy the fries and love the pickle bar.   For those who like Michael Symon and want a piece of his action without going whole hog (pun intended), this is a good place to do it. I am glad the hotel I stay at when I am in Cleveland is close to a fun, tasty place to eat."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on Friday and it was better than we expected. The atmosphere was nice and our waiter was great! I had the Thin Lizzy burger and it was very good. The sunny side up egg was a great addition. The onion rings were very good and oh that chocolate shake! That shake was so good and thick, I could barely finish it. If you went just for the shakes you wouldn't be disappointed. The downside is that it's in a shopping area and one side is in a \"mall\". Still, a great place if you want a good burger and a killer shake."}
{"text":"I believe we went with some friends for $5 burger night! Great deal food is good. Took our kids as well. Got busy at one point noise as well. But not to loud. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is a wonderful person! His burgers are so good! The menu is fun and unique with someone for everyone. The rosemary fries are such a great pair to a burger. The burgers are huge and filling but you must leave room for one of his milkshakes. They are so worth it! I personally enjoy a little booze in my shake ;)"}
{"text":"3 stars for the limited menu. No veggie burgers so I was forced to get a grilled cheese. The sauces were good, my favorites were the stadium mustard and lolas ketchup. Decently priced food. Average service. Great location!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers.  It really is one of the best burgers I've had (along with 25 Degrees in Hollywood).  Good milkshake made better with bourbon.  Damn good place to eat."}
{"text":"ended up at  B Spot last night via my friend who I was visiting. Now being from NYC  I have had my share of great burgers but what a suprise in Stronsgville , Ohio? The burger was perfect size, juicy and tasty. The burger looked great, on an awesome brioche bun, that put it over the top man. The fries looked home made but I'm not sure of that, regardless they were good. We sat at the bar, great setting, nice people, friendly staff, The decor was contemporary, I liked it.  I would go back( if I ever come back to Stronsville). Great job all around, wish you the best!"}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland this past weekend and we loved the place! Great burgers, atmosphere, and new age bathrooms. Had trouble turning the sink off, but the wall of vintage beer cans was cool! It is located next to the Champps in the Westlake Mall."}
{"text":"When I rate a burger, I don't rate it based upon the quality or quantity of toppings.  I look at the quality and flavor of the basic beef and bun, and how well they are prepared.  This puts this burger among my favorites.  I had only been to the other location at Quicken Loans Arena before event.  This has broader menu choices including salads and sandwiches.  I was there for a late lunch, and ending up sitting at the bar, since there was a delay in regular seating.  Server was friendly and timely.  Prices are a bit steep and you have to pay extra for sides.  Lola fries and ketchup are amazingly addicting.  I really like this place and would return."}
{"text":"Ate the Porky Burger and it was delicious! Great food and fabulous environment!   Cannot wait for the one to open in Columbus, Ohio"}
{"text":"My first visit and I was underwhelmed. I have heard so much about B Spot so I took my daughter out to dinner there. The fries were very average. The burger was less than average. Service was very good and it is a fun place to go. Probably wouldn't return with so many other better options."}
{"text":"Not my favorite B Spot location but the food, beer, pickles, and milkshakes were good!   I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was really good. Tried the onion rings for the first time, also really good!"}
{"text":"Wow, the elusive 5 stars!  Let's be honest.  It's tough to screw up a burger, but I think it's hard to make it stand out and this is exactly what they did.  Jumped right into my burger top 5.  Of course I forgot the burger name, but it had a (perfectly!) sunny side up egg to top it off.  It might have been called the Lola or something.  Pretty sure it was a chick's name anyhow.  Also was.told the thin lizzie burger was very good.  Onion rings were very good and they had some specially blended ketchup on the table that paired great with the rings.  Didn't put it on the burger as it didn't need anything.  What a great find for a weary traveler.  Wish I was local so I could return.  I heard the shakes were killer but didn't sample it myself.  Go here!  Appreciate what you have!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is only a 3.5 stars so far! It should at least be 4 stars! I've been to Bspot about 10+ times now and it has never failed on me. It's a great atmosphere and I always take my out of town friends to Bspot and nobody has ever complained about it yet.  Appetizers: Lola fries. They are soooo delicious and the rosemary flavors are so good! It's a spot on fries dish. Probably one of the best fries I've ever had, easily.  Shakes: I've tried the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow shake and the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake. I wasn't very impressed with the chocolate banana marshmallow shake- don't get me wrong the taste is delicious but it just taste like a very nicely made chocolate milkshake topped with marshmallow. Where's the bananas?! Then, the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake really surprised me. It was soooo good and the flavors just work so well together. There's bacon bits in there and hey, you always hear them say that bacon makes everything taste good, and it really does!  Burgers: my boyfriend LOVES the red hot burger and always orders that. As for me, the shroomage burger is my favorite. I love that they use an entire portabello mushroom instead of mushroom pieces.   Definitely try this place if you haven't, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well reviews are all over the place for this place!   I came in here with high expectations and was not disappointed. 4.5 stars. Not sure why so many people have a \"beef\" with this place. I just don't get it, well opinions are like culos!  I got  what ever burger has pulled pork,  hot peppers and some other stuff and onion rings. I kind of shared it with a friend.  She had a few bites and some onion rings. We were unable to finish the rings.when I did not take them home,she looked at me funny   The burger was cooked perfectly pink. The meat was very fresh and had that perfect fat to meat ratio.  The rings were quite tasty. I actually prefer things to be cooked in peanut oil.  I really can not think of a place that does burgers better than this.  The pickle bar is an added bonus.  I did not get a shake nor did I have any desire. I think this place should have tater tots.  Great selection of condiments!"}
{"text":"Once again, we were blown away by the care and attention we received here.  I've lost track of how many times we've eaten at B Spot, but I can tell you, the service and food are consistent and worth waiting for.  This particular occasion was on a busy Friday night.  We had to wait (love the Starbucks on the corner - the reservation buzzer's sensor reaches that far!), and had a couple with us eating at B Spot for the first time.    Our server, Sarah, was lovely.  And while everyone else's dinner was perfect, my husband's burger was not prepared the way he asked for it.  He sent it back once and it returned ill-prepared.  The manager, Lauren, was sure to check in on us and took the burger off the bill after the second mistake.  She was so nice and apologetic, and did well to smooth things over.  I hugged her on our way out.  I'm sure Michael Symon would do the same."}
{"text":"For my hubby's birthday yesterday, we included a trip to B Spot for an early dinner. We drove from Medina to Cleveland in driving snow for, what turned out to be, the best burgers of our lives!    I am one who usually pulls a Meg Ryan from \"When Harry Met Sally\" and makes exceptions to her meals.  Maybe not to that extreme, but there's always something I like to change or have \"on the side.'\"  Because of the \"Symon Says\" rules placed at the table, I decided to order everything as it was listed on the menu.  Good call.    We decided on the lime & cilantro wings, Lola fries and two burgers: Chilly Willy & Symon Says.  Is it possible to make a chili burger gourmet?  Yes.  And is it possible to make a burger with bologna sound good?  Double yes!  The latter was mine and I was in a dream state with every bite.  To be honest, the fries were just average and aren't something I'd order again (though they did make a great vehicle for tasting the shasha and coffee BBQ sauces (you must!).  Trust me, the burgers are filling!  Plus, seating is limited and I can imagine this place gets plenty busy on any other day.  I found the pricing to be reasonable and the menu surprisingly varied for being so small.   There are several other meal choices I want to try here, including the tomato blue cheese soup, Shroomage & Red Hot burgers, bratwurst and Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake (with bourbon, natch).  Is B Spot Burgers worth braving a blizzard for?  The answer is yes."}
{"text":"Horrible, uninformed waitress kind of put a cloud over our visit. Happy hour is a good deal for beer, but since they stopped the five dollar burger there isn't much to be happy about there anymore. Mr. Simon you better pay attention to what's happening here, it is kind of rolling down down down Main Street rapidly."}
{"text":"Hubs and I visited B Spot for lunch. We got there around 11:45 am and were seated immediately. We both got burgers, sides of fries, and split a milkshake. This lunch cost us ~$50 with tip. The burgers and fries were good, and the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake with bourbon was delicious.  However, I did not feel that they were ~$50 worth of good and delicious. The milkshake alone was $9. I do not mind paying for a nice meal, but I do not feel that I got what I paid for at this restaurant. The food at B Spot is good but not worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food is all delivered at one time.  Very annoying, which we decided to not buy any appetizers.  Their loss, not ours.  The Yo! Burger with the Salami was pretty good actually and that's probably the only saving grace for this place.  The draft beer selection appeared to be pretty good, but I passed on this to try a milkshake instead.  The vanilla apple pie bacon milkshake was not good.  There were only 4 small pieces of bacon on top.  Never tasted that again after those little pieces.  The shake appeared to be mostly vanilla and a few small pieces of apple pie crust.  The cook did not mix the shake well enough and when pouring it, it got all over the place and I lost half my shake on the table.  Not cool, but luckily it did not taste good.  I've had better milkshakes from McDonalds.  I did sample someone else's Chocolate shake, and while it was better than mine, I still think fast food joints outdid these.  The side of fries were the pitiful string fries and there weren't that many in their metal container.  Another disappointment.    Good burger, Bad everything else.  I'd prob go somewhere else first unless I wanted only a burger and no sides.  Oh and the pickle bar was pretty good.  Lots of different spicy pickles, onions, etc."}
{"text":"I'm new to Cleveland and was looking for a quick and casual place to get lunch. After reading about B Spot on Google Maps, I decided to give it a try!  The location is right by the main entrance to the mall, and there is both indoor and outdoor seating. I went on a Monday around 2 pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty.   To be honest, the two hostesses' that I met were not very kind, one of them looked at me and ignored me, and the other seemed apathetic about her job. I wasn't dismayed and sat in a booth. My server was very nice and patient. I ended up deciding on the Impossible Burger, a plant-based burger that tasted just like a regular meat burger. That burger was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend trying the Impossible Burger. I believe that this burger has definitely set the bar high for future vegetarian burgers.   In addition, there are fun sauces and a pickle bar to check out!   Overall, delicious food and average service, but I do recommend B Spot if you're craving a burger or for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty. The price is ridiculously high. The turn off, employees using bare hands to fill the pickled bar.  After seeing that we can never return."}
{"text":"Wow.  Are you kidding?  Is the first thing I see when I sit down, before I look at a menu or even order a drink, really going to be a two page list of \"rules\"?  That doesn't exactly scream \"welcome!\"  It was also the first time my friend and I had been here, so we were treated to the whole rundown.  And when I say \"treated\" I mean we got a lecture.  Remember the narrator from the Micro Machine commercials back in the day?  The guy that was like a coked out auctioneer?  That's what our server sounded like and it STILL felt like it took him forever to get through the whole spiel.  At this point I'm stressed out and we haven't even been here for five minutes.    Not to harp on this whole \"rule\" thing, but ending the list with \"and if you're squinting your eyes after reading this maybe you're too uptight\" is pretty classless.  It doesn't come across as funny or witty; it just makes you sound like kind of a jerk.  You have a TWO PAGE LIST OF RULES for your BURGER joint...I think you might be confused as to which of us is the uptight one.  I'm not one of those \"I'm the customer so I should get whatever I want\" people, far from it, but seriously, this is too far in the other direction.  If the high school kid at Burger King can pull off customizing a burger, I'm pretty sure someone with Michael Symon's credentials can.  I'm not a chef, nor do I have what I'd call a \"refined palette,\" so maybe my problem is that I just don't buy into the pretentious burgers-as-art-form idea.    Which brings us to the food.  Once we were properly informed of our rights and the boundaries within which we were allowed to order, my friend got the Thin Lizzy burger and I ended up getting a chilli-cheese brat.  Everything is separate, meaning the burger is just a burger and if you want chips or fries you have to order them separately.  My friend's burger was $8.  The chips were $5.  Neither were anywhere near worth that price.  The burger itself was halfway between the size of a slider and a regular sized burger, and the chips, while plentiful, were kind of soggy and not something that should have a $5 price tag.  For my part, the brat was just mediocre at best.  Not bad, but not impressive either.     To be fair, it wasn't all bad.  The beer selection, both draft and bottles, was great.  We were there on a Tuesday night and they had the beer I wanted still on draft, so I can't speak to whether or not they run out, but just going by what's on the menu it's an impressive selection.  And our server Brandon was fantastic.  Intro spiel aside, he was friendly and did a great job.  This review shouldn't be taken as a dig against this specific location.    Here's the thing - I avoid hype like the plague.  It's not fair to the restaurant or to the customer to set people up with super high, often unrealistic expectations.  When someone raves and raves about a restaurant I always take it with a grain of salt.  Before coming here all I knew about B Spot was: 1) it's a burger place, 2) Michael Symon was involved, and 3) my friend told me it had a good beer selection.  That was it.  My expectations were pretty much non-existent and this place still left me with an overwhelming desire to leave as quickly as possible and never come back.    It's just my personal preference, but anytime I want a good burger I'll be sticking with Beer Engine or Fat Heads (this place makes Fat Head's ridiculous \"potato rule\" seem tame by comparison).  Both of them are cheaper, just as good, have a better beer selection, and are places that you could actually just eat, drink, and relax with friends.  If you really want to eat at a Symon restaurant, stick with Lolita.  This place is to be avoided."}
{"text":"I come from a city in which it's difficult (impossible?) to find a good burger--so I was pleased to stumbled across this burger joint while visiting the Apple store nearby. I got the Fun Guy, which was your typical bleu cheese, mushroom, and grilled onion burger. They actually temped my burger accurately at medium rare and it was deliciously cooked without being overly greasy. You're paying $8-10 for these burgers, but they are assuredly thick (I'm going to assume close to 1/2 pound?), cooked to perfection, and tasty. The atmosphere was great and the service was also top-notch."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The food is perfect and the staff is friendly. Even the wait times on peak days/times are minimal. Best burgers around!"}
{"text":"The family and I have been here twice for lunch, we love it! Casual spot with great burgers. My 11 year old son is not a burger guy so he gets the chicken which he enjoys - and he's a picky eater lol. They have a condiment bar where you can add pickles and other toppings to your burgers. Also, have a number of different sauces and ketchup, made in house, to put on your fries and sandwiches.  Besides burgers they have great fries, awesome onion rings, bologna, chicken, big shakes and a great drink menu. Plenty of draft and bottled beer to choose from. The spot is clean, service has always been good and we always leave full. It's located in a nice strip mall with stores like Apple, Lucky and Barnes & Noble just to name a few. Nice outdoor seating for when the weather is good. If you're in the Beechwood area I'd definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"B Spot?...  ...or is it G...?  Pros: Good Burgers. Good Root Beer Float (get it with rum!!) Try Lola Ketchup if you're into spicy food. I got the chili burger (it had a different name)--very good. Chili was good also. Fries--it was okay, nothing too special  Cons: The cost of the root beer float w/ rum was kinda pricey. For 4 people, our bill was $70 (without tip) and we shared one order of fries.   Service: Quick!   Location: Easy located. Nice neighborhood shopping area."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Michael Symon restaurant and was excited to try his burger joint. I had looked at the menu's for some of his other places and knew they were on the pricey side. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the B Spot is actually very reasonable.  The choices of burgers make it hard to choose, I ended up with a burger topped with pulled pork that was awesome. The onion rings were cooked to perfection, the pickle bar a great treat, had to go back twice. Watch out for the hot burger, don't remember the name but you will know it when you see it. I love hot but this one sounded like a bit of overkill, jalapeños, ghost chili, Trinidad scorpion, and habanero sauce. We had one in our party try it and did he sweat. Also a great bourbon selection.  Staff here is very attentive, only negative is parking. There is a lot of garages in the area, but if you do not know where you are going, just park to look for the place, it can take a bit. Especially if a thunderstorm pops up while your looking."}
{"text":"It's a regular stop now...bananna marshmallow milkshake...Mmm."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers in the Cleveland-area.   The french onion burger is just phenomenal, and Symon's bloody mary is something to be reckoned with.  Happy hour is a great deal with $3 drafts (and an impressive beer-list, too!), $5 burgers, and $1 fries."}
{"text":"I think that whole No Whining thing is b.s. because I'm here to write my opinion, if you don't like it, don't read it.  Went here on a Wednesday evening for dinner, waited about 20-25 minutes...the seating is awkward, there is one long booth with chairs across so you are really sharing your meal with about 30 other people. Plus it's really cramped, like there's not a lot of room, people kept bumping into things.  Also, everyone there seemed really chilly, I was fine, but everyone around us was stating how cold they were.   When my friend's milkshake arrived, the didn't pour any in the glass, just served it in the one they made it in. Which is fine, but it equaled a big mess. We both got burgers, one cheese one bacon and cheese, nothing out of this world, I was really expecting better. The fries were tiny and I didn't really like them. And for the price, I'd almost rather go to Five Guys...  However, I did like the decor, it was trendy. And I liked the idea that the server can swipe your card on a mobile device, very neat. But they still have to go grab a receipt. Overall, for for 20 bucks, I think it's worth a try but I don't know if I'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I liked this location much better than Strongsville. Less crowded, felt bigger to me, and the food was better quality. I had the chili brat which for the price was the right size, very filling. I think our waiter was a little stiff but whatever. The theme was the exact same as the other restaurant. But, I went during lunch so it was not crowded at all. I adore the lola fried, they are so good. However, since there was not many people in the place, the hostess sat this mom and her mom and the newborn baby right next to us. I mean I have nice cold beer in my hand enjoying catching up with my friend, I do not want to listen to you gaga over your baby the whole damn time. I almost asked if we could move, but then we just oddly stared at these people. Anyways, still think it'd be a better place in the summer, but still I'd give the brat a try!"}
{"text":"Low key casual place to grab a gourmet burger and beer.   Burgers are actually a perfect size, probably 1/3 lb.  Not a fan of the Lola sauce but it's unique.   Pickle bar is good and beer choices even better.   Fries are great and the milkshakes look delicious.   I'll be back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Love the kimchi. I tried out the impossible lizzy burger and it was so good and totally meatless! The rotating Belgian and sour ales are also delicious. We ate at the bar to avoid the wait and we were served quickly and kindly."}
{"text":"Burger was okay, seemed small though. Fries tasted like cheap breakfast sausage, not a fan. Nearly $40 for 3 burgers and 3 sides. No thanks, rather go Wendy's. Burger at Texas Roadhouse completely blows this away, much friendlier staff to boot."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Great vibe. Yummy food. Kinda pricey for the portion size. Great beer selection. Lola fries are clutch.   We'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I came in to try this meatless burger that's supposed to have the texture of meat. I had my doubts (I'm a meat eater, and was vegetarian during college at which time I was not impressed by veggie burgers). Does it taste \"like meat\"... maybe not exactly, but does it taste delicious? Absolutely! I'm so happy they decided to carry this product as I think it shows a wider social responsibility. The service, other food items, and experience were also great."}
{"text":"Having deeply enjoyed Michael Symon's other restaurants, I anticipated a night at B Spot would be one of the best burgers I've tasted.  Unfortunately, even ignoring the cachet of Symon, this was one of the most mediocre burgers I've ever eaten.    I had the bacon cheeseburger, without cheese, and requested that it be cooked medium.  Of the four burgers ordered by our party, three were overcooked.  The only one that wasn't overcooked was the one which was requested to be well-done; that one was undercooked.    I anticipated biting into a juicy burger of high-quality meat with plenty of beefy flavor.  Instead, the burger was dry and flavorless.  Dousing it with the house's delicious balsamic steak sauce rendered it barely edible, but still without any meat flavor.  My husband and one friend had the Lola Burger and reported that it tasted better in the middle, when the fried egg lent moistness to the burger.  Alas, I did not have that addition.  Even the bacon's flavor was flat - a real shock in a Michael Symon restaurant.  Our friend's daughter had a bratwurst, which was also dry and stiff.  The chicken wings were good and juicy, though, and the Lola fries are a real treat as always.  The milk shakes were reportedly tasty, though one of them had to be remade because it contained banana even after the waiter was specifically and repeatedly asked to omit it.  This was another problem; the service was adequate but not terribly attentive.  We were not offered refills on water or drinks.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table, my friends and I couldn't carry on a conversation because the music was far louder than necessary.  I don't have any plans on returning to B Spot, but it wasn't bad enough that I would refuse to eat there if friends wanted to, and if there was no wait.  Otherwise, it's not an experience I care to repeat.  If I ever end up there again, I will have Lola fries and wings.  They are the only reason there are two stars in this review."}
{"text":"Lola burger delivered! Sweet onions keeps your palete coming bite after bite. The spiced fries are great in flavor but then frozen stuff I'm not a big fan of. Better order the homemade chips.  Motorcycle parts as hanging ornements around the bar is a nice touch. The signature beer wall looks great. Bar stools feels kinda short. Parking is challenging given the amount of stores in the area.   Will come back for another burger creation, the effecient staff and patio."}
{"text":"OK and better than McDonald's but not as good as Steak 'n Shake or Johnnie Rockets; the burgers came as we asked, medium rare, but with little cheese, yet good onions. The bun was thick and tasteless, too much bread without spark! The fries were sorta crisp as we requested but tatseless too; they say thick fries? Huh? Not as good as those at Five Guys. The pickle bar is a cute idea but if you want burgers make this better, and the pulled pork was dismal and tasteless. Sorry, sorry, but we love the blackboard and concept. But improve it."}
{"text":"Never get disappointed with the burgers here. Service is always on par with the food.  I love the \" Lola burger\"  If passing by must eat burger joint for non clevelanders ..."}
{"text":"My 3 star rating is on the craft cocktails only. When I typed in best craft cocktails Strongsville, this place was number one on the list. The margarita I had, at best, was mediocre. However the place seems super cute and the menu looks amazing. They even have a pickle bar. Next time I'm in town and in the mood for a burger I will certainly try it. But I'd probably just order 1 of beers instead of a cocktail."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, they told me about all the special sauces. Great beer selection. I had the Lola burger and fries. Cooked perfectly, great flavor of beef. The bun is amazing, star of the show. The fries were thin and crispy with salt and rosemary, quite unique and tasty. I will be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I ordered the portobello burger.  They offer numerous items that can be added to their burgers for $1.25, but NOT the Portobello burger!!  After some discussion, the waitress asked the manager for approval to add red peppers for $1.25.  The burger was on a bun that fell apart immediately.  The mushroom had a very bad taste and the red pepper add on were a few little strings of red pepper served on the side in a very small paper cup that would usually be used for catchup.  Loud, noisy bar atmosphere.  Nothing here to ever compel me to return."}
{"text":"The burger I ordered was good but not great.  I was expecting more form a Simon Restaurant.  I ordered the New Jack City Burger which was supposed to be spicy.  I didn't taste much spice at all.  The burger was cooked perfectly though."}
{"text":"After careful thought I deliver a rating of 4.  Food tastes great...however portion size & price point takes away from 5 stars. Burgers are very creative, cool atmosphere.  However, there are no sides that come with the upper echelon priced dish, no substitutions and the size is not what I expect for the price.  I will possibly come back, but not rush back."}
{"text":"Really, no veggie burger? Having grown up in LA and having lived in France and San Francisco I am forever defending Cleveland's burgeoning food scene--but after eating at B Spot and not seeing a veggie burger option on the menu--I have to say that at B Spot Cleveland lives up to its Midwestern crappy food reputation. I suppose Michael Symon is trying to make some sort of meat-or-the-door opinion here, and he succeeds. I am not a vegetarian but when I see no veggie options, it tells me the establishment is woefully behind the times. Oh well, I won't send visiting friends or family here as the menu simply reflects the negative small minded views that Cleveland is still stuck in 1950s food...."}
{"text":"Burger was dry as a bone.  ingredients not much better.  Definitely not worth the price.  Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What can be better than a good American burger? Oh so many other things, kids, do not even tempt me into telling you. However lately  I've been trying to cultivate the love for burgers in me  the way some people try to stomach hummus or coconut milk.  Because I really want to be bad in a good American way. I want to have a burger worth dying for.   B-spot did not contribute to my love whatsoever. Greasy, filling and not worth it in the end. Just like Five Guys.  Cocktails simply made a horrid impression on me - whoever mixes rootbeer floats with Maker's Mark, should be imprisoned for wasting good whiskey on such a bad experiment. So looks like all of my attempts to die young and beautiful from coronary artery disease have been in vain. I am slowly but surely driving back to Suchi-land after multiple unsuccessful attempts to anchor at Burgarism.  What a disgrace I am."}
{"text":"I think B spot is great! It is definitely a bit surprising that this place has a slightly low rating. I am vegetarian, so I recently ordered a veggie burger using the \"build your own\" option. I ordered the veggie patty topped with avocado, a fried egg, LTO, pepper jack cheese, and sriracha mayo. The pattie was pretty unique and had quinoa in it, unlike many patties that are black bean based. I think the fried egg was a really great touch to the burger because it may have been slightly dry without it. I loved that I could add anything from the pickle bar to my burger, so I spiced up the burger with some pickled red onions and jalapenos. Overall- great flavors. Burgers can be so bland sometimes, especially since I ordered a veggie burger- but that is not the case at B Spot! The price for these burgers is worth it for the unique qualities of the patty and toppings at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, sad to say but this is not even close to one of the Crown Jewels in Mr. Symon's Cleveland collection. I was here two months ago with 6 coworkers and I thought the slowness and lack of personality of the wait staff was an anomaly. However, I returned today with my son, and it will be my final visit. My actual table server was fine but the the lady who \"threw\" our food on the table was an eye opener. My 18 yr old son even made the unsolicited comment \"that was rude!\"  I was nearly mowed down by 3 separate servers with no acknowledgement that I was even there. Quite unbelievable really. I see why this place has slipped into the yellow ratings and heading down. Food quality was acceptable with the exception that my son ordered \"mid-well\" (their term) and received med-rare/ medium at best. Lastly, I brought all of this to the attention of the day manager Brittany. She was apologetic and seemed genuinely concerned. She asked if there was something she could do, but my stance is that if I have pointed out poor service to you I shouldn't then have to ask for some form of compensation - You should simply offer recompense."}
{"text":"The B Spot has certainly grown on me. I was pretty skeptical of how good Lola fries could be, but they're definitely worth the price -- especially with Happy Hour prices! I no longer live in Cleveland, but I still crave the rosemary fries. The burgers are also great as well. I love that there is both indoor and outdoor seating, high tops and booths and umbrella tables. The service has been all over the place: I once had a really sweet waitress, but I've also had a neglectful waiter who barely came to my table."}
{"text":"I'm big on service and this place was super friendly and very accommodating for the kids I came with.   after coming here it is what I compare all of my burgers to. The pickle bar is fabulous as well obviously if you were a fan of pickles. don't even get me started on the fries or the pork cracklings. definitely just get both and thank me later."}
{"text":"hit or miss. sometimes it's great. sometimes it's ok. we have been numerous times and sometimes i leave feeling really good and other times it is just so so.  they do have a good happy hour, (well they used to. i think they have since changed it up) but  i love that you can design your own burger. i love their pickle bar. what i really LOVE though is the array of condiments on the table. oh. my. gawsh. six different choices for your dipping madness. seriously. dipping heaven. i like choices and i like a lot of choices.  the onion rings are out of this world amazing. huge portion. combined with said dipping sauces mentioned above and i guarantee you will love. plan on sharing those.  there have been times that the cook has messed up our order and that was a little disappointing, but hey, we can not all have our A game on ALL the time right? always room for improvement and can definitely forgive!  looking for a great burger then head over. most times they seem to get it right!"}
{"text":"Cool drink selection. I kinda liked the Bacon Old Fashioned, but the Dude Abides was unreal! Like a root beer float! I liked the open garage door setup, but did allow for flies to annoy us. Awesome Lola Burger and awesome Fat Doug burger. They coulda given ya free fries though."}
{"text":"The YO! burger was the best and juiciest burger that I have ever had. You can't go wrong with fried salami, cappicola and banana peppers topped with provolone on top of a juicy burger! The porky fries were amazing too! Pulled pork, jalapenos and cheese on top of shoestring fried potatoes! If I had to give one suggestion it would be to either increase the size of the burgers a little or serve something with it since the burger was just a little on the small side for something that is priced at $9 with no sides. I would definitely hit this place up again though!"}
{"text":"B-Spot is a tsunami of a meatwave that wants only to envelope you in its beefy goodness until you suffocate in sweet surrender.  I've eaten thousands of burgers, ranging from craptastic to utterly meh to tearjearking-tasty.  It's not superlative to say that B-Spot completely reinvents the category.  They start with a custom grind provided by Pat LaFrieda's Altar of Beef   in Brooklyn (Yes, THAT Pat LaFrieda).  The grind is composed of three cuts, one of which was short rib and the other two I forget (brisket and tenderloin?  Damn, I forget.  More research necessary.  All I know is it's not the Giant Eagle Ground Chuck Valu-Pak).  On my first visit, I had the Porky, as I had just moved back from the South.  I learned to love me some barbecue in the Carolinas, but frankly, it's even better as a burger topping.  Add some fresh bacon slaw and coffee barbecue sauce, and you're *almost* ready to go...  ...after you hit the pickle bar, that is.  The selection of house-pickled items varies slightly from day-to-day, but there are usually pickled cucumbers, red onions, and jalapenos.  I've also seen okra and Hungarian hot peppers on the pickle bar.  I added pickled red onion and green tomato to my Porky and broke into uncontrollable tears.  My server kindly offered to locate psychiatric assistance, and I assured her I would be fine as long as I could use the roll of paper towels as Kleenex.  The beef was cooked perfectly to temp, and so incredibly flavorful, with just enough seasoning.  The fat in the short rib makes for an incredible mouthfeel.  At 10 bucks, it's a freaking bargain.  I'd be happy to pay twice as much for such a quality product.  Considering that Rodeo Food Clown Guy Fieri charges $17 for a burger... B-Spot is doing the community a great service.  On a subsequent visit, I tried the Yo!, which I describe as \"South Philly on a Burger\".  With fried salami *and* capicola, it was a little greasy.  But since they listed those ingredients on the menu, it was my own damn fault.  The creamy provolone and hot peppers played off each other nicely, and just a touch of shasha sauce (a house-made mustard-and-white-wine sauce, spiced with Hungarian banana peppers) set a nice balance.    If you want more sauce--be it ketchup, barbecue sauce, shasha sauce--there is a caddy of condiments on each table.  But seriously.  Ketchup?  That's for amateurs.  Jus sayin.    The Lola fries--seasoned with fresh rosemary, are to die for.  I just wish they had some aioli to go with!  Be forewarned that a portion of Lola fries is enough for two to share.  Unless you're a disgusting hog like me.  The menu is rounded out by some other sandwiches (brats--which my ex-butcher father tells me are delicious, fried bologna, and chicken).  There are some salads (Why would you ever do this to yourself?), and a whole bunch of milkshakes, including adult variants.  I think those are for the suburban soccer moms who predominate this geographic area.  I've sadly passed on the milkshakes and bourbons on each of my visits, as I did not wish to slip into a coma while driving on I-71.  I suppose I'm just going to have to return with my chauffeur.    The service is rudimentary, but pleasant, which is even more spectacular when you consider that most of the floor staff are aged 16-24.  They've clearly had a lot of training, and are excited to work where they do.  Thank you for being so friendly, even when I slob half my burger onto my bib.    Of all the burger joints in Cleveland (or anywhere, really), only Johnny's Little Bar comes remotely close as far as quality of the burger grind.  I'd be happy for someone to prove me wrong, but until then, Michael Symon demonstrates that he knows his way around an animal as well as anyone.  This isn't anything fancy--it's just blue collar fare elevated with top-quality ingredients, and terrific execution behind the line.    Now shut up and take my money!"}
{"text":"This is a cool casual burger joint.  The burger I had with slaw and pastrami on was amazing.  The have a pickle bar with all sorts of pickled veggies, really cool.  The fries tasted of rosemary and were excellent also.  I was hoping for a more local and or more interesting draft selection, but I guess you can't have it all.  Great place, great prices on burgers.  This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Burgers good, fries great, onion rings nothing special, wait not worth it.  When it settles down I will be back to try the brats."}
{"text":"The porky fries are SO good here! They are one of the main reasons why I enjoy B Spot so much. It is literally like a party in your mouth.   It's typically really crowded on evenings and weekends and there isn't much of a \" waiting room\" when waiting for a table. But honestly, the food is really good and Michael Symon is doing a terrific job of putting the Cleveland area on the map as far as food goes."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time at B Spot.  My husband and I are part-time foodies with an 18-month old who only eats fruit, yogurt, bread and now Lola fries!  The food was great.  We loved our burgers and my husband can't stop talking about the Chocolate Malt with Banana and Nutella, but what made me want to actually write a review was our server.  I wish I could remember his name, but sadly could not.  He was wonderful.  To us, he was aware of our needs and totally on drink refills.  What made this mama's heart happy was how he interacted with our little boy.  We had been shopping all morning and it was nearing lunch and nap time.  Hubs and I hoped little dude would hold out through lunch so we gave him his little truck and snacks to fill the bed while we ate.  Our sweet server built a road out of coasters and made an instant friend.  Little dude made it through a great lunch because our server listened when I told him we were nearing nap time and needed to hurry.  I was impressed that he took the time to help keep little dude occupied and happy!  Thanks for having servers that know how to take care of a hungry family."}
{"text":"The B Spot is one of my favorite spots in Cleveland. I have never had a burger there I didn't like. During today's visit, I had the French Onion burger which was cooked perfectly and had a delicate balance of the gruyere cheese, horseradish, and grilled onions. The Lola fries were, as always, delicious. My dining partner had the Thin Lizzy burger which has pickle, cheddar cheese, and grilled onions. The chocolate milkshake was out of this world!! Definitely worth the calories! Don't forget to check out the pickle bar. The spicy pickles are a must try."}
{"text":"Overpriced and greasy burgers. Atmosphere is super loud and tables are way too close to each other. Wouldn't waste the $$ here."}
{"text":"Even before Michael hit it big, I enjoyed his other restaurants Lola and Lolita so I was excited to try B Spot on a visit back home.  I was not disappointed.  I had the Thin Lizzy burger.  It was delicious.  You have to pay for your sides, but you get what you pay for.  If you want cheaper pries go at happy hour.  Michael lists rules and if you haven't followed him or seen The Chew you might not understand.  Stop in, have a burger, and don't whine!  Cleveland has no room for whiners!"}
{"text":"Had the porky sandwich with a coffee milkshake. Both were so good.   Severs were very nice and attentive too."}
{"text":"Burgers, brats and Lola fries, oh my!   A homemade pickle bar!   Bad a$$ shakes!  I'm in love.   Just order a fat Doug burger, Lola fries and a vanilla bean apple pie bacon shake. Don't worry about your cholesterol. Sometimes you just need to treat yo'self!"}
{"text":"Over rated.  I've heard so many people talk about how great this place is because some celebrity chef Michael Symon) owns it.  The burgers look preformed and undersized.  You have to buy the fries seperately.  They do have a decent beer selection, if you get there after their distributer leaves.  Every time I go, they're out of my first choice of beer, and sometimes second.  I think this high-class burger joint is grossly over rated."}
{"text":"Good but pricey. Disappointed that NO variations are allowed. If you don't want it with the\"fix'ens\" go someplace else. Mr. Simon believes it's his way or the highway!"}
{"text":"Disappointing pretty much sums it up. I walked out hungry after having spent $20 on just myself. That's just unforgivable in my book.  Wait Time: You can expect a 45 minute to 1 hour+ wait regardless of which day you go to this location. Why? Well you are fighting against the \"mall crowd\" as will be evident when you enter the parking lot and see the people sitting on the curb or standing around outside the front door. If standing around doesn't suit you then you can try to jostle your way toward the bar area like I did and steal a seat if lady luck is on your side. Trying to find two seats together? Meh... forget about it and enjoy your wait.  Bar Area: If this place had one redeeming quality it would be the beer selection. I've been to quite a few bars in Cleveland but this one has my vote in terms of variety and quality of beer selection. A good healthy mixture of rare imports and tasty new selections. If they keep their taps clean over the years it's a great place to snag a beer. Only problem is that the bar is on the tiny side of things. It's hard if not impossible to find a spot due to limited space and an influx of people trying to beat the line at the door and eat at the bar.  Food Quality/Value: At $9 per burger with approval from a \"5 star chef\" *snicker* I went in expecting one of the best quality best tasting burgers in Cleveland. What I got would have trouble standing up to a meal at 5 Guys just across the street. Very average tasting burger. If it wasn't for the Balsamic Steak Sauce I would have had to ask for a refund. BLEH. Portions are tiny. Fries were shoestring tiny and bland. The $5 \"Bad*ss\" Chocolate Shake was way too thick and taste like ground up Hersheys Dark Chocolate bars.... just plain bad all around.  Staff: My first impression was not so good. It was hard to get their attention because they were so overwhelmed and flustered. I was presented with the wrong check at the end of my meal. Never in my days of eating out has this happened to me until going here. I felt bad for them in a way because this place is perpetually slammed with the mall crowd looking for a slice of gold. Seems like they aren't very well prepared for this type of crowd.  Summary: You can get a much bigger bang for your burger buck across the way at 5 Guys. Much less headache to deal with as well. Won't be back. Certainly won't bring my friends here and I will spread the warning."}
{"text":"PROS: They have an excellent beer selection and were located within walking distance of the movie theater where we were headed afterward.  CONS: Slow to be seated, slow to take our orders, slow getting us drinks, and finally slow getting us the food we ordered which came out wrong. The burgers overall were pretty basic. Nothing to write home about. Certainly didn't live up the the amount of hype the place poured into them while waiting. You can get a much better burger elsewhere at far less cost. I really can't believe Michael Symon attaches his name to this place. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Westlake! This is my second time going and the burgers aee absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"If your looking for just a burger...this really isn't your place. Though they do have a \"Plain Jane\"; Mickey D's is up the road! If Gourmet Burgers suit your palate then I highly recommend giving it a try. Great selection of beer, no reservation needed. Fries are skinny but seasoned well. Yes they cook in lard, but lets face it, if your searching for a burger...cholesterol isn't on your priority list at that point."}
{"text":"I am having a hard time understanding all the complaints about $8 for a cheeseburger.  My wife and I went to B-Spot and took my parents who were in town.  Four of us had burgers, we split two sides four ways, and we consumed at the table a total of three milkshakes and two beers.  The tab was $65.  We'd have spent more at Applebee's, but not had nearly as tasty of food.  If you read my other reviews, you'll find that I tend to be annoyed at how easily people are influenced by the shiny penny that is everything Michael Symon.  But, in this case, I think people are actually expecting too much and are too easily disappointed.  I don't know... I've heard more bad than good about B-Spot, not just here but in casual conversation, and I disagree.  Why?  My only disappointment came from the lack of size on the burger patty.  I expected 10+ ounces.  I got a very average sized burger.  And the flavor of the meat was nothing spectacular.  I mean, this is La Frieda ground beef, here... but I could do as well at Heinen's.  What made B-Spot a 4-star experience in my opinion was the composition of ingredients on the bun.  I had the Lola Burger, and the combination of bacon, fried egg, and mayonnaise was like getting hit in the face by a baseball bat of creamy richness.  But the pickled red onions cut right through that like a knife.  Oh, it was good!!!  I couldn't help but to think about Anthony Bourdain saying to that guy in that bar, \"I mean, it's a fucking BURGER!\"  But seriously, the juxtaposition of creaminess and acidity... oh, alright... I shouldn't use the word juxtaposition when describing a cheeseburger.  It was great.  It was a great combination of stuff.  There.  The Lola fries are overrated, same as they are at Lola.  The onion rings were very good, but aren't onion rings kind of a matter of opinion?  My burger had a composition of flavors and textures that was a home run.  My milkshake was one of the best I've ever had.  The beer selection and atmostphere worked for me.  The location is kind of lame.  Either way, if you're going in for a gourmet burger with toppings you wouldn't have thought of on your own (which are thoughtfully combined, I might add), I think you'll really enjoy it.  If you are going to experience Michael Symon, a self-professed meat lover just putting the biggest patty of ground beef imaginable on a buttery bun, then yeah... you'll be disappointed.  Another regular complaint is regarding the no-substitutions rule.  I agree with this rule.  It's a gourmet burger joint.  You don't go into Lola and ask for the ribeye, but instead of salsa verde, maybe a beurre blanc or a mushroom gravy.  Symon is composing unique burgers.  If you aren't into that, you aren't into that!  Finally, yes... the food all comes at once.  Just like at other burger joints.  So what?"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time because I hear that their burgers are great... And I am always on the lookout for a great burger. I must say... This experience was awesome!!   The decor is awesome. They have a wall of beer cans that's pretty cool. It was a beautiful day, so they basically had their wall open (it was like a huge garage door). Seating was comfortable, not too loud. Very nice.  Their beer selection is top notch! Lots to choose from, both on tab, or bottled. Expensive, but what do you expect for Crocker Park :)  Now for the burgers. I ordered their \"special\" which was a burger with pulled pork, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, sirachi mayo (think I spelled that wrong). My wife ordered the burger with egg and bacon. We also got an order of fries to split. (Yes... Fries DO NOT come with the burger).   Burger came out fast, and I immediately sunk my teeth into mine. It was wonderful! I order my burgers well done, and this one still came out juicy!! No one can do that right! The bun was perfect... Everything together was great overall experience.  Even with ordering fries on the side, we only spent around $30 eating here (with a beer for me). We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The word I would use is forgettable. The reason I chose that word? I looked through my Yelp check ins and realized I had been to one of the other B Spots about 14 months ago and didn't remember it. The meal today confirms that feeling. I spent $30 on the Lola burger, fries and the $11 midnight Manhattan and won't remember it a few days from now. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very special. The beef didn't taste of good quality, the fries were ok and the \"award winning\" cocktail was just fine. If you want a better experience, try Burgertory or BRGR. Same price but you will be happier."}
{"text":"Let me begin by letting everybody know my mouth started to water as soon as I started writing this review, just thinking about my dinner. My parents from AZ came to visit for the weekend, and my mom chose B Spot for dinner on Mother's Day. This request coming from somebody who doesn't like to dine out on holidays and is not much of a burger eater says a lot.  I started with the tomato blue cheese soup. It was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. I was even nice enough to share!  My dad and I split the Lola, which my brother ordered as well. The fresh beef they use for these hamburgers is out of this world. The burgers really don't even need any toppings; they just put the burgers over the top! I'm not going to lie, I regretted the choice to split my burger- I learned from my mistake and will never do this again!!   My mom decided on the Shroomage (portabella burger). Unfortunately, our server came back to let us know that they ran out of portabellas to make that burger. My mom was pretty disappointed, but she was a sport and ordered a different one. The manager later came over and told us that one was on the house.  The fries are also really good...perhaps because they are fried in lard? What makes them even better are the variety of homemade sauces you can dip them in.  Don't forget the pickle bar- lots of homemade pickles and other fun toppings/sides to have with your burgers. I definitely got my fill of pickles that night...yum!  Leave room for a shake if you can....they are delicious and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Of the three Michael Symon restaurants we've been to, this one was my favorite.   It's got a different feel than Lola or Lolita in that it's got more of a casual feel.  B-spot is a place where you can go and not make a whole evening out of it.  The beer selection is superb (roughly 50 beer choices), the burgers were above average & my bratwurst was great.  Another strong point is the pickle bar which let's you customize your entree as spicy as want it.   For as good as the burgers & brats are, the fries aren't great.  They reminded me of the shoe-string fries you used to be able to buy in a can, but warmed.  We had a couple of beers each, a burger, a brat & an order of fries & were out-the-door for $45.  Probably not worth traveling a great distance to, but definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful \"gourmet\" burgers and amazing rosemary fries. Michael Symon's name over it. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have to tell you... It's way too much meat. I got the lola burger and I was told the burger is half pound so I didn't order anything else. so my burger came and the closest thing to veggie was the onions.... when I tried to take up and bite my burger the egg broke and dripped... I don't know if I ate it right because it came with a knife and fork?"}
{"text":"Novelty burger place. Nice friendly service. Great beer selection. The menu offers not only burgers but brats,  pulled pork and bolonga sandwiches.   The burgers are cooked to order. We received our burgers cooked medium, just right! They offer some signature burgers which are between  $9 and $11. You can build your own but please understand they charge for each extra ingredient and depends on what you put on your burger, you can end up with ave $ 10 or $ 15 burger! The pickle bar was a nice addition and included in the price of your burger.    My opinion you are paying for the novelty and the location, a high end shopping center. Also, parking can be a problem due to the location too.   In conclusion, we probably won't return..been there done that!"}
{"text":"So this guy Micheal Simon is like a local celebrity or something,  an Iron chef ,whatever that means. Im told its from a reality TV show, who knows. What I do know is he makes good burgers,  1 page double sided menu, short and simple. I got the cheeseburger cuz im lame like that. and lola fries ( fries with rosemary ). I really liked it, I would have had another If I wasnt in such a hurry. Theres TAZA next door if u prefer falafel and Hummos. My attorney is upstairs on the fifth floor,  Lawyers are so overpriced for nothing."}
{"text":"We went  for a family get-together.  Since we're all bit older now we don't do gifts,  so we all meet up someplace and eat . This time its Bspot.  The place looks real neat inside and since I actually HAD a beer can collection, scanning the beer can wall was fun ....dad liked it too since he had to drink the beer so I could have the cans .  OK, enough back-story.  We all were seat and after coming straight from work, and waiting for 45 min.  I was ready to start eating the napkins !!  First thing I did, is scan the menu for something to tide us over  !!   As soon as the server came by I asked for an appetizer .....she was like, \"we don't do that, we bring it ALL out at once\"  WHAT?   I have to sit here for another 30 minutes while 12 of us to order AND then wait for it all to be cooked?  She did offer me pickles, oh yay, that's much better then a plate of cheese fries or stuffed mushrooms !!  :(     My other half and I both had a burger and they were both OK, but not worth all the hype. (or the wait)  service was OK, not great and it wasn't packed full, there was plenty of servers if they had only been a bit more attentive.  Bottom line, I WON'T be selecting it for our next outing when its my turn, and from some family feedback, its unlikely anyone else will.  For the money, I could have went to RED-Robin ...burgers are pretty much the same.  I went a few weeks ago but posted tonight after trying BURGERFI"}
{"text":"Our fav place!  Great brats-my favorite is the Clevelander with lots of hot sauce. Service is the BEST in the area. Top notch crew and managers. Craft beer selection is also the best."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great fries. Very good beer selection. One of my favorite places to eat in northeast ohio."}
{"text":"Omg this burger is soooo good! Alittle pricey but worth it! A+ all the way! Way to go Michael Simon!"}
{"text":"Unique burgers. Gluten free buns. And pickled items, oh my!  B-Spot now has gluten free buns! They aren't on the menu, but when I went to order my usual salad I decided to take a risk and ask if they had gf buns and the server replied, \"yes.\" Fully expecting a no, I almost moved on to order my usual salad order before the words registered in my head! After a thud from my dropped jaw hitting the table and pure elation spreading across my face, I then started the daunting task of picking a burger out. I got the Fat Doug and it was amazing! Meat patty was a little on the smaller, but taller size range. A little puck to a big bun, if you know what I mean. But other than that it was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Only docked it a star for not having it on their menu or anywhere online leaving us gf'ers hungry! And for the small patty puck to bun ratio."}
{"text":"Great food and pickle barrel. Everything tasted great. My burger was a little overdone but still delicious"}
{"text":"B Spot is Michael Symon's latest venture and by far his most casual. Occupying the old Cold Stone Creamery building, B Spot is located in the Eton Shopping Plaza on Chagrin Blvd.  A few things stood out to me as I browsed the decor: the open kitchen, a chandelier made of antlers, and a the wall of classic beer cans stacked in an abstract pointillism kind of way to form a giant red \"B\". Funky, casual, yet unique.   The open kitchen seems to be a common trend for Symon's restaurants. It as if he's saying he has nothing to hide. Similarly, and in the growing trend of food awareness, the menu openly states that \"we proudly serve naturally raised beef from Pat La Frieda.\" La Frieda, is a family-run meat purveyor in NYC. Further research revealed that B Spot uses a custom blend of 40 percent chuck, 40 percent sirloin and 20 percent brisket. Your cardiologist may not approve, but at least knowing the beef is bought from a trusted source, the likelihood in contracting e-coli is much less!   As you'll quickly notice on the menu, the \"B\" in B Spot stands for beer, bar snacks, big salads, bad ass shakes, burgers, bratwurst and bologna. There's no denying Symon's bias towards meat and one menu item even pokes fun of our herbivore friends. The Veggie Burger is humorously titled: \"Why??\" and offers to add bacon...\"free of charge!!\"  It's obvious Symon stayed focused on all the B's in this menu. There's nearly 40 varieties of beers to chose from, mostly craft brews. There's 16 different burgers, 5 separate bratwurst variations and 6 big salads to chose from.   To start, we just couldn't resist the $5 Shakes. In 1994 when Pulp Fiction was released, Vincent Vega would've thought we were crazy for spending as much on a shake. In 2009, I'd soon learn that $5 is an absolute steal for this Bad Ass Shake! I settled on the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow Shake and my confidant the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon Shake. Yes, mark that down for yet another new use for bacon! At first I found it a bit odd to be chewing a milk shake, but it surprisingly works.   As a side, we couldn't pass up a few orders of Lola Fries. Cooked in lard and seasoned with sea salt and rosemary, these shoestring fires are very tasty.   For dinner, we got two burgers and pretty much shared as it was just too impossible to settle on just one burger. We got the \"Philly Wit\", which was topped with flipsteak, cheese whiz & onions. The second burger was the \"Red Hot\" which was topped with with pulled pork, pickled tomato, hot peppers, pepperjack cheese & siracha mayo. Not unbearably hot, just the right amount of heat and plenty satisfying.   Overall the food and service was very good for what B Spot is. Especially considering they just opened a week or so ago. In it's early going and Symon's ever growing local Celebrity Chef status, expect a wait. We arrived on a Tuesday around 7:30pm and still had to wait 45 minutes. B Spot doesn't take reservations either, so be patient. Trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love me some Michael Simone and his menu doesn't disappoint!  Service was a 5 but Michael's delicious burgers are served in a basket on paper that shreds due to the juiciness of the burger making for an unappetizing additional topping or bottom to your burger- (free of charge though)."}
{"text":"I'm giving such a high rating cause everything was perfect. We put our name on the seating list through the yelp app @ 6:18 Friday evening. We timed it perfect as I dropped the fam off under the overhang as it was raining, and a parking spot opened up right in front of me.  Right as I walked up to the door @ 6:36, I received the text that our table was ready. Might I add we felt like we cut in line passing a dozen bodies waiting outside. Yelp app tells you how long of a wait. In our case it was 20-30 min. Also on the app I was going to request a small booth for the 3 of us but thought whatever was ready we would take because of our empty belly. Sure nuff it turns out we got the seat we wanted anyway.   Our server Nick was very prompt getting to us & getting our drink orders. He had a great positive friendly vibe and was patient giving us 2 timely tries getting a decision made on our food order.  The boy (son) went plain cheez burger as usual. The girl (wife) did the Thin Lizzy for the grilled onions. Myself (dad/husband) had to go with my favorite in the Fat Doug. Add a pickle bar and a couple sides of Lola fries and B spot has one happy booth of customers."}
{"text":"Food is inconsistent, often served luke warm. Definitely OVERPRICED for what is being served. Management is incompetent, pathetic and only looking to take money from the next fool who supports the place. If the owner had any idea of how this place was managed, he would be horrified!! Of course, he is too busy taking our money!!"}
{"text":"A great $2 cheeseburger for $7 - if you don't mind shouting to hear the person across from you and waiting to sit down. And cleaning your own table."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Burgers were delicious!  Enjoyed the fries - sea salt & rosemary on top!  Service was fast and timely.  Burgers were not huge but I liked that because I felt full but not stuffed.  Loved the 6 sauces!  My 2 year old loved the bologna burger!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers & Fries. We had 0 issues with our takeout order.  They have grilled(not fried)chicken fingers on the kids meal which is a much healthier choice for the little ones."}
{"text":"Great casual dining place. Pretty awesome burgers, but don't forget, you CANNOT and MUST NOT alter any of the ingredients on the \"named burgers.\" If you want any variations to one of those \"named burgers,\" you will need to order it under \"create your own.\" While you are there, be sure to try the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake; yes, it sounds kinda wacky, & yes, there are actual bacon bits in it, but it works & it super yummy!!! Plus, how can you go wrong w/ bacon, right?"}
{"text":"Loved the Gobbler turkey burger. The fries are super tasty, the beer is perfect and the pickles are all great. You should try them all."}
{"text":"They actually respected my request to cook my burger rare! I could almost hear it mooooo. Also: Tony. Packo's. Sweet. and. Hots."}
{"text":"First, let me say, the vanilla bean shake with Khalua and Vodka is the best desert treat ever.   My dinner was OK. I had the chili cheeseburger, Lola fries, and onion rings. The pickle \"bar\" should be called a pickle \"cart\". I was really hoping for a huge wild ass variety of pickled goodies (eggs, okra, carrots, etc.) Instead, it was pickles, onions, jalapenos, and some relish. Pretty middle of the road stuff if you ask me. However, it was all tasty with the exception of the pickles which weren't all that impressive.   The fires and onions rings were the star of the show.  The burger was tasty. The chili on the burger was pretty tasteless. No spice and no real seasoned flavor to speak of.   Would I go back? You betcha. I think there is more lurking in the menu that my one experience."}
{"text":"Second time here and the burgers are always on point.  The shakes are a bonus but I like to share since they are huge! We had the seasonal shake this time - Peanut Butter and Pretzel with Baileys Irish Whiskey."}
{"text":"Started out great, server was great and attentive but I could only give this place 1 star. All due to the fact that the manager didn't do anything to rectify this issue I am writing below and she was very rude about it all too.  First off it was my birthday today and was celebrating it here with my family. I ordered the burger special. I also ordered the vanilla milkshake and added vodka and kahlua shot to it. $9.99 for the milkshake $($6.99) Shake and $(3.00) for shot.  I got the milkshake and sipped it and I could taste not even a little bit of the shot. Manager was called over. She said that the shot was put in, didn't even believe what I said. I even had my husband taste it. Nothing. She said there was nothing she could do and that it was in there. I said there is no way and I said bring me shot so I can mix it in myself. So she did and then charges me $4 for this shot. My milkshake was more than my meal! $14 for a milkshake?!?! I will never come back here all because of an extremely rude manager and bar staff not making the Shake right in the first place. The only good thing is that the waiter apologized. Nothing from the manager!!  *Editing... as I also got food poisoning hours later! I was so sick!"}
{"text":"B Spot was great. Only issue we had was having a little plastic item in our chili cheese fries. They  took it off our bill and treated us well!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit my besties in Westlake, I ask them to please take me to the B Spot.  Their burgers are juicy and tasty!  The service was great too."}
{"text":"I know it's all the rage but honestly I was not that impressed for the $$.  The burger was ok, the pickle-relish bar was in a tight corner, and frankly kind of gross not supervised by wait staff.  The fries came in little cone cups, the servers were ok but seemed rushed and not as interested if you were not ordering alcohol from the bar---the big draw here is that you can get a beer with your burger.  Had the same meal at the B Spot near the Trader Joes - East side and not much better.  Highly over rated for the price. Much rather have Five Guys Burger and Fries in Peanut Oil."}
{"text":"First, I like burgers, I like brats, I love a good fried baloney.   Three tries, Burger, meh it's s burger. Fried baloney, not working. Brat, the onions were well carmelized, the sausage very mild. 2 stars for the protein portions of the meals.   The buns were the most memorable part of the meals. They get 3 stars  The mike guy must have a lot of friends, I've never seen so many 4-5 star reviews that were 500 very well articulated words each."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Michael Symon since seeing him win the Next Iron Chef America on Food Network!  While looking for a job, I watched The Chew everyday.  I know and love Michael.  I had been wanting to try B Spot for the longest time.  Luckily, my brother, cousin and I decided to escape the craziness of Southpark Mall before Christmas to grab lunch.  We were seated right away and looked at the menu.  I got the \"Thin Lizzy  named after Michael's wife.  My brother and cousin got \"The Inferno\".  We also got fries and onion rings to share.  Our burgers came out semi fast which was nice considering how hungry I was.  I then looked at the pickle bar which was pretty cool.  I mean they have even more than just the traditional pickles.    I also love the six different sauces to try with your burger.  I love the Lola ketchup.  It was classic ketchup with a smoky twist that I enjoyed.  The fries and onion rings were also good.  My brother and cousin also enjoyed the burgers they got.  While, I was in B Spot I forgot I was in the Cleveland suburbs and thought I was back in my old north side neighborhood of Chicago.  Thanks Michael for bringing good food and pride in our city back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I want to give it a 4. BUT the chocolate milkshake was not too good. HOWEVER, the cheeseburger was the best I had in this area. Way better than the rail. Service was great. Would have given a 4 if the milkshake delivered."}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place. Don't quite understand all of the underwhelming reviews, but then again I don't believe I've been to any of Michael Symon's other restaurants so maybe my standards aren't up to snuff anyway. Regardless, I work in the area, and when I want an excellent burger, I head here. Low-key, unpretentious and delicious may be the three best adjectives for any restaurant, and this place gets all three. Bonus points for making root beer approach drinkable in their version of the White Russian."}
{"text":"My turkey burger was almost inedible. Husbands burger was dry and tasteless. Not good. Cheap glasses and accessories.  Not worth the price at all.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not getting it!    We went there during the first month or so that they opened.  It was very \"meh\" which, as I understand it, is contemporary-speak for \"nothing special\".  The burger itself, was fully underwhelming.  I mean it's a piece of molded ground beef that's been cooked; so?  Yes there are a variety of toppings so it's kind of like the Melt or even Panini concept insofar as burger themes.  The difference, you don't get to change anything.  Don't like a certain type of cheese?  Tough.  Want a certain sauce from one burger on another?  Tough.  Want to pay a reasonable price for a small piece of meat on a factory-produced bun? Tough.  That's right, the chef known for in-house produced delights like his charcuterie served at Lola and Lolita has the buns mass-produced.  I can only assume this includes the fries.  The meat?  Bland.  No magic there at all.  Just to see if B-spot had improved since years ago, my wife coaxed me into a B-spot burger this weekend and the meat was essentially a bland \"hockey puck\" (though smaller to be sure).  In fact, I sort of found the B-spot theme amusing as I thought that the meat would have choked down better with a side order of K-Y jelly to help it actually pass down my throat.  Yes.  That dry.  I had no choice on doneness as I ordered it at the \"Q\" during a game.    The raving about the fries?  I don't get that either.  Yes, the rosemary fries served at the flagship restaurant (Lola) are awesome - a fair accompaniment for any quality meat.  The fries at B-spot are certainly not made in-house.  They are bland and rosemary-less (a word?).  They are very reminiscent of DairyQueen fries.  The fries my kids get at Wendy's lately are far superior.    And, I guess that's an important point.  A meal at B-spot is not cheap.  Our two burgers, fries and two light beers at the \"Q\" this weekend was $37.  The burgers at the non-\"Q\" locations aren't much cheaper as a typical burger is $9 without fries.  While this may be an perceived as an ignorrant comment; the burgers at Red Robin are far superior to B-spot's AND, I can customize the ingredients, AND they come with fries AND I don't feel like I've ordered from the Kremlin drive-through with Joseph Stalin on the spatula telling YOU how you want it.    I have to say I was in awe with Michael Symon's restaurant approach when I first went to now-Lolita many years ago.  The tastes, the care in preparation, the attentiveness  to food and service were wonderful.  Now, B-spot to me, is a personification of Michael Symon's newfound largess courtesy of the Food Network.  It seems his primary interest is in becoming a corporation rather than a purveryor of fine dining.  He is certainly trying to go in the direction of the likes of Wolfgang Puck or  Emeril Lagasse.  That's too bad because as it stands; B-spot would not survive in any city other that Cleveland.  I suspect in Cleveland there is a sort of devoutness to someone who began their career here and continues to evolve here.  In a competitive market like Chicago, New York not a chance.  The burgers are mediocre at best, the fries are very uniteresting, the \"rules\" are inane, and the prices are outlandish.  Indeed, $13 for a burger with fries?  Really?    In short, don't believe the hype!"}
{"text":"Yum. One of the best burgers I've had in a lot time. Those chocolate shakes? YES PLEASE! The fries are good too and the pickle bar is great. The only issue? The price - for the amount of food you get, the price seems a bit on the high side. The burger is the right size for your stomach though - not too huge that it's gross, but not too small that you don't feel satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 4 and I ordered the Lola. Overall, the burger was delicious, but honestly it's very hard to mess up a burger with a juice thick cut of burger patty and fried egg. The pickle bar is definitely worthy of an added star. However, all 4 burgers ordered were overcooked. They should be able to cook the burgers to how it's ordered for a place that specializes in only burgers. On top of that, the fries were super greasy and soft - not good. I still enjoyed the flavors of my burger, but the overall experience was just average."}
{"text":"As the latest edition to Michael Symon's mini-empire in Cleveland, B-Spot is a fantastic burger joint for anyone that likes their burgers to be a little fancy-pants.  The food here is essentially varied concoctions of sloppy burgers and associated foods served with little twists here and there.  The Lola fries are crispy with a hint of rosemary.  The burgers are cooked exactly to order and offer just the right amount of meat.  The Lola burger in particular -- stuffed with a fried egg and plenty of bacon -- is absolutely delicious and gets your hands messy.  Their shakes come in different forms -- some simple and others boasting unique combinations.  They can come regular or loaded (e.g. the chocolate shake can be blended with Kahlua) for a complete burger-fries-shake experience.  Just be aware that the wait here takes a while for big groups and requires for the entire party to be present in order to get a table.  However, the wait is worth it as this is one of the finer burger joints in Cleveland.  Kudos to you Mr. Symon.  Kudos."}
{"text":"This is a pretty simple concept.  Pretty simple menu, no frills service, and food you cannot put down.  I had the hamburger with portobello mushroom.  The only reason I stopped eating was I wanted to try the pickles and bannana peppers from the pickle bar.  They were just vinegary enough for me without being wet.  I did have to wet my palate a few times by having a sip of my \"Stormy Weather.\"  This ginger beer & rum drink had enough bite to drink with the burger and had enough sweetness to double as desert (no shake for me).  I followed the rules and had a delicious dinner, and my three person party ate and enjoyed quickly, so more people could enjoy."}
{"text":"The burgers here are REALLY GOOD, probably the best I've had in Cleveland. The price point is not bad either ($9 for a burger and $5 for hot dogs. The same burger in LA would cost me $15.)  But what REALLY bugs me about this place is 1) the service and 2) Symon's \"rules\" at the table. We went when there were plenty of empty seats, but they wouldn't seat us until the whole party was there. They do NOT take reservations and sometimes waits are as long as 50 minutes. And would it really kill them to substitute a cheese on my burger? Symon's rules are all about \"not whining\" and \"relaxing,\" but how about some customer service here? This Iron chef is getting a bit big in the head, if you ask me..."}
{"text":"The YO burger is amazing, it has a wonderful bit with the salami and burger along with the sauce that they add to it. The French fries were also tasty especially with the sauces that they have, plus they have a fantastic pickle bar."}
{"text":"TURKEY BURGER, JACK CITY BURGER, LOLA FRIES REVIEW:  My boyfriend and I visited this B-Spot location during the lunchtime hour. I ordered the \"Gobbler\"  turkey burger and asked to substitute the swiss cheese for provolone (I cant stand swiss).  The waiter kindly let me know that I would have to change my order into the \"build-your-own\" burger. Which would be about $1-$2 more than the $10 Gobbler. I hesitantly agreed to it. My boyfriend ordered the Jack City burger. The food arrived quickly, but at first bite, I knew I should have just gotten a regular burger. The turkey burger tasted literally like I was licking the grill. I'm not sure if they over cooked the patty (the bottom was rather black) or if it was just an unclean grille. The Jack City burger was very good though. The Lola fries (which do not even come with the expensive burgers, you must order them seperately) I was not a fan of. The rosemary flavor was just a bit too strong where it started tasting like I was eating soap. Needless to say, I will never order the turkey burger from there again, (although the turkey burgers are amazing at Winking Lizard if anyone cares)! :D"}
{"text":"This stop was one of the highlights on our trip and it was a great experience!   I ordered a build-your-own burger with pulled pork and Cheese Whiz.  I'd never seen Cheese Whiz on a menu before and it was a fun treat that reminded me of my childhood.  There was more pork on top of the burger than beef patty - and it was so good!!! I went with onion rings instead of fries.  They were crisp and they totally hit the spot. I also ordered a chocolate shake and it was fantastic! My husband ordered a Yo burger which had capicola and peppers.  He was most excited that there was an entire bourbon section of the menu and that we were there during happy hour.   There are six sauces (ketchup, mustard, plus four original) on the table.  They all had a bit too much kick for me but my husband thought they were all phenomenal. The decor is great.  Above the bar is a bunch of motorcycle parts and on one wall is a wall of beer cans.  It's just a lot of fun. The best part was the staff and the service.  Our server asked if it was our first visit and he took the time to explain the menu and the sauces on the table.  The manager even stopped to chat.   We're already talking about a return trip to Cleveland and it will definitely include another stop at the B Spot!"}
{"text":"The B spot has some of my favorite burgers. Where to even begin? They have so many toppings to choose from, you can get a burger pretty much any way you'd want it. Their onion rings are also really good, mKe sure to try them! The service is usually pretty good, but they're always so busy it's hard to tell whether the service is lacking or it's just normal build up due to so many orders (I think it's the latter). Anyways, if you're in town or looking for some good burgers, give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Burgers are always cooked to order unlike some smaller burger chains. I like medium rare and my burgers have always came exactly how i like them. Best thing about this place..they dont charge 50 cents for every topping that i want . Awesome service and location. Defiantly will be back!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to the B-spot!    We sat at the bar so we were able to be seated immediately.  I ordered a Simple Salad (basically a side salad) and the \"Thin Lizzy\" burger (onions, cheddar, pickles, mayo).  It took me forever to decide which burger to order because all of the options sounded so good! The salad was a good little side and the burger itself was delicious.  It was piled high with the toppings yet held together fairly well.  The meat was very good quality-- tender, flavorful and fresh.  The price point seemed pretty reasonable for most items, with burgers ranging from about $6-11 ($11 burger is a double cheeseburger).  Fries, chips, salad, etc. can be ordered a la carte for a few extra dollars.  My only slight complaint is that I did order my burger medium well and it came out bloody and barely warm in the middle, definitely more medium/medium rare.  I didn't want to be a pain in the ass and send it back, and I felt okay about eating it that way because the restaurant specializes in burgers so I am sure the meat was fresh, but I definitely would have preferred it to be at least warm in the middle, which is why I ordered it medium well to begin with.    B Spot has a great concept, good quality food, and decent service that will definitely make me a repeat customer so I can try some more of the other burgers and maybe one of their spiked milkshakes as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner before a movie. The waiter James was absolutely amazing! He suggested different beer for me to try, was very attentive and so enthusiastic. I haven't been here in quite some time, seeing as I moved a fair distance away from the area, but I remember it being so much better. Our burgers were over cooked and flavorless. The fries were good, but not work four dollars alone. We were so very disappointed. The saving grace of the experience was the service.  When the manager found out about the food she completely refunded them without any hesitation. Maybe they were just having an off day in the kitchen, but for the money I have spent there and the product I received today I will be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my third time to a Michael Symon B Spot and second time at this location.  I really wanted to like this place but each experience solidified that it just isn't the place for me.  I had previously tried the Yo! Burger and Fun Guy which were decent but nothing great compared to other gourmet burger joints I had been to. This time I decided to try the Lola Burger but asked if I could get it without the pickled onions and just regular onions. I also asked if they could add lettuce and tomato.  You'd think for $10.99 this wouldn't be a big deal but the waitress told me they can't make changes to the burgers.  What?! Are you serious? Just don't put the pickled onions on and bring me out some lettuce tomato and onion and I'll put it on myself if it's too difficult for the cook.  Of course I stated this a little more politely but I was thinking this is ridiculous. She said she would have to ask her manager if they could do that.  All I'm saying is that if you offer a build your own burger for $7.99 then anywhere from .49-$1.99 per topping I think you can remove one topping and give me some lettuce, tomato and onion.  Now I've tried the Lola Fries before and wasn't that impressed and they cost me an additional $3.99. I'd be alright with this if they weren't basically frozen shoestring fries with a sprinkling of rosemary.  Something like that should come with the burger.  There was nothing great about these fries imo.  So this time I got the Pork Cracklings which were still $2.99 extra but better than those fries.   I opted not to get a shake this time but on my previous trip I got a Pumpkin Pie Shake which was the best thing I ever had from B Spot. I'll give them credit there.  Even at $6.99 for a shake, it was worth it I admit.  So the food comes out about 20 minutes later but I never did get an answer about my request. When my food is presented it has the lettuce, tomato and onion on the side and the waitress tells me that her manager was too busy to ask so she just brought it out but that I'd have to take the pickled onions off the burger myself.  Wow!  You are telling me that the cook \"had\" to put them on?! What that means to me is that these burgers are pre made and heated up. How on God's green Earth can't you remove a single item. Especially if I'm paying $10.99 for just the burger!    The Shasha sauce (mustard), Lola Ketchup and Coffee BBQ sauce on the tables are all pretty good stuff. They had a pretty decent craft beer selection which had Three Floyds featured so I grabbed one at a normal bar price.  There is the complimentary pickle bar which is an interesting touch. You can get kimchi, pickled onions, green tomatoes and a few types of pickles including my favorite, Tony Packo pickles!  That was a welcome surprise but not enough to make up for what I didn't like.    Speaking of, my main complaint is the price you are paying for what you get. To order a burger, fries and shake you are looking at over $20 before tax and tip.  You are paying for the Michael Symon name and that is all. I'd rather pay good money for a meal made by Michael Symon and not some random guy in the back following such a blueprint that they can't take off and item from a burger.    The burger wasn't bad but smaller than most gourmet burger restaurants. The fries are nothing special and came at an additional cost. Pork Cracklings were decent but again an additional cost. The milkshakes are the real star but come at a premium of $6-$7. The staff hide behind ridiculous rules. Pickle bar was a plus along with the sauces to bolster the tasteless fries.  But ultimately everything was far overpriced and I don't like the attitude towards patrons who are throwing down this kind of money. There are better options at half the price. But hey, I ate a Michael Symon burger.  I'd come back if I was asked or maybe just for a shake but I wouldn't pick it myself anymore."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointing - every time I go to bspot the menu is smaller with less - and more BYO.  Wings are off the menu now, it seems like the menu here is dying a slow death.  Flip side is better in my opinion, so are a lot of other burgers in town - most are better."}
{"text":"I don't want to waste further time on this place.  Here's why I'm giving it one star:  1.  1 hour wait for a table at a mall on a Sunday for a mediocre burger.  2.  I ordered my burger rare.  To them, this apparently means well-done, because it was waaaaaay overcooked.  My SO's was over-done too.  3.  This restaurant makes it very clear that to them, the kitchen, not the customer, is always right.  So, you may only take items off your burger, not add something on or substitute.  How pretentious and unfriendly.  This place needs to get over itself and realize that different people like different combinations on their burger, and a GOOD restaurant humors those requests.  4.  The bun was bland, gooey, and unappealing.  5.  Everything between the bun (overcooked burger, cheese, bacon, fried egg) was tasteless.  Really tasteless.  Very surprising.  I make much more flavorful, unique burgers at home.  6.  No avocado on any burger???  REALLY?????  7.  I appreciate a fried egg with a gooey center as much as the next girl, but this fried egg had a RAW center that was liquid.  Gross.  If that's the latest hipster foodie trend, count me out.  And unless they offer a warning on the menu about the dangers of eating raw eggs, they shouldn't serve a raw egg.  8.  The waiter acted like he was doing us a favor and was very impatient.  Dude, I waited an hour for this freakin' table.  You can take a moment, breathe, and wait for me to order at a normal pace.  9.  We weren't sitting IN the restaurant, so much as outside of it, and in the mall's center.  Um.  Tacky.  It was like eating in a mall foodcourt.  10.  Here's the most annoying thing about this place (which was overall pretty annoying).  The website actually states, \"No Whining! We will do our very best to make everyone happy. Just like line jumpers at an amusement park, whiners will be prosecuted & removed from the establishment. Life is short, have fun & enjoy the moment.\"  Um, dude, your place isn't so special that people can't complain if the food is over/under-cooked, the service stinks, and the burger's tasteless.  No need to intentionally antagonize your customers with stupid \"rules\" about how they should act in your MALL RESTAURANT.  Seriously, have some manners, get some class, and remember: The customer is ALWAYS right.  This is how you will stay in business past your 15 min of fame on the Food Network.  I'm tired of celeb \"chefs\" opening hipster restaurants that brag and boast about how fabulous their own food is, charge more than they should, have long waits with mediocre to bad service, and the food they produce never measures up to everything advertised.  I'm just tired of it.    I'm not EVER waiting an hour for a table at a burger joint again.  Really.  I don't care if the burgers come gold-plated and promise to do my laundry.    B Spot is a mediocre burger restaurant.  It CERTAINLY isn't worth the hype or the wait."}
{"text":"I had one meal here and would not return.  There is nothing special about the burger and I thought it was a bit high priced for nothing special.  I found the wait staff as robotic as a corporate burger barn and un-attentive.  There are many places in town for a better burger."}
{"text":"After getting a good hike in near Westlake, we headed over to Crocker Park to grab some groceries and lunch. I had been hearing about B Spot Burgers for a while, so we decided to stop in for burgers and fries.  We sat outside on the patio on a gorgeous summer day. I ordered the turkey burger with all the fixin's while my other half ordered a juicy, beefy burger. We also ended up ordering a side of fries with ROSEMARY seasoning.   The burgers were fantastic. Full of flavor. They have their own pickle bar, so you can go grab a plate of your favorite pickled foods (I got tons of kimchi and onions) to put on your burger. NOW TO THE FRIES. Being an amateur chef myself, I love experimenting with flavors. I've never heard of rosemary on fries, but OMG - These fries were to die for. I didn't even need any dipping sauce because they were so flavorful with just the rosemary and salts.   Great spot overall. I need to get back."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BURGER! Also favorite milkshake: chocolate banana marshmallow. God's tears in a cup. Love their fries also and the general atmosphere. One of my top favs"}
{"text":"A lot of expertly crafted hype, marketing and well planted PR. Food is nothing special."}
{"text":"I came here while I was in Cleveland for work based on a recommendation and I can't say that I was impressed. The menu was pretty limited and none of the main courses came with sides.. I get that it's a burger place, but there isn't much else they have to offer. Incidentally I ordered a salad. There were barely any leaves but it had a million toppings, so it wasn't very balanced and honestly just wasn't that good. The atmosphere is also unoriginal and felt like I was in an airport. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty. I have been twice and have enjoyed my meal both times. I absolutely love their Lola fries. So light and yummy with the rosemary. I got the turkey burger once and the Chick Magnet sandwich once. Both were really good. Love the location in Crocker Park. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Walking in was not a great experience for us. We weren't greeted or given a wait time. It seemed to me the hostesses were having more fun talking with each other then seating people who were hungry. Then we asked how long and was told 20 minutes so we went to the bar. Almost immediately our buzzer went off. Went to turn our buzzer in and our host walked away without us and then shook his hand at us when he got to the table to follow. Before we were both seated he walked away without saying a word. Our server was great, was always smiling, around when we needed but also gave us our time. Food was great!! It's hard to say if I'd return. Great food or a bad attitude from the front!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers...they offer a great variety and several unique combinations! Fries are a must - very tasty and crisp!"}
{"text":"Anything from Michael Symon never dissapoint, B Spot included. I usually go with the Fat Doug or a Brueben, and they are always phenomenal. Great on tap beer selection, even including a few great ciders. I douse my onion rings and fries in the Coffee BBQ sauce. Yum."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and decided to return recently for lunch with a friend. We both really enjoyed our food!  The restaurant has indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. The middle of the restaurant has a large bar area. The interior is kind of industrial and very clean. Most of the tables are large, comfortable booths with tables in the middle of the dining area.  Our waitress provided great service during our visit. She was friendly, refilled our waters often, and checked in on us a few times. Our food was prepared pretty quickly as well.  The menu mainly features burgers, shakes, hotdogs, and sides. There are some great burger combinations to choose from which made it hard to decide. The shake options are also very tempting with alcoholic shake options too.  My friend and I both went for the Lola Burger which is a beef burger with egg, bacon, pickled onions, and cheddar cheese. It really hit the spot for my burger craving and I enjoyed every last bite. My friend also thought it was a delicious cheat from her usual healthy diet. Both burgers were cooked as we requested. They were a bit greasy so we had to eat fast. We also shared Onion Rings and Lola Fries. The onion rings were great and tasted like there was beer in the batter. The fries of course were crispy and had the perfect amount of rosemary flavor."}
{"text":"I just started working across the street from Crocker Park and decided to give B Spot another try. I had to dock two stars. I was hoping it was just my first visit but the food is just sooo underwhelming and disappointing.   I got the New Jack City this time. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't great and when I'm paying $12 for a burger, I want it to blow me away. The meat lacks any flavor at all. It's not a great burger and it's not a huge quantity, so what's with the price?   Every time I go to B Spot, I always leave with the unsatisfactory feeling of \"why did I spend $12 on THAT?\"  I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"I get the Yo burger or the Fat Doug.  Rosemary fries are good and the pickle bar is a nice touch.  My son ordered the bratwurst- I tried it and it was very plain and uneventful.  Cheap beer lovers...they sell PBR in a tall boy!!!"}
{"text":"Holy pretentious! What is up with rules, burger fascists?   ...They only seat complete parties--heaven forbid I should use up one of your precious tables while I wait for my friends.   ...All the food comes out at once--who wanted appetizers anyway?   ...You have a condiment bar but nobody in the restaurant is willing to give me a plate to drop some condiments on? Really? I can't have a plate?   ...Oh yeah, I almost forgot, you think your menu is holy scripture. Wtf, even Burger King allows me to have it my way. And I think I'd rather eat there than your burger fascist restaurant.  Ok, so yeah, the burgers are fine, but I refuse to be treated like a less than human to partake. Fine, I'll follow your last rule and not wine. I'm out.  P.S. the service was crap too."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet....  Michael Symon's burger place is a decent option if you are in the area.  The burger patties themselves taste pretty good, and the burger meat is cooked very well.  The Lola burger is a very typical burger to order, and the fried egg is a nice touch.    That being said, last time I went to B Spot I decided to try something different, and got the Porky.  The burger was awfully dry and tasted like sandpaper.  I downed two glasses of water but couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"I've never been super impressed by B Spot. I like it well enough--local celeb chef, quality ingredients, good burgers and fries--but it's never been something that I actually go out of my way for. The Lola burger is tasty, the pulled pork is good, the beer list is decent, and the fries are not bad. But it's the pretension, more than anything, that kills me.   Every burger is, to some degree, pink in the middle, and to ask for anything else is just shy of blasphemy. Everything is a tad too expensive--I can forgive the $9 burger, but $4 for a cup of rosemary fries is too steep. The atmosphere is striving for gastro-chic, while battling a usual crowd of patrons that seem like they couldn't get a table at Red Robin.  I'd never refuse to go to B Spot again, but it will rarely be at the top of my list for places to eat."}
{"text":"A hamburger joint where the philosophy of management is that the \"customer is always wrong.\"  Try to get a variance of anything here. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This is the place people that want a good burger need to go.  There is the simple cheeseburger, and it escalates from there. My favorite, the Philly Wit, along with a couple others, were taken off the menu but replaced with some other tasty burgers (the Bambino, for example). I've been to all 3 B Spot locations and can honestly say only good things about all of them. The quality and taste of the burger cannot be beat. I've tried other burger places around Cleveland and B Spot is still the winner."}
{"text":"I come here for the happy hour and stay for the burgers.  Happy hour beer, $3 drafts feature a great selection of beers for a great price.  Plus the $1 fries!  They don't provide a plate or bowl for you to put any of the sauces, so you're left to use a paper towel for sauces unfortunately.  But the sauces go so well with the fries and burger. Happy hour was better when they had $5 burgers as well but that changed and now there's a slight discount on sliders."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at B Spot. The food is always great and the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Parking is plentiful as well. I recommend trying the New Jack City or the Yo!  If you are complaining about the price, you should seek financial help, because you have some issues. The wait time is acceptable, especially considering how busy the place usually is."}
{"text":"Oh Michael Symon, you god amongst gods... This is the burger place that no one else has made yet???? How is that possible. It's just a burger place, but somehow, so much more. If you're only going once:  order the Lola burger, porky fries and the apple pie-bacon milkshake.  These you will not taste anywhere else. Lola burger has the thick and crunchy bacon, cheese and over easy egg on top.  (the egg is meant to break open and coat the burger) Porky fries are pulled pork and cheese whiz.. Better than it sounds.. Over fries.  And then the shake.  Just try it! The pickle bar adds to it all.  And then the sauces:  Lola ketchup, coffee BBQ, etc. If I had to get picky, I'd say that the bottom of the fries or sandwiches can get too wet from all of the toppings and juices, but that's what makes them special in the first place."}
{"text":"The premise of B-Spot is obvious, handcrafted all natural ingredients combined with an eccentric take on traditional classics. However, the last 2 times I have left sick and/or disappointed. The burgers are good, sandwiches are decent, but everything is fairy pricey. The real kicker are the outstanding shakes, such as the apple pie bacon or marshmallows banana chocolate. Everyone seems to rave about B-Spot, but I am very reserved about it. The food is ok if a little over priced. Good place, fun atmosphere but doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Too big for it's britches. When we arrived for a late lunch there were literally 10 employees at the reception desk and we were ignored till they had finished their business- about 5 minutes. They could not even be bothered to acknowledge us. The food was ok but kind of soggy and our trendy waiter treated us as if we were to old to appreciate the restaurant. He was probably right."}
{"text":"I'm a Food Network fan, so when I hear celebrity chef restaurant, I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame. Cleveland isn't necessarily known for its cuisine, but thanks to Iron Chef Michael Symon, that might be taking a turn for the better. If traveling on a budget and the idea of eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant worries your wallet, never fear. Chef Symon has the perfect place for you - B-Spot Burgers. With multiple locations, we ended up at the one located in a upscale mall plaza. (For you Chicagoans, very similar to Bolingbrook's Promenade).   B-spot Burgers is known for just that, great burgers. Skip the line though and just hit up the bar. Quicker service and better ambience. The feel of the restaurant is very modern meets garage sale. A large B is outlined on the wall made entirely of beer cans, fake antler chandeliers hang above the tables of dark wood, and the house is bustling. Reasonable prices and if you get there in time for Happy Hour, you'll be even happier with the price.   Michael Symon has multiple restaurants throughout Cleveland including more upscale ones such as Lolita and Lola. To try to get a feel for these, I opted for the Lola Burger. Burger with fried egg, bacon, pickled red onions, cheddar and mayo with a side of Lola fries. No big frills, just a good burger. They give you a nice option of 6 sauces to choose from on the table which I find interesting and fun. I enjoyed having said I've been to one of Chef Symon's restaurants but it's nothing too out of the ordinary. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely eat there again and did enjoy it, but it's not \"get in the car, we're driving 6 hours back to Cleveland\" kind of place.    If you want the novelty of eating there, I suggest you go. It's a good burger from an Iron Chef and that's good enough for me."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at the B Spot was just as good as the 1st! Couldn't resist getting the Lola burger again, it's just soo good! Lola fries are great, and a plain old chocolate shake was crazy good. Will be back again and might try the Fat Doug, it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"The burger's here are fantastic, and at an average of 7 dollars a pop, you can't get much better than this for the creativity.  The rest of the menu is so tempting, it's hard to stray away from the sandwiches to stay focused on the burgers.  I've heard the shakes are great (even though i've never tried one) and the pickle bar is a fantastic idea.  The rosemary fries were delicious, and with a small cut, a fair amount of fries goes a long way.  Get there early, because it gets busy quick!"}
{"text":"The food was good and it came out really fast. But the burger was tiny for the price and the waiter never came back to see if we were happy with our food. Beer was awesome but I wasn't impressed. Next time I'll just go to melt."}
{"text":"Michael Symon didn't get where he is without great talent and insight. B Spot serves burgers with distinctive flavor, great bread and exceptional fries. (Don't forget Lola ketchup.) During Lent, they serve one of the most delicious fiah fries you'll ever sink your teeth into. Wish it was on the menu all the time. Add to that a nice selection of brews and you have a place I like to return to as often as possible. Be prepared to find B Spot packed."}
{"text":"Well I am posting this before leaving the restaurant. This place is over priced. My sons meal is $5.99 with fries and a drink. Great price. My meal was $10.99 and I got nothing but the burger.  .  The fries are way over priced for shoe string fries. I am disappointed. I looked forward to coming here. My burger came out undercooked. Please see the pics.  The burger is smaller than a McDonald's burger. The taste was bland.  I gave it two starts because my sons meal was good he said. I will prob not come back.  For me to come back I need to have a coupon. And I know there won't be any coupons."}
{"text":"David and I went on a Saturday.  The place was hopping.  The food was amazing.  I had the Lola.  Who knew that an egg on a hamburger would be so good.  The onion rings were amazing.  The service was a little lacking but they were very busy.  We will definitely make the hour trip to Strongsville the next time we're in the mood for burgers."}
{"text":"Went here before a movie at the nearby movie theater. I ordered the atomic and it was freaking delicious. The fries are to die for and the shakes are SO TASTY. I would eat here every week if I lived closer."}
{"text":"B Spot is the only Michael Symon restaurant that I have ever been to, and I've been to there a number of times when visiting family in Cleveland.  It's a nice casual dining spot that has a great beer list.  It's great to grab a bite to eat while out shopping or before going to see a movie because it's located in a very convenient location in Strongsville.  I don't eat meat, and they used to have a great portobello sandwich, but when I was in over the holidays, I discovered that they have replaced it with a veggie burger.  I definitely preferred the portobello sandwich, but the veggie burger is good too.  The last time I was there I ordered it on a Zorbo salad, which was a great way to go.  Often times I leave B Spot too full and feeling like I didn't eat a really healthy meal because I can never resist ordering onion rings or fries.  The time before that I created my own burger and got it with caramelized onion, avocado, and Sriracha mayo.  It was delicious, but I ate way too many fries like I always do.  They also have a great variety of BBQ sauces at all of the tables.  I never fail to take a trip to the pickle bar, which is a really nice touch.  I love that they have such a vast selection of beer and were even carrying a local Charlottesville beer from Blue Mountain.  B Spot is definitely the most accessible of the Michael Symon restaurants, and I'll be back on future trips to Cleveland."}
{"text":"While on a visit to Cleveland, my brother and I stopped into B Spot at Crocker Park for dinner.  We sat at the bar and the service was awesome!  I had been to B Spot one other time but in Strongsville.  I ordered the same thing I got last time, the Why?, with goat cheese.  It was delicious!  The bun wasn't soggy which normally happens with portobello burgers.  I also had a side of onion rings. YUM!  There are all sorts of great sauces to put on your burger or your onion rings.  I tried almost all of them!  They also have a pickle bar which I didn't visit on this visit, but it is another nice touch."}
{"text":"Over priced, nothing to justify the fact that its a burger joint. The fries shared the same frier as their \"bologna\" fried sandwiches, meaning they came out horrrrible."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the brats.  We enjoy homemade brats frequently from a local butcher shop that made these taste like something you would buy at the grocery, vacuum packed, with the horse and wagon logo on the front.  Decided to give it another try given the fact that it as a Symon restaurant, but was again disappointed in the burgers."}
{"text":"I was at the Crocker Park B Spot and order the Funguy burger and a softdrink. I wanted the blue cheese switched out for provolone cheese. I had to wave done the server for pop refills and when the burger came out, there wasn't any provolone cheese and when I looked under the bin when I didn't taste the provolone, I saw blue cheese crumbs. The cook must have just brushes off the cheese and forgot to put the correct piece on. I called over the server and he said I could have the burger removed from the bill, New burger or he could bring out a slice of cheese. I chose the latter. I felt the food was over priced. $3.99 for fries? Give me a break. I did not order that. They corrected things but the server was slow to refill but quick to get us out of the restaurant. I felt he was pushy. Then the artwork... Most was fine but one picture stood out and really annoyed me. The picture of a cow dressed as a pope was a crude joke at best. Being someone brought up Catholic, this painting was in bad taste, if not downright offensive. I do not plan going back. There are too many other burger places that taste better, better service, better priced and do not put up low class \"art\"."}
{"text":"Showed up at this place as a fluke, we were in the neighborhood. We were pleasantly surprised to find out it was Michael Symon's place. My fiance and I like to try out Iron Chef restaurants. First off, we loved the decor, recycled Harley parts, reclaimed hardwood walls and a wall of every beer can you could think of in the world. The service was great and we got our food in a timely manner. First off the pumpkin pecan shake was to die for, like pumpkin pie in a glass. Highly recommend! I got the special which was a burger with chorizo and cheese on it. I liked it and it was super juicy, but I would have like more of a chorizo taste. My man got the shroom burger and that burger was goooood! There was a whole portabello on there. We also got a side of chili cheese fries (okay as is, but exceptional with the added sauces). Our fav sauces were the lola ketchup? and the yellow sauce that wasn't a mustard. YUM!!! I guess the prices were a little steep ($9-$12 for a burger) but I would definitely go back! It's worth it!!"}
{"text":"My first experience of B Spot was over a year ago. At the time I wasn't yelping, so I never wrote a review! I do remember my first time being just mediocre. I ordered the Lola burger I believe, and remember thinking \"okay\" as I ate it. If anything I loved the fries. BUT, I just recently returned to B Spot for dinner. I had to pick between this or Paladar, so I thought why the heck not, let's give it a second chance!  My second experience was much tastier than the first (granted, I am not a huge burger person). I ordered a BLT this time around with an egg. Oh my god. So much bacon! Such a big sandwich! Yummy runny yolk! Oh, and I really love bacon! So, I am an advocate for all non-burger loving people to go to B Spot and try the alternative items on the menu that don't involve ground beef. Furthermore, the individual I went there with loved their burger that had a turkey patty. More reason for me to go back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant a couple of times on my trips to Cleveland, and every time I never leave disappointed.  I decided on this trip to make sure I had a Michael Symon kind of day and decided to try two of his restaurants, making this my first stop.  The burger I had was incredibly tasty and well cooked to perfection.  The Lola Fries are a must to go along with anything you order.  The service was quick on this trip and made for a very timely lunch experience.  Definitely a must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger anywhere.  We eat here on a regular basis, and have always received consistently good, well prepared, juicy burgers. The prices can't be beat for the quality of the beef used.  Leave your worries at the door regarding ground meat, because this is tar-tar quality beef - you could eat it raw.  The best part is the happy hour specials, where the prices are crazy low.  Excellent selection of tap beers, too.  Love, love, love."}
{"text":"First visit but not my last!! Laid back atmosphere and a nice, attentive server! I ordered a delicious Lola burger!! Our table shared the pulled pork fries !They were good and the pork was abundant!!   Love the coffee barbecue sauce and the pickles!!        Im a fan of all things Micheal Simon and I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was happy to try this joint, as I was a big fan of Bar Symon (rest in peace). This place does a lot of things right, but it's not fantastic. The first of my quibbles is the high-volume style of the service, which is designed to turn tables and reduce waits, not for a reasonably paced meal. They won't seat you unless your entire party is with you, then they grab empty plates and glasses with an alacrity that suggests guests are inconveniences once they've wolfed down their meals. Don't get me wrong - I understand why they do it, but it sucks. Symon can follow his \"rules\" but I don't have to like them all. The food is pretty good overall. Burgers are solid, but not the best in town as some have claimed. Portions are substantial, particularly on the a la carte sides. The Lola fries are great, though the massive portion of onion rings was a bit heavy on batter and light on crunch. The pulled pork was a bit of a disappointment - it was bland and a bit too wet. The beer selection is more than respectable. The milkshakes are rich and delicious. For me, it adds up to a solid three stars. I'll go back, but only if it's not crowded and only if I'm in a hurry to eat like a starving jackal."}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was going to be like \"Killer\" good, but it was just ok. Though they did a great job with my burger without a bun - the burger itself just didn't have the hopeful flavor I thought it would.  The fries were really good though - price was ok, parking was ok and service was ok! Not a whole lot to mention here, but I'd surely go back!"}
{"text":"got there a couple minutes b/4 11:30am on a Sunday .. which is when they open .. the doors were wide open so we thought it was ok to walk in .. got SHOUTED at by a very nasty person from the wait staff that they were NOT open .. so I pretty much told her to chill out & we would wait .. thankfully the service once we were permitted to enter was much better .. our waiter was friendly & attentive .. first time here & the burgers we ordered did not disappoint .. I prefer my burgers medium rare & only order them at a place I am told specializes in burgers or they are way too raw .. both turned out perfect in terms of temperature .. split an order of fries to give them a try .. next time we will opt for the onion rings .. as they wafted to others seated near us we were immediately jealous we did not have an order also grace our table .. NEXT TIME .. also want to try the brats on a future visit & perhaps a root beer float .. but note to the wait staff .. a kind \"sorry but we are not open yet\" would have sufficed vs the verbal assault we got .. we nearly turned around & left .."}
{"text":"Our goto burger place more becuase of how close it is then how great it is. The food is generally 4 stars and they have a pickle bar which is awesome, although our last trip there seamed to less variety. I have tried most of the burgers on the menu and they are all very well done and have great flavor. The lola fries are awesome and the onion rights i believe have crack in the batter. My biggest issue is the service. The manger tends to sit on the inside patio and crunch numbers all day(ive seen this multiple times) and the staff seems very unorganized. I cant tell if they have food runners, or if some of the staff works hard to make up for the incompentace of others but this last visit went as follows... sat almost instantly. 10 minutes to get waited on. we ordered water and drinks...the drinks, which had to be made came first... Then 10 minutes later we ordered our food, and water again as it never showed. Our food came out in average time. After we ate, it took another 15 minutes to track our waitress down to get the check... we will be back.. but only because they are close, and have good food...  not for the service."}
{"text":"I like to take my assistant out for lunch a couple times each month, and with the weather being gorgeous today, we decided to go somewhere with outdoor seating.  We headed to Eton shopping center, tried unsuccessfully to find a parking spot near the restaurant with salads and sandwiches, and subsequently parked in the eastern portion of the lot.  Got out of the car, started hoofing it toward the salad place, and . . . the aroma of burgers compelled us to B Spot.  There was a table with an umbrella outside, so OK, today we have burgers;  we can have salad another day.  I have dined at B Spot several times in the past and been underwhelmed by the food (it's never been bad, but there are other burger jernts aplenty). The service, though, has been good each time.  Service today was again appropriately attentive, and Joe was also personable;  I would ask to be seated at one of his tables in the future.    Another server arrived, and setting an order of Lola fries on the table, asked which of us had ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  Mmm, not our order, and despite the fries not having been touched, she had to leave them with us.  We munched a few (and tossed a couple to the birds that had been waiting in anticipation);  they were hot and yummy, with no ketchup needed (imo).  I constructed my own burger (last visit, I don't remember this being an option), and my assistant chose the New Jack City -- she was VERY happy with her burger, with the chorizo, avocado, green chili, roasted red pepper, and pepper jack cheese.  We shared an order of onion rings;  I am partial (very) to the rings at Yours Truly, but these were great.    Salt and pepper, a roll of paper towels, and condiments are on each table.  Regular ketchup, yellow mustard, stadium mustard, shasha sauce, Lola ketchup, and coffee bbq sauce (which my assistant really liked, and used on her burger and some of the fries).  Glad we followed our noses today."}
{"text":"Solid burgers.  Amazing wings.  Wish I lived closer so I could go to happy hour.  The wait to be seated on a Friday night was almost an hour, but I was happy I waited. I ordered the New Jack City burger, the Lola fries, and the garlic parmesan wings.  Unlike many bars, B spot does not offer fifteen different varieties of wings - only 3 choices available here.   There isn't even the traditional hot wings option (the other choices are sriracha and lime & cilantro).  But wow, the garlic parmesan wings were really good!   I liked them better than the wings I've been eating at wing nights in several other establishments.  My burger was great.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh and combination of chorizo sausage, roasted red peppers, and avocado went together on the burger really well.  I've had the Fat Doug in the past and it was also really good.  I prefer thicker cut fries, so the Lola fries weren't my favorite - but the burger and wings were so good I didn't really care.  If you don't go to B Spot during happy hour, you'll run up a slightly more expensive tab than usual for a burger and fries.  But with the quality of food you're getting, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went in with my wife and brother-in-law and had a great experience. We all had burgers and milkshakes, all we needed were hammocks for a nap lol great food and great service. Recommended 100%."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try B Spot for my birthday - we love Michael Symon and thought this would be a fun night out.  Well, to begin with, we asked to be seated inside as it looked like rain - and we ended up at a table in the MALL.  Yes, it was adjacent to the restaurant, but seriously, it had all the atmosphere of a food court.  Wait staff was quick to take our order, and the key thing here is to remember that arriving between 3 and 6pm (happy hour) means all burgers are $5 (except the make your own burger!).  Considering that they were pretty busy, the food came out quickly, but missing one order of Lola fries (shoestring fries with rosemary).  I'm not a fan of rosemary, so personally I think they would have been awesome without it, but for me they were just okay.  My son got the onion rings which were really good - next time I'm ordering those.  My big issue started here.  First, in the menu it was \"Don't forget the pickle bar!\" and the wait staff was all \"don't forget the pickle bar!\" so I wanted to try it.  I get up and walk back into the restaurant and had to stand there for quite some time before I could even find it.  We are talking a dinky little food service cart that held 8 little crocks (and it wasn't even 8 different types of pickles, some were duplicates).  On top of that the cart was right up against tables and I couldn't even get to one side of it without seriously disrupting people who were eating.  And the selection?  Pickled onions, pickled peppers, banana peppers, sweet pickle chips and garlic dill pickle chips.  That's it.  Really sad.  Back at the table, my son was eating his Atomic Burger - ghost chili pepper, jalapeno peppers, habanero sauce, and pepperjack cheese.  After just a few bites he had drained his soft drink.  After searching around for our waiter, and having to flag him down to ask for a refill, we then waited, and waited, then watched him bring a nearby table a glass of wine.  THEN he had the nerve to walk up to our table empty handed and ask if he could get us anything!  Seriously, if you know that someone at one of your tables ordered this burger, a refill should have come out with the order!  End of the day, meal was okay, glad I got it so cheap as I would have been upset if we had had to pay full price.  Will I go back? No, food isn't good enough to want to eat in a mall and suffer bad service."}
{"text":"Love, Love Love this place! Everything from the layout to the service and food (great beer selection too).   I had the Yo! burger with fried salami, coppa, hot peppers, provolone, shasha hot sauce the 2011 winner best burger in america by SOBE wine & food festival.  Other burgers won 2010 and 2012.  The burger was amazing as were the signature sauces and pickle bar.  The onion rings were better than ok.  Next time, rosemary fries...  When in the area I will return"}
{"text":"Minus one big star for stupid, inflexible polices. No one, not even a non-present chef/owner tells me what I like on my food. You cannot substitute anything on anything here. Take it off, sure, but add something?  For shame to even try. I don't know much about this Symon guy but that just seems dumb. I wasn't trying to do anything crazy, I just don't like bleu cheese much, but prefer other kinds.   Another policy - everything must be ordered at once. Which means appetizers come out at the same time as meals. Uh. Ok.   The burgers, while tasty, are small and do not come with fries. Do.Not.Come.With.Fries. One of my fellow diners had a brat and decidedly loathed it. Everyone was MEH about the burgers.   However, the chili fries? Amazing. The chips with rosemary fondue? Probably the best thing I ate all week. Freshly cooked and warm, I was in heaven for that bit of time.   Beer selection is good, and they nicely warn you if it's draft or can.   Again though, I don't to go places to be told how to eat so overall, so-so."}
{"text":"Okay...that \"B\" stands for beer, brats, burgers. The 'B' should stand for more than that.  The other \"B\" should be for BOOZE! The B-Mary at B-Spot is B-yond B-lief! I've had the B-Mary at the original B-Spot, the new Strongsville location does that drink proud. Nice to see such consistency....you can B-lieve I'll be checking the ones at Crocker Park when that location opens up next month.   We started out with B-runch drinks and proceeded to the next \"B\", burgers.   The kid and I both had the Red Hot Burger....one huge B-eautifully done B-urger piled with succulent pulled pork, pepperjack cheese, pickled tomatoes (YUM!), siracha mayo and jalapenos...B-ig taste that tickled all our fancies.  I took my own gluten-free bun so I could enjoy it as it was meant to B....B-tween a B-un as God intended.  Our server was happy to accomodate my request and brought everything to pile on my own B-un...good service!    The hubster ordered the Fat Doug...one of the classics by which the B-Spot has B-uilt its reputation.  Now the hubby is a hard man to please - nothing much excites or impresses him when he's out.  I guess I spoil him with the homecooking...and he happily enjoys the spoiling.  His Fat Doug was yet another B-eautifully done medium rare B-urger B-rimming with its load of pastrami, coleslaw and Swiss cheese.  He declared it one of the B-est B-urgers he can recall!  What was for dessert you say? Dessert consisted of a Stormy Weather, B-Spot's version of a Dark and Stormy. Absolutely the B-est version I've ever had. Sweet, spicy, limey with a stick of sugar cane as a stirrer...fun to chew upon while sipping away happily. I don't think I'd ever hit the B-Spot without finishing off with one of these again.  B-Spot.  B-there!"}
{"text":"Michael Symon puts out fine food at Lola and Lolita in Cleveland, he definitely knows how to make a damned good burger.  Well, that's not news since his Fat Doug burger was voted #1 burger in the country, even beating out the likes of Bobby Flay.  I can attest it was the best burger in my tummy, too!  The burger was cooked to perfection, juicy, tender, bursting with flavorful beef, topped with a pile of pastrami, oozing melted Swiss cheese, and crisp crunchy coleslaw.  BIG burger!  Added a side of Lola fries which are fried in lard - who knew what lard does for fries?!  I didn't, but it will be hard to find a better fry....dusted with sea salt and rosemary...mmmmmm.    Oh!  How did I forget?!  I started the meal with one of the best Bloody Marys anywhere!  This is one original B Mary....even has homemade Lola ketchup in it...don't turn up your nose, you...try it and you'll be a believer, too.  Of course, Lola ketchup bears no resemblance to my beloved Heinz....and I thought I'd never love another ketchup but Heinz....until now....sorry hometown Heinz, you'd love it too.  In fact, my dining companion liked my B Mary so much she ordered one for our next round.  The atmosphere is casual, even has a pickle bar in the middle to help yourself to some interesting extra toppings like sweet hot pickles, hot peppers, etc.....remember going to Roy Rogers and their fixins bar?  Yup...the gourmet version....very cool, fun little extra.  In fact, the pickle bar kind of represents the whole place to me...cool, fun, casual, friendly, excellent quality and someplace I'll go back to....frequently when I'm in Cleveland.  Oh...and next time I'll save room for a kickass milkshake, too."}
{"text":"Well....some people may not like this review. I am here to tell the truth.We arrived at B Spot and was seated right away.  The atmosphere was like going to Chipotle surrounded by beer cans. Loud Loud Loud and the tables felt like family style, too close!  We ordered the Chocolate Banana Marshmallow milkshake 6.00. The toasted marshmallows were yuck. I know they are supposed to taste like your roasting marshmallows over a campfire...but yuck! We placed our order. I ordered the Blue Cow Burger: with roasted red peppers, basil, red onion, blue cheese 9.00 with an order of onion rings 6.00 and Jason ordered the Shroomage Burger: with portabella, blue cheese, Lola steak sauce, griddled onions 9.00 with chili cheese fries 7.00. Our order arrived quite quickly...15 minutes. The first thing we tried were the chili cheese fries.... Yikes.... I have never ate Hormel chili in a can, but I am sure it would have tasted like what we were being served. Skip them! The cheese and scallions were sparse, needless to say we did not eat anymore of them.  The Blue Cow Burger was good, but man, could you put some cheese on it? Jason had the same complaint about his burger...sparse cheese. The onion rings were OK. Ive had better. To sum it all up! The burgers were good and flavorful, but lacked toppings and a bit over priced for there size. Will I go back? I may give them a whirl in the future.... It depends on who wants to check it out with me again. Jason says NO! :-) Sorry Symon! I am really enjoying your new cook book! I wish I could be as excited about B Spot! It felt B-Flat!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm just not hip enough to get the vibe.  Very loud and crowded.  Burgers were average at best.  Sorry, but I see nothing redeeming about this place.  Will not be back.  I think that the hype is what makes this place a \"hot spot\"."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 3 stars because of the beer selection, ambiance, and uniqueness.  But vegetarians need to be aware all fried foods including the French fries are cooked in LARD.  The menu is very limited for not just vegetarians, but for those who do not eat pork.  Many times the stand by staple at restaurants is the french fries if you want to be social with others but they messed these up by frying them in lard."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful in recommending burgers and milkshakes.   I tried a little bit of the Apple and Bacon milkshake. I was ok. However, I ordered the chocolate banana marshmallow milkshake. It was amazing! I would highly recommend it. The size of the milkshake is large enough for two servings. We were offered to-go cups for the extras. I like that they have a pickle bar. As a pickle lover this was a great feature and unique to any restaurant I had been before. The French fries were also good. They weren't greasy and were very flavorful.   This is a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour for burgers that were mediocre.  and small.  They should come with fries but we ordered them separately.  Which were cold so I assume they too were waiting on the burger.   And parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"I am a huge Michael Symon fan so I love supporting his restaurants! B Spot always produces a great burger and fries. I strongly advise you to get the espresso milkshake you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A nice burger place with fine decor, a small sports bar and friendly staff. Lola burger was delicious with fine beef patty and nice buns. Also a pickle bar for all kinds of pickled veggie toppings. But the fries are really the stars here. Generously seasoned with rosemary and fried to golden perfection, they were not too crispy and not too mushy. Very satisfactory burger dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential.  We literally came to the B Spot purely for the Impossible burger.   This is a new plant based burger that bleeds like red meat.  The restaurant is in a retail complex, in a strip with other shops.  It is easy to get to.    The restaurant itself is comfortable, has an open bar and kitchen in the back.  The menu has a lot of options and there is a pickle bar with many different types of pickles and peppers.  Beware, all fried items are friend in LARD!  Even the grilled onions are grilled in BACON FAT.  This limited us in several ways IE: no fries with that burger.  So I doubled up on the Impossible burger (2 patties) and it was definitely enough food.   Anyways, to make a long story short, there were 4 of us, they messed up on 3 of the dishes.  There  is a workers, whose sole job is to make sure the food coming from the cooks is what is on the ticket, so the servers/waiters don't have to be embarrassed when they bring the wrong food to the table.  He failed.  He was \"high as a kite\".  Whatever...  Also, I do have to say, I did get sick that night for like 24 hours.  The burger itself was delicious, I was very satisfied as it was going down, but things changed and I don't know if it was the burger, or due to the restaurant and/or any type of contamination.  No one else got sick, and 2 others had the Impossible burger.  3 stars for now.   The place has a lot of potential to be great."}
{"text":"4 1/2. After seeing this place on Food Network, I bookmarked it and when I came to Cleveland this week (Mom) I decided to drop by. Like many of my bookmarks, I couldn't remember why or how I chose to mark this place but was reminded when the bartender told me Michael Symon is the owner. I was a little concerned and confused by the three-star rating on yelp, and after eating (and drinking) here, I'm still confused. The meat is good/fresh and has real flavor, the burger is proportioned perfectly, tremendous creative options on the menu, and as a previous poster said - the pickle bar is genius. Service was excellent and pleasant, and my brother came out before I got done reading the rest of the menu. Last but not least; they have an awesome beer selection on tap, including Belgians for those that like them. Not my favorite burger on the planet, but it ranks up there and I'll come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant.  Every time we have visitors in town we bring them up to B-Spot and they are always pleased.  I am a vegetarian so I always get the \"Why??\" sandwich, which is a portabella mushroom sandwich that is DELICIOUS.  Their fries are amazing (rosemary...hmmm)  and the chocolate-banana-toasted marshmallow shake is phenomenal (even though it takes three of us to finish it)."}
{"text":"I was at the nail salon and as usual the food Network was on.  Micheal symon was one of the judges and it made me want to go to the b spot and get some rosemary fries . I recently switched to a meat dairy free diet so I want expecting them to have anything meatless but they did ! I ordered the impossible burger on gluten free bread and it's the best thing I've eaten since changing my diet !! It was so good I actually cried . Lol  also the girls up front and were very friendly, kind and efficient. I will be back more often now that I know about this impossible burger"}
{"text":"Why did I give this place one star...  a. I ordered a medium rare cause I'm low on iron (yay pregnancy) it came out medium..barely any pink. The man ordered medium and it was medium well so it wasn't a mistake.  b. chili was so dry and lackluster c. $30 bucks for to subpar burgers, fries and a shake  You should try the bacon milkshake, which does taste like apple jacks the spicy pickles from the pickle bar."}
{"text":"Service was good and friendly but the food was not good at all. I expected the burger to be fabulous since the place is known for burgers. It was dry and tasteless.  Expensive and not worth it. Restaurant must be staying alive living off the Michael Simon name. Would not return. Go to Whiteys for burgers. ..best burgers around!"}
{"text":"I first gave this place 5 stars when it just opened. Then it started sucking pretty bad, but it looks like things are a little better now. Now it's only a mediocre generic burger place..."}
{"text":"happy hour win sliders are two bucks apiece burger trifecta  So the Yelps are pretty polarized on the B-Spot.  I myself, am a fan.   Terrific burgers and sides. LOVE the onion rings.  LOVE them. Fries are as good as you can get.  They cook them in lard (YES!!!) as well. Done right folks, done right.  The burgers are just the right size IMHO. Not ridiculously big, it's quality, not quantity. A great Happy Hour bar menu too, featuring sliders cooked to temperature, which is pretty uncommon.   The temps seem to run a bit on the rarer side, so be aware of that.  \"Rare\" is one step away from a steak tartare. \"Well Done\" will still have a hint of pink.  No issue with the \"Rules\" here.  It's not Burger King. But it is also not a fine dining experience, where you order in courses.   So now I'm craving a B-Spot cheeseburger. I'd even go to a casino to eat one.  That says a lot.  Carry on..."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, sat at the bar. Asked for a drink menu and was never given a chance to really look at it. The bartender hovered and had an attitude like the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz. Your customer relations, learn how to fake it. Girl with brown hair and lots of bronzer. Didn't get her name. Thank you."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland, I had it on my list to visit a Michael Symon restaurant. I'm so glad I did. I had the Fat Doug cooked medium, and it was absolutely amazing! The rosemary fries were good...different for me but good. The chocolate espresso milkshake was pretty dang tasty as well!  The waiter was a little short, but he did take care of us.   Altogether, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, kinda a long wait for the food. The fries are sold separately, but are enough for 2 people to share (not huge, but just right). The shakes are deadly good...come with a huge straw because they are so thick."}
{"text":"B Spot has a lot of positives and only a handful of not-so-positives. As I was in town visiting over a hellishly hot 4th of July weekend, it only seemed natural that my family and I hit up B Spot for a tasty burger.   Upon entering, Michael Symon's \"B Spot Rules\" are posted just about everywhere, including each table. Most of these rules are kitschy and fun (no whining, no substitutions, etc) but it's worth noting that every seat is first come, first served, and your entire party must be present to sit. So, no reservations, folks. That being said, my family and I were seated, fed and paid out in less than an hour; the folks in the kitchen work FAST.   The menu is straightforward with a handful of apps, salads and plenty of burgers, bratwurst, bologna and other. Our server was \"meh\" all the way around - while he fetched our food in a correct and timely manner, he seemed aloof and really not too interested in being there. No matter, though, I was too busy chowing down my chocolate shake and cheeseburger. Bonus points for the pickle bar!   The food is solid, nicely prepared and in moderately sized portions. Don't expect a mammoth burger, but these patties are flavorful and fairly sized. Sides are extra, so if you're in the sharing mode, try the onion rings - they are spectacular. Those rings are perfectly crispy, slightly sweet and were a great accompaniment to my juicy burger. And yes, you can by all means share a shake...one shake is large enough for two. Unless you're on a mission to blow an artery, then go for it full blast."}
{"text":"We've tried this place twice and have been disappointed both times.  Patties are premade and too compacted to yield a good, juicy and tatsty burger.  Fries are extra.  Place is way over rated.  But sometimes Michael Simon's shows are interesting.  Bj"}
{"text":"It was alright. I had the Yo! burger.... was expecting a lot more. The bun is SUPER though. The meat (ordered medium) was surprisingly dry... Onion rings were  good, and so was the iced tea. Nothing here was absolutely outstanding, though, considering the price.  Service was fast and efficient considering the crowd, and size of the establishment. Parking can be very frustrating at lunch..."}
{"text":"Great Pub. Many great menu choices everything we had perfectly and delicious. Wonderful staff with a full bar and a free Pickle bar."}
{"text":"When I landed in Cleveland...all I heard about was B spot.  I was excited to try it.  I tried it...wasn't too excited about it.  The food was ok.  The wait for the food was not ok.  The service was great though.  I'll pass next time!"}
{"text":"As a longtime burger conoisseur, i've been to the much heralded B-Spot a few times in the past, but this time was the last!  The place has progressively gotten worse over the years.  Case in point.  I took my wife and daughter there tonight, after my little girl had a visit and photo op with the Crocker Park Santa.  We were all in a great mood, until I bit into bony gristle in my cheeseburger, not once, but twice!  Disgusting!  Spitting a mouthful of bread and meat out into my paper towel napkin must have been quite the unpleasant sight for my family and nearby patrons!  The burger also seemed dry and much less flavorful than during my previous visits.  In addition, they got rid of the chili cheese fries (I knew this from previous visits, but never mentioned it online), and the coffee was too strong.  We ordered the regular fries, and the server brought them to our table in a large metal container, with fries falling out all over the table.  The fries themselves were of the super thin variety, which reminded me of McDonald's or other fast food fries!  They were unimpressive in the taste department.  Also, the men's room has no paper towels, which I needed to open the door handle while exiting, so I don't get any bacteria or viruses on my hands before handling my burger!  I don't mind the hand air drying part, but having no paper towels is ridiculous.  What added insult to injury was the ridiculously high bill of around fifty dollars (excluding tip) for a party of 2 adults and a child, for a gourmet burger experience that was dissapointing.  Sorry B-Spot, but you have been dethroned by the much better, tastier 'The Rail' in North Olmsted.  I've been there a few times lately, and B-Spot doesn't compare!"}
{"text":"I freakin love coming here and today was no exception!!! Patio seating, great food with my burger cooked just right, friendly and quick service!!! Not to mention the rum filled milkshakes that will always bring the boys to the yard!!! Always a fun treat for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Great place food Was great . I thought  flip side was good they are a McDonald's restaurant to this great place well worth it ."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is outstanding but it's a bit on the pricey side and you have to purchase fries separately.  That being said...OH MY! The porky fries are to die for! Of course they make you feel exactly that, porky. Pulled pork, cheese, pickled chilies on fries? No questions there. The answer is yes, you do want to eat them.  These guys pickle everything and it is genius. For those who love spicy food like me, the Atomic burger takes the cake for eye watering deliciousness. Ghost chilies, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese and habanero sauce means lots of water to accompany that one. The French onion, Lola, so many great burgers to choose from.  What would be better than porky fries and a juicy burger? How about a milkshake to go with it. No I'm not talking about your run of the mill vanilla shake here. I'm talking about a vanilla bean milkshake with not only apple pie and bacon in it, you can also add a shot of bourbon. I know what you're thinking....WHAAAT? Oh yea...a vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake with bourbon. Order it stat, pronto, tonight!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of burger spots like this in Chicago: M Burger, Epic Burger, DMK Burger Bar, the list goes on. So my bar is set pretty high for 'boutique burgers.' B Spot's flavors, ingredients and ambiance definitely stand up to my go-to spots in the Windy City.  Came here for lunch with a co-worker and there was absolutely no wait. I ordered the Chick Magnet and, let me tell ya, it really hit my B Spot. The avocado, chicken, arugula and tomato really went well together. My bun fell apart about halfway through, which made it really messy to eat. The Lola fries, as usual, were amazing-delicious.  My only complaint is you can't sub things out. I'm not a huge mayo fan, so I would have loved to replace that with something else. Once they change this silly no subbing rule, my review will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had the New Jack City. Great burger with really good flavor but a little messy with the avocado. Lola fries are delicious as well. Good beer selection, even though I couldn't get one. A little loud but casual fun atmosphere. Can't wait to try some more of there menu."}
{"text":"Breakfast stout with a brat and simple salad.  Does not get much better than that. The fries are thin, crisp and salty with a touch of rosemary. One of our burgers was not medium well but was raw and charred. Service is good.  Always crowded."}
{"text":"Great burger, and a pickle bar too?!?!?!  For people expecting a big Michael Symon ordeal, remember this is a burger joint.  Great burger, cooked perfectly to the correct temp.  Only complaint I have is that they have NO waiting area, so while we were eating we had the people waiting for a table hovering over us because our table was right near the door."}
{"text":"Why does B Spot have such a low rating?  People are fucking stupid, and there are too many of them. Why I'm pro-abortion, easier to kill them while they're little.  Great food, good beer selection, gets very busy so be prepared for that.  A lot of shitty albums, shitty movie tickets, bud light, and American cars have been sold to the mouthbreathers who don't like the place, so poll that audience as much as you'd like.  Honestly, only valid criticism I can level after coming here 10x is the prices are a lil high, like me."}
{"text":"Michael Symon, thank you for creating this restaurant! I had the best burger of my life here, period. I got the \"SHROOMAGE\" - a burger with a giant portobella mushroom and some fried onions on it. There was also some kind of a balsamic steak sauce involved... Needless to say, this burger was worth WAYYY more than the 8 bucks or so it cost me. I also had chips with Parmesan cheese sauce/dip, these were simply incredible.  Their beer selection was great, the food came out really fast and service was good. They don't take reservations so we did have to wait about 45 min to be sat but I knew this was likely in advance. Be prepared to wait if you're coming here during peak hours."}
{"text":"Really great burgers. Michael Symon's place. Sit outside during the nice fall weather if you can but there's only one table."}
{"text":"I am surprised at some of the low reviews - I think B Spot was delicious and nice that they have meaty and veggie burger options.  I have been there 3-4 times and have consistent positive experience.  Unique mix ups for burger toppings or make your own.   MMMMM those milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Craving a burger?! Hit up the B Spot. I laugh every time I say that out loud, for obvious sexual reasons!? 0) Recommended to us by a friend we stopped in for an early dinner. Our waitress Deborah was great, helping us through the menu and giving us suggestions on what she liked and what was popular.  Our her recommendation I had to try the Vanilla Apple Bacon Shake. Very unusual and if you are a bacon lover you will most definitely like this one. Tasted like an apple cobbler with a bunch of crumbled bacon on top blended with some vanilla ice cream into a shake!  We both went with burgers, the Yo and The Smashers Special. Both were cooked to a perfect medium and we loved them. We also got an order of O(onion) rings, the sides are a la carte and do not come with the burgers. The burgers are not overly large but definitely big enough to satisfy an adult.  One side is enough for 2 people to share. Would love to come back to another B Spot location and try something else. And I love Michael Symon so why wouldn't I? No military discount"}
{"text":"Had the Porky's and a Dortmunder to drink. This is, without question, THE BEST burger I have ever had. Add a hit of the tableside coffee bbq sauce for an even more amazing burger. Service is on point. Atmosphere is great. First time here, will DEFINITELY return."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Michael Simon . this place was at a tasty treat . Burgers were delicious Lola fries ,onion rings were the bomb . but the pickles were to die for 6 different type all delicious . good selection of beer too -that is all"}
{"text":"Had to write my review on this, because I just heard they were coming to Columbus! I went here after I went wedding dress shopping with my best friend for her wedding. All around, it was great! The food was delicious and I couldn't have asked for more at a place like this. They have a wide variety of burgers to choose from and their fries were amazing! They also have milkshakes, which you can add alcohol in them; obviously this makes the milkshakes more fun! B Spot also has a toppings bar which allows you to add additional items onto your burger if it doesn't come with it.  Although it is a bit on the pricey side for burgers, it is a very good burger. If I lived in Cleveland, I'd be visiting more than just once! Really hope the rumor about B Spot coming to Columbus is true!"}
{"text":"Holy Hamburgers, Batman!  B Spot is delightful.  I am so happy that one of my co-workers suggested that we come in on a recent trip to Cleveland.  When I heard that it was a burger joint, I didn't have very high expectations.  It was only after I arrived that I realized this is a Michael Symon restaurant.  The menu is extensive and has a lot of burger options.  I opted for the Gobbler and was really impressed with the juicy level of the turkey burger.  I loved that there is a pepper bar and I loaded up on hot peppers for my burger.  I also really enjoyed the different sauces that are on the table to put on your burger/fries.  We tried out regular fries, onion rings, and fries topped with cheese, jalapenos, and pork and they were all really good.  Beer selection is top notch, as well.  There is a burger here for everyone.  I really recommend stopping into B Spot if you are in the area as it is a truly delicious place to have a meal!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Nice menu!  Great burgers (and other stuff) and don't forget the pickle bar!  Outstanding craft beer selection!"}
{"text":"Great reviews and all spot on for sure.  I stopped in while in Woodmere over the weekend for a late lunch / early dinner with the wife and figured B-Spot would fit the bill perfectly.   Note: How can you, vegetarians excluded, not want to come to B-Spot after walking by and smelling the grill exhaust, wholly molly, you had me at grilled beef.  Anyway....  I went with the Lola Burger and wife went with the Shroom.  Instead of actually eating the shroom, she gave it to me and I topped mine with the nicely grilled Portabello cap.  I ordered mine medium, hers well (pregnant), each coming to the table perfectly cooked, as ordered, and stacked high.  We also went with the Lola Fries and Chips with parmesan dipping sauce, which went perfect with both starches.  I also hit the pickle bar for a few added treats, each pickled delight was great with the burger and even as a snack on the side.  Overall great food, priced for quality and name brand, but wonderful for someone on a limited schedule.  I waited 7 minutes but was there at 5pm, get early or plan on waiting.  This is true for a few of the restaurants around that area, except for maybe Corky and Lenny's.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"MMMM......B Spot. I mostly love you.  Fat Doug - you are my favorite lover. O man, I can't get enough of your cole slaw/stadium mustard/swiss cheese/pastrami/burger heaven! I've tried some of the others on the menu, but I keep coming back to you.  Fries are a la carte but are thin, crispy, and rosemary-seasoned - SO good.   Smasher's special - different burger every week or so on special. Sean's gotten them a few times and liked it.   Fat Doug (see above)  Apple pie/bacon/vanilla bean shake - awesomeness. I mean who doesn't love bacon anyway (except Jewish and Muslim peeps...and vegetarians....) Yeah well.....I love bacon and it's a great addition to a sweet shake.  We love the food here and come back a couple of times a month. The only reason B Spot gets 4 stars is that the atmosphere pretty much sucks in my opinion. Although Eton is nice as strip malls go, it's still a mall. There is absolutely nowhere to wait for a table so you have to go walk around the mall. That in itself doesn't really bother me because I am a book slut and we just go into Barnes and Noble next door.   What I have against the place is that there is sort of an 'indoor patio' type seating area outside of the main area which juts out into the mall. B Spot is trying to be a casual burger joint, which it is. But then the restaurant is open on one side to an upscale mall. It just doesn't work. Different location, close it up and make it more dive-y feeling and It'd be much cooler.  At the end of the day, awesome food. Definitely add it to your list."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and fries!  I had a classic bacon cheddar beef burger with carmalized onion sooooo freaking good!"}
{"text":"for some reason, i never made it a point to go to b spot until yesterday. i don't know if it was because i always assumed they used brioche bins judging by the photos (im allergic to eggs) or that i assumed it was overrated but whatever the case may be, i'm truly sad that i hadn't tried the magic that is b spot until yesterday.   my fiancé and i came for lunch around 1 o'clock and sat outside on the patio at a table with an umbrella, which was much appreciated as it was very sunny. i ordered the Symon sipper cocktail and he ordered a drink who's name i cannot recall but had rosemary in it. i would probably pass on the cocktails next time as they were nothing to write home about and overly sweet (just like Mabel's cocktails).   for our entrees, he had the new school bologna sandwich, i had the mr porky without cheese and we got fries and pork cracklings on the side. the waitress was very helpful with finding as much out about the ingredients of the buns in regards to my dairy and egg allergy, which was much appreciated. omg both of our entrees were outstanding. i added the coffee bbq sauce on the table to my brat and it was absolutely fantastic. my fiancé devoured his sandwich and we loved the fries and cracklings as well. the waitresses aren't exactly the most friendly (ours never checked to see if we enjoyed our food) but it's a blip on the radar compared to how delicious everything was.   we cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I won't be going back to the B-Spot anytime soon...   I have been to Micheal Simon's other restaurant \"Lolita\" and really enjoyed it.  Walking into B-Spot with that in mind was a problem.  To give you the background of our experience, we arrived about 1pm on a Sunday.  I got the chicken sandwich and my fiance got the grilled cheese.  We split them both. I got the vanilla apple pie bacon milkshake and he got a bourbon drink.  We also go the house made chips with rosemary dip to split.    Our first impression was sloppy looking staff, and no waiting area. You have to hover on top of everyone who is trying to come in.   There is a very young host staff, but the servers seemed to know what they were doing. The entire place was packed and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for two.  There were a few 4 people tables available, with a sign at every table that clearly states that no reservations were allowed. My only conclusion is that the staff is not allowed to sit 2 people at a table for 4.  That's great for the restaurants pocket book, but bad for customer service.   The food was sub-par and overpriced.  Nothing tastes or looks, made from scratch.  It all tastes very premade. At $9 for a grilled cheese, I expected a lot more. I didn't care for either sandwich.  The chicken was dry and the peppers on the grilled cheese were very bitter. The chips were ok, but the sauce was thick and congealed looking.   The only thing I really liked was the milkshake.  Those flavors really do go good together!  Perhaps if we had gotten a burger we would have liked it more, however, then everything else on the menu should be cheaper.  Because nothing else is very good.   Overall I think that this is a great example of a good idea gone mainstream.  Everything was \"how do we lower the cost as much as possible but still make money from the clients.\"  There was obviously no other motivation in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Burgers good, but very small.  HAVE to order side dishes, not even served with chips.  French fries cost too much for the portion you get, and they were overcooked.  Drinks over priced as well.  Service was fine, but entire atmosphere ruined by the awful music.  Not only was the first song by new kids on the block, it was way too loud.  Asked if it could be turned down, or better turned off, but nothing doing.  There are plenty of places to get burgers.   Not going back."}
{"text":"I would go here during the off periods. You get faster service and better food in my opinion. Burgers I had here were delicious and I LOVE the Lola Fries. The beer selection is great for a restaurant like this. I've never been to the other locations so I can't tell you how this rate to the others but overall, this place gets it done. Compared to all the other food places in Crocker Park area, this place wins it 9 out of 10 times. Who in their right mind would choose Brio's over this if you were getting food on the whim. Better question, why is Brio still in business?"}
{"text":"Positives:  + Burgers, brats, and shakes are AMAZING! These are LOADED sandwiches containing peppers, avocados, onions, sauerkraut, etc., that really compliment the burgers and brats well, though you can always order more \"plane-Jane\"/\"vanilla\" options and add your own stuff from the pickle bar.  + Can add alcohol option to shakes.  + Delicious sauce options available in bottles on tables.  + Pickles from pickle bar are very sweet.  + Thick-cut bologna, though I've never tried it.  + Cool aesthetics (e.g., beer cans in the shape of a \"B\" on wall, red-antler-chandelier-like fixture hanging from ceiling, etc.).  + Informal setting/atmosphere.  + Convenient location next to Starbucks on Strongsville Greens off Route 82/Royalton Road, about a mile from I-71.  Negatives:  - Sides (e.g., French fries) not included.  - No \"al fresco\" option.  - Pickle bar exists but is underwhelming to eyes.  Recommendations:  * Try apple-bacon shake with bourbon; may sound disgusting, but salty and sweet combinations really pair well.  * Try the Lola ketchup, which includes chili sauce.  Overall:  I'd give it a four-and-a-half. Not cheap, but not ridiculously expensive, either. Food taste and quality are worth every penny! Make no mistake: B Spot is OUR spot; make it yours, too!"}
{"text":"Got to hit the B Spot today. Had the chili burger. It really was exceptional. One of the best burgers. Plus a great pickle bar. The only place it could be improved is the bun. I've had better burger buns. But overall it was outstanding. Some demerits because it was in one of those cheesy Mall/Villages. If I go again and enjoy it as much i'll raise to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Restaurant atmosphere and service were good, but the food was nothing great. The burger was very average, and the fries were standard. The homemade ketchup wasn't bad, but tasted heavy in cumin. They did have six sauces at each table to try, as well as a pickle bar which was really great. When ordering, the burger is a set price, and anything you want to add (from arugula to sauces to French fries) is an additional charge, but the plain burger comes with lettuce tomato and onion included-only if you ask for it. The side of fries is larger enough for two people to share, FYI. Not a fan of the pricing structure, it was $16 for a burger with avocado and a side of fries. Much rather go to a 5 Guys for price and taste, this was no better than your average diner burger."}
{"text":"We checked b spot out on Sunday, yes they are open on Sunday, contrary to yelps info... And we were delighted. Not impressed but delighted. I had the pulled pork sandwhich, Carmelized onions (which i was hesitant about but loved them once I took a bite) and no cheddar cheese. I ordered a side salad, which was swimming in dressing :( also by the time I was done eating it, I had to knife and fork my sandwich because the bread got soggy. He had the Simon says and was very in love. Had a side of fries and enjoyed their dipping sauces at the table. Service was super quick but I didn't like being a first timer with lack of info. No insight on the sauces nothing about the pickle bar which id had loved to try. Overall we liked it and will be back, but he did say the burger was smaller than anticipated but made up for it in flavor. Definitely a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Updated:  My review was 2 stars it is now 4 - the policies listed below have been changed and they now have a veggie burger.  My only criticism is that they should have some other oil than lard for those of us who love the fries but are vegetarian.  Otherwise - great job Michael for listening to the comments of your customers.    Good food - terrible service.  The two door guys wouldn't seat us until the last person arrived.  When we joked that we could be spending money rather than standing and waiting we were told that our table was ready and waiting but the \"policy\" is that they have to wait to seat parties until everyone arrives.  Nice \"policy\"  Then, one of the people in our party has food allergies and the server refused to substitute anything.  \"I can take things off but we won't add or substitute anything\".  When asked how they deal with people with food allergies the server just shrugged her shoulders and rolled her eyes and mentioned that it was their \"policy\".  Finally - I needed to add a to go order and she wouldn't take the order until later.  \"if you order it now it will come out now\" when I asked if I could order now and have it before we leave she said \"no\""}
{"text":"I don't get it - maybe it's the Michael Symon novelty but the burgers just aren't that good. On my last visit it took over 40 minutes to get my food and the burgers were dry, not that warm and the service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I would come back just to eat the condiments by the spoonful. Seriously.   I don't know where to start. The burger. I got the Bambino. Its got prosciutto with mozzarella on a luscious patty. Prosciutto on a burger? Really? Yes...and it's f***ing delicious. Normally, I load my burger with condiments, but I wanted to taste the burger as it was meant to be tasted - as it was presented by the kitchen. It was a good decision. Writing this review is making me want another one.   The lola fries (I believe that's what they were called) were excellent. We got 2 orders between 3 dudes, but should've gotten 2 per dude. Generally, when it comes to fries, I don't really care for them a whole lot. I loved these.  Now. Let's get to the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon Shake. I was told to order one. I sat and deliberated between the other shakes because; A) I don't like vanilla; B) I don't like Apple Pie; C) I didn't think bacon could pull up this trio on its own. Oh. My. God. It was amazing. The combination was awesome. The \"bacon grits\" that remain in your mouth after everything dissolved, are unreal. They're tiny, but large enough to bite into. They're so crispy and delicious. I don't know how they pulled this off, but they did.   The condiments. I couldn't stop sopping them up with fries. The lola ketchup, the coffee bbq, that wickedly delicious and spicy green sauce was unbelievable. I wanted to rip the lids off and drink them.   I don't live in Cleveland, but if I ever moved there, B Spot would be playing a huge role in my decision."}
{"text":"Second visit to this location. Have been to the one in Strongsville three times since it opened.   I need to address the whining about the \"no variations\" thing. Folks, here's the deal, when you achieve the sort of success a Micheal Symon has you have damn well earned the right to run YOUR restaurant any way you want.   If you can't find a burger on the menu that doesn't work for you, you're not interested in a great burger as much as stuffing your ego between a bun. Seriously, you want choices why not just go to, oh, I don't know, Red Robin or Friday's or some other joint that wouldn't know a great burger from a kumquat. Seriously.   Oh, and if you should PERHAPS still be po'd because Mikey didn't come wish you a happy anniversary last November, then you really DO have issues that go beyond food. Here's a suggestion then: How 'bout you leave the real restaurants to the adults?   This is incredibly creative, fresh, remarkable food served in a unique way and it will make Symon MORE millions, and I say, GOOD FOR HIM."}
{"text":"Look, we all know food is almost as subjective as music. Stones or The Beatles? Led Zeppelin or The Who? Skrillrex or Knife Party? Yeah, the old dude loves Dubstep; so sue me.   But while some may prefer The Stones, The Who and Knife Party, no one can deny the artistry and genuis of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Skrillex.  Well, you could if you are a moron, but there aren't many of those here at Yelp.  And, no, I'm not going to name them.  Today.   But, gotta tell you, when I read reviews of the 1 and 2 star type for any of Michael Symon's places, I really and truly have to wonder.  Can Lola have an off night? Sure! Can Lolita drop the ball once in a while? Of course! Can B Spot be less than perfect on occasion? You betcha, garlic breath! Stuff Happens.   What's my point? It's this: If YOU have a terrible (or even less than good) experience at one of Symon's places and haven't received satisfaction from the manager or that manager's manager, then I say you just might be one of those M-words, or perhaps English is your third language. I have eaten at all three of his places more calories than I care to count and have never, ever, EVER received anything less than 100% full and complete cooperation making something (even slightly) wrong right.    If you really had a bad experience DO SOMETHING.  And, please don't give me, \"oh I didn't want to bother,\" or \"Oh, that's just not me,\" or \"I was too upset and I'm NEVER going back! Know why? Because the first one means it wasn't that big of a deal to you so stop complaining.  The second means it wasn't that big a deal to you or you have zero backbone, so stop complaining.  And,  the third one means to the rest of us you won't be missed!    Tonight during dinner I turned to my wife and said, \"If I never have another burger better than this one, I won't care.\"  So you can take your Five Guys and Brown Bag and Red Robin and blah blah blah blah and if you enjoy them, great!  But, please, please, PLEASE do not insult us with reviews about how Symon's \"overrated.\" Just look in the mirror and understand that is where the issue is.   And, just for the record, I prefer Skrillex.."}
{"text":"So I met a friend for lunch in Crocker Park and we decided to give B Spot a try. I heard the burgers were good, but we ended up with a pulled pork and a grilled cheese. Both were delicious! The atmosphere is pretty cool. I really like how one whole wall is a garage door that's open on nice days leading out to the patio. It was great to be able to sit inside on a nice day with the feel and fresh air of outside.   If you're looking for a good American style restaurant, I would definitely give B Spot a try! I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"When I was a grad student at JCU, my fellow classmates and I would frequently go to this restaurant if we have some time in-between classes and work. I have to applaud them for the variety that they have in their burgers. The pickle bar is such a nice touch where you can pick how many pickles and peppers you want on your burger and it's free! The rosemary fries are DIVINE and still to this day, I long for them!   The only thing that prevented me from giving them 5 stars is the size of their burgers. They are so good but they are a bit small (at least to me) to warrant a $6-$10 price tag on them. A little pricey in my eyes and I would expect a bit of weight into the burger for that or maybe a generous helping of the side dishes but no.  But besides that, the service is wonderful, prompt and welcoming. Also, go during happy hour where the food is discounted a bit and so is the beer (but happy hour used to be so much better, not so much anymore). If you are a burger and beer lover, this place may be your nirvana."}
{"text":"The burger was solid.  Very tasty.  The fries were good, but I prefer thick cut.  The vanilla bean, apple, bacon shake was amazing!  The pickle bar was a nice touch.  If I'm ever in Beachwood again, I'll be visiting."}
{"text":"As a non-meat eater, I was a little disappointed. Most places have a veg burger, hell, some places have a homemade from scratch veg burger. Went to B Spot on Thursday for lunch with a couple co-workers. There is ONE veg burger option, Why burger (portobello mushroom). It was fine. The fries are cooked in lard. My co-workers enjoyed their burgers. One of them actually goes to B Spot about one to two time a month. The service was wonderful. The server was very friendly, talkative and refilled my pop often. I enjoyed the pickle bar."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I actually don't care about Michael Symon.  His name alone does not make me like his restaurants.  Next, I am not a big fan of restaurant burgers.  Why?  Well, most joints make them too big, out of crap meat, cooked incorrectly, on crap bread.  When I do go to a good enough restaurant that probably makes them well, I get a dish that is a little more posh and inventive.  Therefore, I rarely eat burgers out.  All this has changed now that I have found B-Spot.  Burgers are the perfect size.  Not too big, not too small.  Always cooked to specifications (I waver between medium and medium-rare, hubs is a medium-well kinda guy).  The burger combos are inventive, but not crazy-stupid-wacky-nonsensical.  I enjoy trying new things each time I am there.  I LOVE Lola fries.  Admittedly, they have been way too salty the last 2 times I have been there (and I love salty fries).  Their onion rings are great, but aren't they always?  Oh and you know what?  I haven't felt ill after eating here.  It usually happens when I have a greasy burger and fries from a restaurant.  Alcohol - ok, I should have known to add liquor to my milkshakes.  I didn't and I love that I can get that here.  I wish they would go a little heavier on the liquor, though.  Yummy, nonetheless.  They have a well selected bar menu and I am particularly happy with the whiskey selections (and descriptions).  Service is great.  It is quick, efficient, and not snotty.  I expected it to be a little highfalutin, like the some of Eton mall (and patrons), but it isn't.  Price - Yes, it is a little pricer that typical bar fare, but it is worth it.  Atmosphere - it is in a mall.  It isn't fancy. It isn't a dive.  It is a good, busy burger joint.  If you have those expectations, you are good.  Cons: BUSY!  I get around this by going earlier than 6.  If not, I get my name on the list and fit in a little Trader Joe's shopping."}
{"text":"This is a review of the glorious happy hour! Seriously, it rocks. From 3-6 Mon-Friday B spot offers all burgers for $5, brats and bologna for $2 and Lola fries for just a buck! (Unlike other happy hours that sell food cheaper because the portions are significantly smaller, at Bspot the portions are the same!) If that isn't enough to get you heading in bspots direction, all draft beers are only $3 (including the good stuff like fatheads and Christmas ale)"}
{"text":"Great place for good food, excellent music, and great beer. We had the Fat Doug (burger, cheese, cole slaw and pastrami), the Shroomage (mushrooms and cheese), onion rings, and the house made chips and fondue.  The Pat LaFrieda's burger mix was juicy and flavorful, the burgers cooked to perfection (one medium rare, the other medium well). The onion rings were large and went great with the six sauces provided (the Balsamic Steak Sauce might have been our favorite).  Piped in music was mostly 70s and right in our wheelhouse. Beer selection was excellent, about 20 drafts all laid out by type of beer. Service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Positives - Quick food service, good burger  Negatives - You name it.  Quick service and a good tasting burger is great, but if you can't get the burger how you want it - what's the point?  We came with one 3-year old and asked to order his food first so he was happily fed - answer was no.  We asked for a kid's menu - there was none.  We asked for a drink other than cranberry juice or soda for him - they had no other options.  We asked to order appetizers - again not without ordering our main course and then everything comes out at once.  So if you are a foodie or want to enjoy a hot appetizer and a hot entree - you are out of luck.    I am pregnant and had been craving a burger for a week.  My favorite burger is a burger with mushrooms & cheese - so a burger with mushrooms, sliced onions and cheese would be perfect, except I can't have soft cheeses (the blue cheese) that came on the burger.  I asked for a substitution and was firmly told no.  I was not trying to be picky but soft cheeses are strictly forbidden.  So I ask for a regular cheeseburger instead - the response - what kind of cheese would you like on it?    I would never go back to such an inflexible establishment.  It's ridiculous.  Imagine how great it could be if they just loosened some silly policies?  The menu is simple so substituting a few ingredients shouldn't make that much time in terms of service and I think people would be willing to wait to get a burger they actually want."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this restaurant.  I am not a big burger eater.  If my husband is in the mood for a burger, we usually go to Red Robin or Houlihan's.  If you like a burger from either of these places, you will be absolutely amazed at the burgers at B spot.  I got the Thin Lizzy and it was absolutely delicious!  I am never usually able to eat an entire burger on my own, but after I was done I actually wanted more!    Some people have complained about the price, and maybe I'm nuts, but I expected this place to be a lot more expensive than it was!  It's very reasonable for a good burger.  Sure you have to pay for fries separately, but if you go during happy hour, fries are only a dollar.  My husband and I got out of there at $20.00 for both of us (before tip), so even if I had to pay full price for the fries, this is still super affordable!  However, I must say that I wasn't that impressed with the fries and I can probably do without next time.  Overall, I found the service to be good, the place was a little too small, it was rather loud (what do you expect from such a small place), and the food to be amazingly delicious and affordable.  What more can you ask for?  If you haven't been here yet, all I can say is what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Real burgers, fries, vanilla bean milkshakes with Kahlua and vodka And a pickle bar. Life is good. Service fast and efficient"}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about this place and I was really looking forward to it- but I was disappointed.  Maybe it had been built up too much, but my friend and I were unimpressed with our lunches.   I had the pulled pork, he had a burger and a milkshake.  The pork was really underseasoned and the burger was overcooked (requested med. rare, arrived well done). The pickle bar was awesome and the shake was delicious, fries were fine- not amazing, but good. But the service was really slow- but she was very polite. We'd mentioned we were in a hurry before we were seated and we were assured that our food would take less than 15 min.  It actually took about 40, which would have been fine, if we hadn't been told 15.  Our server was nice, though.   I was willing to try it again, last time I was in town but my friend- who lives nearby said she'd heard it'd gone downhill and suggested going elsewhere.  I may give it another shot, but it's not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Awesome burger, craft beer and pickles. ....gotta love pickles. Chose their spicy burger with habanero aioli I think....awesome! Also the pickle bar is an excellent add on! Craft beers galore to choose from. Next time 8m up that way gotta go back"}
{"text":"The Lola burger takes your standard 'bacon burger' one step further by adding a fried egg to it (along with pickled red onions, cheese and mayo).  It sounds like breakfast and lunch served in one massive helping (bacon and eggs plus a burger) - and it definitely looks like it - but it is capital G Good.  Word to the wise:  before picking it up, cut it in half.  And once you pick the half up, keep a firm grip on it because the gooey yolk will coat everything (in deliciousness!) and the burger will fall apart if you let go.  If you still have room after eating your burger, try the fries - once you try them you'll believe that all fries should always come coated in sea salt and rosemary."}
{"text":"Oh my, soooo good! All four of us were in love with everything we tried. Definitely have a milk shake. I had the chocolate banana marshmallow, it was fabulous; but my husband had the flavor of the month, peanut butter brownie. Holy hell! This was the most amazing milk shake I've ever had and everyone at the table agreed. Lola fries are a must  just the simple addition of rosemary made them so delicious! And the burgers...a wonderful assortment of options from their own creations to a build your own. Service was fast and friendly too. A great spot!"}
{"text":"Great burger, Lola fries, Lola ketchup, pickle bar and orange creamsicle milkshakes. Reward for a terrible bowling series. Very laid-back atmosphere."}
{"text":"The burgers were ok. The milkshakes were amazing. I had a vanilla bean apple pie and bacon and my niece had a s'more milkshake. The bacon in the shake sounds crazy, but it works. The s'more shake had a hunk of marshmallow on top that was toasted on top that was so good! My buddy has said the brats are better than the burgers, so next trip the update may be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place because everyone in Cleveland loves Michael Simon. The burgers here are just so-so, and for the price point you could get better. I have to say that the bun is usually the best part of the sandwich. The Rosemary fries are just OK, the portion of fries for the cost is very small. The onion rings are very good though. I give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but the regular burger didn't taste fresh. I don't know if I would go again."}
{"text":"Overpriced milkshake. Happy hour is good. Only $1 for Lola fries and $2 per slider."}
{"text":"B-Spot (east) is becoming one of our favorite places. Great bar food, beer selection and awesome milkshakes, very reasonable prices, hip casual bar vibe. Wish it was a bit larger to accomadate the clientele, but no complaints otherwise.  This was our second trip. We had a great lunch there a month or so ago. With an hour wait quoted (ca. 7p on a fall Friday), we sat right at the bar instead and ordered quickly. I'm sure the wait wouldn't have been as long.  The bar seating was a bit tight but worth the trade off. (If you don't get a seat inside, there's some fun picnic table patio seating in season, or you're forced to sit just outside the restaurant in the Eaton shopping center indoors, sort of like an indoor patio...not ideal but quieter than the restaurant.)  My wife was in the mood for a brat, so she got the night's special ($6) - a large, juicy brat served open-faced on a bakery sausage roll with a warm topping mixture of cabbage & noodles, apples and bacon, drizzled with house-made horseradish. She added a side of his famous Lola fries ($4), a cup of shoestring fries seasoned with rosemary and sea salt.  I got a cheeseburger ($7) with provalone, lettuce, tomato and red onion (they had a wide variety of cheeses to choose from). There were plenty of great-sounding gourmet burger options, but the pickle bar and the variety of 6 house-made condiments were more than enough to satisfy my taste buds. The burger was top-quality, reasonable size (large but not insane), cooked exactly to spec, and served on a bakery kaiser roll.  I ordered a side of the onion rings ($5), a large basket which was more than enough to share - thick cut, batter-dipped, golden brown. The waitress confessed this was one of the few items not made in-house (I'm guessing Gus'?).  I had a draft beer (Great Lakes Nosferatu, $5 pint) from there extensive beer list - tons of drafts and cans/bottles, mostly crafts and imports. They seemed to have a large wine and liquor selection as well.  For dessert, we ordered his famous milk shakes (to go). My wife got a root beer float ($5), which included generous scoop of Mitchell's ice cream.   I got his signature Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake ($5), awesome on so many levels! I couldn't finish mine, even a few hours after my meal...but tried anyway. Great vanilla bean icecream with generous amounts of what seemed like apple pie put through a fod processor with bits of fresh cooked bacon too. Salty/sweet, gotta try it. (Last time we shared a chocolate banana marshmallow shake which was great too!) The to-go size was large but managable, while the eat-in shakes are large enough to share.  All in all, for $40 plus tip, we had way too much food just the way we liked it and we were in and out in about 40 minutes on a friday night. Had we scaled back on the food a bit we could have easily been stuffed for $25-30, a real feat in that area.   We can't wait to go back. Nothing about B-Spot or Michael Symon is overrated in our opinion, at least not at the time of this writing. I hope his new Strongsville location lives up his eastside status."}
{"text":"It was good. Not great. But good. It's like Five Guys but a bit more classy. Burger was very good, but short of great. It needed a lot of salt to add flavor. The fries were very good, but not great. We went about 130 pm and there were many open tables, yet it still took a long while to get our food, and even longer for the check. I've had better burgers and better fries. It's worth going to and I'd even go back but it's nothing I would crave and have to have."}
{"text":"All around good food. Options for gluten free. Ask the waiter/waitress about dietary restrictions. They have a helpful dietary card. Burgers are amazing. Make sure to check out the pickle bar. All around great experience. A must try!"}
{"text":"Good service. Great burger and the chicken sandwich with mayo arugula and avocado was fabulous.  Negative: in the mall. Mall carpet vacuuming next to table not a great ambience-enhancer.  Ugh."}
{"text":"We have visited several times. Burgers are ok, not the most flavorful meat or grilling, average at best. Fries are consistently lukewarm. This seems to bother me the most, I don't know why. It is a routine now. We order dinner, ask for warm fries, they serve dinner with cold fries. My kids, hungry, are fine with the cold fries, I order order hot fries, when dinner is done, I am served hot fries as if they had done something special. Really? How about getting it right the first time? Especially when we make the request? Why try to pass off tepid?  I don't think they have thought this through. Selling burgers in Ohio is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess they don't care or have little pride in what they are trying to do.   I can think of a dozen diners between Cleveland and NY that can run circles around B Spot.  Good shakes. Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great onion rings. Wonderful apple pie bacon shake. Good service. Friendly crowd!!"}
{"text":"Ordered burgers medium well, came out dark red, manager verified they were undercooked and took money off bill."}
{"text":"My favorite there is the seasonal milkshake - Pumpkin Pie.  As the wait staff will tell you, they actually blend up a piece of pumpkin pie and it is delicious!  If it is any time other than November, you still must go there for the burgers and Lola fries!!  Those are delicious as well."}
{"text":"It's ok. Just okay. Frankly, I'm getting tired of this burger thing. I mean, it's a freaking hamburger. Been around for a while. I have to say, the best ones I've had are 1) at home made by my mom (smash style on a griddle) or dad (on the grill); and 2) at greasy spoons: Diner Grill (Chicago); Greasy Spoon (Adair, IL); Roe Boat (Macomb, IL), etc.  Simply, beef patty, American of cheddar, pickle, onion... maybe bacon (but, if the beef is beefy and good, it doesn't need bacon). Lastly, the bread. A basic white bun. Fresh and warm. This brioche bun at B Spot was dry and crumbly. A burger is basic, but it needs to be basically good, with all parts working together. Specialty burgers.... Don't need it. Keep it simple... And greasy!"}
{"text":"Service: I feel like our server pronounced the name Brian kinda weird, just putting that out there. He also used the 1st-person possessive to describe all of the menu items, which our party had split feelings about. Some us felt that it added familiarity to the experience, like he was taking ownership of the food and we appreciated it. But also, are they really your specials? They got one of the orders in our party wrong and were super apologetic about it and gave it to her on the house. They really went above and beyond. We are pretty sure that they were filming an episode \"Undercover Bosses\" actually. But either way, it was very sweet, and made us feel a little bad for making fun of the Brian pronunciation.  Decor: Sort of industrial pop or rustic/retro with a cowboy flare.  Food: The burgers we very good, we'd expect nothing less from the genius mind of chef Michael Symon. And we loved the pickle bar thing, like we literally could not wait to try it before our food came. Don't go for the salads though, someone in our party had to pay like $15 for a \"just okay\" salad with chicken. And she was not into that at all. The milkshakes are expensive but tasty and very generous, enough for two.  Thank you Brian and \"the Chew's\" Michael Symon for a culinary adventure!"}
{"text":"Burgers are my favorite food in the world and I think B Spot really does an amazing job with it! They have this impossible burger (not made with meat) and it surprisingly taste like meat! I also had an actual burger and it was super juicy. My favorite has to be the rosemary fries, it's crispy and thin with a nice spice to it. They also have spiked milkshakes which I HIGHLY recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I love love love burgers and B spot has got it to perfection! Their burgers had flavor and I absolutely loved their Rosemary fries. Would/Will definitely go back whenever I can."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of reviews so I will keep mine short.  Pros: Really, really good burger, decent selection of beer.  Cons: In a mall (not great ambiance), diminutive wine list  I would come back but not before I try the other burger place in town. The burger is really good though just everything else had me feeling meh."}
{"text":"Let me first off say that I'm a burger freak and have had many many burgers in my life. I must say B-Spot are the best burgers I ever had. Their old happy hour was the best. But now they don't have the 5 dollar burger instead they have sliders now for $1.99. Not a fan of the new happy hour but still the specialty burgers still keep me coming here and the 3 dollar craft beers and 1 dollar fries are great as well. Would rank this 5/5 if it had the old happy hour intact. Lola burger is my favorite. Also their sauces are really good as well. Just an all around great place, great service, and great food. Love the Crocker park location because of the patio outside."}
{"text":"B-Spot probably makes my favorite burgers in Cleveland. The meat has great flavor and is never dry. I love the creative toppings, and the pickle & pepper bar and sauces are awesome. Tony Packos pickles are a nice touch. But my favorite thing about the burgers is that they aren't HUGE. What's the point of getting an obnoxious burger the size of your head? I never finish it, and it's gross reheated. B-Spots burgers are the perfect size that I can finish and be completely satisfied.   Let me throw in a quick word about the BLT. This one may be overlooked because it's a burger joint, but do try it. It's a great BLT, with thick cut bacon and their wonderful shasha sauce. And from what I hear, the brats are delicious as well.   The milkshakes are terrific. Don't bother with adding alcohol to them - you don't taste it, you're not going to feel it, and it's an unnecessary expense. Try one of their many beers and cocktails on the menu instead. Service is great - they carry a portable device that gets your order in and takes care of your bill immediately."}
{"text":"burgers are ehhhh okay. cute, funky decor and the pickle bar is super quirky though. worth going at least once!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service was great, the workers were very friendly and attentive. I had the Bambino Burger and being from Cali I thought I would never taste a burger better than in and out but B spot has me convinced. Great service and the BEST BURGER IVE EVER HAD."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! If you don't like burgers, there are some other options, but not tons as meat is king here. The chocolate banana marshmallow milkshake is divine and enough for two. Lola fries compliment meals quite well and you must visit the pickle bar."}
{"text":"Solid burgers and a little cheesy but fun. If you're into burgers, beer, and pickles you'd love it. Limited veg options or options in general but whatever, if you're going here you're probably getting a burger anyway. I don't think the fries are worth it so share a milkshake instead."}
{"text":"The \"rules\"are getting a little out of hand.  I asked for a side of shriracha mayo and was given a lecture about the rules with a slight sigh and then told \"I'll see if the kitchen will let you have it, but you'll have to pay for it if they do.\"  To which i said \"I'll pay $5 dollars for it. I just want a side of shriracha mayo\".  We were afraid to ask for water after that.  C'mon Chef.....time to X the rules and learn from BK.....we want it our way. Yes, you now have build your own burger, hooray! But get a grip on requests for the little things LIKE MAYO!  Wanted to try the French Onion burger but couldn't cause I'm not allowed to order it without horseradish.....  You're making it way too difficult to eat!    *posted with a light hearted spirit, but in all seriousness!"}
{"text":"I literally go to B Spot once a week now. And I have officially tried every burger on the menu! If you have not tried the Fat Doug you are REALLY missing out. Regardless - whatever burger you get, you will not be disappointed. I look forward to trying some of the other menu items now that I've made it through the burgers. Shakes are great, service is awesome, and Happy Hour is probably the best in town. $5 burgers .. .can you beat that??? Go. NOW."}
{"text":"A Michael Symon restaurant.   Holy sweet balls, this place was amazing!  Awesome full bar with seating and about five flatscreen plasma TVs, a pickle bar (the hell???), and the servers don't use pen and paper to take your order. They walk around with their own personal hand-held devices to take your order, send it to the kitchen, and even cash/check you out with. So rad.  Our server was (thank God) knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations.  I had heard of this place, but I was skeptical to try it, as I had heard it was a vegetarian place (which doesn't make a lot of sense, whatsoever).. to clarify, they offer vegetarian menu items! ANYWAY, let's get back to the BEEF...  I chose the Thin Lizzy burger. Had it cooked medium. I pretty much orgasmed the entire way through my meal. The Lola fries are amazing (sea salt and rosemary, WHAAAAT).  To finish, I ordered the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon milkshake.  I know what you're thinking.. \"Ew.\" \"What the f--k?\"  Seriously? I am big on anything sweet, and even I was freaking out, but it was so worth the bazillion calories I drank in a span of ten minutes.  It's a thick milkshake, and believe me, you can taste the vanilla, the apple pie, and of course the BACON! They even put bacon bits (the real sh-t, not the crap you buy at Wal-Mart) on top of the milkshake.   Do yourself and your stomach a favor, and go here. I swear, you won't regret it. If you do, then you probably don't have much of an open mind, and therefore, you probably suck. I don't think I would want to be friends with you."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a superior tasting burger look no further than B Spot!   Our burgers were juicy, tasty and just simply yummy!   Add an order of their Lola Fries for a complete meal"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger, you have to visit B Spot! When it comes to service, this location has had the best service of any other B Spot I've visited. Today's visit didn't disappoint! My favorite burger is either the Lola or the Thin Lizzy. Add the porky fries & your meal will be complete!! Make sure to ask what the seasonal shake is and if you don't like it, you HAVE to try one of the other flavors. You won't regret it. This is a great modern burger joint that always has us coming back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday with my boys and ex.  Food was great.  There was a wait but they take your mobile number and text you.  Efficient and not carrying around the little vibrator thing.  There were two specials, one was a burger with pastrami and it was a variation from the one on the menu and two of us got that.  I helped my self to the pickle bar prior to the food being delivered the hostess stand will give you a little tray thing to put the pickles in.   Onion rings are outstanding.  One order was split between 4 of us.  There were fries so alone it might not have survived.  Nice pace.  Prices are higher than regular burgers but these are not regular burgers.  There were 6 sauces on the table.  All very different.  I liked the coffee and BBQ.   Fund place.  Fast service.  Not fast food but swift food.  Milkshakes are special there!  Big quantities and clearly quality ice cream. They bring out the stainless container dish it into your glass and leave it on the table so there is another whole glassful after you finish the first one!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Trendy, cool, minamalist, rustic neauveau....it's all that plus.  It's sandwiches, salads, apps, and sides. Burgers, Brats, Beer,....the B Spot. OK, onward...  Stopped in for lunch (early) 'cause any other time is a rather large waiting period. Sat down right away at the bar with friends.  Your order is taken and delivered all-together, even if you ordered an app. That's OK. That's how it works here.  I went for the BLT, my friends got burgers, and we all shared the cheesy parm. fondu w/ chips. I'll work backwards: the cheesy fondu..luv it. The chips were taken out of the frier 30 seconds too soon and the bottom portion was greasy and flimsy, not done. Enough were done, however, to still enjoy it all. My compadres said that the burgers were the best they every had. My BLT? Very tasty, but, the bacon was overdone, tough & chewey. I know it is a challenge to get bacon exactly right when it is the thick cut, wood-smoked variety. I use it at home also, and it can turn out that way at times. But, it was a tasty sandwich. What I really like are the selection of sauces that is available at tables. My favorite, the balsamic BBQ. Runner up...the coffee BBQ. Both are a great addition to a sandwich. The atmosphere is fun, and gathering here with friends in a booth can be a time and place when moments are created. It is absolutely a bright place in a town awash with flacid, tasteless manufactured menus. Thanks for arriving Mike."}
{"text":"I love the Lolita happy hour burger. Go there instead. The same burger appears ont he B Spot menu for $8, so just go to Lolita for happy hour. The same burger for $5.  I ordered the Thin Lizzy burger (grilled onions, cheddar, mayo, pickles). The standard toppings (lettuce, tomato) are not included if not listed as ingredients on the menu! And they don't let you make substitutions or additions! My burger was dry and nothing special.  The chili cheese fries were yummy and good for the price. For $5, a whole plate of skinny fries (my favorite), chili, cheese and scallions. In my opinion, the appetizers are a better value for your money. I did glance over at another table, and the helping of fries did not look so generous.   Overall, not worth it. Go to Lolita for the happy hour burger."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes after ordering, then when the food finally arrived the burgers were under-cooked, the onion rings were over-cooked and hard, and the fries were tepid. The bottles of sauce on the table were nearly empty and we had to borrow from other tables. The manager gave us our meals for free, which was nice, but the experience was pretty bad and we won't be back."}
{"text":"A little depressed about moving to Cleveland and a little depressed that they only place the locals could recommend to eat consisted of the cheesecake factory and melting pot (oh PUHLEEESSSEEE), I was pleasantly surprised to reach B spot burgers, on my trip to the Trader Joes next door.  My parents wanted burgers (yes!), so we stopped here once and came back again on their most recent visit. What I love about the food..is that EVERYTHING HAS PULLED PORK ON IT? What??? TWO MEATS?! YES!   I first got the Red Hot burger. A medium size patty cooked to my medium preference, that was suppose to be \"spicy\" with its sriracha mayo. Totally not spicy, but I thought the burger was solid. The next time I went, I got the schroomage. Mmmm. Mushroom. That was pretty solid. I still want to go back and get that Lola though!   My dad ordered the plain jane....and he said it was alright. If you go here though, definitely order something more unique! My mom got the Mr. Porky. The bratwurst was HUGE. Bratwurst plus pulled pork? For only SIX BUCKS?!! What a steal.  I had no clue who Michael Symon was (dude, I never had cable tv in grad school!) until friends mentioned him, and I later realized, that this place was HIS restaurant! I knew it was too unique. haha. Cool place to stop for a solid meal..... if you like meat like me. :) Just the right amount- not too much (I ate the whole thing...and that says a lot), and not too little. Solid."}
{"text":"The Lola Fries are worth the price of admission. Everything else is decent, but not great.  I had the Red Hot burger, which features pulled pork, pepperjack cheese, pickled tomatoes and jalapenos, and sriracha mayo. It's not that spicy or particularly flavorful otherwise. It was filling, and that's all I'll say.  What I was really excited about was the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake. It was a unique concoction to say the least, and I probably spoiled it by adding the bourbon. The bourbon totally overwhelmed the shake's flavors, leaving a soupy dairy/boozy mixture. Next time I will be getting it virgin.  Like I said, the Lola Fries were the best part of my meal.  I'll be back eventually, but I think I'm going to stick with the basics next time. No booze in shakes and not one of these crazy burgers. All the extra stuff just tends to complicate things."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty decent, but possibly overrated a little bit, but I'll have to admit that the burger was very well cooked. They never under or overcook the burger and they did a good job maintaining it's juiciness. The sunny side up burger was just so great that I would just bite in the burger and let the yoke run down my face and lick it all over haha.  One fun thing that I like to do is to order some lola fries - they are not that special unfortunately, and try the six different kinds of sauces available on the table. I bet you will find one sauce that will make you pretty happy. I heard their milkshake is pretty good too - like bacon milkshake, etc.  A little pricey but not a bad place to go for burger lovers who would like to dine at a fancy place!"}
{"text":"Best burgers shakes fries bourbons and beers in the US  Michael Symon  has created anotherCleveland gem"}
{"text":"B spot not only serves burgers but brats and bologna (hence the B in B spot!) The prices seem a little higher for burgers but the brat prices are reasonable.  The thing that I liked about B spot was that there was a roll of paper towels and a basket of sauces on the table, kinda like Famous Dave's. I like this because I hate having to ask for more napkins or more sauce. It's so convenient that they have it there so you can get it whenever you want without having to wait for someone to bring it to you. They had 6 different sauces: 2 types of mustard (regular and stadium), 2 types of ketchup (regular and Lola), Coffee BBQ, and balsamic steak sauce.   They also had a pickle bar which I thought was great because I love pickles! The pickle bar consisted of: Dill pickles, Tony Packo's sweet pickles, banana peppers, jalepenos, and pickled onions.   For the appetizer, we got chili cheese fries which was a pretty big portion (but then again, it did cost the same as a cheeseburger). The fries were shoestring, skinny type fries and came with enough chili on them.   We tried the Clevelander and the Lola burger, which the waitress said was one of the most popular burgers. The burger came with a fried egg, bacon, onions and cheese and was pretty good.  The Clevelander was a brat that was served with fries that had hot sauce on top.  It was very flavorful, maybe because of the hot sauce on the fries. The only downside to the brat was that it was a little raw in the middle. I like my meat cooked well so the raw brat was a bit of a turn off."}
{"text":"A family favorite generally (we are regulars), tonight they had an epic fail.  They served my daughter's special burger complete with the small paper dispensing cup (which had held the burger's cheese sauce) smashed into the bun.  It neither tasted good nor looked too good, even if it offered extra fiber.  And the advertised prosciutto had been substituted with pastrami.  My burger had no extra meat at all, neither prosciutto nor pastrami.  They agreed to comp a burger and a shake, but the bill they delivered was only for the burger and shake - a bill I should have paid:  when I pointed  out the error they gave me another, much higher, bill.  WAY below standards for Michael Symon."}
{"text":"The food is very good, especially their vegetarian burger. The only thing I have to say is that the prices are a bit high for my taste but understandable given the affluent area in which it is."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. Best milkshakes ever!!!!!! Newby to Cleveland but will definitely be back. Bartenders do a great job and they have a awesome beer selection. Michael Symons does it right. Can't wait to check out his other restaurants"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner, but made sure we went super late as I've heard wait times for tables are long. The place isn't that big and I guess its new so people love it.   We tried a brat as well a burger. I actually liked the brat more. GREAT brat. That being said, the burger was pretty good too. Yummy grilled onions on it. Also liked that the burgers are a normal portion size, not a standard midwestern monstrosity. They also don't come with a huge pile of fries. Another standard midwestern practice. They seemed to have a pickle bar up in front, but I'll admit I was too lazy to go up and check out it. Burgers were good without.  They've got a little bar area as well which could come in handy if you have to wait for a table. Prices were very reasonable. They also have some great cocktails if you like bourbony types of cocktails. Most weren't quit sweet enough for me.  Would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Oh yea.    -Good burgers.  Small, but good. -$4 lola fries.  $5 O-rings have bigger portion.  Both were great.   -No wait for lunch.  Stop going to a new restaurant at 6pm and complaining about the hour long wait, idiots.   -Great, fast service.  Loved the portable computer the servers bring to the table.  That way, you know your order is in as soon as you say it.  (As a server, this would be very convenient and eliminate those forgotten orders...)  They even swipe your credit card at your table.   -Limited menu, so substitutions.  Suck it, it's good."}
{"text":"Located at Crocker Park which is a nice shopping and residential area. B Spot was very busy when I went during black Friday. Its a Michael Symon restaurant so thought I'd check it out. It has a good atmosphere and seems like a popular restaurant. Fortunately, we were seated immediately on arrival.  Ordered pulled pork sandwich. None of the burgers or sandwiches come with fries so had to order separately. Honestly, its just a regular old burger and beer place. Pulled pork wasn't that special. Everything was a little pricey. They do have a good beer selection. Not the best burger joint Ive been to."}
{"text":"my first visit to Be Spot with my fiancee and we were not impressed.  we were seated right away as they were not busy even though it was a Friday afternoon.  The server greeted us right away and promptly got us our iced teas we ordered.  she never brought us sweetener and we had to ask for it when she returned to get our order.  we both ordered burgers mine was the fat Doug and hers was the smashers special.  we ordered fries and onion rings which was a mistake. The fries were pretty good,  seasoned with Rosemary.   The onion rings were really greasy,  they left my mouth coated in oil,  yuck.    The burgers were nothing to write home about and didn't live up to the hype I heard about the food here.   My fiancee and I agree,  the next time we want a good burger,  we will head to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"I ate at the B spot last night for dinner and enjoyed the food. I definitely wouldn't say it's the best hamburger I've had, but it definitely did it's job. I really liked the options to build your own burger, and I think there is a really good menu selection. The one thing that I did not like is that you could not change their specialty burgers in anyway (add or remove an ingredient). Not really surprised by this based on the owner...In the end I built my own burger w/ beef patty medium, provolone cheese, grilled onions, peppers, cilantro,  Sriracha mayo, and fries.  The burger was cooked right to medium and tasted good, but there was very little of the additional ingredients I ordered. The Sriracha mayo was delicious and the fries were alright. Overall did the job as I don't typically go out for hamburgers.  Although the weather was nice it wasn't warm enough to sit on the patio, but it looked like a good place to stop in and eat outside."}
{"text":"The only reason it gets four and not five stars is because we eat in the car, doing take out, because our puppy is with us. The burgers are terrific, done just as you ask. I get a turkey burger yummy as well and the Lola fries are so awesome! Don't forget to try the vanilla bean apple pie bacon shake-wow, so good!"}
{"text":"Average. Way overpriced for what you get. I went with 6 other people and not one person was impressed. I'd take a Five Guys or even Red Robin over this place any day."}
{"text":"It's official: B-spot Chagrin has officially jumped the shark.  Take the experience of mediocre food that I received my last visit and add in poor service, bordering on rude.  My waiter dropped off a beer that was about half full, with the rest foam, then runs away.  Before I could get a word out, my friend calls him back and explained that it is unacceptable that he served me half a beer.  The waiter comes back and explains that the keg is empty and that the beer is free.  But why did we have to call him back to get that message and why did my other friend catch him rolling his eyes?  Ridiculous.  After that experience, we had to close out our tab and leave as we could not trust the guy serving anything else to us that he would not take \"revenge\" on.  In addition, consistent with the cook staff that has a don't care attitude resulting in not properly cooked and seasoned burger the place is filthy.  Check the fixtures in the restaurant and you'll find dust and other dirt.    Where is Symon to straighten this thing out?  I don't know.  Maybe he needs to quit doing appearances on The View and get his restaurant managers back on a short leash before they destroy his reputation.  I do have to note that my friend who ate with my dined at the B-spot in Crocker Park and had a great burger and experience.  The problem seems to be limited to the Chagrin location and not systemic across all locations."}
{"text":"Okay I know this is late but better then never right?    On my wife's pregnancy last hurrah we came to Cleveland and indulged in the city.  Really like Michael Simon as a chef so we tried all his establishments we could.  Ordered:  Bacon milk shake - The reason for the addition star quite honestly.  This was the highlight of the meal....Hands down you gotta get this! Cheeseburger w fontina - Pretty good burger but didn't grab me the way I need to be...haha. Fat Doug - Not bad as well but kinda fell short in overall taste. Chili chese fries - Not my sorta thing.  Overall not too great for me.  I had higher hopes for this place Chef Simon.  Went to Lola the night before too.  Wanted to love this place!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter for daddy daughter date night. Wait staff was great. My burger was spot on in flavor. Table BBQ sauce lacked flavor. Onion rings were a total disappointment. Not homemade and leaking in soggy grease.  My daughter is 7 and a very tiny kiddo and she was disappointed in the kids burger. It was extremely tiny and almost no meat. I should have ordered her an adult burger. Her fries were excellent. Kids meals come with a cup cake at the end. One, had to remind wait staff to bring it, but they made it sound amazing. When it arrived my daughter laughed. It was this store bought micro sized cupcake with Giant Eagle level frosting. An utter embarrassment for a place that prides itself on high quality food. She took one bit and said it was disappointing. This kid watches chopped Jr a lot and said as a judge this place would get chopped for this meal. Again, not all was negative but we expected better from a Michael Symon establishment."}
{"text":"Mr. Symon apparently forgot that we had an imaginary date to meet at B Spot. I showed up with my friend thinking for sure he'd be in the kitchen slaving away ready to meet me. Sadly no such luck. It's OK Michael; I still love you...or your food anyway. I love it so much that I might just HAVE to visit it every time I come home to OH for a visit. Yes it's that good. So good that I hope you come westward to Chicago and open a restaurant. So good that I am salivating just writing this review...  What's so good you ask? Everything. I love the rocker/biker decor. Sure they don't take reservations so if you want to sit in a booth prepare to wait. But why sit in a booth when you can sit in the middle of the room at the bar and chat up your friendly bartender? You have a great view of the room and plenty of space to oogle at your fellow patrons.  The food...ah yes, the food. Well, let's start with the drinks. The milkshakes to be exact. They're divine. I would have to say B Spot rivals Tommy's for the best milkshakes in Cleveland. A bold statement - I know. With flavors like vanilla bean apple pie bacon (they use frozen apple pie and work in the bacon after its been cooked to a crumble) and chocolate espresso you really can't go wrong. Next work your way onto some sea salt and rosemary Lola fries (love the thin frites as opposed to the thicker fries) and you're almost there. You want a salad? OK, fine they have those and they're pretty substantial, but you're crazy if you're not going to B Spot for a burger. At the recommendation of our friendly bartender I ordered the Symon Says complete with bologna. This juicy burger was worthy of the knife and fork that accompanied it.  Love, love, love. I really can't say enough. Even being there in the moment I kept saying how much I loved it. I can't get back there soon enough and wished I could have made 2 visits in my 3-day trip home."}
{"text":"You guys, there is a PICKLE BAR at B Spot. A PICKLE BAR. I am not sure I can overstate how excited I was to walk in the door and see all sorts of exciting and delicious pickles, which I believe were all house-made or local (Tony Packo's WHATT?)   When my husband and I spent 24 hours in Cleveland for work, we decided to go on a food pilgrimage of sorts, and of course we couldn't call that complete without visiting one of Michael Symon's restaurants. We'd had a great dinner at The Greenhouse Tavern (which is not a Symon restaurant, but one he recommends, incidentally) and were looking for something more lunch-y when we left Cleveland proper. B Spot it was!   The burgers and fries were both pretty good, as far as those go; I ordered a standard cheeseburger (The Thin Lizzy) and my husband got their bruschetta burger. Obviously I high-tailed it to the pickle bar and piled my bodyweight in pickles onto my tray, which meant I could only finish about half my burger...   I did find a hair (or something) in my burger about halfway through, and when we brought it to the server's attention, she fetched the manager who apologized, offered me a new burger (or shake, or whatever I wanted), and when I declined, they took my burger off the check. Unfortunate circumstance handled super well.   If we're ever back in the Cleve, B Spot would certainly be a contender for a return visit!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and the best fries that I have ever had! Love that Rosemary! I follow Michael Symon's recipes and love to watch him on the Chew! This was not a disappointment!    You must try the pickle bar! He uses local Tony Packo's brand and they just make the burgers pop!   It is usually quite busy but I guess you would expect that for a good burger!"}
{"text":"I like all kinds of burgers... thin, greezy bar burgers (RIP Knotty Pine) thick,  rare, black angus burgers burgers with crushed doritos mixed in (don't knock it until you try it) a hunk o' meat thrown on the grill, with a nice char  ...but these burgers are kind of... meh.  What is it about these that is so underwhelming?  They are very, very  juicy.  That is usually a plus.  They are a goodly size.  Again, a plus.  The toppings were not copious, but very tasty and well edited.  Fantastic.  But when one bites into a burger, it should  announce itself boldly as BEEF!  This one didn't.  In fact, it really didn't taste like much.  Blandish.  Weird.  Could it be that even though the menus, walls, servers and decor educate the teeming unwashed as to the color, doneness and temperature of each degree of cooking, none of the burgers actually come out as ordered?  I ordered medium rare-- got a burger with a warm pink middle.  My daughter ordered medium and got a cold red middle.  Husband ordered medium and got medium well.  If you are going to be that big a snot about it, at least attempt to follow your own rules.  Speaking of the rules.  The rules themselves are not complete douchbaggery.  No subs, all parties must be seated, all food comes out at once,  yadda, yadda, yadda.  Printing them on a card, then claiming that anyone who finds them douchbaggish is uptight IS, in fact, douchbaggery.  If you are going to take yourself and your burgers seriously enough to print this dreck, at least make a damned good burger.  The fries are really good-- Lola fries.  The homemade chips and Parmesan fondue were the best thing about the meal. The pickle bar was pretty cool, but aside from the gonzo pickled green tomatoes, there was nothing you couldn't get in a reasonably good grocery store.  So yeah, I'll go back to Lola and Lolita when I want my Symon fix, but I will pass on this."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just okay. The location can not be beat - I love people-watching at Crocker Park.   I think the art inside (the big beercan collage) is pretty sweet.   The complimentary pickle bar was good - the kimchi was perfect and stinky... which means it's been aging for awhile. A good thing, if you ask me!  I'm wary of any burger place that doesn't include fries with the burgers."}
{"text":"Don't understand how this place gets 5 stars.... I had so much expectation because I do enjoy watching Micheal Simon..... Unfortunately the food was to be desired.   The menu is small and food is expensive for what you get.   The burgers aren't seasoned so they taste like nondescript places.   The bar of pickles was kind of cool and they were decent.   The best thing we had was the pulled pork on the pork rinds....     I just am disappointed the burgers were that bad.....  The atmosphere was fun though.   I liked the decor and it was a Browns Sunday... So that is always entertaining....."}
{"text":"Don't find this Place be particularly special.  I've had many better burgers at various dive bars.  I think this place is over hyped just because of the owner.  The toppings for the burgers are creative, but beyond that they are small for the price and are just average bar burgers.  It's clean and the service was good, but MEH, not a place that I would look forward to going back to."}
{"text":"People seriously like this place? Blind fold me and give me a McDonald's burger and a B Spot burger and I couldn't tell the difference. Basically they tell you \"Here try our special sauces and you'll feel better about paying $15 for something that should cost $5.\" Classic lipstick on a pig situation. Always a wait and always terrible service."}
{"text":"Pros: sriracha mayo, less expensive than I thought it would be, cool atmosphere?  Cons: tasteless and weird veggie burger (eating vegetarian doesn't have to taste like nothing or have a weird consistency, I've had plenty of veggie burgers that are crazy good. It's not that hard), grisly beef burger  Overall, disappointing. My dad and I were looking forward to some gourmet, delicious burgers. I expected more. Also, I saw the bartender making drinks and he looked lost. He was throwing ice into the glasses and missing. The drinks were only half full. I bet they were $10 drinks and they barely had any liquid in them. Also the fries were nothing special, about Steak 'n Shake quality or less."}
{"text":"A lot of people tend to forget about a 'novelty' spot after it's been open a few years, but I guarantee that B Spot is far more than novelty. At this burger joint, you get excellent burgers, premium beef, a wide (but not confusing) menu and DUH a pickle bar!  I've tried a few different burgers (I like the Yo a lot) but on my most recent visit, it was the Thin Lizzy. Don't let the name fool you, this is not a fast food patty. 6 oz of perfectly seasoned and cooked beef, topped with caramelized onions, cheese, mayo and pickles. I like to add a pickled green tomato from the hot spot (aka pickle bar). The bun is soft and chewy and never soggy.  I'll agree with you that it is a little pricey, considering you don't get any side dish. For me, it's worth it.  The milkshakes are delicious and creamy and the onion rings are the best in town. Personally, I am not a fan of rosemary so I don't love the fries, but without the seasoning they are good shoestring fries. When is this rosemary trend going to be over? Excellent beer selection and I love that they serve Pepsi products.  Service was friendly and food came out super fast. We left happy and full, but not over-stuffed."}
{"text":"F- spot worst service waited 15 min just to get to order then waited 25 min to get food which we never got. Could not get anyone to help! We just left and won't be back. By the way the one in Cleveland Airport was fantastic great burger great service."}
{"text":"Second visit and tried the \"New School\" fried bologna sandwich.  Damn was it good!!  Great service as well.  Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"A lot of my friends hyped this place to me so I tried it on 1/20/2014. I ordered the Yo burger, which I thought was meh! It was good but for a $10 burger I would rather go to Swenson's or 5guys, and if you are in the Akron area I suggest IDO or Bob's hamburger, much better burger for the money."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this B Spot for a dinner as I've had a delicious lunch at the one in Strongsville. 4 of us met for dinner before a movie with an hour and a half to spare. Our waiter was tentative and we had our drinks always filled. Our food was a different story.  All they primarily do here is burgers. 2 of us had burgers, 2 had sandwiches. The burgers were a disaster. Both were way over done. Ordered rare and mid-rare. We were both told how they would arrive per the chart at the restaurant. The rare was medium and the mid-rare was well done. I chose to point this out and the waiter absolutely agreed. I opted to get a new burger made how I ordered. We were pressed for time but assured (and it should've absolutely been no problem) that I could get a new mid-rare. The burger came out, the same over cooked way. I ate 1/4 and left the rest as we had to make the movie.  If you are a burger joint, you'd better be able to cook a $10 burger properly. I won't be back to this location. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Solid burger spot with a nice beer list and TVs. Despite the focus on burgers, I didn't think they were special compared to other options. It's surrounded by other bars so this is a great food stop on a barhopping plan."}
{"text":"I do enjoy a burger at B Spot and it's always an energizing place with great service. It's good but honestly, I think Thyme 2 in Medina gives them a run for their money on the best burger in the area."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is. Kind of expensive. I had both the Cracker Park and the one in Weaks-ville. I prefer the Annex Burger in Solon. I like dumpy places where hillbillys gather. The Annex Bar in Solon is such a place. Buckeye Beer Engine in Lakewood makes good burgers. I try to stay away from red meat though. Is the B Spot a play on the G Spot? Does the G Spot exist? Is this a place where gangsters gather? I think that South Central is the best gangster/hood movie ever. Menace II Society had terrible characters and I could care less if any of them died. If I do ever come out with a burger place called G Spot, I will call the best burger the \"OG Bobby Johnson\" in tribute to the lead character in South Central."}
{"text":"Super fast service, great burger.  Very tasty chocolate shake too.  The New Jack Burger makes me happy.  Only complaint I have: the buns aren't grilled or warmed.  At first I thought it was just a single time problem I had at the Eton branch, but I've been to B-spot 3 times now and I've gotten cold buns each time!  So it's a nice sizzling burger squeezed into a room temp/cold bun.  Michael!  Warm up those buns!  (see Eton B-spot review)"}
{"text":"Second best burger in the world (well maybe just the US, since I haven't tried burgers elsewhere). When my tour of Cleveland comes to an end, this place will be on the list of places I will have to revisit  (Lolita also being on that list).    Had the New Jack City and Lola fries.  The fries were good, nothing amazing.  But that spicy chorizo definitely adds a nice kick to the burger.  It's a very meaty burger so definitely not for the faint of heart.  I tried my friend's vegetarian (portobello mushrooms) and it was good, but Shake Shack shroom burger is better if you're going down that road.  Also tried the Lola burger, which is light-years better than the burger at Tremont Tap House; sunny-side up egg and bacon also comes standard (vs. as an add-ons at Tap House) in the Lola burger.  Someone mentioned the price...I think $9-10 for these burgers are a steal! (for comparison: Tap House Burger with aforementioned add-ons is 12.50, Fat Head's Spicy Cuban (also an awesome burger) is $10.  And well, sure, McD's, BK, Wendy's has cheaper burgers, but after all, quality meats come with a [small] price."}
{"text":"Always good. Always left full. Always had great service. Happy hour saves you a few bucks. Things add up quickly."}
{"text":"Such a delicious \"spot\" to have a bite of you are in the Eton area! Delicious sandwiches and milkshakes if you are in the mood for a cheat meal! I could live without the Rosemary fries though. Not to my taste. Also, eat your sandwich fast because the buns tend to just fall apart! They are definitely knife and fork."}
{"text":"Went there last night near closing on a muggy, muggy day. They had the restaurant open to the outside, and it was really humid. Being a beer place, everything was sticky and smelled faintly of suds, and not in a good way.  Every burger our large group had was overcooked, though I ordered mine medium rare. No pink in sight.   The size was fine, and I think the food must be pretty good at usual times. The pickle bar was nice, if you like pickles. I don't.  I also waited the whole meal to get a refill on my water, and when my son spilled water at our table, no one noticed and we had to clean it up ourselves.  Just not a very good experience overall."}
{"text":"Solid 4 burger was OK shake and pork fries were excellent Angela sweetest hostess I've had in my whole trip!"}
{"text":"They had me at the pickle bar.  It's such a simple concept, and seems so obvious when you see it, but why have I not found it elsewhere? Nothing complements a good burger better than the sour snap of something pickled.  And these are good burgers, properly cooked. With those awesome fries -- they maybe a bit too precious for some tastes, but we find them addictive.   We've never strayed from a burger, fries and a shake, but then that's the heart of the menu.   Good as it is, though, it's not worth what can be ridiculous wait times. Don't get me started on the unfriendliness of no-reservation restaurants. Though B Spot deserves four stars for the food, I took one off for that."}
{"text":"Have been to this B Spot multiple times! The burgers are delicious and the combinations Michael's got in there are a TREAT. The drink selection makes me want to visit more; one of the better old fashioned's I've had. The adult milkshakes are a plus, as well. I also thought it would be more expensive than it is because it's one of Symon's restaurants but was pleased to barely pay $30 for two! It's clear that this restaurant is run by someone who knows restaurants (see Michael's rules, their POS systems in every server's hand, seating style). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not at all bad burgers, but there are better options available, especially if you manage to catch a happy hour special. I would have liked for mine to have had a better sear. A pretty nice range of choices, all just a little over $10 for the burgers. I wish I had tried the impossible burger for the novelty. I got a shake as well, and that's definitely a nice portion - you could probably share one. Remember to ask about the seasonal shake too. They have a number of indoor and outdoor seating available, and seats inside the mall area too if you really like people watching. I'd like to come back during happy hour for the discounts."}
{"text":"I like Michael Symon and will continue to be a fan.  Perhaps I'm not the best reviewer of this restaurant since I'm not a red meat eater, however I did enjoy their wings and rosemary fries, (which I've stolen and serve as my own).  I've also tried the milk shake which I thought was very thin.  I will continue to go and will bring friends especially from out of town holding Cleveland's own Iron Chef, Michael Symon high and with pride."}
{"text":"Stopped in just before closing and had a great burger! I recently tried Melt and the Rail and the burger here blew them away in taste and temperature the bun was very fresh.   Service was great but the place was empty so take that for what it's worth!  Down side for the price the burger was a bit on the small side but then again at 10:00pm it was just the right bite!  If you have not been it's worth the time! Sorry no time for pics this time...."}
{"text":"It's been many years since I've been at a B-Spot, and while good, it was not quite as knock my socks off good as I remembered. The one thing that maintained their amazingness is the Lola Fries. There isn't anything better than crispy fries with rosemary. That flavor combo just does it for me. I ordered the Fat Doug burger, which was good.  The mustard was a tad overwhelming at first, but it was tasty overall. The pickle bar also provided some tasty options. I loved the pickles green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Very special place. All the burgers are great....check that....all the food is great here. YOU MUST TRY A MILKSHAKE!!!!! Best milkshake I've ever had honestly. The place is usually busy so I understand what my service is slow."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland from Houston, my first visit to The B Spot. It was great! A real up-scale burger bar with a good selection of burgers plus brats, BBQ (pulled pork, not Texas style) and other sandwiches. The house-made pickle bar is a unique feature. My favorites were green tomatoes and kimchi. Crisp Lola Fries ($1 during Happy Hour). Good selection of local craft beers.   I had the Atomic Burger, which was appropriately spicy and flavorful -- not just hot for the sake of hot. Also had a delicious chocolate expresso shake.   Service was fast and friendly. Prices were fair for the excellent quality of the food."}
{"text":"I usually love B-spot, but since they have changed their happy hour menu, it just doesn't have the same appeal to me.  Instead of full-size burgers, you can order sliders now.  Since I prefer my burger medium rare, sliders are overdone.  And since you pay extra for, well, extras, you might as well get a regular size burger.  Don't get me wrong, the burgers are still very good and the pickle bar is AMAZING, but it's not my go-to anymore, especially with Flemings in the same plaza, which has a $5 burger that includes fries, bacon and cheese.  Of course, I will still come back for the pickles!"}
{"text":"I have no words for this place.  Yummy! Michael Symon knows how to make a milkshake!  Chocolate banana with toasted marshmallow and rum! It's a meal in itself!  Sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly but not to outgoing.  They have speciality burgers like a burger and pastrami sandwich as one. I kept it simple and got the bacon cheeseburger.  Everything a hamburger should be.  Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Good burger spot.  The restaurant itself is a bit of a tough place to get in and out of.  The parking lot of Eaton is out of control crowded, and if you try to hit B Spot over the holidays, be prepared to park in the parking lot across the street.  The restaurant itself only has about 12-15 four top tables, so it's also a little inflexible trying to get larger parties in and out.  The restaurant has a bar with a great beer menu.  I like IPA's so I am in heaven there.  Right in the middle of the restaurant is the \"pickle bar\", which some rave about.  I don't utilize this amenity so I see it as a place that takes up space and a place I have seen customers stick their hands into.  Back to the food.   Good burger for sure. You can choose how you want it cooked.  Several choices of suggested burger specialties.  However, you can't substitute, add or take off any item on the burger as it's printed on the menu.  And if you try to \"build\" your own burger w. minus the one item it comes out way more expensive. They also offer chicken sandwiches, fried bologna sandwiches, brats and salads.  I don't have much experience with that part of the menu.  Another great item on the menu are the Lola Fries.  A big hit at the owner's other restaurants, the thin fries with rosemary are fantastic.  The onion rings also look impressive.  The \"Bad A$$ Milkshakes\" are decadent and filling.  If you feeling up to it, try the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie and Bacon Shake.  So good.  One sad note, they used to have giant chicken wings on the menu, and they are no longer offered. The price is a little high, but manageable.   B Spot is a good neighborhood spot, and I will continue to patronize it."}
{"text":"This was a cool place to eat! Definitely get the Lola Fries! I got the Lola Burger, which was very flavorful. The only criticism I had about my burger was it was a tad too salty, because it overwhelmed the rest of the flavors like the egg and bacon. Definitely hit up the pickle bar."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good beer, amazing Lola Fries and a good beer selection you wont be disappointed with Simon B-Spot.  I normally venture to the one in Strongsville, and unless it lunch time that traditionally no wait and service is great.  As expected the place does get very busy from 11:30 to 1 but since their beer selection is always good, I'd suggest a late lunch with numerous beers so you forget to return to work anywys!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger and some drinks on a guys night out and everything was pretty good. I wish the mixed drink special would have been a bit more extensive but the drinks ordered were well prepared and good taste quality. The food was just as good as advertised. I ordered the porky and it was cooked as ordered and was of high quality. I will come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Disappointing! I've tried B spot 4 times. That's enough chances. I won't go back. Service: poor. Inattentive, way too many errors. Food: just ok. Nice beer selection, but they run out a lot. Price: a tad high Value: low Go once if you're curious. You may not bother returning."}
{"text":"Once I heard that B spot was carrying the new impossible burger I had to hurry on over to give it a try. Just as delicious as the one I had at crossroads in LA. Kudos to #Michaelsymon for adding this plant based burger to his menu. For any vegetarians that miss a burger and a beer, this will tame the craving. Bartender was very knowledgeable on the beers and friendly. So happy to see that a burger joint got food, beverage and service right!"}
{"text":"Don't expect anything out of the ordinary just cause it's owned by a celebrity chef.  They have good burgers, I have nothing bad to say about them. Having a bacon milkshake on the menu is pretty exciting; not something you see every day. And it actually tasted pretty good. I liked the pickles bar too.  But there are dozen of places in the area that serve equally good burgers. And I'm always up for a good burger, which is why I gave them 4 stars. If I'm in the area and hungry - yeh, I'll try it again. Why not."}
{"text":"I had the Lola burger and it was very good I loved the pickle bar and all the sauces on the table. The only reason I'm not giving it  5 stars is because the shakes are way too big I asked the waitress if I could have a smaller sized one and she said no so I didn't get one I was very disappointed  I hope they change this you would think they would make more money if they offered a smaller size no one person could drink it all without getting sick. and they aren't that cheap"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by some people that I work with, so I decided to try it on a weekday evening.   It is conveniently located in Crocker park.  I went at around 7:30 pm, and there were only a few other tables.  I love the beer can wall, but the rest of the restaurant just seemed cheap (or maybe I don't appreciate the 'industrial' look).  The bar area had Michael Symon's book 'Carnivore' on display, so I was relieved to see the option of a veggie patty.   Many of the burger options included some kind of meat, so I opted for the make your own combination and ordered a veggie burger with Swiss and roasted red peppers.  I also had a beer, and was happy with the selection of beers on tap, including Great Lakes brewery.  This food was GREASY!!   I don't even know how it was so greasy, but when my plate arrived the paper under the burger was soaked.  The burger itself was good, but the bun was a little too fluffy.   I noticed the waitress pointing out a condiment bar to another table after I was finished... Wish I had known about that.  Overall, if you are in the area shopping and need a quick bite (or just need to sit down and have a drink) AND you want to say that you ate at a Michael Symon restaurant, this is an okay option.   There are also good drink specials during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Period. I came here several times with one of my exes. The food was good. The prices were a little high. Not to mention they changed the type of beef they used, and the size or the burger to cut costs. The last time I ate here was 7 months ago, and I probably won't ever come back. Needless to say I was disappointed. The only reason I even gave them three stars was because I enjoyed the food on my first few visits."}
{"text":"First things first they tell us its a 30 min wait, and we get in after just 5 mins (good thing) however, its because the hostess up front got the order mixed up and offered us a seat before the 6 parties ahead of us.  We get to our seat and I try order some wings and fries to start off.  Oh no?  We can't?  You say everything comes out at once?  You need to talk to you  manager because we're asking for our wings before we eat a burger?  So the Manager comes up and explains that they have a 1 hour 20 min wait now (hmm I just waited 5 mins to get seated), and by the way its 9pm.  Good lie, and she goes on to tell me it allows for them to keep the waiting down to a minimum.  So, what you're trying to tell me is to eat and get out, do not pass go, do not collect a enjoyable dining experience.  They just want to rifle you out of there as soon as they can.  After we tried to order apps from our server, she went MIA for about 10  mins before coming back (probably because she was hoping her manager, who basically said we don't want you business to handle us).    While talking to the manager I went on to tell her just this past Saturday we were up there with our brother and sister in-law and were able to get the chips and fries before we ordered.  With a deer in a head light look she stared at me and said \"Oh really?  What day was that?\"  We spent 3 hours there Saturday enjoying ourselves with food and drinks.  And now this (horrible) manager wants to act dumb with me. Really?  I could have gotten a better experience at our friendly neighborhood McD's.  Ok, so I cave in and order our food all together...I assume everything will be fresh and hot.  Haha think again.  I ordered the Mr. Porky.  Nice size looks great!  Pulled pork on my brat, Cold...Fail  Pro's: -It's close to come -Nice decor -Good Portions -Great Beer selection  Con's: -Fail manager -Cold food -Horrible service -Can't customize any of your burgers -Incompetent staff  Bottom line: If you just want a upscale McD's or Burger King for a quick bite to eat and go this place is for you (alhtough I think even McD's has heat lamps to give me a warm processed burger...) If you enjoy a nice dining experience and want to have a little fun in life while you're out and not have those who are supposed to be \"serving\" you tell you what to do.  This is NOT the spot for you.  Name should be changed to F(ail) Spot."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I had! Burger is on the small side, but is made up with a favorable taste. Now the fries suck! Plenty of beers on tap. Staff is great. Pick up take out is great. Seating is tight. You can get the pager if there is a seating wait, walk over to book store and wait.   Update: teach the cooks what medium well is."}
{"text":"A great place to get burgers or brats. They also have a nice selection of drinks. Pretty cool vibe to the restaurant. Be sure to try the Fat Doug!  : )"}
{"text":"Sliding...Sliders.  Ok, I get it Happy Hour is for cheapskates like myself but even I won't eat mediocre food. Went to the B Spot this evening and was terribly disappointed. I use to love their full size burger Happy Hour but Michael Simon has given up on that and that's a shame. Not only for the patrons but for the servers as well. Since I doubt Mr. Simon pays them a living wage an almost empty room is not going to line their pockets with cash.  When the Happy a Hour included most of the big burgers the place was packed and if customers were like me the tips were a little fatter given the meal was so cheap.  Instead now they have gone to sliders. Ok...sliders.  Even though they might be cheaper to produce, they should be good sliders.  The sliders I had there tonight were horrible.  So horrible that if I were Mr. Simon I would not want my name associated with them.   Where do I begin?  For starts they were barely room temperature. They only cook them one way...way done. The cheese on them was congealed and the buns stale.  They lacked any moistness whatsoever in meat, cheese or bun.  Quite frankly I've had better at White Castle.  I assume Mr. Simon has no clue what the kitchen is up to because I can't believe any of this is ok with him.  I get that he is busy and all but if I were a chef of Simon's notoriety I would not want to be associated in any way to such mediocrity.  I want to add that the French fries were cold. Not the least warm but cold.  How does a Michael Simon kitchen screw up the basic faire of a fifth rate, hole in the wall lunch counter?  But they did.  Advice to Mr. Simon: If you don't want to do Happy Hour, well fine. Just stop it altogether.  Don't allow yourself and your name to be associated with subpar food.   While I'm no chef, I do like to cook myself. I take my preparation of food seriously. I believe Simon does too.  I would not want my name associated with what I encountered this evening."}
{"text":"This place is fun and has amazing food. The burgers are not your typical combination of flavors, nor are the shakes (which are not to be missed). The options you can add to anything are vast, there's the pickle bar for your food and shots for your shakes. The fries are not to be missed and I've never seen anyone not satisfied with the food. The staff is always friendly and helpful in choosing selections."}
{"text":"Can't beat 2$ brats 5$ burgers and 3$ wine for happy hour! I often meet friends and family here after work for a quick bite during happy hour. Only bummer is it is only until 6! They have a variety of awesome sauces and a pickle bar! Edit: They have changed their happy hour! They do sliders now and I think the prices went up a bit for drinks. Also if you like merlot you should know they do not have it here, they will recommend a syrah that is good but not quite merlot ;)"}
{"text":"A fair midling price for a good quality burger on a really good brioche bun.  Love the pickle bar, and really love that I can get a sunny side up egg on any burger.  How can you possibly go wrong with a sunny side up egg?  The best part for me is that if you order a medium rare burger you actually GET a medium rare burger.  Which these days is, you know, a rarity."}
{"text":"I like B Spot.....My kids like B spot. We all like 5 guys better, but we can enjoy more than one type of burger. So that is all I have to say about the food.  What I have been following is the back and forth about the rules. Some people hate them, some people defend them. But NOBODY has ever sadi \"I like the rules\". So, as a business owner, why would you post rules that will result in one of two things;  1. Have people refuse to dine at your establishment because they hate them, or  2. Have people eat there in spite of them.  When those are your only two choices than it is a bad business model. Of course if I was the king of everything on the food network I might do it just to get a laugh out of all the sputtering haters out there who are just SO offended that they can hardly breath. I guess that would be fun. As a business owner who knows how fast your star can flame out, well, I might want to make as many friends as I could on the way up."}
{"text":"A surprisingly commercial venture from Michael Symon, but still with his signature flair and good food. This doesn't feel like a local joint like Lola and Lolita. I went on a whim with two other people on a Sunday night and I still had to wait 45 minutes to get a table.   Most of the menu is casual food but don't mistake it for ordinary. I got the Schroomage burger which is a regular patty with onions, blue cheese and a portabello mushroom cap. Delicious and juicy, my burger bun had trouble holding onto it. For sides we got Lola fries and the chili cheese fries. The latter is more like a meal in itself, get the Lola fries if you're looking for a burger accompaniment.   Also tried out the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake and it's a train wreck that works. The initial taste is what you expect of any shake (sort of chunky too with what i'm guessing is a graham cracker thrown in) with a salty and chewy end from the bacon. Surprisingly excellent.  As a small bonus, the restaurant features a homemade pickle bar. I'm not a pickle type of person but I went back for seconds."}
{"text":"Good burgers with average service. Had the Lola which includes an egg and bacon. Sounds amazing right? I found it to be very average for such an amazing combo of items. They do have great fries and milkshakes however. Worth checking out if you've never been."}
{"text":"love b spot! delicous shakes and burgers and fries. pickle/topping bar is awesome as is the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Easy review- the food was great and the service was quick.  I had the Thin Lizzy burger. The griddled onions added delicious flavor to an already tasty burger. My husband and I also shared an order of fries and onion rings. I really liked the onion rings- the onions didn't pull out if you took a bite, the coating was crunchy but not too crunchy. Yummy!  I ordered a chocolate shake and it was no joke. Tons of chocolate flavor, plus it was huge! The waiter offered me a \"to go\" cup to take the extra with me.  I will definitely be back. I need to try the Vanilla Bean Apple Pie Bacon shake!"}
{"text":"High expectation of an iron chef establishment ended up unexpectedly flat. While the burgers were good, they did not scream \"I need to be back again tomorrow.\"  I enjoyed the Porky burger.  Great pulled pork, alright slaw, disappointing size!  For an $8 to $10 burger, I expected more. Pickle bar was good.  Best item here-pickled red onions!  By far the best ever found so far! Must haves are the lemonade (fresh made but no free refills). Watch out: fries are not included with the burger, must order seperately. Would I come back you ask?  To try other creations, yes! Must I come back? Better burgers await elsewhere if you know where to look."}
{"text":"My family and I visited B-Spot last night and I can't say enough good things about it! Contrary to many reviews here, I found that the quality of the food made it an excellent value for the price. You can taste that the ingredients are fresh and high-quality. You can also feel it; it is rare for me to eat an entire hamburger and feel energized!   I had the Gobbler - with beef rather than turkey, try it! - and my companions tried the Fat Doug and the French Onion. Each of us polished off his entire meal with smiles and moans of delight. On the side, the onion rings were perfection - fresh, light and crisp, non-greasy, cooked to perfection.  In addition to the fresh ingredients, thoughtful flavor combinations, and delightful selection of sauces, I was also most impressed by the quality of the beer list. It is uncommon to have food so good served with beer so good!   I will definitely be returning to partake in their - almost unbelievably good - Happy Hour sometime very soon. Way to go, Mr. Symon."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I love to do little adventure trips in the great city of Cleveland. On of our most recent get together, we decided to take an out of town friend - who is a big Chew fan- to B Spot. What a great time we had! If you love burgers and sandwiches and a fantastic selection of local craft beers and whiskey, this is your place. Be warned: Michael Symon runs a tight ship and there are no apps here nor can you add to your existing sandwiches. You can remove items, but no adding . We love getting the Plain Jane as you cannot beat a simply made cheeseburger. Also, the Fat Doug is my favorite as well- pastrami and slaw on a burger is divine. The fries are so good, but I will admit the salads are a little sad. Guess You don't come here for a salad.  As for desserts, we always get the vanilla bean apple pie bacon shake and it's a favorite for the whole group. As stated earlier, great beer selection and my friends were so happy with this. The place is always packed and often there is a 90 minute wait. They do have outside seating and that's a plus- we were seated straight away the other day.  Overall, fantastic place to fill that burger craving ."}
{"text":"Perfect portions (seriously). Sides are enough to be shared by you and all your pals.  Friendly servers,  Hungarian pepper sauce, burgers cooked PERFECTLY, pulled pork, vinegar bbq sauce, \"frites\" style shoestrings, beer, refreshing cocktails = all wondercute. The vanilla, apple-pie bacon shake (+Bourbon, of course)??? You have no idea how amazeballs these flavors mesh with each other.  This is a damn good restaurant located near many classic 'Ville gems that prepare their dishes out of cans and freezers.   Count your lucky stars, Strongsville.   Glad I got to see it for myself. My Chef buddies from both coasts have been raving about it, but the \"people\" reviews here are troubling.   Was I afraid of the hype? Yes. But I feared the \"below\" three star ratings more so.   People are smoking the wrong drugs. The wordy essays seem to point to this.   Pickle bar."}
{"text":"The offerings are diverse enough that you could go to this joint a dozen times before you get bored with it. Nothing is a real standout, oddly enough. It's all well-cooked and flavorful. But if you are familiar with Northeast Ohio cuisine, you'll know the rut that this joint falls into: beef, chicken, pork, and lots of carbs. B Spot shows how much room there is for variation within that narrow genre. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I generally feel like anything that could find itself smack dab in the middle of a strip mall, isn't something worth my time.  Alas, I was honestly impressed with B - spot.    My favorite thing about it is that they actually cooked the burgers as you like them.  None of that \"well done\" crap that most restaurants throw at you.   I ordered the Medium Rare, which if you look at the board at the front - means you should be expecting a \"cool center\".  It was PERFECT!    Overall, I've been told about Bspot and with all the hype, I didn't think it could live up to it.  It did indeed though.  It did, indeed."}
{"text":"Thin Lizzy, Pork Fries, Fries with rosemary, pickles, pickles, PICKLES!!!!  Mr. Simon, you know how to yank at a woman's heart strings because I sure do love a pickle bar. Yet, you haven't nailed the green tomatoes, they were a bit too briny for my taste. However, the dill and spicy pickles were absolutely delicious.   A pickle is what completes the burger experience. You eat this savory, juicy, soft sandwich and then crunch right into a pickle... come on! The Thin Lizzy was beautifully pink in the middle, medium rare (the only way to go), cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and grilled onions. Absolute dream in my mouth! Those rosemary shoe string fries were gone so fast, I kept looking around the table to see who stole them! The pork fries were just as tasty but complete with pig piled on top! The best part, the nacho cheese that hid underneath the juicy meat and oozed out as you dug deeper into the dish. MAN! I try to come to B Spot when I'm in town because it's nothing but pure comfort."}
{"text":"LOVE the B-Spot. My husband and I are burger fanatics, and this place hits the mark. I agree with other reviewers that the burgers here are put together the way they are b/c they are DELICIOUS that way. If you want a burger with your own toppings, go to any bar/grill/tavern in any neighborhood in America and order the \"make your own\". This place is not for you. I for one love that the burgers come the way they are. That is the point of coming here...to have Michael Symon make you \"his\" kind of burger. Anyway, now that I got that out, I also loved the onion rings and the PORK FRIES. So good. Perfect to share with friends and some beers before you order your burger. And I found the burger to be totally manageable, not like the towering monstrosities you get at your average chain. Needless to say, after our first experience, on a Friday, we went back on Sunday with friends. So good."}
{"text":"My daughters and I visited to try the Impossible burger. Two vegans and one vegetarian. As noted on the menu, the fries are cooked in lard so we passed on those. Skipped the mayo and cheese (vegetarian daughter got cheese). The only toppings we had were pickles and onions. Didn't know and weren't told the onions were cooked in bacon grease. We'd already starte eating when we realized. The waitress said they weren't but the hostess confirmed they were. After speaking with the waitress the manager said we didn't have to pay so I am thankful for that. Just beware if you avoid meat/pork."}
{"text":"the service is always very good and even though the menu is limited the food is high quality. I enjoy the toppings bar and the veggie burger is quite good. I wish they offered some other vegetarian choices and fries are deep fried in lard unfortunately."}
{"text":"DEAR  MICHAEL,  What were you thinking?  WRONG marketing firm---or were they well-meaning (but zero-experienced) friends? or \"friends\"?   Oh-so-wrong customer approach.  Lovable Chef-Man, give me the opportunity to at least bump up the 2 stars to 3 and the 3 to 4.  I'm cheap, too.  I'll settle for a couple picks off your menu every 4 months or so---no crazy fee, and no artificial adoration that must have exuded out of their every pore, for you to have agreed to this restaurant blunder.    Michael.  Hear me.  Read me.  Somehow.  Someway.  Your take on the Ten Commandments does not bode well.  Trust me.  He'll always get more believers and followers than you ever will coming from this angle. That \"instruction card\"?...a venial sin.  Yes, it's tongue-in-cheek...but believe me when I say that it has backfire straight from Hell.   The results of your playfulness---as noted in comments here and elsewhere---implore the need for a change.  Aside from the very few M.E.H. members (Miserable & Envious Herd) reviews, you risk transforming average human beings just looking forward to a good old burger and beer from a local celebrity chef's joint, into snarking, venom-spewing beasts, too.  And---although a fair amount of visitors would never admit it---even to their closest, most intimate friend---is that of their willingness to stay, though off-put, after reading their \"rights\".  Feeling like willing sheep---but with a gnawing sense of reluctance---they meekly, obediently follow their \"chefherd\".  (couldn't resist.)   With butts stuck to chairs---rendered immovable by their curiosity or hunger---they submissively pick their choices from the menu, while intermittently hissing their dislike of your \"attitude\" and rules under their breath.  Please see the card for what it is---an unappetizing \"appetizer\".    And what about those who just left without ever ordering?  Two a week?---twenty?  Your present approach---by it's very nature and design---begs for negative reactions and the perceived  \"right to whine\" about the FOOD even if unwarranted.  This is not good for business---an angle that might be entertaining only to those who \"get it\" or know you personally---NOT so much to those who don't.  It's like food poisoning.     I see where you're coming from with the \"No Change\" to orders thing.  I feel the same way when I make fried bologna sandwiches at home.  \"No---I fry it in butter, so no mayonnaise.  This is the way I make it and this is the only way it comes.\"    You're the chef (and yours may be the best way) but maybe a little wiggle-room for add-ons?  I've never been in your trenches, but isn't it possibe that the likelihood of an insurmountable number of orders with alterations hitting the line at one time is probably way less than you've already experienced?   Just go for adding a few more employees and risk the sporadic back-up.  Give it a test for just one week.   Gather up all those laminated \"dining guides\" and hide them away where no one can ever stumble upon them, then drape a sheet or something---anything---over the giant chalkboard.    Begin anew by accommodating menu modifications.  It is, after all, a burger joint.  Albeit, of higher quality ingredients than others, but a burger joint nonetheless.   People will be smiling from the tables...probably not even concerned if it takes 20-25 minutes.  They'll just pass the time recalling favorite Food Network episodes and fond memories of you.  First impressions.  We've all heard of having only one chance to make a good one.   As Cleveland's very own Master Chef---home-grown, talented, likeable---I believe that you deserve a second chance to make up for the misguidance, and any misconstrued \"first\".    Your \"Clevelander\".  Perfect.  I'm not one to ever trust a sausage-style offering of any type, but I had total faith in you.  Ground up meats, huh?.... enclosed---and totally concealed from my eyes?---into one handy, convenient unit?...hmmm...  If it's on your menu---I'm going for it.  With your reputation---and my courage---this choice paid off beautifully.  Absolutely delicious!  So, too, with the buttery toasted roll, and those fries.  Enough fried starch for 3 people.   And \"Thin Lizzy\"?---she's really more on the chubby side.   I'm sure she would have been one awesome burger if not for the 15 minute ride home.   I take full responsibility for her continuing to cook inside that well-insulated box---a material that looked and felt like it was formed from asbestos ceiling tiles---more like a take-out thermos.  Next time, I'll eat any burger in-house.     You've been misdirected, Michael.  Love you, man, but give your new ideas---or anyone elses---a week or more of serious thought before implementing.  Stop listening to inexperienced friends or acquaintances---and any foolhardy, risk-taking, uncreative marketer.   Listen to me instead---a perfect stranger.   Yours Truly, Gerri S."}
{"text":"Allison and I ventured to B Spot on Chagrin. After hearing all the hype we were very eager to eat a tasty burger, as we are aficionados of them. We did like the menu and choices of what was offered. We ordered our burgers, i got on with smoked peppers, Allison went with one of favorites, (any burger with egg on it) we forget the names. Anywho, Pretty cool how the waiter was able to send the order right back to the kitchen from the table, nice job on the expedition, needless to say we got our burgers rather quickly. Once delivered, we were surprised on the size. I know im not fat, but this is still America. Is it a Slider? Did we order incorrectly? no its B Spot.   Dont get me wrong they were Delicious, Cooked PERFECTLY, great sear keeping the juices in. The bun was buttery good. I like the pickle bar kinda cool. Fries are amazing, until we were informed....they dont have ranch :( they should put that on the window. we would go back again. But for two people paying over $30 for burgers, fries and soft drinks. Ide go somewhere else, and get more for my money. or if the Horseshoe comps me one :)  Handheld POS..still really cool."}
{"text":"I like this location the best. For some reason the food is made better here. I don't know why that is. Anyways, I am a B Spot fan. MS created an awesome menu and twist to something that has been over done. So has always been nice to see how he freshens up the old burger joint idea. my food has always been cooked perfectly here, burger at the correct temp, and hot crunchy fries (i have been served cold ones before though) service is ok, we sat at the bar so didn't expect anything special.  I usually get the Lola burger, i have a thing for egg burgers. And the Lola is one of the best. Every time i say I'm not going to eat all the fries, and low and behold i can't help myself. they are salty good.   Happy hour is the best, all burgers $5, lola fries $1, brews $3. Less than $10. awesome-ness."}
{"text":"Despite the restaurants famous owner, the food isn't amazing, I've definitely had better burgers elsewhere. The burger was good but not well sized and the fries were average. It's a small place so if you plan on going during a busy time plan ahead. There is a condiments bar if you wish to put more toppings on your burger."}
{"text":"This really is just an average to below average burger. The meat is chopped way too fine and pressed way too tight. Clearly not formed by hand. I've tried to like this place but it's not that great for burgers. Ricks Cafe in Chagrin Falls has a WAY better burger."}
{"text":"My one complaint about his place is the hard chairs. They are brutal. I had to sit on my coat to get some cushion. Moving pass the rock hard seats. Everything else, the food and the serve was amazing. The B Spot was spotless, including the restroom. The pork crackling was actually crackling when it came to the table. The onion rings where good. The special  B Spot catsup  gave a nice accent of flavor to the onion rings.  I got the Gobbler which was a turkey burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, Swiss cheese, avocado & sriracha mayo. Simply delicious.  Don't let the hard seats discourage you from coming.  (They do takeout.) If you come, don't forget to visit the pickle bar."}
{"text":"This restaurant is troubled and lacking any interest in quality. The sandwich I ordered was missing half the ingredients and the parmesan fondue serving is smaller and clearly watered down from what it was when this place opened."}
{"text":"The first place we ever ate in Strongsville. Watch how you get your burger cooked. They tend to under Cook.  The shakes are fantastic and our first one was free, which makes it even better.  We have stopped in multiple times since the summer and have enjoyed each trip. I would encourage you to try everything on the menu. It is all very very good."}
{"text":"I've been to B Spot many times now. We have one certain friend who loves the place and whenever he comes to town, B Spot it is. That being said, I like it!  I don't eat pork products so that limits the menu a little for me, but I've had a few of the burgers. Always cooked to perfection.  I've also had the Zorba Salad for lighter fare, but when I do that, usually I feel like I deserve a milkshake. Never had the bacon shake, but the vanilla one is pretty spot-on. As with all the Symon restaurants, the Lola fries are awesome. I especially like getting them at B Spot since they have so many different sauces on the table to dip the fries into.  The only thing I don't like is that they kind of give you a hard time when you want to swap out burger toppings. Overall though, I'm sure I'll be back. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries & shakes in an environment that is a nice mix of modern and antique ambience.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"So, the burgers are spot on. They always are. The buns melt in your mouth and don't take away from the burger's taste. The fries are... duh. Lola fries. The best fries in the world.   Although... I must say that the quality control has dropped a bit since the first B Spot opened. The burgers come out looking a little undone - not carefully crafted like they used to be. Especially at the Westlake location. Burger patties half-off the bun with toppings that barely made it on the burger. Still tastes good... but ugh.   Ok - here's where B Spot really dropped a star: On our last visit (my birthday) the boy and I decide, along with our dinner company, to order the bacon-bourbon old fashioned! Sounds delicious, right?! Wrong. The bartender must have a) never had an old fashioned in his life b) never learned anything about angostura bitters or c) both of the above. A good old fashioned is pretty simple: Good bourbon, sugar cube, a couple DASHES of bitters, and a *whisper* of soda. Hmmm... This tasted like a sh** show of bitters... it was the most awful thing I've ever had. Like he must have stood there and shook half the bottle in. They are called \"bitters\" for a reason... they make things BITTER. Ugh. Huge disappointment. Someone needs to school that bartender."}
{"text":"Great burger but nothing that blows my mind. I got the Lola burger which I saw a lot of posts about. It was good but not as great as the hype behind it. The sauces on the table definitely enhance the flavors of what you order but too much can overpowering. They have diff ketchup sauces and in house bbq sauces as well. I ordered the onion rings and they were huge. Very crispy but with a smooth texture. Beer battered.   The best part of my meal has to be the Apple Pie Bacon milkshake. Dont knock it. Try it! At first youre not sure what to think but then boom, apple pie cinnamon ice cream goodness and crispy bacon join the picture. You get that sweet apple pie flavor contrasted with the salty bacon bits and its amazing. Great portion of that stuff.  Great staff and service and full bar. Its a great pub style restaurant but nothing super great that makes it a stand out burger place."}
{"text":"I have been back to Bspot twice since my last review. I have upgraded my review from 3 to 4 stars. This time I ordered the pulled pork on the burger and it was delicious. My husband got the burger that was very hot (sorry I do not remember the name!) but he was disappointed and said it was not as hot as he expected. We both ordered alcoholic milkshakes - one of the best reasons to come here! - and enjoyed them. While we were dining, another diner at a nearby table tripped and fell. He fell into our table and hit his head. We were concerned for his safety, as was the staff, but he said he was fine and left the restaurant. When the incident happened, my husband's milkshake fell and spilled all over the floor and the patron. The staff was so helpful in cleaning it up quickly and even gave us another milkshake, free of charge. Way to go, Bspot!!"}
{"text":"I just got promoted to the Yelp Elite Squad, and I'll celebrate by reviewing the best restaurant in town: Michael Symon's B Spot.  Sure, he's got a few rules by which diners must abide. I really wonder if all of the people who have such a bone to pick with the \"rules\" board realize that the universe revolves around the sun and not around them.  I also wonder if these people go up to their favorite musicians or actresses and say, \"You know...your performance was good, but you should do this and that differently to make it better because I didn't like it.\" Would they go up to George Clooney and tell him, \"I liked you a lot in Up in the Air, but your performance was a bit lacking in a few ways, you should do this differently,\" with a know-it-all swagger? Probably not, unless they were a guy whose girl was crushing on him and they were mad at him! I also doubt that they would go up to Slash and say, \"Y'know, your solo in Sweet Child of Mine wasn't bad, but maybe you should play the ending differently because I didn't like the way it sounds.\" Hence, those folks shouldn't have the gall to go up to Michael Symon and tell him how to cook his food, because the man is a genius at what he does. There are plenty of places, such as Burger King, that will allow you to \"have it your way\" and customize to your heart's content All of you who aren't down with Cleveland's Iron Chef can go there and pick and choose exactly what you want on your dry burger. Let me know how that works out for you!  I've had a variety of items here, and nothing has been less than perfect. Not a thing. The shakes are well worth the money, especially the Vanilla Apple Pie Bacon, which is revolutionary. Spend a few extra bucks and get the hooch put in too! As far as side dishes, the chips are fantastic. I thought that it was a bit much to spend $5.00 on chips at first, but let me tell you, that parmesan fondue that comes with them is delish and we've ordered them every time since then.  Let's talk about the focal point of B Spot: the hamburgers. The Fat Doug has won national burger competition awards; after you have one bite, you'll see why. The Symon Says is my second favorite. My wife's had the Chilly Willy and the Philly Whit--both of those were also good. The less adventurous should opt for the Thin Lizzy, which is a basic cheeseburger with some fun toppings. They do have a veggie burger as well.   I've never had the bratwurst--maybe someday! I just can't bear to pass up those great burgers...but I do love me a meaty brat. B Spot also has chicken and salads, I've never had those, and honestly, I never plan to do so. I am glad to eat quasi-healthily throughout the rest of the week if it means that I can eat whatever I want at B Spot!   The wait can be a little long on weekends, especially when cold weather closes down the patio area and there is less seating. Fortunately, B Spot is located right next to Barnes and Noble, Anthropologie, Trader Joe's, and many other stores...so put your name in, do some shopping, and relax for a bit at Barnes and Noble with all of those magazines that you need to catch up on...and you'll be seated before you know it. I am probably the most impatient person on Yelp, and I believe the wait for B Spot is fully worth it.  If you live in Cleveland and you haven't been to B Spot, please do yourself a favor and plan on eating your next meal there. If you don't live in Cleveland, B Spot should be a non-negotiable when you're planning your itinerary. Trust me."}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM!   That BEST describes the B Spot!! A Cleveland favorite, owned by famous TV chef, Michael Symon, this place gets an \"A\" from me!! I love this location in the heart of Crocker Park mall.. This is my favorite place to visit, shop & wander around!  The food is simple -- burgers, brats and beer!!! That, my friends - IS Cleveland at it's casual best!! The burgers are masterfully concocted, but not huge. The portions are not big -- at first glance it seemed meager -- until you take a bite of the food and you realize it is portioned JUST RIGHT. Most restaurants want to gourge you full, so you leave bloated and uncomfortable. But, the B Spot serves you automatic portion control. The famous fries are ala carte -- and they are fresh cut potatoes dusted with sea salt and rosemary. YUM!!   Looking at the quick, one page menu - there is a large selection of brews, full bar drinks, sodas and malts/shakes!!! I tried the chocolate malt -- very full of malty goodness. However, I was very intrigued by the alcohol versions of the shakes. My next stop at the B Stop is sure to include a Kahlua & chocolate shake ... and a brat!!   It's a hip, cool, laid back place inside & out -- and it has at least 3 locations that I know of -- Westlake, Strongsville and a just-opened location inside the new Horseshoe Casino in downtown Cleveland.   The BEST of the B Spot -- aside from the food -- is the PRICE!! I couldn't believe how inexpensive this place is, considering it is so delicious and well-known!! My gourmet burger was less expensive than some burgers at fast food joints!!"}
{"text":"If you're a Clevelander or know someone who is, you've probably heard of Michael Symon and his rise to fame as an Iron Chef. Cleveland doesn't get too many good press mentions, so when someone from our little world makes it big, we're pretty proud. (And, there's only so many times you can talk about Drew Carey or a now-former Indians baseball player in a conversation.) This is Symon's third restaurant, and I'd say it's a decent, but by no means over the top addition to his line. Apparently, he's eyeing chain restaurant-land, and this is his test.  Good burgers are a dime a dozen in the heartland - and that's coming from a vegetarian. Can't say the burgers here are any better or worse than your average upscale burger joint. What does set this place apart from the others is the beer list, rootbeer (on tap) floats, and milkshakes. Yum, yum, and yum. Oh, and they have Symon's claim to fame restaurant's (Lola's) gold star fries, which are a must-have.  The ambiance is nice on the inside of the restaurant - low-key resto-bar vibe. The \"outside\" choices give you a view of the parking lot or the mall. Nothing like really feeling like you're in the 'burbs while eating. Not bad if you're just planning to grab a quick beer and burger so you're not starving before starting your grocery shopping at Trader Joe's. But, if you want a nicer meal, try Paladar or the Lebanese place down the road."}
{"text":"A random family member saw that Rachael Ray chose B-Spot as \"the best burger in America,\" so apparently we had to try it. I went with a group of 6 literally at 5pm. We had a 45 minute wait... My only problem with that is that another group of 6 had already paid when we arrived but the hostess let them linger at their table. I think if a place doesn't take reservations and it's this small, they should enforce some sort of no lingering policy... Anyhow, the burgers are great, but not any better than other Ohio spots like Champps or similar chains. I don't like the no substitution rule... Why couldn't I add grilled onions to my burger? And why don't you have avocado? Avocado is great on burgers! The night that we dined at B-Spot, they were out of 5 kinds of beer, of course those 5 included all of my favorites. Our fries were only lukewarm. The onion rings were AMAZING though.   While I enjoyed my burger, I don't consider this place a must-try whatsoever. Burgers are burgers, Rachael Ray... Unless you're at Minetta Tavern."}
{"text":"Three of us went to B Spot after a day of Christmas shopping. We started our meal with some Rosemary fries and some drinks.  The fries were quite nice, especially with the different sauces available for dipping.  We each ordered a different type of burger and ate family style, toasting to each bite.  We were able to try the Porky, Lola, Blue Cow, and the Gobbler.  They were all fantastic, but I especially loved the Porky and the Lola!  I recommend this to all yelpers!"}
{"text":"If I could marry a restaurant, it may very well be B Spot. I love the Lola Burger. The meat is always cooked exactly how i like it, the egg is just gooey enough, and the bacon crunchy. and good god, the pickled onions!  The sriracha wings are the things dreams are made of, just crunchy enough, not greasy, and just enough spice. Our bartender was also pretty awesome, and there's no wait if you're willing to sit at the bar. Don't even get me started on the apple pie vanilla bean bacon shake, seriously.  Oh and I took home leftover sriracha wings, warmed them the next day, and they were still good! You win, Michael Symon. You make me happy to be a carnivore in Northeast Ohio!"}
{"text":"I went here with the highest of hopes, considering it is owned by Chef Michael Symon. But, it was meh. Don't get me wrong. The burger _was_ tasty. I had the Inferno burger and it did have a kick. However, the \"rosemary fries\" for 3.99 were both overpriced and ordinary, and the milkshake was just a milkshake. I did like the special sauces on the table to go with the fries though. Would I eat here again...maybe, but I have had better burger meals at Red Robin.  Sorry Chef Symon, I have to give you a B-."}
{"text":"Went to B-Spot with some friends for dinner a couple of nights ago.  Loved the casual atmosphere.  The food was delicious, although I'm not a fan in general of thin fries.  The Lola burger (fried egg, bacon, cheddar, etc.) was cooked perfectly and was so flavorful.  I also tried the Clevelander bratwurst, which was pretty good.  They have an extensive beer list.  If you have trouble deciding, they will often give you small samplers.  The reason that I don't give 5 stars is because the beer glasses smelled like dishwashing detergent (needed a bit more of a rinse)."}
{"text":"Happy hour review.  Just went here for happy hour in between meetings so I did not try the whole menu...yet.  From my first after hours happy hour at Lola's when it was still in Tremont this was like deja vu.  Although nothing beats the Symon burger he has now at Lolita's.  He may have it elsewhere but it just tastes better in the original Symon neighborhood.  Its like eating crab cakes from Obricky's in Baltimore in the city of Philadelphia.  Just not the same.  The Sliders were $2 each and well worth it for the half size burgers. Ordered the trifecta slider triange (I got three of them).  Got home made chips with it which I was not expecting.   Then I was pleasantly surprised by the pickle bar which had Tony Packo's sweet dill, green tomato pickles, and other toppings that made you want to try one of each.  The sauces were great and unique: Coffee BBQ sauce, Shasha sauce (banana pepper), and balsamic steak sauce. The balsamic steak sauce container kept on jamming at the tip due to whatever was in it creating a dam for the flowing greatness seeking its meat destination partner.  But as all dams that break, it gushed out.  I was lucky it didn't splatter all over my suit.  I would have released the Kracken on someone there if it did.  Burger/slider above average and was cooked to order.  Bartender was friendly but not one I would consider the life of the party.   I'll give an update when I have some entree's.  Til then come for the beer, stay for the sliders from 3-6pm."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Michael Symon and he up and answered my prayers for a casual burger dining experience. I think the Lola burger has been immortalized as a pretty universal crowd favorite. A decent amount of meat, cooked to order with a gooey fried egg to crown the burger just before the top bun. That is one of my personal favorite but on my recent encounter I went with a \"chick magnet\" and a side of rosemary garlic truffle fries. I even came during happy hour and even though sliders were only $1 a piece, I still wanted to indulge in one of his savory meat concoctions. The chick magnet is obviously chicken, your choice of grilled or fried. I went fried (no use in trying to save calories or be healthy at this point), and I was pleasantly happy with how juicy the meat was. Joining the party was tomato, arugula, avocado and mayo on sourdough. Definitely a hearty meal. DEM FRIES THO! Shoe string cut with rosemary garlic seasoning! Hands down my favorite place for french fries in Ohio. Garnish those pleasure sticks with six types of bottled dipping sauces on your table (regular ketchup, bbq, spicy, coffee infused..Michael Symon does not do anything normal...he does everything with pizzazz. Like all his other restaurants, this one does not disappoint. Oh and for you pickle aficionados...there's a pickle bar in the middle of the restaurant with a delightful array of choices."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place in spite of its location in Crocker Park, I'm not into the manufactured commercial \"neighborhoods.\". But, I will put that behind me to come here.  Since I hate waiting around for a table, I've only been come to the B Spot at low traffic times.  Not easy to do unless you are able to be flexible.     I think these burgers are fantastic.  I don't mind the slightly smaller size, it's prefect for me, I don't need a giant half pound sandwich to be satisfied.  I love the pickle bar, it's nice to add what and how much I want.  It would be nice if there were a couple more options, just for fun.  Another fun bonus are the various sauces right at the tables.  No reason to go with standard catsup and mustard.  My favorite item on the menu is the Lola fries.  I don't think that I've been to a Michael Symon restaurant without ordering them.  I agree that it would be nice if they had a burger/fry combo.  I'm not a big drinker, but a beer goes so well with these burgers.  I don't know a lot about beers, but the list seems pretty good to me.  I would appreciate a few more bottled choices, but I've always been able to find something to drink.  Haven't tried the shakes yet, but I'm looking forward to the experience!"}
{"text":"I had the thin lizzy and my hubby had the Lola. Fries and onion rings were delicious but too much food between the two of us. Great time and great service especially considering it's the weekend before valentines"}
