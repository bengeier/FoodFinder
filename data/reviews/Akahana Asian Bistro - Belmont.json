{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner here. It has a very modern look and a cool vibe overall. When we first got in I had a moment of slight panic seeing several tables dressed in fancy, formal wear. M y party was definitely not in formal attire. Then as all of these younger couples all filtered out at the same time I  realized that it was prom night.  My wife and I brought our two younger children with us which we probably wouldn't do again. Not that this place wasn't friendly and accommodating to my kids, the reason I wouldn't bring them again is this place is too cool to bring small children. It's a nice place, don't bring little kids to cool restaurants, just don't do it.  So, we sat down and it felt like we waited a little too long for our server to come for our initial drink order but other than that, it was fantastic. Our server had that good balance of being around when we needed something but not overly involved.  The food was excellent as well. I had two rolls, the earthquake roll and the sunrise roll. I didn't realize I was ordering two rolls that were fried but that's on me. And anyway, both were delicious so no complaints.   The menu was huge, lots of selection, I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi hands down.  A new restaurant is always going to have some growing pains, but for the freshest, best selection, and delicious sushi in the greater Gaston area this is the place."}
{"text":"TLDR: Fantastic!  We went on a Saturday around 6 pm and were immediately seated. The restaurant has a nice ambience. We got pork dumplings, and they were very tasty. For entrees, we split the Charlotte roll, the crab tempura roll, the Buffalo roll, and the Volcano roll. It was all fantastic and very fresh tasting. We got the tempura Oreos with icecream to top it off, and it was also delicious. Thanks for coming to Belmont, Akahana! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is great, attentive and friendly but the food unfortunately is a big disappointment:( crab Rangoon's barely had filling and the sauce served with it tasted like water, sushi didn't taste fresh and our friend couldn't eat her sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Good sushi but WOW its pricey. Dare night only for me, no more casual Saturday afternoon sushi runs for me."}
{"text":"Ask for Andi...food was great awesome atmosphere...Not sure if there's a better spot for sushi"}
{"text":"This is a nice modern restaurant with good service. I went there before and had salmon with curry sauce, and the second time, seafood sate, both were excellent. I had seen wings on their menu and wanted to try them. I ask which of the sauces were the hottest and the waitress said the green curry. On a Sunday afternoon, I ordered wings with green curry sauce. They turned out to be breaded and they were not coated with the sauce, just had a small dollop of the sauce on top. They were not spicy and the chicken didn't have a good flavor. They tasted like freezer burn. They need to take a trip to Buffalo Wild Wings and take a lesson. Wings are not recommended."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times. Hot and Sour soup is delicious, sushi fresh and filling, dishes range from Chinese to Thai and a little Vietnamese flair as well. Had dumplings once that were not cooked well but they handled it perfectly. We will surely keep this place on our frequently visited list!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of mine and my fianc√©'s favorite sushi places. We have eaten in twice and ordered take out about three times. All of the sushi is made super fresh and delicious. When we eat in, the waiters are terrific. The service is quick and they always have great recommendations. The manager always comes by our table to ask how our meal and service is. We have eaten the Japanese style meals and appetizers, which are also great. Usually I take a box home for leftovers, but I eat everything here! They take reservations for any group size, but we have never had a problem with being seated with a walk-in."}
{"text":"I want to give Sam at Akahana a big shout out! He was so personable and attentive! He even walked our to go order out to us after the meal! He was training another server and answered all of our questions! His trainee was super sweet and seemed eager to learn! The food was on point and fresh! So many vegan options!!! I highly recommend this bistro to anyone, they have it all! Nom!"}
{"text":"Has the sushi and it's very fresh and will not disappoint. Also had the beef and tofu Pad Thai and it was some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Belmont and it was packed tonight.  We waited only 20 minutes for a table.  Our server, Andi (that's with an \"i\" he told us, was friendly and efficient. Even with the crowd they had, Andi took our orders right away and the kitchen was quick to have it out to us.  The food was excellent and plentiful and we plan to go back soon.  We highly recommend this restaurant.  The only drawback is  that it is noisy."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy! We got the golden gate roll and pho and I'd highly recommend either or. A wide variety of different meals to try. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here. Food has been good service was better the first time but the wait time for food and especially sushi to come out is REDICULOUS!!! We waited an hour tonight for a simple California roll and the place wasn't even packed. Very disappointed because I really want to like this place because it has such a wide variety to chose from. May try again in a few more months."}
{"text":"The special combo pho was excellent.  The meats ratio of meat, noodles, and broth were excellent.  Minor critique would be the eye of round steak needed to be sliced just a little more thinly.    Also tried the tetaki and tempura appetizers.  The tempura was sadly soggy on the bottom.  The tetaki was perfect!   Overall, enjoyed the decor, food, and service.  Would definitely return and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a long comment, please read until the end if you want to know why it's long! I went to the restaurant on 4/1, and I waited 20 minutes until someone came and asked for my drink. As i was having a conversation with my friend and playing on our phones. The manager lei long ( Facebook name Karen Long- Chinese)had a sensitive moment thinking that we were recording/photographing her. Based on this she called the owner. A moment later a messenger came, who was the one we knew that currently working there, told us to stop recording her and that the manager felt insecure!!! She also was threatening to call the COP on us. I went to confront her as I wanted to know why? And what's going because we came to eat as a regular customer. Without looking she replied, \"if you continue to talk, I will call the COP\". Another moment later, which was about an hour wait, no food, no waitress had come to take order even though she paid special attention to our table. The rude owner YUNG showed up and approached us saying \"if we were recording the manager, we weren't welcome to eat there\". I complained as we had waited for awhile and the food wasn't coming. He said, \"if we weren't happy with the service we were welcome go to some place else\" without an appropriate apology. What an uneducated and ignorant behavior! We were so confused and didn't know what were going on, why everyone was so sensitive acting insane seeing 2 women and a 3 years old baby came to eat. As the night went by, the manager never stopped by to clarify what she were trying to call a cop on us for. How could a person who is lacking of basic customer service could be a manager? From the owner to the manager are rude and ignorance. Proceeding out the restaurant, we saw the owner was climbing on the ladder to look at the cameras. What a stupid childish act and there were nothing on the record. Later to find out that I knew the owner's separated wife and soon to be divorce, but why would that make her insecure? And why would she be afraid of me? I know that the restaurant is soft opening right now but that wouldn't be an excuse for the TERRIBLE service we had that day!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and immediately asked that the music be lowered.  They did happily.  It is Pat's birthday and we ordered lychee mango spritzer with champagne  We ordered hot and sour soup.  Came in huge soup bowl.  It is delicious and almost authentic.  I would order again.  They boast That their chicken lettuce wraps rivals P.F. Chang's. We ordered and they are wrong.  Not even close.  The chicken was cold and all I can taste are red and green peppers and it was cold.  Lettuce was warm.  Not a fan.  They took it away yet charged us for the plate nonetheless.    On to the dragon roll.  It was OK.  Would not run back for it.  They make a better one at Harris Teeter.  We loved our waiter.  He tried.  Let me qualify all of the above with this statement:  they are only opened 2 weeks and hopefully they will iron out the kinks.  Will come back in a month and will report."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is pretty good there are televisions over top of the bar and booths on the outer edges of the interior the decor is nice and provides a comfortable dining atmosphere. However the food is very bland! It tastes fresh and is cooked well and the portions are generous but the flavor is non existent. I had the sesame shrimp and I have had it prepared with better flavor at a corner Chinese store. The service here is terrible as well I ordered a side sauce to go with my meal ( I had to practically tackle the waitress to get her to stop) and guess when I received it ??? That's right at the end of the meal after the empty dishes had been on the table for 10 minutes here comes the side sauce along with the dragon roll I ordered at the same time as the entree I guess at this restaurant they bring the food when they feel like it. Needless to say to keep with the same flow of the meal the dragon roll was bland just like eating cardboard. I won't return this place doesn't even warrant a second chance trust me save your money."}
{"text":"Great food! I want to eat all the things. Sushi is super fresh and the lettuce wraps are sooo good. Dane was our server and he was amazing, super friendly and knowledgeable. This will be my new spot for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm happy I was finally able to stop by this place after hearing great things. My family arrived on a Friday night around 7:30pm. It wasn't busy, but we had to wait a few minutes to be seated for someone to clear off a table even though there were empty tables that were already clean. Our waiter came by after a little bit of a wait and was very friendly. We ordered the Wasabi Infused Pork Shumai steamed dumplings to start. They were delicious, and definitely did not skimp on the wasabi. I highly recommend them. My daughters are picky eaters so we only ordered them steamed rice. We were only charged $1 for each bowl which was great since they came in large portions and didn't leave them hungry. I ordered the Salmon Donbouri which was served beautifully. Even though it's served in a small box it's actually a large amount of food, so don't be fooled when it arrives. The manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was going well. All in all I was very satisfied with the food and the atmosphere felt more upscale than other asian restaurants. I look forward to visiting again."}
