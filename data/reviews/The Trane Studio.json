{"text":"I love the Trane, and until Nov 30th there is a photography exhibit by Carlos Ferguson called Silent Sound http://www.bradfordphotogallery.com/index.html.  We just went to the opening yesterday, and Carlos' work basically captures what The Trane studio is about.  The Trane is about  jazz, where musicians play off each other and experiment and create something magical.  So go this month and check out the music and the photos. 

The Trane is great, laid back, jazz venue.  The food is wonderful. I almost fear raving about it, because I like keeping it to myself."}
{"text":"Great music, Good food. But... where's the liquor license?

Admittedly, the juices are fantastic - especially the sorrel (tart and spicy at the same time!) - but how about a glass of wine with the (somewhat expensive) meal? And what's a music bar without beer, or cocktails?

The food: high-end Caribbean. Spicy shrimp, jerk chicken and salmon, etc. Lots of flavour, but probably not a food destination without the music. Apps are $9-11, mains $20-22. Can't quite justify the prices for this level of cuisine, especially without wine."}
{"text":"I hesitated what to write for my rating of this place because neither \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" or \"A-OK.\" quite describe it. 

Incredibly difficult to find if you don't know where you're looking because their signage is, in my opinion, terrible. As well, the whole neighborhood doesn't really have their numbers posted for drivers to easily see so we ended up driving past it two or three times before we finally found GoogleMapped (which I had done before I left figuring the address would be enough) and found it's cross street, parked, and started walking.

We were told it was a jazz bar and I am far from an aficionado of jazz but when we got there they were decidedly not playing jazz. I looked online after the fact and it was \"The Franky Rousseau Large Band\" playing the original music of Franky Rousseau, which draws influences from contemporary jazz, electronica, folk, and modern classical music.

It was an interesting evening to say the least. Looked like everyone there was having a good time, I only ended up there because my friend was in town from the UK, wanted to go to a jazz bar, and when I tweeted people suggested it as an OK place to go. I don't know if I'll ever go back because it seems a very hit and miss kind of place.

Bright side: We must have come really late because they didn't charge us the $10 cover they listed on their site for the event."}
{"text":"I wrote a review on Joe Mamas earlier today, and on my stroll home, I remembered the good ol' days when I lived up in the Annex.  There was an incognito spot around the corner of Bathurst and Dupont called \"The Trane Studio\".

Similar to Joe Mamas, this spot hosts some VERY talented musicians.  Less pop, more jazz and world music oriented (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWpldjmLIYA), The Trane isn't as flashy as its King St. counterpart, nor is it as consistent.  That said, check their calendar of events (http://tranestudio.com) to find out what's poppin.  They breed a ton of great local talent (see the YouTube clip above), but don't be overwhelmed if Ursula Rucker, or the Soul Jazz Orchestra just so happen to be playing on a night that you're free.  It's nights like those, when the stars align, and you find yourself in the midst of something VERY special.

I haven't eaten here yet, but judging by the (natural) exposed brick, beautiful art (they constantly showcase local photographers' and artists' work), well stocked bar, warm vibes and plain ol' fresh decor, The Trane Studio seems to understand good flavour."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the music has always been great!  The food is pricey but good, and the martinis are luridly beautiful.  The Trane can be hard to find - it's tucked into a nondescript stretch of street and doesn't have much signage - but it's a cool little neighbourhood club with some great sounds."}
{"text":"Great local Toronto place for Jazz, Soul & R&B. On my last visit they had a Gospel R&B that was well worth the price of admission.

I found the food a little expensive but still quite good."}
{"text":"Great place. I almost don't want to write about it so less people know about it.

It's a secret place.
It's where i go when i'm depressed because it feeds my soul.
It's kinda like a drug because it's always a transformative experience.

The reason you go is Jazz. But the term is loosely used. It can be any kind of jazz. From instrument-less music to North African, to handicapped. 
I love how different it is and how not full the place is. It's like those who know are there. and there's no young hipsters either. just people who are really artists and should be there. 

I hope they get their liquor license back soon though. I went there in jan and found out they were changing owners so still didn't have a liquor license. bummer."}
