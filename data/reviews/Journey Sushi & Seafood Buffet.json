{"text":"Eh. Sushi was mostly rice, not enough filling. Service was very good. Food seemed not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Pros: Great selection of sushi, Chinese, and American food. Good prices. Lunch is about $9 and dinner is about $13. It's very much worth it!

Cons: Service is not the best or most friendly."}
{"text":"To summarize this is just above your all you can eat eateries with the exception of the Sushi Bar with many options. This is a very clean place and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The service was good, our server made our kids balloons animals,  the food....well thank goodness for the pho station cause that was the best part. Everything is simple Chinese honestly bland flavor,  idk why some rate it so high but panda express would been better for myself. Now we did go in 1 1/2 hour before closing so i know the food wasnt rotated but even if they did i still stick to my taste"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a buffet! Quality could go up a little but the selection was tough to beat. Attentive service."}
{"text":"It is not just sushi......I don't eat sushi. I love Chinese food! My fiance and I strive for good atmosphere with great food in Madison, this to me had it! 

Excellent service, fresh delicious food, good atmosphere!  
You don't find buffet style food like this around here that is quality! 

Their was only one thing to say their was so much food, I wasn't able to make it through everything so I will have to go back... and I am looking forward to it! 
I can see the meat and potatoes people not liking it, if you like Chinese food/Seafood great place!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite buffet place in town. The other legendary buffet places were no longer in service when I moved here some time ago. But I am happy we have the Journey Sushi now =)

Other reviews have pointed out specifically the pricing and types of food available down to every detail. So I thought I'd list down a couple of my favorites. Coming from Asia, I have tried many different types of food, and I mean A LOT. Which was why I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have raw oysters and shrimps on ice. And sashimi platter too. I remember seeing salmon, tuna, hibachi, octopus sashimi to name a few. The baby clams, crabs and lobsters are really good too. 

By now it is pretty apparent I am a huge seafood fan. But in addition, I also love their tepanyaki (stir-fry) bar. You get to choose the items you like and the chef will stir-fry them for you on the spot. On certain days you get marinated beef ribs at the bar, which are awesome. 

The popular items do go very fast, so keep an eye for your favorites and get it fast, otherwise it will take a while before they re-stock, especially on busy times of the day.
They do have a large seating area with an additional room, so definitely the place to go if you have a large group. Great for gatherings and such. 

The location is out on the East side, not the most convenient for me who lives out on the West side and work on campus. But it's great selection of food and good quality draw me here regardless so that says quite a lot about the place =)"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. Very impressed with the wide variety and the stir fry to order grill. The staff was very punctual. Was with a party of four and everyone enjoyed everything they ate. All of us will definitely return and will definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"one of the best Chinese buffets around. yes, it suffers from the same pitfalls of other buffets: sometimes you might choose something that isn't perfectly hot or fresh. this is just the \"nature of the beast\" when it comes to buffets. truth is, they are at a disadvantage to a regular restaurant. if you are at a non-buffet restaurant and are served food that is luke-warm, you have a legitimate complaint. but lets be honest, it comes with the territory at buffets, and there is no easy answer. some say they should just put out smaller amounts. well, ok, but they can't really make the replacement serving until that one is gone, so then the complaint will be that the food keeps running out. if your food is actually cold, let them know so they can do something about it. otherwise, if you expect everything you eat to perfectly fresh and hot, you really should stay away from buffets. I took that much time on that issue because I feel some people have completely unreasonable expectations at buffets. it's the same as if I went to a regular restaurant and complained that I didn't get a huge selection of food and could eat all I wanted for one low price!
now, to get specific about Journey....to be honest, I would say the quality is the same as other buffets that I have ranked highly, but where they really shine is selection. an entire row of sushi, with 2 guys right behind the buffet making it fresh. this is one area I would say the quality is above other buffets. for buffet sushi, this stuff is really, really good. fresh, lots of flavor, huge variety to choose from. they have a better than average Mongolian grill available, usually at least 4 different kinds of soup, a salad bar, nice assortment of fruits, soft serve ice cream you can put in either a cone or a bowl, pre-packaged containers of vanilla, chocolate or strawberry ice cream, the usual assortment of cakes and cookies, and even on the lunch buffet you can get fried scallops (imitation, i'm guessing, but still good), fried shrimp, salmon that was much more flavorful than usual, and the usual selection of Chinese dishes along with many choices you never see at other buffets. as I said, the selection is great at this place. i'm really surprised they can offer the lunch buffet for only $8.45. personally, I've never had anything here that was cold, tasted like it had been sitting for a while or lacked in flavor. the place is also very clean, plenty of seating available and has a much more upscale look than other buffets. and the service has always been really good as well.  if you enjoy Chinese buffets and know what to expect in terms of quality, you have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I came to the journey with few friends for lunch today. I don't usually like buffet that much, but was very glad my friends brought me here. 
They have Chinese, Japanese, American food and desserts, so it meets everyone's needs. I don't eat sushi. Well, the chef that makes sushi in front of you was very nice and introduced a few different kinds of sushi for me and they're all cooked. I really liked them, I will start to eat sushi from now.
I love the Chinese food here, all fresh and hot, hot, steamy hot. The staffs was very friendly, always bring new items out when they see you need more of it.
I will definitely bring my family back to have  dinner here, I know we will have a great time."}
{"text":"Looks good when you walk in, but that's about it. Lots of choices, but nothing is hot almost room temperature. Staff was nice..."}
{"text":"For an Asian buffet, this place is as good as it can get unless you are looking to pay $25+. I really cannot imagine how they actually turn a profit charging $9 for lunch and $13 for dinner. The selections on the buffet are varied and high quality. The meat in the chicken is white meat and very tender... the Mongolian grill is a nice plus.

They have a couple steamed bun items (egg custard and red bean paste), a few American items (fried Chicken, pizza, fries), sushi rolls-- none of which are spectacular but they are better than you'd expect at an Asian buffet. You also see them preparing and slicing the rolls so you know they have at least been made recently.

There is an extensive salad bar and fruit/dessert bar, the service is very responsive (continually filling up your drinks... although they certainly have incentive to do so, as the drinks fill you up far cheaper than the food). 

I'd go for lunch for the maximum value, although at $13 it is still a total steal for dinner as well."}
{"text":"What is expected of your typical asian buffet. I stopped by a few times in the past in which I would have rated them a 4. The sushi buffet used to be fresh and delicious. In recent years, however, the quality has vastly decreased. There is still a large variety and the prices are fairly cheap. For the cost though, you get what you expect. This buffet has others beat in variety and quantity, but exactly the same quality. They seem much more stingy with their nigiri these days which could reflect cost choices."}
{"text":"Had lunch twice, with 2 Japanese ladies we all enjoyed ourselves. Good Food, Service, for the money it costs, you cant beat it. I've ate at another Sushi and Seafood buffet, that was no better and cost more !! KANPAI !!!"}
{"text":"I found it tremendous food to choose, I can find it satisfied with my family. It is worth wealthy."}
{"text":"I went there before,they had crab on the buffet,but I saw some oysters and lobsters in picture,do they stil have those seafood?"}
{"text":"Best Asian buffet in Madison.  Variety of food to select from and they restock constantly and consistently.  I go here for the crawdads which means theres no wait to get your plateful.  They also have a lot of sushi and sashimi with chefs constantly preparing fresh rolls.  Plates are cleared quickly and service is friendly.  

I have tried all of the other Asian buffets in Madison and this place sits at number one for standards in Madison."}
{"text":"My wife and I (and our one-year old son) decided to finally try out The Journey - after driving past it a few times and hearing that the price was fantastic for the expanse of dishes and sushi.

I feel the need to preface the review by echoing what many of the other reviewers have pointed out.  This is four stars for a buffet restaurant. - judged against all the other buffets I've eaten at in Madison (a goodly number of them, my belly will attest to).  

The Great:  The prices are pretty amazing.  You get an insane selection of entrees, a hibachi chef to stir fry a custom meal (in the back of the restaurant), freshly made sushi (with the sushi chefs right behind the counter), etc...  So, to be fair - this is graded on a bit of a curve.

The Meh:  The sushi, as pointed out in other reviews, does tend to be as rice dominant as you would expect at a buffet (and with these prices).  A lot of \"krab\" used in this sushi, but a few rolls with salmon, tuna, etc... as well.  I wasn't really blown away by anything on the sushi line, but I happily ate everything on my plate.

The deserts were also standard buffet fare - nothing shocking.  I should have gone with ice cream (they have a wide assortment in a freezer, in little individual cups.  Pretty cool.)

The ??:  The speaker system in the restaurant was tuned to a Christian radio station - which was confusing on a few levels.  Namely that it wasn't what I'd consider cool ambiance for restaurant dining.  Honestly, it was weird with a beard.

The Not Good:  The women's room, I was told by my wife, was \"nasty\".  I didn't visit the men's room, so I'll assume it was as any bathroom can be - a little smelly and maybe a touch dated.

The Conclusion:  During our meal, we discussed all the restaurants which had occupied the space before them - Damon's east, The Tilted Kilt, and a few others which were gone before their names could stick.  I don't know if I'll go back to The Journey, but for their sake (and the sake of the folks who will really appreciate it), I hope they stick around.  They offer an abundance at a remarkable price."}
{"text":"This is your typical Chinese buffet. The food is the same as all the other big buffets that are out there. Obviously the food is not authentic Chinese food, but if you're hungry, this is a decent place to go. Their seafood is sometimes pretty good, and we've gotten plates of it every time we go."}
{"text":"It's huge! Twice as big as any other Chinese buffet in Madison. Lots of sushi, good selection of fresh fruit. Most of the other food is the same stuff all the other buffets serve, with a few extras. The quality was decent, though nothing blew me away with its sheer awesomeness, and right now the place is so busy that the food gets refreshed often. Service is friendly and efficient. The price is on the high side - reasonable if you're going to stuff yourself with sushi, too high if you stick to stir-fry. Kids' meals are very cheap (guess they don't eat much sushi). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our family came for dinner after a fun filled day at Wisconsin Dells. My first impression is that the place is huge! A lot of parking space, dining space, and a pretty diverse food selection. There's a noodle bar and a stir fry bar as well as a sushi bar (as the name suggests). The food was decent, but unfortunately over salted. The price was decent as well, but the one thing I did not like, compared to other buffets, is that the drinks were not included in the buffet price. 

Overall, a decent experience for a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite buffets. They have all you can eat sushi! How can I pass that up? I will admit it's not the greatest, but it is really good. The Chinese food is also really good."}
{"text":"I just don't get it. I love Journey's sushi: price is great, it's fresh, and there is a large selection.
But their hot food is not hot. The hot food chef should be fired. I can see the steam coming off some of the heating trays, but I think the food is piled so high that the food on top is cold or at the most lukewarm. 
There were only about 10 people in the restaurant. Those 10 people were never going to eat what was laid out this this evening. So, that food was definitely going to be reheated for tomorrow. I know the chef or cook wants to make enough for the supper rush. But smaller batches of food would be hotter and tastier.
Sushi restaurants come and go. If Journey would only fix their hot food problem they could be very successful. And a lot of people don't like sushi. So, your hot food has to be good and hot.
It's obvious to me that no one is tasting the food that's been set out.
And when we complained about the cold food, the cashier instantly offered us a discount. Either she's used to complaints or there's nothing she can do about it. Maybe the hot food chef is her Dad or Uncle. Who knows."}
{"text":"This second time been here some get improvement place clean staffs nice food was hot and taste a variety this is detail that why I rate 5 star every friend that I have brought here including picky eaters , really enjoyed it the first great thing you see here is there have huge sections sushi fresh salmon tuna California roll fresh raw oyster in mid west oyster seem like expensive but they had and all you can eat that amazing and lobster with scallion and ginger sauce steam lobster and steam clam mussels and the staff there was really pleasant I can definitely say that this place singlehanded blew the curve for all the other asian buffet in the area in a big way"}
{"text":"Great selection!!  Salad bar, large sushi selection (it's buffet sushi) ice cream, Mongolian grill, and probably 50 items to choose from. Always have shrimp too!!!  Very inexpensive for what you get! We go whenever we're in that area!"}
{"text":"My family and I were feeling something new today. However, trying this was a bad idea. The tables inside the building are less than a foot apart. I felt like I was eating with strangers, and it was uncomfortable. Also, it was extremely hot inside. It is hard to enjoy a meal when sweating. When I went up to get food, there was a woman at the buffet licking her fingers and then grabbing the tongs to get food. It was gross. We had to leave after not even finishing our first plate. Very uncomfortable, bad experience."}
{"text":"You can eat for only $8 and it's pretty good for buffet food. My coworkers make it a Thursday ritual to go, and we love it! The sushi selection is pretty vast for how cheap the price to eat is, tempura rolls are always fresh when we go, and the pho is decent for a cold day."}
{"text":"My family and I ate their yesterday and I tried 3 crayfish my mom had 1 and less than a few hours later I was vomiting almost to the point where I wanted to go to the hospital and my mother had sever stomach pains! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place! Wait staff was so rude! We had a party of 9, 6 adults & 3 kids who needed high chairs. They seated us at a 6 person table and a 4 person table that were separated. We asked politely if we could connect the two tables just like the group sitting behind us. The two hostess looked at us disapprovingly but didn't communicate at all and just walked away. We then decided it should be okay since the other table could do it and they didn't say anything to us. As we started to shift the two tables closer to each other the two hostess came back with silverware and one of them yelled at us! She told us that we cannot combine the tables even though we were all one group! Despite the fact that other people clearly did so as well! Then my brother asked if we could switch to the bigger tables in the next room. One of the hostess then went and checked and told us that we COULD! When we got to the other side, the other hostess came over and yelled at us again! This time she was so angry and said we could not sit there. They didn't communicate at all why we couldn't until I walked by the table and noticed that it was reserved. Which is fine, but they could have told us that to begin with instead of dragging us over there just to scream at us again!! Then they walked us back to the two tables we were originally set up with and one of the ladies grabbed a high chair and SLAMMED it on the ground!!! Unbelievable!! I was in shock at this point! I've been there before and had decent experiences. The staff has never been good but they have never been outrageously rude either!! Then after setting the chair down very harshly, she looked back at us with glaring eyes and said \"DO YOU GUYS WANT THESE TABLES OR NOT!!\" I was wanted to scream back at her and leave but the kids were tired and my brother had just gotten back from a long plane ride and it was Father's Day! So I just stared at her in shock. My brother then said calmly that it was okay and we'd take the tables without connecting them. Even then they NEVER brought us the two extra high chairs for the kids. This was the WORST service we've ever experience at any restaurant! 

ALSO aside from this horrible experience the food was not good either!! It was kind of busy but that is no excuse for shitty food and horrible service. Some of the food was cold, the crayfish which is supposed to be salty and spicy literally tasted like water! And they rushed us to get out of there! Never will I go there again!"}
{"text":"Maybe best sushi buffet in Madison. But not so good I think."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for lunch. Cannot beat the price of $8.50 for an all you can eat. Most of the popular dishes seemed fresh which was all i wanted along with some of the sushi. Desert choices were plenty along with some ice cream to top it off. Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a great deal of food for a bargain of a price."}
{"text":"They don't really do customer service here, but they are usually friendly and quick to get you seated and bring you a drink. 
The amount of food is a bit overwhelming. 
The sushi bar is rather good and you get to see them making it right in front of you so  you know it hasn't been sitting out all day. If you like typical chinese food (egg rolls, fried rice, etc.), their selection is great. If you like seafood, their selection is great. If you like chicken feet, well, they have those, too! 
You're just guaranteed to find something you really enjoy here."}
{"text":"Oh Journey... I used to love you so much! But after SERIOUS food poisonings(by serious I mean diarrhea vomiting fever oh the works!) not one, not two, but THREE times, we must part our ways. One reviewer mentioned failing health codes? Not surprised. Whatever concoction they drop on the Mango roll was rancid. The bad alcohol aftertaste means it was probably way past its expiration date and fermented (OMG!). 

Service was good which gets them one star; hot bars never made any impression. 

Unfortunately for the east siders, this is your only option for buffet. If you must go, please stay away from the mango rolls. 

DO. NOT. EAT. Le mango roll."}
{"text":"The first week they opened it was alright, now it just plain disgusting. Food taste bland and dry. Service from the waitresses were ok but service from the manager/owners were terrible. They had a coupon online and when I went to redeem it they didn't honor it and instead blamed it on their \"publishers\". I told them \"I'm pretty sure your publishers wouldn't do that unless they have permission from you guys.\" She continued to be clueless and insist to get that extra dollar from me. What upsets me was the fact that it was false advertisement to get people in and then act clueless about it. I called their \"publisher\" the next day and they told me it should be valid to use...yea, I'm never returning."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum! YUM!!! Big selection of food. Sushi bar is ginormous! Very difficult to eat modestly here."}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a very, very long time. I texted my husband afterwards that I'd just eaten at the world's worst restaurant.

LOOKS kind of like \"real\" Asian food. Beyond that it was fairly disgusting fare that should be avoided. If your well-intending relatives take you there, avoid the raw/ cold food, and head straight for the one dish of veggies (green beans). The giant steamed clams are good with the sriracha sauce on the table. 

POSITIVES
Lots of food available.
Looks convincingly like real Asian food from afar.

NEGATIVES
Carpeting disgustingly dirty and smelly

Food temperature issues: \"sushi\" and raw oysters kept for shockingly long times at temperatures that looked iffy. I would avoid anything raw here.

Mayonnaise: Chef of the restaurant covers so many food items with mayonnaise. The \"sushi\" consists mainly of fake crab mixed with mayo and then shaped into \"sushi\". Much of the other sushi is raw fish and because of how dirty things seemed, plus food temp storage questions, should be avoided. Who puts mayo and cheddar cheese on mussels and calls it \"food\"? Mayo seemed to be in awkward places. 

Icky serving equipment. The sushi bar and other places had serving equipment that had sat (with warm mayo on it) for exceedingly long times. I felt disgusted just using the equipment. 

Veggies: Where are they? There were THREE dishes that had veggies in them. This is supposedly an Asian restaurant and yet, where are the veggies? The restaurant has ONE dish that is just vegetables, the string beans. The other dishes with veggies both had meat in them, loosely identified as chicken with broccoli and beef with peppers

Tofu and brown rice: DO NOT EXIST HERE. 

Seafood: A lot of seafood was offered. Except for the big steamed clams, the vast majority of the food was overcooked to the point of being dry. Dried out lobster. Salted prawns so overcooked as to be soft and spongy. Dry \"salmon\" that somehow was the palest of pink. Dry overcooked \"steamed\" fish. I avoided the non-hot seafood because I was afraid of stomach ailments, but they also offered spicy octopus salad and jellyfish salad.

Fried Food: Virtually all other food there was deep fried. Row upon row of deep fried meat of one sort or another. 

Dumplings and other \"Asian\"-looking food: Dumplings were frozen not hand made. Any dim sum style food was sadly not what you'd expect and I suspect prepackaged as well."}
{"text":"Sushi and seafood buffet....more like sushi and Chinese food...not much seafood.  Most of the food looked like it had been sitting out for too long.  My tea looked and tasted old/stale.  I saw an employee mixing the old food with the newer food, which is not suppose to be done!  I was going to get a stir fry, but when I added green onions to my plate, I noticed dirt on them.  Not just a little, a clump of dirt!  I told a staff member and she did seem concerned at all and laughed at it with another employee.  I would not recommend this place or go back.  The place was also on the dirty side."}
{"text":"Impressed with the variety, love the sushi bar. Yum!"}
{"text":"The buffet has a variety of stations, a decent size and quality for the Madison area. You have your sushi station with sashimi that's cut against the grain *doh!*, sushi that doesn't taste fresh, and deep fried rolls that are unappealing because they've been fried and are sitting in a cool sushi trays. Even the kimchi, diakon and edamame have a mild fish taste to them.

Keep your eye out for the salad bar where they serve shucked oysters with lemon wedges.

The hot buffet trays carry your standard Chinese fare (fried rice, lo mein, Governor Tso's Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Chicken and Broccoli, etc) and your typical American dishes to appease to the Midwesterner's taste, such as mac and cheese, pizza, french fries, and egg rolls.

I actually like the soup station where they have the crowd-pleasing Hot and Sour Soup, miso soup, but they have a tapioca 'soup', which is a warm, sweet dessert soup that has a light condensed milk-like flavor.

They carry some dim sum items such as pan fried dumplings, red bean paste bao zi, shumai, and Chinese sugar donuts.

I love the Pho Station! Although there is no raw slices of beef for your piping hot Pho, there is a lovely staff there to flash cook the rice noodles for you along with a soy boiled egg, tripe, or meatball. She ladled two flavorful stock to which I topped with cilantro, lime wedges, onions, jalapenos, green onions, and basil. The basil here are chopped, I wish they would leave the leaves on the stem because there's becomes too much garnish floating around in the bowl later.

For around $13, they do not skimp on the seafood. There's cocktail shrimp, fried shrimp, breaded shrimp, (starting to sound like Bubba), stuffed crab shells, and crab legs - all of which they continually replenish.

There's also a Mongolian Grill station if you want the freshest stir-fry.

End your glutton with a soft serve cone! Swirl-it-yourself, or pick up a mini container of packaged ice cream if you are swirl-challanged ;O)"}
{"text":"Only good chinese buffet in town. But customer service is bad. All the waiter are decent and do their job but all the waitress just stand there and talk or on their phone. We're over here choking because of nothing to drink. Another time, a waitress tried to rip us off by adding a few more dollars on our bill. When she saw us calculating our bill, she came by and took it. Came back a few minutes later to give us another bill with a smaller amount. Now I wonder how many people got ripped off already by her. Some people don't even look at their check and just go pay for it. Next time, double check the bill before paying because people like them will cheat you. Might only be a few bucks, but it adds up when they cheat tons of people."}
{"text":"As good as the AYCE sushi offerings in Wausau at half the price - and you serve yourself!

I have eaten at several AYCE sushi bars, and this one is definitely in my top 3 simply just for the value. Sashimi and nigiri sushi included in the bar, and it costs $13 - not including your drink. Plus they have so much hot seafood that I wish I could eat... but being allergic to some of it, I have to stay away unfortunately :(

All of this on top of the fact that there was squid salad... the same stuff you have to pay $5-8 for a small plate of at a normal sushi bar... and it's all you can eat."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss here. Sometimes the food is super dry and really hard. It's like chewing and swallowing hay. Sheesh. I thought I was going to choke on some of the food. Maybe I went on a bad day. Sometimes this place is nice and fresh and the food is flavourful and on point. This last time though... it was just not the best. This place is good for big crowds and especially because it's a buffet joint... but just make sure you catch them on their good days. The cook near the Pho station was so rude to a customer. He didn't even want to tell her where the bathroom was. I don't know if he was being rude or just didn't understand her. She was looking for the bathroom and he just ignored her then he looked at her and shook his head \"no\". I ended up telling her where the bathrooms were and helped her myself. The restaurant itself was pretty decent and the bathrooms were not the cleanest. They seats were comfortable and the service was wonderful. Maybe I'll come around during peak hours and see if I get a different experience here."}
{"text":"This is the first buffet I have been to in a long time, and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with the food. Three stars may be slightly generous but I felt like two stars would be doing the restaurant a disservice. There were two specialty counters in the back of the food area with a prep chef; one for pho and one for Mongolian barbecue. The food I tasted seemed fresh for the most part. My favorite was the seafood surprise entree and the hot and sour soup. While I did try many other options, none are very much worth mentioning. If I'm in the mood for buffet, I'll come back; but I don't anticipate being a regular."}
{"text":"Pretty nice. Pretty nice indeed. 

I'd been wanting to check out this newer place for a while now. The last few restaurants that have operated in this space didn't last long and never seemed to be very busy. Journey, however, always seems to be hopping. This past Sunday I decided to visit for lunch when I had plenty of time to check out all they had on offer. And they had a lot. 

The sushi. They had a lot of it, probably about 12-15 different varieties of rolls. I'm a bit of a newb and a wimp when it comes to sushi, but I did really enjoy the three or four different types I tried. The pieces were being made freshly right next to the trays. With the place being busy as it was, the rolls seemed to be refreshed frequently so nothing was sitting out too long. 
The Stir Fry. I didn't try it, but it looked really good. They had all the fixing on the line. You could add whatever you wanted into your bowl, pass it off to the cook, and watch him fry it up nice and quick. 

The rest of the buffet. There was a much wider variety of dishes than I've seen at other buffets. I'd like to say I'm an adventurous eater, but on this day I was wanting the more Americanized things. The teriyaki chicken on sticks was some of the best I've had. The chicken was actually moist and not jerky like. The egg rolls, spring rolls, and sweet and sour chicken were pretty standard, but still good. Some of things I don't normally see were the full in the shell stone crabs, some crawdad looking pink things (did I mention I'm not that experienced with more out there foods?), some fish that I couldn't quite identify, and more varieties of soup than usual. 

Overall, I liked Journey. It also has the advantage of being really reasonably priced. Service was good in that things were frequently being refreshed on the buffet and my drink never got to empty. I totally admit that I am far from an expert on this type of food, but I will note that in the dining area I was seated in, there were more Asian families speaking an Asian language than there were anyone else. I'm assuming they knew Asian food and all seemed to be enjoying their time at Journey."}
{"text":"Ugh, terrible.  Rude hostess, apathetic service staff, boring, bland tasteless food.  My boyfriend (who loves sushi and octopus and oysters) and I tried a little bit of everything and were unimpressed and underwhelmed.  Little flavor in anything offered.  I'm afraid this endeavor will simply be another failure in a restaurant location that should have no problems succeeding."}
{"text":"This buffet on the east side is a god send for parents having teens with endless appetites. There is a large selection of sushi, Chinese food, American food, desserts and also have a hibachi in the back of the buffet area to personalize your meal. The food is frequently changed out and I've never encountered \"old food\" here, which is normally what I worry about in buffet settings.

The restaurant is bright, kept clean, restrooms are well stocked and maintained, and the employees are friendly. The only downside I can think of is that it is always busy, including what would be considered their \"slow time\". On weekends you'll have to be patient and wait your turn, but in my opinion it's worth it."}
{"text":"You'll be on a JOURNEY TO THE TOILET  Seriously the words \"seafood\" and \"buffet\" should not go together."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed 
It's ok if it's a lay option
Food quality is low all that grease leaves me with a tummy ache"}
{"text":"The Journey is THE best buffet in Madison. The other contender (I am looking at you \"World\") does not even come close.

For the price you pay (9$-13$) this place provides:
-sushi
-crawfish
-stone crab
-octopus
-shellfish
-mussels

All of which are of decent quality and taste.

This is a buffet - not a 5 star authentic Japanese restaurant. Out of all the buffets I have been to (around 10 across the country) this one provides the best value by far, which is what you should be looking for when you go to a buffet.

it sickens to me see people complaining that some item out of a hundred on display was not \"authentic\" enough. Get real. Authentic ethnic food does not cost $12 for all you can eat."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch, and I mostly focused on the sushi, since I heart the stuff. The sushi was better than I was anticipating, since this was my first all-I-could-eat experience and I like to keep my expectations low. Lots of rolls with crab stick and fried items, which isn't surprising since those are cheaper to put out, but also some raw salmon and other fish were on the bar.  All of the rolls tasted fresh, and there were people behind the bar putting out new rolls, so I felt pretty comfortable stuffing my face with them without fear of getting ill. Indeed, all's well that ends well. Delish.

Though it was lunchtime, my friend and I were disappointed to discover that they do not serve  wine or beer. This is basically the reason for four stars rather than five."}
{"text":"Sushi was good except for a few stale pieces..they did have a nicely rounded Buffett, American also.  We ate good and it didn't break the bank for lunch."}
{"text":"I left before I finished eating because (with the exception of the crab legs) all the food was very old and cold. I told my server but she didn't speak English.  I called after I left (feeling very sick to my stomach) and tried to speak with a manager but the person who answered the phone didn't speak English either.  This restaurant used to be very good but now is using cheaper quality and all the cooks are more interested in standing around chatting than serving hot and fresh food.  I will never come back and I promise to influence as many people as I can to stay away.  I also just read that The Journey recently failed 12 health code violations.  They are still failing in my eyes.  Never again!  Excuse me while I go vomit."}
{"text":"This buffet was okay. The location is bad. The past restaurants didn't last long but since this is a Chinese buffet it might have a chance. 

The food was not great but it was bad either. They have a sushi bar and the ones who ate sushi were pleased. 

The you can get ice cream in a cone or bowl. They also had sherbet ice cream in individual cups, and icees. 

I can see myself coming back if I don't want to drive too far."}
{"text":"Yuck! All of the sushi tasted the same. I don't know why I agreed to go here with a group of friends. This place does not know what it wants to be - Japanese, all kinds of Chinese, Thai, you name it. And they threw in some American food for those who couldn't brave the many Asian buffets. I could not resist trying the mac-and-cheese, which had a texture reminiscent of chalk dust. The entire experience was a bad journey I will not repeat."}
{"text":"I recommended this buffet for anyone who loves eating Chinese food as much as I do! :)
(09/17/14)
I believe this is the only legit Chinese buffet that's on the East side of Madison? If not let me know! Lol anyhow, I often eat here when I visit my sister and her family in Madison. The staffs are kind and simple they take us to your seats quickly and take our drink orders and we're on our way to the hot food aisles. The price is affordable and can't complain much. The food are sometimes fresh and sometimes dry (but only when it's close to closing time). I haven't had any bad experiences here yet and hoping not to. Overall it's a nice decent buffet to take your date, family, friends etc."}
{"text":"Being a Madison girl born and raised, I think this is the first successful restaurant at this location (please correct me if I'm wrong).

I like Journey, they have a wide variety of food ranging from a pho station to pizza. You'll definitely see your typical Chinese buffet dishes (General Tso, broccoli and beef, lo mein, etc.) and I do enjoy the all you can eat sushi that's included -- albeit it's not the best sushi I've ever had in my life, it's still appreciate considering the cost of some sushi restaurants. The food is pretty much the only reason why I return, when I feel like gorging on so much food that I have to waddle out (food baby) Journey isn't a bad place to pick for the price. 

The service is hit or miss, some visits I'll have a fun server (drinks and bill), I really enjoy the man that makes balloon animals and origami for guests; and other times I'll have someone who can't remember my original drink order and guesses instead of asking."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch before heading home to La Crosse. Definitely glad we stopped here since we couldn't decide what to eat. There was a great selection of sushi and also a lot  hot foods. The pho was pretty good and service was as expected like any other buffet place. We came when it opened for lunch so I'm everything was still hot and steamy."}
{"text":"5:30pm on a Saturday, the large space was bustling with activity and filling up quickly. The buffet isles were all lit up, the trays were steaming with hot food, glistening and colorful. The sushi was made in front of you, and the area was clean. 

We started with the sushi, which was surprisingly good. The pieces were small, but no fishiness -- score! My giddiness increased when I spotted steaming half crabs, but a bad ammonia taste had me later googling \"What to do when I've eaten ammonia crab.\" I had a good laugh about the responses that came up. The green beans were my favorite hot dish, fresh and stir fried with garlic and pickled radish. The mac and cheese was comforting. Unfortunately, my dining companion, a die-hard General Tso's Chicken fan who will eat GTC under almost any condition, did not enjoy their General Tso's Chicken. The salad bar was virtually untouched, and I could see why. Both trays were filled with either limp spinach leaves or browning iceberg. They also have a variety of fresh fruit and a selection of desserts. Jello and soft-serve could be found, two necessary staples of the epic suburban Asian buffet.  

If you like volume and variety, this may be the place for you. There is a lot of effort put into keeping the prices as low as they are. For example, the fried scallops weren't really scallops but some sort of imitation meat. I should have known, seafood + all-you-can-eat + we-are-not-by-the-sea probably isn't a good combination. I think the shrimps were real though. 

TL;DR: The best thing about this place is the sushi, but it's not good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife and my grandson ate here on Sunday the waiter was very nice he kept joking around with my grandson keeping him quiet and that the food was delicious I eat at a lot of Chinese buffets wherever I go cuz I like Chinese food and this place was good I recommend it to whoever is in the area of this place to try it"}
{"text":"This place is a heck of a great deal, particularly for lunch. $8.95 gets you through the door to enjoy all you can eat. For dinner, add $4.00.

They have a ton of sushi and other Asian selections, including a grab your own ingredients and have them cook it on the grill in front of your eyes. Not a fan of sushi or other Asian dishes? No problem! Pizza, french fries and other \"American\" dishes abound. 

The food quality is pretty top notch. I'm very picky about all you can eat buffets because the food is typically? low rent. Not in this case. Everything looks very fresh and tastes great.

If you're gluten free, never fear. Options abound!

Then there's the fresh fruit and desserts, along with soft serve ice cream.

I really enjoy coming here and I believe you will, too. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I tried this place at the recommendation of a friend who went here a couple of weeks ago. I'm glad I did. We came here during a day trip to Madison for my fiancée's birthday/doctor's appointment/trip to pick up a turtle we're babysitting. It made a suitable birthday meal.

The regular buffet items were probably the best I've had at any Asian buffet I've been to. Everything seemed fresh and the options I chose were outstanding compared to other buffets I've been to. My only complaint is that the fried rice was a bit bland, but it's meant to be mixed in with the other foods so that's a minor gripe.

My stomach was a little bit uneasy all day (unrelated to and preceding coming here, totally not anything to do with the restaurant) so I took it easy on the sushi. The few pieces I had were good, although they weren't, in my opinion, on the same level as the rest of the food. For sushi, I'm definitely still more partial to Fushimi/Fushinami on Milwaukee's east side. That said, the sushi is endless and you're free to take as much or as little as you like. Too often with sushi buffets you're locked into a whole maki roll only to discover its not quite your thing; here, that's not going to happen. The sushi area seemed sanitary, and two guys were making the rolls fresh as I browsed.

The service was pretty friendly for a buffet. Often, at a buffet I feel like I'm being watched by the staff; here, it felt like the staff was present but not like I was being stared down. The woman waiting on us was attentive about clearing plates and bringing drink refills.

Finally, the price: we did the lunch buffet. Honestly, for all-you-can-eat sushi...you really can't beat this price. $8.XX per person, plus a bit for the drinks. That's just unheard-of.

Easily a 4/5. I plan to come back on some future trip to Madison, and I could easily see bumping it up to a 5/5."}
{"text":"Biggest selection of chinese food and sushi (with sashimi) in town. They even have a decent pho.  Is there a larger one? Tell me about it.

   Anytime I can stuff my face with a vast variety of good food for a reasonable price deserves a four star maybe even five!"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of buffets, but Journey is better than most. There are Americanized dishes as well as some more authentic dishes. The buffet also includes some American dishes and a HUGE sushi buffet.

If you are a sushi fan, the price is well worth is for all you can eat. The sushi is above average but mostly Americanized sushi. Most of the sushi is cooked, but there are a few traditional pieces of sushi (raw fish and rice).

I was impressed with the selection of seafood and a big fan of the mussels. There's Chinese style desserts as well as Jello and soft served ice cream.

The place is usually packed with Asian peeps which usually means the food is pretty good. In this case, I think it's more of the fact you get a ton of food for very cheap.

Overall, probably the best Chinese buffet in Madison so definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I love eating at all the Chinese buffets in Madison, this one has the most sushi n hands down the poorest n rudest service I have ever experienced.  Beware of the older skinny Chinese lady!!  Would not allow my party to connect tables. N slammed the booster seat down in front of us. Like really?  Please calm down ma'am.  Go at your own risk!"}
{"text":"The better buffet restaurant around the area. Good atmosphere and good food. Will always go back. If you haven't tried it. Go for it.  No regrets. .."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the size of this buffet and the variety of food served. However, the sushi bar was a disaster. The sushi was not at all tasty or fresh. The only thing I really enjoyed at the buffet was the Pho. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This is my first time to this place. I am not a buffet person but I have heard so much of this place that I had to try it. True to its hype, I am giving my 4 stars for the shear variety they had. 

Quality of the food varied. The sushi wasn't great. I would skip that whole line if I ever come back again. The Chinese dishes were pretty good. I loved their steak. It was juicy and tender. One of the best I have had in a Chinese place for sure. The desert selection was quite minimal. They had a good variety of fruits. The ice cream machine wasn't in a great shape. I wasn't sure if it was even functional. 

Their service was good. I make sure I compliment service and rate them as important as the food. If u enjoy sea food, this place has a huge selection. If u can really eat and have a good appetite, this is worth every dollar u pay."}
{"text":"Great food for the price you're paying! This place recently opened and truly shows Madison how Asian buffets are meant to be. Like most Asian buffets, they have the classic Chinese dishes, but they also have an extensive line of sushi maki (rolls), nigiri (pieces), and sashimi. Additionally, they have a salad bar and a Mongolian type of grill bar at the back of the restaurant.
The lunch buffet is $8.45; dinner $12.95. The price includes all sushi and sashimi. Lobster is also available for dinner/Sunday's. Servers are also very responsive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a buffet person at all, but I enjoy coming in here every so often. During my first pass, I usually get one of every type of sushi in that section. What is really a treat for me is when they serve the salmon roe and one bite of it is like this big, salty explosion in your mouth. They also have some nice Chinese food as well, although they could improve in their crab rangoons. They have some nice cheese pizza. I really enjoy the crayfish and it's nice ammount of cajun spices. I'm not a big fan of the crab, but perhaps it's because I prefer mine warm. I really enjoy the fried tenticles, it's got a good flavor to it and it's not too chewy. They have a nice salad and fruit bar as well and I also like their desserts and choices of ice cream along with their soft serve ice cream machine. What's also cool is you can go into this place and buy buffet items to go, they charge you by the pound, and it's pretty cheap if you wnat to go that route. But around ten bucks for an all you can eat lunch is pretty cheap in my opinion, and during this time you get seated really quickly. The only thing that would make this place even better is if they served alcohol, but for now, they're pretty good with what they've got. All in all, it's a nice place to eat, even if you're not into sushi, they've got other selections and I think they're pretty exceptional. So kudos to you Journey!"}
{"text":"3 star for the food, 5 for the pho.  Had dinner here nearing closing time, bad choice! Food was cold and dry, duh! However, the pho was ridiculously good! Very surprising....."}
{"text":"Why is this place rated as 4 stars??? 
This is your typical Chinese buffet with a few more sushi roll choices. Food was not fresh. The quality of sushi was low. And it seemed that the food has been sitting there for a while. I know I will never be going back to this place. 
Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I just like going here for the sushi! Also the other dishes are just great too. I never had a bad trip here. 
The seating area is really nice and open. They have big table for families."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on a Tuesday morning. I wasn't sure what to expect based on reviews, but it was perfect. The interior was modern and comfortable and our waitress was kind an attentive, always refilling waters timely. I'm sure that a midweek early lunch had the benefits of fresh sushi which is what we really came for. As other reviews mentioned, there was a large assortment of items and options to choose from. We tried a few items from the Chinese bar that we didn't like, but overall the sushi and seafood were yummy it was a great experience. You can't beat the $9 lunch price tag!We don't live in the area, but when in town, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This wasn't the worst buffet I've had, but it wasn't more than okay, and the price was far too high for the quality.  The sushi, which was what I was most interested in, had that dry, chewy consistency that says, \"I'm not fresh -- you should leave me alone.\"  The other seafood was okay, but all of the dishes had the muddied flavor that suggests that more care could have been taken with, for example, cleaning the shellfish."}
{"text":"one of the better buffets I have been to went with 2 kids and 2 adults and we all found something we liked"}
{"text":"This is a place my fiancee and I like to go to, as well as have a group of friends for no-fuss dinner.

There's a good variety of foods; my favorites are the crab rangoon, fried rice or noodles, and almost any of the meats. I also like that the sushi has a cooked option because raw fish isn't my thing. We've yet to try out the hibachi grill in the back, but it may require that you not eat anything else at the buffet since it can be so filling.

Overall, this is a no-fail place for a cheap and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Reviews for this joint have been all over the map.  Most people seem to love it, but there are a couple of severe haters.  After my mental compilation of all those Yelpers, I came away with a joint that is the (former) Oysy 2.0.

Journey is everything I want from an Asian buffet; well maintained buffet and dining area, friendly & efficient service, massive variety of seafood, fresh sushi, traditional Chinese buffet favorites, a flat top grill, soft serve, Gremlin feet [  see photo for proof (or steroid-aided chickens that were seriously juicing)] and so much more. 

The 1st thing that nails your noggin in its size.  The  place is massive.  There  are so many buffet stations that it's a bit overwhelming.  You cannot take in everything at once -- if you try, you'll get an internal system error message (like I did).  

As soon as I rebooted, I noticed there were two sushi chefs preparing it fresh at the buffet.  I decided to survey the landscape because there are so many options there is NO way to get through everything.  I passed many rows of sushi, sushi appropriate salads, a fresh salad bar, Chinese bakery, cream puffs, soft serve (and ice cream cups) many rows of Chinese dishes with a variety of crab, faux scallops and some imitation crab dishes, a \"mostly\" fried American buffet area, mediocre looking pizza and a flat top grill with an attending chef.   This place is massive!  Googly moogly.

I sampled pretty much everything I could have wanted except I had no room at all for ordering a dish from the flat top grill section.  

The sushi... is very good.  There are is a great selection of of sushi.  I had about eight varieties myself including versions of uramaki, nigiri and western style.  Although the pieces were smallish, they were cut adroitly, formed well and tasty.  Of course it's not the primo quality you'll get at 1st rate sushi bars because it's an effin' cheap buffet. 

The entries and salads, for the most part, featured good ingredients, were well-prepared  and never sat too long.  At many other Asian buffets in the area, dishes like General Tso's chicken become sticky without the fried crunch that fresh versions have.  Not only did their chicken have the perfect texture, all of my pieces were white meat.  

A couple entrees and seafood items were a little under-seasoned like the lo-mein and crayfish.  No worries, folks.  Journey includes any kind of sauce you could ever want at this type buffet (at least 20, I believe) and the several I had were exactly what I use at home or prepared perfectly (e.g. the dumpling sauce). 

I was so ticked I had no room for the flat top grill station, but I couldn't trust my suddenly balloonish belly with another full plate.  Next time.

Soft serve and the mini Chinese buffet cake squares were the perfect closer to my fattening feast.  My family, a crew of devil's advocates, were all super duper happy with the meal and agreed that it is unquestionably the best buffet in the Madison area.  We will be going back once every few months.  

Service was perfect.  We were seated immediately.  The pleasant server nearly met us at our table.  She came by and stopped several times for immediate dish clearing and beverage refills without any of us even having to ask.  

I went to Oysy at least six times when it was open.  It is better than Oysy ever was in every conceivable respect and measure (including the price, strangely enough). 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with Journey except for their price points.  I have no idea how they can make money charging south of $13 for dinner.  It would be a value at $19.95 per person.

Tips:
When you are at an Asian buffet and see scallops uniformed size and batter-fried, rest assured they are not real scallops.  

Do not expect the crab to be \"real\" crab meat when it is mixed with cheese and put in a crab shell or in anything that it can be concealed.  It's a \"trick\" performed at almost every Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"This place is seriously a hit or miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes, it's not. The first time I went, it was in the morning and for some reason, the food wasn't good. The second time, it was in the evening. It wasn't bad, it actually tasted okay."}
{"text":"great selection of sushi?Chinese food and dessert for only 15 after tax?it's very much worth it. But stay away from fruit sushi?mango is not fresh at all."}
{"text":"The combination of price and quality for a seafood/sushi buffet is phenomenal.  EVERYTHING, including the other buffet dishes, were excellent."}
{"text":"Disgusting.

I don't know if we caught them on an off night (thursday @ 9pm) but very few things were even considered edible. And I do use the word \"edible\" in a loose way. Every piece of meat I tried was hard and very flavorless, EVERYTHING (no exaggeration) tasted stale, the egg rolls might of as well been filled with cardboard, crab rangoon was filled with a gross watered-down version of what I guess I'll call \"cream cheese\" and the Sriracha sauce on the table was most definitively NOT Sriracha. Everything about this place is fake and gross, but what instilled the most horror was the sushi line. Dear Lord. I could smell it before I even got close, and not in a good way.  

Very gross atmosphere, I DO NOT recommend putting anything this place has to offer in your body. It will hate you for it.

And with the total bill ringing in at $27 for just two people, this place really earned half a star in all honesty. Please do not make the same mistake I did by waking in."}
{"text":"For someone like me, and NO not because I'm chubby hehe, it's absolutely great. They have very good food and some certain foods they need to work on *cough* noodles *cough*. The food is great, sushi is pretty good (I'll get to that in a second), and the little grill is pleasant. With all that being said if you go there specially for sushi you will be disappointed. They're selection is pretty good but not amazing and they can definitely work on putting more sushi out as far as variety. Besides the sweaty gym sock tasting noodles the place is amazing. Haven't had any problems whatsoever with service either but considering it's a Buffett service really isn't a a make or break in this situation anyways. The pricing is the one factor that made me take a star away. $15 a piece including a $2.50 drink?? To that I say \"if you're going to rob me, at least rob me at gun point so I feel a little better about myself\". Seriously though it's one of those things I struggle with justifying the price. For that price it ALL better be amazing. Anyways. To each their own. I don't normally complain about pricing but the value has to be there and that's up to the person."}
{"text":"The food is good but I will say the service is really bad last time I was there. So I change the rating to 1 star. 
Waiting for beverage refill for 20 min, no luck so I brought my glass and ask another waiter to get a refill. When I was back to my table, the guy who served me said fuck off if I am not satisfied with his service!!! 

Seriously? How can you expect to hear such kind of words from a waiter in a restaurant? 
This is definitely not acceptable. They really need to spend some time and effort to train their waiters."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the food all sucks, just a typical Chinese buffet on the inside but the food is way worse"}
{"text":"Service was good, but it was like they shut everything down 90 minutes before close. The only food that wasn't cold was the sushi and when I went to have some Mongolian stir fry done, the grill was shut off? The food had ok flavor but was a bit on the bland side. I do want to make sure to mention the service again, top knot have for a china buffet!"}
{"text":"This is where we always go when we're in the mood for sushi.  You can't beat the price and variety and you can see the sushi rolls being made fresh.  In addition, they also have a Chinese buffet here."}
{"text":"Gross. Cold and old food. Also the chief dint wash his hands after using the bathroom. If I could give a 1 I would.."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Madison,flavorful food good pricing all u can eat sushi can't ask for a better deal than that"}
{"text":"As a non seafood and non sushi eater, I can at least say there are options! You can find things from Chinese (General Tsao) to American (mac n cheese) to Italian (pizza).  They also have soups, which I tried the hot and sour, which is one of my favorites, but have had better flavor-wise.  It was also warm, not hot in temperature, but that's a personal preference that my soup be on the verge of boiling. 

The atmosphere wasn't anything special, from what I have experienced for this type of buffet restaurant. We had a group of about 10 and they accommodated well.  It was actually a birthday/work meeting, so we stayed after a bit and did not feel uncomfortable hanging around.  Our server was nice overall and we all were able to get separate checks.  No struggle giving the wrong one to the wrong person, which isn't always common. 

Desserts were okay, self serve ice cream, some glazed peanuts that are on the plate in my pic and finger jell-o.  I am sure most aren't coming out bragging about finger Jell-o when they leave here, but I really enjoyed it, as I can't say the last time I had it. The clear one I am still lost on the flavor, but it wasn't flavorless."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some Sushi while I was up in Madison & found this place. Good reviews, it's a nice looking restaurant from the out side but inside it is basically the same ole looking Chinese Buffet. There was no salt on my table plus no napkins, yu need napkins at a Chinese buffet table. Slow at picking up plates, the fishy stuff smelt fishy. The half cracked crab had no meat in it. I did not understand how some of these table had very hot steaming table but not everything was hot . The sushi did not taste fresh & boy did I pay for it once I got back to my hotel room. I was going to give this place a 3 but after being on the shitter twice in less then an hour, thought I would drop it to two stars. Never again!"}
{"text":"Best sushi & Chinese buffet in Madison, WI since the passing of the OYSY restaurant. Very good selection of sushi but don't expect high end quality as you would get from dedicated sushi restaurants but definitely several notches above your local grocery made sushi. The Chinese hot dishes are very good and have a fair amount of selection to choose from along with a Mongolian grill station. The price for lunch and dinner is super reasonable if you're looking to consume lots of food. I've been happy with my dining experiences at The Journey."}
{"text":"Fresh. $15. Busy.  I usually don't think buffet and fish go together, but this place proves me wrong.  Everything is turning around quickly because it is packed.  Good sushi, great crablegs and crabs.  Loved almost everything, and will go back."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer to this restaurant. Its by far my favorite restaurant that i go to and recommend this restaurant to my friends and family but on Sunday October 1, 2017 we came there to eat with my sisters and her kids from milwaukee. She was rude from the beginning by rolling her eyes at us because we couldn't understand her english when she ask how old was the kids. She gave us shoulder sigh and almost walked away but she realized that she didn't take our order on drinks yet so she turn around back towards us to order our drinks. The whole tire time she watch us but she never came to refill our drinks. She was standing right behind me when i ask for a refill but she kept on writing out the checks instead.  My son finally said something to her and she looked at our table and walk away. She came back with nothing and decided to grab our plates instead. She try getting my plate when i was still eating it. My brother in law ask her again if he can get  a refill and she said, \"yeah, yeah, yeah.\" She finally got our refills but we was full already.  We ask for our checks and she said something about tips so we thought she put down gratitude for herself already. When we got up to leave. She stop us and demand we gave her tip because she serve a whole entired party table. We already knew we didnt even want to tip her because of her attitude, her service and body language  towards us. But than she was angry so we threw 10 dollars on the table and left. Very rude and it should be our choice to give her tip or not. If u get a female waiter with boy cut hair that is blonde than be careful. She's rude and demanding."}
{"text":"We stopped to try this buffet out to see if it was worthy.  We all decided about the same that it was just ok!  Nothing wrong with our meals at all, but nothing truly fantastic that we siad you gotta try this.  It was just a run of the mill style unhealthy buffet with way too much MSG in thier food Chinese buffet.  There was a large selection of foods to choose from though.  The employees were constantly bringing out new fresh dishes.  Everything looked hot and fresh.  They had most all of the typical Chinese dishes and then some!  This place does set itself above the rest with all of thier sushi and sashimi choices.  Most of them again were just ok.  Nothing here gives you that wow that's amazingly good reaction. The sushi at this resturant was being prepared by a Mexican man, not a Chinese or Japenese man which made me chuckle on the inside a little bit.  Not that I care who makes it or that thier race of there ethnicity has anything to do with it.  I just expected to see it done I suppose by someone else.  Place is somewhat clean, not the  friendliest staff, barely seem to speak english when we went.  Waitress was polite and very good about getting refills and clearling off the old plates from the table.  Lots of fresh fruit and sweet treats to end your meal with if you saved any room.  You will not impress anyone by bringing them here, but if you are just trying to fill your stomach its editable food during the busy times of the day.  We came here around 1pm for lunch.  There was maybe another 25 people in the place. Not bad, but not impressive!"}
{"text":"Busy place with lots of food options.  Dessert bar and salad bar were very well maintained as well as many other sushi and seafood stations.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had an A-OK experience at Journey, let me tell you about it. 

Selection. Largest selection of items at a buffet around. There are at least 6 buffet lines ranging from sushi to salad to dessert to soup. 

Sushi. Once again, largest selection of sushi at buffet I have ever seen. I am allergic to shellfish so I am limited in my selection, but, the spicy salmon rolls and the veg rolls were a favorite. The staff were knowledgeable in directing me to what I could and could not eat. They were willing to make something specific for me to accommodate my allergy. 

Something I would have wanted to see was food with a bit more kick to them. A lot of the main dishes were on the bland side."}
{"text":"You know I really wasn't sure what to expect here. My wife wanted to try it and our friends had coupons. So we decided to go. We walked in and couldn't get over how big this place is. I'm still picturing Damon's being here. 

One of the things I noticed was the fact that it was pretty busy and there were quite a few Asian families here. That's not something I normally see at most Asian buffets. 

Overall it was pretty good, sushi was fresh. My favorite was the Shark Sushi. Lots of options here. Worth a try."}
{"text":"When i am craving chinese food I am not looking for a big plate, small portion type of place. I am feeling glutinous and want some freaking general tso chicken and some hot and sour soup- and a lot of it.  This buffet delivers. 

Everything hot was legit. They even had fried chicken, pizza and \"fresh\" dinner rolls. They had hibachi style grill with a ton of ingredients. I didnt do the salad bar as I wanted to be fat.

The sushi was better than grocery store sushi but not like anything you'd find at Red or Muramoto.  Some of their doctored up rolls with a ton of sauces on them were ok but some were \"i'll never try that again.\"  My best advice is proceed with caution. and dont expect the kind of sushi that would cost a $15 roll in a different restaurant.

If you got the chinese meat sweats this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this Buffet both times I have had the pleasure of eating there. My son loves sushi and felt the stuff was good.  \"Haven't had a bad bit yet\" were his exact words. Feeling that a  good buffet will have good food but seldom great food this Buffet hits the mark and more. Coconut shrimp very good but a tad too sweet for me.  General Taos was tasty but not really spicy. Nicely cook asparagus. So many other good dishes to choose from you may forget they have a Mongolian grill. This grill is there to please the absolute pickiest eater.  And as stated by others the sweet treats are so good you may not stop eating when you know you should. I have enjoyed the vegs they have both in the salad bar and in the steam tables.  When you want a buffet with plenty of seafood this is the one to choose."}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all a year ago but in two recent trips at noon, changed my mind. I don't give five stars very much but when the food and service is good why not?   First the wait staff is friendly and efficient. Rare in Chinese buffets. All the food that I tried was very good. The wonton soup, egg rolls and potstickers were as good as anywhere. They have rice noodles, which I prefer over rice to dump whatever dish I chose for the main meal on. Chicken and broccoli  and a peppery thing I can't remember. I tried most of them that wasn't fried. The sushi I don't know about and rarely eat it but I still tried two of them and liked them both. Hugh desert section with great jello and almond cookies! Lots of other choices but I try not to pig out on sweets. I see the other reviews that are very negative but compared to the other Chinese buffets in Madison this one, on the two times I was here, left me satisfied. Try it yourself and be sure to start with the soup."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was decent for a buffet. I'm the type of person who can put down 6 rolls at a sushi buffet. If there's one thing that this place has taught me it is that you shouldn't trust raw fish in a roll averaging less than $1.50 (and that's an overestimate for how much each of these rolls cost given the cheap price of the lunch buffet). The salmon had a rubbery texture when it is supposed to be soft. However, all the rolls without raw fish (e.g., the California roll) were fine."}
{"text":"This place is great!! It's clean, very big, has a LOT of food options and a stir fry and ramen noodle station. 

The only reason they lose one star is the inconsistency of how their food tastes. Some days it tastes excellent and other days it tastes okay. I know it's like that for a lot of restaurants due to having different cooks but 5 star restaurants to me have consistent tasting meals"}
{"text":"Would give it a 4 star but the sushi was too dry. The food overall was good except for the sushi. They also have Pho. Yay!!!! The soup was good. I try the hot and sour soup and added shrimp. Tasty!"}
{"text":"What a yummy buffet for such a great deal!

Looking back, I feel like I didn't eat much but apparently I had about 2-3 plates. The sushi section was almost always empty the entire time we were there because everyone was snatching them up. It was nice to see the sushi chefs were right behind the station making more. I also really liked that the sushi was labeled (raw or not), since my boyfriend prefers the cooked sushi. No guessing game there!

I think I was most excited that they had coconut shrimp and egg custard. I could be completely satisfied just eating those two with some fried rice. The selection of food was definitely not short of satisfying anyone who has different taste. My friend ate the same thing over and over with complete satisfaction. My boyfriend spent his time walking around and eating anything he could really find. Baked mussels were one of the favorites. The one section we didn't really touch was the American food--pizza, fried stuff, etc. 

The back of the restaurant had a \"make your own stir fry\" type section which I skipped (for now) since my belly was begging me to stop. That's definitely the first place I'll be going to next time!

Being from LA and having visited Las Vegas numerous times, my buffet expectations are pretty up there. And although Journey doesn't surpass LA and Las Vegas when it comes to buffets, it's pretty close. Pretty close in proximity to my house too---just 5 minutes away!

That might be dangerous.

By the way, they're open on Thanksgiving until 8pm. FYI."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of buffets normally but this place is legit! Great food and plenty of selections."}
{"text":"Unexpected surprise, a decent seafood buffet in Madison, good service and attentive staff. The ambience was to be expected, family oriented. The surprise was they have decent sushi! If your ever in middle America give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is MASSIVE! 

Large selection of everything, Including sushi! i tried a few different things and they were all pretty good. the starting role here in my opinion is the noodles that you can have made, go do that first! they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Everything here has been okay but nothing is really outstanding.  The service is standard for a buffet and there are lots of food options as other have said.  The sushi itself has been disappointing, almost squished together like it was prepped days prior.  The freshest food is going to be the made-to-order stir-fry style dishes.  

Honestly the price kind of gets me here, especially if you are new to the buffet and don't really get into it (perhaps that's what the mac & cheese and French fries are for)  -- you're still on the hook for $13-16 per person.  I'd hope kids are less.  I don't know what could add more value honestly, maybe include a drink with the buffet price?  They used to have $2 off coupons but they disappeared."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting Journey's to be an Asian buffet from the looks of its exterior. This establishment has plenty of parking and it's simple to find: it's in front of a Target in Madison East Side.

We were greeted with smiles as we walked in. We had a group of 7 adults and 3 children on a Sunday - adult pricing is $12.95 per person (unsure what the cost is per child). They were able to find us seating; no problem because there were plenty of seating - and I mean PLENTY of seating. 

The sushi bar manned the front with 3-4 standing chefs prepping the trays of sushi. A variety of perhaps 6 (give or take) different rolls were available with sides like seaweed salad and edaname. There were a large variety of other foods - whole crabs, bbq ribs, chicken wings, pizza, fries, broiled fish, stir-fries - there was even a hibachi bar! There was an area dedicated to desserts - my favorite was the ice cream selection. 

Service is friendly. They cleared our empty plates as soon as we got up to go get another plate. They also refilled our drinks regularly. We must have stayed there over an hour just talking and eating - there were no push from the waitress that we had to hurry up and eat.  As good as it gets as far as Asian Buffets goes - based on the price and selection that you pay for."}
{"text":"I'm done with these sushi buffets! I couldn't find a decent tasting, non-greasy dish. Other than the blah, hope I don't get sick from it sushi. I'm from out of town and know what good asian and sushi is supposed to taste like. I wouldn't give that food to my dog."}
{"text":"We stopped here after seeing a sign & reading some reviews on google. The sushi selection for a Chinese buffet was awesome I didn't expect it to be that big. That was about the highlight of the buffet (well that & the custard buns!) 

The rest of the food was average even for Chinese buffet standards. The sea food really had 0 flavor & I was extremely disappointed in the crayfish which I expected to have a little spice to. 

The make your own Pho was pretty awesome but maybe it's me but the broth tasted cinnamony & it was over powering. Though the eggs were awesome should of gotten a bowl of just them. 

Also while walking around a girl ran to the man next to me to tell him someone barfed in the bathroom & they sat on it which I have to admit not their fault soured it a little for me."}
{"text":"Journey really only deserves one star, and the only reason why I am giving it two stars is because there is a waiter who makes origami, periodically drops it off, and sometimes brings little toys for the kids. He is always amazing.

This place is a complete hit or miss with service and food. 

The food is sometimes too bland and soggy from sitting out too long. As for their sushi selection... I mean it s buffet so... yeah

We recently had a party of 14 (7adults and 7kids ages 10yrs-1mos) and tried to squeeze into a long table in the back. We overfilled into the booth and one of the waitress completely flipped out; even though there were several other booths open. She then started to yell at another waitress across the room who eventually came over. Once the other waitress was over they insisted that we all squeeze at the table, where we were already sitting elbow to elbow. They told us that because they were expecting to \"get busy\" we could not sit at the booth. After going back and forth, they eventually allowed us to sit at the booth. It was completely unnecessary and there was no need for the waitresses to be as rude as they were to us. To top it off, after our bill was dropped off, our waitress literally was hovering over us to pay. At the end, we never got an apology and left so disappointed. We definitely won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with a colleague.

Absolutely fantastic!  This place has everything!!

Great sushi, awesome food across the board and at a great price.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Probably best sushi in town for a Chinese buffet type restaurant.  Best time to come is during lunch or dinner rush to get the freshest sushi.  Lots of other options to choose from other than sushi as well."}
{"text":"BEST asian buffet in town! Journeys has the most variety of asian food to choose from.  The sushi is delicious and totally worth the buffet price compared to other sushi places.  I am also in love with the kimchi!  So yummy!  One awesome thing that they've recently added is Vietnamese pho!  The only small suggestion I would give is that I wish they provided lime instead of lemon for the pho.  Otherwise, I could eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"For a buffet they have a sushi line which is pretty decent!  Place is busy but keeps up with the lunch hour rush. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"If you don't eat sushi, seafood, or anything that once had a face, or dairy then Journey has only a few things to offer.  But I went here anyway because I like a challenge!  I brought with me a crabby dining companion (no pun intended) and a self-proclaimed adventurous minor.    

I walked around multiple buffet tables with minor, until I happened upon the chicken feet, I giggled with evil delight when I directed minor's attention to the feet.  Said minor took one look and ran away.  So much for adventurous.  Later I spied a tray of baby octopus, and I couldn't resist.  I again showed minor, but this time it back fired on me when she took one look and yelled \"OMG GROSS!\"  The young man preparing sushi behind the table looked at us concerned.  \"Don't mind us, we are dorks\" I assured him.  

Minor did try crawfish for the fish time, but was afraid of the little claws.  So when she was flipping it around, trying to figure out how to eat it, a claw touched her hand and a scream around the world was heard.  I also heard the phrase \"its eyes keep looking at me!\"  Ahhhhhhhh!

My crabby dining companion took one bite of fried rice, and had this look on his face like I just insulted his mama.  Turns out all the Americanized Chinese foods were particularly bland.  I tried some of the Lo mein, and yes, it definitely could have used a ton more spice.  

We paid 47 dollars for 3 people, and I have to say I find that spendy for what we actually consumed.  But I also consider it our own fault because we went here knowing what it was and knowing that we are annoyingly particular.  

But I guess lots of people really like this place because it was PACKED."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant,  the food is fresh and very flavorful. Good selection of seafood. If you like shrimp this is your place. A lot of squid and clams.  There is also American cuisine. All you can eat!"}
{"text":"It is my goal to stop by Journey's every time I'm in Madison. Being from Chicago and having access to so many Buffets, I can honestly say no Buffet that cost less than $15 can even come close to topping Journeys. 

Lunch - $9 
Dinner - $14

Their Sushi is average to above average considering the price you pay. There is a Sushi Bar in the front of the Buffet with a variety of rolls. Rolls such as California Rolls, Alaskan Rolls, Nigiri, Toro, and Amaebi. It isn't the most fresh sushi, but you get what you pay for. I'm always content. 

The best thing about Journey's is their small Sashimi selection during dinner time, $14 and you can have all you can eat Sashimi for dinner. 

Along with Sushi Journey's does offer a Chinese Styled Buffet. There are many Chinese chicken and beef dishes along with crab rangoon, french fries, fried chicken, and plenty more. There is also a mongollian grill in the back of the Buffet, at this grill you can basically design your own dish and have the Chef fire it up in the back.

In all, you will gain a few pounds when dining at Journey's. 

Cheap 
Food is great 
Good Sushi"}
{"text":"This is the only buffet I've ever been to that I've had to wait in line. That's gotta count for something lol. 

This place was pretty amazing when it first opened but it's clear that the quality has dropped drastically since then. The food's what you would expect from any other Chinese buffet. Edible and filling in the moment. Another benefit that Journey's offers is that they have a decent variety of sushi. Of course I've had much better at places, like Takumi's down the street, but for Journey's price and selection?  It's not great but it's not awful either. I'm sure i'll come back to this place. It's a buffet and its definitely doing its job."}
{"text":"Worst. Sushi. Ever. It was dry and mushy at the same time - how was that even possible? I'm not sure. But I do know I feel sick to my stomach after eating this garbage trash salt bomb food. Yuck!"}
{"text":"So, if I have to be at a Chinese buffet. Journey is my choice.

I can't lie, I was really impressed when they first opened.  It's HUGE and the sushi selection is amazing, albeit still buffet sushi.

The rest of the food is basically the standard Chinese buffet fare.  Fried and Americanized for our tastes.  My recommendation is to stay away from that and instead get fresh grilled food from the Mongolian bar and a plate of sushi.  Desserts are also pretty standard and probably not worth the calories.

Because hubby isn't a fan of Chinese buffets in general I'm not regularly eating in but rather occasionally stopping there for lunch and do sushi carry-out.  They charge by the pound to do carry-out.  The sushi costs more than the standard buffet food.  I find I can get enough sushi to satisfy my hunger and still pay less than the all you can eat lunch price.

In the end, choose Journey as it is the most palatable of the Chinese buffets in the area.  And if you don't care for Chinese food, it will still work for you with their other options."}
{"text":"I am rating this four stars--keeping in mind that it IS a buffet. If it were a typical  restaurant, it would really only get three. Lets be real, there is a different standard here.

My sister likes non-raw sushi and Chinese buffets, so this was a great place to take her for her birthday. She was quite happy with the meal. I was satisfied--especially given the price.

There were maybe 15 types of rolls out, but a third were filled with \"Krab\". Not my fave, but she said they were pretty good. Several of the others just had too much goop and just didn't make me want to put it on my plate. The one roll that stood out was the Mango roll--very tasty. The fish was pretty fresh, but many of the rolls were just kind of sloppy, with the over saucing and loose rolling. Even with all of that, it was surprisingly good for less than $15 a person, AYCE. 

My sister was excited about the crawfish, but after reading another review I told her not to get too pumped because she used to live in Louisiana. She actually said they were better than some of the Cajun restaurants she's been to in the area--but could use a bit more kick.

The other buffet items were 80% hit and 20% miss. Most things were fresh and had good flavor(seaweed salad, green beans, chicken skewers). Some were disappointing to see(baked Krab salad with cheese, crab shells stuffed with Krab and cheese, mussels covered in...cheese) and some that were just downright awful(ugh, the cakes!). 

Service was very efficient and friendly, though. 

If I had to choose to eat at a buffet in Madison, this would probably be it."}
{"text":"Don't know what to say. Thought it'd be one of those family bonding buffet dinners but it ended with everyone constipated afterwards and the following morning. Service was very slow and to health standards, the food was horrible. Everything was average tasting or plain at best. To make matters worst, the foods were not changed one bit during the almost 2 hours that we were there. The sushi rice was hard and tasted horrible. Had to tell my folks to stop eating it. The noodles were super dry with no sauce, the sashimi on the rice was discolored, and the place was dirty with no one seeming to want to work. There was one server that was only nice and really engaged my family. Thanks to that server that my review is even 2 stars."}
{"text":"Just went here after reading the review in 77 Square. It was terrific. They have delicious spring rolls, a nice selection of Chinese fare, and classic American (Mac and cheese). Very good value. Great service. Loved the prepared-on-the-spot stir fry along with cucumber rolls."}
{"text":"I was very drawn to this place due to my insatiable hunger for seafood, but it ended up being my downfall. Everything about this place is typical except for the atmosphere and the selection. The place is a LOT nicer looking and feeling than any other Chinese buffet I've been to. The selection is seriously crazy. They have all the normal stuff, plus a huge selection sushi, a large variety of seafood, a few American dishes, and some authentic Chinese dishes. Unfortunately, I hated almost all of it. The Chinese buns with red bean paste were delicious though. I tried everything, but ended up filling up on those. The sushi was dry and a little bland. A few of the specialty roles weren't bad. I tried the chicken feet, that was a really interesting experience that I will not be repeating. Everything was pretty average and ok until I sampled the seafood. I almost immediately felt nauseous. Pretty sure I got food poisoning from something. Of course none of my friends had any of it so they all keep trying to get me to go back. Just the thought of it makes me queasy. I begrudgingly went back once and ate nothing but the red bean buns and potstickers. I hope to never come back here again."}
{"text":"Decent buffet. Cheap buffet prices and came with a large group on a Sunday. There was no lobster the day we came but they had other seafood items (crab and crawfish). There were a ton of buffet items that were constantly refilled and they looked pretty fresh since the place was so busy. They had a hibachi, sushi station, and pho station which was impressive. I never expect high quality, delicate food during buffet outings and so based on this idea, this buffet met my expectations. They had excellent service and always cleared our plates quickly. Would definitely come back if I'm on the area!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Asian buffet I've ever eaten at. 

Very confused because most people eating here are Asian, normally a good sign. And everyone is piling their plates high. But I am not a picky eater and I didn't find one thing that tasted good to me. I love sushi and the sushi here should not be allowed to be called sushi. I am not a fan of seafood like shellfish so there's was a lot I had no interest in on the buffet. But I tried every type of traditional Chinese food dish they had and couldn't take more than a bite of anything. 

Lots of dishes looked good but just tasted awful. And many that were supposed to be hot were downright cold."}
{"text":"I really like the food BUT I REALLY HATE the waitstaff staring at me!  Every time I go they are staring at me! it's creepy.  I finally just had to stop going"}
{"text":"Some of the food was pretty good, and I would recommend those items.  However, some of the food tasted bad, like it was old and possibly spoiled. We didn't try the sushi.  I have always worried about the health of raw seafood.  After tasting some of their hot dishes (crab, lobster, squid, and shrimp) that tasted like there was something wrong with them, I am glad we didn't try any sushi.

What was good was the fried chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  I didn't have dessert, but the 3 in our party who did said the cream puffs tasted like the cream was plastic and the puffs were stale.  The cakes tasted old.  The hot tea I had tasted like water.  It was colored, but there was no flavor.

It was a nice place to talk, however.  Although the place is fairly large and it was full, it did not seem noisy at all and we could hear one another well.  While I enjoyed the company, the food will keep me from returning."}
{"text":"Decently good place with decent prices. I especially enjoyed the fact that they had salmon roe here as well, which was a big surprise. The seafood is yummy and their noodle station is quite good. I would come back if I was ever in the area, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I was pumped to finally try Journey - I'd seen a lot of good reviews from people I know and my boyfriend is a fan. Plus, with a coupon the lunch buffet sounded like a reasonable price. Maybe I set my hopes too high for a buffet, but I was underwhelmed. 

First, there was a general lack of things I'd expect to find (such as Chinese takeout standards like sesame chicken or General Tso's) - instead there was a very sweet, coconutty chicken. Not bad, but I could only eat a couple of pieces because it was so overwhelmingly sweet. Items were not well-labeled in terms of what was vegetarian and not. I tried a spring roll that ended up having pork in it. The sushi bar only had one veggie option and it comprised cucumber and a little bit of maybe bean curd? Some flat, brown substance. It wasn't bad, but the two pieces I had were enough. I know I'm in the minority wanting veggie sushi but a little variety (sweet potato, avocado, asparagus, etc.) would have been appreciated. Cucumber is just so cheap and seems like a cop-out. 

The buffet is obviously self-serve, but we did have a server for our drinks. My BF and I ended up switching sides of the booth after ordering our sodas (root beer for me, Pepsi for him) and heading to the buffet because I had been facing a window and the glare was bothering me. When my boyfriend ordered a refill he was brought a root beer. He later requested a Pepsi by name and was brought...another root beer. The server was unable to keep track of who ordered what and ignored his verbal request, sticking to which drink had been placed at what seat, regardless of the fact we switched. So bizarre. 

I would give Journey another chance for lunch; the price is low and I think if I went in when planning to go (we stopped in on a whim after a Target run) I'd be hungrier and more open to sampling a wider range. I feel bad wasting food so I try to take only a bite or two of things I'm unsure of, but when you do that with a whole plate you can fill up fast on things that you didn't enjoy. Time to be more strategic!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for volume, this may be your sort of place. But can't figure out why the place was so busy. Journey smells slightly fishy and is unkempt. It's the sort of buffet where you walk around trying to figure out what you are willing to eat. 

Even the American style salad bar was iffy. Only two dressings to choose from, Ranch and low cal French. On the plus was there was a choice between iceberg and spinach - but both were past their prime. 

As for the seafood - none of it passed my freshness test by smell - but folks certainly were gobbling up the low quality sushi and oysters.  Everything I sampled had a preprepared highly processed bite and aftertaste to it. 

In short - poor quality food, not much choice or variety for a buffet, so so service and not very clean."}
{"text":"We were here once, and plan on going back.  It was a while ago, perhaps 6 months, but I can tell you that everything was very good.   Many of the 'standard' Chinese Buffet menu items were much better than most Chinese restaurants.   The sushi was good.   I have had worse sushi in so-called sushi restaurants that were not buffet style.   I would say that The Journey's sushi is the best buffet sushi that I have had in Wisconsin, and one of the better sushi places, period.

Prices are reasonable, I had no complaints.  It was exactly what I was looking for in a buffet...fresh, immediate, quick, tasty, affordable."}
{"text":"It's like they took 3 awesome food groups that need to be served fresh and turned them all into buffets that sit out until they taste like death. Blech!

The sushi: first off nigiri should NEVER sit out! The temperature and texture of the fish and rice is imperative for good sushi. The sushi chefs (if you can even call them that because I'm sure they can't get certified serving like that) were working away to keep up yet most things just sat on the table getting hard and unappealing. None of the maki rolls had good flavor and I'm honestly surprised I didn't get sick.

The Chinese: once again a bunch of food, most that is deep fried, just sitting getting hard or soggy depending on what it's not supposed to be. The cat fish was impossible to serve as it was huge fillets filled with bones, the chicken and broccoli was dreadful, and the sweet and sour chicken had lost any sense of what it was. Not to mention the bus boys that come around take any food that's fallen on the counter and PUT IT RIGHT BACK IN THE DISH!! Gross!! How is that at all sanitary?? 

After all of that I didn't bother trying the Mongolian. The selection looked sad and I didn't want to wait for it.

Side note: too many items still had eyes for my liking as well.... O.o 

Even the fortune cookies at the end lacked flavor and tasted stale. I will not be back and I don't recommend giving it a try"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not eat here. It's just not good. The person who showed us our table didn't even speak to us.  Carelessness pretty much sums up the approach here: Cleaned bowls for the buffet line are tossed in a bin next to the line.  There's an ice cream dispenser (which is funny) with a messy bottle of Hershey syrup next to it.  
The food isn't good.  Except for the pho.  Just don't do it."}
{"text":"Go here for a kids birthday party Maybe, but that's the best I can recommend. This place is loud, the food is not changed as much as you would like. The flavors are just kind of mediocre. It is cheaper, and the kids love it. Go here for a cheap night out with a large group."}
{"text":"As with all buffets, Journey is more about quantity than quality. I have to say that the quality here is better than with most buffets. 

Hot bar: They do have a lot of seafood. There's crawfish, stone crab, shrimp (fried and steamed), baked salmon, clams, mussels, and SUSHI. (More on the sushi in a second). The crawfish will make you sad if you've ever had crawfish boil down South, but if not, then you should be fine. The clams are where it's at, IMO. The other stuff was probably boiled and doesn't have a lot of flavor. There's also the usual Chinese buffet items: broccoli chicken/beef, orange chicken, fried rice, lo mein, coconut shrimp, fried scallop (not real scallop! Skip it.), hot and sour soup, etc. The potstickers were a hit for me, but the other items were just ok.

Cold bar: your typical salad bar. There was iceberg mix and spinach leaves, then a bunch of typical salad toppings.

Dessert: I saw that they had individual servings of ice cream, as well as soft serve, jello, typical buffet cake, and bananas with some kind of red sauce.

Sushi bar: Sushi chefs are right behind the sushi buffet making the rolls so it's pretty fresh. As far as rolls go, most of them are ones with \"fancy\" names filled with cooked ingredients catered towards Americans and covered with sauces. They do have a couple of rolls with raw fish and some nigiri down at the end of the line, if you're lucky. I haven't had any disastrous journeys to the bathroom, so I think it's safe.

Hibachi station: Did not get to try, but they had a decent selection of raw ingredients you could pile in a bowl, hand to a chef, and have it stir-fried for you.

Service: It was packed at 6pm on a Saturday night, but we were seated in about 15 minutes. The waiters are very efficient and are pretty good about filling your water up.

Overall: There's enough variety here that you would probably have to make two trips to try everything they have. Although they have some hits, there are also a lot of misses in terms of dishes. Use your best judgement. For $12.95, you can't do better than this all-you-can-eat buffet."}
{"text":"This is a buffet. I know you aren't looking for a newspaper column critique, so here's the long story short.

Atmosphere: Slightly dirty but not off-putting dirty
Service: Quick, efficient, not warm and friendly but not rude
Prices: OK to maybe a dollar or two too pricey for some
Variety: Above average for Madison
Taste: Slightly below average for buffets for about half their offerings, average for the other half
Trend: Slowly but noticeably getting worse since first coming here a couple years ago but still good enough for right now
Self-loathing level after eating: 50% indifference, 35% glad, 10% regret for not going to an Indian buffet instead, 5% unable to process because your brain is fighting off a food coma"}
{"text":"Not very good. Many of the food items had sat on steam tables WAY too long. The crab was horrible. The fried chicken was tasteless. French fries, way undercooked. Green beans undercooked and cold. Unpeeled kiwi fruit.
The place was quite clean, The staff friendly and helpful.
Anyplace that serves General Tsao chicken and crab Rangoon is not at all authentic."}
{"text":"This would be a 4 or even 5 star review if I was rating solely within a \"cheap sushi\" category.  Really wide selection of rolls, and huge selection of other items like seaweed salad, kimchi (not very spicy), Americanized Chinese staples, dim sum, and even some 100% \"please-your-grandma style\" American food.  No one was getting anything from the salad bar or the fruits so those secitions looked a little neglected (the rest was being constantly refreshed).

You could take a group with divergent / anti-sushi tastes and they should be fine.  At $8.95 for lunch (weekdays) and even cheaper for kids it's a bargain (they get you on the sodas, though!)  Took my 11 year old and his friend who need to learn to pace themselves when it comes to AYCE sushi (just glad they did not loose it in the car on the way home after inhaling 2 plates waaay to fast...)  My 6 year old had a slice of pizza, some bread, a couple of chicken nuggets, and chocolate ice cream (and loved it)."}
{"text":"$15 lunch seafood and Asian buffet on a Sunday!

I absolutely love this place! It's cheap, endless, and... Most importantly, it's the best Japanese sushi and seafood I've had in Madison this far! REAL sushi and sashimi! Also, there's lobster, shrimp, and oysters on the shell! Way better than those overpriced Asian restaurants that leave you spending at least $40 by the end of your 1-2 person meal.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Came once a week.  Great selection.  Last time i came the toilet in the men's room was overflowing and i had to step in sewage to go to the bathroom.  Today, the AC unit in the front door leaked water on my head as I walked in.  I stood at the Pho counter for 5 minutes with waitress coming and going and no one served me.  Prices going up, quality and service going down.  Is it that hard to not have some sewage or liquid get all over your customers?"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Came here once and the prices are very reasonable and the food is amazing! Huge variety of food, Chinese, seafood, sushi, American food. It was delicious. It is high quality food for a buffet and I highly recommend to come here!!"}
{"text":"I just do no understand what people see in this place. The Fried Rice is possibly the most bland rice I've ever tried. Crab Ragoons are barely filled, Spring Rolls are extremely greasy, far too many American options to be a \"Chinese\" restaurant (  such as mac n cheese, hot dogs, french fries that were super soggy), orange chicken has a bad after taste and the desert ( minus the Almond Cookies) aren't great. I am not a fan of sushi so I cannot speak much to that.

I went here under several great reviews from people I know. Tried the food twice and have not changed my opinion of the food. It is just below average. 

Now that Orient House has changed management and have declined in quality of food, I am not sure where to go for great chinese food in Madison anymore. Journey reminds me a lot of China One which I do not like.  

Madison can produce far much chinese food. This is just bad."}
{"text":"This is a very hard place to review because the food is really good, but I can only give it 3 stars. I have been here countless times when I was looking to curb my Asian Food cravings, and it does a superb job at that. It does so well and I eat so much, in fact, that I tell myself I won't eat Chinese food ever again. There is so many choices that can fit any persons favorites. If I would rate this place after my first or 2nd plate, I would definitely give it a 4 star. The only complaint is that the dessert bar is severely lacking due to the fact that Americans like their desserts much sweeter, and this restaurant seems to shift their palate to a more oriental demographic."}
{"text":"the good sushi stir fry service the bad the entree on the buffet lukewarm some were flavorless the good does outwiegh the bad good for lunch"}
{"text":"Last night was the second time I've been to Journey Buffet.  What really impressed me was their customer service.  We were a group of 7 adults with 4 children and the staff were very accomodating and quick to bring out the high chairs.  It felt good to be treated well as a customer.  The food was also good and much better than most chinese buffets in Madison.  I would go back with a big group of friends."}
{"text":"Good for Madison. Actually, considering other options I must say its not shabby at all...
Lots of sushi options, various rolls both raw and non-raw. 
Pretty decent.
Chinese food buffet and American options as well. But I never am pleased with the American options... I suppose if you are at Journey, a Chinese buffet, don't expect the best Mac and cheese.

The crab rangoons are delish, they have soup options as well as a grill option. 

They have a self serve ice cream dessert area with other cakes/fruits/pastries.

The price is really cheap considering the options. The taste and quality also is at par with the cost you're paying."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I ate here once with a work colleague and put it this way within 45mins from being back in the office we both had the full journey end to end. Food tastes ok but instant food poisoning didn't sit to well with me. I have no idea how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Back in the day when I used to breakdance 24/ 7 and take advantage of all the free food provided by student organization events, my homies and I would perform on State Street during Badger football games to make some side money. Once we got enough bills from drunk fans that began their Saturdays with downing 40s at 8 am, we'd blow it all on eating at the buffet in the afternoon. (Because that's what you do when you're beautifully young, constantly hungry, and unaware of this tool called Yelp.) We used to hit up this spot called Taste of Asia on the reg, and even battled with that name in Columbus, Ohio in 2005. Needless to say, buffets have a small place in my heart.

But now I'm grown, I gots some $money, and I haven't been to a buffet since 2010; however, every time I get together with my old friends, I get sort of nostalgic. 

Several months ago, I took a trip out to Madison with my girlfriend and met up with one of my best buds, his wife, and their newborn. He told me about Journey's, and we decided to check the joint out. Would it be like old times?

In comparison to other buffets in Madison, this eatery is much cleaner and larger. And speaking of larger, this buffet looks like if Noah's Ark crashed and everything died inside. Whether it's scarfing down deep-fried prawns, indulging in the sushi and salad stations, or raising glucose levels to a dangerous height with the soft serve ice cream machine, one can live this fantasy at Journey's.

Sadly, all the items there, to me, just taste incredibly bland. It was the first time in while where I actually didn't enjoy eating my food. However, there's only so much one can critique about Journey's since 1) it's a buffet and 2) you're paying less than $20 per person. 

I'm sure buffet lovers will love this place. For me, though, I've moved on and so has my stomach. Thus, I think it's appropriate to give this place a well-deserving A-OK."}
{"text":"I don't know if you had the privilege to try Oysy (sushi and seafood buffet) when it was around, but this is the next best thing and I'll take it. A Chinese, Japanese and 
American buffet at a more affordable price than most other buffets in town. 

You can create your own stir-fry, no need to worry about what sauce to make (they have a sauce they use and it complements whatever you put together). There's also a ton of sushi you can choose from. Their sushi is pretty good for buffet setting, they're better than sushi you'd find at other Chinese buffets but no where near sushi special restaurants (of course). There's a salad bar with more options than you normally see, spicy mussels, seaweed salad, squid salad, kim chee and much more. The list really goes on. 

They claim they have over 200 items at the bar...I guess I need to make frequent trips and get eating, I mean counting.

{"text":"First visit. I'm allergic to seafood so I was apprehensiveand deleted trying. My loss. HUGE variety! One of the finest for lovers of Chinese food as well as sushi and seafood.

The waiter gave me 4 orogami animals and was very professional. Very clean restaurant and LOTS of seating"}
{"text":"Of the times I visit Madison, Journey's is often one of the places our group of friends finishes off with before we part ways. In a way, you can say that the journey of going to and experiencing Madison is incomplete without visiting Journey. 

Journey has a standard assortment of Chinese Americanised buffet food. The selection is large and plentiful with a focus towards seafood items. There is a section with more deep fried and American dishes that will satisfy your buffet needs. What sets Journey apart from other Chinese buffets is it's dedicated sushi bar with many Japanese American highlights. There is a large assortment of available Maki roll pieces, most made with imitation crab meat or vegetable based for those who shy away from raw fishes. They do have some tempura (Japanese deep fried) rolls and sushi and sashimi pieces as well, though the latter two take a while to restock.

If you're expecting fresh and quality sushi, you won't find it here. The rolls often feel like they've been sitting out for a while and are more chewy than you would normally find among Maki rolls. Maybe this is an indicator of how long the toppings have had to bond with the rolls? The pieces itself weren't abysmal, but weren't giving me any wow. I was left doubly unimpressed by what the sushi bar claimed to be a \"Shrimp Tempura Roll\" with me being unable to identify the tempura and an absent crunch. Anything tempura or deep fried at the sushi bar is soggy and chewy. The sashimi cuts are as slices as much as someone peeled off fish with a rough knife. The cuts are not similar in size and look very unappetizing, like they were scraped off rather than cut. The rice to fish ratio in the nigiri is often unbalanced and inconsistent as well. Overall, if you have sushi cravings but aren't raving about quality and just the experience, Journey's would be perfect. If you're expecting quality sushi for a cheap price, I'd consider traveling elsewhere. 
Besides the standard Chinese/American fusion selection and sushi bar, the service was fairly well. Plates and drinks were handled frequently and swiftly among the party of 24+ I traveled in. There's also a Pho (popular Vietnamese Noodle soup) bar but I hadn't tried it personally. The ice cream and fruit selection are also standard. 

As a Chinese American buffet, Journey's is a great place to eat for a relatively wallet friendly place. However, as it advertises itself as a Sushi buffet, it largely felt underwhelming. Definitely try this place out, but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"I came here just to check this place out even though I'm not a super huge buffet fan.

There was a variety of sushi options as well as Chinese food options. The chicken Chinese options were a bit dry but otherwise, it was halfway decent. 

The service was pretty good - the servers were pretty attentive. 

I will be back if I'm in a pinch for a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"What a great place. Total for two people for dinner was 31.44 with two sodas. I got filled up on sushi and went for some fresh fruit for dessert. The buffet is huge, almost overwhelming with the amount of choices, you will definitely find something delicious to eat. Comfortable setting, good music, clean, the staff was very responsive and friendly. My girlfriend and I will definitely be back for more!! *posted a picture of my dinner* :)"}
{"text":"The hot serving trays were hot and the cold serving trays were cold.  Most of the Sushi I tried was great. The Pho was a unique opportunity for this type of restaurant. I even liked the kimchi... it was the first time I've had it in about 10 years. Everything was nicely seasoned. Decent service for as busy as they were."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I actually liked the place...it was inexpensive and seemed to be a good quality spot (Chinese/Japanese/American hybrid) with a couple of opening service kinks to work out. Sadly, the service has improved, yet the quality of cuisine has suffered immensely, & the price-tag has gone up.

The sushi is plentiful and options abundant, however most traditional rolls call for about 1/3 cup of rice per whole roll...their rolls have WAY too much rice (at least 2x normal roll amount) so much that any flavor is overpowered by rice....perhaps they switched  chefs but my most recent visit was ridiculous...if you want to do sushi here I recommend going on the busy, weekend day/nights but definitely not during the week...the only time I recall their sushi being of good caliber was during this time frame..

The hot food is usually stale, underdone, and generally lacking...when crab ran goons are inedible I definitely raise an eyebrow! They do have consistently good items like an assortment of soup, fresh fruit, salad, and a create-your-own grill and my personal go to's like seaweed salad and surprisingly delicious mussels!

For weekends this place gets 3 stars...otherwise...more like 2 simply because service here is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Everything smelled like fish and was room temperature. The interior also has an odd perfumey smell, probably trying to cover up the fish. I have no idea why anyone would choose to eat this food:"}
{"text":"Umm. Yeah. Not super delicious. Everything was basically approaching average tasting. It's a lot of food and filled my belly. Nothing was disgusting per se, but everything was basically a little colder than lukewarm. It's deceiving because you can see steam coming out of the trays and I would even dig deeper to get the \"fresh\" stuff and not the stuff exposed to air, but still not even warm. Even the sushi was just... there. 

If you just want variety, this is the place to go. Just wish it all tasted better."}
{"text":"Huge variety! Love that they also have a pho and hibachi bar. Sushi quality is not bad for buffet. Although I have to say this place overall seems a bit filthier than when it first opened, especially the floor."}
{"text":"You typical Chinese/Sushi buffet. The food was fresh and plentiful. If you're a seafood lover the selection is great!! Accommodates large parties or just one. Staff were friendly and cleared the table rather quickly which I appreciate. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I had high hopes for this place.  Went here for lunch with a big group.  The only good thing Id say was the fried sushi.  Other than that the food was bland and not flavored very well.  Two stars I guess for the lunch buffet price considering their variety of sushi."}
{"text":"The Journey Sushi & Seafood Buffet (4325 Lien Rd, Madison, WI 53704) is the best buffet in town.  If you like sushi, seafood, or Chinese food this is the place to go.  The food is always fresh and we'll presented.  The hot food is always hot without being dry or overcooked unlike other buffets that keep the food hot by turning up the burners and drying out the food.  I especially like the variety of seafood  from crab to all kinds of shrimp.  They even have oysters on the half shell!  The selection of Chinese food is impressive and very tasty.  Their grill is great and you can select the items you want and they will grill them for you.  The restaurant is very clean with excellent lighting and a large number of booths and tables to select from.  The staff are very friendly and are very attentive to customer needs.  The price is fantastic with dinner at $12.85...WOW!  Try this place and you will be a regular like I am. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This is about what you can imagine when you think of an all you can eat buffet. Great if you're extremely hungry, all you can eat buffet for an incredible price. If you're looking for quality on the other hand, look elsewhere. Food tastes as if it's been sitting out. Things that should be crunchy, are more of a chewy consistency. All in all, not impressed."}
{"text":"There was a wide selection of food, but fried items were soft and chewy, not crisp and food could have been warmer.  Doing a few things well would work better than having so many so-so options."}
{"text":"Journey was my first ever sushi buffet experience. I definitely didn't go into it expecting to be blown away, but I was pleasantly surprised!

The sushi wasn't the best I've ever had by a long shot, but it definitely satisfied my craving and I loved the variety. My husband and I went for their lunch buffet on a Monday afternoon and they must have had 12-15 different rolls up for grabs!

I didn't have much other non-sushi food except for the soft-serve dessert, but they had 4+ other buffet lines with non-sushi offerings.

Journey will definitely do for sushi in a pinch, but I'll probably go to one of the other sushi restaurants in the area for my sushi fix in the future."}
{"text":"We've been going in to this place since they open, our place to go on weekends. Good food and cheap price compare to other buffets in Madison. We've been to most asian and non asian restaurants in Madison and surrounding areas, this place is a keeper. Food is not overly salty, most restaurants can't even taste the food itself.! It's all salty. My fav. Is the fresh Mongolian grill station and Pho station. Would have gave this a 5 star but their ladies bathroom need a ventilation, there is hot water in the restroom, good sign.! it's clean but few times I went to the restroom,smells really bad. It reeks! can't stand it.!  I just don't use the bathroom there at all for how often we eat there on weekends. To the owner. Please put some air freshener in the restroom, have someone clean more often and empty garbage during busy hours. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great selection of seafood and sushi, as the name implies, but that's not all. There was a wide selection of other food as well, so your whole group can find something they like. The price is quite reasonable for what you are getting and the service was attentive and quiet. I Know we'll be back because we couldn't try everything, even though we stuffed ourselves."}
{"text":"Best buffet/restaurant I've been to in awhile.. Food was awesome. Can't wait to go back. Sooo rooting for this place to succeed. Then the east side would finally have a decent place to eat. Love it:)"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't good.. Could be better... Overall chinese food...hmm okay..... 
What i like the most? Pho station!!!!! This alone earns 4 stars from me :)!!!  I was impressed by it and had so much fun having the chef make pho with the toppings I like!!!! I just wish more Chinese buffet places have pho station like this place!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night with two of my kids and we were all VERY disappointed with both the food and the service. Some of the buffet items were burnt and cold, some under cooked and warm/cold, and something I brought back on my plate from the salad area was actually spoiled and smelled rancid!!  We used to make it a point to eat at this place and based our last few very unimpressive visits...we've decided to make it a point to ALWAYS avoid this place. There are way too many other really good restaurants in Madison to keep spending money here on bad food and poor service. Bye Journey ...good luck and try NOT to give too many other people food poisoning."}
{"text":"Great selection of food.
Good service.
I love to eat LYCHEE there .
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Want to get filled up on sushi, and Chinese food?   Here's your place. This building is huge, and there are a couple different dining rooms. The buffet selection is also huge. Plenty of cold salad and fruit offerings, seafood of course, as well as plenty of steaming Chinese entrees and a smattering of American selections. Quality of food and flavors is better than good. Hey, my crab rangoon wasn't soggy,  extra point there...I love that there is a nice variety of sushi displayed on ice, and replenished often, so you can get your sushi fix. Stay in and eat, or fill a to-go box. They will weigh it and charge you according to that.  Dinner price is around $13, and lunch is about $8. Lunch is from 11- 3:30.
I say, stop in and give them a try! You can most definitely get your money's worth during the lunch time!"}
{"text":"5 star for many reasons! But I won't tell you any, you have to come and experience  yourself! Hahah"}
{"text":"I decided to come here on Mothers Day because a) I am a mother, and b) I like to eat food. Lots of food. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't really pleased, either. The price was jacked up for the \"holiday\" and I think I paid $15 for the buffet, per person, including two preteens, who just ate garlic bread and sugar buns. There is a ton of food here, but a lot of it is weird cheesy seafood casseroles, gloppy Americanized dishes, and questionable crab dishes. 
I ended up eating a lot of breaded shrimp, and some fried rice--the basics. 

I might come here again if I have the hankering to mindlessly eat a large quantity of food, and I don't care much about the quality. Sometimes that's the mood I'm in. But if I'm looking for a Chinese buffet, I won't be going here. Too expensive, and not enough truly good or delicious items on the buffet."}
{"text":"It ain't so bad.

I mean, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet, so don't walk in expecting the moon.  

That being said, it's better than I thought it would be.  The service was good. The food was decent for AYCE. The selections were wide and varied.  I'm not going to hate on this one.

The sushi wasn't the best.  Hy-Vee has better sushi, but for all-you-can-eat, you shut the heck up and eat it.  

The dessert selection was the least impressive thing to me, but even that was okay.  

I will go back.  I'm not in any hurry to go back.  But I will go back."}
{"text":"I've been missing Oysy since it closed. 

Journey is as good or better. Only thing I missed was peel and eat shrimp. Aside from that it has all the expected items at a Chinese buffet such as this. 

Overall quality is terrific, even my wife who doesn't like fried Chinese food enjoyed it. 

Next time I'll try the stir fry in back!"}
{"text":"Disgusting buffet style food. What happened to this place?? It used to be so good. First visit in awhile since I live on the other side of town. Strong fish smell when you walk in -- not the fresh fish smell -- more like sitting in a pan for a very long time smell. The food was old and the sushi was crusted. We will never return."}
{"text":"This buffet is epic! I had been meaning to try this restaurant when we got a coupon in the mail. As it turns out the buffet is extremely affordable with or without a coupon. $9 for an adult lunch on a weekday!

The food options on offer seemed endless. There must have been 200+ different items on offer. Everything was included in the base price!

There was a lineup of sushi in front with all the fixings. A couple of chefs were making more rolls right behind the counter. I wouldnt recommend the tempura rolls but all the other varieties were delicious.

Next up was a salad bar with the usual offerings plus a lot of extras like edamame, seaweed salad, broccoli salad, and beady eyed shrimp on ice.

Behind that was a line of dessert offerings complete with ice cream machine. I tried a mini chocolate parfait that was delicate amd flavorful!

Next up was the main course. 5 buffet stations full of warm food. Everything from General Tso's chicken to stuffed mushrooms, fried rice to french fries. There were also a few kid friendly dishes on show. I saw cheese pizza, mac and cheese and chicken strips.

If that weren't enough I was excited to find two made to order options on the back wall. You could make your own mongolian wok or pho soup and they would cook it right in front of you.

Its going to take a couple visits to try everything, but I'm willing to make the sacrifice ;) A special shoutout to the chinese doughnuts that brought me back to my childhood!"}
{"text":"Why so many stars people? I'm assuming because it's inexpensive? New to Madison area. Coming from California. So I've tried plenty of Chinese/Asian foods and none were ever as disappointing. Upon entering, the moist smelling, black stained carpets already threw me off. I know Chinese food tastes different when you go to different states. (I've traveled and tasted Chinese food elsewhere. And some say it's because the people are from different areas of China...makes sense!) But I found not one thing I liked here! Not even one! What?! And I'm not a fancy fufu person whatsoever. Lol. Just tasted odd and the fried things tasted like old oil had been used. 
Sadly, will not be returning...ever."}
{"text":"Well, it's not great. It's not terrible. It's also a buffet, where food doesn't tend to taste good, but you get a lot of food for not too much money. If you haven't eaten until you hate yourself, then you didn't do a buffet correctly.

It's nice that they have a variety of food. I wouldn't necessarily come for the seafood though... It's questionable... Seafood shouldn't have that \"fish smell.\" That sounds silly, but if it smells like bad fish or overly fishy, then it is no good.

Highly recommend the fried donuts, because I have no standards and that is my favorite buffet dish.

I do not love the sushi. I do not recommend the sushi. I would definitely go somewhere else for sushi than eat questionable raw sushi. 

Oh. I was semi-annoyed when we had to change tables 3 times because the servers didn't plan accordingly. There were four of us, and they put us at a 6 person table. So, when a 6 person party arrived, we had to move to a 4 person table that just opened up. It's not that big of a deal, but this was after they had already moved us to this second 6 person table because another party wanted to sit at the particular table at which we were sitting."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and offered a huge variety.  Fresh, cold, hot soup, salads, many dishes from pho to sushi to crab.  There was enough variety to keep the younger ones happy- french fries, spaghetti, pizza as well.  Taboes settings for large groups too and conveniently located near East towne mall. 
The price was reasonable for lunch, definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Ehm, if you are looking for some quality and tasty sushi, this is not the place for you!
They do have a number of variants, but none is to my taste.... They are just blah *sorry*

But the seafood is okay. If you are craving for some crab, shrimp, fish and other seafood, you can give this place a try.

And will I ever go back? No, not really, unless I really miss having some seafood, which may not happen in the near future. 
As for my sushi fix, I will definitely look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for dinner the other night, and we were very pleased.  Hubby loves the sashimi, and ate his fill of it.  I, on the other hand, detest raw fish, and they have a very nice selection of foods for those of us that don't do the sushi/sashimi dealeo.  Rock crab, stuffed crab, garlic lobster, baby clams, and several \"Chinese\" dishes,  etc.  
We will be back."}
