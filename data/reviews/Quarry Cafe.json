{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot! Staff were very friendly and attentive. Real potatoes for home fries. Bacon cooked perfectly. Everything was delicious and all for reasonable price. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I usually go to The Quarry in the evenings, however, lately I have tried it for weekend brunch.  In their defense they are very busy, but the service is terrible.  Our order was taken after others had arrived and then it still took an additional 10 minutes to get coffee and juice.  Our waitress charged us $4.95 to add a slice of ham to a grilled cheese sandwich and in the end she messed up our bill

Last time I ordered the club house sandwich and it was fine, I had the breakfast potatoes instead of fries and found them to be inedible.  My daughter's grilled cheese must have been made on the same surface because it had the same flavour.  The only way to describe it was rancid. 

This is too bad.  The staff that work on weekdays are so nice and are reason enough to visit.  Weekends, however, should be avoided."}
{"text":"This is a horrible spot if you have children. The owners are trashy and make you feel unwelcome. Do not go. After horrible service and a lecture about how my 16 month old should have respect and not throw food on the floor I refused to tip. The lady actually called me on it and said\" so because of way he treat you I get no tip\" I wanted to say yes because I saw you complain to your husband about my baby and because you didn't really serve us!! But I was quite terrified of her so I ended up leaving a tip. I have never been back and I shall never go back!!! Save your money!!!"}
{"text":"WE often go to the Quarry for breakfast. The new owners are making every effort to satisfy old customers, and we are very, very happy with the food and service. The breakfasts are great!! we hope to make it there for dinner soon. They changed a few things when they first opened up that we thought were so-so, and we made suggestions and they really listened. 
We are impressed. The new, clean environment is very pretty and a big improvement. Great to have them in the hood!  Lynne & Steve"}
{"text":"We decided to go here for breakfast this morning after a recommendation from a family member.  We got there early enough to grab a sunny window table and the place was slowly filling up after our arrival.

The service was outstanding!  VERY attentive server, very pleasant, and humourous.
My SO and I both ordered the Quarry breakfast....2 eggs any way, bacon or sausage or peameal bacon, 2 slices of toast, homefries, coffee.  
Kids had pancakes and eggs w'toast, homefries.  I also ordered a fresh fruit cup and it was fresh....not the the kind of fruit that comes in buckets that some restaurants use...this was fresh cut strawberries, melon, grapes, and slices of fresh banana on top...DELISH!
The portion sizes were perfect and the food was tasty.

It's not huge in there so it can fill up quickly.  I would try to get there before ten.
It's nice and bright, as they have a skylight in the middle of the ceiling.
They also have a patio for when it warms up. 
This is going to be our new breakfast place..."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place. The staff are extremely friendly and food is what is expected. I had the crepes and sausages. It was quite delicious. My friend ordered their version on the big breakfast and yeah... It was big enough that it couldn't be finished. The coffee though, wasnt as good. It taste like it was out of a old can.lol but ye other than that, worth heading for a meal :)"}
{"text":"Still very good, and I wanted to add that a couple of my friends, who are connoisseurs of  corned beef hash thought it was excellent, including the perfectly poached eggs to put on top."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to this neighborhood from the downtown core, and this has become our new weekend brunch spot. Really good food, and at good prices too. The quantity is also quite large. Service has been very good every time we've been here, and this is despite it getting very busy over weekends. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast spot.  I don't think I'd go outta my way to get here, but if I was nearby, I would't bother going farther afield.  Avoid the back bacon.  Other than that it was pretty good.  Chatty and commercial-laden AM radio on the patio was a bit annoying for me, but also made me feel like I was in a very small town which was kinda novel."}
{"text":"The Quarry is the go-to restaurant for my parents for years. 
In fact, the owner even knows all of us by name and always has presents for the little ones in our family on holidays. 

You can never go wrong with the soup, a burger or souvlaki there, and breakfast is always fantastic. The fruit cups and coleslaw are always homemade and fresh."}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast most weekends. The staff are friendly, the meals are served quickly; really just good breakfast food"}
{"text":"The Quarry is our local diner and we often will call up in advance with our order to pick it up and take it home. The food consists of typical diner type entr√©es: lasagne, pork chops, burgers, fish and chips, etc.

The wait staff have been there for years and are always friendly. Often there will be only one on, however, and the restaurant will be jam-packed making table visits a little bit less frequent than desired.

Breakfast at the Quarry is delicious. It isn't out of this world but for a fair price you get lots of food. We particularly enjoy the pancake and sausage combos. The pancakes are fluffy and the sausage salty. What more do you want?

For lunch and dinner we'll order the grilled cheese and different sandwiches. The grilled cheese is large and greasy - not disgusting greasy but if you're looking for an artisan grilled cheese - this isn't it.

We return regularly, usually three times a month."}
{"text":"What a great little spot .... I'm from Philly and I've always found Toronto to be a little bland when it comes to breakfast scene. But, a few weekends ago  I tried this little spot hidden away on Gerrard near Warden.   Banana crepe was out this world ....It came with a bowl of  fruit  and plain yogurt ...the fruit (berries and such) was fresh and high quality and could have been dish in i self. The Eggs Florinitne were also ridiculously good....very fresh tasting spinach  and seasoned just right.   The Blue Cheese Burger was soooo good .... again quality ingredients ...high grade ground beef  and delicious strong blue cheese.. . Fries were  also yummy..   It was a Sunday- The place seem modestly packed with people coming from church....but I definitely think this place hasn't really been discovered - I want to recommend it especially because the rest of the restaurant scene in that area (and even the entire beaches to the south)  is kinda crappy."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place! Especially if you have little ones! I have gone for breakfast and the service was pretty good and the food not terrible, its pretty hard to mess up breakfast! I decided to go for dinner and the service was horrible, as well as the food. Not to mention they complained that my 15month old through a bit of food on the floor and the owner, also the cook came out and told me that I need to start teaching my child how to behave now! And then he started to lecture my baby! I understand the little guy through food on the floor, he does it all day long at home and we clean it up and tell him its wrong! Of course he laughs since he really doesnt get it yet!!! However this is suppose to be a family place! Where families can feel comfortable! I was so upset I said forget the pumpkin pie and paid and was about to leave! I didnt tip because it was sso horrible, then the waitress called me on it and said so what! Because he said that you, you dont tip me! I was crying now! and actually gave her 10 bucks because I was shaking and couldnt do the math!! It was horrible! They should be shut down! Please support other places that love and understand families! Id honestly like to think that the owner wasnt really the owner and that the waitress was lying because he was so horrible, and from other reviews it just doesnt make sense that this experience happened to us! Im still shaking!"}
