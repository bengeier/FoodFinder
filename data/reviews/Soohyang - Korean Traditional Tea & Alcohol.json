{"text":"Soohyang's was awesome.  My two friends took me today, and I was pleasantly surprised by the pleasant atmosphere.  It had a very relaxing but hip and cool vibe.  Ella Fitzgerald-type music was playing softly as we sipped our teas (I had the jujube tea) and ate our green tea ice cream and waffles.  The owner is so kind and friendly.  She came over and welcomed me (she recognized my friends as a regulars) and was happy to explain the different items on the menu.  She offers all-around great customer service and is cool and hip to match the vibe of the place.  The teahouse itself is so cutely decorated - minimalist, but with a definite theme and attention to detail.  I'd definitely recommend this place to all of my friends, whether they frequently drink tea or not (I think there are plenty of different teas that everyone will be able to find something they like).  It's a cute place for a date, or a fun place for a group of friends to sit and chat over tasty treats.  I'll plan my next trip there soon!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely my go to destination for having a good time with friends or alone time. The tea is superb!!! The food is yummy! The owner is super friendly. You can tell she really cares about everything she does"}
{"text":"Very bad experience! You have to order 1 tea for each person whatever how many dessert you ordered. There is no Knife available. We were told to eat the waffle by using our hand. Finally, we finished a waffle with wooden spoon and a mini size fork. The tea is OK, but not worth for $5 with a Tim Horton small cup size (Or even smaller). The seats are uncomfortable for a tea house which people usually spending time to relax. I won't go again."}
{"text":"I usually don't do online reviews but I had to share my experience of this place!  I was super excited when I saw a korean traditional tea house open and was not disappointed. The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable.   Was welcomed by a very kind and bubbly lady who does not hesitate to make nice conversations with you. She offered me a mason jar of hot water to hold on to because my hands were cold.   During my two visits here, I ordered apple tea with sweet potato and cheese, and chrysanthemum tea with rice cake pizza. All very decadent and sweet. The presentation and taste of both tea and dessert were lovely and delicious.   It's a great place to come and study during the weekdays or to relax and have a nice conversation with your friends!  I definitely recommend this place for anyone who is interested in trying authentic Korean tea and desserts, or anyone who wants to try something different."}
{"text":"Had traditional Korean tea in Korea before, but couldn't find anywhere in Toronto. So happy that here's one finally. I ordered Omija Tea and rice cake with cheese pizza, and they are delicious. Perfect for this cold and rainy weather!"}
{"text":"Cozy little tea shop with a very relaxing and peaceful environment! We got the \"weight loss tea\" not sure what the actual name is but it was very tasty! We also ordered the green tea matcha waffle, injeolmi pizza and the rice cakes with honey, but I liked the tea the best :). The owner was super friendly and helpful!!! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard that a traditional Korean tea shop had opened in Toronto and Soohyang didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly with a understated look.  I went with two friends and ordered the jujube tea (daechu cha) first as it was recommended by the owner as being good for my slightly sore throat. It was delicious and surprisingly soothing. One of my friends also ordered the jujube tea and my other friend ordered the medicinal herbal tea (ssanghwa cha) because she had a cold. The presentation of the teas was lovely, each came out on a wooden tray with a small dish of candied ginger and a traditional Korean cookie (yakgwa).  We actually stayed quite a while so ordered another round of tea, this time we all ordered schizandra tea (omija cha) and snacks - Korean rice cakes with honey and my friends shared the glutinous rice cake pizza (which is definitely big enough for sharing if you're just having it as a snack). Again, we all enjoyed our tea and the snacks were a nice accompaniment to it.  All in all, I highly recommend the tea shop. It has great teas and a friendly vibe."}
{"text":"A nice little tea shop with really nice interiors. Serves traditional Korean tea that's unique around this area. Also has great selection of snacks to go with it. Definitely try the schizandra tea as it is very flavorful."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place. My bf and I passed by here and never saw it before and decided to check it out. We were greeted by the owner who was so friendly and personable - some of the best service I've had from a Korean place. We got the matcha green tea ice cream with waffles, rice cake pizza and a tea and coffee.  It was pretty empty when we went so the food came pretty fast. I loved the presentation and little plates and utensils - it really had bits of Korean history which was cute. The food was good and I really enjoyed the matcha ice cream!! The tea I got - green plum tea was also very nice and soothing.   Food is 4/5 but 5 stars for service!!"}
{"text":"Soohyang was definitely a unique experience. I was surprised by the simple and modern decor. The owner greeted my companion and I, and brought over a very cute booklet containing all the info and benefits of each tea. This isn't your typical tea house, the owner did her best to educate customers of Korean culture, and recommended tea suitable for us. We ended up getting the jujube tea (never had it, surprisingly good), and the ssangwhacha (not as bitter as imagined, which is good). The tea was good but the price might be a little much. I guess the price premium can be justified by the experience and environment.   For snacks we ordered the honey butter cheese sweet potato, green tea ice cream with matcha waffle, and Korean rice cake with honey. All the food items were pretty good. I felt the sweet potato could use a little more cheese (could just be due to my love for cheese), and the rice cake was a tad overpriced as it really was just small pieces of rice cake. Highlight of the meal, though, was definitely the green tea ice cream. The taste of green tea was very strong, definitely one of the best ones I've had around GTA.  Overall, a very cute and relaxing place to hang out with friends or just to read a book. Great experience. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Somehow stumbled upon a pic from Soohyang via instragam and immediately dragged the husband out to try the very next day.  I remembered having tea in Seoul and it was very pleasant and relaxing. This place did not disappoint, however still a far stretch from my Seoul teahouse experience.  I had the ssangwahcha (medicinal herbal tea) and was promptly warned by the owner it's a bit bitter. Since I'm chinese, I figured it can't be worst than the chinese 24 herbal tea...and as my parents would always say \"the bitter the tea the better the benefits\" The husband had the green plum tea, which he said has a lot of flavor to it and very refreshing to taste. We also ordered the rice cake pizza and the pumpkin porridge. The rice cake pizza was a great compliment to the tea, a bit sweet but not overly sweet, perfect balance. The pumpkin porridge was just ok....its basically just pumpkin puree.   I like the presentation and the attention to detail at this place, the owner is very friendly and doesn't mind explaining the teas and benefits to you. However I was a bit disappointed that my teas didn't come with a little snack like those pictured here...no crystal ginger or mochi. For the price of $6+/cup, I expect a little more."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this tea house. The owner is so friendly and you can really tell shes passionate about her shop and her products.  We tried all her recommendations and it was amazing. We got the rose tea, chrysanthemum tea, and the jujube tea. We also got this small pizza with cheese and cereal powder and honey - sounds weird but tastes amazing. The owner also gave us two little free cookies.  The ambiance is super relaxing and perfect for you and your friend to catch up or on a date with your boyfriend/girlfriend.   Next time I come here, I'll definitely be trying the soju drinks!"}
{"text":"It is a very cute and authentic Korean tea shop you can not find anywhere else in Toronto. Tea aroma and soft music definitely calm your nerves. I had a ginger tea with a pumpkin porridge. They were so delicious and warmed up my body in chilly weather. I will definitely go back to try other menu."}
{"text":"owner is really nice and the food was good...the tea wasn't piping hot, though, so hence minus one star"}
{"text":"Soohyang Traditional Tea House is a great place to enjoy traditional and super healthy Korean teas (and snacks).  When I first found out about Soohyang, this was uncharted territory (traditional Korean teas?!) and I knew I just had to come here. It was absolutely frigid today and it was absolutely perfect to come here to drink some warm tea.  Bonnie the owner was extremely nice and made some really good recommendations. There was a cute handmade tea booklet which dwelve into more information and the health benefits of all the teas they offer here. I was initially supposed to go with the rose pot but Bonnie recommended the jujube tea (daechu cha) because the rose tea was more for scent/fragrance and also because the jujube tea was a good choice for guys. The booklet also indicated that the tea reduces stress/anxiety, prevents skin aging, amongst a whole slew of benefits. The jujube tea was really good and I liked the sweetness of it. The interesting part was that the jujubes were all in the tea so they floated down due to density and I was told to mix it before drinking. I also tried the cinnamon apple tortilla which was super tasty. It consisted of apple, cinnamon, chestnuts, amongst other various seeds and nuts. It went well with the teas and made for a light, healthy snack.  There's subtle differences between what guys and girls got which was cute. Guys got ginger candy and different cups, fork rests, and mats while the girl in our group had an entirely different set.  I suppose the value could have been a bit more fair, $6 for a small-ish cup can be a bit steep (no pun intended!), but when it's good for you, I guess it's okay.  I really like this place overall, the interior is minimalistic, and clean, and with good teas and wonderful service, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed.  I think it was only the owner that was working that day so things were a little slow but not a problem, we were not in a rush.  If it is your first time, REMEMBER TO ASK FOR THE TEA BOOK.  It was so busy the owner forgot to give us one and we kinda just ordered what was familiar.  Food and drinks ============== - We ordered a fruit smoothie of the day, a hot lemon tea, and a roasted rice cake with honey. - We didn't know what to order and unfortunately we only found out about the Tea Book after we were done. - It was ok.   - The rice cakes were good as well.  Service ============== Friendly but she definitely could have used some helpers.  Cleanliness ============== We were given fork holders (like chopstick holders).  These things looked home made which is cool, they are basically (3) 1cm squared blocks of wood glued together, and with some decorations glued on.  But the issue was that they were dirty.  Bits of food were on mine and if you look closely some food was stuck under the decorations on the glue.  Another one that we had was still wet with some sort of yellow syrup on it...  I'm going to say it was an oversight since it was just the (1) owner working but it didn't leave a good impression.  Would we go back? =============== Once more for the summer shaved ice and traditional tea."}
{"text":"Little cute gem a little north of yonge and steeles! This Korean traditional teahouse is great for catching up with your friends or even coming on your own to just relax to read a book. The cafe is quite small so it'll never be too loud and rowdy. The owner is super friendly and loves chatting and giving recommendations. The decor here is super cute and instagrammy - it just gives a nice warm and homey vibe!  I didn't order any drinks this time (ironically) but just came for the snacks. As recommended, I tried the injeolmi pizza and my god, it was DELICIOUS. We ordered the dumplings as well, but the pizza really is unique and it satisfies any sweet/savory cravings.   I will definitely have to come back sometime to try the sweet potato!"}
{"text":"Cute little Korean cafe just north of Yonge and Steeles on the east side.  Though the exterior plaza may not appeal, the inside however is cute, contemporary and chilled out!  This place serves up some traditional Korean teas, desserts and shareable hot snacks.   You can spend hours in this ambiance and as for selections, they've got a range of things they offer.  Their prices are reasonable as well. Coming here with a group of 4, we were here for some drinks. I decided to try their Melona Popsicle dipped in sprite and spiked with SOJU...served up in a glass jar with a straw, cute.  If you're looking for a low-key place to catch up with some friends over a small bite and drinks, this place would be ideal."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came today to catch up. Aside from two older gentlemen, the store was empty upon our arrival this Sunday afternoon.  We were greeted by a warm smile from the store owner who promptly brought a booklet menu and explained the many options.  We ordered two teas, one \"pizza\", one order of sweet potatoes and one matcha ice cream + waffles. The owner told us that these were the most popular items. When the dishes arrived, we could see why. The food was delicious and looked very cute. The flavours were brave combinations but worked wonderfully. Kudos.  The store owner was very nice and did not come around too many times which allowed us to catch up. She later explained that renovations will be happening sometime.  This tea house is a gem of a find. Great atmosphere and interesting dishes. Definitely a great place to check out for tea time."}
{"text":"Lovely would be the word to use when describing this little tea haven.  We learned a lot about traditional teas and the unique snacks that the owner prepared carefully for us.    As soon as we entered, we were greeted by a peaceful ambiance and thoughtful decor.  The photos speak for themselves. Our teas were very fresh and tasty, as were the rice cake toast and roasted sweet potatoes we ordered.   It's truly a unique experience you have to try for yourself to appreciate all of the thoughts and effort put towards everything you find here.    P.S. the serene surrounding and welcoming atmosphere makes it a fantastic atmosphere for work and studying!  Free Wifi is available.  We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Soohyang is a serene and cozy tea shop in the daytime with a light-filled, natural space. It's the perfect spot for some afternoon conversations with friends or solo contemplations over aromatic tea (the cinnamon punch is my fave and the cups are so cute!), and the deeeelicious Injeolmi Pizza on the side. I cannot express how yummy the Injeolmi Pizza is. Seriously, you must try it.  In the evening, the tea house serves funky and fun Korean soju cocktails. My recommendation is that you try the Melona Soju cocktail that comes with a Melona stick you stir in. Soo divine.  On top of that, the service is A+++. Bonnie, the owner, is kind, friendly, considerate, and a great conversationalist!   I highly recommend Soohyang"}
{"text":"I came to this place for the second time with a different group of friends. The owner recognized me which was pretty cool. Same as the my previous review, I had a great experience here. The owner was friendly, the place was relaxing. The only difference was the food. The owner saw my review on here and actually made improvements which is really good. My friend got what I had last time (the sweet potatoes with honey and cheese) and it was much better (not that it was bad before either). This time I got the rose tea and the rice cake pizza (not sure if that's the actually name) and it has became my favorite rice cake dessert. If you like chewy food and cheese definitely give it a try. As for the rose tea, the owner explained that its a tea for scent not taste. So like I expected the tea didn't have a strong taste to it but the scent was really really nice. Would recommend rose tea for people who don't like strong tea. Will probably keep coming back."}
{"text":"I came here on a rainy afternoon on a weekday. I particularly like the vibe of this tea house because it's very cozy and cute. I like the small touches that they add (such as the rock on each table, the utensils, the decoration). On top of that, I thought that the owner was incredibly friendly.  They have two menus - one listing out the food and drinks that they offer and the other one is a complete description of most drinks and food.  I got the schizandra tea because it was a berry flavour. I thought it tasted good but nothing out of this world. I'm not a tea connoisseur but I thought that the flavour was there but it wasn't anything special (which is a slight disappointment since it is a tea house afterall).  For food, I got the honey butter cheese sweet potato and injulmi pizza. The sweet potato didn't have enough contrast in terms of the sweet and savory. However, the pizza had the right amount of balance. The sweet potato is a seasonal dish so it's probably not there in the upcoming spring/summer menu. However, I believe that the pizza is there year round which is wonderful because it's SO delicious.  I highly recommend this place for a cute date or a low key girls' day out. I'm definitely coming back to try the other food and of course the other tea."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to have Korean traditional tea but couldn't find any place in Toronto. Thankfully this awesome Korean tea shop just recently opened - right across the street from Galleria supermarket near Yonge & Steeles - and it's great!   It's got a nice selection of Korean traditional tea and even snacks. For those who don't know much about Korean tea, the owner had made a little book explaining everything about each tea they serve and their benefits. I had the chrysanthemum tea and rice cakes with honey today. Apparently chrysanthemum is good for the eyes and relieves cold symptoms. Taste-wise, it has a subtle flowery sweet taste, but it went perfectly with the rice cakes which are chewy and just sweet enough.  They're also served on flower trays with traditional tea pots and cups which are super cute, along with the decor. It's also got a pretty nice quiet atmosphere and soothing music. Definitely different from all those bubble tea places around the area. If you're looking for a traditional tea experience with a modern mix, this is the place for you. I can't wait to come back here to try some more of their tea! :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this hidden and unique gem, as bubble tea or other tea houses are dime a dozen. (Don't expect the speed and the atmosphere of those, either). The owner is clearly passionate about brewing these delicious teas (not with actual tea leaves, but fruits, berries etc so it's perfect if you don't want caffeine). The homemade green tea ice cream is sooo good! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The first of its kind in Toronto, this traditional Korean teahouse is really cute and Insta-worthy. Teas are quite pricey ($5-7 range) and the food is alright. I liked the cheese condensed milk pizza, a nice balance of sweet and savory. I don't recommend the chicken balls. The owner is super friendly and addresses any health concerns you may have with the appropriate tea to help your symptoms. Overall, I'd go back but maybe try a soju cocktail instead!"}
