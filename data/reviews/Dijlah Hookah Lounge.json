{"text":"By far the best Iraqi food I've had in the eastern part of the US, been as far as Michigan and Virginia and nothing comes close to these guys shawarma."}
{"text":"The food is EXCELLENT. We took Iraqi kebab, chicken shish kebab, baba ghanoush   and stuffed grape leaves. It was all very tasty but I would say that the iraqi kebab and baba ghanoush are to die for. The staff is very friendly once you open to them, but they still lack a little bit of experience and \"vigor\" ( They are a little bit shy). Anyway, I'm going there agin and again and again :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by dijlah on my way to smoky mountains because I was looking for authentic Middle eastern food. We had more than 5 different dishes and they all were great specially the Iraqi kebab is the best. This restaurant should open in New York or DC. I have been to more than 50 different middle eastern restaurants the past 8 years in the states but the this one is excellent. There are few things, such as management and waiters behavior and knowledge which is easy as long as they are good at food."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with delicious dishes, drinks, and hookah bookah. I enjoyed the meals especially their dijlah dish, Tabuleh, humus, and grape leaves."}
{"text":"Good tastey and prices. Good stuff and services because they called me to make sure about the boffet that I ordered  them to my party were good. Only negative thing is the parking. Thank you     .                 ."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and to the point: Go here! I'm half Iraqi and this is the closest to my Mom's cooking I've found in this part of the country. I loved everything but especially the stuffed grape leaves, babaghanouj, and baklava. The babghanouj, in particular, tasted exactly like my Mom's."}
{"text":"I have been to different countries and to different states in this country, and finding food that reminds me of delicious food just like from back home has been a real challenge. Few places can serve food that give that surge of satisfaction and Dijla is defiantly one of them."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern in town by far. Excellent hummus, vine leaves, baba, and more. It's fun to smoke hookah and watch Arab Idol too."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the combo platter for appetizer and Iraqi kebab sandwich. Both were good. Baba ganoush was my most favorite. Green tea was not that good but they have a very good turkish coffee. The problem is that they only have one server. She was really nice but she seemed to be the only one working in the whole restaurant.   Tip: they have a parking lot at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: very good, Iraqi food with choice of kebabs and lamb shank, came out with gentle and excellent flavor. Perfect rice, and decent sized portions.  Location and atmosphere: perfect location in Butler st, easy to access. Interior is made to feel homey and clothed in rugs and hanging sheets. The effect is slightly tacky and by no means fancy, but perfectly comfortable. No outdoor seating.  Service: average and not overly helpful.  We will be back to try more dishes and to come in the evening instead of on a weekend day."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Iraqi kabab. I like its seasoned lightly spiced up flavor which is quite different from Turkish and Levantine flavors, which are also great. However, Iraqis like Persians add a spicy flare twist to their grills. Gives it an edgy flavor. The added authenticity to the place was also nice. The comfy seating, and traditional middle eastern decorations and light lamps hanging off the ceiling. I'll definitely be back to try more Arabic dishes. Friendly staff and I think they tried to keep on top of things for all diners. There were couple of big group tables so that tends to occupy them more than smaller tables which is expected. I did not mind."}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing food. Unique experience!  My vote for the best food in Lawrenceville. A variety of teas, Turkish coffee, the best chicken sharwama I've had in years. Amazing service as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice food, decent service and reasonable prices. I have tried their Iraqi kabob wrap. It's a safe but good bet. Tea or qavah is also nice. Babaganosh is made well.  Chicken skewer is also good."}
{"text":"Really it is one of the best arabic restaurants i like it also the staff they are very nice also they have hookah far away from eating hall was very nice ."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and the food was phenomenal. The standouts were the stuffed grape leaves and the falafel. Also all the grilled meats were fantastic.  The portion sizes were all healthy, especially for the price. Service was outstanding. Only wish they didn't use so many styrofoam containers. :(  Will definitely be frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"This was our second trip in past few months and both experiences were fantastic. The atmosphere is amazing with a real feel of stepping out of Lawrenceville into another part of the world.  We have 3 children and appreciated the kids menu and very friendly/patient service. The kebabs were perfectly cooked and taste was as good as you will get in Pittsburgh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite of my family and my husbands friends. This lil Iraqi restaurant is popular with the Pgh Persian community. Iraqi cusine has some similarities to Persian which other Arab cuisines lack. Overall if your in the mood for pretty decent Iraqi cusine its up there. They occasionally have more pan-Khaleeji dishes as well such as Kabsa. Highly recommend. Decent rice by Iraqi and Persian standards. Hummos is very good as is the bread (nan/khoobz). I usually get a Vimto on the side. Just wish theyd start having KalehPache available 1x per week for breakfasts..."}
{"text":"I grew up in Oman and Qatar and this is where I come when I get homesick. Incredibly authentic food. Relaxing atmosphere. Genuine service."}
{"text":"I've only gotten take-out from here but it's always great. The lamb and the beef are fantastic, dolmas are tasty, and the baklava is out of this world. Definitely not spicy (which is a downside for me) but otherwise tasty food, nice owners, and good prices."}
{"text":"We went as a large group for lunch but had the place to ourselves. I had the kabob sandwich and it was ok. The french fries were tasty and the grape leaves were pretty good. Overall I think it is a decent place but it wouldn't be my first choice for the area/style of food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they opened and definitely plan on visiting again and again. Both times I've been met with friendly service and delicious food.  The food portions are generous and cost is inexpensive. This place is really worth going to."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer of Dijlah since it opened, and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. They really know what they're doing. The lentil soup is AMAZING, the spinach and feta pies are to die for, and the falafel is the best I've ever had. AND they have hookah in the back! The owner is very friendly, as are all the employees. I hope to see Dijlah stay in the area for a VERY long time!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. However, Bad service. We went there and it took the server more than 20 minutes to bring the men, we actually had to tell him \" hello were here\". It feels like the staff over here are not happy with their work, and they try to get this out on customers."}
{"text":"Excellent food and quite reasonable. We went as a party of 9. We ordered shawarma wraps, felafel wraps and kebab plates. My lamb shawarma saj was amazing. The meat inside was cook d to perfection and very authentic. We all loved it and look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I came here wanting to try something new.  I saw they had an interesting selection of teas.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Fleur de Mind so I ordered the Mango infused one which was very good. My entree, the Iraqi Kebab was delicious. The rice was so tasty, filling, and seemed so authentic, and the kebab was wonderfully flavored.  Shortly after I was handed the check but I also wanted dessert. However, they were out of what I wanted, which was named Dijlah something but I forgot and the online menu doesn't have it listed. My server and I exchanged small talk and he even helped me with some Arabic just prior to my paying the check and leaving.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 starts was because they did not have the tea and dessert that I wanted and that were listed on the menu, and also because I was given the check without being asked if I wanted dessert or anything else. These points are not really major, but I do feel it is customary, and good practice, to ask the patron if he or she wants anything else. All in all, food that is tasty, filling, authentic and satisfying coupled with good friendly service has earned a solid 4 star rating"}
{"text":"We were in Lawrenceville for a gallery walk and stopped here for an early dinner.  The chicken Teeka and the Iraqi grill were excellent. We ordered a pot of steaming tea which blended well with the dinner. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Microwaved awful lunch with bad service, and Maury povitch blaring on the tv. Would love to see this place close."}
{"text":"Nice decor with colorful pillows. Their portion is generous. The service was friendly. The food could have been better and not overcooked. They could at least keep their  bread warm and separate them from the salad so they would not be soggy."}
{"text":"I can walk here in 5 minutes and eat delicious, fairly-priced Middle Eastern food. Nothing I've ever had here has been anything but somewhere on the tasty-to-excellent-scale. Seating along the wall is super comfortable as well! How is that NOT worth 5 stars?"}
{"text":"Let me preface, this is my 1st and probably only yelp review. I'm not from Pittsburgh and I'm a sheesha/hookah snob. I came here hoping to eat and smoke and do work which is asking alot of sheesha spot, however it exceeded expectations on all fronts. There's a back room with chill music and outlets to do work. I had a Iraqi chicken wrap which was bomb, a starbuzz hookah, tea, and diet coke and I paid 22 dollars ?!! Service was amazing and the bowl was packed with respect lol. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the service was actually speedy, but a little rough. I think they have taken the criticism to heart, and 2 young men were hustling to serve great hummus, and maybe even better babaganooj! Prices are very reasonable for Larryville, the decor is different...my shawarma was very flavorful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Only giving one star because zero stars isn't allowed. No stars. I ordered a falafel sandwich and a chicken shwarma sandwich. I asked for no pita with the shwarma, they charged me for a platter ($6 more... And still used pita) SEVENTEEN dollars for some crappy rice chicken and a mediocre falafel sandwich and on top of that there was a hair. Thanks but no thanks. Total fail."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars.  I've been here thrice (mildly amused that I got to legitimately use this word).  All three times the food was great. Perfectly cooked meats (dryer than an average meat dish.  But this is how it's supposed to be made.  Lamb with a dash of cinnamon flavoring.  Delicious yogurt based dips for wraps.   Two times the service was good.  The first time we went however, was probably the worst service I've experienced since the late Del's restaurant (which may is definitely in the top 5 of worst Italian-related things, up there with Benito Mussolini).  There were three gentlemen working, and as many tables occupied.  I've never been so poorly treated by a wait staff.  We had a large group of 8, and had made reservations.  They took a long time to get our waters.  And then we waited longer to have someone take our order.  Then we waited longer still to get our food (I understand there is a wait time between ordering and receiving, but this felt extra long).  We enjoyed our meal and were ready to leave.  No one acknowledged us.  We sat there and did all the passive-aggressive symbols (make direct eye contact with your waiter, put your napkins on your plate, cough) until my wife eventually just asked our server.  He looked up from the table (it was his friends, whom weren't eating) and gestured with a single finger, as if to say 'one minute' and went back to speaking to his friends.  We waited for 5-10 more minutes and received our check.  The fact that the food was so good made me go back.  But I ordered takeout the next time.  Last time I was there was for lunch, when the restaurant was empty and the service was great (a younger girl who was extremely nice was our server).  Like I said, I normally hate when someone craps all over a restaurant due to a relatively minor anecdotal-evidence based event, but this became the standard bearer of bad service.  But, they've improved significantly since, so I can't ding them too hard.  (Once again, this food is great).  Go check it out, but avoid it if it's all the dudes working there, as they seemed more intent on hanging out than running a restaurant.  If there's a gal there, go in and enjoy great service.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Michael Jackson.  Obviously capable of greatness, but also capable of awful things (allegedly)."}
{"text":"We made our first trip to Dijlah tonight and it was delicious.  Two of us had chicken shawarma and I had a combo plate of chicken shawarma and an Iraqi kebab.  Both were delicious, portions were giant (and therefore very reasonably priced), and our server was super nice and efficient.  Hummus was good and our server kept the pita coming when we ran out.  Turkish coffee was just okay.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will be back."}
{"text":"We were trying to find a local spot with hookah and food, at the same time. It was hard to find in Pittsburgh it was either hookah or food well not even food you had tea or something like that. So when we found it we were happy. However you couldnt have hookah and food until after 930. The reason? I believe because it was Ramadan. So there is a dining area and a back portion with a projector and a hookah area. The seating is traditional floor or low seating in the back portion.  So we get here a little after 9 and we still have to wait until 930 for hookah, which is fine. We order some food to hold us over. We ordered the Iraqi kabob, french fries, a mint lemonade and a mango strawberry smoothie. The food was ok, not the best ive had. Oh yea most of the food comes with rice but in the back room where the hookah is there is no rice allowed. im guessing it because of rice and the carpet? The food was about a B- which isnt bad. I ordered grilled onions for an extra dollar and I got a half of onion, yes an entire half that had been on the grill long enough to get grill marks but not to be cooked.   We ordered a hookah in a pineapple they were out so we opted for a orange. There was one guy making all of the hookahs so it took a while for it to be made and brought out to us. Once it came it was good no complaints. The prices for the food and hookah were on point. Its lower then what we would pay in Milwaukee.   Of the hookah spots in Pittsburgh this is the one that i would choose to go to if ever in town again."}
{"text":"The wait is somewhat annoying, but worth it because the food is so good!  I got the lentil soup, Rice Kubah, and the Pistachio Baklava.  It was all delicious!  The soup was very tasty and the perfect consistency.  It made me want a blanket! The Rice Kubah... NOT THE WHEAT...was crispy, warm,and melted in your mouth!  The Pistachio Baklava was the right texture with a sweet honey buttery taste. I love there Pistachio Baklava... I can't eat just one... and neither will you... unless your on a diet.  This place is worth the food !"}
{"text":"Something has changed at Dijlah.  I don't know if it's new management or new cooks, but there is something different about the food.  Unfortunately it's not an improvement.  We used to stop by fairly regularly, but now it has fallen out of our usual restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Great food and kabas specially the iraqi kababs but the service is very very poor! We had to ask multiple times for bread and water! They kept forgetting our requests and had to be reminded multiple times! Also they changed the order after taking long time saying they ran out of the rice which we ordered! Takes too long to process orders also! Would never go here for bad service but for iraqi kabas maybe !!"}
{"text":"I was here in Pittsburgh for one day, and I decided to have a lunch in Dijlah restaurant. The Iraqi kabob is so delicious. I highly recommend this place. I tried hundreds of Middle Eastern restaurants in Michigan and believe me... This is the best."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this restaurant because it is very close to where we live. We were hungry for a late dinner and ordered some food to go to bring back home. The food was ready in about 15 minutes and everything was great!   We are mostly veggie eaters so we each tried the falafel wrap, which was excellent. The falafel was crispy and warm, grilled with veggies in a pita wrap. The wraps came with a fresh cucumber sauce that we put on the wraps, a great addition. We tried the tabouli, which was also fresh and delicious. We also shared a spinach + feta pie from the appetizer section.   This was a LOT of fresh food for a great price, we will definitely be going back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered through grub hub. Waited the 40 minutes we were told and then went to pickup. The staff had not even started our order. They said they 'didnt see it'. Apparently there is only one worker there who checks the Grub Hub printer and he 'hadnt looked in awhile'. Wasn't even apologetic - he said that he wasn't even sure they had confirmed the order, whatever that means (I had gotten a text confirming the order a few minutes after placing it.)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine, who knows authentic Middle Eastern food very well, recommended the restaurant to me.  I had the Iraqi Chicken Kebab and a mint lemonade and both were excellent.  The service was good and the atmosphere was nice.  The new ownership is taking this place in a great direction.  I will be returning to Dijlah to enjoy their food, again, very soon."}
{"text":"Very good food! The appetizer plate was a great selection. The falafel was also tasty. Had the chicken shawarma entree which was also delicious. Huge portions too! We did wait a while for our food, but they were setting up the buffet. It was worth it!"}
{"text":"I genuinely can't believe this place has this high of a star rating. The cleanliness is a big issue for me, before getting our food I made a trip to the restroom which was infested with bugs and bug traps. I felt like I needed a shower. It ruined the rest of my dining experience. When the food arrived it not only looked but tasted off. After two bites we politely paid our check and left our food to find other dinner options."}
{"text":"I am writing this review out of disappointment,and pretty hungry I might add. Being that I was raised on middle eastern food my entire life, I feel this was the worst I've ever had. Me and the bf stayed in bed all day and didn't feel like cooking, but were craving something really good. He stated he was craving dolmas after having some extraordinary ones at kassabs on the south side. So it was decided we were going to place a order through postmates. We decided on 2 orders of their stuffed grape leaves,a chicken shawarma wrap, and the grilled lamb entree. The order arrived in a short time,and at this point we were starving and had our tastebuds ready for some flavorful fare, instead what we received was super salty,gristly poor quality food. Starting with the grape leaves,SALT. That was the only thing we were able to taste. They arrived messy and and loose,rice busting out of them. The texture itself was a mushy salty mess and they were burned! Meaning they were cooked improperly and left in a warmer all day,allowing the leave to become burnt. He was so exited to have dolmas again as he is new to middle eastern/ethnic food and I'm disappointed that this is what he experienced. Next we have the chicken shawarma, a classic and comfortable introduction to Mid East food that some how managed to fail miserably. The meat tasted gamey and dirty and was a strange color. It was almost a reddish grey color and clearly a really cheap cut. It Taste like boiled chicken thighs. No seasoning,no spice,no flavor but a nasty dirty after taste. And finally, coup de grâce....the Lamb Tekka, which I was really looking forward to was inedible. Upon opening the container,the bf and I were both impressed by how it looked and the presentation, sadly were left more than disappointed,disgusted is a understatement. What I was expecting to me succulent medium cooked chunks of beautiful lamb,we received the driest, fatty,gristle and sinew laden piece of meat I've ever had on my plate. We attempted to each eat a piece,but we were defeated and refused to pick through the coagulum of fibrous animal tissue.I couldn't believe that this restaurant that a getting rave reviews would serve such poor quality cuts of meat. The only reason I could begin to imagine anyone would give this place over one star is if they never had middle eastern food, and they have no clue what it's supposed to taste like.So here is where I drop the mic."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food!   As a former resident of Iraq...this prob comes closest to what I remember the food tasting like...had the kebab and it was delish.   Had to take one point off bc almost every table still had plates (I guess they are looking for more staff as there was only one person manning/hostessing/cleaning tables?).   Anyway...decor was good, service was quick, and food was pretty darn yummy."}
{"text":"Come hungry!  And patient. My group of 5 dined at Dijlah for the first time for a birthday dinner this past Saturday.  I REALLY can't say enough about the food. We started with hummus and a falafel appetizer. The hummus was delicious and the falafel was enough for an entire meal, easy. At $4.99 I was convinced the wrong item had been delivered.  To give you an idea of Dijlah's oversized portions - when my meal arrived I immediately asked for a box. I can throw down a lot of food, but this monstrosity was too enormous to even entertain the notion of finishing.  Still, I highly recommend the Mixed Grill - a selection of lamb, beef and chicken kabobs, with the best damn rice I've ever had and a simple salad with not-so-simple and amazing dressing. Incredible. All of it. My dinner companions enjoyed a variety of falafel wraps, Iraqi kabobs and grape leaves, and none were disappointed. Note: Dijlah doesn't serve alcohol or offer byob, so fill up prior and you'll be fine ;-)  Here's where it gets tricky.  The service was almost non-existent. Our server was a very pleasant young man who did not seem to have it together. It took a solid 20+ minutes for our drinks, then our food came out very sporadically, with each person starting their meal many minutes apart.  When it came time for the check, he really struggled. To be honest, I have no idea what the problem was, but - there's no nice way to say it - this guy might want to reconsider this line of work. The restaurant wasn't busy and we did get out in under 2 hours, but for 5 people it could've been a more customer-friendly experience all around. Kudos to the manager (or owner?) who jumped in to help serve dessert and refill drinks. He was a delight.   My advice? Don't pass up this gem, but go for take-out instead."}
{"text":"This place is on my way to a lot of places, and after walking by it enough times, I decided to try it out. The decor is pretty, reminiscent of a hookah bar crossed with a Bed & Breakfast.  The menu looked promising, but the waitress informed me right away that they didn't actually have the first 2 items I was interested in (the Eggplant Sandwich would have been top pick).  I figured you can't go too wrong with a Chicken Shawarma wrap, so I decided on that. It was good, not amazing, but satisfying.  If I go back, it will probably be for the quaint yet funky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really great Iraqi food! Reasonably priced and very authentic. The appetizer platter was delightful. The hummus and tabbouleh salad were awesome! I highly recommend the tea and the kebobs."}
{"text":"This is place is great. One of my top middle eastern restaurants in the area and my has one of the top chicken shawarmas I have had in my life.   No lie.  And I'm from nyc where I've had some of the best halal food in the world.  Their chicken Saj shawarma is phenomenal. I could probably eat like 5 in one sitting. Their kabobs are always grilled very well, rice cooked perfectly, and their pita stretches to infinite and beyond.  The iraqi kabobs are also among my favorite. My buddy who is from Iraq suggested it because the food literally reminds him of his grandmothers cooking and he was 100!   Late night the hooka bar is open and a chill spot to just kick back, smoke and lounge.    Now I'm gonna go dream of shawarma."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 5 stars because of the iraqi kebab. This place has a nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food. Everything was very flavorful and fresh.   The menu is vegetarian friendly with lots of options to choose from. I picked the Dijlah Falafil Saj that was delicious, and shared the appetizer plate which featured Babba Gannoush, Tabbouleh, Hum mus, and Stuffed Grape Leaves. I also tasted the Lentil Soup, which was excellent.   There were 2 servers working at the time and they both checked in with us regularly.   The tea is very elegantly served.   Note that BYOB is not an option at Dijlah.   The portions were so generous we had no space left for dessert."}
{"text":"Shadiest Owner! He is a scam artist. My friends and I bought one of those restaurant.com $25off coupon (that's how we heard about this restaurant). We had to spend $50 in order to use it. We did, the bill came, and the owner tells us he is not signed up for this deal and doesn't accept the coupon. He said that restaurant.com signed him up AUTOMATICALLY, and he has no clue how to remove his listing from there. He said that he tried calling them and he spoke to his \"lawyer\". This man is a liar. He wants the money from the coupon AND what we spent in the restaurant. He is manipulative and deceitful. To top it off, the service was terrible. It was only him and then this young man who came in for his shift a bit later. It took 15 minutes to get waters. The one appetizer took about 20 minutes. No one checked on us to see if the food was good. There was no music either and we were alone in the resturant, this made the atmosphere eerie. Skip this place.Good luck with your restaurant, you fraud!  Check out this article about bad service at Dijlah: http://www.post-gazette.com/life/munch/2013/10/03/Munch-goes-to-Dijlah-in-Lawrenceville/stories/201310030202."}
{"text":"Excellent! We regular eat at Middle-Eastern restaurants in New York and are used to top quality, but Dijlah still managed to pleasantly surprise.  Super-friendly staff, also. Would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"I was in the Pittsburgh area for business and decided to grab a bite at Dijlah. I definitely recommend the falafel appetizer, it was very good and filling. I opted to try the mixed grill platter, it was good but nothing too special. I wouldn't recommend the tabbouli since mine was a bit dry. The decor of the main dining area was nice with different antiques and an Iraqi feel to the place, and the service was good.  I wanted to try their hookah as well but you can't smoke hookah in the main dining area so I had to move to the back area of the restaurant. It was a little smokey in there, I'd give the hookah 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Love their Iraqi kabab that is what we usually get when are there also their lentil soup is really good we also tried their fries which was also really nice and crispy I was told their burger is also good but never got to try it because whenever I wanted to order it they were always out of it"}
{"text":"I love this place. I recommend you to get Iraqi kabab. Then you can enjoy double apple hookah ."}
{"text":"Best ethnic food I've had in a long time! The lamb tika is extraordinary - the value for money I'd exceptional. They come highly recommended. :-) This is a must visit. Atmosphere is a bonus too..."}
{"text":"Excellent. Schwarma is excellent! Grape leaves, hummus and taboullah were also outstanding. Service was excellent. Meat is Halal."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the food here and I look forward to going back! My friend and I ordered a bunch of items and tried a little bit of everything.  Their hummus was SO GOOD. One of the best homemade hummus I've ever had! Very creamy and flavorful and I wanted to keep putting it on everything. It paired so well with their falafel. We both ordered meat wraps which were a combo of beef and lamb. One was cubed meat while the other had perfectly spiced kofte with ground meat. Both of them were so delicious, although I think the kofte was my favorite!   No bar and no BYOB here, but there is a hookah lounge in the back. Great place for a large group, as we saw many tables of families with huge family-style entrees of rice and kabobs."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really unique and communal feel that makes it somewhat like a lounge in addition to the restaurant. I'm sure the colorful pillowed benches along the walls have something to do with it, in addition to the hanging cloths on the ceiling (look up!). Far in the back, there seemed to be a karaoke area that is popular late at nights, though I didn't step foot in there. Judging by the number of people who were just around to eat or kick it around midnight on a Friday, it was obvious that this place was legit.   In terms of food, the portions are huge and everything is grilled perfectly. The pita is a tad crispy and the yellow rice actually had a nice savory taste to it. All the meats were tasty, but favorite was definitely the Iraqi kebab. Lots of spices and flavor,  all coming in three large skewers of meat. I was also a fan of the chicken and beef in the Dijlah sampler meal.  Lastly they have a nice list of different teas. Didn't order any this time, though we did get to try the Ahmed tea that came with a check-in. Very good, and just might get a full cup next time."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday for dinner and shisha after. Food was good, nothing extraordinary. We shared the small platter for appetizer which was tasty. I got the falafel wrap which was exactly what I expected.   We went in back for hookah after dinner, it was empty when we got there and they claimed they couldn't change the channel from wrestling on the tv. Shisha was good, staff was not attentive however. Once more people arrived they were able to change the channel (!) to a movie, but were also playing two different music channels on either side of me. This plus the lack of service (we waited so long for someone to come back in the room so we could get more coals but after waiting 15 mins we gave up) we decided to leave earlier than intended. If this place had more staff especially once it gets busier on a Saturday night it could be better."}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine. I have, though, tried Aladdin's Eatery.  I was impressed by the presentation of the food and the freshness of it. The salad had a familiar look but the taste was definitely not something I was ready for; a delicious blend of vinegar, oil and spices!  I had the falafel dinner which was very freshly and perfectly cooked.  Everyone's meal looked mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"I had no idea Iraqi food could be so delicious. This is a great place to order from. I've never eaten in (I like wine with dinner and this joint is halal, so booze is a no-no), but the take out is oh-so-tasty.  If grape leaves are your thing, get them here! They're moist and a tiny bit tangy.  Also, the Iraqi kebab is had at least once a week in my house- I have no idea how the meat is seasoned, but it's perfection.  The rice is generally better than the fries, if you can't decide between the two.  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"We recently wandered in here on a whim and were not disappointed! We split the appetizer platter that included hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, red tabouli, grape leaves and pita. Fantastic! My boyfriend had the Iraqi kabob while I enjoyed the shwarma plate. Bothe were wonderful. Great location close to home with delicious food and very affordable."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious.   Fresh squeezed juices: get one. The mint lemonade?! Yasssssssss.  I love this place because it's so consistent. Every time I go the food is great and the place is clean. I usually get the Iraqi kebob meal. So much food for a great price and it's cooked. Perfectly!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love their food ! Best grape leaves in state . However,  service is terrible . Honestly , blonde waiters has never got my order correctly . If you want to go there , be aware of that you might not want to dine in ."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and cheap! Try the combination appetizer platter, and mixed grill. The hookahs are also really good. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Dijlah is amazing. Great portions, healthy and delicious. You don't feel like crap after eating it. I got the Chicken Shawarma (it had very good seasoning) and the rice was very delicious. I also LOVED the Dijlah Cocktail. Also it is 100% halal. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. I will definitely be returning there."}
{"text":"Three colleagues and I ordered take-out lunch today from Dijlah, and were very happy we did.   We phoned in our order (GrubHub is also available) and the girl taking our order was polite and made sure she had our order right. We were happy to hear that our sandwiches could be part of a lunch special that included a side salad, so we didn't have to order extra salads to share, as we had planned on.  I went with the Iraqi kebab sandwich. It was absolutely  delicious, a perfectly cooked blend of beef and lamb in a wheat pita. Also inside were pickled onions (one of my favorite things on earth), tomatoes, parsley, and sumac. Herb, onion, and lamb flavors blended together perfectly, and the overall taste was hearty, but still fresh and bright. The wrap was also perfectly constructed: it didn't fall apart at all, and there was no annoying leakage. The accompanying side salad was larger than expected, with red cabbage, tomato, and parsley atop lettuce in a vinegar-based dressing. I love a mainly vinegar dressing, and the proportions of lettuce to topping to dressing were just right.  My co-workers ordered the vegetarian sampler, the chicken shawarma sandwich, and the falafel sandwich. They all were equally pleased with their lunches, with the hummus getting a special shout-out. We are looking forward to enjoying more great lunches from Dijlah!"}
{"text":"Four of us ate dinner here and the food was great and portions were large. We ordered a Combination Plate appetizer (hummus, babaganush, grape leaves, and tabuleh served with pita bread). It was enough for one person to have for a meal. It was the same for the Falafel appetizer that my wife ordered. It had four large falafel, salad and pita. I had the Iraqi Kebab and it was very good. My sister had the Shish Kebab (Tekka) and the beef was very tasty. I would return here again. Because it is halal, there is no alcohol."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great food and friendly.  I like the fact, that I don't have to fight through tourists to get great food in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A very cool Middle Eastern (Iraqi) place to eat if you've never tried Iraqi food before.   Honestly, I've been here a few too many times. It's decent food, but nothing to write home about. I prefer some spice and flavor with my food, and even though other people really love Dijlah, I find the food to be too bland, typically. If you put salt on the rice dishes, it works wonders, but there's not much flavor in most of the lamb, goat, and beef dishes. I'm also biased towards Indian food, which usually is packed with spices (not necessarily spicy, though...just ginger, garlic, turmeric, mustard seeds, etc...). To be honest, it's not that different from a lot of American restaurants in that it's easy food for your stomach, albeit a little bit oily.   It's halal, which helps! There's a hookah bar in the back and I've seen it reserved for parties and concerts. Overall, not a bad place, but I wouldn't go here unless my friends take me here. Still not quite a 2, because service is fairly good, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Went at 12 PM one Sunday, we were offered both breakfast and regular menus. Had some wonderful tea, lentil soup, falafel and meat wraps. Everything was fresh. Will definitely be back to try more stuff from the menu!"}
{"text":"Another late lunch with a friend.  We had no wait.  There is parking in the rear of the building on weekends but street parking on weekdays.  Comfortable atmosphere and seating.  Service was friendly, restaurant and bathrooms clean. We ordered the Dijlah Combination platter for 5.  OK, I know I said a friend and I and YES I know that is TWO but, we wanted leftovers.  I did not think that it would be as much food at it was.  Dijlah Plate is a mix of Iraqi meat & chicken Kabobs, Lamb & chicken Tikka, Kufta, Falafil, Chicken & Meat Shawarama, and Fries served with rice and salad.  Oh wait, we also ordered a side of Kubeh and a combo appetizer.  (I said we wanted leftovers) If you like the Middle Eastern flavors this place does them right.  The meats were tender, the falafil fluffy, the kabobs with a bit of char, a huge fresh salad, warm pitas and delicious dipping sauces.   You get a real decent amount of delicious food for the price...... and probably leftovers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic middle eastern food, this iraqi restaurant is excellent. I have been there a few times and tried a few different things on their menu.   Last time in there we had lentil soup, chicken kabobs, and lamb shank were very good. The lamb shank was incredibly tender and tasty.   I love that they have real bread, not that BS Americanized style of pita bread. We also had the babaganoush and hummus. I love the way they make their baba, I think it has a lot of Tahini mixed in with it.  Tried their baklava this last time too, loved it! Thin and tender.  All in all, a great place.for authentic middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Dijlah is a new edition to Butler St. and is still a work-in-progress. They have a hookah bar in the rear of the restaurant which is not approved for use as of this posting. Next, only 3 of the ~10 entrees were available for ordering that night despite the restaurant being nearly vacant showing some supply logistics still need to be improved. Lastly, the service is nearly inexistent. When we walked in, there was no host or employee to seat us. Once seated after several minutes of waiting, the person taking care of us was prompt to take our orders and serve the food but never returned to refill our drinks.  I think all of these problems are remediable and look forward to seeing a more mature Dijlah.  Now the food is certainly a bright spot. For appetizer, we split the Sigara Borek and Hummus. The borek is a fried thin dough pastry frilled with feta cheese or potatoes. I highly recommend the potato filled ones. The hummus had way to much tahini. If I wasn't one if those weirdos who like halva, then it would have been very unpleasant to eat the hummus. Our main courses were Chicken Shawarma and Iraqi Kebab. The chicken was lean but too dry for my liking. The kebab was fatty, greasy, and very well seasoned. It tasted like it was broiled rather than grilled. Regardless, I really liked the flavor and softness of the meat. I think the Iraqi kebab would be perfect as the meat of a burger.  All in all, Dijlah is a place I'd return to once it has a bit more experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The chicken kabobs were amazing. Lightly seasoned served with a big plate of rice and salad. Ask for extra yogurt on the side!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Kebabs and baba ganoush are not to be missed. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is always so I go to for a late night eats and quick bites. The service has always been top notch and the atmosphere is beautiful. The tables have one side against the wall and the other with just normal chairs. The seats against the wall ordained with pillows and beautiful fabric. There are hanging lanterns around the restaurant and fun music always playing. When you walk in the host will direct you to sit down and hand you menus. The menus aren't large or overwhelming but they have a lot to offer. The prices are also really good and you won't be paying a ton out of pocket if you eat here. I believe that they have lunch specials for the cheap but I'm not usually around for lunch so I cannot be sure. I do know they have a Groupon and the Living Social coupon so you can even buy one of those to save even more money. I usually like to get the chicken kabob and my partner likes to get the Iraqi kabob. Both come with three skewers of meat, a salad, saffron rice, pita, and some taziki sauce. It is more than enough food to have some for extra the next day. But sometimes it's so good that you end up eating all of it and being sad that you don't have anything for lunch. The service is always really nice. They know how to make you feel comfortable and welcome. In the food is out of this world. Really you should try it, and they're even open late. If you are in the Lawrenceville area I would really suggest coming here to enjoy some delicious food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Updated review of 4 stars: We thought we would give this restaurants another try. The Restaurant management reached out to me in a message on Yelp apologizing for mixing up our order with someone else's and refunded to our card. I ordered the same Iraqi kebab today, it was really good, just a tad bit on the salty side. My boyfriend liked the meat shawana wrap he ordered.     Previous review of 1 star: My boyfriend and I stopped in for some late night food since they were still open, however, they only had carry out at the time we came in which was after 1AM. We liked the atmosphere but we are very disappointed at the quality of food. We ordered the Iraqi Kebab, the food was ready in less than 5 minutes. When we got home, the food was cold and the sandwich was soggy, there were only a small portion of rice which seemed like left over rice. This was our first visit, which is not a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"Following the departure of Istanbul from Lawrenceville, another Middle-Eastern restaurant has taken its place, and has done so admirably as evidenced by a pre-gig meal here recently. Frustrated by their hours and days of operation as I was by its predecessor, I did my homework and persisted until I was reimbursed handsomely with a lush Arabic meal after being greeted by locked doors and darkened windows on several occasions.  An adorable cherub of an infant watched this bruising, black-clad, bald-headed heavy metal warrior/bon viviant intently as he noshed on Sigara Borek, mercilessly masticated some Shawarma, and regaled in a honeyed, flaky brick of Baklava underneath billowy ceiling curtains on a comfortable, vibrant couch.   The Sigara Borek consisted of a quaternion of deep-fried scrolls filled with feta, potato, and parsely. Within the brittle, ochroid pastry shell, the brackish feta and the starch would attempt to overthrow each other while the humble parsley balanced them out, acting as a Libra to a Leo and a Taurus in divorce court.   A \"Meat Shawarma\" sandwich made up my main course (shawarma can also be had as a platter). Swaddled in pita bread which in turn was wrapped in bakery tissue, the gyro of sorts was stuffed with shaved cuts of steeped beef tenderloin and complimented by onions, tomatoes, parsley, and sweet/sour pickles (!) with a tahini sauce I swore was tzatziki due to its creaminess served on the side. The meat, whatever concoction it was marinated in, was uncompromisingly ambrosial, and the sandwich itself was brilliantly layered. The toasted, the savory, the tangy, the buttery, and the mildly bitter presented themselves in pageantic fashion with every juicy chomp.   The baklava was as chewy, nutty, and sticky as a Snicker bar with an edible, paper casing, making it a primer on this kind of pastry. If only the helping had been a bit larger...  A green waitress made a valiant effort to provide good service, succeeding despite her inexperience with this manner of cuisine; no definite, deal-dropping snags were encountered as I was seated and served promptly.   With a reasonable and exotic bill of fare combined with lavish yet cozy surroundings, I see no genuine reason why Dijlah won't be yet another Lawrenceville smash. That is, if the people of LoLa give Dijlah a chance to charm them, and they most certainly should and will.   P.S. I peeked behind a curtain in the back while I was waiting for someone to vacate the men's restroom and noticed not only a hookah bar but a dancefloor (!) as well. It looks like another nighttime hotspot is in the making."}
{"text":"Why don't more people know about this place? Dijlah is amazing.   We had the lamb shank and the Iraqi kebab (opted for fries instead of rice). The lamb was incredibly tender and had the perfect amount of fat. The generous amount of rice that came with it was fantastically seasoned. We thought the portion of meat was going to be larger, but the quality more than made up for it. The Iraqi kebab was also a great choice and was prepared perfectly. I really wanted the fries because I'm in love with fries and they looked good from the photos on Yelp. They did not disappoint.   It was a spacious dining area with seats and colorful decor along the walls. There was something quite charming about the atmosphere. From the patterned pillows to the very visible ceiling plugs, we felt like we were eating in a friend's living room. (Even the bathroom felt very home-like.)  Boyfriend said this is the best food he's had in Pittsburgh. It was the best meal I've had since coming back after three months in NYC. Dijlah has replaced our go-to Middle Eastern restaurant. Cannot wait to be back!   Taste | 5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 3  OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"If you're looking for shawarma, this place is the spot! Make sure to get the garlic sauce that comes with it."}
{"text":"We stayed in Lawrenceville for five days and this was our most favorite meal during our stay. We enjoyed the combination platter (vegetarian), falafel, and lamb schwarma. Plenty of food for a party of three at a very reasonable cost of less than $25. Delicious flavors, good service and family friendly."}
{"text":"Amazingly tender meat. Delicious spices. Delectable flavor in every dish. Baklava was fantastic too. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff & owner. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Open late, great grape leaves, tender lamb, fresh salad. I was impressed, and it was nice to see how many people showed up after 7pm!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a new go to place for some delicious Mediterranean takeout! I've ordered from here twice and have been very impressed both times. The service has been friendly and they have the food ready really quickly for takeout (within 10 to 15 minutes).   The first time, I ordered the Iraqi kabob platter with rice and salad, and my boyfriend had the chicken shawarma platter. We also split some baba ganoush with pita. The portions were HUGE and the flavors were really good. I personally preferred the chicken shawarma, but both really delicious. The second time, I tried the chicken shawarma wrap, which came with a side of delicious crispy fries. This was such a steal! The wrap was huge and had their yummy garlic sauce in it, and they gave plenty of fries on the side.   I would definitely recommend this place for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Let us talk about the good part first: the food! They serve delicious, authentic middle eastern food cooked to perfection by people who really know what they're doing. I am from middle eastern decent and I have not been able to find something that even resembles authentic food until I found this place. Yummy! I had the Iraqi kebab, and the rest of my party had the shawarma wrap with fries and the mixed grill plate. We shared the hummus as an appetizer and it was so very tasty.   The bad part? Service. Our server was terrible. I know what it's like to work as a server and therefore I am very willing to look past some things, but the list of things got too long. First, getting greeted after waiting g for ten minutes (while seeing her on her phone in the kitchen area), being led to a dirty table (she gave it a quick wile while we were standing there), being served cups with lipstick stains on it (then having to wait another ten minutes for another cup), talking to us as if we're the biggest inconvenience in the world, waiting a very long time for the hummus appetizer, then for the food, then she had forgotten to ring in the wrap and instead of coming over to apologise she sent her co worker with the food she remembered, them came over with the wrap ten minutes later, THEN the fries that were supposed to come with ut ten minutes after that. On top of it all, it was an inconvenience to her (and she made sure we knew it) that we needed to split the one order off and pay it separately. No drink refills. No taste check. No pre bussing. No gratitude.   If the service was even half as good as the food it would get five stars but I cannot look past such poor treatment of restaurant guests."}
{"text":"Got my food to go. It was good. Fresh. Lamb was ground, not chunks but tasty. Sauce was good. Salad great. Rice ok. Will try more another time."}
{"text":"Kebabs and toubelah here are everything. Simply everything. The food is just intoxicatingly delicious. Always so  much food which is great because I love being able to have leftovers the second day. Also the fact that they're on Grubhub makes life so much better. Everyone there is super cool and friendly."}
{"text":"I had been in middle east for few yrs so i was looking for arabic food and found this restaurant through yelp so thought of giving a try and it didn't disappoint me ... I ordered mixed kebab plate that comes with rice and pita bred there was chicken beef and Iraqi kebab ( grounded beef)  and it tasted  good I asked for hummus to go with pita  bred had a yogurt drink at the end ... Overall good experience"}
{"text":"I wanted to bump up a star, since I've been back to eat-in and had an actual server (my first time there was a busboy filling in) and of course, the service was much improved! That hummus is still the BEST, and 4.99 for five BIG falafel balls, pita, and side salad? Best deal this side of the Allegheny."}
{"text":"I came here for the breakfast but didn't make it in time (it's from 8 -noon). We stayed and had lunch and boy was it good. We started off with the kibbie and it was good crunchy and not greasy with a great sauce. We had kebab trio and the lamb shank. The kebabs were great especially the Iraqi but the tender juicy lamb shank stole the show. Add in tender pita, rice and a nice salad it was enough for 4. We also had the Dijlah juice and that will bring me back. I'll review the breakfast when I get a chance."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Simple and wonderfully prepared so that you can taste the food without all the stuff most places use to cover up inferior meats etc. The rice was amazingly light and flavorful .I got the Iraqi kebabs and it came with rice and a tasty but simple salad that was amazing. Asked for the garlic sauce and it was sublime. It was my first venture there and it won't be my last. Also they carry some pretty amazing tea choices that I tried . Great service ,great food and a really cool setting."}
{"text":"Great food, I'm of middle eastern descent and I can tell you right now - this is authentic kebab! The spices were amazing. So flavorful and juicy - i got the Iraqi kebab (mix of ground beef and lamb). It came with rice and salad but i added a grilled tomato and onion. Oh also my friend and I shared the combination appetizer - hummus, baba ganoush, olives, tabbouli salad. The hummus and baba ganoush were to die for but the tabbouli salad could have used less parsley and more bulgar.   Arabic music played in the sitting area, and the furniture, although a bit outdated and cheesy was that of a typical authentic Mediterranean place, so in this case it was appreciated. Only reason i give 4 star instead of 5 is because the waitress took 15 minutes to even bring us water/take our order. Other than that - i would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I am so into this restaurant! I recently stopped by Dijlah with some friends because I was craving some Middle Eastern food and did not leave disappointed. I ordered the Iraqi kebab, which came with some fatty basmati rice (yum), salad, and pita slices. Man, this meal really hit the spot! The kebab, which was a combination of beef and lamb, was flavorful and zesty but not overwhelming or too greasy, which can happen with kebabs if you're not careful. One of my friends ordered the tabouli wrap which was the perfect marriage of its namesake, fries, hummus, and lettuce. I'm definitely coming back to get some more kebabs and babaganush, grape leaves, etc. Honestly, I might make an effort to try everything on the menu because the prices are pretty reasonable! My only complaint about Dijlah is that the atmosphere left something to be desired... There was no music or anything, so the restaurant was sometimes very quiet, which made me like only whispering was appropriate... But despite that nonsense, I'm a true fan! 10/10 would recommend."}
