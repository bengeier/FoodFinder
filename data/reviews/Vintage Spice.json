{"text":"As a Brit I've spent years trying to find a decent curry in Canada but to no avail. Until now!

I had the Dahi Balle which was new to me but so tasty. Surprisingly it was a cold appetizer which was weird to start with but my wife and I scraped it clean. 

Our two mains - chicken korma and xicuti chicken were excellent. Naan breads were nice and chewy. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Aurora has be longing for a good Indian restaurant for years and Vintage spice doesn't disappoint. The chicken tikka masala was delicious. Just the right spice. The other dishes we had were great too. They have a lot of selection. Service was excellent with owners and the chef asking if everything was ok and the decor adds to a great evening.  

This will be my local go to for my Indian fix and I look forward to seeing vintage spice thrive in our community"}
{"text":"Good food, at least what we ordered was well prepared and the atmosphere was relaxing.  I would go back to try some more of their dishes."}
{"text":"We went to Vintage Spice with our Indian friends who live in Aurora. The food was quite good... but we had to wait a lot of time for it. First it took 15 min just to get noticed and order. Then we waited for over half an hour to get our food. We had butter chicken, lamb, spinach paneer, samosas, mango salad, rice and garlic naan. Everything was quite tasty. Service was not super friendly, but maybe it's because we asked repeatedly where our meal is. So my suggestion is to go to this restaurant an hour before you are going to get hungry :)"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. I'm Indian, and this restaurant does not remotely come close to producing real Indian food. Wake up and stay woke."}
{"text":"Loved it. Very good!! Everything is fresh and made in house. I can't say enough how much I love this place. It's my new favourite local place. Will be back. 
Chicken biryani is very creatively served. Very tasty. The tandoori stuffed sandwich is also very good."}
{"text":"The worst place to go!!!!!!!.. warning  I went in to get chillies chicken around 12:15 at lunch time , when I ordered the food  the server was nice but upon receiving the order it was bad!!! So the server said we don't have rice at this time would u like nan bread instead, but then the cook cake out and said \" oh we have rice it will take about 15 minuets to cook\". I trusted the cook and said yes I will Waite 15 minuets. I waited 45 min for the rice to cook and on top of that the food was horrible.. the female server kept telling me to have a seat but I said it's ok I want to stand , she kept again asking me and I told her no I want to stand .. after receiving my food got to my work notice I had only 10 minuets left to eat .. I opened up the food and holly crap  it looked as if they cook d the meat and then placed it in with sweet peppers and lots of water.... I was sooooo mad  that the chilly chicken was shit!!!!! There was more water ( so called gravy) in my food then chicken ... the rice was as small as the palm of my hand ( which I waited for 45 minuets to cook) ... I was sooo mad  I threw the whole meal out and didn't even eat lunch .. I know what chillies chicken looks like and that was nothing like it... it looked like sweet and sour chicken was mixed in with water added for the \"gravy\".. I never ever go here again !!!!!!!!!!! Please be aware they don't even open their store when they say they do....waste of time and money !!!!!!!! BE AWARE"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I cannot day enough about the authenticity and brilliance of flavour you can experience here. It is by far our favourite restaurant to eat in or take out. The staff are thoughtful and pleasant, the cooks are talented, and the food is brilliant. If I could I'd give it 6/5 stars!
Thanks Vintage Spice, for the great experiences."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was very friendly and made good recommendations.  Dinner portion looked a little small, but I was satisfied in the end."}
{"text":"Newmarket/Aurora has been in dire need of a gourmet Indian restaurant. Vintage Spice may have answered that call. Newly opened just 2 weeks ago, their menu offers a wide variety of appetizers and mains. 
We tried the sweet corn soup and samosas for appetizers. Both appetizers were very satisfying, especially on a chilly Saturday night. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and really enjoyed it. My friends ordered two lamb dishes: the roganjosh and vindaloo. I tried the vindaloo and it was so good. Everything had a nice touch of heat, nothing too overpowering. We didn't have any room for dessert but did enjoy a proper masala chai - it was not any of that flavoured tea bag stuff and was made the way that chai should be. 
Given that they are a new restaurant, they are still ironing out the wrinkles - we did wait awhile for our mains but received several apologies from our server and another staff member. We were not in any rush so we were fine to wait (except that, despite having appetizers, we were still hungry).
As a group, we would frequent a good Indian restaurant about half an hour away in the north end of Toronto. I'm so glad this restaurant is open in Aurora - closer to home! I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Solid Indian cuisine with incredible flavours and great variety. I had a lunch meeting and this new restaurant was the suggestion--and a good one it was. 

I defaulted to a lunch special, the Lamb Roganjosh Thali, served on a big rectangular platter, because it needed it. This is an unusually big meal for a lunch special. All the flavours were bold, and it took me several orders of fresh naan to sop up every bit of the sauces. 

It's 7 hours after the meal and I'm still stuffed!"}
{"text":"The food was cold, bland and not authentic Indian cuisine. The rice was dry and somewhat hard. Nobody picked up the phone for a take away order despite my calling several times from 11am till 1230om. We definitely need good south Asian cuisine in this part of York region but this place is a disappointment"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Vindaloo and got served chicken in a bright red sauce, made of ketchup mixed with hot sauce!  The saffron rice was dry white rice with some 'yellow coloured' rice on top, the saffron taste wasn't there at all.  The naan and roti were stale and dry, and the service wasn't great either. Waste of time and money.  I don't recommend it at all!"}
{"text":"I made my first trip to Vintage Spice in Aurora. 

The food was very good.  The portions were very large, and the waitress was very helpful.

I have to eat gluten free, and was pointed to several options on the menu.  If you need to eat gluten free, be very specific in how sensitive you are, and if you have celiac disease.

I was told that they had a gluten free Roti.  I have not had a Roti in a very ling time.  After going through a long conversation, I found out that the Roti is not gluten free.  It is made from whole wheat flour.

The food that I had was very good, but I made sure that they knew how sensitive I am to gluten and went through the ingredients.

The lamb was top notch and well spiced.  The okra that I got was full of life and nicely spiced.

The lunch thali that my friend ordered was enough to feed 3 people.  Very generous sized meals and very fairly priced.

I will go back.  It was clean, sound levels were nice, and the waitress was very helpful."}
{"text":"Finally a great Indian restaurant in Aurora. The food is always amazing. I actually took some Indian friends of mine to judge the food and they gave it 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner on a sunday night.  We loved the way the restaurant is decorated and loved the character.

We enjoyed most of the dishes we had there.  We found that the vegetarian dishes were better than the chicken dishes we ordered.  We found the chicken slightly undercooked.  The papadum that they brought us out wasn't well cooked, it was a bit soggy and hard in some areas so it was under cooked.

There was a long wait for the food but I feel that isn't unexpected when going to an Asian restaurant.

There were a few miscommunications on the order they brought out large sizes of single glasses of wine when we wanted the standard size.  They also brought out rice which we explicity didn't order and charged us for it.  We didn't bother to pursue but it is something that I recommend making note of when you go there."}
{"text":"I was happy to see that there was a new Indian restaurant in town. 
I wasn't sure what to expect but we were very pleasantly surprised. The food was fabulous. Super tasty and my boyfriend who is new to Indian food loved it too. The service was good -a bit on the slow side but I think that was because everything was made so fresh. We loved that the chef came and delivered the food too. 
We would definitely recommend this place and will be returning soon. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Tranquil and charming restaurant in Aurora's quaint downtown, we were drawn to this spot by the alluring aroma wafting by.  And we enjoyed a satisfying Indian luncheon.  My colleagues ordered the lunch specials of various curried dishes; I opted for the lamb biryani lunch plate.  All dishes came beautifully presented - my colleagues' platters came not only with the selected curry and basmati rice, but also included papadum, naan, chutney, pickles, pakora, lentils, and a dessert (galub jamun)!  Quite a feast for 13 bucks (Canadian) or so!  My biryani was impressively presented in a metal bowl with a baked naan cover (to retain the steam and flavors during cooking as our server told me) which she deftly removed and folded for me to eat along with the rice.  It also came with a side of raita.  The dishes were fresh, tasty, and well-cooked.   A very pleasant and relaxing place for a meal."}
{"text":"Tonight we went to Vintage Spice in Aurora. In short, the best Indian food we've ever had! It's an extensive menu so we ordered a selection of dishes knowing we'd have enough leftovers for another meal. We started with chai, chili chicken and samosas... the chili chicken was amazing. For mains, we had two paneers along with bhartha (barbecued eggplant), lamb roganjosh and chili/cilantro naan. Everything we ate was rich and aromatic and it was obvious all the spices were freshly ground and mixed. Presentation was elegant and the staff were all very friendly. Total was $100 plus tip but, as I said earlier, we ordered a ton of food! We'll be back since I'm sure it won't matter what dishes we try next time, they'll all be good."}
{"text":"Not quite my taste. Seems like authentic Indian food. However, the dishes took a while to come out. The appetizer we got was a bit expensive for what it was.

Although, if you're looking for something that isn't pub food, or Italian, or Western brunch in Aurora, this is the place to go."}
