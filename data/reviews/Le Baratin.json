{"text":"I brought a coworker here for a business lunch, and we were both so impressed by the food and charming staff/atmosphere. We order two dishes to share; Croque Madame and the Beef Bourguignon sandwich and we couldn't decide which was more delicious. Just mouth-watering, and so authentic. I highly recommend this little gem. We will be back to try the dinner menu very soon!"}
{"text":"Two of us went in for dinner last weekend and we were seated right away without a reservation.  This was our first time there so our server guided us through the menu and gave us a couple recommendations.  The chef brought us out complimentary breads (an olive loaf and a tomato/mozzarella loaf), while we waited for a montagnard - which was amazing and a good size to share.   For our mains, we had the lamb shank and the steak frites.  The lamb was incredibly tender and SO GOOD.  The steak was cooked perfectly too and the shallot sauce makes it.   The entrees are very generous for the prices.   We shared the chocolate mouse for dessert and it was fantastic.     Overall, we had a great time.  Excellent food, fair prices, great service.  The place is cozy and upbeat and we'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I am going to chalk this disaster of a brunch to growing pains of a new restaurant. A bunch of friends and I went for brunch about a month ago.  First off, the coffee is dreadful. Food is a bit all over the place. Within our group, we ordered the Atlantic farçous, Le Baratin Ploughman, and the baked French toast. The farçous was dry, and the house-made gravlax portion was exceedingly pitiful (which might have been a blessing because it was salted to high hell). The ploughman portions were also on the skimpy side. The baked French toast was passable, good taste with lots of fruit, but again, would have liked to have more toast.   As summarized by one of my friends: just all around not great. On the plus side, their decor is quite quaint."}
{"text":"Lovely discovery in the neighbourhood! Went there for a bday dinner with my partner from France and he said the authentic, delicious (and very reasonably priced!) fare brought back lots of memories of home for him! Service was also friendly and fun, and we loved the casual ambiance of the place. The only room for improvement was the desert we had - the mousse wasn't as light as we'd like - but the mains were so good it more than made up for it! We'll certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the $45 Le Baratin Prestige menu that I found and booked on FastVenues.com/restaurants/le-baratin. My friend and I had our choice of two appetizers, a main and a dessert. I chose the blue cheese salad while my friend had the soup of the day. For our appetizers we made the easy decision to split the House Made Gravlax, one of my fav dishes of the city, and the charcuterie plate. Over all it was a great experience. I never used FastVenues.com before but my friend recommended I try it and if you get access to exclusive set menu meals at your favourite restaurants, I pre-paid and showed up with a voucher and enjoyed! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Charming little bistro with a sound menu, prepared with flair .. reasonably priced, including the wine list ... would I go back? An unqualified yes."}
{"text":"Discovered Le Baratin last fall while taking a walk on Dundas at lunch time. We ordered their atlantic farcous (like a frittata but better!) with spinach and goat cheese, homemade gravlax (delicious) top with an egg. Served with a salad. Everything was perfect. Went back recently, ordered the same as I enjoyed it so much and it did not disappoint. Yummy. Quaint little joint  to give a try. I might try something else off their menu next time I visit. Bravo et a la prochaine!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! A quaint French restaurant with house made shortbreads, cookies and croissants. I had the Atlantic Farçous (spinach pancake with house made Gravlax) and my bf the Lumberjack omelette. Both delicious and filling. The service was great and the atmosphere is very relaxed. We finished off our meal by sharing the Crème Caramel. We will definitely be back and are so glad we found this place. I give it 4.5 stars as the table smelled a little bit like a wet towel."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast. I had the lumberjack omelet which was very tasty. My daughter had the French toast with fresh fruit which was outstanding. Cinnamon and chocolate, how con you loose."}
{"text":"Lovely little place.  Ordered Sunday Prix fixe with fish. Good food overall. Our server was attentive.  The fish was salty for me."}
{"text":"Hidden gem amongst many brunch options in Little Portugal. Knowing my go to options would have a minimum 30 min wait I walked further west in the hopes of finding a new spot. Best decision ever! Stumbled upon this gem and scored a seat right away.  French dining at it's finest. Local hotspot; unpretentious and delicious french noms!  Prices are great given the quality of food and not your standard breakfast options.  Ordered the Duck Eggs Benny- succulent and packed with flavour! Even the side salad was prepared exceptionally well- dijon vinaigrette was spot on!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood restaurant.  Loves the duck confit and the tarte tatin. Excellent service by Meghan.  Unassuming but great value for the money!!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8.5/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10  A fantastic spot if you are looking for expertly prepared and authentically French cuisine. The place is small but that is part of its European charm, along with the wait staff who captive with their French accents.   A guaranteed delicious order would be the duck confit. It is succulent, tender and leaves you salivating for more.   Their extensive wine list is also another reason to come and enjoy.   One downer of the evening was a bit of a snooty attitude coming from our server. Nothing major enough to ruin the evening but is something that you remember as part of the experience.   THE BOTTOM LINE: a lovely, quaint, and authentically French restaurant worth your visit."}
{"text":"Everything was very good(although i would prefer the portions were bigger)  Tartine chicken and montral were so good, catalan omelette and bakedfrench toast were delicious. Staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Cool place, friendly staff , nice choice of amuse bouche,good main dish, very good deserts So... a  good experience  Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Been spending weekends walking around the neighbourhood...trying out all the restos in the area. When we first moved here it was a food desert...couldn't even get pizza delivered...the food options are very exciting now.  Le Baratin lives up to its reviews...a charming, intimate spot with great music and service...and the food is delicious!  We specifically came for the tartiflette...had it once before while traveling through France...it was a cold rainy day and we were comforted with this luscious bacon, potato and cheese tart...today's version was a vegetarian version of that...but to be honest this was just as good without the bacon.  Soup was delivered piping hot...everything is fresh and well seasoned.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while walking through DundasWestFest. We wanted to try a Portuguese or Brazilian place but settled for French since the menu looked good. Everything was great with the exception I found a bone in my sea bass."}
{"text":"Really lovely spot I discovered on the way home from work. Friendly wait staff and amazing food. I had the daily soup - a beet and lentil base that was flavourful and light. Second was the Beef bourguignon which was so tender, savoury and creamy. Delicious mashed potatoes too. I ordered the lamb shank to go for my partner who was working late. He loved it!  It's a French bistro with traditional menu items and an environment that is contemporary and hip.   I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed brunch here! It's a small place but we were able to get a table without waiting on a Sunday around 10:30.    It's a French bistro with many delicious-sounding omelettes, salads and sandwiches on the daytime menu. I had the croque madame and it was filled with eggy cheesy goodness. Would order again for sure. My friends had Montreal smoked meat tartines which I tried a bite of and they were also very good.   Although the portions were large we couldn't resist the cookies that were on the shelf next to us in cute glass jars. I had a peanut butter one that was ok. The shortbread cookies are better.   Good neighbourhood for after brunch wanderings...will be back!"}
{"text":"if your objective is good, uncomplicated, honest and utterly fair in price - well, Le Baratin gets an A+ on each.  Add in a cosy vibe, friendly staff and a charming location... perfect."}
{"text":"Great little place in the Dundas West Neighbourhood. Came here cuz it was close to my friends house. Pleasant surprise everything taste amazing and really reminded me of France. The chef is very nice and so was service. I came back another time, the food wasn't as perfect as the first time, maybe because the chef was not working that day. I will be back to try their Brunch Menu."}
{"text":"This is an excellent and completely authentic restaurant. Even the waitress comes from France. I have the feeling that the French owner is on site everyday which is always a good sign. The service is attentive and very well informed. The wine list is classic, classy and reasonable. (We had an outstanding 2015 Pouilly Fume).  We started with a lovely Frissee salad with apple and blue cheese and a rich mustard seed dressing: Great flavours and textures. The fish of the day was cod in a crispy crusting which again had wonderful flavours and good textures, accompanied by soft red peppers. We ended with the lamb shank which was beautifully spiced and herbed and tender, surrounded by fresh Romano beans in a rich brown sauce. The home-made fries came with a dusting of tarragon. All was delicious."}
{"text":"Le Baratin is a small, intimate, unassuming restaurant on the Dundas West strip.  It's in the part of the city that you think may be too far to go to with public transit, but boy would it be a mistake if you let transport get in the way of this amazing culinary experience!  Once you find the cute restaurant, you are greeted by cordial, intelligent hosts.  The menu is curated with French-Canadian classics along with some daily specials.  My boyfriend had one of their daily specials, a tourtiere with a bone marrow while I ordered the classic steak frites.  For the price that we paid, the portion sizes were amazing, and the taste and quality of the ingredients was a real show-stopper.  The flakiness of the crust on the tourtiere was buttery heaven.  The steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection and was complimented with crispy fries and a fresh salad.  Cannot recommend a better date night restaurant with such great service."}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a busy Friday night and it was excellent. Casual ambiance, great service, reasonably priced for what you get. Get the mushroom risotto. It's the best mushroom dish I've had in this city! (Beats Gusto's mushroom pasta)"}
{"text":"My friend and i came here for a wonderful french dinner last week, but i still remember everytjing perfectly. I had the duck, a very sizeable portion with a sublime wine sauce that complimented the duck perfectly and the roasted fingerling potatoes had a light, crisp skin perfect for absorbing the amazing sauce without becoming soggy.  The wine and food are a very reasonable price for the quality and I would definitely go here over any of the fancy restaurants on king street any day!  We were disappointed that they didn't serve mussels because apparently they are famous, but the server said it was usually on Tuesday and Thursday that they were available!"}
{"text":"Cozy brunch spot. I like the fact that they have fancier item like Egg Benedict with duck or salmon, omelet with different cheese, and also the traditional breakfast platter and some delicious soups and salads.    I had the duck benny which is delicious. I can't eat fries and the restaurant happily suggested they could substitute for more salad or a sweet potato soup. My friend got a pancake dish. I don't know how it tasted but I like that they even gi gooseberries and star fruits."}
{"text":"Small cute French restaurant. What stood out to us was the duck eggs Benedict . Definitely original and hollandaise sauce was delicious ! From the other pics, on help, seems like they cheated on the home fries a little. Atlantic French spinach pancakes were good but not to die for. Dessert was unique we got the tart tatin, we wanted to try it wasn't if you like apples and pastries then this is the dessert for you!"}
{"text":"What a delightful spot. Went their with my family. We all really enjoyed our meals. I don't eat dairy and they were very accommodating despite being a French restaurant. On the way out my son complained about us not getting him French fries. The owner brought him a full serving of fries in a to go up, no charge. Very sweet! Great food and atmosphere. Wonderful service"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, lighting, music, good service and delicious food is all I ever ask for when dining out with friends. Le Baratin brought all of these aspects together and made my eating experience a very remarkable one. I went with a large group of friends before the restaurant switched over to their dinner menu. They were very patient with us and allowed us lots of time to decide what to order. It was raining heavily outside and so aside from my group of friends and 2 other people, we were alone which was great!   The food was delicious! This was my first time trying french food in Toronto and it was great! I had a bite of my friends dishes and they tasted just as great as mine. I ordered the \"Baratin Ploughman\" which had many different components on the plate which satisfies how I personally like to eat. My friends ordered the \"Baked French Toast\" which was absolutely heavenly. One friend hates whipped cream however, the cream that Le Baratin presented was one that she absolutely loved. The \"Tartiflette\" looked like a cheese lover's paradise, so I would order that if you love overflowing cheesy goodness! The \"Lumberjack Omelette\" was so delicious that my friend finished his dish faster than all of us. Lastly, if you are a fan of tuna, I would recommend the \"Tartines, tuna twist\" that looked really good too.   I will certainly be coming back again because this experience was magnifique!"}
{"text":"To be honest I am kind of a hard person to please when it comes to food, so rarely I give out 5 star reviews. But Le Baratin has impressed me so much that I feel obligated to give it the best it deserves. we came here for brunch on a Sunday, and ordered the Baratin plowman and Spinach pancakes with smoked meat. The portions were massive (especially for a French restaurant), and prices were very reasonable! I think that's the restaurant's aim - to serve delicious high quality food at reasonable prices, taking the pretentiousness out of French cuisine which people have come to associate it with. I am a practical person and I love that! They have a different menu for dinner which looks equally as good, I will sure to return to try it out."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for breakfast and adored the place. I had the Coque Madame and it was fabulous. My husband tried the spinach pancakes-a very different kind of dish for him and he loved them. Kudos also go to the fresh garden salad and potato salad sides.  Waiter/owner was very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for saturday brunch with the boyfriend and had probably the best french toast I've ever experienced. The insides had a bread pudding-like consistency, while the outside was crispy and caramelized. It was served with some fruit as well as a side of whipped cream with a hint of lavender. For a breakfast/dessert, it wasn't too sweet.   Also ordered the ducky eggs benny, which had many layers of flavour - from the hollaindaise, the spices and the duck. It also came with a salad that had mustard seed dressing, also a level up from what you'd expect of a side salad. The eggs were neatly poached, the bread wasn't soggy, and this was also one of the best eggs bennys I've ever had. The potatoes were also really good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Ended the meal with the tarte tatin, which was warm and provided a very hearty and comforting end to the meal.   The servers were also very friendly and you could hear them speak french in the back. There were also Adventures of Tintin books displayed on the walls as well as some quirky art and french quotes. A very authentic feel and I'm so glad to have found one of my favourite brunch places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Visited Le Baratin for dinner on a casual weekday, and ordered quite a bit of food off of the menu for two people.  The vibe and ambiance is quite casual, and reminded me of the some of the great French bistros that I ate at in Paris. We were greeted immediately and given a few minutes to peruse the drink and food menus.  For drinks, we ordered a Sidecar off of the cocktail menu, and the gracious server offered to make an elderflower gimlet for my girlfriend. I also ordered a French Connection later in the meal. The drinks were well made, nicely balanced, and had a good amount of booze.  As for food, we started with the baked tomato torte (tarte provençale) and roasted beetroot salad (mange de la betterave), which offered a great contrast of hot and cold. I loved the baked tomato torte, and the beetroot salad was a very refreshing way to start the meal.   For mains, we ordered the braised lamb shank (souris d'agneau grand-mère), crispy pork belly, and duck leg confit (confit du canard). All three mains were delicious, with my favourite going to the braised lamb shank for being tender and delicious. My only reservation is the amount of carbs that were included, which was a significant amount of potatoes for each dish, but we also ordered three mains so it's somewhat a given that we'd be stuffed.  We made room for dessert, of course, and we ordered the creme caramel and tarte tatin. Both were incredibly delicious, and a great way to end our meal. The tarte tatin, in particular, was an absolute treat to eat.  Overall, our meal at Le Baratin was fantastic. The drinks were well made and a really great price for cocktails in downtown Toronto, and the food was delicious, providing a great take on French comfort food. I'd love to come back, especially if they add or change their menu, but Le Baratin is a great little place for a delicious night out."}
{"text":"authentic French food in a lovely setting...reasonable prices in a city where fantastic food often comes with outlandish bills. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for my first visit since the transformation from its former operating name of Bivy, and came for the brunch which menu actually seems more familiar than the changes that were made to their dinner menu.  I had the Beef Brisket Eggs Benedict, and will say I enjoyed them and admittedly was impressed in the portion size. In addition to the standard english muffin halved and stacked with a poach egg amd the aforementioned beef brisket, there was also a side of some super tasty potato wedge type home fries and a house salad. My usual experience with french cooking typically involves smaller portions, so to receive an actual brunch worthy portion that left me filled up and actually tasted good? Well I was pleased to say the least. My date had the Vegetarian French Spinach Pancake, which reminded me more of a crust-less spinach filled quiche. Not really up my alley but they enjoyed it, so all in all a pleasant brunch experience.   Since the place serves as sort of a cafe vibe during the day, they also have takeaway cookies and baked goods available. We grabbed a few things (banana bread slice @ $2.50, cookies @ $2 each, shortbread 3 for $2) and this is the only thing that really was a let down at all. By this point we had a nice breakfast so our dine in experience was good, but later in the day when munching on these various bake goods at home we noticed how disappointing they were. Cookies super dry, banana bread lacking in banana flavour, and coconut shortbread being devoid of coconut. Morale of the story? Order food from the kitchen made to order. Not the pre-baked offerings in the cookie jars or display cases."}
{"text":"Four of us dined at Le Baratin on Sept. 2nd. P and I agreed that he would order the  Confit de Canard and I ordered the Braised Lamb Shank ... and we would switch plates midway. Meanwhile C ordered Risoto Chamignons and J ordered Tarttiflette. I tried each and both were excellent. Of the lot, I liked the canard the best. The sauce was exceptional. I savored every bite. Hats off to the owner and staff.  We ordered two bottles of wine. First, the Cahors Chateau Eugenie (100% malbec) and second, the Chateau Caminade Ht. Guerin (a blend with malbec). As expected, the 100% malbec is very different than Argentine mablec. Of the two wines, we all favored the second bottle.   Ambiance: 4 stars  Service: 5 stars Cuisine: 6 stars (see note 1)  We visited Toronto for 4 days and we all agreed that Le Baratin was the best dining experience of our trip. We would return in a heartbeat.  Note 1: This tricky ranking was necessary in order for the ratings to add up to 5 stars that Le Baratin deserves.  ;)"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 with a reservation on a Friday night and the place was filled. For large parties you have to pick from a prix menu, we had 3 options of an app, entree and dessert to choose from and everyone can get a different option.   I started with a salad, simple but fine. For the entree I got a seafood stew and wow! it was amazing! it was a mix of fish, mussels, some clams and shrimp a good mix and portion of seafood and topped with dried slivers of green onions. The fish was a little overcooked though but the broth was amazing! it was creamy and buttery, really savory and satisfying. It was actually also very filling.   For dessert I got the upside down apple tart - the apples were deeply caramelized with lots of chewy bits and extremely extremely sweet but so delicious. The pastry at the bottom was a bit chewy, but it comes really warm and the portion is huge! Plenty to split between two people if not for the prix fix. I was so full by the end I couldn't finish the tart and I had to roll myself out  With a glass of wine the total came to be about $50. However when billing it seems they have charged us more than expected and we couldn't figure out for what. Some people ended up paying $70-80 which left a sour taste in our mouths after a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great food, really enjoyed the streak frites and the Tarte Provencale was fricking delicious! Great servers, no complaints. Will be back"}
{"text":"Having lived in NYC previously, we were quite spoilt for brunch options (Cafe Orlin). This is probably the best and most flavorful brunch place in Toronto. Eggs benny/ scrambled with salmon/ duck confit and the French toast are simply excellent. The cappuccino was very good too. Portion sizes are just right and the service is friendly. Full five stars!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with La Baratin. We went for brunch and I had the Atlantic Salmon Spanish pancakes and my partner had the croque madame. They were spectacular: extremely flavourful and good portions - you can also tell that the ingredients are of high quality. The service is great too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was in the area for an event across the street. Stop in for a bite to eat. Ordered the lamb shank with mash potatos. It was perfect."}
{"text":"Cozy French bistro with very good food. We ordered the foie gras appetizer which came with a delicious onion preserve. For mains, we ordered the duck confit and lamb shank which were both delicious. I am partial to the duck for it's crispy and fatty skin which added a depth of flavour I enjoyed. I also ordered a side of French fries that came in a large bowl. They were good, but a bit average tasting. Service was good and it felt casual like a local neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Le Baratin is a very good option for a pleasant French meal.  I found my meal and service to be very good with some room for improvement in both areas.  The great delight and surprise was a $24 Sunday night prix fixe that included a choice of soup or salad, a main, and a chocolate truffle at the end of the meal.  The mushroom soup was good, yet could have had a bit more of a creamy texture. For my main I had steak frites. The sauce on the steak was excellent, as were the frites. The steak was good, and could have been better. The plate came with a small salad as well.  The chocolate truffle for dessert was delicious.  Cocktails were boozy, yet well-made. The wine list featured very reasonably-priced wines.  Service was good, yet you could feel the hectic pace. Small things like removing a plate from the table before both guests are finished, etc. were noticeable, yet not deal-breakers.  I really enjoyed the meal. I wish they would charge $29 and offer a more complete dessert, yet no complaints with a 24$ prix fixe."}
{"text":"Le Baratin locates at Dundas west, a lot of parking in neighbourhood street.  I went there for dinner on Tuesday.  Restaurant was pretty empty, we didn't make reservation ahead of the time.     I ordered confit ($22, duck leg with roasted potatoes and a green peppercorn wine sauce), and my friend ordered steak & frites ($21, marinated flank steak served in a shallot & peppercorn sauce, with frites & mixed greens).  Confit is well done, has a lot of flavours crispy skin and tender inside. However, it is a bit salty. I've had duck confit in a number of French restaurants in Toronto. This seems like a constant theme... If anyone knows any restaurant has less salty duck confit please let me know.  My friend also likes her dish. But I wouldn't say it's mind-blowing.  Will come back to try their brunch menu."}
{"text":"We went to Le Baratin for our second visit this past Sunday.  Our dinner was equally as excellent as our first visit.  Wonderful authentic French cuisine, and very reasonably priced, even the wine. The duck confit,  and the steak frites are entrées that I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time eating here and was very impressed all around. The food was excellent in taste and in portion size. I tried the spinach pancakes with a cured salmon and my husband tried the breakfast sandwich. The breakfast sandwich bun was soft and had the perfect consistency. The potato salad was on the creamy side, but very yummy. The side salad had a bit too much dressing but again, the taste was great. I believe they sell the salad dressing as well. Their Americano was great and they even gave us a refill. They allowed us to linger and get some work done which we appreciated a lot. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try Le Baratin for a while - I'd enjoyed its previous incarnation, Bivy - and the Valentine's Day four-course dinner seemed like as good an opportunity as any.  We arrived a few minutes late for our 8:30 reservation and were shown to a table at the rear of the restaurant. Just as we got back there, though, the couple in front of us requested the table that we were supposed to get and we got theirs. Our new table was a small thing designed for people to sit side by side (gee, I wonder why that other couple didn't want this one?), which didn't remotely work for me so we used one of the provided chairs to reconfigure the layout and I had to sit at an uncomfortable angle all night.  Not the best start to the meal.  I ate:  Quenelle de St. Pierre à la crème de homard (\"John Dory quenelle with lobster cream sauce\"): This dish, which was provided at room temperature, was tasty yet far from mind-blowing. The cream sauce tasted like a lobster cream soup, essentially, while the quenelle was a fairly tasteless mound of whipped fish. There was nothing bad about this, but it was definitely not the superb starter I was hoping for.  Coulibiac de saumon aux poireaux (\"Salmon& leeks in a puff pastry pie\"): Again, a competent but underwhelming dish. Interestingly, the puff pastry itself was the best part of this concoction, as it was super flaky and buttery. The filling was just so-so and honestly tasted mostly of salmon. A little uninspired, to say the least.  Epaule d'agneaux confite, jus aux herbes, gratin de topinambour (\"Lamb shoulder confit, herbs juice, Jerusalem artichoke gratin\"): This was undoubtedly the highlight of the meal. The lamb shoulder was almost astonishingly tender and flavorful, while the artichoke gratin was cheesy and delicious and addictive. I could've eaten this dish all night.  Mad chocolate cake: This was a very rich chocolate cake, nothing more and nothing less. It was an exceedingly heavy end to a hit-and-miss meal.  I should note also that I would've ordered a second cocktail had I been offered the opportunity, but our waiter seemed completely overwhelmed by the packed-house ambiance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a 10 minute walk from where I live and I have been here for dinner and brunch. I have been here only a few times but I am always so satisfied with my experience every time! The service is great, the food is excellent and it's just an overall great place that I hope sticks around the neighbourhood for a long time! I recommend the steak frites as that meal is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Fancy french food that delivers in quality, with a quaint little restaurant, without the fancy prices. The gentleman who serves as both host, server and bartender is also equipped with a full french accent (and I'm sure the full language capabilities).   We ordered the sourdough (this was the biggest rip off with a couple of small pieces of bread), the assiette pour discuter (this was nice and came with the homemade sourdough and homemade boursin! along with other delicious things). The seafood stew that was on special was AMAZING, broth was super flavourful and there was lots of seafood. The steak frittes was delicious with yummy fries, the lamb shank was great with delicious garlic mash, and the special sardines on salad were also great!   The cocktails were delicious and unique, I'd recommend trying any one! I will definitely be back when I want to go nicer without breaking the bank!   Almost forgot, the desserts are delicious! Order the upside down apple pie, it will not disappoint with apples that are still crisp, a nice crust and fresh lavender whipped cream...delicious! For chocolate lovers, the chocolate mouse is very nice too!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Not too pricey. I got an omelette, that came with fresh greens and tasty portion of potato salad. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Was great from the beginning to the end. The food was perfect,the atmosphere very cool and the price were very reasonable. Try the Tarte tatin if you are gourmand. We will definetely go back."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal on a Thursday night. Was busy but not overrun with customers. As such, nice vibe. Service was attentive but not over-bearing. Noise level which seems to matter to me more and more, was comfortable. We could hear each other talk without straining. Very European.   Sardines on housemade potato salad starter was excellent. Both mains were satisfying. Duck confit in particular.  Nice selection of wine.   Looking forward to going back to the the Sunday night prix fix."}
{"text":"This place was lovely and the service was too! The chef even made delicious mussels without cream to accommodate my preference (and just to be kind). They were so excellent that I felt I must write a review. Well done and I wish you much success, Le Baratin!"}
{"text":"We love the staff, food, ambience. This is often our go-to lunch spot but theSunday night prix fixe is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I just found a new French restaurant that I can frequent often without breaking the bank! Delicious & authentic (with a modern twist) french food, no pretentious service nor lavish menus.I would love to come back here again and again!   -Mange de la betterave (roasted beet salad) - $8 The roasted beetroot had this wonderful earthy and sweet taste to it. With every bites, you are getting a subtle crunch and hint of sharpness from the beet chips. The pickled red onion with cumin gave the salad a nice \"pick me up\" while the goat cheese added some tanginess.  -Tarte Provencale - $9 The first bite of the tarte greets you with a crisp, crumbly crust that is buttery and the juicy tomatoes provided a nice brightness and acidic accent. The goat cheese brought a creamy and salty elements to the tarte. The overall dish were sweet yet savory with the flavorful infusion of (I believe) rosemary and thyme.   -La Ratatouille - $12 For a vegetarian dish, the ratatouille was incredibly flavorful with the vegetables had softened to the perfect consistency, becoming one dish while still maintaining their individual flavors. I loved the smokiness from the eggplant which contrasted with the sweetness from the red peppers, topped it all off with parmigiano that provided a strong & sharp flavor to the dish.  -Souris D'Agneau Grand-Mere (braised lamb shank) - $21 The trio of flavor of white kidney beans, lamb and rosemary is indisputable. The lamb shank was incredibly tender, fell off the bone goodness. The hearty confit tomato kidney beans and rich red wine sauce added another level of heartiness to the dish.   -Tarte Tatin - $6 The golden pastry crust was perfectly crispy, layered with soft apples bathed in caramel and their own sweet juices. The tarte was then topped with an airy puff of whipped creme, which I swear was infused with a tea flavor that was not overly sweetened."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch.  Intimate atmosphere amazing brunch. Service was great.  Food was delicious. Croque Monsieur or madam are amazing and spinach pancakes are delicious. One of the best brunches I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Found this hidden gem through a friend. There's no drip coffees but the lattes are great."}
{"text":"Love the French classic dishes they have and they serve breakfast till 5pm which is awesome! Place is cute and charming."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem.  A chill atmosphere, no wait kind of place with some of the friendliest staff on the planet.   We've inadvertently brought our family and friends here so much (because we always want to keep coming back) that we have to remind ourselves that they might want to try other restaurants.  The croque monsieur is enough to keep us coming back but the french toast, spinach pancakes (and basically everything else) is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Amazing. If you're looking to impress within a fair price and delicious food. This is the spot. I loved their set menu on weekends. But their weekday meals are fine too. I have to admit. Their lamb shank and tar tartin was my goto selections. But if they have the option of the escargot. You must make it a trio.  Cheers y'all"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the meal here.  Great service by Schuyler. Started with creamy and rich escargot and mushrooms. My mussels with pesto were clean and wonderfully flavored with a variety of herbs.  The tarte tatin was sweet and went well with vanilla ice cream. Try the cocktails too.  Mine had hinder beer.  Price is very reasonable for quality of food.  Too bad I'm from NYC- not an easy trip here to Toronto!"}
{"text":"My new found hidden gem... I hate to tell everyone else because I want to keep my table here but it's too good to not share!  If you love great food and so well priced without pretentious service, this is the place to be.  I came here for brunch and blown away at the flavours.  This is a place to enjoy a good coffee and a wonderful meal with friends in a rustic and warm atmosphere.  The location is a bit out of the ways and the only signage is on the window but it's not too hard to find.  It is a smaller restaurant... maybe only 20 tables at most and the environment has that quaint and rustic charm.  I love how they sell their sauces in their Epicerie off to the side... they even have their own espresso blend!  You know you're in for a good meal when they even pay attention to the coffee.  Service here is a touch relaxed but still personable.  Think of France where you linger over a great meal and conversation as you indulge in a great coffee on a beautiful Sunday.  There are two partners for Le Baratin and it is the chef and the front house manager.  The lovely manager was interacting with everyone and serving food.     Atlantic Farcous - So we ordered the Atlantic Farcous (a wonderful and incredibly flavourful gluten free vegetable 'pancake' with in house made salmon gravlax) with a wonderful side salad and some crispy potatoes.  5/5  Croissant French Toast - We also got the BEST FRENCH TOAST... yes its needs the all caps!  they used croissants and cream to create the most wonderful custardy interior and then they sear the outside to a wonderful caramelized crisp.  Honestly, it is so decadent and I rarely use that word.  It has the best flavour and texture I've had in Toronto.  5+/5   Apple Tarte Tatin - We decided to end our brunch with the apple tarte tatin which was wonderful.  Buttery caramel enveloping the apples and soaking into the flakey buttery pastry base.  Just a wonderful! 5/5  The best part of this... this is all at French Bistro prices.  You get wonderfully made food and it will not make you feel like you just spent too much.  All you will feel is a happy smile on our face from eating a delicious meal."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner. Our meals were delicious, the staff were personable and attentive, and the ambience was relaxed. I'll come here again."}
{"text":"I had an hour in between meetings and needed dinner. I found Le  Baratin on a Google map near my next activity, so I decided to book a table and try it out. The menu has a number of French cafe standards as well as three specials of the day: appetizer, catch and carnivore/meat I had the appetizer of the day - smoked salmon ravioli in a lobster sauce. I then ordered the carnivore of the day special- a beef cheek bourguignon.  I then looked at the dessert menu even though I didn't need dessert...the days offer was a pear/marzipan tart that was delicious.  Good portions and well crafted food."}
{"text":"Also known as Bivy Coffee which is what I had came in for--busy brunch/lunch location.  There was a lineup at the back for coffee and people were dining.  I've been here for brunch and it is delicious!    Their French spinach pancakes are delicious!  It's definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"A French dinner-date spot near Dundas and Dufferin area that serves superb French cuisine. We often come here for a special dinner. They have steak frites plus a small side salad that is heavenly, sweet and savoury. They also have a lamb shank as a main, I ordered this before and it was mouth-wateringly delicious. After our 2017 Thanksgiving whirlwind trip to Paris, we fell in love with French cuisine and this place --in combination with Jules' Bistro on Spadina and Richmond -- are fabulous. Le Baratin is quaint and it seats maybe around 20-30 people, people from all age brackets. There's also bar seating, I think, and washrooms are downstairs. If you love French food, this place is a resounding YES!! We probably can't afford to eat here everyday, but it's definitely a nice treat."}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...  \"In France, the greatest bistros are magnetic because they produce consistent food, and Le Baratin is no exception. But above and beyond the food, the service was worthy of at least one Michelin star. Our French-accented server was the definition of lovely. She was engaged, and provided a curated list of her favourite spots for my upcoming trip to France.  L'assiette de charcuterie ($18) was the perfect way to start our meal. The savory spread of duck rillettes, pâté, proscuitto and salami was made for sharing. The duck rillettes were a highlight, and it was evident that the duck legs had prepared in a traditional way: dry-brined and braised in aromatic stock, then finely shredded and mixed with duck fat. It was a gourmet combination with the baguette.\""}
{"text":"Delicious French food! I ordered their French pancakes with salmon that they make in house and it was very tasty. I believe that special care is placed into creating the dishes, which includes paying special attention to flavors and herbs and spices and textures and balance. Also, the service was great! The place felt very homey and I felt like I was visiting a \"go to\" place in someone's village.  The only thing I wish this place had was an accessible washroom. Having a physical disability, there is no way I can make those stairs! Although, I do think that this place is worth visiting again despite the lack of accessible bathroom. I hope that by 2025 this restaurant becomes fully accessible. See : \"The path to 2025: Ontario's Accessibility Action Plan.\"  And great coffee by the way!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. I called and asked if they had room for three and they said yes, if we get there soon. Well we arrived 5 minutes later and were told the only room was at the bar in the window, they had seated someone else at the table.  They said once someone left we could have a table. Well people left and other people were sat before they offered for us to move.   Service was very inattentive and slow. Seemed like they could care less if we were there. The food was average, had the Croque Madame (which took about 30 minutes to make) which was fine but wouldn't have it again.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"The management of the restaurant is bad, me and my friend came for a dinner at 4:30 pm and they said they won't serve food for 40-50 minutes because of the change in service, this is not professional at all , so we left. We didn't try any food , but for me it was enough to base my review on that . I might give it a try , but for now it is just 1 out of 5 for management and organization."}
