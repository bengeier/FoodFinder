{"text":"it's run-of-the-mill. 

I ordered the jalapeno poppers. Wouldn't recommend them. Having lived in San Diego for almost a decade and having experienced the authentic Mexican, Tex/Mex etc. cuisine I was astonished to find that they pass red peppers off as jalapeno peppers for their poppers. 

If you like microwaved food...go for it. Not my thing. 

My brother ordered the ribs and they were delicious. I should've gotten those or tried the Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"It was just ok...nothing to write home at all.  We got seated very quickly on a Sunday night.  We sat outside in their patio section that was very nice.  However, after that is where things started going downhill.  We had to wait almost 10 minutes for our drink order to be taken...several of the wait staff walked by and never even acknowledged us even though we tried to get their attention.  After a waitress finally came over we finally placed our entire order in fear of having to wait even long.  It then took another 10 minutes for our drinks to come.   The food arrived about 20 minutes later and was average at best.  There are much better places for food, price and atmosphere in my opinion.  This place seems to be trying to be a winking lizard and just not cutting it."}
{"text":"Worked her a few years ago as a waitress not sure if they have gotten new owners since then. Anyways I quit working here only after a few weeks because I was so disgusted with the kitchen. I was told to serve rolls to customers that were in a bag filled with old moldy rolls and I had to pick out the rolls that didn't have mold on them yet. No joke I was told by my manager to serve old food. I had heard other waiters who worked at Tony's bad mouth the kitchen before but I had to experience it myself. After a while I had to quit because I was not going to be held responsible for a customer getting sick because of an assho le boss who forced my to serve old food to customers. I would never and will never eat there after seeing that kitchen and knowing that their management only cares about their money and not the customers health well being."}
{"text":"This is the best place to grab a bite or a beer in Berea. Patio is amazing, staff is on the mark. You will love this place !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very clen with lots of TVs for watching the games. Heated outdoor patio that can be used in the winter. By far one of the better places to eat in Berea."}
{"text":"It was, edible. We both tried from the Mediterranean options. The steak was grey. As if it sat in marinade for the last week until someone (me) ordered it. We MIGHT come back to try the fish fry because a picture looked good and the patio was so nice to relax and have a couple beers to live music that was enjoyable to listen to over dinner."}
{"text":"I heart the Mediterranean sampler here at Tony's. Nothing tickles my fancy more than sharing the sampler with a loved one. They have a special Mediterranean menu as well as their regular menu. Every time I have eaten here I go home happy and stuffed like a turkey. The grape leaves, chicken/steak kabobs, hummus, tabbouleh, and rice are all delicious. The food is all very reasonably priced and they have some great specials throughout the week. Service is very fast and friendly. To be honest they just do it for me and I just keep going back every time I'm in town! 
Tony's has a variety of seating available, they have a dining room, sports bar, and outdoor seating in the warmer months. They do accommodate groups so its perfect if your meeting a bunch of people out for a few drinks and some grub. They have a ton of TVs to watch sports and they also have electronic trivia on some of the TVs. Overall this place is a great relaxing place to enjoy with friends and family."}
{"text":"Visited this place for a baby shower. Big place, nice size patio area. Service was good. I had the Italian wedding soup, it was tasty.  It had a lot of vegetables and meatballs.  I also had the Pecan crusted chicken salad. That was nice size and tasty also. I'll have to come back and bring hubby. So far, so good."}
{"text":"Lisa was our server the other day for lunch and she was wonderful. I would come back just to see her. Food was great. I had the bbq sandwich and would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks here. Always good. Really enjoy their ribs and steaks. I recommend trying this place as you won't be disappointed. They have Keno here and an outside patio too."}
{"text":"Lots of big screens tv' s & large selection of beers. Found my son's favorite Yenling!!  Was there for a party.  It was very loud in the restaurant & party room which made it difficult to hold a conversation.  Food was mediocre to say the least.  Had buffer that included , pizza, chicken fingers, salad, fresh veggies and sandwhich rings.  The fresh veggies were the only thing I liked! The customer service was great as my daughter is on a special diet & couldn't eat from the buffet.  Within 10 minutes she had an alternative meal!  Kudos for great customer service!  Loved the outside patio with beautiful glass tiki lights that added a nice ambience!"}
{"text":"We have been going to here for Mothers Day for many years. This year the food was horrible.... way over priced for quality of food. Everything was dry and no flavor. We won't be going next year."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, Server @ the bar was super nice, attentive.  Saw that wing's were on special, had a taste for them, got the dry rub bone in.  They were so small.  Wonder if they are always that small?  Don't think I would order them again."}
{"text":"This is what I would call a 50/50 restaurant. Half of the time is good and half is....well subpar. I have eaten here at least 12 times since I moved to Berea back in 2003. I am never blown away, but my disappointment level is typically kept minimal. I would recommend sitting in the bar section, the atmosphere is MUCH better. If you do get stuck in the restaurant part...sorry. The restaurant portion of this place has a kids table feel. You can kinda see the bar portion (adults table) of the from there; and kinda feel like you are missing out on something. All in all this joint is OK, the food is ok, the beer is always cold and the services is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Brought my family here for dinner, there were 5 of us.  They seem to me to be more of what I would expect under the name Restaurant, than a \"bar and grill\".  Everything was clean and well kept.... they have a covered outdoor area  and an uncovered area as well.  Plenty of TV's both internal and external. 

They have pretty good stinking specials.  We got a few orders of wings (4.99) and it was burger special night ( 3.99 burger and fries) and a few beers... total for my family was about $65... not too bad. 

The mild wings we ordered were really good.  The burger/fry places were smaller than some, but still everyone filled up, and we were good to go. 

Over all it was A-OK, I've have better and I've had worse...  but would not object to coming out here again."}
{"text":"Very poor dinner. 3 medium rare steaks ordered 3 tastless medium steaks received. I don't need to go back"}
{"text":"Tony K's is a large sports bar located in a more industrial area of Berea.  If you weren't driving by it, you probably wouldn't know it exists.

There are 3 large sections to this place, the restaurant side, the sports bar, and the beautiful patio.  Tony K's put a pretty penny into their patio full of great looking fire pits.  The Sports bar has 20+ TVs and I don't think you can find a seat that won't offer you a view of the boob tube.  

The menu is a nice mix of traditional American bar food with Mediterranean food.  Not your usual pairing, but it works.  The bar menu is of decent size with a mix of your normal domestics with a nice grouping of finer craft beers.  I think most everyone will find something to drink.  

I haven't had any terrible food here.  While it isn't mind-blowing amazing, it isn't bad.  The house-made potato chips are pretty good, but I'd order a side of dip or something to go with them.  The lemon chicken is quite tasty and I'm always willing to go back and try another menu item.  

Tony K's is clean and the service has been good on all visits.  I think Tony K's is a good option if you're in the greater Berea area."}
{"text":"The variety and quality of the food and drinks is outstanding! Everything is an excellent value. Our waitress was prompt and attentive. One noticeable flaw was that a party of two who had arrived a short while after us had been completely ignored by the wait staff. Only after one of the guests walked up to the bar area to get someone's attention did a waiter finally hand them a menu. This was about 10 minutes after the guest had arrived. A ball game was on several big screens and the vast majority of patrons was preoccupied with this sports event. The dining area was not very busy, and there was no excuse for patrons to have to wait so long to even be acknowledged. This off-putting situation is the only reason why this wasn't a 5-star dining experience. We will return soon and often."}
{"text":"Sorry Tony, 3K's and yer OUT! 
We've had 3 bad visits in a row the last year or so. 
1st we both got sick (splat) on some bad condiments. 
2nd the server was saltier than the food. And didn't take our coupon on a formality.  So we got duped again...
3rd time was to go order. Put our sour cream, tartar sauce, butter and coleslaw in the box with steaming hot fish / pierogies, so of course they were pretty warm at home. Threw all that away then cut open baked potato which was smelly and dark brown through out. Not sure if old or rotten but became more garbage. 
I don't trust their food nor food safety procedures.  
Not to mention, their \"outdoor smoking section\" is not sufficiently separated as smoke billows into the non-smoking section, causing us to move tables. 
Sorry but there are waaaay too many good places to waste time in this unappetizing establishment!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it first opened. My kids learned how to read the adult menu and order for themselves here. How can I not love it??

The menu has been consistently good. The all time favorites have stayed (even with some improvements), while the rest of the menu stays fresh.

Service is also consistently good. 

I've never preferred the dining room...we always go to the bar seating or patio when the weather is good. 

I've found their daily specials to be great tasting, and the portions to be generous. When the kids were still at home, we always went here about once a week."}
{"text":"We went back this weekend and had a really good experience except with the waiter, seemed like he was more interested in the bigger parties. I hope next time we will get better service."}
{"text":"Typical bar food at a restaurant price. Didn't taste terrible but wouldn't make a special trip back. I had the Reuben, most definitely have had better. My sister ordered garlic Parmesan boneless wings and they were so greasy, definitely had better wings too. We were in the area and someone told us to go there.. Maybe that's their kinda thing.."}
{"text":"Great environment! Great lunch specials! Great service! If you are in the area this place is  a sure stop!  The menu is perfectly priced!  The subs are well worth the price!  Averaging about $10 a meal!!  Service is on point!  Great environment, friendly staff, and perfect menu to accommodate anyone's appetite!  A must stop and a must see!  I rated them a 4 only because I wasn't able to check out their restrooms for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Classic sports bar and grille.  Atmosphere was exactly what you would expect in a clean, well managed hang out like this.  Service was somewhat slow, but they were very busy when we were there.  The food was very good and the beer was cold.  If you are there for a more quite dinner, they have seating in an are away from the bar as well.  I would go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"This is the easiest review to write because Tony K's is the epitome of average. The food is incredibly average, the ambiance is a typical sports bar, even the location just finds a way to be average. 

The menu is huge, which is a good or bad thing depending on your preference. I never really have a reason to go to Tony K's, there are better places to go in Berea alone. But it's definitely not the worst place to eat or drink."}
{"text":"Good food and great place to catch a Cleveland game on the bar side. Want to eat in a quiet environment, eat in the dining room. Great Middle Eastern food.
Highly recommend if you are in the area"}
{"text":"We live right by Tonys and as we drive by we always noticed how packed it was! Thinking this was sure proof that the restaurant was good, we tried it one day pretty randomly. However, despite the full parking lot, I was not at all happy with our meals or the atmosphere. It seems to serve a much older demographic. Even the menu seemed dated. Don't get me wrong, the food was ok, just not what I thought it was going to be. With all that said, I still want to give it a second chance, preferably when they serve chicken paperkash!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  We split a Mediterranean Feast.  The chicken was a little dry, but still good.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was pleasant.  The decor is a bit dated, but clean and warm."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in some time & it still did not disappoint. Our server was friendly & the atmosphere was very nice. We started with the chicken quesadilla- very tasty with a nice spice to the salsa. I enjoyed the Chicken Spinach Artichoke wrap while my husband had the Honey Turkey wrap. Both were very tasty and the fries had a perfect crispness. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the Wednesday pot roast special...the potatoes were a little dry, and the pot roast itself seemed to be out of a package. It was cut too perfect, and was so tender you could cut it like a fork...i suspect it's possibly from a microwaveable dinner...the \"root vegetables\" that came with it consisted of one carrot slice, and the rest was celery. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat IF we get to eat outside, otherwise we don't typically come here. The food is good, but inside we feel more like we are at a bar and not at a restaurant and feel weird bringing our young son there. We ordered the wings, burger, and a sandwich. All the food was good and our waitress was really good with my 3 year old son!"}
{"text":"Their food is good and reasonably priced. We go there for keno and casual dining. Service has never been outstanding but overall the place meets expectations and I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Everything about Tony K's food is average. I ordered some pizzas with my girlfriend recently and the flavour left much to be desired. The atmosphere and drinks are the redeeming factor and there's no shortage of entertainment. 

As a bar: superb
As a grille: mediocre"}
{"text":"I want to thank the staff at Tony Ks for the wonderful service you provided for my family for my aunt's Celebration of Life. The food was excellent but most importantly for us, we didn't have to worry about anything. We could enjoy spending time together and telling stories. Thanks."}
