{"text":"drove by Gastonia and stop by this restaurant. This is a good place to have meal. The food is fresh and hot. There are plenty of choices that I can't even try everything. It is valuable for the price to get this quality of food even better."}
{"text":"This was a terrible idea. It is 2:50pm and now I have to go back to work feeing sick because I ate at this place. It's the same pre-frozen Chinese food that you find at any buffet. The picture on the billboard painted a nice picture but I can't stress how much of a false advertisement that truly was. This was the worst lunch I've had is a long long time."}
{"text":"Wow, I am very impressed!  The restaurant is clean and the food is great.  There is a hibachi grill in addition to the regular buffet items as well as a sushi buffet area.  The sushi is prepared in the mornings so it isn't as fresh as it would be at a sushi bar but it's still good.  I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have never been so mad...ate  lunch then went to pay my bill...waitress came to counter and ask the man at the counter if he had called an ambulance for the elderly (75) woman that had fallen in the bathroom. He turned to her and said no he was not calling...she told him the woman was laying n the floor...he repeated himself...i looked at him and yelled yes you are and headed to the restroom where there she was in the floor...i called 911..the guy got an attitude about the whole thing and I showed my ass. I made sure everyone heard me call him a piece of shit and that he has to show some compassion...turned it around and said I hurt his feelings. Wouldn't give me the owners number or name but ill get ya...just wait lil buddy...."}
{"text":"So we used to eat here when it was Passion. It changed names so we thought it would be worth a try.  The food was ok but then as we walked outside I looked by the door and saw big fat roach.  So this place is a nope."}
{"text":"Previously Passion Grill which my family & I loved. Took my boyfriend here for his first visit and was GREATLY disappointed. Granted it was late but still most food was unstocked and/or cold. Alot of selections were missing. It was just a whole different experience than I'd had in the past. Will most definitely not be back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, several months ago, it was great. Today, I hate that I wasted the gas to drive here. The service was slow and the food was inedibly cold. I arrived only 30 min after opening, at lunchtime but it was awful. Save your money and just get crappy fast food. At least it will be hot."}
{"text":"I took my son and daughter here for Christmas Day lunch and the food was so good and fresh. We loved the fact that there are so many different variety of foods to choose from. The resturant is so clean and the staff is super nice. I take all my friends here and my out of town guest who come to visit our family as this place is a number one pick with pricing right in our budget. The sushi is the best I have ever eaten and my all time favorite is the Japanese grill where I build my own plate and hand it to the chef to cook. My daughter loves the pizza and ice cream. I would have to always give this resturant 5 Stars as my number on pick!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Well I was hoping this would be different than the \"Passion grill\" but it is exactly the same! Boring food....typical buffet food. They do have hibachi which is the only good part but I'd rather go to sake express. Everything else was yuck and left me feeling gross. The desserts were laughable they were so pathetic. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Was Passion Grill.  Customer since your very first day.  Ate there Sunday at 7:30. With Tip was 39 bucks.  The food was really bad except for a small dish from the hibachi grill. No selection of sushi and the food was old, soup was dried up. Wait staff Leah was great though and I did not think she should Miss out on a good tip due to the food. We are regulars but may not return.  This is not the first time but was really bad this time and I needed to let someone know.  It was a waste of money.  Update:  have returned several times and has been bad each time. Contacted the manager and he was very nasty. Refused to return. Name changed to Gastonia Grill. Visited and it was the same thing as before. We will not return."}
