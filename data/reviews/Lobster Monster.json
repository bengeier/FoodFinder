{"text":"I made reservations for Valentine's day. we love seafood especially lobster, so we were excited. we arrived early and were seated. it was small inside but nice it made it seem more intimate. We placed a drink order and our appetizers the Lovin lobster spring rolls which were really good, had a hint of spicy but sweetness from the carrots which balanced  out nicely, & the Cajun calamari. I really enjoyed the calamari it was lightly breaded with there homemade Cajun sauce YUMM!!!!!  For our entrées I got the surf and turf with crispy chips and my boyfriend got Neptune's delight (seafood pasta). As we waited we noticed a few things that made it go from a 5 star to a 4 star review. There was an older couple next to us, they were discussing dessert, a waitress came by and told them to make there's decision very soon or dessert wouldn't be an option cause they needed the table. I found that rude and just a few other little things. We both got the lobster bisque (booming with flavor and chunks of lobster) & the bruschetta (average, nice bite size pieces) our entrées came they were great my surf and turf was amazing the filet mignon was melt in your mouth, steak house worthy. The seafood pasta has serious flavor and the scallops were to die for! Dessert was a sweet lemon cake that seemed like it was bought at a grocery store too sweet. Drink wise I stuck to Stella's and my partner tried a watermelon frozen cocktail which was ok and a ceaser with two massive shrimps that was lacking an essential ceaser ingredient just couldn't pin it ! I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood, seems like a bit of a hidden gem. I will return to this restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"A warm and friendly environment. Marianne and Steve are very gracious hosts. The lobster was outstanding. A great experience,plan to return!"}
{"text":"From start to finish, a very positive dining experience. We ended up trying the restaurant by accident, and it was a very happy accident.

The service was warm and friendly - the owners made sure that we felt welcome. A warm family atmosphere. The decor is charming and fun, and sets the mood for a wonderful meal.

Winners? The clam chowder was second to none as a starter - rich and thick and tasty. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was both delicious and generous - make sure you have at least two people, to share and finish off that treat. The Fish and Chips was also generously portioned, with a beautiful piece of cod laying the foundation. The batter was crispy and light, and the accompanying tartar sauce had a hint of jalapeño that was a welcome surprise. The chicken quesadilla was also delicious. For dessert, the apple pie rounded out a beautiful meal - the apples were definitely fresh, and not canned or syrupy.

Downside? My diet fell by the wayside, but gladly so...and even there, I saw some lighter choices on the menu, but I opted to enjoy myself without guilt, and the delicious choices made that a pleasure.

We may have stumbled on the restaurant by accident, but going back won't be an accident at all. A great choice and one which will be repeated."}
{"text":"Best lobster place I've ever been to. Incredible warm lobster croissant roll. The mac n cheese was also wonderful. 

The owners of the place were super friendly and the inside wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"Okay. To start it's hard not to be a bit harsh I spent many years in Prince Edward Island, where lobster is fresh caught, put in a pot and away you go (shout out to Richard's in PEI on Brackley beach now that's how a lobster club is done, fresh, tons of lobster an awesome sauce and bacon I miss you guys!)

Back to the point, extremely EXTREMELY, underwhelmed.

Came with family, got lobster croissant, except it should have just been called croissant because god knows there was such a minuscule proportion of lobster in there only to be compared to the lobster tacos which had maybe a teaspoon per each one.

If you're going for straight lobster, it is what it is. You get your lobster, decently cooked, nothing special. Suckers were probably iced long ago. 

I will give them some holy redemption for their chowder, hands down best part of the meal we had.  But that's essentially where it is. They make a mean caesar with the typical frozen shrimp unfortunately it will cost you over the $10 mark for the drink. Don't recall the price exactly all I know was it truly made them lobster monsters!

Advice: if you go stick to the main event and move on from there!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had amazing rich lobster bisque, great lobster rolls and quesadillas. I like decor aswell get little place. I would def recommend to those in the area or any lobster fans with cars."}
{"text":"Food was great and service fast and friendly. Ambience and sides could use a little boost. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my boyfriend last weekend and it was absolutely amazing. From the moment we walked in we were warmly welcomed by the owner's husband.  We arrived there about an hour before closing but they assured us that they wanted us to take our time and completely enjoy our experience. And that we did! The food was to die for and we will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The lobster roll was decent, I was disappointed that it was served with Frozen french 
fries, for the price of the dinner you would expect fresh fries!  The lobster Mac and cheese was bland with no flavour.  I will probably just wait to have a lobster roll when I go to New Brunswick before returning to Lobster Monster"}
{"text":"I just love this place. From the moment you walk in, the eclectic decor just grabs you. It's very warm, welcoming, and lively in there. 
We had a large group for my birthday of 9 people and we were all very happy with our meal. We were somewhat of a disorganized group because we had people arriving at different times, people chasing after children, etc so it was difficult to get us all to order at the same time. But the staff were very attentive and kept our drinks coming and our appetizers came out.
We had the sample platter and we were not disappointed. The spring rolls and the dip were amazing! And the platter was huge! 
We all ordered different things and in most cases, the food in reality was better than what was shown in the pictures. If you've seen their pictures you know how delicious looking that would be. My friend ordered the burger and loved it. Others ordered various sizes of lobsters and they were cooked to perfection. I had the Neptune pasta and was not disappointed. It was absolutely delicious and well worth the price. 
No complaints on my end and I would definitely recommend this mom and pop shop to anyone and everyone. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Must get the bruschetta & lobster bisque. 



Lobster Monster is truly a one-of-a-kind restaurant!

The service was beyond average and really made me and my guest feel like we were friends in her kitchen.

The food portions were HUGE. You truly get what you pay for.

Food verdict:

Small lobster $33 with the additional $9 package (mash potatoes, bruschetta, corn, coleslaw, seasonal vegetables & lobster bisque)
= A, the mash potatoes were a bit bland, but everything else was delicious! The bruschetta was probably the best i've ever had. Who would have thought a lobster place would be the place to perfect bruschetta?!?! The lobster bisque was very creamy and loaded with lobster.

Neptune linguine $30? 
=A-, the linguine was it's own presentation... I'm talking about lobster tail, giant shrimps, huge scallops all presented on a plate (which was more like a platter) of linguine!!! When people say they have enough for next day's lunch I always think they're exaggerating or have tiny tummies. NO. You will have more than enough for lunch for the next day. TRUST ME.


Decorations= A+

Service = A"}
{"text":"Came here for husband's birthday and it was fantastic! A small place but very cozy and comfortable. We got lucky and were seated without a reservation so make a reservation if you plan on coming - especially if you're a big party. 

Husband started off the night by ordering a Caesar - it came with a giant prawn! I didn't get a taste but he said it was very good. Next came the bowl of lobster bisque. Our bowl came with 3 smaller bowls to share (2 adults, 1 toddler) and we drank every last drop. It's so creamy with tender pieces of lobster in it, and the lobster flavour is phenomenal!! Get this one for sure! They also offer a smaller cup size, but the bowl is definitely a bigger bang for your buck. We also got garlic bread and bruschetta which is full of fresh garlicky goodness.

For our mains, I ordered Neptune's Delight Seafood Linguini. This giant plate contains 2 rock lobster tails, 3 shrimp, 3 scallops, lots of baby clams and some lobster meat all mixed in a creamy marinara sauce, served over a very generous portion of linguini. I love that there was so much seafood in this. All 3 of us ate from here and we still packed home half of it. 

Husband ordered Lucious Lobster White Mac and Cheese. So creamy and cheesy and utterly delicious! Another dish the three of us attempted to eat and still packed home half of it. 

We had no space for dessert, otherwise we would have gone for Karat cake. 

Definitely a must try if you're looking for lobster and/or seafood dinner. The menu is pretty extensive and there's a lot of other dishes I want to try. Next time, I will plan accordingly and bring a bunch of friends so we can all share!"}
{"text":"I came for the name, I stayed for the lobster. Very welcoming and warm atmosphere (the yelp pictures don't give it justice).

A+ service
A+ menu options
A+ giant sampler with snow crab, filet mignon (surprisingly delicious!), bacon wrapped scallops, a lobster tail, mashed potatoes, and a lot of butter. 

Being from out East, I'm a bit of a grump when it comes to seafood in Upper Canada, but Lobster Monster really impressed me. 

LOBSTER MONSTER!"}
{"text":"Went here last week and was pleasantly surprised. Seems like a family run business and was fairly busy which is always a good sign. 

I had the Lobster Tacos. They were ok, but I wouldn't order them again. There just wasn't a huge amount of flavor.  
My friend had Neptune's Delight.  That's what I should have gone for. It is very large and cost $38 but the few bites I had of it were delicious.     

I will definitely return and know what I'll be ordering next time."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby.  He is a big fan of anything seafood.  I don't mind it, but not obsessed with it.

SERVICE - was amazing! Very tentative.  Came to our table several times to make sure we were topped up with water.

FOOD - Appetizer, we ordered the lobster spring rolls.  I must order!  It was perfectly crispy.  My hubby ordered the Neptune pasta dish.  We found it was reasonable priced for what you get.  A lobster tail, lobster claw, 3 shrimps and 3 scallops.  The flavor was good, but not exceptional where we have to come back.  I ordered the fish tacos.  Didn't have much flavor and found the fish to be dry.

It was ok, but not exceptional.  Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Overprice, food below average. I won't come back. I am so disappointed.  Service is good! But food food food !!!!!!"}
{"text":"When you've got a name like Lobster Monster, you better deliver on the Lobster! 

I went for a light snack after work and ended up getting a couple apps and a drink. Their special shrimp-wrecked caesar was a sight to behold with large prawns decorating the rim of the glass.

The bruschetta reminded me of when I was young. It's a simple and humble dish but really nostalgic and delicious. 

Finally, the star of the meal arrived. A lobster salad with succulent, juicy hunks of lobster; they definitely did not skimp on the meat! It was a pleasure to eat here and I'll definitely be back for another meal in hopefully the near future. 

For a full review with more pictures, feel free to check out my blog, conveniently located in my profile. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Sunday night, and it was a great decision. The food is delicious, their house-made hot sauce is to die for and the portions are generous. The owners are super attentive to all our needs.. The overall experience was just a great one! 

Try the bruschetta and the lobster poutine with lobster bisque, paired with maple syrup. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place when I was on the subway ride home and the TTC lost power and closed all subways in both directions. I got stranded at Lawrence and I was getting hungry, so of course I pulled out my phone and checked Yelp for what's good in the area. 

So I ended up coming here because of the high reviews and I'm glad I did! Me and my boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque, cold lobster croissant roll, and the lobster poutine.
The lobster bisque was delicious and generous amounts of lobster in it. The croissant roll was good, but not as filling as I would have hoped. However, they give a large portion of fries. My favourite dish is definitely the lobster poutine- fries, mozzarella, lobster, maple syrup AND lobster bisque. So delicious! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals we have ever had in Toronto - and we've had quite a few. I have never left a bad review of *anything* online but I couldn't let this one go.

We couldn't get a table at Stack (which is amazing) a few doors down, so we decided to try Lobster Monster. It was unbelievably bad. The kids' meals were halfway decent but:

- the garlic bread was basically a bunch of hamburger buns with garlic butter on them
- the fries were the same frozen McCain processed fries that they serve at cheap cafes at Harbourfront
- the salad was overdressed and gross
- the kids' hamburger was dry and overcooked
- the CORN was undercooked (it is not difficult to cook corn on the cob. come on.)
- the actual lobster we got was awful. It had the bitter aftertaste of a lobster that hasn't been cooked properly. The claws were stunted and deformed and the shell was mostly empty (the explanation was that the lobster was at a particular point in its moulting cycle, which - I don't know? But as a fair bit of the weight of a lobster is in its shell, we felt like we had been bilked)
- the service was inattentive, though kind. The kids were served a full half hour before the adults, which meant that by the time the adults were served, the kids were ready to leave.
- the prices were INSANE for what you get. We spent $130 including tip on a dinner for two adults and two children, which did not include any alcoholic drinks. 

The staff seemed like they were trying their best and I kind of felt bad for them, but this was the worst meal, for a crazy amount of money, we've had in a long time. Please do not go here. I was genuinely offended to pay what we paid for what we got."}
{"text":"My friends hosted a surprise birthday dinner for me here !!! 

The food at this restaurant are very tastey.. Alot of us order the various sized lobster dinner meal. 
My order of small lobster was $36 + $9 to add bruschetta + lobster bisque to make it a meal.
The Bruschetta was beyond expectations.. And they give you 4 big pieces.
They also ask if you would like regular or garlic butter for your lobster and i 100% recommend trying the garlic butter.

We arrived quite late on a Wednesday night. Supposedly the restaurant closes at 10pm but we didn't even order until 9:30pm - however this did not affect the service at all !! The owners of this restaurant are Super friendly and nice.

Overall i would recommend coming here if you feel like having a nice lobster meal. Probably one of the best lobster restaurant in toronto."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant at Yonge and Lawrence.

Came here on valentine's day... made last minute reservations the day of, and the place still had availability... not sure whether that's a good sign or not.

Though the menu and the street sign for this restaurant is kinda cheesy, the interior was nicely decorated and had a homey feel.

Tried the lobster bisque, fish taco and lobster mac and cheese.

Lobster bisque: yummy, creamy, but our soup bowl didn't have much lobster

Fish taco: lots of sauce that kinda overshadowed the taste of the fish.  There wasn't much fish, but the veggies and seasoning made the taco quite tasty.

Lobster mac and cheese: it was overly creamy and I didn't really like it.  Maybe I'm more used to the traditional mac and cheese but this mac and cheese tasted more like a spirally pasta with Alfredo sauce. 

Ambiance was good, service was good, but the food was so-so."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with warm, home atmosphere. The food just to die for, everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Really great good, service and ambiance. Decor is conducive of typical coastal seafood restaurants which I found whimsical and nostalgic so I loved it. Service was impeccable. Husband and wife run operation and the couple care about their diners and the quality of their food. This much is obvious. Food was outstanding. Had the lobster bisque - best lobster bisque I have ever tried in my life and I've had me a lot of lobster bisque. I want another serving just thinking about it. Also had the bruschetta which was totally on point. Absolutely delicious. The lobster tacos were also incredibly fresh and came with a generous serving of salsa and sour cream. We ordered the plate to share (4 tacos) but it wasn't really an entree size, maybe just an appetizer to be shared so might best to move it over to the apps section of the menu. Overall, this place is a winner and I will be adding it to my roster of frequented dining establishments."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and its expensive cause your eating lobster. The service is always great. The portions are pretty decent. Nice little place if you got those lobster cravings."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was good, not great. Service was a bit slow. The main dish looked great, but the lobster was overcooked and tough. I'd like to try it again. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish and should have gone with the traditional steamed lobster."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and should've been tipped off by the near empty dining room. I will say the service is good and the waitress was very friendly and helpful but the positives end there. I don't know if this place thinks that seafood needs to taste like it's still in the ocean  but everything was insanely salty like the chef dumped the whole box in there. We had the cheesy lobster dip and the mussels and we're disappointed by how quality protein was disrespected by salting the living hell out of it in addition to being overcooked and chewy like rubber. The lobster then came with about half a pound of nasty red lobster eggs still in there with some brown crud which I mistakenly thought was seasoning but which I fear was something a lot more like the lobsters last meal... thank God the lobster wasn't too salty but the margarine instead of butter dip was again, full of salt. Bottom line, this place is expensive, and the food isn't nearly good enough to warrant the prices, we had high hopes but we all left disappointed and threw away the leftovers. Save your time and money and just go get a lobster from the store and boil it yourself you'd probably do a better job..."}
{"text":"Very good food and awesome service. They go beyond to ensure a good experience. Had the bisque to start. Exceptional. East coast good. Also had the crab legs which were also very good. Plan on returning....like this weekend."}

The lobster bisque was delicious and lobster pountine is a must try.

I must say they pay attention to details- hand cream in the washroom 


U  will love it here"}

{"text":"Lobster and snow crab legs were frozen not fresh. Service was nice, a bit informal. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Super pleasant staff and fresh seafood. I had the best lobster poutine. You had the option to choose regular gravy or lobster bisque. Our server recommend the lobster bisque and it was amazing. For once there was enough cheese- everywhere from top to bottom of the plate and chunks of lobster. They gave a side of maple syrup which also complimented the poutine quite well. I also had the clam chowder soup which was rich and full of clams. For our mains we tried the lobster Mac and cheese and cold lobster roll. I found the Mac and cheese too cheesy and I was not able to finish it. On the other hand, the lobster roll was not bad, again filled with chunks of lobster. I would highly recommend the lobster poutine and clam chowder soup."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a party of 4. The decor was fun but a little on the budget side for the prices they charge. Food was good and the service was friendly....the Ceasars were awsome. The salad should be bigger and cheaper with no lobster in it,  more selection of potatoes is needed. I don't recommend the lobster martini. The yam mashed potatos had too much nutmeg .They need music in the background to add to the feel. The owners were great and are still trying to iron out all the kinks of a new restaurant. ..they were open to suggestions. Our bill was over $450 but that included 3 or 4 drinks each. 
Overall is was a fun night and we will come back one day."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is great and the owners are very friendly and nice :)!! Lobsters and seafood are fresh. Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. We got a free parking in the side streets. 

Only cons is that they charge $1 per cup of hot water.. Which we wasn't aware of until we got the bill."}
{"text":"Decadent Lobster Bisque ~$9 -tender lobster pieces in an extremely creamy soup.
Delicious!

It's Canadian Eh Lobster Poutine ~$18 -lobster chunks, bacon, gravy, cheese mozzarella, fries served with maple syrup
This is the ultimate poutine and is Janey approved. I would come back here just to get this menu item!

Lobster Croissant Roll ~$22 - lobster, warm butter croissant, celery, cilantro, peppers, capers. Served with a pickle and coleslaw
Generally, I'm not a huge fan of bread, but this completely turned that around. Everything went well together and the vegetables balanced out the butter. The lobster chunks were generous and very fresh!

My 1 hour experience here topped my Maritimes Trip I had a few years ago. xD;; The different ways they prepared the lobster was innovative and the seafood was very fresh! Also, Marianne, the restauranteur of Lobster Monster, is a total sweetheart and she livens up the restaurant with her charisma and smile."}
{"text":"We were craving lobster roll one night - Yelped some options and 30 minutes later were seated at Lobster Monster checking out the menu!

We ordered the cold lobster croissant and the lobster grilled cheese. Both got a bit soggy but definitely hit the spot to satisfy our cravings. The grilled cheese was better than the croissant - would for sure order it again."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting. I have NO idea how this place has as many stars as it does?! People must not know good food! The lobster is frozen, I repeat: FROZEN. The lobster Mac and cheese is more like lobster in a soupy powder cheese sauce. And the bisque is soggy and just straight up unappetizing. If you're in the mood for fresh lobster, I would suggest Smoked & Cracked instead. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I will start with the quality of the dishes here, they are amazing and taste incredible! The owners are so friendly and accommodating. The decor makes you feel like you are dining on a pier in Florida, very cute. The prices are high but it is totally worth it! It's one of our favourite places to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday a few months ago, and I still think about their Lobster poutine with lobster bisque, it was THAT good. Their Neptune's Delight pasta was pretty good and portion is huge. Will definitely recommend seafood lovers here."}
{"text":"Located in the Yonge and Lawrence area, the rather typically tacky seafood restaurant decor of Lobster Monster is made up for greatly by the brightening hospitality displayed by Marianne, one of the owners of this establishment, all the way throughout the dining experience.

Of course I had to choose the lobster poutine--yes, with bisque--and needless to say it was a monstrous dish. Served with maple syrup for a dash of sweetness to top the Canadian theme, my only complaint about it is how monstrously stomach-heavy cheesy it was. Okay fine, they don't actually use cheese curds here also, but you're probably having too much lobster to care.

Overall a welcoming and fun place to enjoy lobster in taco form, lobster rolls, or just plain old lobster!

{TTC: Lawrence subway station, Ranleigh Ave exit. (If only Toronto labelled their exits like many Asian transit systems do...)}"}
{"text":"I'll give you two guesses what Lobster Monster's main feature is. And it's not \"monster\".

The best thing about this restaurant is not the lobster, but the service. The owners are a husband-and-wife team, and they make sure to keep the place running like a well-oiled machine (the only squeaky wheel is the unresponsive water filler, but at least she's semi-decent at staying on top of refills).

Maybe I'm just a sucker, but normally if a restaurant goes so far as to put a type of food in its name, I develop pretty high expectations. Granted, we didn't choose plain ol' lobster as our meal, opting instead for poutine and rolls (cold). The poutine, unexpectedly, came with either traditional gravy topping or unorthodox bisque (which the server VERY strongly recommended, curiously...); we took the bait and ordered bisque. While the flavor wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly memorable. It created a somewhat bland texture that seemed to muffle the enormous piles of cheese curds hidden along the bottom of the plate.

I'm not extremely versed in lobster rolls (just cinnamon rolls), so I'll refer to my girlfriend's description of them: average. From my noob perspective of them, the ones here were extremely messy and the celery was...well, celery. Who wants celery on anything, let alone a LOBSTER dish? That'd be like taking a delicious steak and adding cilantro to the top of it. Then again, the folks at Lobster Monster are obviously more knowledgeable about how lobster hits the palette than I am. I guess if I don't like it, I can take my unexperienced-in-lobster ass and open my own restaurant!

The overall wacky vibe of the restaurant is odd, too. There are cartoony lobsters on the place mats, and the overall atmosphere is very casual. I guess if I'm spending close to $100, I at least want to be reminded during the meal that the ticket is going to come to that price by way of crappy candles on the table that simulate a romantic setting, or carpet."}
{"text":"First I have to say the owners of Lobster Monster are super adorable, enthusiastic and extremely nice people!

I attended a charity event at Lobster Monster for a set menu. We had the Soup, Lobster Poutine and Cold Croissant Roll, Brownie Sundae. Their lobster seemed very fresh, nicely cooked and didn't leave any \"sea\" taste to it. 

I lovedddd the Lobster Poutine. I would've never thought to add Maple Syrup to poutine if I haven't tried here! Definitely a must try.

The croissant roll was different since they used a croissant instead of normal bread. I thought it was okay because I'm not a fan of green onions and there were lotssss of onions in here. 

All in all, the experience was quite good since the owners were extremely friendly and made us feel welcomed. The food is on the heavy side, great portions to share since some are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"My first experience here was somewhat of a disappointment. I was in the neighborhood and checked the \"nearby\" feature on Yelp, and this place popped up, with a 4-star rating. I guess my expectations were a bit too high from the start. 

When I walked in around 6:30pm on a Tuesday evening, there was only one other table occupied. I asked my server for some recommendations, told her which dishes looked good to me, and she pointed out the seafood linguine, stating that it's one of their most popular dishes. In hindsight, it seems odd that she would mention the popularity of a dish rather than how good it tastes. But I can understand why she said it that way; it may be popular, but it's certainly not a great dish. It definitely looks way better than it tastes. 

The lobster itself was dry and it was obviously previously frozen; I think it was in the freezer too long because the shell didn't even crack when I used the crackers to break the shell. It just kind of squished like it was waterlogged. The scallops were cooked very nicely but the prawns were overdone a bit. The biggest sin was lack of seasoning - it was so bland, I had to add a fair amount of salt and Parmesan cheese to coax some flavour out of the dish. At that point, I had eaten all the seafood, so I didn't feel right complaining about the dish, so I waited until I was done eating to mention something to the server. She seemed quite taken aback, but immediately questioned my ability to discern what good food tastes like, because she got quite defensive and said they'd never EVER had anyone make a negative comment about the food there. I guess she was implying there must be something wrong with ME. In any case, it prompted me to come back and read some reviews, and lo and behold, there are a few less than favourable ones on here. I guess it's not just me after all. 

Restaurants are empty at prime dinner time for a reason. Instead of acting defensively, perhaps consider that some customer comments might actually be valid and try to learn from the constructive criticism and incorporate some minor changes - instead of acting as though there's no room for improvement. That's how you alienate good customers. Perhaps that's why the place is pretty much empty."}
{"text":"Summary:
I expect better lobster since this is \"Lobster Monster\"
It seems like the lobster is used to make a higher margin.

Speed Read:
1) Husband and Wife Owned - Friendly.  Ask about anything
2) Great: Bruschetta, Poutine with lobster bisque
3) Soso: Lobster, Clam chowder

Early September

Great Service, they explained how it works, and let us change stuff on the menu.  They quickly fixed an error on the bill without hesitation.

The first and best thing we have is the Bruschetta.  The fresh tomatoes combined with herb, (thymes leave), serve on a warm toast is a great start.  I didn't expect it from a lobster place.

The poutine with lobster bisque and maple syrup is Unorthodox way of making poutine:
- Thicken lobster bisque on fries is a good combo
- maple syrup always goes well with seafood (like maple glazed salmon)
- Cheese was soso, but it works
- The lobster in the poutine is out of place.  it shouldn't even be there.  The lobster should stay out, but they can't charge that much if there's no lobster.
Lobster on the poutine is probably frozen precooked lobster, so it only taste so so.  

Clam chowder is disappointing, with not much clam taste.  Don't order, it's not worth it.

We order the fresh lobster on their menu that comes with corn and baked potatoes.
- Fresh lobster - Not an expert at it.  I had better fresh lobster cooked at home.  This lobster might have been starving the some time, the meat texture is a little soft.
- Corn - not very good.  They claim farm fresh corn, but I expect much better corn in September
- Baked potatoes...it's a potatoes serve with everything on the side."}
{"text":"I definitely would go back! We arrived ahead of our reservation and had no issues getting a table. The owner/ server provided great services. 
Food was great. We ordered the mussels, tacos, lobster poutine and also the mac and cheese with lobster! The portions were generous and we couldn't finish the food with 2 people! Lobster poutine used the lobster bisque as gravy and it was delicious! ( it would be better if there was more)
The only downside with the restaurant is the air circulation as it felt greasy when there were more lobster orders out. Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and enjoyed it every time. They have a big range of options to choose from. You can go for the classic steamed or boiled lobsters with all the fixings or comfort foods such as lobster poutine, lobster mac and cheese, clam chowder, lobster hotdogs, Lobster Monster Nacho (my fave nacho) and so much more. Conveniently located at Yonge and Lawrence. It a nice family run restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Lobster Monster to celebrate our son's 23rd birthday. The place is really cute. I adored the clam chowder... rich and creamy, filled with clams and goodness. This was followed by Neptune's Delight which lives up to its name. Both my sons enjoyed the lobster bisque, smooth and creamy yumminess. The birthday boy ordered a medium lobster which was served with birthday candles in each of its claws.. so cute and a nice touch. My daughter-in-law had the lobster mac and cheese... a rich and decadent delight with lobster pieces throughout. There was enough to have for dinner the next evening. Lobster grilled cheese and an order of snow crab completed our dinner selections. Although we were all too full for dessert, we were treated to a piece of birthday karat cake. All in all, a delicious night out with the family. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"HITS THE SPOT everytime.
 Such a unique joint with a super homey feel. must try their Lobster bisque!!! 

We had the cold served lobster salad served on a warm butter croissant &triple decker Lobster Grilled cheese It was heaven. 

Btw the Karat cake - 
(They don't do slivers according to Marianne)"}
{"text":"Came here for last minute dinner on Valentines day as my boyfriend did not plan anything.  We got there around 8:30pm, the restaurant was not busy which is surprising for vday.  

I was not very hungry at the time so we only order two entrees (we couldnt even finish).  We ordered the seafood linguine ($63 normally $33) and a small lobster dinner ($69).  The entrees came with a choice of lobster bisque or clam chowder and brucshetta or garlic bread and a side.  The lobster bisque was one of the best i have had in Toronto, you can tell its homemade with a generous amount of lobster meat in it.  The bruschetta was definitely memorable, my bf couldnt stop eating them (he ate most of it because he loved them that much!). The lobster dinner was fresh. The seafood linguine was HUGE. Lobster, Tiger shrimp and giant scallops toss with marinara sauce.  i thought the sauce was lacking a bit of flavour but other than that this dish was great.  

Service was great.  it's family owned, the servers there are so friendly which gave us a cozy feeling.  

Overall, I thought Lobster Monster was great but the price was a little too steep for Valentine's day (it was 2x the price on the menu!) I would most likely visit again for other items on the menu on a regular day when the prices are more reasonable."}
{"text":"Overpriced! How do they only have two $$ on yelp? Their sundae and cake slices are $9 each!!!! Their mango smoothie which just tasted like concentrated canned mango blended with ice is $5!! You will easily spend over $50 for one person and the food is not to die for. The warm croissant roll is a nice idea but the lobster poutine and mac and cheese were just ok."}
{"text":"10 of us were at the Lobster Monster on Wednesday.  Marianne and Stephen treated us to a feast.  This is my third time there.  No hesitation recommending."}
{"text":"The past Friday was a special dinner here with my young family as well as a prelude to my birthday weekend. After stumbling upon some awesome reviews on Lobster Monster, I was reunited after a near decade with my dear mentor-friend and publisher of a women's magazine I freelanced as a Food Editor at the start of my career, owner Marianne Woo. She and her husband Steve have dreamt of having their own restaurant, and one day they looked at each other and said, \"Let's do it! Let's go for our life's dream and share what we love with others who love food too.\" They are so inspirational that way! Running the front of the house, they really set themselves apart from others with great hospitality, great food and great conversations which are at the heart of their cosy restaurant. 

The ambience evoked a warm casual vibe, perfect for entertaining couples, large groups and families with young kids. I loved all the beach and dock wall adornments especially the paintings and quotes, and seriously how can you not fall in love with the picnic checkerboard draped table cloths! And the food-- beyond D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S and the portions were super generous! We had their fabulous Lobster Poutine, Lobster Dinner and Neptune's Delight Seafood Pasta-- everything was fresh and succulent. My family had a blast and we can't wait to come back and try their other menu items... Thank you! For more on our fabulous dining experience, please see my blog post: http://susanssavourit.blogspot.ca/2016/02/lobster-monster.html"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to celebrate our 16th Wedding Anniversary.  Best choice I could have made.  Marianne and Steve were fabulous hosts always smiling and checking on you to ensure your total satisfaction. As was mentioned on several reviews, the bruschetta was fantastic.  The lobster was fresh and very flavourful.  The atmosphere was inviting.  There was nothing I could find fault with other than that the meal had to end.  Yes, it had to end for this evening, but we will return for other ones for sure.  Don't miss out on this one, by spending your money at some other seafood restaurant that is half as good and probably double the price.  Bring your appetite along.  You can't go home hungry.  Oh yeah, there was also a vase of roses waiting for us at our table.  That goes way beyond anything we could have expected.  Thanks Marianne and Steve for making this an Anniversary to remember."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and had a throughly wonderful experience. Made Open Table reservations for 7:30 and when we showed up at 7:25 our table was ready and seated promptly. They immediately informed us that the kitchen is backed up so it set our expectations appropriately. We ordered the lobster bisque, lobster poutine with the bisque (the maple syrup came but we didn't use it), warm croissant lobster roll and the seafood linguine (Neptune's.. Something, I forgot).  Pretty much all the dishes were pretty good: the bisque may require a bit of salt but I was happy with it as is; a salt shaker is on the table :). And the poutine was great - perhaps (is it possible?!) a little TOO much cheese. I guess there are worse problems. At this point, the two of us were already full but the entrees were still to come! I just ate half the roll and the lobster (which was yum). And my partner had about 1/3rd of the linguine and it was pretty good; the broth was appropriately flavourful for such a wonderful looking dish. I would highly recommend all the dishes we tried. 

The only miss was the take out container. I didn't want to lose the broth from the linguine (not sure how it will taste today..) but the clamshell styrofoam container probably wouldn't be great to stop it from leaking. Aside from that, I appreciated the great service from the friendly staff and being told when to expect our food (which was delicious). 

Would definitely come back if the opportunity arose!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my boyfriend and we were blown away. I'm a pasta kind of girl, always love nice pasta dishes and the Lobster Mac'N'Cheese is easily the best pasta dish I ever had. I left floating, and with plenty of left overs! Super friendly and attentive service, we are already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions and the warm welcoming staff. I live in this area and this is my favourite restaurant by far. There's a really nice homely atmosphere when you go into a place and the staff remember you. Added to that the food is great. Favourites are the lobster and beet salad (if you want something lighter), lobster poutine with maple syrup (may sound a little odd but trust me it's fantastic), lobster bisque, lobster tacos... lobster mac and cheese! Everything i have tried has been really tasty! Warning though... the starter platter is HUGE.  I don't know what the put in the dip for the chips but it's awesome. Getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Lobster Monster on a Saturday for an early dinner with friends and was excited about what they had to offer. The menu is quite overwhelming as there are many choices. My friends had ordered the lobster bisque and were pleasantly surprised at the chunks of lobster in every spoonful. The table had a few orders of the warm croissant lobster roll which was delicious. I personally had the Neptune pasta and was amazed by the huge portion size. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce but overall, there was lots of seafood and a generous portion given price being paid. It was also nice that we were given complimentary bruschetta and garlic bread for our large party. Overall, good food and good service! Come for your lobster fix and more."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with a bunch of friends. We were the only table there which made me feel bad because they deserve more customers! The people there were so nice. It was freezing that night and they offered me a hot cup of water right when I enter the restaurant.

The menu is huge. Luckily, I took a look at it the night before like a true foodie so I knew exactly what I wanted. I opted for the Neptune's Delight (hearty scallops, tiger shrimp, baby clams, 2 oz lobster tail and a mini lobster claw, 
served over linguine tossed in a fresh made marinara sauce with a touch of 
cream for a smooth finish). I thought that the scallops were done exceptionally well. The lobster tail was a bit dry though but the mini lobster claw was good. I wish there was slightly more broth in my pasta because it was delicious. The seafood taste was subtle (but there) and it wasn't overly salty. For $33, I thought that this was such a good deal.

It's a bit of a drive for me but I want to come back to try out more dishes!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent on a Friday night although it was empty inside, but I was in a group of 7 people.  There was another table of 4, and when we left there was a table of 2 that arrived towards the end of our meal. Service was attentive and smiley.

I ordered the warm lobster roll (lobster served on croissant.  After tax and 18% tip it was $32.  Size was okay and I wasn't starving, but I wasn't satisfied either.  It was bland and towards the end I decided to eat the lobster a lone with a fork because the croissant overwhelmed the bland lobster, which defeated the purpose of paying big bucks to lobster.  It came with a tiny amount of fries and I'm picky about fries and I was told they were coated/battered when I asked upon ordering, which isn't my cup of tea (cheapened it) and I decided to be adventurous so it was my fault and I ate them.

Wish I ordered the lobster bisque instead.

I would not go back except to try the for lobster bisque.  For the price, I feel I could get better seafood elsewhere.  Maybe I didn't get the right dish?

Sorry Lobster Monster your service was great so this was difficult to review!"}
{"text":"One of the selling points of coming here was all the lobster-related things - duh. On our trip to Toronto, I wanted to make sure that we would hit somewhere with a lobster roll because I'm from the middle of the US, where we're landlocked. So let me break it down for you:

Landlocked = No fresh seafood = Exorbitant prices for anything seafood-related

We ordered the Lobster Poutine, and one of the owners encouraged us to order it with their Lobster Bisque gravy, instead of the regular gravy. I was 50/50 about it, so I let my boyfriend make the final decision. He decided to go for the Lobster Bisque gravy. What they don't tell you when they make the suggestion for it, is that there is actually an up-charge of $3. It's printed on their menu in small print. 

I honestly can't tell you if the poutine was better with the lobster bisque gravy. I would assume not, as I found it forgettable. So I say that you should save your $3 and not get the lobster bisque gravy. Other than that, the fries had the perfect texture, and there were plenty of cheese curds to go around. 

My boyfriend and I both ordered the cold Lobster Croissant Roll. I don't feel like Lobster Monster is the best place to introduce lobster rolls to someone who has never had one. But alas, I didn't realize that at the time. I found it to be average, and my boyfriend thought the same, which is too bad because it was not a great first experience for him.

The owners were there, and they were extremely nice and were very conversational with the patrons in the restaurant. We came for an early dinner, so there were a lot of older folks in there, and they really enjoyed talking to the male owner. While the service was great, my only gripe is with the small water glasses. Small water glasses should be banned because they get literally nothing accomplished. 

Other than that, it was a good experience, though I don't think I would come back. I would likely try to find somewhere else for a lobster roll.

Overall: 3/5
Food: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 2/5"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for awhile. Reviews are decent, so we were actually surprised with what we got. Keeping in mind that we did take out, so the lobster was overlooked by the time we got home. They charge $10 extra for the boiled lobster, Lobster Trap( just south on Yonge), provides this option at no extra charge. The lobster was nothing special. We also ordered the lobster bisque, this tasted like cream of mushroom soup with tiny pieces of lobster in it. Does not taste like traditional lobster bisque at all. We also go really stale and gross crackers to go along with it. I would normally give this quality  of food 1 star, however, I did appreciate the fact that they provided wipes, bibs and made sure everything was wrapped in tightly in foil. Nothing spilled and the food was still warm when I got home. 
There are much better lobster places in the area."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service from a family run restaurant! Had the lobster croissant and Shrimp cocktail Cesar - would highly recommend and would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and nice staff. I went on a Friday night and it was not busy at all. No need to make reservation and no wait time. I love their Patty and Lobster melt munwitch. The toasts are buttery and crispy. The patty is very juicy and tender. Gotta try their Srirachi (house made)  hot sauce if you like spicy. I packed two home :)"}
{"text":"Lobster Monster is a Lawrence park favorite. The food is always amazing and the owners are a lovely couple. 10/10 Recommend!!"}
{"text":"We both enjoyed our meal. The Lobster bisque was really tasty. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Was excited to hear of this place from a friend. It is conveniently located along the subway line, and as the name suggests specializes in various lobster concoctions.

ATMOSPHERE:

Decor had a kind of coastal-vibe to it. Great place to grab a bite and drink during the summer months. Owner mentioned the recent renovations, and that they would be opening the doors up that adjoin to the patio in time for the warm weather - so should be open now. Place was empty when we were there, but hopefully fills up more now.

FOOD:

The bruschetta here is fantastic! Best I've had in quite a while...moist, fresh tomatoes, with just the right amount of oil. The lobster grilled cheese had me mighty excited, but was actually just OK. Although they were generous with the chunks of lobster, there was a bit too much bread and not enough cheese, so it came out really dry. Highlight of the meal was definitely the lobster poutine. There's the option to add lobster bisque (extra) instead of gravy, and it was absolutely exquisite! Poured on top of the crispy fries and chunks of lobster (again, they don't hold back with that), it was among the more unique and tasty poutines I've had.

SERVICE:

Our server was extremely attentive, and made sure to check-in on us frequently (perhaps a bit too frequently to be honest haha). We appreciated the attention to detail though, and how quickly she brought the food out. Her friendliness and willingness to chat about the history of the place was nice. A plus in my book, apparently the owners try their best to keep the restaurant as \"Canadian\" as possible, having most of their seafood shipped from PEI, rather than the US.

VERDICT:

If you like lobster, and a good place to eat/have a beer, this is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a bit of lobster added to their favourite dish :)

Lobster Monsters whole menu focuses on the tasty crustacean, either on it's own or added to already popular dishes, with some non-lobster items or some basic seafood options for those who prefer.

The menu will make you drool, and you will pretty much want to try one of everything.

We went on a weeknight, and the place wasn't super busy so we got stellar service and even some (absolutely amazing) bruschetta to start on the house!

After both of us deliberating forever over the menu, and convincing ourselves that our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs, we opted to share a lobster poutine, substituting the gravy with lobster bisque + add bacon (cue drooling), and a lobster grilled cheese with their hand cut chips (now cue heart attack).

Sounding soooo promising we were super excited to eat here, but sadly the food fell a bit short, thus the score of 3. But nothing so bad that it couldn't be easily improved. I still have hope for this place!

The bisque on the poutine was not hot at all so the dish was room temp and the cheese didn't melt. The taste was great, but poutine needs to be hot and gooey! The bread for the grilled cheese was super super thick and super hard and had become that kind of toast that scratches the roof of your mouth every time you bite. It also wasn't hot enough, and even with the overcooked rock bread, the cheese was barely melted, and the lobster portion was a little underwhelming. We left feeling pretty disappointed. 

I think there shortcomings are easy fixes, and hopefully over time they improve these small things because their menu really does sound amazing and the service was so great. I will give it another shot in the future and hope for the best!"}
{"text":"Who would've thought that the large marine crustacean once deemed as 'a disgusting bottom feeder' and only eaten by the poor would climb it's way up the social ladder to become a true delicacy, a fancy meal, a 'Just got paid' kind of dish.  Lobster in this day and age is a luxury and while I'm reluctant to cook it myself, there is a number of worthy seafood restaurants in the city that serve up the real deal. One new place that takes lobster to the next level is the newly opened Lobster Monster in the Yonge and Lawrence area.

Owner's Steve and Marianne Woo are passionate about lobster and aren't afraid to get down and dirty with the clawed creatures. They incorporate the succulent meat in a variety of comfort food items creating some classic dishes such as lobster mac and cheese and lobster grilled cheese . You can also order lobster in the old-fashioned way where it is steamed in boiling salt water.

I arrived at Lobster Monster with a moderate appetite and left in a serious food coma.  Marianne reminded me of my mother as she was very proud of her cooking and wanted to make sure that I was completely satisfied with my meal.  Every now and then she would come out from the kitchen and chat with the customers which really added to the dining experience, it felt like she had invited us to her home for dinner.

We started the night off with a pint of beer and a bowl of clam chowder and lobster bisque.  Both items were piping hot and served with biscuits and garlic bread. I really liked the clam chowder because of the rich flavour and heaps of baby clams and potatoes in the mix. The lobster bisque was just as good and was the perfect bowl of comfort for the chilly evening.  At this point I already felt the food coma kicking in...
Lobster Bisque & Clam Chowder - $7 for a cup

Next up was the bruschetta which was incredibly fresh.  The bread was very soft and the homemade tomato mix on top was delicious. 
Bruschetta - 4 for $6

Next item was the lobster spring rolls. These look like a traditional spring roll but were stuffed with chunks of lobster and veggies.  They were quite tasty but you really do need the homemade voodoo dipping sauce that they come with, its sweet, spicy and tangy!
Lobster Spring Rolls - $10

Then it was time for the lobster mac and cheese, one of my favourite items! Marianne brought out this huge bowl of it and I looked at it with fear and love.  I ate the entire bowl of this creamy pasta and loved the tender chunks of lobster meat with it.
Lobster White Mac & Cheese - $15

Next was the traditional lobster poutine and the poutine topped with clam chowder.  How I was still alive at this point is a miracle but then again poutine is my weakness.  Both poutines were pretty decent, I liked the traditional much better than the clam chowder poutine only because the chowder one was quite hearty.
Lobster Poutine and Clam Chowder Poutine - $16

Marianne tried to hint at some dessert from their list of homemade desserts but unfortunately I couldn't fit it in my already expanded stomach.  There were some tempting desserts though that I will have to try next time.

I loved the experience at Lobster Monster and will be making my way back soon for a proper lobster meal, bib and all."}
{"text":"I give this five stars because we got there at 3 pm and they weren't open but they still served us and amazing service and we loved the food. Lobster poutine was the bestest and the lobster itself was fresh and flavorful. Amazing and great service. Excellent"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. Big portions but we cleared it all. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very attentive social service, great food and the prices were really reasonable.

My girlfriend and I started out with the lobster dip with fresh made chips. Absolutely fabulous.

We both ordered small lobsters, and I added the package option, adding a soup, garlic bread and house made coleslaw and potato salad. Splitting the addons and the dip was way more than enough food for the two of us, and we're pretty good eaters.

Oh, and BTW... If you like a spicy Caesar to sip on, don't skip the Monster sized one here... The two shrimp are huge and are almost a meal in themselves.

$130 for all the food, my Caesar and a nice red for her... Tax and tip included."}
{"text":"I went there with 3 of my friends. We ordered the two big platters, a lobster bisque bowl, and a caesar salad. There was enough for all and everything was AMAZING. The best lobster bisque I have ever had, steak was cooked perfectly, and there was a right amount of seasoning for all the food. I would definitely recommend this place for a good seafood dinner."}
