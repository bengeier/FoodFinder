{"text":"Wake up on sat/Sunday morning usually hungover lol and  come here for breakfast basically every weekend. Good little hometown spot just down the road from my house. Cheaper than Dennys. But so bomb and convient. Yes, does need cleaned and updated but the breakfast is great!"}

{"text":"Great food, large portions, amazing price! My wife and i go there often."}
{"text":"This is a great find!  The Boston Diner in Clairton, PA offers a time traveling experience with good food, great prices, and excellent service.  Their breakfast offering covers all the traditional breakfast diner stables at an amazing value, for less than ten dollars you can eat enough for two and eat very very very well.  Lunch time it can get crazy with the rush, but they get you in and eat as best they can after serving up some delicious food.  If you're in Clairton and looking for a good eat, head on down to the Boston Diner!"}
{"text":"Talk about the best diner dives this is it! This was our first time trying the diner there was 2 of us  we were very pleased the food.  Perfect were my eggs The service was very good and the girls were very awesome, we did not just have our waitress but they all came to serve our food a total of four! They all pitched in and they were so friendly nice and smiling away! the place is old and dive looking.  but will definitely go back again great food thank you!"}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Boston Diner from a relative of mine who lives nearby.  So when I was returning from doing a site visit (oddly enough in Boston, PA which is miles away), I thought I'd stop in for some lunch.  Don't let the rather blah exterior or the really old-school decor fool you.  They've got great sandwiches here cheap!  And I understand the breakfasts are good too."}
{"text":"I love this place!   I make my way here almost every time I am in the Pittsburgh area for a great breakfast and friendly service. If you are looking for someplace that is sparkling clean,  modern, and boring,  go to some big bland chain.   If you want fluffy pancakes,  perfect eggs (yes,  perfect almost every time), and a real local feel,  Do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Only a 4 star for me because the menu doesn't really enable you to eat healthy.. so if you're on an anything goes diet, this is a 5 star American Diner. Friendly service, local charm, authentic decor, its a greasy spoon by the text book definition. The home fries and bacon were outstanding, the pancakes are the go-to type -heavy, medium firmness, 1/2 inch thick. Coffee is from a 1970s-80s Bunnmatic. Very good coffee for non-\"fair trade, artisnal, blah blah\"  its not aficionados coffee, its the coffee that let men weld and assemble the American economy in the 60s-80s. This place is a must try."}
