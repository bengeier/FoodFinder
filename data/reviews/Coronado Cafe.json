{"text":"We tried the Coronado Cafe last night, and it exceeded our expectations.  The ambience was lovely, service excellent, and the food was fabulous.  Their meatloaf (this is NOT your mother's meatloaf) has to be the best on the planet.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Can't beat steak n eggs for $5. taste good too.ive been coming here for years n I'm not tired of it yet. I couldn't tell you how anything else taste tho, it's all I get lol. go after midnight eat good, then order one to go so you wake up to the same goodness. doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Ok I change my mind, not only are the cashiers stuck up and cranky (the graveyard ones at least) but some of the servers are sh**** as well. Specifically this Filipino guy.. I don't know if we're allowed to put names on here, so I won't. But he was very curt, and didn't even greet. Only reason why I even come back here is the food.. and the only reason why these people are getting tips is because I work of off tips. Piss me off..."}
{"text":"Very glad I found this cafe on Yelp.  The food is fresh and delicious- and fast.  The staff is friendly- it feels like a neighborhood cafe.  I will return when in town again to try more selections from the menu."}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally got to enter the cute little home on N 7th Street where Coronado Cafe is housed for Saturday brunch.  I was impressed by how cute and cozy the restaurant is.  Our waiter was amazing, very knowledgeable about each plate, funny, and genuine.  My mimosa was rather yummy as well.  Now for the food: As my friend that ate brunch with me, \"This place did not blow my hair back.\" The food was not that appealing.  I cook better brunch/breakfast meals that what I experienced there.  I had the : Arizona Omelet for $10 which comes with three eggs scrambled with caramelized onion, tomato and cilantro, green chili crème and avocado salsa, 9-grain bread, café potatoes & fresh fruit*  Ok, so you would think that my meal would have been overly, lip smacking, yummylicious delicious; it was not! The caramelized onions were overpowered by the tomato and cilantro, the green chili creme and avocado salsa were missing their sex appeal/flavor/spice.  The 9-grain bread was yummy, and the fruit was decent.  The potatoes were the best thing on my plate.  Also, my friend wanted to have their \"Best Crabcakes in Phoenix\" as a part of his meal, but they would not do it.  They only have the crab cakes as a sandwich and nothing else.  He really wanted to have a crab cake omelette, which sounded like a great idea, but in order to do so, they would have to \"add\" the crab cake to the bill, for an additional $9.00.  Give me a break!! Coming from the East Coast where I enjoyed many seafood delicacies at the NJ/NY/MD shores, I am sure that their crab cakes are not even worth an additional $9.00.  I digress!!  Overall, everything was pleasant.  I will more than likely not go back to eat, but I am happy that I got to visit and see what the hype is supposedly over!  Cheers"}
{"text":"This Cafe is GREAT! They raised the price on the midnight special menu and recently enforced the \"must be 21\" rule. Even if an individual is at least 21 with a group under the age limit. I can't say that they will decrease in business, but they sure lost mine. It upsets not only me, but many other individuals that rave over the Steak & Eggs experience."}
{"text":"Good food at an excellent price.  Fast service and friendly staff.  Very generous portions, had to take half of it home"}
{"text":"Consistently horrible, slow service, mediocre (at best) cafe/casino food, extremely long wait times. We've given this place a shot twice on two different visits, and while there are countless empty tables surrounding us, we have waited for over an hour both times. We will never eat here again. If you don't have time to burn, do not eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters, the host sat us and said \"we have a party coming in at 7pm; do you think you will be done by then?\"  After that warm welcome we found our water glasses had lipstick on them (both of the glasses).  We ordered the bruschetta (pretty good); my husband had the bacon/cheese burger and I had the meatloaf sandwich.  Burger was good, sandwich was very mediocre.  For the money and the food, we probably wouldn't go back.  The inside of the restaurant was very charming but that is about the extent of what impressed us."}
{"text":"The experience here was wonderful. It was a quiet and personal venue that helped me get a delicious burger and let my girlfriend enjoy a light/fresh salad. Guys- excellent dinner spot! Ladies- great flavorful food, and light on the portions."}
{"text":"The only thing here that was better than my lunch was the service. I had liver and onions and it was served hot, tender and delicious. I also had the beef barley soup and that too was hot and delicious. The wait staff is extremely attentive. Not often you get this quality in a casino 24 hour cafe. I know where I will be eating the rest of my stay. I just added a piece of chocolate cream for good measure. Delicious flakey not graham or frozen crust."}
{"text":"We stopped in South Pointe on a recommendation, for a pit stop and breakfast. After walking around, decided on Coronado Cafe. My daughter is allergic to pork, yet we wanted breakfast. Our server, Cathy, was very accommodating, and let us sub the chicken sausage pon the side with their special. Cathy let the kitchen know, and she says it would be a little longer because they needed to clean a grill (they cook the potatoes with the pork)  We were fine with that!  Then the food came... My veggie frittata was flavorful, but the clear winner was the Coronado Special my kid & mom split was amazing! My kid doesn't eat even chicken sausage normally, but tried it. Her smile & face was wow! (Usually even chicken sausage has pork casings, patty has no casing). Tasted like home cooked, great service (never ending coffee) , loved server Cathy from Jackson!! We're coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 4am for breakfast.  If you are under 21 you cannot order from the specials menu so you pay full price for breakfast.  Full price is still a decent price so that was no problem.   I ordered the steak and eggs and it was just ok.  The steak didn't taste like much I had to add salt which was weird enough because I don't think I ever salt my meat lol. The eggs were good and everyone else enjoyed their meals.  One person got a breakfast burrito and it was huge...better be for $9.99!  Someone else ordered a ham steak and eggs and he said it was delicious.  Really, really weird though, we had two people order steak and eggs the steaks were two very different cuts and the one that was to be well done seemed a lot juicier and tender then the medium rare one.    Service was quick and the staff was decent and somewhat friendly.  IT WAS 4 AM I think I would be annoyed and irritated with just about everyone at that hour.  But I wasn't...I was hungry lol.  Overall ok not too bad for the price.  Will come again because it is 24/7 a bit away from the strip and still good enough to eat when you are hungover or just hungry for breakfast after a long night.  C"}
{"text":"This review is not about the restaurant itself but about a manager named theresa at the coronado cafe. This so called manager rudely told my brother to sit up from the booth or she will call security on them ( my brother laid down to stretch his back because he have some lower back problem, but that besides the point).   My brother sat up like he was told and told the manager that she didn't have to be so rude about it. That's were she lost it and called the security to kick my brother and his group out. They were not drunk nor they were loud or out of control. When I found out what happened, this manager started to lie about what had happened and was also giving me an attitude for asking her what had happened. For a person that works in hospitality industry, this person lacks manner and professionalism.  I'm always playing at this casino and always go the coronado cafe. I spend thousands of dollars playing here and to be treated like this is unacceptable especially if we didn't do anything wrong."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced and friendly service.  Nothing mind blowing, but solid, and I'll definitely be back.  Had the crabby benedict side of bacon and a $3  bloody.  I want to come back and try the Kahlua french toast.  Parking is easy with a good size lot and room enough inside for small group brunch."}
{"text":"i love this cafe everything on the menu is super delicious... the bar is awesome wish there was a tid bit of more room here ... i had such an amazing expirience i will deffntly suggest this too everyone it is a must... the staff especially is amazing  and in uniform as well always  oh so busy even at the latest hour   the cookies are great and the whle theme is aswell..   go for urself an expirience some great u deserve"}
{"text":"I just moved into a new place, and Coronado Cafe is right around the corner. The menu looks great, the wine list is well-rounded, and the opportunity to stumble home after several glasses of vino gave this place major points before I'd stepped in the door. I WANTED to like it, but I'm not sure that I'll go back.  My fiancee and I were seated by a friendly hostess at a small table in a cozy room at the back of the restaurant (house). It had the opportunity to be intimate, but it was over-lit, and we felt awkward hearing every word of our neighbors' conversation.   We started with the Brie and Lavash, which was wonderful. All of the flavors melded together perfectly. Around the same time we ordered a bottle of wine. Our waiter poured us a glass, and that was the last time he touched our bottle for the rest of the night.  For entrees I got the penne pasta in a green chile cream sauce (rich and tasty--one of the few vegetarian entree options), and the fiancee went with the pork tenderloin (dry and chewy). The portion that he was served was the end of the tenderloin--a piece that rarely makes it onto the plate as an entree because it is notorious for being tough and dry. Our server never came back to check on our food, so we didn't have a chance to make it right.   To sum it up: a snotty, inattentive waiter and hit or miss food. It might be best to go for an appetizer and bottle of wine. Just be prepared to pour it yourself."}
{"text":"We always go here before the theater.  Good food at a reasonable prices.  Service is excellent.  Friendly atmosphere, good location and on site parking.  The salmon and crab cakes are delicious.  A nice selection of dinners and sandwiches.  Food is prepared and presented well in a warm and cozy environment.  Highly recommend.  Chuck Thompson"}
{"text":"been here twice now and I am impressed with the food and the service.  I really like the ambiance.  The Lavosh and brie app is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Love this place. Quaint.  Nice owners.  The meatloaf is fantastic.  Reminds me a little of home in Mn.  .. . old house."}
{"text":"So lucky to be in town to eat here again.   Brie and Lavash: I loved it. Basically a brie covered cracker type bread with a little sour from the balsamic reduction with sweetness from the pomegranate and pear.I cannot adequately describe the dish but it's great.   Cafe Meatloaf: I could eat this every day.   I wish this place wasn't 400 miles away from me..."}
{"text":"For a Las Vegas coffee shop open 24/7, The Coronado Cafe is really quite good on some things, and average on others. The Chinese food is fantastic, they have the -best- pork egg fu young in Las Vegas i've had! Lots of yummy treats in it, and the brown gravy is thick and rich. I -crave- this! They also have daily specials, and they have always been a delicious value. Mondays, the roast pork loin is moist, tasty and for $10, you could not make it better at home, cheaper.  The porterhouse steak special is a HUGE let-down! It was tough and gristly, and just not good.  At midnite, they do have graveyard specials for $1.99 that are cheap and filling, and for the price, who cares if it's a tad greasy! It's a coffee shop, what do you expect!?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good date place or somewhere to have great food and conversation, this is your place. The restaurant is in a remodeled home, it is very quaint and eclectic environment. We had a wonderful waitress and the manager/owner welcomed us and comped our dessert because we couldn't sit at the bar. We had a caprese salad that was really good, not perfect, but very good. The salmon rolls stuffed with crab were over the top delicious. Also, had a glass of pinot noir, very good. The Key lime pie was easily the best part. I enjoyed my food, my wine, and my environment. GO!"}
{"text":"Come here for the graveyard specials after midnight! I always get steak and eggs, but they also have cheeseburgers, pancakes, etc. They raised their prices, but everything is still under five dollars, which is still awesome for the amount of food that you get. I never leave disappointed after steggs, and I eat here pretty often. The servers here are all really friendly and attentive too."}
{"text":"First off, I went by here for lunch one day and its NOT good.  The \"Dirt Cheap\" reviews people leave is only because its for the late nate crown like 1am or later, AND you have to be staying here.  I mean, this hotel is a shit hole, why would you want to do this?  lol    I was on my way out of town and yelped lunch hoping to find a good quality lunch at a decent value, as I was already off the main strip.   Stopped in here after seeing the pictures which looked great, BUT all those specials are only for a super late night special only.   In fact, they didn't even sell those during regular hours, which is odd.  Ok, so you have Chinese food, which is about $10-13 for lunch, and the pad thai was garbage btw.   I could see how the average white person would never notice the low quality, but it will not slip past me.   Three of us ate here, we all agree after spending $50 total it was a complete waste.    Sorry, but Eek! Methinks not.   Maybe now other yelpers out their way out of town off the main strip will know whats up!"}
{"text":"Since I last reviewed the Coronado Cafe, the portion shrink ray has hit some of my favorites. The kung pao chicken now barely fills 1/3 of a dinner plate; and the pad thai seems shrunken as well.  In other updates, the prime rib is only served until 11P (maybe I was wrong last time saying it was 24H) and the wi-fi is now pay-as-you-go."}
{"text":"Love it here, best steaks and eggs ! Great for locals and the staff are awesome! I'm a regular here all the time :)"}
{"text":"Such a gem of a place in the heart of town. We were looking for a place to go to for a celebration dinner and while driving down 7th Street we chanced upon Coronado Cafe.   The cottage feel about the restaurant appealed to me immensely. And to add to the appeal was the 'limited' menu. They took ages to prepare our order but the wait was well worth it. The bourbon and cherry BBQ chicken was oh so delicious! My husband ordered the roasted pork tenderloin, it was a little too rare for his liking but he voraciously devoured it nevertheless.   I must admit that it was a little difficult to read the dinner menu because the only thing illuminating it was candlelight. Our only disappointment was that we never got to taste the creme brulee because they had already sold the last one when we ordered it. We have been on the look out for good creme brulee in Phoenix and we will ask Coronado Cafe to reserve one for us the next time we drive down to Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good and portions were large. Decent prices for the food, but $2.99 for mediocre and weak coffee. Also, service was efficient but not friendly. If service was friendly and better coffee for $2.-. this would of been a 4 star review. They need to study what the Golden Nugget or Station Casino's 24 hour cafe's are doing."}
{"text":"So like every hotel this is the South Points 24hr cafe.  To be honest its not much different then any of the others.  Decent selection of breakfast/burgers and sandwiches.  What makes this place special is 2 things.  1) they serve Chinese food.  Don't get me wrong its not the best ever but for this style of cafe, its great. (rice is a little dry sometimes)  2) the late night menu is the best!  From midnight til i think 5am you can get a maybe 8 or 9 different things dirt cheap.  Granted a lot of cafe's do some sort of late night menu.  I think the overall quality for what you are paying for is better here.  I may be off in my prices below but not by much.  biscuits and gravy for 1.45, a cheeseburger for 2.95 and the best, steak and eggs for 3.95.  I can't remember what the other items are.  My friends and I have gone here many a late night and the quality is always the same.  I think its hard to say that for regular restaurants let alone a 24hr cafe.  Sadly the word is out on this place and it has started to get a decent line were a year ago you could go right in.  Its still worth it as the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"I can't seem to figure out why this place has such a low average rating when I personally dig the fact that this place is amazing anytime after midnight.  I haven't eaten at this place before midnight but from browsing the menu, they have pretty high price points for a cafe. Their after midnight selections, though, are a totally different story. Steak and eggs for under $5, a cheeseburger and fries for under $3, and quite a few other options all under $5. They also offer Chinese food, which I have not tried either but have been told by a friend that the quality is quite tasty.   On each of my visits after midnight, there has always been a line to be seated but never fear, the wait is never long, maybe 5 minutes tops. Once you are seated, the service is not the best but nowhere close to bad. All the employees, especially the ones who first greet you once you are seated, are very friendly and make it an effort to ensure that you are taken care of. I love coming here after a long night of gallivanting or even after catching a late movie 'coz we all know nothing is worst than going to sleep on an upset, growling, stomach!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here around lunch time on a Saturday afternoon. We were the only patrons in the restaurant.  I had a 3 dollar mimosa, and Nick had a mixed drink on the menu with gin.  The drinks were really good.... I only wish the service had been the same because I never was asked if I wanted a second, and I was never asked if I wanted any water.  When the food arrived it was delicous.  My sandwich was tasty and the salad with goat cheese was AMAZING!  I will be going back to have the full salad. Next time we go we will go during a busier time of day, maybe the server will be on his toes, instead of gabbing to the bar tender."}
{"text":"Ate their 2x last week.  The service is crazy slow and add in some \"who cares\" attitude from some low-rent servers.  Reason for 2 visits is that we were staying at the resort.  I've eaten there many times over the years and it has gone done hill, way down hill.  There was a time that you could not beat a casino coffee shop for value and quality.  Neither exist here unfortunately.  No excuse for soggy cold food especially when the restaurant is not busy.  Why can't one item be brought out by itself?  Why must it be part of a huge tray?  Where is the food cooked --- Detroit?"}
{"text":"The food is really good; but (and it's a big but) the prices for a lunch are ridiculous!  I took a client here and the seating is so close together that it's extremely hard to hear the person you are sitting with.  It was pretty uncomfortable and I won't be returning.  They should really look at the pricing structure here; $3.00 for a glass of ice tea, seriously!  The cost of that ice tea is about .05 per serving people.  I must say for paying over 40.00 for a lunch is a bit much."}
{"text":"The service was great. We had kids and everyone was super friendly and extremely attentive. (We were the only ones there on a Friday night at 5 though.)  Food is where it goes downhill. We got the crab cakes which were only mediocre. The ones I make are better and they don't cost $24. My husband got the surf and turf and it was not good. Again, I make better shrimp and better steak and it's not $26. I think Applebee's makes better steak and shrimp to be quite honest. The veggie bean burger that my kids got was decent, and the spinach artichoke dip was ok. Would definitely not go back here and would not recommend anyone else waste their money."}
{"text":"I stayed at the South Point Hotel and had to catch morning flight to San Francisco, so I had my breakfast at this place. I could say this is about average for a quick breakfast. They did run some special from midnight to 6am, so if you like staying late, you may get some good deal."}
{"text":"Had the graveyard special steak and eggs and took almost an hour to get. Wasnt even goddamn busy. Fucken bullshit south point!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood joint for sure!!  Tried this cozy little spot when I first moved to Phoenix and have been a fan ever since. the ambiance is great. Just like dining in a little old house. Very intimate, clean and romantic. The service is super friendly. The food is phenomenal for the price. Extremely affordable, not pretentious, and just plain tasty. I'm a huge fan of the open faced crab cake sandwich and the BLT wrap (?) I can't remember the menu item names. Pomegranate hummus was delish! Everything is fresh and tasty.  This is just a well rounded, casual neighborhood spot. I haven't been disappointed since.  The only reason I give this spot four stars instead of five is because it's not quite fine dining and it's not mind blowing. It's just plain good with a nice atmosphere and at a good value."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and found nothing worthwhile on the regular menu so we tried the Chinese menu.  The Hot Pot sounded good but was not: it was NOT Hot Pot but merely a bowl of fish and sparse vegs with tofu and wet iceberg lettuce (yuk!); a Hot Pot anywhere else is a steaming soup with myriad of Asian vegs and tasty meats with sauces AND they use nappa cabbage not cheap hamburger lettuce.  The Sweet & Sour Pork was way too sweet so we had to return it.  The Buddha Feast was not: it was a lot of non-Asian vegs of the rooty variety (carrots, brocolli, asparagus) instead of the tastier cruciferous Asian vegs such as bean sprouts, snow peas, onions, bell peppers, nappa cabbage, mustard greens, etc. Already sent a complaint to the buffet manager months ago about their bad service, but got no response so I don't expect to get 1 here either so I'm leaving my review here instead.  Unlikely they will change their cooking protocols so I'll just avoid the place."}
{"text":"...Great breakfast.  Our group of 8 found the food top notch and the service quite attentive.   Will return on future visits to LV."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed this cafe for brunch but they blew us out of the park tonight with a private party we had in their patio. They let us bring our decorations, helped us move tables around, and also allowed for split checks which is usually a pain to restaurants. I was worried about the traffic on 7th street being so loud but it wasn't even an issue- the patio had such a great atmosphere with the lights and the warmers. And the food was as always- AMAZING! The owners are from Maryland and they serve the best crab cakes in town- worth the visit! You won't be disappointed in this charming restaurant with quality food and service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Coronado Cafe, really enjoyed our food and the time spent.  It is a solid place that is in our regular rotation as we stay close by when in PHX.    Mike"}
{"text":"This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!  Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it.   We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and we had our hopes crushed by how disgusting the food and service was. I ordered the chicken roma which came with salad. The salad was gross and was definitely not fresh. The chicken was extremely dry and chewy like rubber. The pesto sauce was cold and didn't even taste like anything but oil; the corn and rice was probably microwaved. After taking the first few bites, I couldn't finish. The other plates had burnt hash browns and moldy and stale bread. Overall, I will not be eating here ever again. It sucks."}
{"text":"Steak was ultra bland and the service was so so.  Nothing else I can think of really - it was late.  This place is just a good place to sit down and take a break after gambling all night."}
{"text":"This is a cute, charming little place.  My mother's blue burger was scrumptious.   My husband and I ordered the cafe burger which was good, but didn't hold a candle to the blue burger.  Beverage refills without being in your face.  I would come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my girlfriends and every time I've ordered the same thing...b/c it's delicious!  The crab dip is cheesy and delicious on top of their citrus tortilla chips and the Farm Salad is worth every penny (especially with the chicken).    I am excited to bring the rest of my family to this cute little place...my favorite little place...on the corner!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I decided to meet here for lunch since neither of us had tried it. It's a very old and not very well kept building with a gravel parking lot so when I was greeted, not with a welcome but with a 'do you have a reservation?' from a very snobby waitress, I was immediately put off. No, we didn't have a reservation; it was 11:40 on a Wednesday morning and this isn't Capital City City Grille, lady. And when I told her no, I got the 'look' if you know what I mean (like I'm the idiot). And mind you, even though we didn't leave until 1, only half the tables were ever full. Onto the food: It seemed like a decent menu but the prices were way too high. I ordered a wrap with potato salad ($13 lunch plate price - wow). The wrap was horrible, filled with a very greasy aioli sauce that was dripping out of the overcooked tortilla, but the potato salad was good. We were visited ONCE in the 75 minutes we were there (still snobby, like we were inconveniencing her by being there) and had to track down the waitress in order to get our check. My friend really liked her salad which is the only reason this place is getting two stars instead of one. So if you're looking for over-priced mediocre food served by a snobby waitstaff in a building that's trying so hard to be trendy it won't even put a fresh coat of paint on their walls - this place is for you."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best date place in central Phoenix.   Sadly, I was apparently not on a date and ended up having to pay for our bill BUT in retrospect I was still so damn impressed by this place.  Rumor has it that this place is owned by several male flight attendants and when they're not attending flights they are running this restaurant. Leave it to world travelers to produce a classy but quaint but sosticated but understated establishment that can truly please everyone. In true Phoenix fashion, Coronado Cafe was once a house and now stands as a Bistro Cafe. The front porch is now patio seating with cute little tables and bench style sitting all under canopy drapes and string lights. On the inside is the cutest little bar area, very small, but the older gentlemen running the place is so cute and you can tell he really know is cocktails and puts passion into crafting each one. There's also a secluded side patio that's ADORABLE.  We ate inside the dining room because the rain (rain, I know... in Phoenix?) started coming down and the wait staff was so attentive and helped us relocate. We were sat in the corner by a window that had its own little garden bed outside. Could not get over this palces cute factor. Tables were small but candle lit and had the presh checker print table clothes, real napkins and honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had.   We order 2 Tequilatinis on Happy Hour and the artichoke dip. This artichoke dip opened the gates of heaven and brought to us the most delightful, out of the ordinary, festive taste I have ever had. It was spicy, but cheesy. It was melty but had good size chunks of artichoke. Simply, cannot go on enough about how good it was.  I cannot wait to go back here and have brunch or enjoy the sunset with drinks on the patio. If you're looking for somewhere small and intimate that you'd like to take a significant other or truly impress someone you care about, pelase go here. Everything is perfect for the perfect date."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Food is nothing to tell your friends about but would have given our experience three stars if not for the very disappointing Peking Duck. This place is 24 hours and that is the reason we ended up here."}
{"text":"4 stars should be good to them, food is very good especially the chinese food. Been here many times and I really like it. Service is good as well, never had a problem with any of the server yet, they are friendly. The only thing I hate is the food takes forever to serve. I get full by drinking my soda already. But anyway I recomend this ppace to my yelpers. By the way graveyard specials are good too. Very cheap. Steak and egg for $3.95 beat it!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I like coming here for late night, you know, like 2am type grubbing after drinking.  I was in town two weeks ago for a company event and met up with the friends who live in Vegas and came here after having plenty to drink and got breakfast off of the late night cab driver specials list.  I can't complain - $3 for eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast will do the trick.  Will I come back?  Obviously, YES!!"}
{"text":"I must say, when moving to Phoenix a year ago, I was disappointed with the restaurants around the city.  I had tried all these places that were supposed to be just amazing but was always left wanting more.  The Coronado Cafe filled my expectations more than I had expected.  It was one of the first places I had heard about when I moved here a year ago, but never got around to trying it until recently.  I was pleasantly surprised with the food and thrilled with the atmosphere.  Little houses converted into restaurants have a certain charm about them that big corporate restaurants will never be able to create.    The food was fresh and tasty but not overly fancy.  They offer a nice, inexpensive lunch menu and a more upscale dinner menu.  The service was unique meaning I did not feel like I had my own personal server slave for the time I was there.  I felt like he was somewhat stand offish, but we always had refills, etc. when we needed them.  In all honesty, it was nice to not be interrupted a million times by some disgruntled robot of a server who clearly hates their job.  So even though the service was not the typical upscale service, it was still good; it just had its own flavor."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm a a local and I work in the restaurant industry as well, so I know how service works. I came after watching a movie with my family and since I've only been here once with my husband for a late night dinner, we enjoyed it. As soon as we come in the door the host just points his finger to the host at the end of the restaurant meaning \"go to her she will sit you\" or so I think. We go and the hosts takes us to the booth . As we sat down he took our drink selections right away with a pretty emotionless face no smile no \"hello, how are we today\", nothing. So we did take about 5 minutes to order since it is a rather big menu selection, so we let the server know we still needed a few. more minutes to decide. I guess the server Marlon decided to take quite a long time to come back to us since we ended up waiting about 10-15minutes. When he finally did, we ordered and he acted with a careless attitude and said \"OK\" and left. OK, that's fine I guess. Then the food took quite a  long time, we were planning on leaving since the server was careless and everything seemed to be taking ages to come. But we didn't, we gave it another shot. My mother really didn't like the water soo much so she wanted a raspberry ice-t so when Marlon came walking by we asked him for one. Never came with one so we asked the young lady who refills the drinks to bring us one. She finally did with a smile as well.  Finally when the food came  at last, we eagerly ate with satisfaction that made me a litter happier. So then we don't find the server Marlon for about 20 minutes and my nephew and brother wanted ketchup and soy sauce ,we waited to see if he was ever going to show up again, he didn't,.. what a surprise. So I saw the manager and waved her down to see if SHE can bring the condiments to us she said \"Of course\" with a smile. I thank her for that ! we finally ate in peace and Marlon came at the end of it all and we asked for boxes, he came quickly with those! And we got the check and went to go pay. Thinking that was the worst ever, I was wrong!! The cashier was the rudest. When I asked her politely if she can split the check, she said 'yeah\" with a rude attitude. WHATEVER I thought!! Then as we signed the receipts I thought why tip, but MARLON was lucky to EVEN get a penny FROM ME,  but I gave him a dollar ANYWAYS because his quality of service was just that of a dollar. So as the cashier asked if we wanted our copies we said yes. And she gave me mine, then My mom didn't see her copy so she went back to her to ask for it POLITELY the rude ass lady slammed her hand on the copy and said \"HERE\". I'm sorry but if you don't have time to have a smile and manners to be in the service industry no matter how old you are you should QUIT and go elsewhere. I put up with the rudest people at my job but yet I have respect for anyone who has the decency to smile and act polite!! My family and I didn't deserve such shitty service, no one does! THANKS for nothing!"}
{"text":"Great specials, decent food served all day long, adequate service.  Unfortunately expect a long wait after midnight. Which can be a bit of a turn off when you're drunk and want food NOW."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and have breakfast or lunch. The ambience is pretty and food is excellent. Crab cake is a must have."}
{"text":"Damn! I expected the worst but I actually got some pretty decent food! What made it so good was the genuine kind service from Elizabeth H. I've never had late night comp at south point she helped guide me and my guest through the menu! The results were great!! I'm in the industry... her attentive kind service was so refreshing to find here. Table was marked for courses accordingly and waters and drinks were always refilled. If you come here you should just ask for Elizabeth. She is officially my new call server here!"}
{"text":"Try the crab cakes open sandwich with a glass of Reisling. Delicious.  The flat bread levage with brie, strawberries and balsamic reduction was very nice too. Service, ambience and decor all made for a very relaxing and five star meal."}
{"text":"Cute and spunky place with delicious food! Ordered the crab cake appetizer and Brie and lavash... Both were delicious. The crab cakes are super authentic... Taste just like the ones you get in Baltimore. The food is pretty pricey and the portions are small...that's the only negative. But it is a local place, so it is somewhat justifiable.   The people working there are a little bit awkward, but nice.   Probably the best part about this place is that it is in an old house... It has a great ambiance and lots of character. Definitely a good place to check out and try in down town Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are at this place almost religiously. So much that we have come to recognize all the regular hosts, wait staff, bussers, and cashiers. We even have given many of them nicknames. I have yet to try this place in the daytime because the late night specials is where it's at. I can personally vouch for every item on the late night menu. My personal favorites are the steggs (steak and eggs) and the biscuits and gravy. If you're looking for a place to recover after a night out drinking with some solid food, this is it. Service may not always be the greatest depending on who your server is and how busy it gets, but it's hard to complain for the price you pay."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the dessert I had quite some time ago. I went to dinner elsewhere and was told the Coronado Cafe has the best chocolate cake. I was expecting an ordinary chocolate cake, but let me tell you, the chocolate cake with cream cheese icing is exquisite! Very moist, very rich, absolutely delicious! We were fortunate enough to grab the last 3 pieces. Wish I lived close enough to grab a piece to fulfill my chocolate cravings! Cake isn't cheap, but worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Lots of superior flavors in all of the dishes that I have had. Doesnt matter if you order a pork dish, tacos, soup, whatever, it is all fun to eat. Just a delight."}
{"text":"I've been coming here faithfully since I was 17 (specifically for the late night specials) I am now over 21 but came here with some of my younger siblings after a movie. We all ordered from the late night menu, which immediately the waitress asked if we were all 21+. I have never ever been asked this question in the 5+ years I've been coming here, even when I was underage. I'm not retarded, I can read on the menu where it says \"21 and over\" BUT if you are going to have a rule, enforce it from day one..don't pick and choose days where you want to enforce your rules. I asked to speak to a manager on the matter and this new lady who I guess thinks she's the hbic was rude and other words I'll keep to myself. We called to file a formal complaint and the same sad excuse of a manager hung up on us. The food isn't worth ever coming back after being so mistreated. There's a cafe inside of the Orleans with the same price point and much better service."}
{"text":"We were staying in a nearby RV Resort and wanted to get a casual dinner and the South Point was convenient. We aren't gamblers so usually avoid most of the casinos due to the cigarette smoke. The smoke was pretty heavy at the South Point. The café is open on two sides so is a bit noisy and the smoke from the casino area gets in.  Wife ordered off the Chinese menu and really enjoyed her dinner. She said it was one of the best she had in a long time. I ordered spaghetti and it came in a brown very meaty gravy that was great. No red sauce if that matters to you. Dinner salad was crispy and cold with flavorful ranch dressing. The garlic bread that came with the spaghetti was pretty plain but I also got two rolls that came with the salad. Overall a good meal for a casino coffee shop."}
{"text":"Overpriced and terrible quality. The only thing that was good was the complimentary bread served before the meal. The chicken fingers were definitely straight from a Tyson frozen bag and their breakfast burrito was the worst thing I've tasted in a long time. It tasted like the kind of egg burrito you would make yourself at a complimentary hotel breakfast....powdered eggs and all. I would not recommend coming here unless you like poor quality food. You could get a much better meal waiting in line at the soup kitchen or school cafeteria. Honestly."}
{"text":"Bad service, ordered steak and eggs and had a tiny piece of bacon and I am severely allergic to bacon and who knew that steak and eggs had bacon in it. The waiter was named Jennifer and she was rude and the shift supervisor gave us a lecture on telling us what we could have done to avoid it like we're kids. She blame us and said it was basically our fault that we didn't tell them. And they brought out the new steak within 5 mins and the steak was very rare when we order medium steak. They need to know the customer is always right and the shift supervisor need to know how to treat a customer instead of lecturing us. Won't ever come back again!"}
{"text":"for $4 steak and eggs, and $3 biscuits and gravy you cant be picky on how good the food is BUT the steak was cooked well, eggs were good, hash brown could've been better though.  The biscuits and gravy were excellent!! will definitely go back"}
{"text":"If only I could be able to give half a star! Don't get me wrong customer service is beyond great. But the food has changed ALOT in a bad way I remember coming and eating here back when they first opened and the food was amazing I honestly don't know what happen."}
{"text":"My husband and I took a staycation at the South Point. About 1am, hunger struck and we went to Coronado Cafe for graveyard specials.   The restaurant was slammed but the staff handled it well. They were well organized and maintained smiles. Our server was a champ too. We were quite impressed. I had steak and eggs ($3.95), The husband had hamsteak and eggs ($2.95). No fuss, just cheap and quick. I've really missed graveyard specials. We used to take advantage of them every week our first couple year's of living here. Great option to curb late night hunger!"}
{"text":"Moderate food. The steak is pretty small, 7oz. They give a lot but it's just not as great you'd think it would be. However! They do have this daily special deal, $7.95, different meal choice for everyday. I'd come back for that."}
{"text":"Due to a very late arrival, I as planned arrived with my kids for my daughters graduation.  We got to South Point at 0100 hours, I was beat and starving.  Coronado was the only thing open.  Bearing in mind how horrible my last visit was, I bowed to kid pressure and we went in.  Other than having to wait for a table and the loudness of drunk casino eaters, the experience was very GOOD.  Our waiter Isturius (sp), from Los Angeles was fantastic, the food was PERFECT.   Total turnaround from last meal there.  Bravo.  Oh, and the mashed potatoes were fantastic !"}
{"text":"This review is only for the Coronado Café in the South Point Hotel which offers around-the -clock dining. For some time the restaurant has been promoting its $12.95 prime rib dinner as a \"House Special\".  This was hands down the WORST prime rib I have ever had. We came here on the recommendation of Anthony Curtis' Las Vegas Advisor website where it was described as a \"the big slab prime rib\". That was hardly a fitting description. The slice of prime rib I received was cut in a wedge shape. The wide edge was about  1/2\" thick and the opposite edge tapered down to zero. Nearly half of that was fat and gristle. What remained was simply flavorless. It came with a baked potato which was served lukewarm. The salad and rolls were okay but rather ordinary. Service was slow and we waited a very long time just to get menus before we could even order."}
{"text":"Reminds me of many of the restaurants in Albuquerque, NM. Old house converted into a restaurant with very cozy feel, great food and service. Really enjoyed the meatloaf - different flavor and presentation than most. I look forward to going back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch a couple of weeks ago and it was very good. I had a southwesternish omelet (including green chilies if I remember correctly) which came with big, herby breakfast potatoes, just how breakfast potatoes should be. I'm not a huge fan of melon balls but I was happy to see fruit come with the meal. The omelet was very good; I ate every last bite on the plate. $3 bloody marys and mimosas were what really won my heart. A great start to the day!! The service was also good; our waitress wasn't terribly friendly but the food came quickly and she kept the mimosas coming. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Some great late night/early morning specials. Midnight - 6 am. We had the steak and eggs and the cheeseburger. The food was solid for the price. The service was out of this world good. Bernadette was our server and she really took care of us. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"greatly pains me to do this, but this one star review is not tied to the food, but the lady that brings the coffee and water...she sat a coffee cup in front of me that was obviously used...it had the sip strip down the side, and drips else where...I called her back and said the cup was dirty..she told me that it wasn't dirty, that she must have bumped it while carrying it to the table...felt the cup, and the coffee stains were definitely dry...called her back again, and she asked if I would like a new cup...YA THINK! ..wow, that really fried me that she would even bring it in the first place, then try and lie her way out of replacing it...imagine the bacteria that could be on that cup, left by the former drinker....other than that the food was good as always, but this is a health hazard, and hope that management staff will cover this important issue with their coffee servers...."}
{"text":"Waffle looked and tasted like cardboard. Eggs and hash browns were mediocre. Our waiter also seemed like he didn't want to be there. Received better service from another waiter who was waiting tables near us."}
{"text":"Quality of service sucked, out of all the times ive been hear I've never been told no. But tonight i came in as a enthusiastic paying and tipping  customer and after purchasing 2 plates of food for myself, My friends  were denied (with a smile) from ordering more then 1 plate. When i waited tables i went the extra mile to make sure my guests were satisfied with they're service, which obviously wasnt a priority at this joint. I worked for tips guess they work for peanuts and are happy with it, or prejudging us because of race. stream-lining average food and complacent service will not have us returning. I won't be back hear and will spread the word about the average food and crappy service. This joint is below a Denny's service and-n-food wise!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the buffet before finding this place. Not going to the buffet anymore after visiting this place. Enjoyed the freshness of the food, the price, the service, and the overall ambience. This will be my go-to place whenever I stay at the hotel"}
{"text":"Question, isn't steak and eggs a necessity to do in Las Vegas?! Or to the people that live here and was born here, have you or have you not have steak and eggs with your parents after midnight?!"}
{"text":"Everything was fine had soup and salad came back to a table with all the food in their salad plate soup bowl empty bread basket looked like a huge mess we was gone for 2 min and they left everything on the table never coming and i ordered the chicken roma looked like somone threw up on my chicken and put rice on a plate nasty"}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly late night staff. Late night specials are priced right. Food quality is OK."}
{"text":"We visited the Coronado Cafe at Southpoint Casino and had one of the worst experiences for a meal ever.  The service was excellent but the kitchen failed miseqrably. The special porterhouse steak came over charred on the outside and blue on the inside. 2 burger dinners came too rare. The pastrami burger came with no pastrami and when  questioned the server said it was ground into the beef for the hamburger, which was quite tasteless and no pastami flavor . The fried rice was luke warm and the dried noodles served with it we're stale. Another diner had the sweet potato fries which weren't crispy or tasty. The meal was so bad that we didn't eat any more meals at the hotel. Sad when your there for three days."}
{"text":"Service was so slow. Took forever for food to come and when it did beyond horrible. Eggs dry, dirty plates, toast soggy from too much butter. Salad with wilted lettuce. Will never return again."}
{"text":"Why would you come here late at night? $3.95 steak and eggs? YES!!!   So cheap! Dirt cheap! Orange juice is only 20 cent cheaper to order.   I ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy! Steak was a fatty piece, eggs were cooked fine. Honestly, what am I doing? For $4 bucks, I have no complaints AT ALL.   The line is part of the price you pay though. It seems pretty crowded... but, it's off the strip so not as many people as there could be.   Otherwise, if I'm in the area... I'm coming here to get my after the club, drunken food fix!"}
{"text":"Great for late night eating. Cheap steak and eggs for 4.95. Pretty good size steak (7oz) for the price. Good graveyard specials. 4$ burger and fries. Fast and friendly service. Restaurant is clean. Would come again if in the area but not drive out of my way."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Late night specials are dirt cheap. Stays pretty busy.  I've stood in line many times. Service is good also."}
{"text":"One of the my favorite places to eat at for late nights. I love how cheap their steak and eggs are, you get way more than you pay for because they are actually pretty good. The service is also pretty fast, you don't have to wait long to be seated because the cafe is pretty big. The only thing that I wish they did were refills for their juice drinks. The juice are sometimes just as expensive as your meal but it will be in a really small glass (smaller than the water glasses) and they will charge you if you want refills. I wish that they would use bigger glasses. The only alcohol they serve is wine (really cheap wine). It would be better if they served beer as well, as it's a good combination with the steak. Try this place next time you're looking for a cheap place to eat at after midnight. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love, love, love, loved this place. We stopped on a Sunday afternoon, shortly after I stepped off the plane at Sky Harbor and was, of course, starving! I got a good eggs and bacon breakfast, my husband got a burger, perfect! We had the nutella crepes for dessert and, OH MY! they were so yummy. The service was very good, and they were very accommodating to our motorcycle helmets and my backpack from traveling. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Han and Eggs Special. I guess its the special so it won't be great. Ham is very tuff. My husband ordered steak eggs special medium rare. He got a well done steak. After 2 tries they finally got it right. I waited 5 minutes for ketchup. The worst experience.at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for their late night Steak & Eggs special.. It went up from 3.95 to 4.95! Waitresses were nice, there was no wait and you get a good amount of food. You basically get what you pay for though, quality was pretty bad but if I was drunk it probably would've been great."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. The food and service here always excels in every way. We have never been disappointed with anything we eaten here. A large variety to choose from, excellent portions and reasonable prices. Plus a nice selection of weekday specials. The Coronado burger would put some of the expensive burgers being sold on the strip to shame."}
{"text":"4 stars for the \"graveyard special\". I had steak n eggs steak was at least 8 oz and cooked perfectly rare, potatoes and sourdough toast. Double yum . available 11pm to 6 am.  1 star for a meal during regular hours. I ordered a Cobb salad. $12.95. Wasn't that good. Had to ask for crackers or bread. Tomatoes were watery, tasteless  iceberg lettuce, a disappointment."}
{"text":"pretty standard for this coffee shop dinner type place. Not bad. they did have a Chinese menu that looked good the next table over ordered it and it smelled good."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is for the Steak and Eggs Graveyard Special only. Price is cheap, but food is below average. MUST BE 21+!!!! My party of 6 got carded, each and everyone of us, Asian kids. Yes. I got carded to eat breakfast wtf.  The Graveyard Special are breakfast entrees for much cheaper prices from 12am-6am. Steak and Eggs (steggs as call by the locals) is $4.95, my coffee $2.95 =/  The service: The line is long. This is a popular steggs location. The service is friendly, but a bit disorganized. So 4 stars for service.  The food: Bleh. There were 6 of us. 6 orders of stegg medium rare. Steggs is 7oz new york steak, 2 eggs, a side of hash and toast. We received 6 different quality of steaks. 1 medium rare, 4 medium, 1 well, 1 almost rare. My steak was well and very dry. The eggs: I asked for scrambled and the waiter asked \" Do you want real eggs\". What there are fake eggs (probably egg substitutes and the like)? Real eggs scrambled = country scramble. The hash: very typical. A little bit crispy on top, but mostly mushy. The toast: I got sour dough and I thought it was the best part of the entree. I liked my coffee though, but I was just happy to have decent coffee. So 1 star for food.  The price is the only reason I ate here with friends. I personally would not bother coming back. There are a gazillion other Steggs places and places to eat after midnight in Vegas."}
{"text":"Casino resorts typically have one 24-hour cafe that serves the standard American diner fare.   The Coronado is that cafe for the South Point resort.   During a South Point stay in early May, we ended up at the Coronado three times.  Not because the quality of food was great, but rather because it was the path of least resistance whenever we wanted to eat quickly and somewhat inexpensive but still a sit-down meal.   For our three visits, while we were usually seated quickly, service thereafter was a mixed bag.   Sometimes our orders were taken promptly and the food soon came out, while another time we seemed to wait longer even though the place wasn't as crowded.    The dishes we chose did not all have the same level of quality to them.   A half Ham & Swiss sandwich was piled high with meat and was fairly tasty.   The \"George\" salad, however, was not good.   The choice of ingredients that comprised it did not seem to go well together, but worse would be the hard and unripe avocado slices that the evening's chef chose to serve it with.    For a breakfast meal, we split a Creole omelet, and that seemed OK.    Then on another dinner we tried the nightly special, which that evening was Salisbury Steak, and the Chicken Roma dish off the regular menu.   Both were decent.   The soups we had with the dinners were OK.   Nothing fantastic, but with exception of the salad we got, nothing horrible either.    Apparently this place offers a number of great breakfast deals from midnight to 5AM, so good that a nice-sized line can form of people wanting to get in when it begins.   Was never up late/early enough for that."}
{"text":"Their steak is not good at all. I ordered medium but it was so hard, its super well done. The mash potatoes is not good as well.   The service was ok. On time to refill our drinks and get our orders.  Definitely Wont come back here"}
{"text":"Ya' know, when I pay $35 for 1.5 greek salads and two pieces of cheese cake, I expect the lettuce to have some crunch and I want to receive both pieces of cheese cake.   So I tried a 2nd time thinking the first time was a fluke, but nope, the greek salad was still limp & soggy. And oh, the soup of the day with chicken was so gamey it tasted like canal fresh duck. Ugh.  No third tries for Coronado C."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place only twice but both times Ive sat outside cause the inside can get too cramped sometimes. However, dont let that push you away. The food is excellent and the service is quite nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the nice settings it brings. 4 out of 5 for the wait sometimes."}
{"text":"Expensive for mt ($15-$25 per plate at dinner)  BUT totally delicious-- and a super cute location.  I am not a burger kind of girl, but I had their burger with blue cheese and onions on it and it was cooked PERFECTLY (medium).  I mean, it was deeeeeelish!   They also have a (kind of) full bar, and specialty drinks that are mmmm mmmm good! plus a happy hour from 4-6p on weekdays (I think).   Would definitely recommend for a date night (not a first date, the tables are too close and your conversation too able to be overheard) or a girls night out!"}
{"text":"One of the restaurants that's in Southpoint that's open 24hrs along with graveyard specials"}
{"text":"Tuna sandwich: good. Late night breakfast: good. Wor Wonton: good.  Diner style menu with every different kind of food....but keep ot simple.   Eat here because you're hungry, in the SouthPoint, and the choices are limited overall."}
{"text":"Excellent 'Graveyard Specials' from $2-$5.   Always sit at the bar to avoid the long lines for a table.  Service from Carlos & Maria(?) the night of 10.7.17 was fantastic.  They were quick, honest about meals/drink recommendations, service & friendly.   Thanks for wonderful Biscuits & Gravy, Steak & Scrambled Eggs.  Love it for late night & honestly nothing beats the prices & amount of food at midnight on!"}
{"text":"used this as a dinner spot before heading to the symphony for a little opera and it was a perfect fit. we ate early enough to miss the crowd, place is a little cramped as noted in other reviews.  my gal and I are both vegetarians(most of the time, unless there is good eggs benedict) so we got the two veggie entrees -  Roasted Vegetable and Chevre Rellenos, shallot polenta, tomato reduction 13.5 Penne Pasta, green chile cream sauce, toasted pine nuts, parmesan 13. Both were friggin delish and wonderful and tasty and great and really really good.  service was slightly confused with who was working what area but other than that it was fast and accurate.  if you want to be romantic this is a great spot. watch out for the crowds and try to get a reservation. they wont do reservations after 6pm cause its their busy time."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the taxi driver (late night) special, so I take no responsibility if you go there before midnight and are completely disappointed. Just saying.  I don't live far from SouthPoint so it's nice to have a cheap place to go to late at night after the gym when you realize that your fridge is completely empty. Thus is the life of a bachelor. This place has by far some of the best late night specials in Vegas, and believe me, I have frequented several others and they can't really hold a candle at 2am to Coronado Cafe.  The wait staff is hit or miss, but with hefty portions at $1.45-$3.95, how can you really complain?  Here's a couple of tips:  1. If you order steak and eggs (and I really believe you should), be aware that they overcook the steak, so order it one degree more rare than you are accustomed to. Unless you like it overcooked.  2. There are no substitutions. Period, end of story. Fries instead of hash browns? Not going to happen. But thats okay, Just order the cheeseburger that comes with fries in addition to your steak in eggs. It's only $3! I tend to do this when I go with my bro and we split the burger and fries while each ordering steak and eggs.  3. Arrive between hours, like at the half. Avoid arriving at the top of the hour, for some reason the line tends to grow exponentially at 12, 1, and 2am. But if you arrive around 12:30, the line diminishes.  (I don't know why, but I am going to speculate that drunk people like to arrive closer to the top of the hour. Overcompensating )"}
{"text":"We were in town to see the Bishop Gorman vs. Findlay prep game and made our way here. We got the daily specials on Sunday turkey dinner and pasta dinner. Both were good and the price was reasonable.  The place was not too busy on a Sunday at 1pm.  The servers were polite and food was great. American within 10 minutes. The entire bill was just under $20 before tip.  On the way out of Vegas we made it back here to try the graveyard special. The food was great for the price and staff was great. No problems with the food. We both got the steak and eggs special for only 4.95. Our entire meal was a bit over $10 with taxes. Check out our photos for yourself.  Dora and pedro our servers were polite and helpful. Made pir return visit great! Came in on 3-12-17. Midnight special."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the worst.  Bad food. Bad customer service and yucky environment. I hate to be rude and I'm really trying hard not to be but overall this was just a terrible experience.  If it was up to me I wouldn't have eaten there to begin with but the people I was with were hungry.  I ordered a side of fries which was the smallest side of fries I've ever seen including fast food.  One of my friends ended up canceling his order because the server was rude.  Enough said.  I kind of feel like they don't care about reviews anyway.  Considering they will make their money regardless.  So consider this me helping you.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Love their graveyard specials I always go for their steak and eggs or 1/2 pound burger, great service very affordable and even if there is a long line, it moves very fast."}

{"text":"This little cafe has turned out to be one of my favorite places to grab a bite while in Phx. My first encounter a few months ago was on a whim. I was slightly hungry and just wanted something quick and healthy before I headed off to do my next massage. Well hello Coronado Cafe. I had been wanting to try this place but just kept passing it by. It is late afternoon and I walk up to the door and it is locked. Ohh well I thought I guess they close after lunch then reopen for dinner. I start to walk away and someone opens the door. The guy explains that they are indeed closed until dinner and would open in about 30 mins or so. Well I could not wait that long or I would be late for my next appointment. He says come on in anyway. What customer service! I just had a quick salad and it was wonderful. I really appreciated the guy doing that for me.   HINT TO RESTAURANT OWNERS: Customer service is key.   So I went back a few days later for brunch and had the friendliest waiter...Dan. He is great. I go in pretty regularly on Saturdays for brunch and for a great meal and a little chatting with Dan.  OK back to the food. My brunch consisted of the Crab Eggs Benedict, with a side of roasted potatoes and fruit salad. This is one of my FAVORITE meals ever. They get it right with the texture (big thing for me) and the flavors. They use foccacia bread instead of English muffins. The crab is lump crab meat with a few slices of avocado on top. The hollandaise sauce is creamy and light. Not too heavy. Sometimes this sauce can be made that weighs the dish down. Now I am personally taking a chance on eating eggs over easy but it is so good. I try to be aware of it but sometimes the eggs win and my tummy pays for it later :(  The Farm Salad is awesome. Salty, tangy goat cheese warm and gooey coated with nuts. The strawberries add a little sweetness. YUM YUM  The Portebello sandwich is another favorite. So you vegetarians won't be disappointed here.   I will say they charge $3 for iced tea. Now that is a bit much especially when you are using crappy Lipton tea. I am a tea lover and don't mind spending that kind of money on tea but it better be fresh tea leaves that I can get a few presses out of.  It is a small place so you will be in close proximity to other patrons. However, I have ended up in a few nice conversations with some very nice individuals. I sometimes come early for brunch and have a whole room to myself to eat, read and chat with my waiter extraordinaire Dan.  Lunch is usually packed here and the wait can be long so keep that in mind and try to go when you can have an executive lunch.  All in all I love CC. It is becoming the equivalent of my neighborhood diner. (All you NY'ers know what I am talking about) The place where you come in and everyone knows you and you have great meal with some great company. I never thought I could have the neighborhood diner experience here in AZ. But Coronado Cafe does just that."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here for dinner after watching a good show. While he ordered the Porterhouse Steak Medium Rare with Baked Potato ($14.95), I thought maybe I'll try the Vegetarian Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce ($11.25). We started with a nice Garden Salad ($3.95). Our server brought a plate of Fried Crispy Noodles with different sauces. I'm curious if these crispy noodles are meant to serve as a complimentary appetizer, or are they additional toppings for the Garden Salad.   By the time our meal arrived, I took one bite of the Vegetarian Chow Fun and I lost my appetite. I'm not sure if it's the Black Bean Sauce, or if the noodles are lacking flavor. I honestly don't know what it is. Personally, I think the Garden Salad taste way better than the Vegetarian Chow Fun. I ended up having most of my meal packed to-go and figured I try to remedy it at home. No doubt, the service is great but the food I ordered is not up to par with quality of taste. I think it needs adjustment. Maybe next time I'll order something that is more satisfying and close to comfort food."}
{"text":"As locals we come here all the time, they changed the policy on the late night specials meaning all of the people in your party have to be 21 or older to order off of the special menu. It's kinda sad, because being regulars they will loose not only our business but I'm sure others as well. I could've paid $3.95 for a cheeseburger but now I have to pay a double price of $8 and some change.  That's crazy, when the restaurant is empty!"}
{"text":"Cute! This place is like a little cottage set in the middle of the city. I was a little leery as we rolled into the parking lot because well, it was empty. When we got inside though, my worries quickly subsided. It was warm and cozy. We were quickly seated, given great customer service and most importantly served wonderful food!   Their Roasted Vegetable and Chevre Rellenos was sooo good! It was beautiful too, still mad that I didn't take a picture of it to share. Go to Coronado Cafe and order what I did, see for yourself. Not only was it beautiful it was delicious, the portion size was outrageous and it was only $15. Still drooling..."}
{"text":"Have never had anything else but Steak & Eggs at midnight for $4.95. I've had other ones in other casinos but I really just prefer it here.  --Medium steak comes out almost always medium. --Hashbrown is crispy goodness on the outside. --Eggs are.. well, eggs. --Wheat toast with creamy butter & grape jelly as dessert.  It's a total solid meal. I've never had the steak rubbery or tough. Service is never extremely bad. My water gets refilled constantly. Wait time is not annoying. Maybe I'm lucky or maybe I just have lower standards but I really like it here! :)"}
{"text":"This cafe is most known for their graveyard midnight specials. Ever since the ol gold coast closing their cafe down, and Orlean's stopped having a good deal, this is the place to go for their $3.95 Steak n Egg's deal !   Sometimes they are super busy, resulting in a long wait line. Sometimes you walk straight in. Depends on if there are any events or holidays or even weekends. I even had one experience where we came here late at night/early in the morning around 4-5am, on a memorial day weekend, and they ran out of steaks !   Due to their huge popularity of their midnight menu, their consistency ranges widely. If theres a lot of people, you have a fairly low chance in getting the correct cook temp on your steak. Being a guy who loves his medium rare steaks, you can't cook it for too long otherwise you'd go into the medium to medium well territory fairly easily. Huge cafe, tons of people, im pretty sure they don't have that many cooks doing the orders. Not easy to keep an eye on every single steak and pay attention to how through it has been cooked.   Aside from the 3.95 steak n eggs, there's also other items on the menu like biscuits & gravy, ham steak & eggs, eggs & bacon/sausage, for different prices (lower than steak n eggs i believe)   Steak & Eggs - $3.95 - 6 - 8oz ny strip with 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast.   Meat quality isnt the greatest. Definitely you get for what you pay but at 12am, there's almost no other deal that you can get.   As i had said before, i like my steaks medium rare, but also don't mind it being less than medium rare. So as one of my friends has taught me, i order RARE. Rare typically is a heat kissed steak with a cold, red center. Once in a while, i do get that, but usually the \"rare\" will end up in medium rare (pink, warm center) to medium (minimal pink) territory.   Aside from the steak, i order over-easy eggs and toast. Egg's are usually pretty spot on, in terms of cook, which is a good thing. I love a nice rich runny yolk with my toast.   Service wise, you'll have two people. One who takes your order, brings your food, and your receipt to take up to pay, then never see again.... Then the other, who does your drink orders and refills. You'll see the drink guy much more often than the actual waiter/waitress.   Overall, great place to get a midnight meal.   Note: you aren't limited to 1 order per person. if you ARE definitely hungry, you can order two and share or just eat both your self :P om nom nom !"}
{"text":"Ok. I am so full I can hardly write this review. We came in around 1 a.m. For the $3.95 steak and egg breakfast and just finished dessert. Blueberry pie a la mode was delish, as was the New York and the hash browns (something I usually have no problem leaving on the plate). There was pretty long line for this nightly 'Midnight Special' - about 30 minutes' wait - but the line kept moving, so it wasn't that bad.  But the real reason I want to write this review is for the service! It was outstanding. Both our server, Jeffrey (so friendly and energetic), and our busser, Erish, showed a great work ethic and were very attentive. I have long worked in food service, and if I had a restaurant, I'd hire them both!"}
{"text":"Came in at the perfect time. No line with a bunch of open tables. At the beginning, the servers were at the table ready to take an order. We ordered drinks and food and off she went. Food came about 15 minutes later which was not a big deal. At that time we requested salsa. No salsa came. In fact we didn't see her until 20 after everyone was done eating at the table. We had to ask a bus person to find our waiter. Had it not been for the food, this would have been a two rating."}
{"text":"I arrived into Las Vegas pretty late and stopped by the South Point to play some video poker while waiting for my friend to get off work.  After a few drinks and winning $40 I stopped by here after reading about their Graveyard Specials.  Grabbed the cheeseburger and fries for $3.75.  YUM!  I was impressed that they actually gave you a 1/2 pound patty!  Cooked to perfection, it was a great value and meal.  I could only eat half of it and took the rest back to my friends house.  If you are a local and live close by and get the munchies late at night, this is your spot to get some great food and not have to settle for fast food."}
{"text":"Usually always get good service from here. Wait staff is for the most part, very attentive. Food is good and decently priced. The porterhouse special is a good deal. $13 for a big, juicy steak, choice of potato, onion rings, choice of soup or salad and a slice of garlic bread.   Only complaint would be that I had to get my porterhouse sent back because it was undercooked. If you come for the graveyard special, be prepared to wait in a long line."}
{"text":"$3.95 for Steak n Eggs and crispy hash brown on the side?  I'm a fan.  Probably a Denny's quality steak but like $10 cheaper!  The line was long around 12:30am but got seated pretty quickly since the restaurants have many seating and people just eat and go.  Very far from the strip, but if you are already at Southpoint, try it out!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Coronado Cafe on Jan. 16th before heading over to the Dodge Theatre for the Kathy Griffin show.  Wanted to allow sufficient time so we arrived at 6:00, but as we pulled into the parking lot we weren't sure the place was open.  Hmmm....only one other car in the lot on a Saturday?  Are they open, are we too early?  What's up? Yes, they were open but only one other occupied table at that moment.  Were seated in the far back dining room, very cozy.    Oh and by the time we left (an hour later) the place had filled up with most tables occupied.  Let's get to the food - had the crabcake appetizer which was yummy, two small (very small) portions.  Which it had been bigger!  Loved the sauce and corn relish stuff on top.    I opted for the white meat pasta bolognese while my dining companion (my lovely daughter) decided on the meatloaf.  Both our portions were more than sufficient and both dishes were great.  Would not hesitate to order either again.    We opted to pass on dessert, but decided we would definitely return to the Coronado and bring our significant others with us."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The converted home gives it a nice touch, especially if you have a big group and get a whole room to yourselves.  They have a pretty extensive drink menu including some tasty microbrews.    My fiance and I had the vegetarian stuffed pepper served over polenta.  We had recently ate so we decided to split the dish.  Coronado Cafe charges a split plate fee, which usually bothers me, but this time it was perfect.  They basically made 2 dishes, there was so much food I couldn't possibly eat a whole order and the sauce was amazing.  Service was top notch as well.  I hope to go back to try their brunch on the weekend but for now, I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Still love the South Point. Still earns all five stars. But they did away with the Cowboy Omelette! Noooooooooo........  Oh well. Still many good items on the menu. There's a South of the Border Omelette I got in June 2013 instead. It's not the same but will have to do.  [sigh]"}
{"text":"Don't be deterred by the blah decor...Wonderful customer service. Delicious food. Two times in a row I've been impressed. First visit I had the chicken noodle soup and a patty melt with pepper jack cheese- YUM. The soup had a ton of chicken, not dried out. Plenty of noodles.  Second visit I had the wor won ton soup and it was GREAT. \"Wor\" meaning everything in Chinese (I consulted google for the definition before I decided to order it) which is exactly how I felt about it- it was everything! Definitely recommend going there. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great service. Ordered to 15 dollar special porterhouse steak. Wife ordered vegetarian lo mein.  Portions were huge and staff was pretty attentive. Furnishings could use some repair but not terrible"}
{"text":"Epitome of why small non chain restaurants are usually the best.  Atmosphere is great (inside a historic Phoenix house).  Service is really good.  Food is unique and offers great value with super fresh ingredients.   Overall, just a fun experience with great food."}
{"text":"What would I do without you! From long nights in college to early mornings out of work. This café has always been the go to spot for quick fulfilling inexpensive meal. I have come to this place hundreds of times and highly recommend it as your only night stop before you head home. The midnight special is the go to and I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Only came here because it was breakfast time in Vegas and I wanted lunch since I was still on New York time. Since I was alone, they had me sit at this awkward low counter squished between two other people.  I got my drink promptly but it took at least 15+ minutes for me to place my order. Once I placed my order the food came out super quickly. I got a wrap with fries and it wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't call it good either. Typical diner food...which I guess is not surprising considering they are always open with a full menu.  Once food is handed the server comes back one more time, asks if everything is ok and then quickly drops the check before you even really started your meal. Service wasn't good, food was standard diner food and I would not recommend unless it's your only option."}
{"text":"I had the turkey special. It was cold, the mashed potatoes didn't even taste like potatoes. I really didn't think you could ruin mashed potatoes but they did. The gravy was blah and tasted like it was out of a can. The sage dressing tasted ok, but it was like mush. The yams had maple syrup poured on them not glazed and the green beans (which were the only edible part of the meal) were cold and under cooked. My husband had the hot pastrami and he said it was the worst he ever had and didn't taste like pastrami. The other guest had the tempora shrimp & pot stickers and she said they were pretty bland. The whole thing was basically inedible. I think the breakfast might be alright, hard to ruin an egg but they might be able to. The service was fine. Friendly and attentive. Hence why I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"$3.95 NY steak and eggs with hash browns! from 12am - 6am only It was a good steak for the price... sooo cheap!  The mozarella sticks are kinda pricey and the red clam chowder was sour.  THIS PLACE IS WORTH A TRY FOR THE $3.95 STEAK!  DEFINITELY WILL GO BACK TO TAKE MY PARENTS."}
{"text":"Sooooo I get the price is 5$ for steak and eggs but it seems like the servers want to get you in and out of the place as quick as possible our server Carlos was the quickest person ever it seemed like he didn't even want us to be there. As soon as we got our food he gave us our receipt. Asked him about cream soup and he forgot until I had to remind him then made up some stuff about it being freshly made lol just say you forgot, other then that the food was bomb and for the price i can't ask for more. O and he didn't say his name I had to look at his name in the bill lol isint  that serving 101 lol"}
{"text":"Came here early for breakfast at 3 am. This is my 500 review. I came here hungry.   As we got in line to be seated, the place was packed with the young crowd at 3 am. We got seated right away at a booth that was clean. Good thing the waitress gave us a clean booth.   They have grave yard specials. Hubby orders us two steak and egg breakfasts which comes with steak, eggs, hash browns and choice of toast. I got my steak medium well, eggs over easy with wheat toast. That special costs $4.95. That is the cheapest steak and egg breakfast you can find in Vegas. It is inside South Point hotel which is off the 15 freeway.   Steak and eggs were delicious. Hash browns were cooked perfect. Steak was tender, and eggs and wheat toast were good. Our waters were refilled immediately as they were half empty. The waiters kept checking up on us. I like the great customer service here. You don't need a club card, but must be over 21 to get the grave yard specials. Good deal! Plenty of tables here, so the lines go quickly. I definitely would come back here for breakfast. If you are in Vegas, check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse every time I stay at southpoint. Both times for breakfast , Had waffles once, and hot cakes the other time. They must add elastic to the batter , so rubbery . And as in the photo, bacon was greasy and under cooked.same horrible bacon as the buffet at Southpoint. Do your self a favor if your staying here, go to the Del Mar deli ."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Huge pancakes! Very good food and good service."}
{"text":"Ok,  The Cab Driver Special!  Get one of each and a cab ride home!  I love this place after midnight!"}
{"text":"I love the Coronado Cafe.  They offer fresh ingredients and a seasonal menu.  The service is phenomenal.  I was but a lonely two top in a sea of large parties, but was paid attention to nonetheless.  My buddy and I made many substitutions and our order came out perfectly; our check was below forty dollars, cocktails included.  I wish I lived closer by because I'd be there every Saturday when I wake up in dire need of eggs and cocktails."}
{"text":"Ah yes, the famous $4 steak and eggs sometimes referred to as \"steggs\". Maybe it's my fault for not ordering the steggs but really at 1am my body was not feeling like steak. It just wanted fries... lots of fries!  I went with a large group 10+ people, and we waited in line outside to get seated. We played games so time passed by quickly (although in reality I think we waited around 30 minutes). After getting seated we ordered our drinks. I had a shirley temple. It didn't really taste like a shirley temple (not enough grenadine) but whatever I dealt with it because I knew that soon I would be eating fries!  I split a cheeseburger and fries with one of my friends.  The burger meat tasted a little off. It wasn't gamey but it tasted sort of like paper? I didn't finish my half of the burger because the texture and taste was so off that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The fries were alright, definitely not crispy enough but at least they provided us with ketchup, mayo, and some sort of thousand island dip!  Honestly if I lived in Vegas I could see this as a great place to hang out with friends. The food is really less than average but it's affordable in a relatively expensive city and it's open late! However I wouldn't exactly put this on my to-do list if you're visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This is a great place inside the South Point Hotel and Casino. The service was fast and super friendly. The food and prices were great. They have great deals for late night eaters."}
{"text":"So I only come here for steak n eggs and there's really not much to say about it except that its a piece of steak with some eggs, potatoes, and toast all for $4. They do have other midnight specials such as a cheeseburger with fries, ham steak and eggs, and even pancakes. Really good deal for what you're getting. Just a note, they are starting to check for IDs to make sure you're 21."}
{"text":"I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but bumping it up for the efficient service.  I stayed at South Point and was looking for a place to dine alone that wasn't too frou frou and wanted to get out fairly quickly, and Coronado Cafe fit the bill.  I sat at the counter and was immediately provided a glass of water and a menu.  Someone else came to take my order shortly thereafter.  I had the prime rib with potato and a salad for about $13, plus a glass of red wine.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was good and quite filling.  There were two people working the counter, which I was impressed with - they were great at making sure everyone was taken care of."}
{"text":"4.99 steak and eggs after midnight... must I say more?  Perfect ender to a sad night of losing all your money. Trust."}
{"text":"So my sweetheart and I came here after a negative experience at Nami across the street.    I ordered an Iced tea and the crabby benedict.  The iced tea was a fruity tea and very yummy.   Now the crabby benedict. Never before have I tasted such unique flavor combinations. The bread they served it on was a flavorful focaccia bread. The eggs were very nicely poached. Just instead of ham they put a crab cake on it! (I love crab!)  The service was very friendly and he had an excellent personality.   Next time I'll have to come back and try the dinner menu. It looked incredible."}
{"text":"After 6am prices run $13 for breakfast, totally not worth the price. We come back here every year and the prices have steadily increased till they have priced themselves out of two more people opting out of eating on site. We found out that the breakfast specials are for the midnight and not in the morning.  We got out of line and went to Carl's Jr for about 1/4 of the price."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I was greeted when I came in the door.  I was allowed to pick my seat, inside or out.  I asked for a specific table- NO PROBLEM!!!! The waitress, Beth, was so nice and informative.   I ordered dessert first....Chocolate cake-yum!  For dinner, the Blue Cheese Burger and Mac-n-cheese.   As you can see from the pics, hot and juicy.  I almost got the steak but I'll save that for another time because I will be back, w/friends!"}
{"text":"3.75/5 Great food service can be hit or miss They're have been multiple $ increases but it's still a bargain!  Chinese menu is actually some of The best in the valley!  Breakfast is great ! Word of advice: if it's rodeo season the whole place smells like a farm..."}
{"text":"I was there last night, two words - CHOCOLATE CAKE! Try it. The cream cheese frosting was an awesome touch with the wonderfully moist cake."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but most recently the other day.  Taking Mona's suggestion - I had the andouille sausage linguine and it was decent.  My friend had the flank steak that I wish I had ordered.  It was cooked to perfection and rested in a blackberry mole reduction.  On previous visits, I've had the atlantic salmon and vegetable lasagna - both great choices.  The service is usually good, except this time I felt the server was either overly attentive - borderline rushing us....but it wasn't a big deal.  The environs are terrific - white tablecloths with kitschy cute 1940s classroom chairs.  Weird touch, but retro cool.  A recommended central Phoenix favorite.  UPDATE - 1/25/07 The hostess was very gracious and accommodating checking on us every so often as we had drinks and waited for our table.  The owner came out and chatted with us after the meal to make sure everything we great, and even went back to the chef to clarify ingredients for me, plus added a little back story on the halibut sandwich w / german potato salad.  Definitely a friendly, homey atmosphere.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Met friends here for reunion lunch,  needed a table for 15.  The staff gave us a great table without a long wait.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  Going back this weekend for their $14. 95 steak special with friends."}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe is one of the things I miss most about living in the Coronado Historic District in downtown Phoenix. It's a quaint little bungalow converted into an adorable cafe with simple day fare such as yummy lunchtime salads and sandwiches, great weekend brunches (mmmm crab benedict), and some decent dinner options as well. They have an okay wine list and a great staff, but I think what I really liked about it was the very mellow, cozy feel and it's atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner on Saturday, and loved it. Service was top notch, atmosphere was comfortable and quaint, without being cute. The food was delicious and well executed. Since it was happy hour, the drinks were $2 off too.  We started with the indecision bruscetta. It's a plate of two each of their three varieties. I tried the goat cheese and the gorgonzola ones. Both were quite tasty, and a perfect start to the meal. Though the pine nuts kept falling off of the gorgonzola one. I also have a glass of a lovely Chilean cab.  I ordered the halibut tacos. I had been craving a grilled fish taco, and was stoked they had them on the menu. The halibut was tasty and delicate, topped with an almost too mild chipotle slaw, nestled in grilled flour tortillas. I felt it needed a little something, so I added a squeeze of lime, and a touch of salt.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee. The texture was the perfect combination of creamy and firm, and it was swimming with the tiny grains of vanilla bean.  Dinner was also reasonably priced. For a party of five, our bill was about $150 for one app, one salad, five entrees, one wine, three cocktails, and two desserts.  I would go back in a heatbeat."}
{"text":"Every casino has a 24 hour diner, this is South Point's. Lines move fast, food comes out fast, tables are turned over fast. As at similar places, the specials are generally your best bet. Daily lunch/dinner specials are a great value, good portion size with fresh food, $10 or less. But you can't really go wrong with breakfast. The \"side\" of biscuits and sausage gravy is hearty enough to be a portion. Omelets are standard but solid, easy go-to option if you're feeling indecisive."}
{"text":"Cheap, decent, workman-like meals. Go in expecting a diner serving diner food and you will be satisfied. The service is decent, the food is decent and the price (especially for its proximity to the Strip) is great.  Don't let the 3 stars fool you. It truly is A-OK."}
{"text":"Came here after midnight for the late night specials. We waited 45minutes to be sat. There were a lot of others waiting as well, place seemed to be very busy. Upon being sat we noticed empty tables everywhere and more than enough servers to cover all the sections.   Ordered biscuits and gravy, cheeseburger, and the steak with eggs and hashbrowns and a slice of cheesecake. Hard to complain about for a total of $17. However, we had to wait another 35minutes for the food.   Our server never acknowledged us. A different server took our food order. Another server brought us our drinks. Our server dropped off our food and walked away without saying or asking if we needed anything. The burger was ice cold, the fries undercooked. The steak which I asked for to be cooked medium-rare resembled a piece of charcoal. I still ate it because it was 2am and what else was I going to do? Actually we didn't eat the fries. Absolutely disgusting. Actually saw another table ask for the fries to be cooked longer so not an isolated incident.  Our server never brought the cheesecake out and actually had the audacity to drop our check off still without saying a word to us!   I counted that he had two other tables aside from ours, so in my opinion... completely inexcusable. For better service and better late night food specials visit Sundance Grill at the Silverton."}
{"text":"Great little cafe in central Phoenix. Great food and adorable location! Better for lunch than dinner I think."}
{"text":"Costly for the food you get. If you go after midnight you get VERY good prices. If you go before hand, you're paying a lot. We ended up getting a waffle, a parfait (which was large but mushy), a side of bacon and a horribly made chicken sandwich. We ended up paying about $35! The waffle was the only good thing out of the dish. I honestly wouldn't complain if I went during their snack hours where you can get a steal on the food...maybe someone else will have better luck. The waiter/waitresses seemed clueless half the time and there was only one size to-go container. I felt very annoyed and inconvenienced going there."}
{"text":"Real Good Service.  Food tasty and the cafe is clean."}
{"text":"What can I say....all of the 2 star reviews below me were unfortunatly true.  We were able to get in without a reservation, (did not realize it was so tiny ahead of time....) atmosphere was awesome.  Food was okay, girly drinks knocked our socks off.  Pricey.  And finally, food poisoning.    Yes my friend, end of story.    Cute enough to check out yourself.  Dont go if burning $50 would be a horriable loss to your bank account."}
{"text":"We were in South Point Hotel to get tickets for a show. The line was kind of long so we felt it would go for some brunch and wait for the line to go away. Excellent choice! It turns out 11:30 is a good time to show up at the cafe. The breakfast crowd is gone and the lunch crowd hasn't gotten there yet. I ordered the Creole omelette. It's a 3 egg omelette stuffed with sausage and shrimp and other goodies and Creole sauce on the side. Yummmm! This was really good. Comes with a side of hash browns and toast - I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"I have been going to this cafe for the past 5 years. The other day was the first time I had been there in a year and it was horrible. The waiter delivered our food and never returned to give us refills or ask if we needed anything. The biscuits and sausage gravy were horrible. The biscuits might as well be hockey pucks. I could barely get the fork in the biscuit to cut it in half.  And then when it was time to go and my friend wanted to box the rest of his meal up, we had to find a bus boy to bring a box.  Unfortunately, all the bus boy did was tell our waiter we needed a box. The waiter carried the to-go box  to us and handed it to my friend without ever looking at him and then he walked away. It was the worst service I have ever had and will probably not go back even though I absolutely love the gravy to the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"In search for late night prime rib, my friend who lives in Vegas brought us here. It was only $15. The place reaked of horses but it wasn't bad enough for us to leave. It was a good deal. The meal comes with soup or salad and your choice of potatoes. We all ordered it medium rare but was served a more rare one instead.  When we sent it back, they gave us a new one cooked to our liking. That was awesome customer service!  Although it was slightly chewy, the flavor and crust was really good! 3.5 stars total and yes I would probably come back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, my server seemed like I was inconveniencing her with my order. The food was less than average and grossly overpriced. I hoped it was a fluke, so I went a second time and the people behind me in line were seated before me and my meal took an absurd amount of time to be served. I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Can't really complain about its midnight value. For $3.95, you get a steak cooked to whichever context you'd like, hash browns, two eggs, and two toast! The midnight happy hour menu deal goes on everyday from 12AM - 6AM. It's a bang for the buck. The quality is nothing to rave about since it's not like you're paying double digits. However, outside the discount, this food can be quite pricey for its quality.  Service is above average. Because these midnight hours are the busiest, they tend to be inconsistent but as a man of value, I'll never argue with this value."}
{"text":"We had excellent food and excellent service each time we visited this cafe. The first time, my blueberry pancakes were raw in the middle. I sent it back, but the rest of my party was finished eating by the time my fresh pancakes arrived, so the manager removed my meal from the bill. Now that's customer service! After that positive experience, we ate there two more times over the course of our week at South Point. The cafe has great variety and the food is good, and the servers were very attentive. I'd recommend it over the hotel's buffet any day!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Subpar service. No wonder it's off the strip. I'm really bummed that I wasted my calories and money on this food. My wife was equally disappointed. We were also with two friends. She ordered the Caesar salad with chicken. Yup. Didn't eat the chicken. It was dry. My buddy was ordering and was so irritated with the server's attitude he cancelled his order!! We probably all should have cancelled and left at that point. But unfortunately we did not.  Steak and Shake would have filled our cravings."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but I love breakfast at night! I mean come on... Everything in Vegas is much better at night. This cafe has priceless graveyard specials. I come here for the steak and eggs. The idea of steak & eggs is genius for a midnight meal. It's like the last of dinner and the beginning of breakfast. Yeah, yeah call that a \"tina-moment\" but you know you're still thinking about it.  I've heard some say that the steak is alright... Well, if you haven't yet, I suggest ordering it MEDIUM. Not medium rare or medium well. just straight MEDIUM and it should be perfect. Perfect for $3.95.  I'd say the vibe is much better than any other place I've gone for some graveyard specials. It's crazy how people are still up at 3am craving some steaks! It's definitely safer than sleeping pills, I think.  Anyway, take my word. And when you get the steak&eggs.. mix it all up. I usually don't like my food mixing, but breakfast is the only exception, like paramore.  Oh and one last thing.. If you're not a steak&egg person.. They have other specials, like pancakes and stuff. Ugh, just writing this review makes me wish it was midnight already so I can get some now."}
{"text":"First of all...great price! Next, the size! What a volume the plate/bowl. They have american, asian...any kind of food and open late!(24H?)"}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe is one of the last restaurants to have a decent graveyard special.  Yeah 5, 6, 7 bucks is cheap for steak and eggs.  But $3.95 is better!  And it lies within South Point Casino & Hotel.  I ate here just recently, maybe last week? And before that was probably about 3 years ago.  You would think the prices would change over a span of three years right? WRONG!  Coronado Cafe, old Vegas graveyard prices staying true to it's roots."}
{"text":"So-so casino food.  Don't forget to request cheese if you order an omelet, because they apparently only include cheese if requested.  My wife ordered a Denver omelet and it didn't have any cheese in it.  We thought that was kind of weird!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Love the martini. The women were so helpful. Cite place!"}
{"text":"It is a diner in an off-strip casino. I had breakfast. It was ok and the price was decent except the coffee. It was as much as the eggs almost!  You can smell the equestrian center from the line for the cafe but once inside I couldn't smell it anymore. Decent on-site option for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Been their a lot. Have always liked everything from the burger to the great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed eating at this establishment. The amount of staff they had on hand kind of confused me until about 20 minutes in they started getting more and more patrons then it became self explanatory."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality of the food. Fish and Chips on the menu were $16.95!! We thought, they must be good at that price. We were wrong!!  The salad that came with the meal looked as though it had sat out in the heat for some time. Lettuce was wilty and warm. The salad was Soggy. The fish looked as though it came from a frozen box container and microwaved to heat it up. Then it was plopped over a bed of french fries. Was not plated well at all. Tarter sauce was served on a seperate plate in plastic cups. The overall menu here looks way over priced for the quality of the food. You would and should expect more!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for the Graveyard Specials!! This being 3am in the morning :) We were seated right away and they were not that busy. The staff was really nice and always made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the Pancake sandwich (Buttermilk pancake, ham steak and egg). Well I got 2 pancakes, 1 fried egg and ham lunchmeat heated up!! So that is not a Ham Steak!! But it was only $3.75 I believe. It tasted ok. My husband ordered the 7oz NY steak, eggs, hash browns and toast for $3.95. He ordered his steak medium and it was well done. So he said it was tough to chew otherwise it was ok. This café is open 24/7. I do say at least the staff was very nice and the place was clean. We will go back but, when and time frame who knows :)"}
{"text":"South Point knows what they're doing with cheap after midnight specials on bowling, one dollar tap beer and one dollar well drinks, To make it even better Coronado Cafe offers 3.95 Steak and Eggs  The only reason i go here is for the steak and eggs and when i do it's usually between the hours of 12:00am to 05:00am.  True the slice of NY is on the thin side, the hash brown is quite greasy and often flavorless, and the eggs are also a bit on the greasy side. Who cares? It's really really early in the morning and here's cheap steak and eggs to help sober you up for the drive home.  Only issue is the South Point may be far for some and is off the beaten path in regards to the strip. It's location may be an inconvenience but with proper planning a lot of fun could happen at the South Point and continue right to Coronado Cafe before festivities end for the day"}
{"text":"its okay. but, WHERE'S MY CHECK?? are they giving free meals to random people? man it took 5 minutes for them to find us a seat. about 15 minutes for the food. 20 minutes to eat. and waiting forever for the check. wtf? free meal? let us know so that we can leave asap."}
{"text":"5 stars for: creativity in food/taste combinations, ambiance (excellent musical choices, artwork), service. The first thing the waiter did was adjust our table (it was a little wobbly), then dim the lights out a little. He gave us his honest opinions, gave us enough space. We ate he crabcakes, the meatloaf, the rellenos and farm salad. All were delicious with unique flavor combinations. Oh...I almost forgot. It was my husband's birthday and the waiter added a little candle to this heavenly chocolate cake. Perfect evening. Highly recommend-and we are from San Francisco where we unfortunately become restaurant/taste snobs!"}
{"text":"I was excited to give this place a try one night. I ordered beef chow fun off the Chinese Menu and others in my party tried their burgers and ham dishes. Beware, the portions are huge, so sharing is a great idea. The food was served in such unbelievably large servings that the quality of the food was not good at all. The beef in the dish that I ordered was way too chewy. The rest of my party also had negative thoughts about the dishes they ordered as well.  The next day, we decided to give this place a second chance, and so we came for the Graveyard Breakfast Special. The same issue occurred, being the portions large but the food quality terrible. On a positive note, honestly, I must give Coronado Cafe 2 starts because the service of terrific, friendly, and kind. However, there are so many restaurants in Vegas to try and so little time, and I recommend you skip this one and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Longtime fan of the $4.95 graveyard steak-and-eggs special. You might expect a pretty gnarly steak for the price, but nope - it's a lean, tasty, nicely charred filet (I like it medium rare; outside is charred, inside is usually the proper reddish-pink) that IMVHO is better quality than the $14.95 porterhouse. The rest - two eggs, hash browns, toast - is cooked to taste. Eggs have great buttery flavor. South Point is always a better value in every way than anything on the main Strip, and the cafe is no exception."}
{"text":"Late night eats!  It's not the best.. but it's like, the cafe you need after sitting and gambling for HOURS and drinking toooo much beer.  During certain hours of the day you can find a line forming out the entrance.... but they seat fairly quickly.   It's a big space w/ lots to seat and lots or wait staff.   Have never encountered any rudeness or anyone who was impolite.... and service is alright!  I mean, nothing special or anything, they have to serve sooo many people but it's not like they are over extending the staff or anything.   It's run pretty well!  The menu is super split.  American breakfasts, lunch, and dinners.. and Chinese!  It's located at the Southpoint Casino right smack dab in the middle.  Anyway!  Late night eats.. you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3.5 and 4 stores, but figured I'd bump it up a bit since service was so great. I came here for a lunch date with a friend and was pleased at the adorable cottage with ample outdoor seating. All the staff was very friendly and eager to please. We ordered the goat cheese bruschetta, the crab cake open sandwich and the chicken pesto sandwich.  I certainly enjoyed everything we tried but there weren't any flavors that blew me away. The goat cheese bruschetta was certainly delicious but maybe I'm spoiled with bruschetta after a few trips to Postino. I loved the outdoor patio, perfect for a warm, sunny day.  All in all, I enjoyed my time at Cordonado Cafe but felt I was paying a little too much for the food I was getting. I'd love to go back during the night time to get a romantic table and bottle of wine outside."}
{"text":"Just went here last night for the first time after a visit to the museum, and it was everything I had heard and more - i was not disappointed.  beautiful historic home turned upscale-casual restaurant, in the style of Coup de Tartes or House of Tricks. It was relatively busy, but we were sat right away.  Mom had the BBQ chicken, BF had pork tenderloin (I'm not a pork fan usually, but this was melt in your mouth delicious and not overly salty at all) and i had the meatloaf entree (not sandwich, as advised by the young and very pleasant server).  we were all very pleased with our orders and service was prompt, professional and pleasant. the woman dining next to us came as a recommendation while in town from the owner and chef's cousin. she asked the server to let him know she was here so she could meet him and say hi, and after the crowd died down a bit, he did and seemed like super cool, down to earth guy.  i overheard him mention his \"other restaurant\" so on our way out i asked him about it. he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about). i will be heading there on my next dining adventure.  dinner entrees were priced between $15 to $25, cheapest glass of wine was $6 (not bad, the food was couturely presented and tasty).  p.s. the parking lot was a nightmare... all dirt and full of HUGE pits and deep tire tracks, but wouldn;t stop me from returning"}
{"text":"Like most people, I dragged my tired butt in here for the late night specials.   FOOD Our steak was dry and was begging to drown in BBQ sauce (luckily provided by our server) while the eggs were simple and just boasted their own egg-y flavor. My own burger and fries weren't time-stopping, but at least they weren't barf-inducing (plus came with fairly crisp lettuce and tomato). It was a welcome salty and hot food to my tired self.  SERVICE The staff was continually running around and took our orders, delivered our food, and gave refills all in a timely manner. Very business-like yet friendly--even in the wee AM hours."}
{"text":"This place is so cute. Food is delicious. Good for brunch. $3 mimosas. Also good for dinner. Crab cakes are amazing, and what they're known for."}
{"text":"My wife and I brought our young son here for an early dinner; we thought we'd go somewhere different.  We weren't impressed.  We waited a while to be acknowledged and seated while half a dozen employees sat at a nearby bar folding napkins.  Our waitress barely spoke English and we had to constantly repeat ourselves.  The child's menu was small and very limited.  We ordered a milk with our son's meal and they charged us $3 for a glass.  $3???  Really????  The food had no flavor.  The portions were okay sized.  The water tasted like dirty city tap water.    While we were eating someone's fish dinner was served.  The smell of the fish was so strong and nasty (and I like fish) I thought one of the elderly women in the both next to us crapped her pants!  Seriously.  My wife is pregnant and her sense of smell is increased right now.  The smell made her sick to her stomach and she couldn't finish her meal.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Best crab cake in town? Close second to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse--this is a fantastic little restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Love the family-owned feel."}
{"text":"Their chocolate chip waffle does not have actual chocolate chips in it but instead has a subtle chocolate flavor. Considering the waffle costs $8 this is not exactly a fair price which I expect when it comes to a casino but it's very misleading that it is advertised as chocolate chip when it is really just somewhat-chocolate flavored."}
{"text":"OK, I didn't want to go here. I wanted to go to the buffet, but there were 100 people or so in line, so we went to the house cafe and I was bummed. The service wasn't so great and the fish and chips I ordered was Generic City. I filled up on an appetizer of nachos with beef and it wasn't too bad, but the entree kind of sucked. Where the heck is the coffee I asked for and they brought me a pot of coffee - only after they used some of it to refill somebody else's cup. Yuck."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, since they have meals as low as $3.95 (for their late night special), but we ended up having a really crappy dining experience here. I'll get straight to the point, the waiter/waitress service here is TERRIBLE! My boyfriend and I saw our waitress a grand total of 3 times during our entire dining experience there. When she initially approached us to take our orders, she was giving us attitude and actively rolling her eyes at us while we ordered. I can understand if you're having a bad day, but why take it out on customers (who will give you the opportunity to make some extra cash through tips)? After she dropped off our food, she returned shortly after to hand us the bill and left. Luckily the restaurant's busboy was there to help take care of us. He was actually the one that brought us our drinks and checked up on us periodically if we needed refills or anything else. We ended up giving him a tip instead of our waitress, for obvious reasons.  For $3.95 (or $4.95 for the steak breakfast) they do give you a good amount of food. I was honestly anticipating smaller portions since the price was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised. As for the taste factor, the food was fairly average to me. My fries were cold and limp and my cheeseburger was very bland. I didn't have any of my boyfriend's steak breakfast, but he said his was pretty good.  Overall, the food here is average and the service is horrible. I'm sure other waiters and waitress that work here aren't terrible as the one we had, but lucky for us we got the queen of terrible. Honestly, this is the perfect place to go to when you are drunk and want something cheap to eat ('cuz let's face it, everything tastes better when you're drunk). 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend for the Midnight Specials this restaurant had to offer around 2 AM. There are awesome deals like a 7 oz. NY steak with hash browns and eggs and burger with fries for about $3.75, but the customer service we had was garbage. Although the line was about a 10-15 minute wait we were seated immediately. It was pretty busy, but what made very frustrated was we waited about a good 15 minutes for our server to take orders while other parties after us got their food and drinks within the first few minutes they sat down. To add on top of that, while the other parties after us got their food quickly we waited more than 30 minutes for our New York Steak. Take note that those other parties that came after us had about two-eight people, and they got their food within 15-20 minutes. Wow! When we finally got our food our server tried being extra nice and constantly checked up on us, but that sugar coating didn't fly with me, and the funny thing is our check came a lot faster than our food did. Food was okay, but I didn't like how our server kept us waiting while the other servers brought out their parties' food more quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"The hostess, and busser were great, in fact it was the  busser's attentive drink refill service that saved this place from losing another star... the food server was not so great, and the food was awful!  I would actually give the food 1 star, and the food server 2 stars. The menu prices are fair, but the variety of menu options could better. I was thoroughly disappointed, and I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great customer service.  Owners are very supportive of the community."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but my experience here was great! Came here after a long night of gambling, and the late night specials were available at such cheap prices. I ordered a burger for $3.95 and it was delicious, especially for its price. The service was also really good and I don't have any complaints. I guess I'd need to come here a few more times to get a more accurate feel for this place, but for now they are 5 stars in my book and I definitely plan on coming back when I'm in town again"}
{"text":"I was excited to get a group of 5 great friends together for a light brunch and several rounds of bloody Mary's. My excitement did not last long. The bloody Mary was so bland, it tasted like plain tomato juice with black pepper... However, this was not the worst part, that was they way my crepe tasted. I'm a lover of crepes. I learned how to make them as a child and they're my Go-To brunch indulgence. Now when you eat something that you love and you're confidant that you have healthy taste buds, you get very disappointed when your food tastes bad. Where I was hoping to find a delicious nutella and banana flavor, I was taken aback by the overwhelming taste of oil. Not delicious.   Chefs can have an off day and food can turn, I get it. I don't get how a Server can then attempt to make a customer feel guilty or stupid if they send the plate back. I've worked in the service industry for many years and sending food back, gives the restaurant a chance to turn your experience around. If you messed up once, it's totally forgivable, however if you then give a crappy response to the customer, you're officially a sucky server.   Bummed that I had such a poor experience at this cute little neighborhood eatery and even more bummed that I didn't get to enjoy a tasty crepe.   Crepe-lessly yours,  Joan"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, we dined at this restaurant recently on a double date. The building itself is adorable. Maybe used to be an old house? It's cozy and you feel like you will be served some home cookin' with a twist. Our appetizer of spinach artichoke dip was delicious but the meal declined after the beginning. My husband and I both ordered the chile relleno. The description looked fantastic but the polenta was bland and the chile itself (for not being heavily fried) was very greasy and left me wanting. One of our friends ordered the crab cakes which he described as fine.   Toward the end of our meal, a gnat was discovered floating in a Manhattan at our table. Our server was notified, she took the drink away after asking if our friend wanted a replacement (he declined) and we waited for our check. The drink was still included on the check and the waitress seemed a bit surprised when he asked for it to be removed.   I think the reason I was so disheartened about this experience was we still ended up paying about $70 for our meal (just for myself and my hubs.) Unfortunately, Coronado is not worth the food, price or overall experience."}
{"text":"Best place for $4.95 Steak and Eggs!  We only come here for the midnight specials! This if our favorite cheap late night meal! I go for the Steak and Eggs everytime! Sometimes I don't just order one but two! We usually order the $4 cheeseburger and take it to-go with us. The only way you lose is if you gamble and lose. Other than that, you always come out a winner!"}
{"text":"Thank you yet again Yelp, for hooking me up with this excellent restaurant. Coronado Cafe is absolutely the definition of quaint. Built inside a humble, antiquated house, and populated with both an excellent selection of wine and beers, Coronado Cafe makes for a great spot for a surprise weekend date.   Making it there just 30 minutes before close, I was a bit worried we'd miss out on the freshest food, or the best recommendations. I was wrong on both accounts. When our very friendly waiter came around, he offered the crusted rock fish as a special. Although many other items looked tantalizing on the menu, both the lady and I jumped on the opportunity.   The fish came out perfect, with just the right amount of crunch, and being cooked well enough to have no questions it was done without drying it out. The rice and mashed potatoes served with it complimented it perfectly.   All in all it was a wonderful experience. I am glad that Yelp has made this place accessible to people who don't live in the area!"}
{"text":"So prices have gone up since my original post which is expected but the food is still a great value! For some reason the food comes out faster... Must already have steaks ready and just quickly prep them to go out. What's weird is they ask everyone now if they have food allergies!? Why?"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on June 8th for steak and eggs around 4:30am before heading to California for my birthday weekend. I don't usually give reviews for steggs since we've been here multiple times and expect an average service, but I just needed to applaud our server Nathan from Puerto Rico (that's what his name tag read). We have been here for many years now just for their steggs, but never have I received such an awesome service during a graveyard shift. I'm not exaggerating when I say that he was full of energy and made us all laugh. He presented himself with an aura that made you want to ask for him again next time we visit. The service itself made our dining experience at this establishment  wonderful. The food was prepared properly since it wasn't too busy.. it seemed the cooks were able to really cook my friends' steaks to their liking.  Thank you Nathan for the excellent service. Keep up the great work and never lose such an eccentric personality!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little place. The food is excellent as is the service. We shared a blue burger and a piece of chocolate cake. The burger was awesome and on a fresh baked bun. The chocolate cake came from Shelly's Specialty Desserts in Glendale AZ. It was so moist and delicious.  I would recommend reservations since the place us so small.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to go higher, but truth is, this place is a mixed bag.  Customer service, pretty good, food, eh.   I stopped in late night for a mid-night snack. I wanted to biscuits and gravy for $2.95, great deal and good meal. But recently I've been having trouble with my card, so I went to the front desk to try and pay first, in order to make sure that the meal was paid for in full. But they wouldn't allow me to? What?! Who turns down money? \"um excuse me, may I give you MONEY for foo?\" ... \"no sorry, we don't do that hear\"  okay... So I'll just go eat as you insist and then, hope that the money goes through. Wait a moment, eureka! greatest place on earth. They don't want your money, only want to give you food. Sweet! So I ordered my water and my biscuits and yes the biscuits were so good, I literally licked the plate and for $2.95, steal.  But then just like I predicted, when I brought up the check to pay the bill, the card wouldn't go through. So they called over the manager Jessica. What a good smile. What good service. She took the time to listen to both sides of the issue and then after ruled that it was not worth fighting over and comped the breakfast and then sent me away with a smiley warning.   Ps-I went back for breakfast this morning, scrambled eggs with lox, sourdough toast and hash browns. The eggs were bland the hash browns were under cooked but the sourdough was sweet as can be. And for the record, when serving tea, the water shouldn't be scalding hot. I want to drink it, not take the paint off my car."}
{"text":"Nice little joint, nice little waiter, nice little waitress If only this were what we eat out for it would be a five star review.  But we do have to consider the food do we not?  Tomato soup with basil, good flavour but to course in texture.  Meat loaf with mashed potato and mushroom gravy, Sounded good, was not good. I suspect the gravy was not made with a roux for thickening, but corn startch. It had the look and taste of a liquid clear plastic. If the potatos were real they found a batch that did a good job of playing the part of a boxed flake. The meat loaf had no discerning quality at all, so who knows if it was meat or tofu.  The iced tea was in a nice slender glass, but the flavour was of a nice tinted water.   The cookie was very flavourful with a good amount of chips inside.   So to say I enjoyed the food would be an untruth. Yes I will go back to try something else, just nothing with a sauce or gravy on it.   I forgot I also got a side of beans. Again a very odd consistancy for the sauce in which they sat. Much too sugary with no other flavour."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. Good food- the cheese omelet hit the spot! The service was excellent! The coffee kept comin'- which was exactly what we needed."}
{"text":"Holy Crap, if you are wasted at South Point Casino and it's past midnight, head over to the Coronado Cafe.  I swear to God they sprinkle little bits of meth on all their food.    First, they have AWESOME late night chinese food.  The General Tso's chicked was out of this world.    Second, after midnight they have a special late night menu of breakfast items ranging from $1.50 (biscuits & gravy) to $3.45 (steak and eggs).  Where else are you going to get a 7 oz new york strip, two eggs, hashbrowns, and toast for $3.45???? Hell, we established that you could pretty much order the first four things on the late night menu and come in under $10....we are talking about FULL MEALS here people.    ***Disclaimer.  I was wasted far from sober by the time we went here.  However, it was the most delicious late night drinking food I have ever eaten.  Also, the service sucks.    The Star rating is based on how awesome this place is a 3 a.m. when you're hammered at South Point."}
{"text":"Lavosh and brie, crab soup, hummus, and the Maryland Crab Cakes Entreé. This was our second trip here - the first time was purely by chance during a trip to the Heard Museum, which is a short and beautiful walk through a historical district away. The first time It immediately became a favorite, and added to the list of go-to places for taking out of town guests to dinner. This was the promised \"bring Dad\" trip from the *previous* review, and they didn't disappoint. Dad arrived before us, and had a good conversation with the owner. He knew more about the place than we did by the time we got there. That's my Dad. When they say \"Best Crab Cakes in Phoenix,\" they mean it. We stuffed ourselves on them. These are not a few chunks of crab surrounded by a loaf of breading. These are big, chunky, fresh crab. For my wife, who is from a seaside village in Penang, Malaysia, the good seafood dishes are a joy you can see on her face while she's enjoying them. Not a cheap place to eat, but very worthwhile for those special occasions when you want to take someone special to someplace special - especially if they have an appreciation for the unique and \"non-chain/franchise\" experience."}
{"text":"Ate here twice.  Service was good.  Waiters would come by to check on us periodically.  Each time I would order their $12.99 porterhouse special.  Not bad at all.  Cooked the way I asked (med rare).  Wanted to try out their midnite specials, but was either too tired or not hungry enough to go.  If you do try, the line to get a table are looooooong..."}
{"text":"You should know by now that I'm a sucker for a deal....We dined for their 12 am thru 6 am specials. I had the 7oz NY steak with hash browns and eggs for $4.95!  I must say that the steak was perfectly grilled,  the eggs were perfectly cooked over hard, and the hash browns were a golden crisp like I like them. My husband's hamburger was juicy, the lettuce was crisp, the tomato was thickly sliced and the onion was freshly sliced (yes, I can tell!), the bun was lightly toasted and soft on the inside!  His burger was $3.95! Woop! Woop!"}
{"text":"I only come here for the $4.95 steak & eggs before 6am. The last time I had it, the steak looked weird. The color of the steak was off, but it tasted alright. It's under $5, so I guess you get what you pay for. I'm a sucker for a bargain."}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service from The Guy Cashier from Last night!!!  He was too stupid to pay attention on how much bills he receives from customers!!! Not even apologetic...."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. It was literally the spot for late night meals. It was great because they had those midnight specials. However, those under 21 are no longer allowed to order off of there. They can but it would be the regular price of what it is during the day. Even if they were with a person over 21, they'd still have to pay the full price of the meal. I don't know what the real truth behind this new rule is, or how it even started, but not everyone should have to suffer with this. Imagine how much money the cafe would be making by now if they allowed those under 21 to eat with a decent price? Over the summer, the cafe was a big hit and I'm sure they made a lot of money then. Now when you go, it's not as busy as it used to be. They may have peak points but it wasn't like the summer rushes.   The cafe was my favorite steak and eggs place. It was very fulfilling and no other steak and egg late night place can compare to this. Now, with this new rule, some of us have to result in Silverton's \"HEGGS\" place. And it is crap compared to Coronado Cafe, especially their hash browns. (I always looked forward to Coronado's hash browns.) There's not even a steak and egg option on Silverton's menu."}
{"text":"For the price it's what I would expect. 6.95 for two eggs hash bribes bacon and toast. Very mediocre but again I'm not complaining since you get what you pay for. $1 mimosa and bloodys before 12. Definitely can tell it's only worth a dollar."}
{"text":"It's a coffee shop in Vegas... We all know what to expect. The food met that expectation, but the service didn't even come close. What I got was a surly waiter who ignored me. Fail."}
{"text":"my friend from vegas took me for breakfast this morning we gonna try the buffet  from the casino but the line was huge so we Whent to this cafe prices are ok food is good I try grits and corned beef hash w/eggs enough  he order steak & eggs"}
{"text":"The portions are large, especially the Pad Thai and Singapore noodles. They serve them separately in a silver bowl and you eat from a plate. At the end, the bowl still looked full. Lots of leftovers.  Presentation of the Swiss steak was alright. The corn was too sweet for me so it ruined the rest of the dish.  The meals I had were lukewarm. Staff is very friendly and they make sure the drinks are always full"}
{"text":"The breakfast food was very good. The waitress and waiters are very attentive.  Their coming from everywhere to make sure your ok. I ordered a omelet which had bay shrimp, alvacado and white cheddar cheese. It also come with hash browns and your choice of bread for toast.    The presentation didn't look good at all but the food was great.  (I guess the old saying is, \"don't judge a book bu it's cover.\")   And another thing the hot cocoa was in a very small mug and not refillable."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch here yesterday, 03/17, before our trip over to PHX Art Museum. We shared the Nachos to start, very good. I had the chicken salad and she tried the Chicken with a side of baked beans. My chicken was spiced perfect and I loved mix. We wife not a big fan of leaving her comfort zone, enjoyed trying something new. I tried a bite and too enjoyed the sandwhich and beans. The atmosphere was excellent and the only draw back was the wait staff seemed a little discombobulated. All and all a great time and great meal."}
{"text":"Made my second trip here last night.  My sister suggested it as she loves their brie and lavash appetizer (a mixture of fruit, vinaigrette, and cheese).  My girlfriend and sister both got the Miso salmon as the main course while I got the crab cakes.  Both dishes are tasty and well-prepared with excellent presentation.  The atmosphere of this place is very much that of a neighborhood haunt.  Its located along the main drag on 7th Street, but its in a cute restored bungalow that very much feels like someones living room.  Even the bar area feels very homey.  My only reason for docking a point here are the prices.  For what we had, they're a little steep.  I've had crab cakes and salmon of equal quality for cheaper prices at other valley restaurants.  The crab cakes plus the side of fingerling potatoes and corn was about $25 and the salmon with rice was about $16.  You could certainly get a better deal for these dishes elsewhere.  But if you have the money to spend for the evening, the atmosphere and service and this comfortable spot will bring you back."}
{"text":"This a good place to grab breakfast lunch or dinner if you don't want to leave the hotel.  The food portions are very reasonable and the food is always very well prepared.  I would say this is a good place to grab food for small or large parties!  In addition, they are open later for late night hotel guests."}
{"text":"I understand how some people can give this place three stars, 4 would be over doing it. Food was edible, price is probably what gave the better rating  First of all I was not able to eat here and take advantage of their 12am- 6am dirt cheap food. I really wanted to too! the line was ridiculously long, it was literally down the hall and around the corner! I stood there for about 15 minutes and we never moved, so I decided that my time was costing me money as well.  The next day (Monday, 08/15/2011) we were heading out and decided to stop by for brunch, it was a shorter line this time but it still took about 10 minutes before we were seated.  Once we sat down we waited about 20 minutes before the waitress finally took our order, then it took 50 minutes before we got our food, I know many people like to eat breakfast at lunch time or dinner, but I think we should be allowed to make that choice not have it forced upon you. I ordered breakfast and didn't get it 'til lunch!  The pancakes had a hint of fish flavor to it, the fries were rubbery, the Chicken wrap was over salted. A friend of mine got a bagel, fruit cup & Coffee had to pay more than the person who got pancakes, eggs, bacon & Mimosa, how does that make any sense? I personally got the two eggs, hash brown, country fried steak with a side of corned beef hash with glass of water and only had to pay $2 more. Someone needs to redo their menu pricing!!!  We were not the only one who had a problem with the slow service because the table around us all had the same problem and people were getting up left and right looking for some explanation on why our waitress disappeared and that no food was coming out. After it finally came out, the waitress explained to us that the hostess sat us wrong and instead of distributing/spreading new customers  across the room, they sat us all down one after the other making it hard to get all our orders in and getting them out at the same time.   Although I understand her frustration, I've seen many wait staff handle a lot more than this and have done it well. Naturally we (all the tables affected) asked to speak with the manager abut the situation. The manager we spoke to (forgot to look at her name tag) was a skinny young Black woman, mid 20's, early 30's. She seemed way to young and soft spoken to be a manager which explains her stupidity. She just apologized to use and instead of blaming the operation failure, she blamed it on the waitress. Then attempted to walk away. One of us asked if our bill would be reduced because how the ridiculous wait time, it took her by surprise and she said she would.   When the adjusted check came (we were paying separately) this is what the manager took off of the bill, ONE COFFEE, ONE MIMOSA. are you freaken kidding me?????, if you know that we all had separate bills, we ALL had to wait over an hour, EACH one of us should have something written off!  My advise to you if you come here, ask for someone, anyone to check on your order every 5 minutes, you never know if you are gonna have this situation!"}
{"text":"A good restaurant deserving of at least 4 stars and the potential to earn 5.   Went there with my fiance for dinner.  We had the portobello sandwich ($11) and the green chili pasta with salmon ($19).   The sandwich was good, everything tasted fresh, but nothing \"special\" about it to warrant 5 stars.  It came with a side and we chose the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was actually phenomenal, not too heavy with cheese, but had a perfect amount of bread crumbs giving it a nice crunch.    The green chille pasta tasted great...for the first few bits...then good for the next few bites....then edible for the next few bites...and then at the end I just felt like a pig.  Not used to eating cream based pasta.  This would be great as an appetizer for the table to split, but too heavy for me to eat for a meal.  The piece of salmon that came on top was thick and definitely a generous portion.  However, it was a bit pink on the inside (we ate it anyway, too hungry to send it back).  Nevertheless, still tasty.  The menu said that the pasta dish came with tomato bruschetta, but the waitress did not bring any bruschetta.  So, I asked her for bread and she did bring a french baguette which was good, although the bruschetta probably would have gone better with the meal.  Will definitely be back to try some other items on their menu that are a little less heavy than the pasta."}
{"text":"Love coming here for their graveyard special. Lines can get long around midnight though but my boyfriend and I never had to wait that long mainly because we found out from a friend that we could just walk up to the bar and sit there if there's a free seat. We've only tried their steak and eggs and cheeseburger. Service has always been pretty good. Good service and good prices? What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Probably the best graveyard special in town starting at 11pm. 3.95 for steak and eggs, a nice sized steak not those lil strips. 2.95 for a quarterpounder burger and fries.  Fast service, brought food and drinks out fast, to go foods were fast also. Yet there by 11 pm cause if you wait even 10 mins lines form."}
{"text":"The late night specials on the table tops max out at $4 at the time of this review. The wait can be upwards of 20 minutes for entry near midnight. The specials are good from midnight to 6 am. The 7 ounce steak with hash browns, two eggs and bread is the best of these specials. The steak is prepared almost always correctly and the hash browns are getting better each visit."}
{"text":"Wow! I am very pleased with the service and the food. It definitely did not disappointment. The food was good quality and the servers are friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of a cafe in a casino especially when there is a buffet about 1000 ft away.  With a buffet you get one price and big variety and all you can eat.  Well, yesterday I forgot my casino card (that gives you a discount)  and the buffet brunch was $2 more at  $18.95. I wasn't THAT hungry.  I always saw a steady flow of customers at the Coronando Cafe so I decided to try it out.  I like the openness in terms of space and seating.  When it gets busy the staff do check on you but the pleasantries go out the door and they are direct. You need this or that? No? Moving on.  Which I don't mind if you are busy.  Now, for the food. I had the Southpoint Special. It's a layered mix of eggs, melted cheese, potatoes, red and green peppers, onions, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.  I ordered it with corned beef hash on the side and wheat toast.  I was expecting small portions but it was pretty big and I couldn't finish it all.  It was delicious!  I think it was the complementary cinnamon coffee cake that started to fill my stomach. Overall I'm satisfied with my experience and will not overlook this little gem again."}
{"text":"CAN YOU SAY DIRT CHEAP STEAK AND EGGS??!!   Yes that's right graveyard special for only 5.95 a nice juicy tender 7oz NY Strip Steak, 2 Eggs however you want them, Fairly cooked Has Browns with Toast and Jelly.   I went to vegas for a random adventure Saturday Night but since i was here I wanted to hit up South Point and get the $6 Deal. =D   I recommend anyone to this cafe after your inebriated or sober after celebrating the nightlife in wonderful viva las vegas. Peace Yelp Heads!"}
{"text":"On a whim popped in for early dinner.  Ordered the special of shrimp creole with side salad which also included rolls.  Gibbs had ordered the porterhouse steak with baked potato onion rings garlic toast....both were fast and delicious.  Have a feeling might be back for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"We were here for the 2017 Vegas shoot, we went here for breakfast and although there was a long line it moved fast and we were seated promptly.  Staff was attentive and friendly,  food was plentiful and tasty.  We'll go back for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Nascar Brendan Gaughan's sponsor  Left Las Vegas this morning and saw Brendan Gaughan driving the South Point Casino Chevrolet and decided to stop by and check out the property and had lunch at the Coronado Café. Our host and waiters were fast and considerate and very friendly and helpful, the restaurant was clean and well maintained. Service was quick and accurate.   My wife had the Veggie Wrap with herb tortilla, which see said was very tasty.  I had the Sunday special, the turkey dinner and would recommend it to everybody. The special had a large portion of white breast meat, mashed potatoes with gravy, dressing, cranberry sauce, veggies and bread with real butter for $8.95, what a good deal.  To summarize, The food and prices was great. They have very good deals for late night eaters. I'll definitely be back next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"We were staying at the south Point Hotel and this was a convenient place for breakfast. Lox & Bagels are not easy to find in Texas so I had that on my mind for breakfast. I tried it on Sunday and it was so good I had the same thing on Monday.  This place is not fancy but it is very clean and the people who work here are exceptionally nice. Our other guests were equally pleased with their breakfast choices.  Check it out, I think you will like it!"}
{"text":"Place is always packed, all the staff including management are foreign.   Chinese food is great and has been for years. We tried the breakfast and is very overpriced and we sent eggs back 2 times so we could get over medium.  English muffin is ala carte and at 2.95 we could of Boughten whole package. Breakfast prices very high.  Stick with the Chinese food menu only."}
{"text":"It was my last night in Vegas. It was 3:30AM and I had just wrapped up a session of NL Hold 'Em. What to do next ... sleep? Please. This was my third time in Vegas, and there was one Vegas tradition that I had not checked off my list yet - grabbing a late night special from a casino diner. So off I went to the Coronado Cafe!  Not surprisingly, the place was about half full at 3:30 AM. I opted for the \"Pancake Sandwich\" late night special - 2 pancakes with a slice of ham stuck in-between, and a fried egg on top. Egg was cooked perfectly, and I broke the yolk to make a runny mess on the plate, then added syrup. Pancakes were OK, a bit dense. Coffee was, well, late night diner coffee. Go to Seattle's Best near the casino entrance for a good cup during the day ... at the late night, this was acceptable.   Coronado Cafe is nothing mind-blowing ... it's just basic late night casino/diner food prepared fairly well. I'd recommend another option at South Point during the day (Del Mar Cafe, Steak N Shake), but Coronado Cafe is fine for the late night casino munchies."}
{"text":"Breakfast here 3/28/17 We had to wait in line 10mins or so, not bad.  Pretty busy.  Breakfast & lunch items in the $9-13 range.  Coffee was on the spendy side $3.25.  I ordered the South point Special, wife the corned beef and son the chicken fried steak.  The special showed up as three eggs on top of grated cheese, diced ham/potato/onions.  Wish I'd read the description better :) my fault, i was expecting just a normal eggs/ham with hash browns on side.  Eggs with cheese disagrees with me.  I ate about half trying to pick off the cheese.  Wifes corned beef arrives as two dry slices of rye with corned beef.  Thats it.  No dressing, cheese, mayo, etc. Nothing very good about it, especially for $13.99.  Son inhaled his chix fried steak.  Waiters were prompt, courteous, water glasses/coffee kept topped off.  Food came out in 10 minutes, pretty good for how busy it was.  No discount for players card here.  The midnight specials looked like a great bargain, I might come back for that, but I'll skip breakfast/lunch here."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this three stars instead of five is the fact the food came out Luke warm warm"}
{"text":"This place has good food. I come here at least 3 times a year and I am never disappointed. Cafe style food, nothing too fancy, but it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Ok, steaks and eggs at 2:30am for about $5$ How can this be bad? If you play and win, then the $5 Steaks and Eggs is a plus.  If you play and lost, the Steaks and Eggs dinner is a small victory.  I have eating here 5 times, late at night.  I have had the fortune of having my food well prepared, my host and waiters were fast and considerate, and I have no problems coming back!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to have to write a review like this for a local restaurant.  I am vegan.  I had a lunch reservation for Coronado Cafe, but decided to call ahead of time to work out any kinks in the preparation (e.g., no butter, no refined sugar, no smuggled in eggs or milk or cheese).  When I called, I thought I was lucky to have reached the owner.  I was quickly disabused.  She quipped that I should have taken the time to look up their menu online.  (By the way, of course I had, but they don't label!)  When I told her that the menu doesn't tell me everything I need to know for my diet (e.g., the butter or sugar issue), she got really exasperated and whined, \"I'm trying to help you.\"  I said that was great and I'd like the help.  She then said that they have several vegetarian items, which again I explained might not be vegan (a vegan diet is more restrictive, so just because it's vegetarian does not necessarily mean it's vegan).  I asked her, for example, to ask the chef if the veggie burger was vegan, and she said,  \"I'm the owner and I know everything about the menu.\"  So I asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said, \"I don't know.  Is a veggie burger vegan?\"  I said, \"Some are; some aren't.\"  She said, \"I don't think this is a place for you.  Don't come.\"  I didn't.  And I won't ever.    To sum up:  The owner is rude, unhelpful, unknowledgeable about food -- and to top it all off, she refuses to talk to the chef (who could easily answer food prep questions).  Two thumbs down; two thumbs way down."}
{"text":"Just ok. The bus staff was great but the wait staff was just ok. One wasn't very happy about a customer and they choose to discuss this in front of the rest of us. I had A salad. It looked nice but way too much dressing and the server never came back to see if everything was ok. My son had chicken and waffles. Waffles were fine but the chicken was rubbery.  Might try next time but unlikely."}
{"text":"This review is purely for their $5 steak and eggs!! Midnite-6am! ($4.95 to be exact).  Literally my boyfriend's favorite place in Vegas.  Last trip, we stayed in Vegas for 3 nights and ate here twice.  Also, since we always make him drive, he gets to nap in the car while my friend and I hit up $5 blackjack tables, heh.  This place is about 15 minutes south of the strip, so we'll either try to stop by on the way in from socal, or cross our fingers and hope someone is sober enough to drive us at the end of a clubbing night loll.  I always get my steak medium-rare and I've had no complaints with theirs!  It definitely beyond exceeded my expectations for only $5.  Also you get 2 eggs however you want them, hash browns, and toast!  I have yet to find as good of a deal as this one (and in vegas of all places!? incredible).  Go, gamble, drink, feast.  Maybe play a blackjack hand and pay off your dinner with it."}
{"text":"This can be summarized with a few words: SOUTH POINT $5 STEAK AND EGGS!!!! (After midnight) You just can't beat the late night menu at this place. Beware if you're a coffee drinker; the brew is always watered down every time I go."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for lunch- it is great! Last week, I was part of a four top and we all got very different items: crab cakes, pork tacos, braised beef and the meatloaf. They were all terrific. The atmosphere is great - it is a little historic bungalow with white clothes and little flower arrangements on the tables. The service is terrific. Try to make reservations as the place is small, but they aren't required."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was not. Even my kids wouldn't eat their Mac and cheese. It was totally tasteless. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place now for 4 years and of course, it's for the midnight $3.95 steak and egg dinner. The NY Steak use to be 8oz. but they are now 7oz. but I still do not complain. I personally like my hash browns \"animal style\" like the fries at In-N-Out Burger so I order the hash browns with grilled onions and a side of thousand island dressing!  Service may sometimes take longer but only because it can occasionally get packed in there from all the other people ordering off their midnight menu. I also live right across the street though so it is very convenient for me. if I get the late night munchies after a night out."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because of our server, Didier. He was attentive, prompt, and very funny. Wonderful service!  The food is mediocre. I like the salt and pepper sea bass. I saw that they also have late-night deals like $2.95 steak and eggs after midnight. Great place to go to if you're experiencing some late-night munchies!"}
{"text":"This place was so good i had to come back twice! The Chinese menu closes at 11pm but the cafe is open 24 hours. Great late night specials. The steak is made exactly to order so i hope you know how you like your steak lol. No complaints here. None what-so-ever."}
{"text":"Decent, inexpensive food. Reasonably quick service and not a long wait. Kind of what you'd expect from a Dennys kind of place."}
{"text":"Id leave 5 stars, but we waited almost half an hour to be seated...because they were short staffed.  Food is really REALLY good! late night steak and eggs are the best bargain around.  Even the chinese food is good  Perfect late night munchies spot."}
{"text":"LATE NIGHT STEAK AND EGGS! yes! when you're out late with friends or family and a few drinks or just got done watching a movie.. and wanting breakfast for dinner. this is a place to go! i normally order my steak medium and scrambled eggs with a side of wheat toast and grape jelly! it is worth the late night food run for under $10!!! the coronado cafe, isn't just good for their steak and eggs but I have tried their Chinese menu for lunch with some friends courtesy of Southpoint comps! We ordered, bbq ribs, fried rice, combination pan fried noodles. both the fried rice and pan fried noodles was to my chinese food expectation. but as for the bbq ribs, it was too dryyy and the bbq wasn't flavorful at all."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch at the Coronado Cafe with my husband.  I ordered the  $14.95 prime rib special. ..delicious! It came with choice  of soup or salad, I chose a salad. ..nicely dressed with croutons, chewy tomatoes, olives, and cucumbers. The prime rib came with creamy horse radish and aus jus, a  baked potato with all the fixings which is what I had or French fries. I had fresh hot  coffee which was refilled  quickly.  My husband liked his 16oz Porterhouse steak topped with 2 huge crunchy Onion rings ( which um I snagged  one of them )he ordered his steak med/well. It came with soup or salad,  and he chose to have french fries with it.  It also came with garlic toast...yum! His Porterhouse special was  $14.95!!! We were too full to order desert. ..maybe next time."}
{"text":"Lucky for me this place is right around the corner from the office. I can taste the tuna salad salad as I'm typing this... the poppy seed dressing is SO good. They also have great sandwiches and what not. I've never been for dinner or their brunch though. It's on the smallish side as it's located inside what used to be a home. That would be my only complaint. It's hard to get a small group of friends in there. I've always had good service and even though it tends to be a popular spot I've never had to wait more than 10 min which is great when you have a limited lunch hour."}
{"text":"I live in Vegas and have been here several times in the past 5 or so years. I feel like you have to be lucky or come I at the right time in order to get everything to come out right here. Which obviously isnt great because it should have customer priority and quality 24/7. Many others say they love getting their steak and eggs here. Although, Servers aren't good at checking up on you. The one time I've had steak n eggs here, my food was incredibly cold. One day I might consider giving them another try because I like Southpoint & everything else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Slow service. SLOW service. Let me tell you, the service, was slow.   The midnight deals are great, but my grandfather wanted to eat every meal here. The selection was not that great, and for people with nut allergies it's even worse.   They don't clean the woks well, if at all, said my waitress. This means that I could not order any Chinese food which seemed to be far and away the best items on the menu. My chicken and waffles came with kids chicken strips that were fried a little too long.   I think if you're a breakfast person, you're safe here, or if you want the Chinese food it all looked great, but my time was pretty poor here."}
{"text":"I might be biased for eating good Chinese food for many years, but this place was disgusting in making Chinese food. I'm not much of a fan of restaurants that cook up different ethnic styles of food in one place. The only decent item we had was the seafood soup which came with crab pieces and mushrooms. The others like bbq pork spareribs, BBQ duck and a seafood plate of hot and spicy shrimp and scallops were all not appetizing. They tasted bland and definitely needed more seasoning. The shrimp and scallops dish was deep fried, but tasted mushy with the added sauce.  They do offer a range of different options from American fare to Chinese plus some other choices. The prices don't seem too expensive as we didn't have to pay for our meal since it was comped by the hotel. I saw that they have late evening meal specials like steak and eggs, but never for Chinese food again except in a Chinese restaurant.  The service was good, but we did have to wait a bit for our dinner to be served. They even gave us a free serving of Cheesecake to help celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"steak and eggs under $5 hell yah. great spot to stop by when visiting friends in Vegas less then $20 feed 4 people. Not as pack as other spots and more locals here then anything else. Stop in worth it."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. If you're hanging out this far off the strip, you're looking for a deal. The folks at South Point will take care of you and for a very reasonable price. If you go between midnight and 6am, you can get steak and eggs for $4.99. Don't expect dry aged beef, but for that price you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"3.95 steak n eggs! That should of got your attention! No player card needed. Available from midnight to 6 am. They also have other good choices off their graveyard menu.   I love this place because unlike some other places, you don't get to breathe in cancer causing smoke while you are eating. The ventilation is really good here. Service is above average.   The only thing you gotta worry about is sometimes there is a long line just right before midnight just so everybody can get those graveyard specials. So if you are already starving, you will probably get all cranky waiting to sit down and order. You might wanna pack a snickers cuz just like the commercial, you're not you when you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst breakfast I've ever had in my life. Don't ever review on Yelp but had to say something about this. I thought screwing up breakfast was impossible. Toast was completely soggy, hash browns tasted like raw potatos and the eggs were the sorriest looking, discolored, wannabe eggs I could have ever had in my life. Only ate anything because I was completely starving after an event. Only meal I've ever considered walking out on. Don't know how anyone can eat here."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good if you like something quick and easy at the casino. I know the people who work there are always working at their best and they do their best to cater to their customers. How do I know? Cause I usually go there late in the middle of midnight or 1am-3am and the customer service is still good. :) I guess the only thing that would need work on is sometimes the food... The food has came out a couple times where 1) the bread wasn't cut in the center (lol I might be picky, but it was cut like 1/4 and 3/4, not a biggie but yeah it was actually kinda funny) and the burger came out like the meat was burnt this one time... Overall, nice service and nice people. It's never bad to come here to grab a bite before catching a movie or anything. :)"}
{"text":"Service is so bad in this place. Yes cheap food but really??? Food Not even that great. There's other places with $6 steak and eggs. Geez!!! We went all the way here for their crap and had to walk out for bad service. This casino just lost 9 people to lose money on their tables. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME FOR CHEAP FOOD and you'll just regret coming anyways."}
{"text":"We haven't been to the Coronado Cafe in some time and I used to frequent it during late work hours. The food was always adequate and the service good and friendly. Last night, we decided to go late bowling and have a 2am breakfast there. The cafe was full of patrons with a line to get seated but we managed to be seated within 10-15 mins, so that wasn't too bad. Once we were seated it was bad news. 15 more minutes to be noticed in the corner where they sat us. We made our food order, Chicken Salad and Lox and Cream Cheese Bagel. Nothing needing to be cooked and 2 glasses of water. It took 45mins to be served! The waitress forgot the bagel and at first was going to argue that it didn't come with one until she read the ticket, abruptly stopped her sentence and walked away bringing a bagel 5mins later. My wife's Chicken Salad was dry and tasted like the chicken had been sitting a while. Then they never refilled our water glasses. I asked the waitress on 2 occasions for a water refill and it never came. Then as we left and I told her we never got our water, she just smiled and said \"Have a nice day.\" I know things can get pretty busy for waitresses and their staff but they do have busers to help them and we only saw ours once. Needless to say, we won't be going back to that restaurant for while if ever again. Too many other places to go and be taken care of in Vegas to go back to that mess."}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe is located in South Point Casino waaaaay on the South side of Las Vegas Blvd.  We arrived around 4 a.m. and the place was PACKED (I heard members of our party that arrived before us were in line for about 20-30 minutes). I think it was worth it though.  I just may add this to my list of my after-clubbing dining options.  They had a kind of \"cab-drivers-specials\" menu available midnight to 6-ish I think.  Nothing was over $4.  The majority of our 12-person party ordered the $3.95 steak and eggs.  http://www.southpointcasino.com/press/cafe-graveyard-special.php  They also had a full menu as well as Chinese food.  Drink orders were taken promptly after we were seated as were our food orders.  We waited a reasonable amount of time considering the size of our party and how busy the Cafe actually was.  Our servers brought some crunchy chow mein noodle things with 4 different dipping sauces for us to munch on while we waited...   Bottom Line: Cheap eats after midnight.  Courteous and accomodating staff.  Just make sure you have a DD or cab fare because South Point is a bit of a drive from the Strip."}
{"text":"In the hot AZ summer going to Coronado island is a great idea, however if you can't make the commute the Coronado Cafe is a great 2nd choice.  This place has everything you need for a great date.  Quaint and romantic old house setting and patios. Table cloths and faux candles Menu full of artfully presented items Wines by the glass or bottle Background music in lieu of background noise.  We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?  For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.  The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.  Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12  The meal included bread with olive oil.  Bottom line great romantic place for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting now. We wanted breakfast and this was the only place that came to mind at 1 am. We ordered the graveyard special, steak and eggs for $4.95 and sausage and eggs for $3.95. It used to be good a long time ago, maybe because that was during my drinking days. Now that I'm going to be a mommy, I wouldn't feed this food to a dog. The sausage and scrambled eggs weren't cooked. Uncooked eggs and uncooked pork? Are you trying to get people sick?!?!?! The hash browns were mush and my BF's steak was tough and rubbery. Our server was miserable in life and was not about to get a tip for doing a $hitty job. Why did we ever think this place was good?"}
{"text":"If you are local.. you know about $3.95 Steak and Eggs at SouthPoint. That's right.. $3.95 for everyone's favorite slab of meat paired with the incredible edible egg. I was more of a fan of the biscuits and gravy (1.95) or the cheeseburger (3.95)  Unfortunately, I will NOT be frequenting here anymore. The catastrophic demise came a few weeks ago. If you are a creature of the night and venture here please be forewarned that somewhere between 3am-4am they are doing credit reports and their system will not allow payments with anything but cash. So.. at 4am you are left to stand around a counter in a drunken sleepy state while the system is \"reporting\"  This happened for the second time a few weeks ago and we were standing there for about 10 minutes when I asked to speak to a manager - Finally someone came up-- obviously not the Manager, expressed no sympathy. I told him this was the second time this happened and its frustrating when its 4am and you have to wait 15 minutes to pay your bill. He seemed frustrated with  me and gave me a disgusting grimace and walked away. pshhhhhh ....   Sucks.. Now I gotta find a better spot for late night grub.. Maybe Terribles?"}
{"text":"Bad service ... Came towards the end of the breakfast rush so we expected a bit of a wait for things but it was worse than we figured. Coffee and waters took 10+ min; our waitress finally showed up (her lack of English hindered what we were trying to order, she kept repeating things back severely wrong).  With that being said, she messed up 2 of the 7 meals + one bakery Danish was old and hard as a rock. We hardly saw our waitress, had to waive down other servers for napkins/utensils + refills."}
{"text":"My friends has been bothering me about this whole \"Steak and eggs\" thing since we visited Las Vegas for EDC. However, we were unable to get the food because we wouldn't make it in time. To be honest, I thought this steak was BS! $4.95? Pfft, can't be true. Thursday November 24th at 1:30am. My opinion has changed on this!!! I ended up ordering two orders for myself. The steak (Medium Rare) was really good! The only problem I had was how long it took for our \"To-Go\" order to come. I understood the kitchen was heavily backed up. At least don't let us wait for an estimate of 17-23 minutes! Everyone was friendly and nice! I would most definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star because of their horrible service! They need to change their servers because they are so rude ESPECIALLY! To young ones!!! Steak was not even that good, I mean I paid for what I get but I wanted the medium but it was well done instead! I hate this place. Never going back. Biscuit is good though."}
{"text":"If I could give this five zero stars, I would. First, the lines are ridiculously long with multiple open tables. Service is painfully slow. Especially our server, Todd. Who was rude and could not understand anyone's order--he only spoke English, so language was not his problem--it must just be stupidity. My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and was concerned he got that wrong--she tried to confirm with him he'd received her correct order. He said, in a dismissive tone, \"yeah, yeah, I got it.\"  He didn't. He brought the totally incorrect order. When it arrived he tried to argue with her as to what she'd ordered. Once her corrected order finally arrived the rest of the dining party was completely finished with their meals. He then seemed pleased with himself when his incorrect order was removed from the ticket--while still fully charging for the VERY late order. It took 30 minutes and four different \"supervisors\" to get the bill to reflect the poor service for breakfast. I would NEVER recommend this restaurant. If staying at the SouthPoint, get in your car and drive elsewhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a line after midnight for the graveyard specials but it moved very quickly. I totally expected to receive a well done steak and rubbery eggs for $4.95. To my surprise and pleasure, the steak and eggs were made to order and cooked to my specifications. The boyfriend had the veggie frittata and was happy as well. If you're up and looking for a tasty inexpensive late night fix, this is the place. Service was pretty good too considering they really have to turn tables very quickly to accommodate the wait. Waitress didn't really have time for small talk but she kept our drinks full and made sure we had all the condiments we needed so I was fine with that. You should go!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch with a group of 13 people on Sunday, Jan 4th...we are locals and had some people in from out of town. It was the weekend of my wonderful father's funeral. Even though it was such a sad weekend, the Coronado Café made our lunch so nice. They accommodated our large party so quickly, the service was so attentive and thorough. The gentleman in charge of our soft drinks and waters was Johnny on the spot. And with every refill came a smile. Our server, Regina was spectacular! She knew the reason for our getting together and she gave extra attention to my Mom. We also had a few allergies at our table and she took them SO SERIOUSLY! That means SO MUCH to me. The manager on duty (Wish I cold remember her name, long brown hair) came over and reiterated their protocol for handling allergies. It let me rest assured that my food would be safe for me and let me concentrate on spending time with my family. It may sound like it should be normal to have an allergy (mine is shellfish) accommodated but trust, me it's not! They even took the time to take a few group pictures of my family. And...oh yeah...the food...it was wonderful. Their hash browns are some of the best in  town! And my Mom tells everyone she knows how amazing the turkey club is! Should not be a novelty but it is REAL turkey, what a concept! haha and as she exclaims, \"they cook the bacon too!\" (Not soggy undercooked chewy straps of leather). So, all in all, we love the Coronado Café...from roominess of the dining area, to the service and the food. You can accommodate every taste and every occasion. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the south point.. Too less options for vegetarians.. overall the food is good. Coffee is just great."}
{"text":"We went at about 2am and took advantage of their Graveyard Specials. It was only $3.59 for the New York Steak and Eggs; that is what I recommend. It comes with a good size steak, two eggs prepared your way, and hash browns.  The service was great, constantly checking your table to ensure you have a great experience. Overall it was a wonderful meal  and the atmosphere was great. I really recommend it."}
{"text":"Go for the midnight specials! They have really decent late nite diner cafe food. I got the steak & eggs for $3.95 pretax. My sister got a good cut. Mine had lots of gristle. It comes with 2 eggs, hash browns, and two slices buttered toast (wheat, sourdough or white).  The midnite special for burgers are a deal too.   Don't get the chinese food. It looked awful."}
{"text":"Phoenix's foodie scene is in full bloom, and the Coronado Cafe is the best in the bundle.  Coronado prides itself on excellent ingredients, delicious recipes, and fantastic service and it delivers on all counts. This is one of my favorite places in central Phoenix.  Coronado has a stunning dinner menu, a lighter but still delicious lunch offering, and hosts a Saturday and Sunday brunch that is probably my personal favorite. Everything Coronado serves up, from its pepper-crusted sirloin with carmelized jalapenos and onions to their cafe meatloaf with sauteed pepper, squash, mushroom, and a balsamic reduction, to their home-made sticky buns on Saturday mornings is to die for.   My only words of caution would be that first, it's a rather small and intimate space - groups of four at the most are recommended."}
{"text":"I always come here with my uncle & aunt who live nearby. This is one of the places they often go to. They've made many friends with the people who work here, and many of the waitors would walk over to our table & talk to us. We would always come here for the late night specials :) It's nothing like what we get at 1AM back home in San Francisco. Haha"}
{"text":"The late-night grave special at the Coronado Cafe isn't a five star dining experience when it comes to quality..  This review isn't granting a five star rating based off that.  A person can always find a better ham steak, cheeseburger, poached egg, and side of hash browns.  This is a five star place because The Coronado Cafe treats it's late-night menu as a throwback to old school Vegas.  for $1.45 you get the biscuits and gravy.  For $3.95 you get the steak and eggs, hash browns, jelly w/toast.  This is the Vegas I grew up in and around as a kid. It's the specials like this that made this city great and must be reclaimed.  Thank You Coronado Cafe!"}
{"text":"Perfect little 24 hour spot for a quick bite. We work graveyards, so there's not many options to eat after work. We rarely like ending up at local dive bars eating fried food.   The service was good, nothing mind blowing, but it's what you'd expect at South Point. We'll definitely go back.   The bagel & lox breakfast platter was yummy. We originally went to try their Chinese menu but there wasn't anything close on the menu, assuming it's discontinued."}
{"text":"we were trying to order the special which is a 7oz steak with 2 eggs hash browns for 5 bucks. As we were about to order, we were told that our kids had to be at least 21 years of age to order the special which I thought was weird since they dont serve it with any alcohol, so as we tried to explain to them that the times we came here, the kids were allowed to order it, but now they're all of a sudden being struct with letting the kids order the special. This will probably be the last time I come here for food."}
{"text":"$3.95 steak and eggs upped to $4.95 from 12am - 6am, but still super cheap!  I almost ALWAYS come here when I'm at Vegas. It's about 15 minutes south of the strip, so it's on the way from SoCal if you're driving in/out late at night. Everyone in my group always orders the steak and eggs. You get: steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and bread (white, wheat, sourdough). A definite steal for $5.  Tip: I like to ask for Heinz 57 sauce, which tastes better than A1 steak sauce in my opinion. They keep it in the back, so you have to ask your waiter for it.  Also, South Point has $5 black jack tables, so sometimes we'll gamble while we wait!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to update my review after a friend and I ate here last night.  The service was outstanding! Everyone we encountered from the host, to the server, and even the gentlemen that refilled our drinks was friendly and attentive. My water never reached the bottom of the glass!  We each had the 12.99 Porterhouse Special and, for the price, it was fantastic! It was cooked well and was a generous portion! The plate came with a salad, the steak, 2 large onion rings, and your choice of either a baked potato or mashed potatoes, with a slice of garlic bread. The garlic bread was nothing special, but the rest of the meal was quite tasty!  Even though they were pretty busy, the server still checked on us and our drinks were refilled without even having to say a word. It was fantastic!  It had been 6 months since my previous experience here(which was quite underwhelming), but after last night I will certainly not wait that long to return again!  Bump it up to..  4 stars."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the graveyard specials. For the price, the food was pretty good. I tried the burger which was huge and cooked just right. The hub ordered breakfast and he was pleased. It's tough to get eggs just the way he likes it, and they cooked them perfectly.   If you get there right at midnight, there will be a long line. People really line up for the cheap menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was told the Blue Burger was incredible and they were right, even though everything on the menu looked good. Loved the atomsphere, in a tiny renovated house, each room decorated differently will artwork lined walls. Service excellent."}
{"text":"So our office tried something different for lunch than our more frequented 'renovated home\" type restaurants that we usually go to in downtown Phoenix. Because this is close to a place we usually go \"That's a Wrap\" we decided we'd try this place out for take out too.  The parking lot is a bit odd because its large/loose gravel....but there seemed to be plenty of spaces so that def. a bonus!  The atmosphere was really laid back and really pleasant. Very friendly staff seemed to be everywhere, so that was nice too.  My order was a take out order for about 10 people in my office. I thought for sure I'd be taking out 4 bags...but they had very economical/green packaging (paper boxes and paper wrappings) . So it was nice to only see 3 bags (once I got the food...which unfortunately took 40 mins. instead of 20 to prepare). But hey, it was busy and I had almost 10 orders...so no biggy. As far as the food, they didn't have baked beans as they state on their menus, nor did they have steak for their steak tacos. (weird...it wasn't even 12p yet and they were out of food?!) Back at the office, everyone enjoyed the food. It wasn't anything over the top nor was it 'plain'. So compliments to Coronado Cafe for that (usually some places are too froo froo for me downtown).  I had gotten the portobello sandwich w/ potato salad. The sandwich was very yummy. It  had onions, cheese and other ingredients and was on focaccia bread which added just the right amt. of flavor to the sandwich.   Although the food is good, I do wish the food wasn't as expensive as it was. (For I know the 1/2 sand. and 1/2 salad combo, that others ordered from the office,  really wasn't that big of a portion). All in all...nice little place with good food. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to stop in here for a quick dinner over the weekend. Can a dinner be quick and romantic? Yes it can.  We were early, so the place was pretty empty. Having the room to yourself? Romantic +1   The Coronado is in a great old Craftsman style building, with separate rooms full of beautiful wooden fixtures and great old built-ins. Even the bright, pedestrian art contributed to the cozy, yet polished vibe.  We started off with drinks from the cocktail menu. My date had some sort of gin and lemonade that was delicious. My \"Enter the Dragon\"? A bit too cough syrupy, but that was completely my fault for ordering something with \"raspberry vodka\" and expecting any different. Both were strong.  The crusty, chewy bread came with a quality olive oil and fruity balsamic for dipping. We inhaled the first plate, and got seconds when dinner arrived.  I ordered the Filipino-style beef salad, which was FULL of melt-in-your-mouth thinly sliced ribeye, and my date got the goat cheese relleno with creamy polenta.  That chef has got it goin on! The grilled veggies in the relleno were not mushy, and the polenta wasn't grainy. My ribeye had crispy edges but rare centers and there was a perfect balance of dressing to greens.   Our server was attentive and efficient without being all up in our business and the prices seemed reasonable for the quality.  Thank you, Coronado. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!  $4.95 for a steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast I was full but split an order of biscuits and gravy and had a spicy Bloody Mary.  All the food was good. Not the best steak but still was good and cooked to medium rare.  Eggs and hash browns really good and so was the Bloody Mary. What made it was the price"}
{"text":"Literally here every night, cheapest steak & eggs I've ever had  food is pretty good too! If you're someone who likes your steak medium well.. MAKE SURE YOU ORDER IT MEDIUM!! I noticed they over-cook their meats  Overrall, I rated a 5 for the price"}
{"text":"Don't come during late night hours. The place is full of rude, drunk, and low life people. The steak special looks like a beef jerky. The service is super slow. Avoid this place at all cost. The late night special is for age 21 and up only. How ridiculous is that?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here starving. Prices a kitty Me higher than expected for a $ place.  They did have great daily and late night specials. I am a bariatric patient (cant eat any type of potatoes or breads)and asked if I could swap out the mash potatoes for a few veggies or side salad. I was immediately informed no substitutes of any kind. I settled on a bowl of chili...it was bland and would have been better off ordering it at Wendy's for a buck. My husband orders off the Chinese menu and said it was ok but nothing great. We will not be back unless it's to try late night special"}
{"text":"5 Stars for the best Late Night \"Steak and Eggs\"!  don't even know how many times I've come here the last few years, maybe 100 times?? But their Late Night specials from Midnight-6am are the only reasons I've come here. I do hear great things about their Chinese Food though so I'll have to come back for one of these days. Their Graveyard Specials beat out The Orleans in my opinions since it's a lot fresher and feel like they give you a bit more. Also service is pretty fast. My boyfriend always get the Steak & Eggs $4.95 now (long time ago during recession was around $2.95) and I always get the Sausage & Eggs $3.45 (used to be around $2.95 also). They also offer Biscuits and gravy for $2.95, Pancake Sandwich $3.95, Ham Steak $3.95, and even 1/2 lb Cheeseburger with fries for $3.95! Yummo!  I just don't come here as much since my boyfriend and I cut back big time on meat but we still love coming here once in a while for late night eats after going out :)"}
{"text":"this review is strictly for their midnight steak and eggs.. technically called \"graveyard specials\"  SO GOOOOOOD I think it's safe to say I go here at least once a month.. and keep in mind I live in LA. they have good food at a super cheap price.. my favorite are the biscuits and gravy and the eggs, hashbrown, sausage combo.. i always order those 2.. sometimes i'll get the cheeseburger..  i'm not saying that this is top notch gourmet food and you cant get it anywhere else.. it's just a place to get delicious breakfast food at 2 in the morning and pay a realllly good price for it.. after going here i don't even think about going to denny's or all the other quick breakfasty places..   the reason why this place gets 5 stars.. it's just an amazing setup.. 12-6am ... super cheap prices.. quick.. somewhere i always want to go.. the ultimate \"go to place\""}
{"text":"Beautiful Historic Home from the inside and out!  Their Tuna Salad Is by far the best Tuna I've ever had.  Elegant with their white tablecloths and impressive decor, yet jeans are very appropriate.  Cant wait to go back when its raining to sit by a window!"}
{"text":"From my last review I said DEF not coming back. But apparently decided to go back the food is better but the service still need some work. Although one of our waiters was really nice. Then after he has to leave for his break, our service got pretty crappy. We had to wait and service by putting your hand up in order for a new waiter to help us. I know that they are busy, but just for a few things we asked it took a long while longer. If anything going there once in a while."}
{"text":"Agree with all the great reviews, had to throw in my 4 stars and word of warning -  I came here for lunch and ordered the half sandwich/cup o soup combo.  The chicken soup was bland and had a lot of corn in it which I've never seen before.  The roasted veggie sandwich was a lot of bread and not a lot of roasted veggies (should have read Sarah's review. . .doh!)  But everything else that everyone in the place was having looked amazing - burger, chicken caesar sandwich, chicken soft tacos, salads. . .my lunch mates were more than happy with their orders.  I happened to pick the two underwhelming items.  Poop."}
{"text":"I heart neighborhood cafes. Thus, before i went I liked it. We tried to go a couple of times and couldn't get in without a crazy wait. Finally, around Vday I made a reservation and we went (although when we went they didn't have our reservation written down...but they made it work).   Our waitor was really nice and just the right level of attentiveness. The food was really good (but not anything unique or out of this world). But quality nonetheless. The menu was a little limited. But typical bougie-cafe selections with a couple twists. Wine was good.   A little pricey. But I also kind of feel like if I can walk to the place, it's locally owned, and it's a reused space (i.e. an old home)...I can spend a little more."}
{"text":"Came here around 1 AM on a Friday night/Sat morning and it was packed! I was surprised to see a long line wrapping around the corner, but it moved fast. We were able to be seated in about 5-10 minutes.   I saw a table tent with a bunch of breakfast specials & some daily specials in the main menu. But, the 3 of us had our minds set on steak & eggs ($4.95). Its a 7 oz. steak with 2 eggs, hash browns and 4 (halves) pieces of toast. Ask for the hash browns to be extra crispy! They do butter their toast here so if you dont want butter, ask for no butter. I wish their toast was a little crispier but the food came out quickly and for only $5, I can't complain! The hash browns were a bit too soft for my liking, my steak was kind of dry looking but it was cooked medium, which was how I requested it to be. My friends' steaks were cooked medium rare (like they requested). I was very surprised that the cooks here did it right the first time. At other casino cafes, I've had to have them recook my steak for being too well done or too rare.   Service was pretty good. We were seated, presented with menus, and then someone came by to ask us what we wanted. I saw him refilling and bringing out drinks the entire time we were eating. Our order was taken shortly after.  Came here another time because primarily prime rib was closed for the day. Tried the prime rib here and itS decent! Not bad but I prefer the prime rib at Ellis island."}
{"text":"$4.95 steak and eggs. Need I say more? Definitely my favorite late night go-to for steak and eggs in Las Vegas.   Obviously this isn't Ruth Chris but for less than $5 you get a pretty good and hearty meal.   Best after club/drunk eat to end a raging night and sober up. Lol."}
{"text":"After a round of $1 midnight bowling, I was definitely getting the munchies.  So after being enticed by the sign for $4 steak and eggs, we dropped in.  Usually there's a small line when it starts to get past midnight, but it's never very long.  When you sit down, they give you a menu with lots of options, but the one you want is the one in the little standee on the table.  In addition to $4 steak and eggs, they also have $1-$3 breakfasts, which is as good a deal as you could ask for.  The servers are actually quite friendly for graveyard shifters, and are entirely accommodating.  Incidentally, they have a good selection of Asian food on the menu, though the prices on those are a bit more normal (think $5 to $8).  I've had the pad thai, not bad for a casino cafe!  Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Cafe burger and mahi mahi fish tacos were fabulous!   House salad dressing was very good. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the graveyard menu, but what a great thing it is. You can get every item on that menu for less than $25 and it would be enough food for about 6 people. I personally love the steak and eggs for $3.95. Are you kidding me, $3.95!? Guess what, it's actually good too. I have had a good quality steak every time I've gotten it. In the interest of full disclosure, I have only every been here once that I was not pretty well intoxicated. To my surprise, I enjoyed the food just as much that time as all of the other visits. My favorites on the menu are the steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy ($1.95 for 2 full biscuits smothered in gravy), two egg breakfast, and the cheeseburger isn't bad either.  I understand it's kind of out of the way most of the time, but for a cheap late night drunken breakfast it's the best place to drop my Hamilton. The graveyard specials are served from 12am to 6am seven days a week."}
{"text":"Located in South Point Hotel and Casino, Coronado Cafe is a decent place to grab a decent meal.    I do feel iffy about this place, even though it does look nice.  The service just seems to be less than satisfying.  We did come here for breakfast, but it seems like none of the staff feels like dealing with customers.  It does kind of sucks that I have to repeat my order 3-4 times till she finally got it.  I didn't want to sound like I was yelling, but it almost got to the point of raising my voice for her to hear my order.  At least they were good on refills.    After getting our food, I had the steak and eggs.  The eggs and hash brown was okay.  The steak on the other hand, was a tad bit chewy for a medium.  It was edible, but a bit unsatisfying.  Kind of felt like I was biting into a tire.    Overall, it may be a nice place, and it might be good for breakfast, but probably don't consider the steak for breakfast."}
{"text":"I hear the Chinese food is amazing but I was feeling \"blue plate special\" this visit.  The line was so long but being single I walked right in and had a seat at the counter.  Went for the daily $12.95 special Porterhouse.  Its not going to win any blue ribbons for best steak in town but I was impressed.  Cooked very nice and came with salad and baked potato.  the early bird special at Billy Bob's Sams Town is way better but its not apples to apples either.  Can't go wron for that price and being a South Point regular, I haven't had a bad meal yet at this casino."}
{"text":"Located on the east side of 7th St. just south of Thomas.  Another homey little cottage with hardwood floors.  Consistently good food at moderate prices keeps this place busy the only days of the week they're open for dinner, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  They have a strict reservations policy now, due to increased popularity in a small space.  They feature things like Lasagna, Pork chops, Stew - comfort food with a kick, and they do it well.  Close to downtown, makes it a great spot to be before an evenings event.  If you notify your wait staff right off, they do a good job of getting you on your way on time."}
{"text":"Lovely little space--the cafe is an old repurposed Phoenix home with plenty of patio space.  Very quaint.  The service was super friendly, and the seating areas were comfortable with enough privacy to have conversation.   I enjoyed their weekend brunch with Mimosa's. Food was solid breakfast fare with medium sized portions.  Most of the dishes had a slight Mexican flare (chorizo with the eggs Benedict, corn tortillas on the side, etc). My boys got the \"Miga\" eggs and their exact review was: I like these eggs, they are delicious. So there you go - positive reviews from a picky 5 year old.  The adults enjoyed their meals too. I do wish their mimosa glasses were a bit larger - but that is probably just the boozer in me talking. The prices were more than fair. Overall enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here. The service is very poor. The food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe has become one of my favorite places to go for a tasty and affordable breakfast in Phoenix.   The renovated house turned cafe has a great atmosphere, which is perfect whether you are with your family, friends, or on a romantic date.   I prefer weekend brunch items (though they have changed hours lately so be sure to see if they are open first). I have ordered several things and have not been disappointed, though I will admit I have avoided the crabby benedict so no comment on that one.   Breakfast is filling, many of the items come with the rosemary potatoes and fresh fruit.  And Mimosas are $3. Sign me up!  Service is great and I look forward to going back again and exploring more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a favorite.  We've had really excellent experiences here (dinner and brunch)  - except for the most recent one.  The atmostphere is romantic - a cozy old house with cute little rooms, small tables with checked table cloth, soft lighting, the works.  They have fine food that's worth the price and it's a great date night experience.  On this last visit, our server was incredibly slow, beyond reasonable levels. She was nice enough, but we ended up running late for our next engagement, even though we arrived quite early.  She even took over five minutes processing our credit card after we said we were in a hurry, twice.  The restaurant was far from packed fairly early on a Thursday.  The people near us came in later and left earlier with the same number of courses (and a good server).    In addition to being slow, she wasn't very helpful.  We ordered the crab cakes, which came with vegetables that were a little bland, and the stuffed pepper, which was so spicy that my husband and I both burned our mouths.  The server eventually came by and asked how we liked our food, and when we mentioned the screaming spice, she specifically said the dish wasn't meant to be at all spicy - then proceeded to do nothing about it.  Thank goodness another server who had a table nearby kept our waters full.   Our shrimp cocktail appetizer had big, beautiful shrimp, and our creme brulee dessert was delicious.  The crab cakes themselves were great, and I could tell that the pepper dish would have been nice, if it hadn't been so incredibly spicy.  They clearly just forgot to clean out the seeds.  Luckily, my husband and I were in good spirits and the poor service and food issues didn't put a damper on our night.    We've been here many times and tried many menu items, including the crab cake sandwich, the meatloaf, the crab benedict at brunch, their mimosa and bloody mary, etc.  We've never had poor service or over-spicy food before, so I am leaving this review at 4 stars - it's an average of two for this visit and 5 for every other time we've visited."}
{"text":"Super in-expensive food for the grave yard special but service is horrible. Unless I am drunk I don't think I'll be coming back here again. Our server Brett was nice but completely lacked hospitality. We only got to see him once and that's when he dropped off our food. We got a variety of things and they were all pretty good which is why I am giving this place two stars."}
{"text":"Was here a little after midnight for their Late Night Menu Special, we ordered Steak & Eggs and Traditional breakfast. Delicious for the price. We also ordered a stack of pancakes - super thin, slice it in half and it would be like crepes. Lol."}
{"text":"This place is great! The crab cakes are wonderful.  The service was prompt and friendly. The berry bombs are a great specialty cocktail."}
{"text":"Late night specials are great. Cheep Breakfast food and Burgers after midnight. Coffee was not the greatest. DId the trick before the journey back to LA."}
{"text":"I've never been to Maryland, but I'm pretty sure CC marries their best with old school Phoenix's best. I'll start with what I don't like: I don't come often enough. That's it.   My raves: Cutest house turned classy restaurant ever. I've been discovering more & more places like this and CC is by far my favorite. It still feels like walking into mamas kitchen except you get first class service & it's not free ;) Look out for Triple J! Jillian, Janel, & JR always take great care of me!! They all have great attitudes, very personable, and know the menu very well.  You can't go wrong with the crab cakes!! Or the miso salmon, mmmm!! Any seafood really. I've complained about my salmon not being cooked properly at other restaurants but that is not an issue here!! I also love the Gorgonzola salad, chicken Caesar wrap, and meatloaf!!!  As others have mentioned, it's a great date place whether your date is a spouse, friend, or family member. I noticed a lot of people come in before a play- perfect ambiance for a romantic evening.  Get a sitter for the kids- I would give you a Samantha Jones style stare down if you brought in loud grubby children who would definitely ruin my dinner in a cozy place like this. ( I am a nanny who loves children as well as dining out with children. But I also believe in adults having their happy place considering I don't go to the playground with cigarettes & beer to be in the way of 12 & under spring break! Thanks.)  Parking lot works, location is great- super close to I-10, but far enough away to not have the noise while on the patio. Sometimes I come in just for a beer since I am in the neighborhood a lot and just melt into that patio. I'll be back soon! (Maybe tonight!)  *Tip- Call ahead"}
{"text":"Hard to give correct stars.  We were a large group in the back room.  Cute little place.  Great service.  Mixed food experiences.  7 meals were good, two were very disappointing and I would not recommend them at all.  The crab eggs Benedict was awful.  Eggs hard,  hollandaise sauce had no flavor and tasted of flour!  Plus it was not very warm.  Would normally send back to kitchen, but were there right up against closing.  I don't think I'll be going back or recommend it.  If I were closer by, I might give it another try."}
{"text":"We ended up at Coronado Cafe after discovering a huge line and wait at the Studio B buffet at 2:30 PM on a Thursday. Seriously, WTF.  There are signs all over advertising super cheap specials, but those are only available late at night. Pretty much everything is the $10-12 range and there is a $12.99 special for a porterhouse or prime rib. There is also a menu of Chinese food, which seems, um, interesting. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The chicken fried steak itself was really tough and the batter was soggy and greasy. I liked the crispy hashbrowns and the generous amount of gravy, though. Service was just okay, pretty much in line with what Raul T. said below.  The highlight of my meal had to be that a table near us had apparently dined and dashed. It was really weird because it was a pretty big group and it looked like a family. Even security guards came to scope out the scene, although I'm not entirely sure what clues they were looking for. Maybe take fingerprints off the cups??"}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendations of a friend for $3.99 steak and eggs. The deal lasts from 11-6 am so definitely come for a cheap eat. There are no substitutions either.   The thing that I remember the most is that nobody said thank you the entire time I was there. I said hello to the host and all he said back was how many. The guy who took our drink order just stood there and said drinks? Our waiter said what would you like to order. So I am definitely not overexaggerating when I say there was no hellos, no pleasantries, nothing.   It wasn't to just me either. Everyone was equally rude to everybody. Maybe because it was a little before 6 and they were tired. Maybe the smoking gets to you and you become mad at everyone. Whatever the case this place needs a customer service overhaul.   Now I've got that out of the way, the food is decent. The steak was a nice size. I was very pleased for $4. I got it well done and it wasn't burnt. It had a nice charbroiled flavor. I needed to add salt and pepper, but I was very satisfied. The toast was good as well. They came lightly buttered and you can add jelly. I liked them with or without the jelly.   The hashbrowns were amazing! They tasted like they were cooked in butter! I have never had hashbrowns out this good. I traded my eggs for hashbrowns with someone at my table and I was in hashbrown heaven!  I will definitely be back! Even with bad service, nothing comes close to steak, potatoes, eggs AND toast for $4!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, cashier rude and act like they are better than you. Bunch of old ugly Filipino with bad make up."}
{"text":"I got my first visit to the Coronado Cafe last night, and loved it.  I can see how it could be a bit claustrophia-enducing when it's a little more crowded, but luckily we had a little room to ourselves.  I really adored everything about the look and feel of the place.  They had a good sized wine list, and a few girly drinks.  I was torn between 2 wines, and asked the waiter if he had a preference.  I'm pretty sure he made up an answer on the spot, but I give him points for pulling it off smoothly.   Seeing as how I just was incapable of making a decision and just wanted him to act as my coin toss, I was perfectly happy to choose the one he selected, and it was very, very yum.  I had the most delicious salmon, although I can't quite remember how it was prepared.  I only know that I wanted to eat it forever.  My date had a steak that he said was very good as well (yelp it yourself, mister!)  We didn't have dessert... I would have loved to because they looked amazing, but I was stuffed to the gills already.  I actually have the feeling that it would be a really ideal place to just order dessert and wine/coffee, and linger until they hate you, and I will try that soon."}
{"text":"I frequent this place time and time again.  Friends in town?  Lets visit for some 3.95 steak and eggs!  However, it does get quite busy at night, so be prepared to wait in line.  The food isn't bad, especially for what you're paying.  It's kind of hit or miss.  Sometimes it's great sometimes the food is overcooked.  But again, how can you go wrong for the price?"}
{"text":"Decent food at an affordable price. We came to eat here around 1am on a Friday night when we first arrived in Vegas. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery."}
{"text":"A little house filled with delicious food, quaint seating and a cute patio. This pretty much sums of Coronado Cafe. I have been wanting to visit Coronado Cafe for quite awhile now and finally today was the day! This little house also reminds me of a little elf's cottage but in a really cute way.   I like the food and atmosphere here. I tried the veggie wrap with chicken and it had a very delicious vinegar added to it. It was the perfect tough. I really wanted to try the goat cheese salad, but there is always next time!"}
{"text":"You have $20, it is a beautiful day in Phoenix, it is 11:30 and you want brunch?   Coronado Cafe? Yes.  A lazy Saturday morning where Palatte, Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast had been vetoed led us to this charming renovated house. I immediately loved the set up of the out door patio and front porch. The front counter was really quaint-little glass domes for scones and a tiny little glass done that housed one single pastry (!) in a dark wood. We were led over to a four seater in the next room but with all of the sunshine coming in, there was no \"bad\" corner in the place.   Brunch was conveniently placed on one page of the menu and was surprised to see Tofu Scramble listed as an option but decided to risk some dairy for the poached eggs with avocado and blue crab on foccaccia and roasted potatoes and split it with Jared who got the scramble. The other two diners got the traditional Eggs Benedict and liked it.  Both of our shared dishes combined were delicious-mine was really savoury and filling and the tofu scramble with filled with great veggies.   Some hiccups were the eggs dishes potatoes were dried up, but the tofu one had great plump potatoes? Makes me think they did those dishes first and keep them warm for a while.  I asked for hot sauce twice and they served it in one little dish to me, even though everyone had nodded when I asked for it. She offered whole wheat toast to the eggers, and then I found out it was an extra buck for the toast with jam-hmph. Even though the french pressed coffee looked great, I wanted tea and no liquer-and they didn't have a very good selection. In fact our waitress seemed almost confused by my request-she unearthed some peppermint tea, but it was pretty commercial. It was served in a great single server mug/teapot combo though!  Overall, I was totally full but not in a grossed out way and I paid around 16, 17 bucks for my share (including tip and tax and for sharing some of the drink cost). It was a great menu and I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service, despite the hiccups and I really want to try the Seattle Dutch Baby pancakes with fruit-yummers!  ***Update 1/31/09****  Had the Seattle Dutch Baby and it was even BETTER than it looks-simply amazing, doesn't need maple syrup, incredible texture, not overtly sweet, and worth sharing. Also had a Pomosa, the pomegranate of the mimosa variety that was dry and refeshing. Coffee was a huge French Press, which I was surprised by since I was the only one having coffee and I thought they had little French coffee presses? And at 7 bucks, that was a steep two cups of coffee! Make sure to specify how many people are having the coffee is my advise, no biggie. Friendly, fast, relaxed service."}
{"text":"This Cafe has definitely fell off. I had not been in years but most locals had known it for the very good Chinese food.  I had lunch here on 12-26-15,  the food was overpriced! $16.95 for Walnut Shrimp , 6 shrimp on the plate was only  ok, got sick after eating it. I would definitely not eat here again"}
{"text":"The Chinese food is delicious. I had pot stickers ($6.75 for 6) tender, flavorful and delicious! Main entree was crispy chicken ($16.25) I had no idea until the food came IT'S A WHOLE CHICKEN! Husband had wonton soup ($5.75) he said was excellent. His main entree was shrimp and scallops ($24.95) he said it was excellent too. What we ordered was quite expensive for a cafe but there was plenty of less expensive items on the menu. Surprisingly a soda was $3.25 but the servers were constantly refilling the glass. Must acknowledge our server Marlon, excellent friendly server, and knew the menu very well. Will definitely return to try more food."}
{"text":"This place was cozy and romantic, and the food was good. I would imagine parking would be annoying if they were busy. We ordered the crab dip, the fish special of the day, and the salmon wrap. Everything was tasty and the service was good.   The reason for 3 stars is: This place is pretty tiny, so you can expect to hear the entire conversation at the table next to you, even if you don't want to. They were also out of a lot of different things, so while I appreciate only having fresh food, they may need to adjust their ordering to accomodate their whole menu."}
{"text":"Cheap and food is a typical coffee shop. if you are looking for cheap food good service try it. looking for a good meal skip"}
{"text":"i really really really like the personality of this \"newly\" discovered place. the evening temps allowed us to sit and enjoy on the patio.   the owner? greeted us and had a conversation with our dinner companions since they both lived/worked in Maryland at one point, demonstrating to me at least, that he seemed sincerely interested in his clientele.  we shared a crab dip app and i thought it was rich, creamy and delicious. but the problem with sharing an app with some folks is no one likes to take the last few bites, so i wound eating alot of it. i ordered the green chile sauce pasta, however, i was a little disappointed that there was not much green chile flavor/kick to the dish (i'm aware that not all green chile's are fiery hot). my wife's dish, the baramundi special, was much better, albeit a tad heavy on the rice. i also ordered a cup of clam chowder, but had it sent back because it had bacon in it. i don't think clam chowder has bacon in it.  we were comp'd a mixed berry \"cobbler\" desert since a side salad that was ordered was not brought out. it was a huge desert, but rather cakey, and more like a berry shortcake than a cobbler.   overall, a nice little place with a great atmosphere. excellent service and staff. many seafood options for non-meat eaters."}
{"text":"I've only eaten in there after MIdnight, because they have unbelievable specials from 12am-6am.  I get the $4.95 steak and eggs.  It is a 7oz NY Strip, two eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of toast.  It's not the best steak, but for $4.95, it is a bargain and it tastes good.  They normally start lining up around 11:45pm.  But the line moves fast and there is plenty of seating.  The service isn't always the best.  But, you can't beat the price.  And even if you don't want any of the specials, they have a large menu.  Good choice for large groups."}
{"text":"This place is all about cheap late night food and turn over.. and they don't even try to hide it.  So in the interests of full-disclosure, I have never ordered anything outside of the late-night $1.95 - $5.95 menu. Maybe the food quality and service is different if you order of the complete menu, maybe its not, I wouldn't know. Suffice to say, about 90% of the people who are here after midnight are here for the steak and eggs and other specials and the servers know it.  This place is all about turn over. When the average diner is spending less than bucks on their meal, the servers try as hard as they can to get you seated, fed, and out the door. With that being said, if you are looking for actual service that you find at most hotel cafes, look somewhere else. Your server will automatically bring you waters for everyone, and your check before you are even done eating. Once the food has arrived at the table, you are highly unlikely to see your waiter again. To be honest, this doesn't surprise or irk me in the slightest. Every time I come here, I know exactly what to expect. Ok food, cheap prices, and no service. But you do get what you pay for.  The food itself is not spectacular, but its good for the price. Its a perfect place for cheap late night eats. Many of the diners are usually drunk from the dollar drinks at the bowling alley or just got back from a club. Definitely check it out if your in the area and want some cheap late night food."}
{"text":"First time to Vegas and our friends (Vegas residents), took us here after midnight and a night in the Strip for their steak and eggs special. Fabulous. Huge portions and the steaks and eggs are cooked to order. And all for $4.95 a plate -- unheard of in Hawaii. Yes, the restaurant was busy but our server was on it. Bus persons kept soft drink and water glasses refilled without asking. One weird note. The menu says the special is only for those over 21. Huh? My daughter's 17 and taller than me! And, yes, she had the steak-and-eggs special. No problem."}
{"text":"The crab cakes are delicious -- REAL crab and not a lot of filler! Not into crab? The relleno stuffed with veggies and goat cheese and served on polenta is a delicious treat! You can add chicken but it's not necessary... you get two giant peppers!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place. The service is excellent, today's weather is absolutely wonderful. I can't have any complaints about anything. I am having the chicken Caesar wrap with potato salad :) yumzo!"}
{"text":"OK so I came for the midnight special of the $4.95 steak and eggs. There was a bit of a wait but dude for $4.95, I expected there to be a line. We got seated after around 10 minutes. So steak and eggs. Steak is 7oz and probably not going to be cooked the way you want it. I asked for medium rare and got like a medium well. Kind of total opposite of the spectrum but I am not going to complain because I saw this coming for the price. Overall though, even though it wasn't cooked right, the value for what you get is something you can't complain about. You get eggs, steak, hash browns, and toasts. On top of that, the service was pretty good. The server came by several times to ask us if we needed anything. She was kind and I couldn't have asked her to redo the steak.  Other deals also available at night. Would probably not come at other times but maybe the food might be a bit better during non-peak times and not with these value prices. If you are near South Point though at night and looking for a hearty meal, I say go for it! (But don't be ubering here after a night of clubbing on the strip unless u are literally staying at South Point of M Resort...)"}
{"text":"Graveyard special $4.95 steak & eggs from midnight to 6am. Being from Chicago, this fit my normal breakfast routine perfectly. Staff is attentive, glasses seldom reached empty during my 4 day stay.  The $14.95 prime rib special was a nice way to end the grind of the USBC open championships.  Above average service & food for your stay."}
{"text":"I really want to like the food more.  It's good but I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  Not great for large groups, you'll wait a long time.  The few times I've been there the service is harried.  The salads are dependable and good but with more and more places in the Coronado and downtown areas I'd probably go somewhere else first.  Parking is really tough on the tires also."}
{"text":"I stopped by after visiting my mom in the hospital. It was cold and raining, and I needed comfort food. I knew I had heard of this place but could not recall any reviews specifically.   As I walked in from the parking area, I laughed and wondered if the side entrance was actually the front door? THAT is how it was back in Michigan, only salesmen used the front.   I walked in and was greeted by the guy behind the bar. Then greeted by a waiter. They seemed really nice and inviting but the vibe was way off from what I expected. There was no old lady to greet me or ask how my day was. It was a beautiful decor sort of modern and not a cafe at all. I still loved it though.   I ordered the sliders which really should not be called sliders. They were the best mini burgers I have ever had and I love a burger. They were 1/2 inch thick, with caramelized  onion and some fancy blue cheese. They were served with mac n cheese too.   I will be back to try the regular burger but if you go for happy hour the sliders are only 7 bucks or so."}
{"text":"Good food fast and nice people eat between the hours of midnight and 0600 am it's less than $5 steaks"}
{"text":"So the Coronado cafe is best if you need dinner before a movie at south point. It's is also a very cheap late night spot. Food and service are ok. Nothing to scream about. This is a place to grab a cheap bite if your not in a mood for anything fancy. Do not expect to be blown away but if all goes well you should leave satisfied"}
{"text":"My husband and I met some friends at Coronado Cafe today for lunch before venturing to the Heard Museum. I'd driven by Coronado quite a few times on my way to Lisa G's for lunch and had been wanting to try it, and boy am I glad we finally did! It was a great lunch place...quite a nice selection of salads and sandwiches.  Plus, any place that has $5 glasses of wine is A-OK in my book. I ordered the half chicken caesar sandwich and a small field salad...both were delicious...my half sandwich was huge, so I was glad I hadn't ordered the full one.  The chicken was nice and moist and the caesar dressing had a hint of spice, which was a nice surprise.  My husband ordered a burger and thought it was delicious...he said it's the best burger he has had in quite a while.  It was a tad small inside, but it was a cute and charming restaurant, so I barely noticed how close we were to the tables next to us.  I'm definitely telling my co-workers about Coronado, so we can add it to our lunch rotation. Coronado Cafe is 10 times better than Lisa G's (a place one of my co-workers insists on going frequently), which is right down the street.  The brunch menu looks quite good, so I'm going to drag my husband back on a Saturday morning sometime to try it out."}
{"text":"**EXCELLENT BRUNCH SPOT ON N 7TH STREET**  Sure, there were some other brunch options on N. 7th Street . . .  BUT Coronado Cafe was certainly the BEST choice.  Stopped by Saturday at 11AM and was immediately seated in the patio area.  Loved the country cottage concept.  Very friendly and all-smiles staff.  Good energy and vibe.  ORDERED:  *MIMOSA ($3) Refreshing, good quality and nicely-priced.  *CRABBY BENEDICT ($10) The perfectly poached eggs on top of toasted Foccacia bread, some crabby sweet meat, well-balanced Hollandaise sauce, and accompanied with country potatoes and a small bowl of fresh fruit was indeed the ideal brunch entree.  *CARIBBEAN BREAD PUDDING (price N/A) Heavenly carb goodness with rum that was irresistible. Good flavors which were not too sweet. Went perfectly with a cup of coffee.  I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience here.  Excellent ambiance, good food, friendly customer service, and recessionista prices.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Disappointingly I can't leave 0 stars on this review. As petty as that may sound. I'm truly disgusted with the service as well as the quality of food. I am a night owl. So a must is always the mid night special. I get the medium rare steak with scrambled eggs and sour dough bread dry with a hot water (water is free). I've been coming here since I was 16 and it's seriously sad to watch such a beloved cafe become sooo poor in food quality! Service has always been terrible but never their quality of food! They always made up for the long waits with the deliciousness! But recently. Coronado cafe has dramatically taken a turn for the worst. Their steak is no longer a decent size nor does it hold the flavor a steak should, the hash browns are smashed potatoes that a baby would think is play food, and the eggs are still soggy with yolk? (I thought scrambled meant no yolk?) BUT the ultimate deal breaker was how disrespectful the cashier was. Since I get the same order every time I was baffled by them charging me 4 dollars for a \"hot tea\" (I OBVIOUSLY had my own vibrant tea package). & when I addressed the issue with the cashier she blamed me for the \"miscommunication\" due to not discussing the issue with the waitress who only delivered my food once, never hearing from her again (Dora was her name).  Correct me if I'm wrong but charging me for an item that I brought is unrealistic. & ever since when was the customer wrong? Customer service was bafflingly pathetic and inexcusable. As for a customer coming back any time soon? I am not in that category any longer. I truly hope that this cafe improves. They're losing such valuable locals. I sure won't be back any time soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here...move on.  Coronado Cafe has been around for a few years and is decidedly worse now than it was last time I visited in 2009.  The menu has been \"updated\" to include a wide variety of seafood, middle eastern and American fare.  Whereas in the past there were 2 or 3 signature dishes that made Coronado Cafe Stand out, now the menu options are standard fare that is available in 50 other restaurants in Phoenix.  As for those who have said that the Coronado Cafe is romantic...I fully disagree. In the past the lighting was lower and the decor was such that one could have a romantic one on on dinner but now the lighting has been turned up full tilt and the decor has been mid westernized...with checkerboard table clothes and more tables crowded into the restaurant than before.  As a result the clientele at Coronado Cafe is now retirement age for the most part and is composed of larger groups on the Saturday night we went versus couples"}
{"text":"Hells yeah.. steak and eggs for less than $5. The food is delicious here, the burgers are huge, the blt is bomb!! Went here with my kids and my sisters and cousins we ate for just about $100 and there was 12 of us. They have different types of food. Only its freaken packed always!! Service is ok... but THE PRICE IS RIGHT"}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast during football season. We noticed a decline in service at the end of last season. First game the year, and the service is still slow. Food is what I expect for a local casino, average."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  I had the crabby benedict and the banana nutella crepe and both were great!  Will be back to try more things."}
{"text":"The line to get seated is always long even though there are tables available. Once you've ordered your food will take a while to get there. But honestly, I really cant complain since their steak and eggs are only $3.95 and it is the best after a drunken outing on the strip."}
{"text":"i really don't know why everyone loves this place... because i had the WORST salmon of my life here. yuck! as i was choking down my $22.50 charred salmon (not grilled, charred), i was thinking, and THIS is why i don't order fish in Phoenix. at any rate. the gigantic ravioli was ok. the pasta part was a little on the undercooked side, but the mascarpone/goat cheese filling was pretty tasty. and the cook apparently forgot to put the dumplings in the chicken and dumplings soup that night...  aside from the tasty filling, i was sorely left wanting. i had been looking forward to eating at this place! it definitely has a cute, romantic ambiance, but if you have bad eyesight you might need a flashlight to read the menu.   the waitstaff was nice enough, i guess... but our waiter didn't apologize when he accidentally bumped into a couple of my friends. several times. not to mention we sat there and waited and waited and waited for our bill -and then found out that the waitress was busy making drinks for other customers... which is why we waited a good 20+ minutes for our bill. i actually ended up taking our bill to the register bc the waiter kept walking past us without taking it.   in short, i was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a Realtor and I had recently finished showing a Buyer Townhomes and Condos in Downtown Phoenix. I was looking for a good healthy place for lunch, and I of course pulled out my phone and turned to Yelp for their recommendations. Coronado Cafe came up as one of the highest ranked in the area and they did not disappoint.  Located within a 1920's built house this charming cafe served up some of the best lunch time fare that I've had in sometime. Not only that but they have wonderful Bloody Marys that were only $3. I went with a half sandwich and side salad. My sandwich was the Pest Chicken and it was delicious as was the salad. My business partner is from Baltimore and when he heard the waiter state that they have the best crab cakes in town he naturally ordered them. He, being an expert on crab, was immediately transported back home with his first bite. After speaking with the owner we discovered that he too is from Baltimore and has the crabs flown in special for his crab cakes. So if you're a crab cake lover or simply a lover of good food Coronado Cafe is a must stop for you."}
{"text":"Good solid breakfast, especially if you order before 6 am. Wife had steak and eggs for $4.95. Nice variety of other breakfast items including pancakes waffles and grits. A definite go to at South Point Hotel."}
{"text":"I'm in town with some friends and they chose Coronado Cafe for dinner. I have the Edamame with Garlic Seasoning and it was FANTASTIC! I also had the Seafood Tofu Soup and OH MY GOSH!!!! It's a definite recommendation to anyone who loves seafood! Not very expensive at all!!!!! With tons of different seafood chucks! With TWO crab claws and FOUR jumbo shrimp! I'm so full!! The seafood is very very very pricy here but the soup was only $9 and there was soooooo much of it!!"}
{"text":"Eggshells in omelets? Really? They said it came from a carton, but then I said that unless it's powdered, the liquid had to come from something with a shell.  Nevertheless, they made another one with the expectation that crunching on eggshells wouldn't ruin ones appetite. Wrong- didn't eat the second one just for that reason and they didn't bother to remove it from the bill.  Party of 6. One was satisfied: pancakes.  Won't come back again (and we're locals)! It's unfortunate for the tourists."}
{"text":"Went their tired and hungry. Porterhouse steaks only $14.95 and big. Much better quality than Green Valley Ranch $10 special at coffee shop. Comes with salad and baked potato. Also, $5 house wine was very relaxing. Service almost excellent. Why don't servers bring wine when they bring the water and other guests drinks. It's nice to enjoy a Merlot before dinner and sip it. Tried the $4.95 steak and eggs excellent but beware coffee is $3.25 like Starbucks."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots after midnight after a night out or when friends are in town. Can't beat $4.95 steak and eggs and  other cheap meals available after midnight."}
{"text":"Have eaten in this cafe a number of times and I would rate the café as three stars. However, they advertise \"great Chinese\" food. so I decided to try some. First the food is overpriced for what you get. I ordered \"scallops in a sechwan sauce\" for $16.99. What I got was a few scallops dredged in heavy flour then lightly deep-fried. Then the scallops were mixed into a sweet/sour(red) sauce (mostly sickly sweet) so the breading got soggy and was peeling off the scallops. Overcooked vegetables were then thrown into the mixture to end up with a bad TV dinner on my plate. My suggestion is that the café either get a chef or dump the Chinese food."}
{"text":"Overall an underwhelming experience. We were lured by the low prices but forgot the old saying, you get what you pay for. My $7.95 flat iron steak with blue cheese crumble was as flavorless as it gets. There were only a few little chunks of blue cheese. The mashed potatoes were as plain as they comes. To top t all off, it came with a scoop of peas. What is this, a school cafeteria? I've had worse meals but this ranks right up there. My wife had a Ruben. I've seen 5 year olds make better looking sandwiches. The corned beef was dry and boring and the bread was a joke. The potato salad was crusty, like it had been sitting around all day.  I read many reviews about how great the midnight specials are, apparently that is the only time they care about their customers. When the waitress asked how our meal was, I replied that the food was bland and tasteless. She replied with, \"sorry about that\" and walked away. She came back with the check about 20 minutes later.  Who cares about customer service when you have this many thousands of customers each day.  Do yourself a favor, stick to the local restaurants and avoid the common casino cafes. This one is at the top of my list of the worst casino cafes in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was on my way in to stay at South Point and was hungry. It was breakfast time and I was thinking the ihop down the street but decided to give this place a try.  I had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Lets be clear, this is a diner, nothing special or fancy but it is tasty and reasonably priced.  I ate twice here, breakfast was lox and scrambled eggs and the next day lunch was a turkey burger. I would say both meals were better than I expected.    I would probably go here again if I was in the area and wanted a quick no frills meal.  I put it in the same category as ihop, Denny's or Cocos but better than all of them. And they are conveniently located in the middle of the casino floor.   They are open 24 hours and have some great late night deals."}
{"text":"Great value mid night special!!!! Love this place. Only $3.95 for 7 oz steak, I go there everyday."}
{"text":"Delicious small sized comfort food as well as healthy options. The mac n cheese is a must."}
{"text":"Serves its purpose...decent food at a cheap price!! Great stop for when the party ends and you are hungry but spent all of your money on drinks or gambling!   Typical cafe/coffee shop style food, service was pretty good and the wait wasn't too long at 3am.   Would I make it a regular spot and go out of my way to frequent? Probably not. Would I go back? Sure, if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe has character!  What a nice change from the strip mall restaurants that make up most of the Valley.  It's a cute little house, friendly enough staff, and pleasant menu as well.  I've been twice so far and was pleased both times.  Once, awhile back, for dinner - Jared and I sat outside (it was obviously not the summer) and had a delightful little date... If I recall, we had one of their homemade soups and a fish special of the day.    Most recently, I met Katie F there for a perfect girlfriend/business lunch.  We met on a Thursday at noon.  I actually arrived a bit early but they will not seat you unless the full party is there.  Not a problem, I had a refreshing raspberry iced tea while i waited.  We were seated promptly when Katie arrived - in a back room that was quiet enough to talk and actually hear each other!  Katie went with the chicken pasta and I opted for the Cobb Salad (I was told it is the newest addition to the menu).  We were both happy with our meals and practically cleaned our plates.  The dressing for the Cobb has a kick; be forewarned, but I enjoyed it.  We didn't leave room for dessert, but the menu was tempting.    Thanks Coronado Cafe for bringing some character to the Valley - I'll be back to see you soon!"}
{"text":"The SW wrap is amazing! It's a touch on the expensive side at $11 though. The salads are very good too."}
{"text":"Funny how I don't have a review up for the Coronado Cafe yet, because I am always here! South Point is the closest casino to my house and it has everything that I need in an entertainment spot (for a separate review) and a plus for me is the Coronado Cafe. There is something for everyone here.   What keeps me coming back and loving them is their 24/7 Porterhouse Special. When I am hungry for a steak, this is the first place that I think of. For the price of $12.95, you get a big, beautiful steak cooked to your liking, a choice of soup or salad for your side, two decent sized onion rings, and garlic bread. Doesn't that sound like a great meal for that price? If you're a late bird, I have many friends who are fans of their late night steak and eggs prices.   My family sticks to ordering from the Chinese menu when they are here and my personal favorites are the fried sea bass entree, Wor Wonton Soup, and the Peking duck (ask for extra baos). The portions are big and you will most likely want to share! I am not a fan of the desserts here since both times I ordered the cheesecake and the Brownie Delight, it wasn't very good.   As for the service, there are good days and mediocre days, but I have never had bad service from any of the servers here.   They will continue to have my business :)"}
{"text":"The service was pretty okay especially when 5 servers are standing all together conversing nearby your table.The food on the other hand was not good at all especially if you have Chinese food! Moreover, the pricing on the Chinese food was too expensive for the poor quality unfortunately. It's Vegas and normally it'd be cheap, but the (Chinese) food was *sorry* awful! P.S. Please learn how to make steamed rice correctly!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here two times in the last two days and the food and service was outstanding!  The Prime Rib special is well worth the $14.99 price.  The breakfast omelette was very good!  The service has been exceedingly polite and quick.  I will be back for another meal!"}
{"text":"$4.95 for a steak and egg breakfast? Amazing! Probably one of the best casino breakfast deals I've ever seen! And for the food to actually be good? Even better.   Their late night/early morning menu is awesome. $2.95 for biscuits and gravy? I mean, why wouldn't one go here for breakfast? The service was friendly and the food came out very quickly. No, it's not a gourmet restaurant but for what it is, it's great. My scrambled eggs were flavorful and cooked just right. The steak was probably not the best cut of steak but they cooked it the way I liked it and with a little A1 it was pretty good. We had to get the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they were better than at most places. Loved their marinara sauce.   I wouldn't hesitate to go back for a cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"Considering the fact that we showed up at 1 in the morning, I was just happy to find something to eat. Little to no wait is always a good thing. We ordered 2 burger specials for about $8. Great price in the wee hours of the morning. I've been told they have really good Chinese food, we'll have to see about that next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here after the Indian Nationals Rodeo event that the South Point was hosting.  Well, the service was TERRIBLE.  One guy took our drink order and another took our food order.  The salad part came before the drinks!    We got Mozarella Sticks and they were served lukewarm...and we got a chicken dish that we split that was also lukewarm.  I personally like my food to be hot...so I know that it was just freshly cooked and not hanging around the back!  But that's just me.    The only redeeming thing about this place was their prices.  They weren't very expensive so that was good.  I guess if you are at the South Point late at night with no other options than this place will work...other than that I will find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"We stayed @ South Point Hotel/ Casino last week for business.  We ate here several times.  The food is good.  I like their breakfast.  Had a variety of egg dishes during the few days we were there:  Over medium, scrambled, poached w/ bacon or corned beef hash.  Food always came out hot. One thing we really like here are the midnight specials.  The line was REALLY long, but worth the wait.  We had steak (NY strip) and eggs and hashbrowns and toast for $3.95!  There are other great cheap choices from midnight to like 5 am.  I think it is called the Taxi Cab menu.  Since this is the only restaurant open 24/7, we ate here often."}
{"text":"There are plenty of reviews to demonstrate the fortitude and cache of Coronado Cafe, so I will simply say that this is a sweet little spot for a lunch date.   My girlfriend and I had our second date here as one of those safe, sans alcohol, 'is this the one?' dates, which came off perfectly and pleasantly and I looked like the f'in man for suggesting it.  Sucker.  Just kidding.  I love you baby.  Heh."}
{"text":"I had a really positive experience here with my fam bam. As a native of Vegas, I've always wanted to experience late night steak and eggs but never got the opportunity to do so until one fateful night in June. I rallied up the troops, some of which were reluctant to get food at 12 am. But who can beat $4.95 N.Y. Steak with two eggs, hash browns, and toast? Graveyard specials like this are what make Vegas so iconic.   It's not easy to serve a large and rowdy party of 7 at 12 am but Sherita did it with humor and finesse. Pretty sure we got some looks from other patrons for being overly giggly, energetic, and waaaay too excited over everything. My brother was trying hard to sweet talk Sherita into letting the under 21 members of our party get the steak and egg special but Sherita held strong and had a good laugh at my bro's feeble attempts to convince her. Food quality exceeded my expectations. To be honest, I wasn't expecting a very flavorful steak given the price tag of our meal, but the steak was seasoned well and cooked to my liking. And nothing beats dipping some sourdough toast into sunny side up egg yolk. Add some crispy hash browns and some ketchup+tapatio and I am one happy camper.  Given our experience, this may become an annual tradition for my family. We can't always be together due to distance, but when we are, it's always a hoot. Coronado Cafe made our time together even more special."}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast, and the coffee is good too. Excellent service, portions are large. I ordered the steak and eggs, everything was cooked to perfection! my husband had the strawberry waffle, it was light and fluffy piled with whipped cream and strawberries, yummy."}
{"text":"Never sat on the patio before...  Love that it is November and we can sit outside and enjoy the weather!  The staff is super friendly and always aiming to please.    I ordered the Blanco Flatbread (roasted garlic cream, mozzarella, parmesan-reggiano, and added roasted chicken).  Less the onions for me on this.  It is crispy, light, and delish!  I tried a slice of the Carne Flatbread from Shane's plate.  YUM!!!  The spicy was the right amount."}
{"text":"My spoon had salad on it! No, I didnt use it! Yuck! Service is too damn slow! Ughhhhh"}
{"text":"The Coronado Cafe seems to be real hit or miss based on the reviews below.  I can understand some of the points on the misses, but for me, it was a hit.  PHX seems to be populated with several of these former houses turned restaurants/bars.  I'm a fan of their eclecticism.  It makes for a fun, intimate setting more often than not.  My dinner was tasty and cooked to perfection - no qualms there. But the wait staff was super meh.  I'm not a regular at semi-upscale places, but when I am, I certainly shouldn't have to pour my own wine.  It just seems declasse. And while we were the last two people in the place on a Thursday night, there was some definite tension in the room to get us to leave.  I don't know how long we were there after they technically closed, but it was a tad awkward.  So factoring in my experience with the rest of the reviews, Coronado sounds hit or miss.  But if you manage to get the right chef and right waiter combo, it could approach a five star experience. Who doesn't like a little gambling?"}
{"text":"Fast thru the waiting line, fast to take our order. Descent time for our food to come. Great Server. And you cant beat the later night breakfast specials. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Straight up \"diner\" food, nothing really special but they do have A LOT of options in their menu (far more than Denny's and especially other Hotel Breakfast spots) For example, Breakfast: pancakes, waffles, omelettes, oatmeal, assorted cold cereals, bagels and lox. Lunch: salads, wraps, burgers, salads, etc & Dinner fare of Meatloaf, Salmon, plus a 12oz Porterhouse Special of 12.95 that includes a baked potato, garlic toast, a couple onion rings.. the whole shabang.   All of these meals are fairly priced, good tasting and a life saver restaurant to go to while staying at South Point because it can fulfill everyone's cravings with all the choices.   They also have a \"Chinese\" section. Looking at the menu even I agree that its very expensive but I have tried some of the Dishes.   -The wonton soup is $6 for a little cup, it was bland and not worth it.  -The Shrimp w/Lobster sauce was $20 but the shrimp were HUGE and it was quite tasty.. but I don't think it's still worth the hefty price tag.  -The Pan Fried Noodles deluxe, however, is my most favorite dish to order off their Chinese Menu. Its under 13 and very delicious.   You MUST try their after midnight menu too for their Steak and eggs for $4.99! The steak's not the finest cut, but c'mon steak and eggs and hashbrowns AND toast for under 5 bucks... c'mon!"}
{"text":"I liked it.  Aside from the loud business man behind us (keep your work at work or outside please).  The building is perfect for the Coronado hood and we were greeted with a smile and friendly hello.   I really enjoyed the Brie and Lavosh, very tasty.  My wife had the roasted chicken sandwich and Gorgonzola salad, I had a bite and it was delicious.  I enjoyed the Cafe burger and side salad, the burger was cooked to order and the balsamic vinaigrette was amazing.  Thank you Coronado Cafe, we will be back.  P.S.  Be prepared for a gravel drive, all you ladies in high heels."}
{"text":"I work an awkward graveyard shift, and its difficult to find good restaurants open at 5am. I heard about the Coronado cafe's graveyard special at the south point hotel, and Since south point is less than five minutes from my job, i decided to go check it out.   Firstly, I was shocked to see the prices for the graveyard special. less than $4  for new york steak and eggs?!? Omg. Not only were they inexpensive, but they were delicious. My taste buds and my wallet were dancing with joy!   Secondly, the service is very good. I waited less than 10 minutes to receive my food and the staff was super friendly; my waiter came around every so often to refill my drink or to make sure everything was alright. He had good timing, not like some waiters who come to your table every five seconds, while you're chewing your food to ask if you need anything else. Or like some waiters who bring you your food, and you don't see them again till it's time to pay.  All I'm saying is, that Coronado cafe is my go to spot for grabbing good breakfast after work. Annnd, you should go give it a try =]"}
{"text":"Not the best all night casino cafe in Las Vegas, but you'll get feed.  I expect better prices, but I guess I'm just used to the cafe at the Orleans Casino."}
{"text":"This place is great. It is set up in a little house with a really cute atmosphere. They have a great patio and a fantastic personality.   I was there for lunch and had a tuna melt. It was good, but the side of mac and cheese was the best!!! I want to go back and try some of their crab cakes/crab dip (they tout their crab here as being the best around), and of course a side of mac and cheese. The seating is a bit close together and the prices are a little high, but it is great for an occasional lunch or special occasion."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying don't waste your money here. The food is not very good. It's immersed and dripping with oil (I ordered an omelet), the flavor is akin to something from a can or powder, the water tastes like salt water, the tables are very small and have little room for eating. My wife and I had to wait nearly 30 mins (even after the food arrived) for a booster seat for our daughter and we asked for one right when we got to our table and even when we ordered our food. Staff walk around shouting to patrons \"I'll be right with you in just a minute\" and having them wait nearly 10 mins after that for the waiter to ask what you'd like to drink. We had a horrible waitress and had to basically rely on the table bust boy to get anything done. The aroma is very strong of the smell of a portable bathroom. There's no smoking obviously but that doesn't matter because the slots are right next to the restaurant and smoke billows right into the eating area. They say their soup is home made but it is very obvious it is right out of a can. All around a very unpleasant experience here. Only one star for the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"\"This a 24 hour eatery inside South Point.  We had their House Specials.  Dad had their 10 oz. cut of Prime Rib, slow roasted for full flavor.  Mom, Robert and I had their 16 oz. Porterhouse Steak both meals are only $14.95 and are accompanied by a cup of soup or dinner salad and a baked potato, fries or french fries.  Our meats were perfect!  They have a gracious staff too.  Marlon and Jerseycate treated us very well, kudos to them!   The kicker is this great food is served 24/7. We'll be back!  This was only a small part of their generous menu.  When you don't want the hassle of the Vegas Strip check out South Point for food, gambling and they have an AMC theatre inside also.  Who could ask for more?\""}
{"text":"On a recent visit with my family, I was very happy with our service. I cannot remember our waiter's name but he was probably the most helpful one I've ever encountered on my visits here.   I have a younger cousin who is allergic to shellfish and when my Aunt was trying to order him chicken fingers, he kindly warned us against it because apparently they cook/fry the seafood and everything deep-fried on the same grill/fryer. He gave them plenty of other alternative options and was very knowledgable. He also double-checked on a lot of the foods to make sure it was safe for my cousin to eat. Later on the manager approached us and I'm guessing he told her about our situation and apologized for the inconvenience and pretty much repeated what our waiter had already mentioned about the grill.   At first I was kind of upset that they couldn't maybe just get a separate pan or something to cook his chicken fingers in but our waiter was really informative and nice about everything, I was just glad he mentioned this rather than my cousin have a terrible reaction.  I'm still not a HUGE fan of the food here other than $4.95 steggs hence the 4-star rating but I was really pleased with the service :)"}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally got here to see what all the \"excitement\" was about.  Arrived at 4a on a Saturday, there was no line, but it was busy.  Surprised at the number of servers (there were a lot, all over the place).  I ordered the steak and eggs (pik attached).  I asked for the eggs \"omelet\" style, was advised they could not do that for the graveyard special. Took about 10m to get it... total price with tax for the graveyard steak and eggs, $5.35.  It was just \"ok\", I certainly would not make a special trip here again for it.  I ordered the steak medium rare and can't say it was juicy.  Was dry and chewy.  But for the price...  Comparing this place to Ellis Island or any of the Village Pubs, they charge $7.56 for their steak and eggs, and the steak there is considerably better.  The Village Pubs, not Ellis Island (even though they have the same owner), have much better potatoes.  If I was looking for \"a deal\" on steak and eggs, I'd go to any of the Village Pubs, followed by Ellis Island, followed by Coronado Cafe (a very distant third)."}
{"text":"Woh hoppen -- maybe this was a fluke?   I had a hunch we were in trouble when there was only one car in the parking lot on a Friday night, and the menu was enclosed in a plastic sheet such as you'd put a composition in.   It took us 45 minutes for our sandwiches to arrive (no big deal as we weren't in a hurry), and they were just \"okay.\"  Again, there was only one other party in the place.  Coincidentally, the next night (Saturday at 8:00 we went across the street to get pie at Coco's...and there were no  cars in the Coronado parking lot at all.   Come to think of it, I should have been suspicious when I called 4 days before Valentine's day  and they were wide open for reservations.  (We had to cancel at the last minute.)  I'm not one to bad-mouth restaurants and, believe me, we always loved the Coronado...saved it for special occastions.  Something is wrong here."}
{"text":"Unbelievable little gem. ..I had the portobello sandwich with a side Caprese and a side of mac n cheese (just had to) & my love had the crab cake benedict! Only because I'm a small Eater did I take some to go and ordered dessert (Omg key lime pie)... You must stop! !!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant not kid friendly... service is horrible!!! Too bad I didn't get the waiter's name but man... he doesn't care at all!! Went here for cheap late nite special and big boys to play the tables after but lost our appetites and left the place. Went to Marilyn's cafe... they have late nite especial too and much better service!!!!!! Rather go to Marilyn's for their $6 steak and eggs and all you can eat pancakes!! So forget about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Bland, blah generic food. Went today for their \"great\" Chinese food. Horrible and very overpriced for it. The scallops and shrimp Szechwan were soggy breaded yuck in sweet and sour sauce. The accompanying egg roll was greasy and soggy. Won't bother with eating at South Point again as have been disappointed by every restaurant we have tried here. Only decent food has been salads; at the snack bar at the bowing alley, the Del Mar deli and the oyster bar."}
{"text":"WTF!  WTF!?!   So what does Suge Knight, bad service and awesome hot buffalo sauce have in common?  Well they were all at the Coronado Cafe late last night.  As we are seated by the grumpy host who tossed the menus on the table and walked away a man behind us gets up with two chicken heads.  He's tall, stocky etc.  I playfully say to the hubby that guy looks like Suge Knight and he says that is him.  So weird, I wanted to ask him if he had anything to do with Tupac and/or Biggies deaths, too surreal.  Only in Vegas I suppose. So the service here was awful, I do not believe I have never not left a tip before.  First the waitress, an older Asian lady came and asked us, 'what u want,' then we proceeded to wait and wait for our buffalo wings, we had no drinks, no napkins and when we asked for dressing she came and threw the dish on the table.  I was just shocked because she was do bad, she was obsessing over her big table and could care less of the rest.   I've been here many times and think they have the best buffalo sauce ever, I only wish they fried them naked.  They also have really good late night specials for really cheap from midnight to 6am.  The service has always been decent except for last night.  And it always hits the spot after a night of partying and drinking."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs for $3.95?  Yes, please!! And no, its not snack size, its a hearty meal they serve!  Only thing is it's from 12am-6am but in Vegas, who really sleeps anyway?    The food is not only cheap but it tastes good and definitely leaves you full.  Located in South Point Hotel, its the only restaurant they have that's open 24 hours so it's always got people no matter what time or day.  Wait wasn't long, 20 minutes at the most but the servers can do a little better.  They were either grumpy or forgetful. I'll cut some slack only because it was 3 in the morning and they have to work but at least smile!      Clam chowder was delicious and the burger and fries for $2.95 were just as good!  This is one place I'll definitely be coming back to when I hit Vegas again."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and I was very impressed. The service was excellent! I got a breakfast burrito and it was delicious! Also the hash browns are very tasty! I'm definitely coming back the next time I stay at South Point."}
{"text":"I usually come here for the late night Steak & Eggs.  Good eats for the price of $4.95. Can't beat that right? Well,  service is not the best and I experienced the worst of it on my last visit.   I understand it was a busy Saturday night and I wasn't in a rush so I calmly waited for the waitress to take my order at the bar. I already know what I was going to order. A five minutes later a gentleman sat next to me and we talked while waiting to get taken cared of. The waitress finally  comes up and asked the gentleman what he wants to order. He so kindly tells her that I was here 1st.  I order my meal Steak (Medium Well) & Eggs (Scrambled) with Wheat Bread.  Gentleman next to me orders the same but with his Steak rare.   After awhile the woman comes up with the Gentleman's food 1st and said my food will be coming shortly.  I did get my food in about 2 minutes.  I begin eating my steak is REALLY RARE! I ask the gentleman next to me and he says he thinks our steaks got mixed up.  I ask for another steak and got it after the gentleman next to me has already left. The steak was thinner than the last one and WELL OVER WELL DONE! Ate half of it and lost my appetite. This was the worst experience I've had here! NO TIP!"}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe was one of the first restaurants I was able to walk to in Phoenix, so I had quite a bit of pep in my step walking down 7th Street from my new pad.    It is an adorable little spot, with the patio calling to me just a bit (much too hot to listen, though).  The sandwiches are really flat bread pizzas, but quite tasty.  Our service blew just a little bit (read Tyler B's review for more on that).    I'll definitely be back to Coronado Cafe with even more pep in my step, hoping for the service to be what I want it to be."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food at a reasonable price. The ambiance it wonderful. Very cute and comfortable atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new and unique place to eat."}
{"text":"I heard they the best Steak and Egg's in Las Vegas for the cheapest price of $4.95. I had to try it. I came here with a party of 15+ people.  The line was super long and we waited for about 45mins. I wasn't upset about that since it was a 3 day weekend. Once we sat down, we ordered the special and the server George was horrible. He was so rude!   When we got our steaks, I asked for mine to be medium and when I got my steak it was like beef jerky. When I told my server about the tempura of my steak he argued about me and said I wanted Medium-well. I explained to him, even if I did want a medium-well steak, this is WELL DONE! He rolled his eyes and took my steak away.   I just told him, I lost my appetite and don't want it anymore. Out of the 15 of us there, maybe 4 of them had the right steak temperature.    I guess that's what you get for late night $4.95 steak special. ..  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"My bf and I ate here 3 times during a recent stay at South Point. Typical diner food type of menu - but still tasty and fresh.   I had the Cowboy Special Omelet (which was yum!) and the Huevos Rancheros which was also pretty good.   Twice my bf got the South Point Special (it was called something like that.. with eggs, potatoes, cheese, and ham or bacon) -- I ordered it one of the times too -- it was good.. and A LOT of food (mostly potatoes). I think I only finished half of mine.  Their coffee is perhaps better than I expected from a diner in a casino. We had many cups.   They have separate beverage servers because of how high volume they are - there's often a line during the breakfast/lunch times. Service was pretty quick, considering every table was full every time we went."}
{"text":"Came here at 4am for $5 steak and eggs! Pretty good when you're having the drunchies. Comes with hash brown, and toast too.  My friend and I shared a plate but they hooked it up with an extra egg. :)   Special prices start midnight - 6am"}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs for breakfast today. It came with eggs hash browns and toast for under 10 bucks. This special is alot cheaper if you eat between midnight and 6 in the morning.  Steak was juicy, the eggs were fluffy and the hash browns were crispy.  We were seated right away and served drinks right after. The service was prompt and courteous. It's a good spot to get breakfast. We were here at about 630 in the morning. It started getting busy around 730.  I would recommend this place for there graveyard specials between midnight and 6 in the morning. When you reach in your pocket and find out you dont have enough for the minimum bet but barely haves enough to tip the waitress, at least you can get a decent meal under 5 bucks. Then call it a night."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, perfect for a date night. Great food! Talked to the owner for a bit as well, great guy, very friendly and passionate about central Phoenix. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino, this place is fantastic! We went for breakfast on a weekday and thought the line might take forever, but it moved very quickly. Service was really great. They have a two person system that works well and I am sure is the reason they get people moved through quickly and smoothly. I ordered the standard breakfast of two eggs (over easy), bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast. I cut my eggs up and mixed them in with my hash browns. So. Good. The other thing I must mention is their coffee. It's delicious!! My friend had the corned beef hash and liked it also. They also have unbelievable deals late night from 12 AM - 6 AM. I highly recommend you check this place out for late night eats or breakfast!!"}
{"text":"back at south point again this year for my sons team basketball tourney. last year we didnt eat here but im sure glad we did this year. me, my son and my mom ate here three times during our stay. we had lunch the first time and i got a loco moco. it was good, not great. think the chinese rice rather then sticky rice kept it from being great. the second time we had dinner. chinese food this time. i got the mongolian beef. it was great. i was very surprised. my son had the orange chicken and that was great too. the last meal was lunch again. i had a blt. it was really good. i was happy to see more bacon then lettuce.i should have had avocado in it, i think that would have taken it over the top. great place thats clean with amazing service."}
{"text":"Great local option for a quick breakfast while staying at the hotel. Typical diner and diner options but also late night dining and deals. I hear they are great but I didn't try any of them. Staff was courteous and friendly.  Not bad but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great food and pricing is reasonable, and the graveyard specials after midnight for 21 and up are really yummy! Get the $5 Steak and Eggs!"}
{"text":"Over a year later I still give this place 5 stars.  Their crab cakes are amazing!  My boss took me to lunch and I suggested this place.  He's from Maryland so he loved that they use Maryland crab.    One bit of warning - the bowl of clam chowder is HUGE!  It could be a meal by itself.  I recommend sharing with a friend or order a cup instead."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for an off-strip meal if you're not super picky, or if you want a late night meal.  It's open 24/7 which is good.  I mean, this is Vegas after all!    There was a moderate line when I visited on a weekday evening around 6pm.  Waiting time was about 15-20 minutes.  The restaurant is basically just a large, permanently sectioned off area off the lobby rather than a discrete, enclosed restaurant.  This gives it a very open, airy feeling.  But, if you're sitting near the edge you'll basically be right next to people walking through the lobby.  Our server had a very surly demeanor initially (I think she meant this to be part of her charm maybe) though she warmed up a bit as the evening progressed.  They do have a number of very good specials for late night dining (see photo), but we were not there during the wee hours.    We tried the spicy wings to start which were basic but definitely very spicy.  Not bad.  Then I had the schnitzel.  The meat itself was quite good and was juicy with a light and crispy coating, but it was doused in a very heavy sauce which I wasn't expecting based on the description on the menu.  I should've asked for it on the side.  My bad.  For dessert I tried the blueberry pie which was quite good.  Lots of blueberries and a very tasty crust.    So, overall this was a perfectly decent meal with nothing particularly good or bad about it.  If you're hungry at 2:00am as you stroll through Southpoint, though, you might find the Coronado Cafe a welcome respite."}
{"text":"Perfect Day, Perfect Brunch, Perfect Place.  Yes that would be at the Coronado Cafe.   Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and was pleased to see that they offered brunch as well as lunch.   Every thing sounded so goo it was hard to decide but I ended up getting a brunch item, the Crabby Benedict (see pics) which was two poached eggs over toasted focaccia, topped with blue crab, avocado, & hollandaise, served with café potatoes & fresh fruit.   Our food arrived fresh and on HOT Plates, I Seriously LOVED every bite and my daughter had The Biscuits and Gravy (see pics) and she cleaned her plate as well.   We sat outside and really enjoyed the patio, I'll have to go back to check out the inside on another Perfect Day!"}
{"text":"What is GOING on with the 3.5 stars here??  Tried more than once, seemed to get worse each time.  All the servers said \"Oohh, the Chinese food is GREAT!  So authentic, gotta try some!\"    We were skeptical (1) because of the name, duh!  and (2) because our first (AND SECOND) meal here was garbage!  Sadly, we didn't learn.    We reasoned that since the American food we ordered the days before had been so bad, perhaps the cooks are Chinese and know how to do that better?  WRONG!  Where's Panda Express when you need one, sheeze.  I'd rather fast dinner and head to the strip for a yummy breakfast in the morning :(   Oh, I get it now... most of the good reviews are for being CHEAP and OPEN LATE from apparent drunkards, nice."}
{"text":"I don't understand all these good reviews? This place is horrible. We didn't get ranch with our hot wings or soy sauce with our rice, and once the waiter left good luck catching him again! The food was completely inedible! I have nothing good to say about my experience and I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the 3rd time last night.  The meal was OK--not great, not terrible, but OK!  Service was OK, too, even a bit on the slow side.  I ordered the liver and onions and my wife had a ham and cheese sandwich.  Both were prepared well, the portion size was average, and the food was prepared well.  Our drinks were gotten fairly quickly and he came by to refill my iced tea when the glass was 1/2 full.  I probably would stop here when I was at the South Point again.  It is not a place I would go to just for the food and the experience."}
{"text":"been here twice now. had the breakfast here last year and it sucked. the corn beef and hash came from a can and was not fresh. Totally different experience this time for dinner. i had the porterhouse dinner and it came with a salad, dinner roll, and fries. In my opinion, it was more like a t bone steak but it was still good. im giving it an extra star because of the great service we received from two waitresses. will be back again for dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty darn pleased.   Very pleasant & prompt servers.   Poached eggs just right. Fruit was fresh & well cut.   And very reasonably priced.   Looking at other plates, bfast meats look very good.   No reason to not like this place, at least for bfast."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have lunch before heading back to California. On the hotels large electronic reader board there was a sign saying excellent Chinese food. Here's the bottom line the food looked fantastic and the portions were very generous but the sad part is that it all had zero flavor. You will see the pictures and it truly looks amazing but that's where it begins and ends. If the kitchen managers would only do a line check and taste everything before each meal I'm sure this would've never happened."}
{"text":"Is just a regular cafe, I guess the location makes this particular cafe better than similar cafes. I walked in from the pool and was happy to see that there was not a line. it might be the only place in the hotel without a line....  I intended to eat a healthy option but ended up getting a chocolate chip cookie. This always seems to happen for some reason which adds to the number of days I have to go jogging this week."}
{"text":"If I was Yelping 3 years ago, I'd be the Duke by a long shot.  When I first moved to Las Vegas in 2011, South Point was my home for the first couple of months.  So that meant a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinners at the Coronado Cafe.  Now that doesn't mean that the Coronado Cafe is a \"Must\" stop.  It just means that I was too lazy to leave the casino when the belly was calling.    So here's my review...  Service:  This really depends on the day, the time, and how busy they are.  I've gotten service as bad as 2 stars and as good as 5 stars.  Ironically, the service is actually better during the weekend nights when they are busy.  Busy here also means a lot more employees working, which means pretty good service. I found longer waits during the quiet morning/afternoons.   The Food:  There's something for everyone here. The menu is extensive and there's even Chinese Food.    My Suggestions:   -Eggs:  No one messes up eggs, Coronado doesn't either -Clam Chowder:  Pretty good stuff.  Not New England or Morro Bay good, but good enough that you'll be wanting more. -Porterhouse for $12.99:  Bang for your buck!  This is somewhat dry, so if you're use to a Medium-Well, get a Medium Plus.   -Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Surprisingly, not too bad.   -Asparagus:  Not on the menu, but they'll make it if you request it.  Good stuff! -Salmon:  I've had good and bad salmon here.  But I've had more good than bad.  Nothing really special.  Taste wise it's okay, protein wise it's worth it.  -Chicken Parmesan:  Just okay, but worth the try if you're in the mood.    Take my advice, avoid these: -Grilled Halibut Steak:  Flaky just how I like my fish, but it's too dry and really fishy.  -Prime Rib:  Taste like cardboard  -Any of their salads.  I've never had a fresh one here   Overall, I have to say that the food is just average at best.  However, Coronado fits everyone's budget.  The food is inexpensive and if you're in the casino, the restaurant is convenient.     YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (495/500)"}
{"text":"We came to South Point last night to take advantage of the late night special at this restaurant. Was not disappointed at all!   $4.95 for 7oz new york steak, eggs, toast, and hasbrown!  Service was fast and efficient. Will definitely come back again!   Late night special menu is between 12am and 6am!"}
{"text":"Worst Huevos Rancheros ever. Ordered eggs sunny side up and, believe it or not, they were SCRAMBLED. The tortillas were so tough, had to cut them with a knife. Sauce covering dish was awful. This wad not a dish made in any Mexican style I know of. I would eat here again just to try other menu items..but with real reservation"}
{"text":"The service here is descent and there is always someone there to refill your water. When I went there I had a Greek salad which was good and every morning I was able to get a nutritious breakfast.   I got the strawberry bowl, 2eggs and toast. My teammates got some oatmeal which they said was alright. However the hash browns were nasty to me. Tasteless and cheap."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I went alone one day while doing some house searching in downtown Phoenix. I just picked this place randomly not knowing it'd be so yummy! I ordered the salad with chicken, strawberries and panko-crusted goat cheese. It was SO delicious! I ate every bit of it. The chicken was so tender and moist...and sometimes grilled chicken can be quite dry. Not here. The portion size was more than enough for me and the service was great. It was a such a lovely day to boot. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I love casino coffee shops and I love late-night eats, but this place just annoys me. I'm a low-carb eater and it is like pulling teeth to get the kitchen to substitute a veggie or salad for their mounds of mashed potatoes. Really? I know starches are cheaper than some greens but come on! A restaurant ought to allow substitutions (even if the customer has to pay a little extra to get what they want). But nope. The food is fine, nothing outstanding but if you are hungry it'll do. The South Point's restaurants are not the star of the property. If you can, I'd try to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of ordering a bagel and lox. The lox was pure salt. Otherwise tasteless. The red onion was old.  Cannot recommend.  Overpriced too. Avoid."}
{"text":"What a great spot.  Just moved downtown a month ago and have been exploring new places to eat.  Just finished a brunch at Coronado cafe...  I had the southwestern omelette, and my fiancé had the crab cakes.  First of all the $3 bloody Mary's and mimosas are a steal, but that became an after note to the food!  The crab cakes are out of this world, huge chunks of meat and before I could ask for a second bite it was gone.  Luckily I had my own omelette that did not disappoint.  Cheesy, hatch chilies and really tasty potatoes on the side.  The service was good, and the owner was available and really matches the curbside appeal.  Great ambiance in a cool historic house.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"We had the Chinese food and it was the best I had in a long time server was on point and the place was clean and fast my buddy had the $3.99 steak and eggs and said it was great ...cab-drivers-specials\" menu available midnight to 6 Nothing over $4.00"}
{"text":"Off the strip a couple of minutes.  The steak & eggs are $3.99.   Beware! The service is absolutely horrible! I guess it's 3 am and all but waited nearly 30 minutes to get our order in and another 40 minutes to get our food.  You better be high off your ass for the steak and eggs to taste delicious. but come on it's 3.99  Don't go here sober....."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, tales were told of a great steak and eggs special for $3.95. The name of South Point was reverently proclaimed as the king of the late night specials. And all was good.  First time I ever made it out there was earlier this week. The steak and eggs special was $4.95 from midnight to 6am. But as people often become when they stay up late, we were hungry, And so we went.  The older gentlemen taking our orders was very efficient in going through the routine of asking how we wanted our steak cooked, our eggs done, and our bread choice... uh, chosen.  Anyway, I got a medium rare with scrambled eggs and wheat toast. The steak came out cooked about right, but that protein was pretty tough to chew. The eggs were pretty cool, and the toast was definitely nice with the jellies provided (strawberry, orange marmalade, grape). Hash browns tasted fine with ketchup but were otherwise a somewhat disappointing, mushy-below-the-surface concoction.  If I was here at the right time or night, I'd order it again. But it's not a destination of choice for uber-late dining."}
{"text":"There are so many choices of restaurants in the casino but we just wanted some comfort food so the cafe was the right choice.   We had an adorable young girl from Hawaii who served us drinks, but a waiter who was not at all attentive, more robotic.  I had a cup of chicken noodle soup and my husband had the French onion soup.  Mine was very good, lots of flavor and even lots of chicken, which is rare. The French onion soup had an nice dark broth and was also very good.  The bad thing was we had only eaten a few spoonfuls and they brought our entree.  That drives me crazy!   Totally a server issue, not the kitchen.    I had ordered the turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing.  My meal was hot and plentiful.  The real turkey was sliced very thin and the dressing was good.  The mashed potatoes had many big lumps of unmashed potatoes in them.   My husband had the pork special and it was enormous.  He said it was very tasty and his mashed potatoes were better than mine.   Sadly our room didn't have a refrigerator or we would have taken leftovers back to the room.     Overall, atmosphere was fine, service mediocre, and food decent."}
{"text":"After seeing the line for Steak N Shake we made a quick u-turn and listened to our tummies who told us to sit and eat anything-NOW!!! My parents love the Chinese food here and we were feeling a little sick so we decided to try a bowl of Wonton Soup, Egg Rolls, and a side salad. -Wonton Soup : I liked it-it wasn't the best or the worst- the broth-   thank goodness- had taste and the wontons were big. For the price though, I thought the bowl should've been bigger. I was surprised because most everything here is cheap but not the Chinese food!!! -Egg Rolls : I hate when places just cut the eggroll in two and then consider it 2 pieces when it's actually 1 damn piece, Gosh.... Anyways, they do this here- the taste was just like the soup-not the best or the worst... Side Salad : Typical They give you fried chow mein noodles with various dipping sauces for free.... **Warning** these fried chow mein noodles may chip your tooth-Hopfully, I just got a fried to long yucky order of it. Would I come back?   Not if I was paying, that's for sure..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everytime I come to the South Point I look forward for the $15 Porterhouse 16oz special. It also come with a soup/salad and a choice of a side!! Can't beat that!! Also the service is nice and comes at a reasonable speed. Definitely somewhere I come to everytime I visit the South Point."}
{"text":"Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.    Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative.   All in all, you really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hrs a day and it's cheaper than cheap when you're ordering from the \"taxi cab menu\" I think it's between the hours of midnight to 6am, something like that. You can get steak and eggs for like $4, of course they charge you $3.50 for OJ but they gotta make payroll somehow right? The service is very S-L-O-W so warning, but the food is decent, and I might try the Chinese menu next time, I heard a lot of good things about it."}
{"text":"You can't beat the value of $5 steak and eggs but it tastes exactly as it sounds... cheap steak, tacked along with two eggs and a pile of mushy hash browns. It was quite an eye opener in terms of value but taste wise, it's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Food was.....fod. 'NEVER coming back because of the uneasy feeling that they may have RE-USED a cut  english muffin for my Eggs Benedict. I feel I ATE SOMEONE ELSE'S THROW-AWAY. I explained to the Chef that an english muffin shouldn't be split especially when my other benedeict had a whole english muffin. Disgusting! The Chef kept saying that they dont do that and that he stands at the line and watches the cooks cook all day. Umm, poor use of labor and salary, I feel. I'm in the hospitality industry and that isn't how that job position works.  Server, Emilia was nice and the manager, Fran was empathic. I wouldn't be typing this if the Chef would just say he would talk with his crew or look into it even if he felt that it wasn't recycled english muffin. No thanks."}
{"text":"my absolute favorite part of vegas is the graveyard steak & egg deals, so imagine my disappointment when i went to vegas this past March (and hiked from CityCenter to Bill's and then Flamingo) to discover the deals were gone. :(  and thennnn my bf and i discovered Coronado Cafe at South Point. conveniently, we were staying at the hotel to recover from EDC before driving back to LA, so we hit up the late night deals.   we walked down to the cafe a little past midnight and waited about 15 minutes to be seated, but it was so worth it. i ordered steak & eggs ($3.95) and ham steak & eggs ($3.45). the bf ordered biscuits & gravy, the cheeseburger basket ($2.95) and steak & eggs. we ordered enough food for 4 people.   the food was amazing for its price. our steak was each 7 oz. and it looked so pretty, compared to the dinky and stiff steak i always had at Bill's. the hash browns actually looked fluffy and appetizing. The thick slice of ham was super savory and tender.. i liked it better than my steak. the gravy that accommodated the biscuits was seasoned really well and had small chunks of sausage in it.  the server was very attentive and super sweet. she came around frequently to check on us and even chatted with us for a bit despite how busy the cafe was.  our check was around $20 for enough food to last us at least two full meals. we're definitely down to make the 10 minute trip from the Strip for steak and eggs, given that at least one of us is semi-sober enough to transport us here."}
{"text":"Ordered: Steak & Eggs 12am-6am Special! (Graveyard Special)  Drunk, tired, or just hungry for \"Steggs\" (Steak and Eggs) this place is a go to if you're on this side of town. $4.99   ** MUST BE 21 or OLDER FOR THE SPECIAL**  It comes with hash browns and toast. The steak is 7 oz and its okay for the price you pay. When drunk it may be the perfect thing!   The wait is pretty long, so I suggest coming at 11:50pm to avoid the wait or coming at 2. Otherwise it will be a 15-30 min wait. We arrived at midnight and the wait was 15mins.   The server was patient with my party of 10 and I gave her a nice tip. Overall good place.   I got their ham as well and it was good."}
{"text":"There are only a few places in Vegas that offer steak and eggs and with that note, making them delicious!   Location: Coronado is located inside the South Point Hotel. Unfortunately it's off the strip which is about a 20 minute drive. This would be the only downside in getting this fine late night snack.  Food: I mean come on, 7 oz steak, eggs, hash browns, and choice of bread is more than enough for $4.95. They only offer this special from 12am-6am. The steak has ton of flavor and you can have the eggs made your way.   Staff: The line is long because most people are drunk or craving a midnight snack at this time. But it does come by pretty quick. The staff is nice and friendly. I haven't had a bad experience here yet. Right when you get seated, someone is there to take your drink order followed by the waiter/waitress.   Highly recommend this place for those who want some good steak and eggs!"}
{"text":"The cafe is a really comfortable place in a small converted house. I don't know Phoenix in the summer, but being there in the spring with the doors open it was a wonderfully airy and pleasant place to sit and eat. You'd never know there was a fairly busy street right outside.   The menu all looked great and the farm salad and chicken pesto sandwich was a great combination for a warm afternoon. I found them on my last day in Phoenix, and if you're in the area, especially visiting some of the near-by museums, the cafe is a great place to head for lunch.  Good food, friendly staff, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's not really much you can do with all those exquisite little bungalows that line 7th Street. You certainly couldn't live in them anymore, not with all that traffic whizzing by while you're trying to quaff your morning cup or grill up roast beast out back.   So, it's a good thing that somebody is converting them into cool little businesses! Like Coronado Cafe...  We've eaten here several times and not had a bad meal yet. [of course, we only go there for lunch but I can't imagine that dinner would be any different, but who am I to know? I just told off this little snot-nosed kid the other day that if his Granny swears that the sun comes up in the morning, verify it!!! like a good journalist would that is...]  But I digress: the food is fab, the ambience even more so [who wants to eat in a garage or a boring old steel box when you can have your lunch on an old sleeping porch??] and the cookies--ah, the cookies. Those delectable confections of chocolate-chipitude. OMG they're soooo good!!!  I'll have to go to dinner there so I can write another review and hold true to my journalistic principles."}
{"text":"$12.95 Prime Rib Special = Value.  Especially with the salad/potatoe of choice.  Occasionally you'll get a good waitress who will gladly change the Side Salad to Caesar Salad.  Those waitresses deserve an extra tip.  Graveyard Specials?  Learn to love them!  This place is the perfect example of South Point being a great value.  $3.95 for a NY Steak with Eggs/Toast/Hash Browns after midnight 7 days a week.    All the servers here are good, the food is excellent and the bar area is perfect for people like myself, who dislike waiting in line and skip right through......to eat and then run back to the poker room."}
{"text":"I spent 250$ gambling and we came to eat some food and it took 25 minutes for anyone to ask if we wanted to eat. We had to ask for a manger out of 5 people in order to even ask for food. This place is cheap at night but they charge 15$ for bacon and eggs during regular hours..: this place is ridiculous"}
{"text":"I went here recently with my mom for lunch. We had driven past it numerous times and finally bit the bullet and stopped.   It is a perfect spot for a downtown lunch. Cute, quaint, and quick service. Both my mother and I had the soup and 1/2 sandwich and while I wish there was more flavor in the soup, the sandwich was good and tasty. We topped off our lunch with a warm chocolate chip cookie- which was the highlight of my afternoon. If anything I will need to go back for a cookie, or two."}
{"text":"$3.95 for steak & eggs? $2.45 for a pancake sandwich? $1.45 for biscuits & gravy? Keep the EMTs on speed dial, because I'm about to eat my heart out.  Now, at these prices, the food won't blow your mind. It's good though; actually, better than I expected. Decent sized piece of meat cooked how I wanted (medium rare), eggs (over easy, and smothered in Tabasco), and toast. Other stuff is decent  too, if that's what you're in the mood for.   Keep in mind, the drunks come out at night for this. Strangely enough, I was completely sober at 3am.  I managed to have some drunk dudes randomly come up to my table for some nonsensical banter. I considered it table-side entertainment. The steak and eggs are keeping them happy, so I didn't mind. It was all in good fun.  Place is constantly packed, even at 3am. I'd expect a substantially longer line around the midnight hour."}
{"text":"Tried the steak and eggs at the early morning time, 5:30 am.  No crowd, great service and great food.  After reading several reviews, we were not sure what we would get....husband and I had the steak and eggs, our daughter had biscuits and gravy.  All were cooked as ordered. Great price for a great early morning meal."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointing!!!!  Had two of our 3 main dishes sent back because they were wrong. One they forgot the bacon in the omelette and the other was the New York steak ordered medium with pink inside and it came out over 2/3 well done. The vegetables were obviously previously frozen as they came out with what looked like freezer burn on them. YUCK!  The biscuit and gravy was so NOT worth it. The gravy was obviously from a can with no flavor what's so ever!  I tell you now I will not be back. I will take the little drive to Silverton for their menu."}
{"text":"We were coming from a long night out in Vegas and thought to try the famous steak and egg combo. The line at around 3a last Saturday was pretty crowded but the line moved rather quickly. The place was packed from people coming from the club etc. I ordered the steak and egg combo. Had the eggs sunny side up and hash browns. Whats funny is how the combo was $4.99 but a glass of soda was like $3.29 which was about the same as the combo itself but I guess thats how they make money on top. I ordered my steak medium well which was indeed cooked medium well but the steak was cold and bland. The eggs were cooked but didnt seem like freshly cooked. The only thing warm was the hash browns which was ok at best. Maybe if they cooked them all fresh to order then My opinion might have changed."}
{"text":"Drinking at the bowling alley at the Southpoint on a Sunday night. The four of us were drunk and wanted breakfast, so we went to the Coronado Cafe.   Nothing much to say.  It wasn't the greatest breakfast, but it wasn't bad either.  You can't beat a $3.99 steak and eggs special.  It satisfied our breakfast craving."}
{"text":"This could possibly be my favorite place to eat from now on! Great service, great food and just an all around cute restaurant! Our great experience started from the second we turned onto the property. A friendly man told us were to park. We entered and were greeted by a smile. We were seated quickly. We let JR, our fantastic server, know that we were on our way to a show and were limited on time. He then made suggestions as to what entrees would be best. I ordered the crab cakes, which are by far the best I have ever had in the valley! They were all crab and no filler. I laughed at my husband for ordering the meatloaf, although JR said that it is really good. To my surprise, that even came out looking and smelling fantastic. My husband truly enjoyed every single bite.  It's far too often that one spends too much money on a dinning experience that's not enjoyed. Coronado Cafe far exceeds many of the most expensive restaurants in the Phoenix area in service, flavor and charm and I can't wait to go back. This is what a restaurant should be."}
{"text":"The place is really nice, my tenderloin was small but really good.  I liked it, you would to (if you like really nice kinda fancy places)...   But I don't know ... I guess it's the kind of place that married men take their girlfriends.  Or the place you take your wife (the one you still like) the day after her Mom died.  Or in my case ... if you just want to feel like the second youngest person in the room (my date Jacqui J won first place, hands down).  Nothing is wrong with this place, it's just ... well it's not bar food and there was no jukebox with Johnny Cash in it.  Not only that, when I asked for a can of Blatz they looked at my like I was an alien.  And not a spork in the house!  And get this, they took cloth and made it into napkins!  Weird stuff!  But seriously  ... the place is cozy (almost to much) ... the food is in small portions (at least mine was) and kinda pricy.  It was just what I expected.  No more, no less.  A solid 4 no doubt.  And any restaurant that tries to make a go of it on 7th Freeway/Street ... God Bless 'em!"}
{"text":"I realize I am going to probably destroy my credibility with this review, but I have to be truthful.....this place has the best Shrimp and Lobster Sauce, and Egg Foo Young, in Vegas (and I have eaten in many Chinese resturuants in Vegas, including Chinatown, on the Strip, and local places throughout Vegas and Henderson. I also lived 35 years in the NYC/NJ area, and spent a month in China, so I know what good Chinese food tastes like). The Wor Wonton soup is also excellent. As far as the non-Chinese items on the menu (prime rib, eggs, burgers, sandwiches, etc...), all of these items are typical quality of what you would find at any Vegas cafe....nothing great, but decent at a fair price. But my advice would be to just stick with the Chinese food."}
{"text":"Our rodeo group of six having lunch here now. All is well. Nice larger portions. Beth and I shared a Chinese dish. Others all had variety. Everyone said was all good in size and taste. No dissappointments here from anyone our group."}
{"text":"skip the $15 prime rib special.  go for breakfast - they do that well.  Not a generous portion of any meal - the flavoring is middle of the road.  prime rib was cooked to order, but about 15% was fatty and gristle.  one ice cream sized scoop mashed potato, salad was \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I come to this place almost every Monday for their unique Chef Special (off menu).  So far I have not been disappointed.  BTW, who can say no to Coronado Cafe's Chicken Chowder Soup?  And make sure you leave some room for dessert.  if you're on a diet then please disregard this last note.  :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Just plain horrible. Ordered kung pau chicken, got cashew. At room temperature, which means in a casino it was ice cold in 5 minutes. The egg roll was so over cooked I swear it was trice fried. I couldn't eat it because it was not only Well Done, but so cold it was like it was cooked a week ago. Maybe it was. The Chicken Fried Steak my mother ordered was just as bad. Cold and tough. The eggs and hashbrowns were ok but the one teaspoon of gravy they put on it had to have from the fridge.  Oh well the water was cold and refreshing."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the place to hit up after late night rendezvous at the club.  You can get a whole meal for less than $5.00 and that's including tip.  The service is kind of crappy, but hey with a meal that's less than $5.00 what kind of service do you expect right?   They have a list of the graveyard menus on the table, forget looking at the menu go straight for this.  It ranges from steak and eggs to burgers and biscuits with gravy.  I personally love their burger, I mean it isn't amazing or anything.  It just satisfies the stomach after a late night facade."}
{"text":"BEST VALUE LATE NIGHT FOOD SPECIALS IN LAS VEGAS!  The Coronado cafe (inside the SouthPointe Casino) may be a few miles South of the Strip, but it's a good place for late-night eats.  Their $3.95 steak and eggs special (including hash brown and toast) features a made-to-order steak that actually is of a decent quality!  They also have other specials, all under $4.00, that are equally tasty.  I was impressed by their service, too.  Coffees and waters were filled before we had to ask and the servers couldn't be more pleasant and helpful.  The Coronado Cafe is in a cavernous area with high ceilings, so it is huge and can be filled even at 2 am!  When we were there, I was talking to a friend so much that my food went cold.  When I asked a server to please zap it in a microwave, she returned with ALL NEW FOOD!  What a pleasant surprise.  I'd recommend the Coronado Cafe to anyone who's looking for a great late-night value.  Unfortunately, the only complaints I would have are that 1) the place is so large it can be quite noisy and 2) their late-night specials menu could include a flat pancake & egg dish.  Currently, all they offer is a pancake sandwich similar to a McGriddle."}
{"text":"Usually I like every meal here. Great breakfasts, sandwiches and even the Chinese food is great. However my brother who is a truckdriver was finally able to stop in Vegas for a couple hours. We don't see each other very often. He wanted a nice steak dinner. Since the truck stop is close by, we decided to try their $14.95 porterhouse steak and prime rib. My prime rib was so tough I couldn't chew it, the baked potato was obviously nuked and had been sitting around awhile. My brothers steak was also tough. The only thing that was edible was the salad. I was embarrassed, especially since he insisted on paying the bill for 5 people who also ordered the special. I will go back,but will order a sandwich or Chinese. Very disappointed.."}
{"text":"Prices were very cheap for the late night specials. However, service was terrible. Lucky for them, they already include gratuity in large parties; otherwise, I would have left a mediocre tip."}
{"text":"Being from Baltimore, Maryland, I couldn't help but notice a sign out front of Coronado Cafe claiming host to \"Phoenix's best crab cakes\"... I was quite skeptical at first... mainly due to the fact that my experience with crab cakes in Phoenix has involved too much filler and low quality crab meat. But after reading some pretty good reviews on Yelp, I knew I just had to find out for myself! After biting the bullet on the $24 price tag for the crab cake dinner I was presented with a plate of pure heaven on earth. Two 2oz crab cakes made from 100% JUMBO lump Maryland Blue Crab drizzled lightly in a homemade remoullade, with a side of potatos and asparagus! Theses crab cakes are the real deal! Rumor is that the chef or owner or somebody there is actually from Maryland, and it shows! PEOPLE OF PHOENIX: THIS IS WHAT A CRAB CAKE SHOULD TASTE LIKE!!!"}
{"text":"Only went here cause I had to. Here for a basketball tournament. Food was just ok. Really disappointing. Server was nice but if the food isn't good and the service is slow... woah. Not good. Can't even write anything else. I didn't think you could have French toast that tasted like dry old bread. With syrup on top. Truly yucky. Hated the fact that I was starving because I was too hungry to go stand in line somewhere else. Never again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day with my team and the food was great! We started with the super lump Maryland style blue crab cakes and they were unbelievable. Then I had the roast chicken sandwich with provolone cheese, bacon and hatch green chiles. It came with a side of macaroni and cheese that was absolutely delicious with bread crumbs on it that gave it an amazing texture. Our server Emily was so nice and it was great to meet the owner Dianne. They are also doing brunch on the weekends. I cant wait to try it!"}
{"text":"Went here to try the \"great Chinese food.\"  The hot and sour soup was so off in flavor. It was horrible.   The main dish I had was excellent unfortunately I got food poisoning from it and was violently ill almost immediately.  I also do not understand why none of the restaurants in this hotel do take out. Ridiculous. There are no TVs in the restaurants so sometimes you might like to take your food to the room."}
{"text":"Food was very good cafe food in a comfortable setting.  Service was decent, prices were fair.  Solid 3 1/2"}
{"text":"We ate a breakfast and dinner here while staying at the South Pointe Resort.  The food is okay and the service is the same--just okay.  At breakfast, the hash browns were under cooked and tasteless.  At dinner, I wasn't able to substitute a small salad for fries.  I would have gladly paid extra, but it just wasn't allowed.  I'd eat here again, but only if there were no other choices."}
{"text":"Dined here twice during my stay in Vegas. The first time I got Chinese food. Not sure what I was thinking when I saw a Chinese food menu in an American menu. Got the Mongolian beef and the scallop and shrimps. First few bites were really delicious then I couldn't figure out what happened but everything was not enjoyable after. Hours later after my meal, I had concluded that the rice was too dry. Ever try eating dry rice? Let me know how you like it.   Came back again for the graveyard specials. Long line. Not worth the wait. Got the $5 steak and eggs and $4 cheese burger. First the water server dropped a plate in lemons in the table with our waters and I immediately pointed in hair on the lemons. He didn't seem to care of bothered to say sorry. Just picked up the plate and walked away.   The steak and eggs. Gross. Steak was overlooked and dry. Told my friend it felt like I was eating a dry sponge. No flavor. Nothing exciting.   The burger. Again. Gross. Tasted like cardboard. Not even ketchup helped. Fries that came with my burger were cold and mushy.   I guess this is what you get for vegas dining experience. Just don't go here. Save yourselves."}
{"text":"had the porterhouse steak 12.99 special dinner steak was tough, very gristly, not a steak I would want to eat in public because I kept having to pull half eaten bits of gristle out of my mouth and place on plate  not worth it"}
{"text":"Steady decline in food quality. Service not as good as it once was, place is dirty. They seem very disorganized All the time. Cheap late nite food specials. You get what you pay for. Too dirty, lousy food, bad service, sloppy dirty place. Bye bye. Not for us any longer. Great location, they cheapen A Nice Casino."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there last night, and I've been there for brunch before as well. It's down the street from my house, so I WANT it to be good because it's so cute and cozy, but I've never had anything I've actually liked there.  I got the burger, which was decent, but it had this kind of garlic cheese spread on it, and when you're eating it on porous ciabatta bread, it has a tendency to leak out the holes in the bread all over your hands. My boyfriend got one of the pizzas, which was burnt on the edges like it had been cooked too long. We also weren't filled with confidence when 100% of the time we've passed by, the cook has been outside on his phone smoking a cigarette. Maybe my boyfriend's food was overcooked because he had to take a very important call.  When I went for brunch, I had the crab eggs benedict, and it was pretty flavorless. For what I'm paying there, I'd like to actually enjoy my food, but I was so underwhelmed, and since it's always been dead in there and it's got wood floors, everything you say echoes, which can be awkward.  One more thing: when you look at the menu online, the \"lunch and dinner menu\" is the lunch menu. The entrees and the prices change when you actually eat dinner there. I would have saved money and been better fed by going next door to America's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"My rating is for the great deal only. It's hard to shine with regular breakfast items, but Coronado does it with the low prices. You know a place is doing something right when it is packed and you have to wait for a table at 3am.   From midnight to 6 am, Coronado Cafe has graveyard specials that include $2.45 for 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon or sausage. They also have 7 oz NY steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast for $3.95!!!  Need I say more? If I wasn't still full from dinner and thinking about crawling into bed soon after eating, I would've gone for the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a later-in-the night dinner -- not quite \"late night\" (when the meals are so cheap, it's crazy!)  I had breakfast -- everything, including my over hard eggs, was cooked perfectly.  My hubby had a burger and loved it.  Service was quick and friendly.  Good little break place in the casino!"}
{"text":"I only come here when everyone comes here for the most obvious reason ;)  I walk in around 11:50ish and there's hella fobby filipinos waiting outside of the cafe. I turn red 'cause I'm like, it HAD to be the FOB Filipinos waiting here for the midnight specials. They WOULD come here at this time! Haha.   Right when it turns midnight, they get in line. My titas and titos are all staring at me and my friend like they got shit on us. Dang! Just drop it already! We don't know each other.  Pero anyways, the Steak and Eggs were good; if you order it Medium Rare or Well Done, it doesn't seem to matter, they look and taste the same! Slightly red inside but delicious nonetheless. I can't say the same for the burgers! They were bland and were not marinated but you can't complain 'cause it's dirt-cheap and it's during graveyard hours. Graveyard-hours food tends to taste bad anyway unless you're FADED.   Service here is good too. A good, affordable place to take your tourist friends/family after a night of drinking since it's closer to the strip but I prefer the Sourdough Cafes in both of the Arizona Charlie's locations."}
{"text":"The WORST food I've ever had in my entire life. We were a group of 9 and everything was undercooked and old. DISGUSTING !!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this place opens 24/7, but they certainly opens SUPER LATE. We ate here after bowling tournament ends around 11.30ish and they have Special price for some items on the menu if ordered between midnight and 6am, about 7 items or so for $5 or less, including steak and eggs.  They also offer chinese foods between 11pm and 5am, it's so weird, but hey all I care is for the deals, especially when I'm already tired and just wanted to eat something before going to sleep.  Service was sub par, but food was pretty decent and I actually liked their wonton noodles. The only thing I don't like was the price for that noodles, almost $15, yikes! But otherwise, anything on the menu were enough to make me satisfied."}
{"text":"Been eating here for so many years, today i went by myself and ordered some chinese food, but this server told me that they cannot do to go orders???? Wtf im eating for dine in and didnt ask for a to go orders! What if i have left overs? There not gonna take it for to go? Am i wasting my money here??? Im very dissapointed !!!"}
{"text":"The food is average. I liked the service.  The ham and cheese omelet I got for breakfast is maybe a little better than an average Denny's. It doesn't seem to be made with especially fresh ingredients or skill. The service was friendly and that helped."}
{"text":"My husband and son went there today for the first time.  My son bit into his shrimp and felt a chunk of metal get lodged in his tooth.  He dug around in his mouth trying to dislodge it.  It finally came out......it was an earring back that had gotten stuck between two of his molars.  My son stood up and brought the earring back to an older, white-haired guy that looked like he was in charge and/or the owner.  They guy took the offending piece from my son and said something like, \"I'll go talk to the kitchen.....\".  He never returned......no explanation, no apology, no comp-ing anything, nothing -- totalled ignored my husband and son.  EPIC FAIL!"}
{"text":"If you come during the day it will expensive to eat.  To get the great deal, you must be an all night person.  Starting at 12am to 6am you can get a fantastic steak and egg breakfast for only $3.95.  You would think the food would not be up to par, but for this situation you would be wrong.   I would recommend this for the truckers going through Vegas.  There is a parking lot just for 18 wheelers, that is well lit.  Park your truck walk across the street, and enjoy a well deserved breakfast.  The exit number is 31."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING AND BAD SERVICE   We arrived at 11:45pm in time for the late night special at midnight. We asked to be seated and enjoy our drinks until it was time for the midnight special (15 min) and they said no. Come back at 12:00am. Who knew their was a time limit sitting at a table?   Secondly, why do you have to be 21 to order eggs and hash browns at 12:00am? Ridiculous!   Here is where it gets BAD. Finally when I got home, I noticed I had slight stomach pain. Not worried at all, I go to sleep. I've been up since 2:30am with excruciating stomach cramps. Currently at 5:30am I am violently ill.   Never again."}
{"text":"Heard the Chinese food here was some of the best in town so decided to give it a try for lunch. Glad we did because it was excellent! Tasted like actual authentic Chinese food and not that Panda Express crap. Only thing is it was a bit expensive. $13.95 for a lunch portion little ridiculous but it is what it is. Last next to us had the won ton and it looked amazing! Have to order that next time."}
{"text":"Average for Vegas. No signature dishes or flare in cooking. Just a regular dinner. I can make better food at home. If u charge money then u should provide better food. Vegas just charges more for what you get back home."}
{"text":"For late night munchies if I'm ending my night at South-point, if that is where I'm hanging out, for none other than the raved reviews for.....drum roll....Breakfast deals!    Just giving it 3 stars because the service is mediocre, sometimes you have to stand up and get help, don't forget you are still near the casino where you could possibly still inhale the smoke, and if you are like me, come here for their graveyard specials, expect a long line.    Its been a while since I've had the late night munchies, and they have really expanded on their menu, so that's a plus.  I had a Short Rib Omelette, and it was nothing spectacular, so next time, I will stay with the breakfast deals.  I always try to order something new to taste, but I think for this particular cafe, I'll stick with the breakfast."}
{"text":"My new favorite!   My husband and I had a wonderful dinner last night at CC. Our waiter was David and he was great. He was professional, funny, and attentive but not overly so. We started our meal with the crab cakes which were amazing. Real chunks of crab and not a lot of breading. I ordered a margarita which was well mixed. I ordered the special and my husband had the scallops. The risotto was amazing!  I liked that the owner was waiting at the front door and seating people as they entered. It gave the resaurant a family feel. We will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the midnight special for steak and eggs.   Popular place.  Great service.   Good food for the price is midnight specials.  Portions of food was just the right amount.   They check ID too."}
{"text":"Steak & Eggs for $3.95 from midnight to 6am? Who would say no to this?!  Lines can be long, but it moves extremely quickly as the cafe is really spacious. Food comes out at a decent speed and the quality is actually better than what you would expect for only 3.95! You get steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, AND toast.  I would recommend going \"one down\" on your steak preference (ie if you like medium, go medium rare) because they crank them out and usually aren't the best at keeping track of all the temperatures. But other than that, it's a solid steak. Hash browns are crisp on the outside and a little soft in the middle. Eggs are cooked nicely and the toast comes buttered for you. Besides the steak/eggs, if you're extra hungry - the biscuits and gravy are a great pick to share. Decent biscuits and the gravy packs a good amount of flavor.   Overall, really solid place to eat at when you've had some adult beverages and need something cheap and (somewhat) fast to eat. This is one of those rare occasions where the quality is actually better than what you pay for."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with steak and eggs under $5.00. Steak, eggs, hash browns and toast is a great way to end the night. I love my hash browns extra crispy. Service is speedy, the secrets out some nights you might have to wait."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, delicious and the service is fast and attentive. Love the dining ambiance."}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe had been on our list for a long time and we were finally able to put a big exceptional check mark next to it!  We were meandering down 7th St. trying to decide where we should eat. When the Coronado Cafe sign was with in sight, it truly was \"SIGN\" to eat there.  What a great place to have a meal!  Everyone mentioned how intimate and cozy the inside of this restaurant was and they were correct.  The wait staff was also perfectly attentive.  We ordered a margarita and sangria.  Jeannie loved her sangria and my margarita (just the plain house version) was very tasty.    We agreed that we wanted to share a few small dishes.  The crab cakes and scallops proved to be a super tasty start.  We highly recommend both!  Each of us ordered a Greek salad.  It was a little too tart for me, but Jeannie enjoyed hers and helped me with mine.  Finished off our shared meal with the special of the day.  It was halibut with a parsnip puree and steamed veggies.  The fish tasted very fresh and the parsnip puree was enjoyed more by me than the lovely wife.    Everything we ordered was a reflection of the cafe itself...delicately seasoned, prepared, and presented. Getting to enjoy carefully prepared food and drinks while in a perfectly simple setting was time well spent.  Coronado Cafe is a must try for everyone. Enjoy it with your sweetheart or a great friend (more than 4 people to your group would seem too much...at least to us!)  I wouldn't recommend taking small kids."}
{"text":"The food here has let me down for the last time. Steak was so tuff I got a burger instead. Very mediocre at best when I exchanged. The servers are always nice though."}
{"text":"We stayed in the South Point for a week so I sadly got to frequent this \"Cafe\".   The food is marginal most of the time. Every now and then it drops to \"Crappy\" but if you know this going into things then you're ready for it. We were there as a big group for the week and the general consensus was the same as mine for the entire group. I had the chicken fried steak.. the hash and eggs and some sort of omelet over the course of the week and it was all just ehh.  I finished my breakfast every time but one.. the omelet was just plain not good and I left half of it and forced everyone to pause while I stooped on our way to our event to \"Speak into the Clown\" at a local drive-thru.   The service was friendly every time but once.. (I'll get to that in a minute) but is HORRIBLY slow... painfully, agonizingly, annoyingly slow..  I can guarantee you two things.. 1.) You WILL wait forever. Not so much for your food as it comes fairly quickly but for the server to do anything.  2.) Your beverage WILL go empty and sit there for a while like that.   Recommendations for the Coronado cafe??  1.) Go someplace else if you can.  2.) Budget LOTS of time.  3.) If dining alone... bring a book or something."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way from the early days of the \"South Coast\" hotel and casino. Back then, after being only open a few weeks, I experienced terrible customer service and mediocre food.  Last night, my cousins and I wanted some late night steak and eggs, so we picked the South Point. I was surprised at the quality of food. The cut of New York steak was visibly better than some others I've had lately. It wasn't the most tender on the inside, but still good. In any case, it's easily one of the better steak and egg graveyard specials in town. My cousins also seemed to enjoy the items they ordered. In particular, they were impressed by the vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Good cheap eats late at night.Also great Chinese food at this place and kind of expensive though.They have great dinner specials reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I had the late night (12-6 am) eggs and bacon special which is a really great deal at $2.95 especially if you skip the coffee.  I did have the coffee and didn't think it was good at all for the price.  Tasted like weak diner coffee which is fine but not for $3.5  Fast service and everything cooked as expected.  The bacon was good quality."}
{"text":"10 stars for sure! This place has delicious steaks, eggs, hamburgers, etc! The service is always beyond extremely friendly and the food tastes like it was made by an angel! This place NEVER disappoints!!"}
{"text":"I got the tuna sandwich on a baguette with mac and cheese on the side. The tuna was like a fancy tuna salad with herbs mixed in. The mac and cheese had yummy \"crumbles\". The atmosphere was cute and quaint, and the wait staff were very attentive, and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"I really love crab cakes and have been dying to find a place to meet my standards. My best friend and I have now been here twice. Every time it gets better! This place serious does have the best crab cakes in Phoenix! I also recommend trying the smoked salmon appetizer! DELICIOUS! This place is also very cute! It's like an old house transformed into a restaurant. I love it. It's a bit pricey for appetizer but I feel that it is worth it!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is pretty good. One day I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was very juicy and not heavily breaded. The next morning I ordered the eggs Benedict the eggs were perfectly cooked as well as the hash browns that came with it. My waiter was pleasant both times and they constantly refill your drinks. FYI after 12am the lines are ridiculous since it is the only late night dinning option at south point."}
{"text":"I've never been here for anything other than the graveyard specials. It'll probably stay that way. Ultimately, South Point hates customers like me. They want to lure me into the casino with their loss leader graveyard specials, which then leads to me throwing away money on the craps table. Joke's on you South Point. I'll go to your casino, eat your medium rare steak, wheat toast, hash browns, and over easy eggs, then head straight home. Sure I've had better steak, but I can't complain at $4.95 plus tax for the whole meal. At that price, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Food is average, not great but gets the job done. For the quality though, the Chinese food is definitely somewhat overpriced. I had the General Tso's chicken lunch special which was $13 or so which came with fried rice and an egg roll. It was fine but a little too heavy for me."}
{"text":"Pretty historic house turned into a restaurant. Love it!   I think the atmosphere is pretty fancy and great for a date night. The food is high-quality too. I had a chocolate chip cookie for dessert last time. It was warm and the chocolate chips were gooey. Yum..."}
{"text":"Once again, a lunch that was too large resulted in us grabbing a bite to eat at this restaurant later that evening. This time my wife and I chose the French onion soup which again was very good and salt lite.  I also ordered a side salad that was primarily Romaine lettuce with a bottled dressing."}
{"text":"Two words: Service sucks!  It took us 20 minutes to order our food. Once we tried to ask the waiter that we were ready she said she was busy,  Do not go here.  Food was ok. The only thing I think intrigued me was the $3.99 steak and eggs for late night."}
{"text":"We stopped here from California on our way to Flagstaff based on recommendation from a friend.  Eating outside on the Patio was a nice especially since it was such a beautiful day :)  Sadly, this place would have gotten a 4 stars from me if it wasn't for my sister's Tuna Salad (rotten tomatoes and cucumbers with unwashed wilted lettuce) so sent back and she lost her appetite :(  However, my Crabby Benedict, hubby's Blue Burger were delicious and highly recommended!!!  My brother in law had the Veggie Scramble which looked simple but he did enjoy the multigrain toast that came with it."}
{"text":"24 hour spot inside the South Point Casino.  We ordered off the Chinese Food menu and BIG mistake!  The food was edible but did not taste that great.  Majority of the items were overly salty.  We had the Black Pepper Chicken (hint of curry which was good), Mongolian Beef (but not with the traditional green onions had bell pepper instead?), Chicken Fried Rice, and Firecracker Chicken.  Next time if I have to eat here will stick to the basic club sandwich or something.    Also, they do have a late night breakfast specials from 12 am to 6 am which I didn't try but they items for under $3 and you can't beat that when you are up late gambling :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Been a gambler and overall frequent customer of South Point for years. I sat at the bar tonight waiting 20 minutes for my short order South Point special and when it came completely wrong, I had to speak out. This is not the first time this has happened and when I expressed my concern to the a \"manager\" Ruben, who told me I couldn't get a comp meal but instead I'd have to wait another 20 minutes in a rather vague hope that I would get my meal right, I asked for a real manager to speak with. He ran off and called security on me. As an aside, he had such bad breath that I had to recoil while he was talking. This is an example of how not to treat repeat customers and actual locals who usually come back. I spend a ton at South Point and I would never expect to be treated with such obvious disdain as I have been in many recent attempts at eating happily and peacefully in your cafe. Your overnight management could be easily construed as cowardly and ineffectual. Your business is terrible and all in hopes of getting substandard food at an elevated price. Never again."}
{"text":"The porterhouse steak was pretty good for the $12.99 price.  It came with a salad and baked potato. I think the food here is much better than the Garden Buffet in the South Point.  And the coffee is better too."}
{"text":"Food is meh! Not what I expected when I asked for EXTRA sausage , I have more potato's then ever , my friend had the \"build your own burger.\" And asked for side bacon & the server rang ONE piece ! Wtf is that .   Took at least 15-20 minutes just to get a refill. The only thing that's good that we ordered was the pancakes. Yaaaay ! But for breakfast dinner I asked for more sausage NOT potatoes!"}
{"text":"Having had numerous favorable experiences at Coronado Cafe in the past, we were deeply disappointed at our most recent, and regrettably probably our last visit.  The evening was off to a great start with the predictably excellent crab cakes.  While the driver scallops were equally delicious, the chimichurri-style rib-eye was barely edible.  Despite being cooked properly - medium rare - the meat had a strange after taste.  After struggling with the steak - and subsisting on two shared scallops in exchange for some steak  - not an even trade by ANY measure - we told our waiter of the disappointment, at which point he spirited away the plate.  Since I was soon to be finished with the scallops (having shared half with my dining partner with the barely edible steak).  The waiter provided some explanation behind the problem with the steak when he advised that the chimichurri included vinegar and lime - two odd ingredients for a rib-eye, which accounted for the bitter after taste.  The response of Coronado to apparently weigh the returned entree to determine the \"discount\"  was an insult as it suggested that we should have either been forced to eat alone (i.e., return the steak after the first bite) rather than enjoy our meal together.  Had they tasted the meat rather than focused on the weight perhaps they would have realized how unpleasant the meal was.  As we have ample other dining options available to us on our \"short\" list, we will not be returning anytime soon to Coronado Bill and Bob Phoenix"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby had to try this place since the steakhouse didnt have a table for like 3hrs. He had pasta and I had a steak with mashed potatoes. Both of the meals took forever to get out  and my toddler was on the verge of a meltdown so when it did arrive we tried to eat fast. Good thing we were not starving cuz the food was not great. I almost wish Southpoint would stop giving us free rooms so we dont have to eat at the restaurants it has."}
{"text":"I love the Chinese food menu at the Coronado Cafe....  Last night I enjoyed the neptune's nest dish: a veritable cornucopia filled with shrimp, scallops, crab claws, squid, and fish. Spooned over rice, it is a show-stopper.   Even better was my dining companion's salt and pepper sea bass. This is seafood perfection on a plate.   Don't be afraid....  Order from the Chinese menu at the South Point!"}
{"text":"Perfectly complimenting their slightly funky, slightly hip 'historic' Phoenix neighborhood, Coronado Cafe is the place to go for comfort food with a modern twist, with an easy laid back ambiance.  Coronado's quaintness offers comfort like a proverbial pair of old slippers.  The service here is always spot on, even during the busy lunch rush.  I am impressed that each service experience at Coronado is a friendly smiling face.  I always leave feeling that not only are the coolest Phoenicians (diverse, individualistic, interesting, intelligent, versus Scottsdale snobbisms) at Coronado, the wait staff is a reflection, or vice versa, of the clients.  I tend to often go back to the meatloaf.  I would offer that although perhaps a tad on the salty side, a wonderful, flavorful staple, presented on top of perfectly prepared smashed potatoes.   Who said there is not heaven on earth?"}
{"text":"On the plus side the ambiance is very cozy, in a cottage with rotating artwork, and the service is extremely friendly. There is a dirt parking lot that contributes to the warm, homely feel of the place.  Unfortunately, the food doesn't make its marks. I ordered a porterhouse steak - the trouble started when I wasn't even asked how I wanted it done (it appears to have come medium-well). The steak wasn't lean (very tough in places) and while the sauce it was served with was interesting in the first bites, it wasn't well-balanced and failed to impress the further one got into the meal.   The side of asparagus was al-right, albeit lacked a satisfying crunch, though the potatoes were too starchy to be served alone without a savoury compliment (sauce would have accomplished this if it weren't as sweet as it was).  Yet the crime was in the crème brulee; the custard was cakey. If I had tipped the dish it would not have flowed. That is not how this dessert, one of my personal favourites, is meant to be."}
{"text":"We always drive down to Coronado Cafe every time we visit Vegas. This visit was always like the past visits. The service was excellent and the food was fast and hot. If you have never been here please do. We have had Phillip G as our server the last two times and he always greats you with a smile.  Tom"}
{"text":"I went to eat at the coffee shop with my husband, as we do multiple times a month. I have been eating the Chinese food at the coffee shop for years and have never had a problem. I asked my server (who had been extremely rude from the get go) if the spring rolls have any shrimp in them. He asked if I was allergic. I said no, but shrimp makes me queasy. We waited for 15 minutes. Nothing. Next, the female manager of the restaurant approached my husband and I said she could not serve us due to my allergy. I repeated that I do not have an allergy and that I eat here frequently. She said that it did not matter as the chefs do not clean the woks and utensils. Now, I understand not wanting to have an liabilty on your hands, however, she was extremely rude and didn't even offer for us to order something different. I am so upset I didn't get her name (heavy set lady with shorter dirty blonde hair). Instead just repeated that she could not serve us. When I asked to speak to someone above her, she refused. My family and I spend thousands of dollars at the south point every month (my mother is Pamela Chojnowski). I guess I will take my business to the M where they appreciate locals and don't kick them out and embarrass them."}
{"text":"I ordered the Prime Rib during lunch with friends. The salad that came first was nice and cool and crisp, the blue cheese dressing was a bit different than im used to but was still good. Onto the Meat! It was cooked perfectly for me as ordered, medium rare. The horseradish was the creamed style but still had a little kick to it and I ate every bite. The baked potato was still a bit hard so I didn't really eat most of it, but I didn't have much room for it anyway after the salad and Prime! For $14.00 this was a great meal! See you next year."}
{"text":"Food here is decent. We come here once a week. Lots of specials. Usually quiet during the week with good service."}
{"text":"My low expectations where not met. Even the kids Mac and cheese was gross. Very runny and bad taste."}
{"text":"Lite lunch with the ladies.  Two of us shared Crab Cakes and Caprese salad.  I could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating Steggs (Steak & Eggs) here last night. I was pretty excited to try it, because all of my friends have been talking about the $5 Steggs deal after midnight. The food was not so great. You get one piece of steak, eggs of your choice, hashbrowns, and your choice of toast. My steak was a pretty decent size, however, it was so hard to cut (they didn't have any more steak knives) and to eat. I asked for a medium-rare steak but they gave me a rare steak, which I wasn't too happy with. It also had no seasoning what so ever. The hashbrowns tasted like clay and my eggs were very watery and I'm pretty sure they were still somewhat raw (I got them scrambled). The sourdough bread was alright. Our waiter was very patient with us, but the lady up front who is in charge of checks was super rude and very unpleasant. But it was $5 for steak, eggs, hashbrowns and bread. I wasn't expecting a super great meal, but honestly it could of been much, much better. Also, now they changed the policy, and you have to be 21 to order steggs, which is complete bs. They are going to lose a lot of business from teens and young adults."}
{"text":"CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! Their cab driver special, after 12am, is perfect for the gamblers and party goers. The food is inexpensive and the service is lacking. The quality of the food on special is below par. I ordered a burger recently, medium well, and it was over cooked. It tasted like newspaper. Sure I had just come back from the Strip and was exhausted and I ate it all, but it doesn't excuse the over cooked patty. my brothers biscuits and gravy were cold. There is usually a long wait in line to be seated. I do enjoy their Chinese food, orange chicken is pretty decent. Its family style and we can all share. I will continue to go to Coronado Cafe since its cheap and opened late."}
{"text":"$3.75....steak and eggs...can't beat that from midnight -0600"}
{"text":"My Wife and I came here with three friends about an hour after the Super Bowl. We had a 12 minute wait, which is really good for such a busy night. The food we ordered was extremely tasteful and well prepared. We tried our best to be sociable w/ our waitress but she was strictly business and not too personable. Besides that we had a wonderful time. I recommend coming to this restaurant for the \"graveyard special\" when it's a lot less traffic/people."}
{"text":"FIRST AND LAST TIME at this place! I was there for coffee while my wife and her sister played bingo. Sat there with an empty cup for over an hour and was never offered a 2nd cup or a refill on my water. Oh, and the price? How about $3.51 for a cup of coffee!!! No thanks. Would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ate here twice and service was pretty sub par both times, but you know, you kinda get what you pay for, I guess.  The better deals were after midnight, where you could get a burger or steak and eggs for like $3 or $4, which was helpful on the wallet after losing cash at the casino.  They have all of the typical cafe type foods and another menu dedicated to Chinese food, which was actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"Good food great prices, between 12am and 6am. Menu isn't extensive it's all under priced. Way better than the overpriced buffet in the same hotel."}
{"text":"We actually found this place by accident. Their $3 mimosa & bloody mary sign lured us in, and I'm glad it did. We almost turned around when we noticed that we were the only car in the parking lot, we have learned in the past that there is generally a good reason no one else is eating at a place and its best to skip it, but the cute little historic house was just too inviting. We decided to take our chances and it paid off with a couple of perfect bloody marys for me ( extra spicy please) and some bubbly delicious mimosas for my hubby. We split the eggs benedict with chorizo and green chillies because we weren't all that hungry. It was great the chorizo wasn't all greasy and the flavors were really good. And the side of fruit it came with wasn't slimy! The freshly balled melon and grapes were crisp and sweet. The prices were really good and the staff was amazing. We will definitely be back for brunch and plan to try their lunch & dinner too."}
{"text":"come for the graveyard specials! they're cheap! always packed so takes a while but it's fun. too expensive otherwise"}
{"text":"A great and convenient place for any time of the day. After midnight, they have great specials!"}
{"text":"Food tasted like they took it out of the freezer or box and put it in the microwave. I'm giving it two stars because the people working here are nice, even if the waiter forgot our canned soup."}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe is located inside South Point. The prices are decent, and after midnight the prices are incredibly cheap. Nothing that wasn't extravagant or required reservations was open on Christmas, so my husband and I walked over here from the Grandview. I didn't think you could ruin something as simple as an omelet. They did. There was semi-melted sandwich slice cheese across my omelet. The eggs tasted watery and fake. The best part of my plate was the toast and jelly, because at least it tasted as expected. That's what I get for not planning a real place to eat on Christmas."}
{"text":"It is so nice to stumble across a gem like this.   A darling restaurant in an cozy old house in Phoenix.   Art on the wall to enjoy and purchase if interested.    The food is fantastic.   My husband ordered the pork tacos.  There were four tacos on the plate and the meat was deliciously tender and the tacos came with a small side salad.  I ordered the caprese salad and this salad came with the best dressing ever.  I would love to have the recipe.  The menu said that it was lemon en-fused olive oil, basalmic reduction....best caprese salad ever.   For dessert we shared the coconut cream pie.   Oh my.....perfect crust and filling.  Heavenly meal.  Thank You.  If you live near by and haven't given the Coronado cafe a try you are missing out."}
{"text":"I have been here more than 5 times so after that amount of time I feel like I can accurately provide a review. This is not gourmet food. This is not a fine dining restaurant BUT it is the perfect late night, cheap, simple and great bite everyone looks for. I love their late night menu. I can purchase everything on their menu (about 5 items) and not hit the $50 mark! The service has always been great. I have never had a even half empty cup, my table has always been cleared immediately if there was an unused and dirty plate. All the staff has been A1 - Seating to Cashier. I recommend this place and the hotel to anyone who likes a more laidback but great casino and eatery."}
{"text":"First time here and it is as good as home cooking. We really enjoyed eating breakfast and the low key feeling. Not unity like big casinos. We will come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"French toast was alright. Presentation wasn't good, so I figured, it would taste better than it looked. Could make what they serve here, at home! On a positive note: this place had good service, clean, didn't smell like smoke as in the rest of the casino (which is great), and fast service.   Bottom line, not a bad place to eat for 2 in the morning. Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Cozy. Charming. Comfortable. The three words that spring to mind when I think of our experience at Coronado Cafe last night.  We were a party of four, which is probably close to the largest party I would like to have there due to the intimacy of the space.   The converted house is quaint and elegant, but doesn't feel pretentious or fancy. The food was excellent, and the service was (mostly) good. The only dock comes from having to repeatedly ask to fill our tiny water glasses.   I had the vegetable rellenos with added flank steak, and my first thought when I took a bite was \"Oooh, I'm already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow for lunch!\" and then I proceeded to eat the entire thing. Darn.  I can't speak for my fellow diners, but everyone else's meals looked fabulous.  I had creme brulee for dessert, which was not the best I've ever had. The other desserts on the table, brownie sundae and caribbean bread pudding, looked divine.  This is a gem among the gems of 7th street, and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for their weekend brunch, and once for dinner during the week.  Dinner was not noteworthy. I can't even remember what I had.  Brunch is where this place shines.   Bacon = awesome! French toast = awesome! Bloody Mary = nice Mimosa = nice  I was disappointed by the Crab Benedict.   Service was good, our server was very friendly.   Our water glasses were never empty, and we get the check promptly towards the end of our meals.   I wouldn't go back here for anything other than brunch."}
{"text":"Steak and Eggs $4.95  midnight special .... Good right after a few drinks and dancing..."}
{"text":"I had a friend meet me at the hotel for lunch and we were deciding between this place and the buffet. I was buffeted out so we opted for this place. It was ok. Service was average. Food was pretty generic. It gets you in and out relatively quickly and is comfortable. We had brunch, but i think they serve everything all the time. I ordered this egg and potato dish and it was just pretty generic.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Pulled in for a late date dinner. This is another cozy dinner house living in a 1950's bungalow in the Coronado historic neighborhood.   We order up a lite and late dinner that included wine, sangria, crab cakes, salmon and mix greens. The dinner was excellent and our people were supercool.   Thank You!"}
{"text":"Best Banana cream pie in town. We stopped here around 9am on a Sunday morning before church.   Banana Pie: The crust is buttery and the whipped cream is doused on sky high. I could not get over the fact it was so flavorful, And had real bananas! I wish they sold the whole pie, I would have taken one home.   Traditional breakfast and lunch are served is huge portions at an exceptional price. The pancakes are huge and moist. They taste like heaven.   There is plenty to chose from on the kids menu as well. The chicken fingers are huge! And fries are super crispy, this is plenty for 2 kids.  The service was top notch. We had 2 busers and 1 waitress who kept our glasses full and even stopped by for a chat.   We'll be coming back and highly recommend this for the pickiest of eaters when you can't figure out where to go. There are many items on the menu to satisfy everyone's cravings."}
{"text":"Food quality is hit or miss.  I had the daily special which was the Swiss steak.  Three people in our party ordered the special and all of our steaks were tough and not edible.  We all sent it back and switched to the prime rib which was actually pretty good.  This experience tells me to stick to the menu items that are regular items and avoid the specials that are once a week items that limits the restaurant's prep experience.    Service was fantastic and the dining room is big so waiting times were reasonable.  I think it's funny that they have two menus: a regular traditional café menu and a separate Chinese/Asian menu.  From the outside you wouldn't know that there was a secret Chinese restaurant in this unassuming cafe.  There were several tables ordering from the Chinese menu and the dishes were served in distinct looking stainless steel platters.  From the looks of the food it seemed pretty good.   Give this place a try. If you don't like your order send it back and they will cheerfully replace it with something else and hopefully better for you.  Also if you visit after 11:30 pm -  the late-night menu is great and I don't think you can go wrong with the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"Slow as Christmas every time we have eaten here. Lots of servers but lots of confusion. Food ok."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin, how about we left and threw up? We didn't even finish our food and sent back a soup. This has got to be the worst place we have ever ate at. I got chicken and waffles and I thought, \"how bad can you mess that up?\" Oh they did. I can tell the waffles were frozen and warmed up, the chicken was the worst part. The chicken looked like fish. (Look at the pictures.) We ordered a hot and sour soup and only took on spoonfull of it and gagged. The only good thing of this place was that our server was really sweet. But other than that, this was the worst and I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My first visit to the 24hr cafe centered inside South Point Casino.  Coming in with mild expectations, the food was considerably hit and miss.  Starting off with the complimentary dry fried noodles....Haven't had these in years lol. Comes with the standard dipping sauces, and brought back more memories than enjoyment.  As for the GOOD, Salt & Pepper Sea Bass w/ Roasted Garlic ($23.95). EXCELLENT sea bass! Moist insides, light breading on the outside w/ strong garlic and salt & pepper finish!  The consistency of the fish was spot on, and the flavor was even better...highly recommended!  But for the BAD, Whole Imperial Peking Duck ($35.95). VERY disappointing, cooked way too long, with most pieces becoming dry and flavorless. Very LEAN duck as well...not much meat on these bones.  When the plate arrived to the table, I actually told the server that we didn't want the HALF portion...but was told we received the WHOLE duck!  Definitely NOT worth the money here.    Unless I got a very bad duck, I would run far away from this menu consideration.  I'm sure the midnight specials are the way to go here, or ordering selectively from the menu.  Perhaps the american choices are better represented?  Anyways, if you do eat here. order some sea bass for me!"}
{"text":"I don't think anyone in my family ever had smooth sailing at this place. We have fallen victim to billing issues, rude service, sour stomachs, rice so old it was crunchy, tough steak, hamburger that was cooked on a filthy grill ( the back has all kinds of black charred junk from the grill)....  That being said perhaps it was just bad luck.. but I personally don't care for much at Southpoint restaurants in general. I think this place is ok for convenience and I'd imagine they can't mess up eggs so breakfast is probably ok but do not go here thinking you are going to engage in fine dining or even yummy diner kind of dining.  Not recommended really, in my opinion just go to the coffee shop and eat a bakery item to hold you over til dinner. :P"}
{"text":"There is one dish that I order here:  Singapore Noodles.  It's thin rice noodles with prawns, BBQ pork and onions stir-fried in a non-spicy curry sauce.  LOVE IT!  If it's not on the menu, just ask for it.  Beside this, Coronado is a typical cafe with decent service."}
{"text":"Unique setting, great food, fast, fresh carry-out as well.  FOOD I've dined in twice and have had numerous meals to-go from here. The food has always been fresh and delicious. You can tell the ingredients used are freshest.   The burgers are hearty and sandwiches could almost be 2 meals for me- I'm small, though, so I don't eat a lot in one sitting... Nice wine/drink list and yummy desserts too.    ATMOSPHERE The Cafe is a brick home turned restaraunt. Very nice location for brunch or a date night and great for a casual lunch as well. SInce it was once a home, the seats are kind of close to one another- but still a nice setting.  OTHER The Cafe is very accomodating to special diets. They also have accomodated me last-minute (not my fault) for to-go meal for 10+ people, with a smile on their faces."}
{"text":"I like how open this place is, the tables are spread, and they provide you room. I hate those restaurants that got you sitting so close to other individuals it seems you know them lol.   We had this huge circle booth, and I was pleased about that. The menu had a lot to choose from, and I needed something a little different and something I haven't had in a long time.   I ordered a reuben sandwich. It was a good sandwich. The waiter also gave us space and didn't bother every 5 minutes. The customers who were around us sucked though, I was listening to two conversations at the same time because they needed to be so loud. Oh well you run into those loud ones once in a while lol.   The place was ok, and they have a lot on the menu"}
{"text":"This is my first review!!! Girlfriend said I wasn't really yelping because only did check in's without leaving a review :( So here we go... This a nice clean, friendly coffee shop in the South Point Hotel we a diverse menu with good coffee shop favorites. Would recommend if you are at the hotel."}
{"text":"The place is located inside of the South Point Casino. Between midnight and 6am, the breakfast menu combos are between $3 to $5 which are a pretty nice size. The sound is average to loud depending on what time you arrive at the casino. Food is good and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"Better than Dennys and quality around Cocos. Came here for breakfast. Got steak and eggs. Meat was good to great quality and eggs cooked over easy. Enjoyed the food and service was prompt. Prices are reasonable but atmosphere was \"okay\". Overall good place to come back to for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is yummy, cute and very comfortable...been on a date, with parents, with my friends and for special events.  You can't go wrong here - and I don't want it to be overlooked!  Go try it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the steaks served to us. I ordered medium-RARE as i always do for my steaks. My porterhouse came out medium-WELL. It was much too over done for my preference. There were 3 other steak orders. 1 was cooked correctly as my mother ordered her steak well-done and got it as ordered. My brother and sister both ordered medium steaks, but received them borderline well-done. I wanted our server. Elizabethx who was sympathetic to our situation,  to just pass on to the cook that he/she needs to do better. Elizabeth came back saying the cook offered to make another steak. Usually we would take them up on the offer, but our orders took nearly 40 minutes long that we were all just not in the mood to wait any longer (it wasn't even overly busy. We all took a few bites, couldn't deal with the tough meat at the moment, so we just packed up the rest to go. I usually don't need any condiments or toppings with my steaks, but i had to pour the remaining contents of the A1 sauce onto my steak in my to-go container.    The best part for my sister and I was the bread we received. Perfectly toasted and flavorful. My brother was digging his soup the most. Also, my brother's plate came with onion rings. Mine did not.   I took a comment card and am going to make sure i let them know they messed up. I don't want others to have the same experience"}
{"text":"I always like coming to this spot here at South Point casino & hotel whenever I stay here in Vegas. They have this late night special that runs from 12 am to 6 am in the morning and incredible deals on different breakfast items. Their most famous dish that I personally like to get is the NY steak & eggs combo, which is only $4.95!  My only markdown to this spot is that because its open so late the service is variable and can take a while to be served properly or even respectfully. It is especially bad when it is busy at night as it can be hard to get service or seated immediately either.  But I definitely recommend this spot during a late night meal craving after parties or events in Vegas. This is my best go-to so far!"}
{"text":"Service was great and waiter was very attentive. Food portions were huge and for a good price. Orders the Reuben with French fries and my goodness it was delicious. Heard this place is a hit for those late night post drunk cravings and I intend to try it out next time I'm there. So much food to choose from there and very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"You would think Vegas has the most expensive food yet. You can't judge the city by it's lights!  Here's Coronado Cafe in South Point Casino that we discovered has the ultimate late night hangover food for as low as $3.95! Served with however you'd like your steak and eggs. They also have hash browns and your choice of white or wheat bread on the side. Don't forget the A1 sauce or you could ask for the 57 sauce. There are also other special orders lower than $3.95. It's not the greatest food, but it will sure fill your stomach after a good one. I would say make it less greasy, but that's where I went wrong. You could let them know how you like everything.   My cousins and I went around 3AM and you'll still find people lining up just for the special till 5AM. They do have a separate menu of orders over $5, but their late night specials are what's great about this place."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely awful. The chicken patties where dry and burnt and the french toast had no flavor. We went for breakfast and server was excellent."}
{"text":"we came here on a saturday night to get the steak and eggs meal. got 2 for 9 bucks!!   - waited 15min to be seated. 5min to order. 35min to receive our food! go people watch. look at all the tables ordering the steak meal and be jealous -___- - unbelievable prices! i might just eat here every night and never cook again! lol - steak was made medium. basically the meat was cooked well done on the thin piece and rare on the thicker piece. good medium. lol - you wont get over medium eggs. good ol over easy.  - i'd come back again. maybe on a off night. SO CHEAP, definitely worth waiting an hour for. haha. well, almost..."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place without saying things like \"the food was edible\", \"charred on the outsides\" and whatever shenanigans? How about the food was NOT omnomnom? That's good enough.   It's a cafe...inside South Point. Don't expect much and don't drive all the way here for the food. I was meeting up friends who lived across the street so, I ended up here with them. I told them my dietary restrictions and they came up with the idea of ordering a turkey wrap (with chipotle mayo in the side) for me since I had to drive across town.  Everyone else got steak, omelet and a tuna sandwich. The general comment from everyone at our table: \"it was edible\". My turkey wrap came with French fries which is a weakness of mine. My friend knew it wasn't cheat day for me yet so, he asked for potato salad for him to eat. It came with fries anyway. I ate maybe 2 or 3 fries...or maybe 7 - they were good! But our nice server brought us a bowl of potato salad anyway.   The food was alright but it was the service that I liked. They were busy but our server was still oh-so pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"What used to be $3.95 steak and eggs is now $4.95 steak and eggs. But hey! Who cares? It's cheap! It's available after midnight everyday so on those days when we're out partying or bowling, we can always get steak and eggs after.  It's a slab of meat, hash browns, and two eggs. I always order my steak rare here because they have a tendency to overcook it.   It may also take a bit longer if they're busy so better chat it up! I tend to come here with a group of friends. I think one time we came at like 5 am and they ran out of steaks so be prepared! But that was memorial day weekend.   Great for a cheap bite :D"}
{"text":"Coronado Cafe is a fun little restaurant off of 7th, just north of the 10, tucked away across the street from a Cocos of all things. Do yourself a favor and duck into Coronado instead.  They have some fantastic appetizers, including this great brie & lavash dish and some fantastic salads with great dressing.  I've had their half-pound angus burger a few times and it's delicious. It's an $11 burger for lunch, and they offer a $14 version of it with some better ingredients for dinner, but it is perfectly cooked and dripping with flavor.   And then there's the Cookie. The Cookie need be described with a capital C because of its potential to destroy worlds and move mountains. The Cookie is a mound of dough, cooked through with just a bit of softness to the very center, drizzled in chocolate and absolutely amazing. Even though I had been here TWICE before, I completely forgot how substantial each Cookie was, and encouraged the two ladies I was with to join me in ordering a Cookie. One for each of us.  This was a mistake of the best form, as the three of us barely dented one, and we ended up bringing them home. They're fantastic and gooey and crazy and totally well-priced. (Under $5, if memory serves.)  Coronado is pretty tiny, so you're going to want to make sure you call ahead. They have a cute little patio that does its best to shield you from 7th, but it's too damn hot out even with the misters to do anything but inside.  The location is a bit odd to me, but the food is good and whenever I'm in the neighborhood, I'm happy to duck in. The service was friendly and our waitress was accommodating and took care of things in short order for us. Overall, a fun time every time I've been."}
{"text":"This is a great place for salads.  I'm very picky and was blessed that they use romaine lettuce.  I had the southwest chicken salad. They also offer a wonderful bread basket and crackers.  The blueberry pie was delicious. They open 24/7."}
{"text":"I decided I would like all my dining to be done at the bar of old renovated homes in downtown Phoenix.  Lucky me, I found Coronado Cafe. We stopped in for lunch so I did not order as much food as I normally like to when trying out a new restaurant ( it was a work day ).  Unfortunately, I will only be reviewing on item.  I'll make it up to you; I promise. We went during lunch and there was a wait for a table for two, so we sat at the bar.  The place is pretty small.  The bar was big enough for four people, five tops.  There was a nice selection of spirits and wine that I could see but not drink.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and chose the potato salad over the baked beans.  It was deliciously moist and the chiles had the right amount of heat.  The potato salad was very tasty satisfying side. It was a simple, satisfying lunch.  I would like to come back another time when they aren't as busy.  It was hard to get a server/bartender's attention and there's some cozy seating outside that's too hot to use at lunch in August."}
{"text":"We went for the midnight special and it was not very good.  We got the pancake Sanskrit and the ham was thin slices like you use in a sandwich.  The bacon eggs and hash browns were okay I guess but the bacon is thin super thin. The hamburger I order was horrible maybe because wartime wanted the breakfast specials.  I took one bite but the Fries were good the waiter was excellent and his assistant too, they refilled water and follow up with us.  He ran around crazy for his tables.  We tipped him as much as the bill came out on our check. He took my tha,burger off the tab because I didn't like it.  I didn't even have to ask for that and I wasn't even thinking that either,  I just didn't think the burger was good, it was well done and had a smoke burnt taste.  Yuck, I asked for it to be medium.  I wasn't complaining and said that it wasn't as good but it is okay.  He would get the five stars but the rating is for the value and the taste of the food. Sorry... Maybe it was a bad night??"}
{"text":"The Coronado Cafe is the place to be after a night of heavy drinking. When you need something greasy and carbohydrate laden to sink to the bottom of your stomach and prevent you from vomiting come here.   After midnight, a visit to this restaurant is easy on the pocket book. There is usually a short line, but the hosts(esses) are prompt in seating you. The wait staff look as if they are less than satisfied with having to deal with the locals, but I cannot hold it against them.   The food here comes out quick and accurate. I love the steak and eggs special. It comes with a nice cut of meat, two eggs any style, a heaping serving of hash browns, and a tower of your choice of toast. For less than five dollars this meal is a steal. That being the most expensive of the specials is a great sign of how cheap the other four specials are."}
{"text":"We came here for the prime rib special.  We both ordered it rare/medium rare with baked potato. The meat was as we ordered but the potatoes were cold and not completely cooked.  So we asked our waiter for new potatoes and to heat up the as juice as well.  When he came back with the new potatoes he proceeded to spill my husbands drink on his new pants.  Even though the waiter mopped it up there was a stain on his pants.  Here is the rub.....when we told the cashier standing right next to our table SHE LAUGHED AT MY HUSBAND.  All he wanted was compensation for the damage to his new trousers and an apology.  Finally the manager came by apologized and comped the meal.  We left still hungry."}
{"text":"We keep striking out at South Point.  We needed to eat before the movie,  first choice was Steak n Shake but they had a crazy line so thats how we ended up here.    We wanted Burgers and fries and thought can anyone really screw that up! The answer is yes! The burgers bone dry,  buns were stale and the avacodo was not fresh.  I compare the taste of the burger to something you would get at a gas station.   The staff was friendly but it took forever to get 3 burgers and fries. Not to mention $40 for burgers and fries should guarantee some sort of quality. Never again South Point!"}
{"text":"High over priced - food quality is really touch and go - $4.00 for a crapy cup of coffee is ridiculous - breakfast sandwich was smashed - corn beef hash was out of a can - biscuits and gravy were just ok - requested over easy eggs and were over hard - returned them three times and gave up - they did take them off the check - if possible just pass and go to to the deli for a bagel - that's what we will do. Bummer"}
{"text":"The mother fuckin pinnacle of late night dining aka after the club aka when you're shit faced dining.... $4.95 steak and eggs plus hash browns and toast.....you can't beat that....this review is based off late night aka after midnights aka the only piece of meat you getting after the club and while the steak isn't top quality this place still gives you that value that you be looking for in your chipotle burrito sometimes..."}
{"text":"For 14.99 I got a 14oz porter house steak, potatoes, onion rings, side salad and garlic bread. Not bad.  The customer service was really nice, the servers really know there stuff and put out a friendly environment.  Foods cheap, and good, but not that rememberable, not worth the drive out to South Point if there's no other reason too go."}
{"text":"My eggs were dry, and the hashed browns were greasy. My friend's breakfast burrito suffered the same. It was frustrating for our beverages, as one person in my party ordered a grape juice (they don't have it) and instead received a grapefruit juice. Service was disorganized and inattentive. Of the three meal experiences I had at casinos this week, this one was the bottom."}
{"text":"This place is a great value. The steak is very good quality especially for the price. We make a trip to South Point each trip, and have a meal at the Coronodo Cafe.   It's also cooked the way you ask, you get soup/salad, steak, and a potato for $12.99 (I believe). The lines aren't usually that long.   If this place was on the strip, you'd wait over an hour to eat guaranteed."}
{"text":"Cozy, cute and yes, a little claustraphobic...Coronado Cafe. Perhaps the latter adjective is my own issue, but at 5 foot  9 inches I felt REALLY tall. An adorable little home, with creaky wooden floors transformed into a comfortable cafe with approachable American fare. After navigating the dicey, sandy, lumpy parking lot I accidentally entered the kitchen door. My bad. I was redirected to another door and entered through the rear. Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit. I'm craving the tortilla soup and would love to try other items on the menu. Most importantly it was a wonderful way to hang with mom and dad (who ventured in from Sun City in their mini van, navigating the Central Ave. mess, God Bless 'em) and we truly had a good experience. Coronado Cafe. Cute. Cozy. Comfortable. And in the end, not so claustraphobic."}
{"text":"Can't beat their late hours menu!  Food for like $5.  I didn't want to dine in and ask for take out so we can take our food up to the room and be comfortable eating while watching some tv.  So we still sat at a table ordered our food, and as soon as it came we got to go boxes."}
{"text":"How this place ever got more than three stars is beyond belief. It honestly makes me question half of the reviews on yelp as this place has the worst service I have EVER had anywhere in my LIFE. At my three day stay at the South Point Hotel (which is actually pretty decent), I unfortunately ate here three times.   During all three times, I boxed  my food at the end of the meal to be eaten later but not once did I ever receive any utensils to use. Do I really need to ask for plastic to-go utensils when eating pasta, rice, or a steak? I think so.  Food here is AVERAGE at best but service here is honestly HORRIBLE. On the last night when my friends and I came back from EDC on Sunday at 5 AM, it honestly look the waitress 10 minutes just to get water to our table and then another 10 minutes to get our order. I asked MULTIPLE staff members as well as managers to send our waitress to us and yet we still waited. There were numerous amounts of other members on staff that could have taken my order but they wanted me to wait for this one specific waitress to take our order even though there were a ton of people standing around, LITERALLY doing nothing.   While the steal & eggs deal may sound appealing, the NY steak was honestly a  joke. I couldn't cut it with a chainsaw if I had one. I guess I shouldn't expect much for $5 but c'mon. I basically ate half of the steak and paid for some over-easy eggs with hash browns and toast. This place is a complete joke. My friends agreed that their food was HORRIBLE and that they would never come back.   Thanks for the painful shits, Coronado Cafe."}
{"text":"Food was good, but God the service is horrible ! I sat in the counter area , the seat was awkward to i asked if i can move to regular table , the response was not as expected . It felt like a stole something from them . They need to re-trained this fools ."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. This rating is for the 12am - 6am deals. The graveyard specials are great. Breakfast food for about 3.50, cheeseburger & fries for 4.00. It's not low grade food either. Service is fast and friendly. Only issue is that the line can be long to get in. If you're going solo, you can go to the bar area pretty quick though."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is Vegas. Everything is either really expensive or really cheap--this place is under the really cheap side! I used to go every weekend with my bf whenever he got off work. We love steak! This place is awesome. After midnight if you're 21 and over, or kids with an adult you can order off the Cab Driver's Special. There's normally a line around midnight. The wait is never really long though. I always get the steak and eggs,  med-rare. Comes with hash browns and also toast. The special ends at 6 am. How can you go wrong? They also have prime rib which is pretty good!!! They get a 4 because of price, location, and the food isn't bad!"}
{"text":"Came here at that awkward time between breakfast and lunch, some call it \"brunch\". I was surprised about the class and snazz of this place - though, from being in the Phoenix area for a whopping 24 hours I hadn't quite gotten the feel of the land yet. It seems like this cafe is in a bit of a side area of town, but it was happenin' anyways. The beer selection was great - can you already tell I didn't order breakfast?   My party of two got some beer, local and microbrew style. We had lots of fun looking over the martini menu, which was extensive, creative, and kind of grossed us out in certain situations, but in a good fun way. The friendly waitress came to us while we were nursing our beers to apologize for the delay of food, which my bf and I hadn't noticed. Anyways, the delay was because the cooks had to make us new, fresh beef patties. No complaints there!   The burgers were to DIE for, the side salad was fresh and came with tasty dressing, and the potato salad was just right. Overall, between the atmosphere, the service, and the deliciousness of the food, I give this place the best rating it can get."}
{"text":"Warning..do not order the meatloaf special, it looks and probably doesnt taste as good as the canned dog it looks like...the cheap kind. I ordered the salad on special the same day, i believe it was a cabbage, chicken with apple cider vinegar dressing, we the chicken was garbage, like that cheap pressed stuff, i found none of the lettuce/cabbage that was supposed to be in it (last week don't recall) and the dressing was some slimy concoction that was anything but vinegar..so much for trying to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Oh God, coming here was a waste of time, money, and caloric intake. I wasn't nearly drunk enough to warrant the food. They have cheap late night specials, but I think I'd rather haul my ass to Ellis Island for their food!  Service was SOOOOO slow.  Not only was service terrible, the food was even worse. We ordered several things. My boyfriend's dad ordered a soup from the Chinese menu. This dish was bearable. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs from the breakfast menu. It came with hash browns, biscuit, and toast. The country fried steak was TERRIBLE. It felt like the batter was made of eggs and flour and the meat was tough as well. I ordered the eggs poached, but they were completely overcooked. The worst poached eggs I've had, worse than those cooked in bulk at breakfast buffets. I ended up eating mostly biscuit and toast with jam and butter. The gravy itself was really good. The only highlight of the meal.  My boyfriend ordered the nachos. They were horrible. I don't even know what to say... He also ordered the steak meal and ordered it medium rare, as usual. The meat came back closer to a well done. It was terrible.   Overall, I wish I could turn back time and just eat at the Big Sur Oyster Bar next door."}
{"text":"I can't really say that the steak is one of the best I've ever had.  Heck, I can't even say that it's about average, but when you get steak and eggs, hash browns, toast, and jelly for $3.95, the LEAST I could do is give this place a 3 star.  Based on food alone, I'd probably give this place a 2 star.  The steak was a little bit tough but with a bunch of sauce and pepper it compensates for the texture.  The eggs, hash browns, and toast are a nice compliment.  All this for $3.95?  I have to give it an A-OK, especially with other steak spots coming as cheap as $12 for the same amount of food.    Come during graveyard to take advantage of the cheap menu.  You can act like a baller on a budget."}
{"text":"service was ok, food was so badly cook, so oily, and the ingredients are not fresh. But if you are drunk and hungry, this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Coronado Cafe. I'd heard great things and it's the type of place that is typically right up my alley, so I was very disappointed with my recent experience.   It's adorable - I'll give it that, but it was absolutely dead and such a buzz kill. We did a double date last Friday night and when we arrived at 8pm we were one of TWO tables in the entire restaurant. The wait staff was standing around with nothing to do and when the other table finished we were the ONLY table in the place so they started breaking down -- blowing out candles, picking up the tablecloths and literally turning lights off around us. They made it very uncomfortable and the antithesis of everything this charming, quaint, place should feel like.    The food was OK - two people in our group had the burger (decent - trying to hard with a weird mix of ingredients), pizza (undercooked, heavy and gross) and the meatloaf (the best of the bunch but still just okay). They were also very misleading with their sides and salads.   After being rushed out of the place so they could close down and get home we went to another local bar and realized we weren't offered the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour discount on our drinks or appetizers. Should we have to ask? It's printed on the menu and assumed it would be automatically applied to our bill - which was much too expensive for what we had.  Overall, a pretty uncomfortable and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"So I guess NO TAKEOUT option huh.   Geez Coronado Cafe, i wanted to try your grub up in my room very late in the night early evening and you did not come through for me dude, not cool at all.  Oh Well, from the looks of it there was a long line and I am sure it was well worth that wait, but at 3am all i want to do is eat and knockout!  Only place open in a mile span."}
{"text":"I've been here a few more times and the food is ok, I've mostly ordered Chinese food which has been decent.  I didn't like the War Wonton soup and they wouldn't let me take it to go when I haven't been able to finish it.  The lemon chicken is very good.  I ordered the chicken wings once and they came out like regular fried chicken, breaded.  Normally I don't like breaded wings, but these were actually moist and delicious.  So I guess I can make an exception here, except next time I would just order the regular fried chicken and not the wings."}
{"text":"This place was cute and clean and had nice personality, but when it came to the food it was very ordinary. These are dishes you can throw together yourself if you wanted. Nothing spectacular at all, I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner.  I had the pork tacos and they were awesome!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We rolled in about 9:30 on a Friday night and the line wasn't too bad. It was about 15minutes from when we got in line to when we were seated. Our waitress was nice and attentive as well as the gentlemen refilling our drinks. The food however was very disappointing. My sister had an omelette that seemed like they forgot to put the ham and cheese in it and just threw it on top. It was not mixed into the egg. I had the chicken noodle soup which was served barely warm. For some reason the main ingredient was not chicken or noodles but onions. Overall our money could have bought us a much better meal elsewhere. The service, however, was great."}
{"text":"If I can give you any advice,  it's NOT TO ORDER THE EFFIN PASTRAMI BURGER! There is human DNA in it!  It came with no pastrami on top.  The waitress took it back because she noticed that too only to return stating that it was already pre-mixed into the burger,  which looked frozen and hella dry.  They could market it as kobe burger and charge $50 with that claim.   Word to the wise, don't get cute, sell what is advertised.  There is fantasy football, but when it comes to eating, don't mess with with the hungry.  Other than that almost everything here is fantastic and very well prized.  Try harder please.  #nomysterymeat"}
{"text":"My family and relatives always come here for a late night feed.  Cheap but yummy food.  Only problem is the wait... but can't complain since people know where to get a good deal."}
{"text":"This is date night restaurant...  Nice sitting outside, cozy and nice music.  I love their drinks and they always have the best fish dishes.  The staff is best in town and the new owners are very fun.    The have the best meat loaf in town and they make it up very pretty with green chiles, yes green chiles.  We are regulars there and they spoil us on our favorite drinks and dishes.  Spot on!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights, Had late night breakfast 4 of those nights.   As most of the other reviews say, its hard to the Cab Driver's special steak and eggs served midnight to 6:00 am.  Its not great but pretty damn good especially when you consider the price of $3.95. Chinese food selections and apps such as hot wings are a notch lower in quality but still pretty good. Lots of locals who work swing shift or who are just out partying late also frequent this place. Overall a great place for late night base, can't speak for other times of day but it is almost always busy."}
{"text":".., based on our wkend experience here, I was never dissapointed.  They had a special from 12am til 6am for $4.95 steak & eggs. Seriously? How could you not eat a great deal like that? So we went, we tore it up, & then we went back to our rooms in a food coma.   The steak was done medium rare as I asked & were very tasty. I also had their minestrone & clam chowder, both were excellent. The service was ok, our server forgot my soups the first night, & our server the 2nd night was somewhat snappy. But all in all I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I always go here late night for Steak and Eggs. Though sometimes it gets busy, it gets worth the wait for the cheap prices after midnight. Their servers are pretty good, They are friendly and check up on you a few times seeing if you need any help."}
{"text":"The food was decent (not outstanding) and the atmosphere was excellent as this is such a nice restaurant setting. We enjoyed really friendly service and great cocktails at the bar but that service didn't move  with us to our table. Our server was off-hand and seemed permanently distracted (the place was not that busy) and made me repeat just about every word I said to him. OK so I'm British (lived in the US for 10 years) and so I try to speak slowly but this guy was just priceless, funny the first time he doesn't hear me, excusable the second time but by the third and fourth time, well I was done with him by then. This would have been a 4 star review but the seriously unimpressive table service puts me off coming back."}
{"text":"Gotta say I was a regular here maybe once a week for the graveyard specials. Loved this place after a long day and night of working. Today when I went with my cousins ive never seen the worst customer service EVER. My cousin texted his gf when we arrived at 3:11am and it took them long to give our drinks and take our orders. This is where the problem started occuring. Three different groups sat after us and was waiting as well. The couple next to us who sat after us got their food before we even had ours (1st complaint). Then we get our food and my cousin ordered buttered mushrooms on the side, well my other cousin got his steak and eggs did not order mushrooms but the mushrooms that were supposed to be on the side was the ones on his steak. We called the server to notify them what had happened. They took the food and maybe about 8 minutes brang back the same steak and egg plate with a bowl with a small portion of mushroom and my cousin finds a peice of egg and ham inside. Probably the cook just scraped the mushrooms off the steak and put it in a bowl. They then take it back put it on a new plate what do we find an egg. This is where we called the manager. Ive got to say with me myself being a manager in any business if there is a complaint you do your best to handle the situation. The manager on duty at the time had the nerve to say if we were sitting longer than 20 minutes waiting for our food she would have noticed. We tell her we got there at 3:11AM she says no that is not possible let me get the ticket that shows when you folks arrived. She points out you guys ordered at 3:29Am, sooo basically we sat for over 10 minutes before we were even helped. She then has the nerve to tell my cousin well they cook the mushroom on the same stove as the eggs. Like WTH kind of excuse is that. She said she will not charge us for the mushroom and drink from there it was like okay whatevers. I go to order another steak and egg plate medium. This is where I got pissed off. When I get the order about 15 20 minutes later and I go to cut the steak, it is warm and hard to cut. The steak was nowhere near medium in fact it was just rare. I cut it in half to verify it showing blood and strands. I call the manager over and she does apologize but worst thing ive ever had happened in a restaurant was she asked if it was okay if they put the same exact steak I cut back on the grill. NO that is not how you fix a problem with someones food. She then asks if its okay if they make a new one and already fed up with this dinner I just said take it off my bill and im leaving. Now is when we seemed to care that the chef was messing up because before I had the chance to leave she says I will show this to my chef. Like really guys come on no matter how bad of a day you are having you never treat customers like that. For that I will not return to this place for a long while. It may be cheap but for the service I received this last time it is not worth it. Idk whats different from the last months but there is a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"My Husband and I recently joined a bowling league at the South Point and Coronado Cafe has become our go-to for quick, cheap eats.  If you've never been to this cafe for their late night specials, you are seriously missing out. They offer super cheap steak and eggs (like $5 cheap), as well as biscuits and gravy and a bunch of other stuff.  Now that we have a baby, we aren't able to catch those awesome graveyard specials any longer, but they still offer great values at dinner time as well.   Their daily special is either prime rib or a porterhouse steak for $14.95. The meal is served with a potato and veggie side, as well as choice of soup or salad. We're not talking gourmet here, but it's a great meal for the price.  I recently discovered the sausalito burger and love it! It's what I think a patty melt should be - it has buttery, toasted bread and is super delicious!  Be warned - although this restaurant is huge, there is regularly a wait! The service is always fast and friendly and we've enjoyed our meals there."}
{"text":"Overpriced on the food and inattentive servers makes for a less than ideal dining experience.  We didn't receive the food we asked for. Once we sent the food back, we didn't receive our (corrected) order the way that we asked for it, prepared. (Don't expect your eggs to be anything other than scrambled.)  I added a second star for the convenient location inside of the South Point hotel...but didn't enjoy any other aspect of my meal experience at Coronado Cafe."}
{"text":"Ordered a filet mignon and while it was a very thick cut of meat they managed to cook it well done so I had to send it back.  Staff is very friendly and we will see how other menu options are throughout the week.   The large menu with lots of options is a plus at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great ambiance - small, quaint, cozy feel. Great for couples. Fabulous crab dishes - loved the crab dip app and the open faced crab cake sandwich was amazing. And save room for dessert - best creme brulee in Phoenix and the bread pudding was great too. And incredibly yummy sangria! All around great experience - food, service & ambiance all get an A+."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the infamous Steggs (Steak and Eggs) special at South Point for awhile, and we finally made it out. Boy we were not disappointed. So this review is specifically for the graveyard experience. 5 stars because honestly, you get what you pay for. If you are expecting fine dining steak, well you shouldn't be paying $5 for it. The priciest graveyard special is the steak and eggs (7 oz steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and 2 toasts) for $4.99. Other specials include hamburger and fries, biscuits and gravy, ham steak, etc. For the price you pay, the food was good. It was about the same level in taste as a Denny's yet even cheaper. But it's not all about the food. There's something special, if not unique, about the experience of chowing down on some freshly fried hash browns drenched in egg yolk porn with a meaty steak among other crazed casino nightmongers. We arrived close to 1 AM, and there was a throng of people waiting to get seated. The line moved fast, and before we knew it, we were behind the fences, surrounded by people of all ages and nationalities. I even saw families with young children grubbing down to some steak and eggs. It was a fun experience and I enjoyed people watching as much as I enjoyed the food. We will definitely come back again, despite not being fans of eating past 8 PM. Note: you can't get take out, but you can get boxes for your unfinished food."}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of those meals that is hard to mess up, but the Coronado Cafe does an excellent job messing it up. I had eggs over medium with corned beef hash (how in the would do you mess that up?)...let me tell you, with lukewarm hash and LUKE warm eggs - how in the F do you serve lukewarm fried eggs??  Husband had omelet made with boxed eggs (not unexpected) but it was dry and his potatoes were cold. On the plus side, and the reason for the one star, the coffee was very good. Not a breakfast adventure we, as locals, will be repeating."}
{"text":"Great place to dine of you are a night owl like me.  Graveyard specials for 21 and over no slot card needed from midnight to 6am. $4.95 7oz NY steak & eggs $3.95 1/2 lb cheeseburger and fries, ham steak & eggs, pancake sandwich. $3.45 for a traditional breakfast with bacon or sausage and eggs. $2.95 for biscuits and gravy.  Service is fast friendly and efficient.   Large open dining  area overlooking the casino."}
{"text":"Located inside the South Point hotel, this cafe is definitely nothing to write home about.  It just so happened my mom was ready to gamble before we hit the strip on the way into Vegas, and after gambling we were starved.  I would have chosen elsewhere, but this weekend wasn't about me.  The food is decent.  The service is fine.  The prices are cheap.  Not much else to say.  We had omelettes and they were good.  I've definitely had worse and I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"If I learn something in vegas is that the places to find chinese food that taste just like the one in New York is hotel cafes. This little places have such a variety but most of the ones ive been at, their Chinese food can reach epic proportions.  The café itself has what I call \"café service\". This means that the servers might ignore you, they might take forever to bring your food but your busser will be on top of everything making you wonder \"why the hell am I tipping the server for\" . Its pretty universal throuout the cafes , so I learnt to live with it and not get mad. It also includes an ok level on cleanliness . sometimes there is a mountain of plates right next to your other times its pristine  But the lines...ay dios mio!. The waiting line can be horrendous.When I see this line I seriously wonder if Depeche mode is signing authographs inside. By default the southpoint is always packed..and most of its clientel are café people (specially after all the restaurants close) so this can make your eating experience a little miserable. I stay away from it on the weekends because of this. If you are ok with lines, be my guest; but don't complain as you've been warned  Food..YUM! when I go I get two menus. The regular one and then the Chinese menu..everytime I open that menu little querubins come down and start singing in my ears. Yes its paradise.  I can tell by own experience . EVERYTHING on the Chinese menu is great. Yes everything .Ive tried it all so pick your favorite dish and love it. Specially if you like Ney York style kinda Chinese food.DONT expect the Chinese experience, but more of the east coast Chinese one  Lets don't assume that the other menu is bad. The portions and the choices are great. I am always pleased with the orders and most of the times are cooked right. You can get from breakfast to a full dinner here . Everything is \"café\" quality so don't expect a Joel robuchon meal when you are clearly not there nor paying the price tag .  Now, time to go to their sportsbook and make a quick pit stop at the café.. Lets hope there is no line!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. I went by myself to get something to go. There is no to go so I had to sit somewhere and order and they would give me a to go box. So the hostess told me I could sit at the only open seat at the bar. I went to sit down and the bus boy rudely told me that I had to get out of the seat because someone was sitting there. I was finally seated and I ordered and it took 49 minutes for me to get my food. I asked the waitress what the hold up was and she stated they were busy as usual. I'm thinking shouldn't the restaurant be prepared for this kind of rush? Long story short this place has unnecessary long wait, mediocre food, and bad service."}
{"text":"In a pinch, I had to find a place for lunch that was downtown, not overly expensive, and served both delicious soup and salad. A coworker suggested the Coronado Cafe, so I looked up the menu and happily discovered that it more than met my criteria.   For lunch, I had half of the Turkey sandwich and a small Coronado Gorgonzola salad. YUMMMM!!! The Turkey sandwich has a sort of cranberry relish instead of mayo (much healthier and much more delicious), and the Gorgonzola salad had apple slices and candied walnuts. It was the exact meal I was in the mood for.   The restaurant itself is almost too cute for it's own good. It's small, cozy and the absolute polar opposite of any chain restaurant. The service was great, and my food arrived quickly. I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The Coronado cafe is located inside the South Point casino.  Years ago a mediocre cafe such as this would have been the norm for a town like Vegas, but the culinary winds have changed and the lower quality food and cooking methods are a disgrace to hotel eating.  The food here is schlock house quality at best, nothing to write home about.   I had the pasta and it was one of the most horrendous dishes I've had in quite some time an insult to Italian food, sauce tasted like ketchup.  Once again it's better to either stick to the slots or avoid this place altogether. This casino needs to borrow some moves from their competition and get a celebrity chef onboard ASAP."}
{"text":"I only tried breakfast and it was decent however the portions seemed small to me.  There were no free refills other than coffee.  The price is slightly above Denny's for instance but not by much. It was not bad, but just not great either. For the remainder of the stay I went elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food here is just okay.   The $4 steak and eggs from midnight to 6am is a wonderful thing though. It's not the best steak ever, but when you're hungry in the middle of the night this is the place to be.   By the time it's midnight, all of the locals are already in line waiting to take advantage of the food at a cheap price.   The turkey avocado wrap is extremely dry. I've tried it a few times hoping it'd be better thinking that the previous times they lighter had an off day, but nope, dry each time.   The service isn't the best though. It's really slow and most of the time the waiter or waitress look like they want to be off work already."}
{"text":"After 5 years in Phoenix and so much anticipation of trying Coronado Cafe, I was extremely underwhelmed. Nothing was bad. Nothing was stellar. I didn't hate my meal, but was more perplexed by raving reviews after such a mediocre experience.  We kicked off our dinner with the infamous crab cakes which were delicious no doubt. That's where the enthusiasm ended. Having enjoyed them so much I decided to order the crab soup of the day which had a tomato and vegetable base and threw in a half Greek salad for good measure. My other half got the cheese burger. The soup tasted old and had no special quality to it with mushy veggies and completely pulled apart crab strings that made this like a tortilla soup without the spice. The salad was served on basic yellow romaine with no distinguishing qualities that set it apart from Souper Salad or Olive Garden.  For $11, I can't say I was thrilled. My beau's burger charted the same on his satisfaction scale - nothing to write home about.  The people were very sweet and the ambiance was cozy, but the ambiance was also...quiet. Very quiet, like empty quiet.  Perhaps brunch is bustling on weekends and the different menu poses more potential. But we won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"4 in the morning and craving a steak an egg meal? Look no further! only $3.95 here. Now that's a great deal in Vegas!!! You get what you pay for in portion and price but definitely a good drive to make off the strip. Expect the same service you get at any Ihop or Denny's."}
{"text":"Service was good. Pepper steak was terrible. How do you make fried rice so bad??"}
{"text":"When we go to South Point we have ate at this cafe a few times.   They do have some really good specials especially for late night ,  The wait we have found to be long at times and service can be a bit slow at times but of course it is always depending on how busy they are,  We have always ordered breakfast and we have never had a problem. The food is not too bad,  The prices are pretty cheap so if your here or close by and need some cheap eats this is the place to go, It is always clean and that's a big plus!"}
{"text":"Pretty much inedible. Ordered their French Onion soup and it was WAY too salty to eat. Server told me that French Onion soup is salty- yeah, no it's not supposed to be. My scrambled eggs were runny/watery and my hash browns lacked any potato flavor what so ever. I will never eat here again. Who cares if its cheap when its also nasty!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Coronado Cafe's Chinese menu offerings only.   We opened with an order of Crispy Spring Roll. Note that while the menu term is singular, this appetizer is actually composed of 4 spring rolls filled with both pork and shrimp. Cabbage and other vegetation was also stuffed into these medium-sized rolls, which were fresh, delicate, and crunchy as advertised. They were a bit springy, too, but not flaky--which is a good thing. Another enjoyable beginning to our meal were the complimentary deep-fried noodles that were brought to the table with Sweet & Sour Sauce, Plum Sauce, Hot Mustard Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil. The Plum Sauce was sweet, the Sweet & Sour Sauce was okay but not very sweet, and just a dab of the Mustard Sauce almost took my breath away. It was more intense than the Chili Oil, which carried plenty of heat in its own right.   The centerpiece of this dinner was the Wor Won Ton Soup. This was at least the fourth time I have had it, and it surely won't be the last. It featured abundant amounts of very large, succulent shrimp that one could crunch down on and enjoy a juicy flavor burst in response, white chicken meat, very good tasting wontons filled with pork and shrimp, some bok choy, thin lo mein noodles, and pork that was actually tender and very tasty. The chicken-based broth brought all ingredients into nice harmony. I also like that extra broth can be requested, and will be served without charge. This protein-rich soup is a meal in itself for two to four diners to share, but Diane and I somewhat foolishly each ordered another entree to go with it.   Her Honey Walnut Shrimp in Walnut Sauce actually featured large stir-fried prawns and nicely glazed walnuts in a mayonnaisey, tropical-tasting sauce that was accompanied by grapes and chunks of pineapple, honeydew melon, and cantaloupe. It was quite tasty except one prawn had a fairly large black spot where the crustacean had clearly not been properly deveined. Besides an unwelcome fly that arrived above our table just as we were finishing all we could eat, this was the only sour note of the evening.   My Beef with Snow Peas looked a bit dark and foreboding when it arrived, compared with most other entrees of this sort that I have eaten.  But covered by a very light Oyster Sauce, it was pretty tasty. The small snow peas were more flavorful than most longer-sized snow peas tend to be. The beef was not overcooked, and onion, carrot, corn, and mushroom included in the dish were not too soft and not too hard. Steamed rice was not particularly remarkable but a little sticky and a good side. I washed everything down with Chinese Black Tea, which I also enjoyed once I realized that it was neither Green Tea nor Jasmine Tea. The biggest shame is that, because we were about to see the Bronx Wanderers in the South Point's showroom following our meal, we couldn't take any leftovers home. I really hated to leave half of the Beef with Snow Peas, and a good deal of the Honey Walnut Shrimp as well, but we reluctantly did so out of necessity. The entree portions served here easily accommodate at least two diners. So, come hungry or else order less than you usually might at a Chinese restaurant.   Yes, the Cantonese food served at the Coronado Cafe is oriented toward American tastes. But, it is oh so very good. As was the service on this occasion. Overall, this was another scrumptious Cantonese meal at the Coronado Cafe!   The show afterward was great, too!"}
{"text":"I had the Seafood Creole, which was the special for $7.95 on a Friday in July.  I was surprised at how good it was!  It tasted very fresh and was generous with the seafood.  A decent cafe is high on my list of priorities so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very good      go for the prime rib      or the graveyard shift specials  midnight to 6 am"}
{"text":"It was convenient, and open. Located in the casino area, this place is easy access to food while on the gambling floor. There's nothing spectacular about the food or prices. The staff is friendly (which is always a plus), but nothing else to rave about.   If you want convenient and reasonable, this is an ok find. Now, if you're a night hawk or a really early riser, try the graveyard special (12am - 6am). Again, nothing spectacular but steak and eggs for $5? Can't beat that...lol"}
{"text":"very solid, CONSISTENT, good breakfast food. (also cheap :) ) i havent tried them for anything other than breakfast so cant comment on how there other stuff is. so far, the service and food has been good and no complaints :)"}
{"text":"There's probably better places with faster service and steaks ordered medium, which are actually well done.   The upsides are the graveyard prices and close proximity.   Or I just went on a really bad night. :/"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly owners. Wonderful outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Service * * * * * Food * * * Counter service available  This humble dining room sets the standard for good service. I was awestruck by the great attitude, work ethic, and skill of these amazing servers. How they manage to be cheerful on top of all that work is beyond me. This restaurant must have a world-class manager to assemble such a great team. They've forgotten more about good service than most culinary employees will ever know.  The high point: They clear the used dishes without making a sound! No passive aggressive busboys slamming dishes into a tub.  The servers bus their own tables and they clearly make diner comfort a top priority.   I wish I could say the food was better, but it wasn't bad.  Among three critics, there was one thumbs up and two thumbs sideways.   My Ruben sandwich was pretty good except it was soggy.  I guess they slopped on the sauerkraut without draining it.  When I picked the potato salad I had a hunch it wouldn't be good and I was right. Potato salad seems to be a great challenge for most eateries. (The dab I sampled at Jerry's Famous is an exception.) The pickle was just an ordinary one from the restaurant supply.   Another critic had spaghetti with meat sauce, which he described a pretty bland. It came with garlic toast that was more like French toast, he said.  Our third critic had beef broccoli from the Chinese menu.  She was very happy with it, saying \"The broccoli was just right.\"  I tried a sample but didn't care for it. It wasn't even as good as Panda.  Her vote moved the food rating up to three stars.  Judging by the steady stream of customers (including families with kids), I would say that the food here must be good enough.  It's a spacious, well-lighted restaurant. I guess the new smoking laws make it smoke-free.  Ventilation is good enough that you don't suffer from fumes drifting over from the casino.  I'm not a frequenter of casinos, so I could be wrong, but South Point seemed packed for a Monday evening. Are these neighborhood casinos usually this busy?    South Point offers some very good people watching. The crowd seemed more diverse and interesting. There was a tasteful selection of sizes, shapes, ages, physiques, ethnicities, and stereotypes.  There is quite a racket from the stun tunes and the slots, but it isn't unbearable like Red Rock."}
{"text":"This is definitely a spot for locals. Located off the strip, I would say 4 stars only because of the midnight specials. This is the place to go when you want a cheap meal during the late nights or after going crazy around the night life in Vegas. I've been here so many times with different thoughts. I was here last night with a great experience. My waiter was really nice and so outgoing that I knew I was gonna tip him from the start. I love friendly people! But this place has got to be a hit and miss because there have been times where service sucked and the food was off, but a majority of the time it's still worth coming. Tonight was another good experience. Our waiter was nice, straight, and to the point. Got our food fast. No complaints here. I recommend \"steggs,\" the steak and eggs, after midnight. Steak, hash browns, eggs, and toast for $4.95. Not too shabby after spending all you've got on the Strip or somethin. 4/5 for price & quality for what you pay. Open 24 hours. Oh, and I've also had their brownie sundae which was delicious and their cereal, which are both more on the pricey side. But coming here, I'll definitely stick to the late night specials. Always a place I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"The place lost its glory for late night meal...they were famous for the specials day and night.... no more quality significant drop...- all plates and food were as if came out of freezer. Served cold  and new rule menu has limit one special late night meal per person  they ration the food????  And definitely you will leave hungry  This is not what Vegas used to be or call hospitality in its name.... suggest go elsewhere  Better go to ihop or Denny's Big disappointment south point hotel"}
{"text":"the service is so great and its oh so romantic at night. I like going on dates here by myself or with great compant its so chic"}
{"text":"came here late at night after 12am, dont be lure by the long line outside, it doesnt mean food is good, it means service is f**king slow. food is terrible, no taste! yuck! prices are cheap but u get wat u deserve. shitty food. didnt even eat half of wat we ordered, maybe obly 25% of wats on our plate.  thats how terrible it was. im a local first time eating here but wil never ever go back. waitress served our food cold already also. terrible restaurant, beware!"}
{"text":"Came here 12/20/14 & ordered the chicken fried steak meal... Well the chicken fried steak, was not chicken fried steak, it was beef... The food had no flavor, but they give you a nice size proportion. So if taste is not important to you, then you will enjoy this place"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of it's Graveyard menu....$3.95 Steak and Eggs or $1.95 Biscuits and gravy!  This is the best kept secret and so awesome to break from your tables or return from a fun night on the strip to dine in your hotel or even take it up to your room.  PS it does run a bit slow as it gets crowded but service was great!   It's 12 - 6 am and for 21 and older only.   The food is well worth it especially cause my hubby and I were able to take it back to our rooms!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get food specials under $4. Service was not horrendous as they do get very busy here with high volume of folks lining up for good steggs after clubbing hours."}
{"text":"4.5* from me here.  This quaint little restaurant is a very good date restaurant.  At night, the indoor lighting is dim and romantic.  There are a few outdoor tables for the warmer nights.    The owners both work in the restaurant.  They're a charming couple who really seem to love what they do.  I happened to meet them at another local business one night.  They were absolutely wonderful.    I love supporting small businesses like this.  The people make all the difference.  The restaurant was empty save for one couple who were very amorous (and not at all shy about talking about their affections for one another) at the table immediately next to us.  Hopefully this is not the usual, as this place is really a delight.  We started with the Goat Cheese Bruschetta, which was quite delicious.  Then again, I am a sucker for goat cheese.  We then shared a Gorgonzola Salad.  We're not cheap, we just weren't too hungry!  It was delicious and the candied walnuts made the salad (though I only had a few since I am slightly sensitive to them).    Next we split the Blanco Flatbread with Roasted Chicken.  It was pretty good and very filling.  The parmagiano-reggiano absolutely made this dish.  Accompany all that with a couple glasses of Cabernet (heavy pours) and we had a great little meal.  We finished it off with a perfectly caramelized creme brulee.    One thing I loved aboout the place was that they are growing their own pomegranate trees.  It makes me wonder if the trees inspired the menu or...   Would love for an excuse to be dragged here again."}
{"text":"This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:  Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.  Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is small in seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.  Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.  recommended Food: Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus. Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss meatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty. Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended. Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few. Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example. Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.   Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it."}
{"text":"This cutie pie cottage restaurant serves up high quality lunch fare at a reasonable price.  It's a great soup, salad, sandwich kind of place for ladies who lunch.... there's the rub.  The place is tiny and the wait is ridiculous, even if you try to beat the crowd by going early. And the veggie sandwich isn't very good.  But other things on the menu are.  If you do have 2 hours for lunch and come here, be sure to get a cookie.  The cookies alone are worth the wait."}
{"text":"When Yelp says a 1-star is \"Eek! Methinks not.\", nothing comes close except for my experience at Coronado Cafe.  When I rate a 1 star, it pretty much guarantees that I won't be returning to an establishment for any reason. Here's why.  1. Service here is nonexistent.  Servers have little to no personality, or even any experience to serve in the first place.  Beverages remained unfilled, food orders were not accurate based on server's errors, One word: atrocious. That best describes the service that was provided here.  2. Prices are low, but for the bad service and food quality, this doesn't really get any props or anything.  3.  Food items are bland, but for paying $3, I guess you get what you paid for.  I rather pay $7 for the same stuff it is prepared correctly with service that actually mattered.  Overall, this was probably one of the worst dining experiences I ever had.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Servers were friendly but a little slow. My family enjoyed our meal! Definitely would be back if on the area again. Planning to check out late night menu tonight! Nice, clean environment."}
