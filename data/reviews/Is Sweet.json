{"text":"Great service and the honey sweet toast is fantastic for our weekly sweet tooth cravings! Definitely a regular with the wifey and puppy"}
{"text":"So glad my husband and I checked out this place. We got the honey toast with vanilla ice cream. Perfect portion size, perfectly toasted with appropriate honey drizzle on the ice cream. Perfect dessert to end the weekend. Not to mention great customer service, and cute decor. Will definitely return on a future visit."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, quaint atmosphere and wi-fi!  Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"First time here, and came here specifically to try the Honeytoast which was AMAZING! I got it with bananas and condensed milk. So fattening but so GOOD! Service here was great very nice and welcoming. They do have a sign letting you know that if you order Honeytoast it will take 15 minutes which was fine with me and they make sure it is perfect for you. The Thai tea here is LEGIT! I've been to a lot of places here in Vegas and have yet to find a place that serves really good Thai tea and I finally found it! Will come back again when I'm craving something sweet!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. 
Awesome experience.

Food: I ordered the Red Velvet Crepe Cake, was very simple taste but I realized whenever you put the strawberry syrup on top and mix with the ice cream you get the whole flavor which was not so super sweet which I loved. 
Drink: I ordered a hot Caramel Macchiato which was awesome taste right on the spot of sweetness, my buddy ordered a Taro Latte which was delicious.
Customer Service: The girls, unfortunately didn't get the names, were very friendly and helpful since it was my first time going.
Really loved the place super cozy to spend time with some friend or by yourself doing homework.
Definetaly a place I will come back A LOT."}
{"text":"Dude super delicious! Ordered some honey toast and chomped down like crazy!!!! 

Great customer service

\" fuego\" 

So fuxkin delicious looking"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Very hard to find since its at the end of the building. But great customer service from a young man when I came in on Wednesday Sept. 30th. Ordered a chocolate cake and strawberry ice cream. I thought they were going to put the cake on a small plate and the ice cream in a bowl but instead it came on one long plate designed with fruits and syrup. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Mille Crepe cakes(Red velvet and Green tea) and I can't help but compare it to the very popular and elite Mille Crepe cakes of Lady M in LA. This one is a little bit better than Lady M in some ways. The sweetness is just right, Lady M tastes a little bland. Also, the crepe is softer in consistency so it's easily sliced and has more melts-in-your-mouth texture when you bite. The service is quick and the cashier was respectful and friendly. The food presentation is excellent. Two things  why I'm giving it a 4, those are 1) the unnatural green color shade of the green tea which makes me think if they really used the natural matcha green tea powder. 2) I noticed a tiny white hair strand in in my ice cream scoop. I kindly informed them about it and they quickly replaced it and apologized. It's no biggie, things like that happens sometimes. 
The ambiance is airy. Thr drinks we ordered have this hint of floral after-taste which was unique."}
{"text":"I feel so spoil when getting my sweet tooth fix in Las Vegas. Places like Sweet Raku, Bouchon, Jean Philippe, Paris Baguette n Is Sweet r classier than your neighborhood corner cafe bakery. So obviously the price can be a bit more steep. If U feel like splurging or is entertaining guests or that special occasions. Is Sweet is a perfect place to show that special someone. This place can be crowded on weekends, so  go during daytime or weekdays if U want to score a good spot to enjoy that moment!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try their red velvet crepe cake, and here i am~ok, they made the plate look very nicely, the taste, um...with that price, it can do a little better. Not very sweet, which is good, that way i can finish the whole piece with no problem."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout. If you love desserts, definitely a must try! Waffle with chunks of brownie and vanilla ice cream is amazing! Gave it a 4 star since I expected more from the macha green tea crepe but still good. Desserts are not too sweet!"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice after-meal dessert, enough to satisfy your ultimate craving of carbs and sugar? Then IS Sweet is your best bet. I've been to this place several times now, and it never fails to satisfy my sweet tooth. Boxed Honey Toast ala mode, crepe cakes, and waffle ala mode are the 3 contenders that showcase the cafe itself. They all come with the option of having ice cream, different flavored syrups, and a variety of fruits to choose from. Aside from these are coffee and other nice drinks. In my opinion, the best time to come here is around night, where you can chill after a long day. Why did I take a star off? Well, seating in the cafe is quite fashionable, but not to my liking regarding comfortability. I find the seats to be all oddly spaced out, but no big deal. The point of being there is for the dessert. Now, onto customer service. The cashiers are always usually nice and smile as you decide on your order, and never fail to giggle if you express your excitement towards satisfying your sweet tooth. Overall, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Good for iced coffee but the crepe cake was not very fascinating. Was expecting the taste I had in beverly hills however the taste was not there."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere here, great service, and the drinks/ dessert are great. I would recommend it to anybody who has a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Great all around bread is delicious the teas are colorful and tasteful just get here earlier for there slices of cake they go fast for good reason will come again"}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe, the red velvet latte and strawberry cake were delicious! Very cozy and inviting atmosphere, with friendly and helpful staff. Great place to end off a date night with coffee and dessert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"love this place! The macha crepe cakes are the absolute best! and it's so adorable, i love the vibe"}
{"text":"I went in on a very hot Las Vegas day and was craving something cool and refreshing. I went in and was immediately greeted by the very friendly staff. 
I ended up ordering a Thai iced tea and a green tea crepe cake. The tea was perfect-not too sweet, not too strong. The crepe cake was beautifully presented, with a tiny saucer of green tea sauce (amazing when poured over vanilla ice cream), and a small portion of fresh fruit. 10/10 would go again and recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened and the desserts and service is still just as great! I love the workers/owners.. such friendly people!! It is always nice to see their familiar face when arriving. I love coming here to study or hang with friends. Also a great place to grab some dessert after a meal from any of the surrounding restaurants. I am happy they are open later now than when they first opened. I always get the honey toast or green tea crepe cake. You can't go wrong with either of those! The desserts taste great and the presentation is always lovely. Everyone that I've brought here love the place. Also, most of the time they offer some sort of deals when you check in on social media or yelp. I love this little spot and hope this great service and quality never change."}
{"text":"I only got to try a couple of their desserts and they were tasty! Just the right amount of sweet. The presentation looked like a work of art, as if it belonged in a museum. The atmosphere was quiet and cozy probably because we went around 8 p.m on a Wednesday night. 

The reason it doesn't get the full five stars is because of its location and outside aesthetics. It was a bit difficult to find, also not enough parking it seems. Other than the location everything was great!"}
{"text":"Area took forEVER to find. Go past the Churches Chicken, then the Cazino area on the right and immediately turn into the private lot on the right and it's at the end. 

But the area inside is cutely quaint. Great music and a nice hipster feel to it with a generous staff to match. 

When it comes to the menu, they currently have a deal where you can get a dessert and a drink and get 10% off your total bill. 
We went with the popular choice: Green Tea Crepe Cake with a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream (optional, but suggested) and I got a Taro Milk Tea. 

The Green Tea Crepe Cake was very delicate and the green tea crem√© that they give you lets you take control over your own sweetness, which I thought was classy. The cake itself is done very well and is not overly sweet. They pride themselves in their plate presentation here so don't expect each Green Tea Crepe Cake to come out looking the same! It's about their individuality! 
The Milk Tea is very standard but a good accoutrement. 

Overall a very nice place and I would return!"}
{"text":"Everything in their menu is crazily delicious, EXCEPT their waffles! Good ambiance and customer service as well. Since they serve signature crepe cakes, I hope they add regular crepes with choices of different toppings and fillings to their menu."}
{"text":"We stopped by here just before heading off to the airport. I really wanted to try their crepe cakes and the matcha one is an excellent choice for those who don't really have a sweet tooth. But don't panic, it definitely does not taste like grass! The layers were beautifully even and delicate... 
We also got a rich chocolate cake that was delicious as well! 
The honey toast was my first time ever trying something like that and I LOVED it! The bread is fluffy and sweetened by the honey but still has a crisped top! A really cute hidden gem close enough to the Strip for the perfect afternoon tea.."}
{"text":"The desert was good. However it was way too pricey. It's too much money for something so small and it's good, not amazing. They need to tone the prices down. This isn't somewhere I would go all the time."}
{"text":"This dessert place is amazing. Food was great but the waiting took so long. We came in 10:06pm, food were served around 10:40ish. We were wondering what took them so long, night wasn't busy that much tho. Anyway, good thing their tiramisu and creme brulee are the bomb cos if not, we're not gonna go back anymore."}
{"text":"Went here because my sister told me about this place! The decor is very cute and different! It looks like a tea party for grown ups. There was a special when we went here which was buy a dessert and drink and receive 10% off. 
What I got here was the honey toast with vanilla ice cream on top. My cousin got the green tea crepe. The toast was ok because the honey tasted a little off and it was overwhelming. It does not taste like most brick toast. The vanilla ice cream was very good! I tasted the green tea crepe and it was good as well, not a very strong matcha taste. We originally ordered the green tea ice cream, however, they told us that it was too soft since it was freshly made. Which was a bummer since I love green tea ice cream. 
The drinks we got were hot matcha and hot sesame. The matcha was outstanding! Super good and full of the matcha taste. My cousin got the sesame and said it was ok because she prefers to have a strong taste of sesame."}
{"text":"Drinks tasted okay, but definitely a little over priced. Not as great compared to other drink places in Las Vegas or even on Spring Mountain.
Customer service was a bit weak as we waited for 40 minutes for our drinks, and they forgot to make our Taro slush. We had to remind them after 10 minutes of receiving our other drinks.
I would've honestly rated them a 2, but the guy apologized for forgetting and gave us a free scoop of ice cream. Also, the melted cheesecake was pretty tasty.

Extra: They DO NOT sell any drinks with boba. I have no idea why this location popped up after I typed \"boba\" in the Yelp search bar."}
{"text":"I love this \"sweet\" jewel in the middle of all the hustle-bustle in las vegas. Tried their Coffee cake and Matcha/green tea Crepe cake and I must say, I'm wanting more! It's not too sweet, just how I like my desserts...paired with Caramel Macchiato which made it perfect."}
{"text":"Pleasant chill spot tucked away in Chinatown. Reminds me of dessert cafes in City of Walnut. Small business, comfortable atmosphere with hipster style decorations. Appears one person is working the counter while tending the tables and assume making the desserts. Definitely a place for younger people yet friendly for mid 30's peeps like me. I see myself coming back for another try."}
{"text":"I luv the freshness of the shake and the cake are yummy.!! I will absolutely come back again...yummmmy to my tummy."}
{"text":"free wifi, great service, beautiful deserts that taste delicious and a lovely atmosphere for you to sit down and chat while sharing some laughs! I enjoyed this cafe very much! thank you!!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying this place is great and the energy is great, the service as well. To top it off their coffee, tea, and desserts is amazing. Love, love, love em. If you haven't yet I highly recommend you guys check this place out for yourself. A group thumbs up"}
{"text":"No boba or milk tea. U have been informed. Cafe drinks only. No idea what the quality is for those since I left and the customers behind me."}
{"text":"I've seen so many posts about this place and I'm so happy I was able to finally try it. 

We got the honey toast with just maple syrup and vanilla ice cream and it was amazing. Crunchy on the outside and soft and moist in the inside. Definitely would recommend this! They have plenty of other toppings and syrups too. 

I tried the matcha green tea crepe cake as well. It was pretty good. I've had the green tea crepe cake at gyu kaku and that one is still my favorite. But it's pretty and sweet to try. 

The iced cafe latte with vanilla is also on point. Im very picky with my coffee but I very much enjoyed this coffee. 

Overall, the desserts and coffee were delicious. Id definitely recommend this place. The place is small and cute to just hang out in. The gentlemen who helped up was very pleasant and happy to serve us. 

The only down side I would say is that there's only that one worker and it takes a little bit of time to order and receive your food."}
{"text":"After dinner we decided to get some boba tea and this place does not have boba but still decided to give it a try. I thought it was a bit on the pricier side for drinks and dessert. Ordered two drinks and two dessert and it came close to $30 with tip. The hot chocolate milk tea was basically got coco and the hot seasame milk tea was tasteless. Was not too happy with my drink but oh well, went there to hang out with friends after dinner. Friend order the honey toast with a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top, that looked good. The other dessert was ok, seems like something I can get at Costco."}
{"text":"I wanted to find the best crepe cake since it was my first crepe cake experience. I found this places on yelp. I love the decor and design of the place. The Batistas are super nice. We ordered a red velvet crepe cake and hot chocolate. The Batista ask if we want to add ice cream on it. We immediately said yes. We got our order pretty quick. The presentation of the cake was very nice. I guess I was expecting a very wow factor like crepe cakes are the best thing ever but I didn't get that. The taste was ok. Maybe green tea or vanilla would be a better choice. The hot chocolate was a but water down. So we asked for more syrup. But instead they were very nice and us made a new one. Hopefully we'll return and they have more variety of cake favors."}
{"text":"Went in to try the green tea cake. Food was nicely decorated and brought out quickly. I wish I brought the utensils home haha. Taste wise, it was decent. Anyone who has a sweet tooth and likes cute looking food should check this place out atleast once."}
{"text":"What a cute little shop! Came here for desserts after dinner with friends and thoroughly enjoyed it! We got lost though since the directions provided on Yelp was not accurate/tricky. Just an FYI, it's in the the plaza where Viet Noodle Bar is located. We arrived pretty late and I can only imagine the challenges people face with parking during a busy day.. 

Anyway, we ordered the green tea crepe cake, iced taro milk tea, rose water green tea, and honey toast! I love how the crepe cake was not too sweet and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. My friend who ordered honey toast never had it before and the guy who assisted us was very patient and even provided recommendations to my friend. Kudos to him!"}
{"text":"The employee was very helpful in making sure my kids could share a slice of cake.  I forgot her name, but she sure went above and beyond to ensure my 2 toddlers wouldn't fight over pieces of their strawberry cake.  I just wish there was more cake options.  Other than that, cute little sweet shop!"}
{"text":"Love this new local coffee place. I'm glad it's closer towards the center of the city. Desserts were plated beautifully and staff were friendly. I'm glad to have another option for a chill place to catch up with friends and family. Coffee and desserts were satisfactory for the three of us that went in tonight."}
{"text":"I stayed in Vegas for a short vacation & found this cute little cafe on yelp! It has a very cozy vibe, as there are a few comfy chairs and tables, along with some hip decor. The matcha crepe cake was superb; I loved how you can drizzle on the sauce yourself. I did expect it to be more sweet, but it fulfilled its purpose of tasting like matcha and wasn't overwhelmed with sugar. I also tried their white chocolate frappe, which was just alright. I enjoyed it, but I could taste the powdery substance used for the white chocolate flavor. 

I would come back if I was in town again because they have more desserts I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to go have dessert after eating Vietnamese soup down  the way. We had the toast with green tea ice cream mangoes and blueberries very nice."}
{"text":"So finally got to go there. Everyone was saying how perfect and tasty their desserts are. All I could here was \"OMG, you gotta go there, try crepe cakes, try frappe, etc..\"  So we ordered Matcha crepe cake, with vanilla ice cream and nutella frappe. Yes, I can say OMG, wow, but just for nice look of the plate. Crepe cake with matcha sauce certainly looked green and nice, but taste had nothing to do with matcha; just buttercream that overpowered everything and gave you disgusting fatty(not even nice buttery taste) coating over your palate. Ice cream was okay, once you wait few minutes for ice crystals and pieces to melt from it. Kiwi and strawberry that came with it were frozen and unripe. Ridiculous!!!! 
Frappe was kind of good, you can't go wrong with Nutella(still not good nor great, but just okay). 
But seriously now people, if you don't know different between good and bad dessert(buttercream is bad) don't suggest something to someone. Check you taste buds before you say this crepe cakes are amazing and delicious.!"}
{"text":"I'll give this establishment 2 stars for a nice decor. However, I walked in at 11:40 and was told they stop taking orders at 11:30. I suppose I'm confused why they would still be open for business if they will refrain from actually conducting business before their closing time. Additionally, when I walked into the store and went up to order something, the cashier seemed to assume like it was obvious that they wouldn't be making any other orders and was somewhat rude about it. I probably won't be coming back although I would believe that they have good beverages/food."}
{"text":"I love Is Sweet crape cake . It's the best in town.  Try red velvet latte it's super."}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is their sweet bread is to die for. You can add different toppinvs and it was very reasonably priced. I will come back during my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"No thank you never going back and they tasted like flat berry paste will cardboard cut out icing flowers that looked like I could eat but were stained dye color and I ate them or tried to eat them I need to not do that."}
{"text":"Tried the honey toast with nutella, condensed milk & green tea ice cream. The honey toast had a nice crispy texture as my fork pierced & picked up the delectable combination of dessert happiness"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The honey toast is choice. You can build your own and you can't go wrong with a combination. Bonus points for being open late."}
{"text":"Great selection of crepe cakes and drinks. Crepe Velvet cake taste good and love it. Place is  clean and the interior design were simple and good crowd. Cream brulee looks good and will order them and try it on my next visit. =)"}
{"text":"I think this place needs more exposure. there needs to be a sign that says this place is also in the lil plaza cause if it wasn't for Yelp, I never would've found this place or knew it existed.

I LOVE THE LYCHEE ICED TEA. THAT'S ALL IM SAYING. tea is amazing. matcha crepe cake was the hype, but it was good nonetheless. I came here after eating pho at Pho Kim Long (only a mile radiance), and it had to be the perfect dessert ending.

awesome."}
{"text":"Honey toast is very delicious. Coffee is also very good. Staff are nice and always smile at you"}
{"text":"Best dessert!!!! Try this new place you will never regret it!!! Nice atmosphere, nice servers, nice service!!!"}
{"text":"nice decoration :) must try crepe cake so yummy 
Honey toast is another dish that i tried.
Drink is good as well. Love this place"}
{"text":"I've been to this cute cafe/dessert place multiple times. I fell in love with their honey toast and matcha green tea crepes! They definitely know how to make everything cutesy and presentable! I would highly recommend this place for dessert lovers! And this place is such a great place to hang out with friends and just catch up! I'm glad i found this place!"}
{"text":"We had honey toast and it was great! First honey toast and great experience for a first time. Ours was with banana and green tea ice cream. Great service as well! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I get the Matcha Mille Crepe. I also wanted to try something new, so I got the Tiramisu. I knew that the tiramisu had a coffee taste, but the ones they have doesn't have a strong coffee taste unlike those I have tasted before. I really like it! The presentations of the desserts are really nice also. 

However, their desserts are a little pricey. And the one who was taking my order seems like he wasn't in a good mood. I understand that everyone has their bad days, but good service is a factor for me when going to restaurants, eateries, etc."}
{"text":"Helpful staff (she seemed to be working alone but was super efficient), delicious honey toast, and super refreshing cold drinks. We shared one honey toast with strawberry sauce, a Thai tea, and a blended matcha drink (I can't for the life of me remember what it was called but it was yummy). Cute little place with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Oh my this place is a hidden gem. I heard about \"Is Sweet\" from a friend and I'm glad to have listened. 

We tried the matcha green tea crepe cake and it was delish, the sweetness of the cake was perfection. My friend and I will definitely be back to try the other desserts they have. Can't wait to bring my sisters too who love to try new places and of course cakes."}
{"text":"Great food, great presentation. The food looks as good as it tastes. Looks to be like my new favorite spot :)"}
{"text":"Cute little dessert shop that offers pieces of sugary heaven. The name suits it perfectly. 

Must try is the Honey Toast ($5) with your choice of toppings (extra charge). My choices were condensed milk, chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream. Simple. The condensed milk adds more creamy goodness into the toast, while the cold vanilla ice cream tops it off with the warm toasty bread. Perfection. Another great option is the strawberry toppings for that fruitier taste. I have not tried the cakes, but I already can tell they are delicious as well.

I love the interior decor and atmosphere of the place. Nice place to hang out with your friends, but not spacious enough for big parties because of the sizes of their tables. Great photo ops tho. 

Tip *** It is not noticeable to find from the streets. No signage available. When you see Viet Noodle Bar, go in that plaza towards the back."}
{"text":"Lovely sweets! cute and cozy place quietly tucked at the end of the commercial place. great place for hot drinks & sweet toast."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's a small cafe with comfy chairs and a larger table. The honey toast is delish and you can put whatever toppings you want in it but my absolute favorites are the crepe cakes. I've had the strawberry and matcha ones and it's like biting into a cloud we would go here after eating ramen or Japanese curry. Best dessert and worth the $$$"}
{"text":"Is Sweet is a cute little coffee/ tea house that serves desserts like slices of cake, brick toast, shaved ice, ice cream. Located in Chinatown, in the same plaza as Viet Noodle Bar (which is located on the corner and can be seen from the street). Just head towards the back of this plaza and you will find Is Sweet.

My husband and I were in the area this past Friday and decided to stop by. We arrived around 8:20 pm. The female employee behind the register had a heavy accent and so I had some trouble understanding her. I felt bad that I had to ask her to repeat herself several times as I had asked questions about the crepe cakes. I do appreciate that she tried and was patience and still smiling despite my repeated asking her to say what she was saying one more time. 

I ended up purchasing Matcha Crepe Cake (to go) $6.50 prior to tax ($7.04 after tax) and consumed the next day (since we were full from our dinner). Since I had ordered this to go, I had a side of matcha sauce packed in a small container. However, if consumed on site, a chocolate drizzle is placed along side the cake (but customers are given a small cup of the match sauce to drizzle on the cake on their own). I thought the cake was very moist and not too sweet, even with the added matcha sauce. My husband liked this cake but thought it would have been nice to also have the chocolate sauce provided to give another added complement flavor to the cake. I am really a fan of crepe cakes and though each layer was perfectly moist and had just the right amount of creme between. 

Wait time was longer for our slice of cake than I had anticipated. I think the employee who took my order may have forgotten about us because I caught her looking surprised as she turned around and saw me (I was sitting across the room, as I waited for my order). Then shortly after, our to go order was brought out to us. 

The prices do seem a little bit more pricey than your typical tea house (there are some fruit teas available for purchase, served in glass mason jars if you choose to enjoy your drink here on site). But I would still probably come back here anyway to try one of the other desserts that they have and most likely would order one of the tea drinks while I am here (I am not much of a coffee person, but they do have several coffee drinks to choose from). 

I like that there is free WiFi available to surf the net and I also like that there is outdoor seating here so that I can bring my 4 legged little girl the next time I am out here in Las Vegas. 

I do want to mention that the indoor seating is kind of small though and was rather busy while we came in. 

Also if you wish to order one of their crepe cakes, it comes in 3 different flavors: matcha, vanilla, red velvet. And lastly, the current Yelp check in offer is 10% off 1 beverage. 

Is Sweet is a cute place if you are into coffee/ tea Asian houses and wouldn't mind adding a dessert to your get together with your friend(s) and/ or date night."}
{"text":"Great place..Desserts are so delicious..I always try one new Toast..I love going with my family and chill.great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Their honey toast is made perfectly. My favorite toppings are banana and vanilla ice cream. The bread is toasted perfectly while still being soft inside. Best honey toast I've had in town! And affordable as well."}
{"text":"Cute  spot to chill with friends. I couldn't decide so I ordered the iced caramel macchiato and matcha frappe with matcha crepe cake. Pretty darn good. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I have only been here one time but I enjoyed my experience. I had the honey toast topped with Nutella, strawberries, whipped cream and strawberry ice cream. It was amazing. They made it fresh and it was more than enough for two of us."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get dessert whenever I come to Las Vegas.  One of my favs is the unique honey toast with vanilla ice cream, with a side of strawberries, topped with whip cream and condensed milk .  A must try spot!!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here since it's her favorite spot.  The desserts and drinks are really delicious! Would totally recommend this spot to get a caffeine or sweet tooth fix."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee and dessert shop, it's kind of hidden cause it's at the very back part of the parking lot. Owner recommended for me to try the green tea crepe cake and also the caramel macchiato, my girlfriend ordered hazelnut frappe, the green tea cake is to die for, light and fluffy and really nice green tea flavor, the coffees are good as well, strong coffee flavor, not too sweet just right amount of sweetness for me. I recommend for everybody to try this little shop, nice ambiance as well. Good for coffee dates."}
{"text":"First time here, loved the staff, drinks, and desert. The desert is the BEST! Will come back for sure. 10/10 wow. Will plan to get diabetes here."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've had their green tea crepe, red velvet crepe, white chocolate latte. Nice place to hangout take some dessert pics :-P and indulge. 
Wish they had some food here too. I'm definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"It was Amazing loved the Matcha Cr√™pe & Tiramisu its a hidden gem in las Vegas authentic Asian bakerywill be back soon. Located in China town. Little bit hidden, Never saw of before.i Found them on Yelp& happy that WE tried it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love IS SWEET. From the decor to the tasty treats, this place is great. The decor makes the place nice and cozy, although I will say I was too tall for some of the lower tables... haha.

My boyfriend and I ordered a taro frappe and honey toast with vanilla ice cream and bananas. I wanted boba in my smoothie, but this place doesn't have it. The taro frappe arrived first, and I like the mason jar they put it in! The frappe was really good. The honey toast was AMAZING. The toast was perfect with the ice cream and bananas. I the middle of the toast it was buttered... so. dang. good. 

The reason I give IS SWEET four stars is because the honey toast took forever. We were done with the frappe by the time the toast got to our table. I know the toast might take a while to cook, but they should have waited to make the frappe until the toast was getting closer to being done. If the place was busier when we were there I can't imagine the wait to get your desserts!

Other than that, the desserts taste great and is in a good location. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas to try other tasty desserts!"}
{"text":"My gf and I were looking for a quiet cafe and I used my Yelp to find one around our current location. We were so happy to find this place!! The matcha crepe is so decadent. It's not very sweet but the smoothness and flavor is to die for. The sauce is the key! We asked for more sauce as it wasn't enough. Thumbs up to their Tiramisu too but I'd try the Matcha crepe. My next order will be the red velvet crepe when I go back."}
{"text":"Very cute little dessert place! 
So many things to offer and a very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"This place was really yummy and cozy. The decor is cute. We got the coconut cake, and matcha crepe cake, and we were surprised by how tasty but not too sweet they were. My Nutella hot latte was also pretty good. It took us awhile to get our food, that was the only thing. Next time we'll try the honey toast, knowing there will be a little bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Pros: The matcha green tea crepe cake was phenomenal. The presentation was on point. Good date spot. 

Cons: Hard to notice the place, it's located in the back of a strip mall with very limited signage. The tea was served way too hot. Limited seating on a crowded Saturday night."}
{"text":"Love this place!
You must try the pistachio latte, delicious.
Always a friendly smile behind the counter, with good services following.
The desserts could put me in a food coma."}
{"text":"To be fair, I really loved IS SWEET during my first two visits but all my visits after that have ranged from decent to poor. From an aesthetic perspective, this place does have cute vibes. It has mismatched tables and chairs which you find at a lot of coffee shops nowadays. Also the place is nice and clean with big windows. 

The desserts I've had so far have been quite good. My personal favorite, the banoffee, is especially yummy. The crepe cake I loved when I first ordered it since I had never had anything like it, but at subsequent visits it's become less and less appealing to me personally. It tastes mostly like layered whip cream. The drinks are okay. My mango iced tea was delicious, but my coffee was extremely bitter even with cream and sugar.

One event that did ruin this place for me was when I checked their hours online and saw they would be open til 12 am. My boyfriend and I arrived there at 11 pm where we were greated by a sign on the front door that said \"New hours! Open til 1 am!\" So obviously, we were like \"great!\" and proceeded to attempt to place an order. The two male employees there made eye contact with us when we walked in, then proceeded to ignore us for a good two minutes while we waited to place our order. Finally, one of them acknowledged us and said, \"We're closing soon. The kitchen is closed.\" I was flabbergasted and thoroughly annoyed, not just that their hours were all over the place, but more so that they let us stand there for two minutes before telling us we wouldn't be served.

Honestly that experience has led me to go elsewhere to fulfill my sweet tooth cravings. Definitely overhyped."}
{"text":"Is sweet indeed. 

I seldom eat sweets and I could not resist. Three of us ordered different things. Honey toast with green tea ice cream, sizzling brownie.with ice cream and an frozen irish cream lattee with vanilla ice cream.

I asked if she could put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the frozen irish cream latte..and...you have to try it! Lol instead of whip cream, the vanilla ice cream melted into the drink and it was perfection.

The sizzling brownie and ice cream was mouthwatering. The perfect warm brownie allowing the vanilla ice cream to melt into it, was to die for. It was so rich in flavor. The dessert was perfect.

The honey toast with green tea ice cream was also on the dot. It was toasty on the outside and creamy soft condensed milk on the inside. The flavors all just blend together. 

If you have a sweet tooth, you cannot skip out on this place. Mind you, its not very big and it gets packed. They do have free wifi! 

Dont miss the turn to their parking lot and if the lot is full, park at the next plaza over and walk...its.worth the 2min walk haha."}
{"text":"Love the food presentation!!! Nice place to hang out with friends... Food and drinks Taste real good!!! They just need hire 1-2 more people to help out..."}
{"text":"Great location to relax and hang out with friends while enjoying a delicious slice of dessert! The cashier was very friendly and went into detail about popular items on the menu. I ordered a matcha green tea crepe cake ($6.50) and a vanilla latte ($4.65). 

The crepe cake arrived on a wooden board accompanied with a matcha sauce and a fresh strawberry on the side. It was delicious! The matcha isn't overpowering and the cake isn't too sweet. The filling was a light whipped cream that went well with the vanilla latte. 

Will be back with some friends!"}
{"text":"green tea crepe cake weeeeee! It's clean, bright & never crowded. It's tucked away in a little corner so its quiet & relaxing even in the middle of a busy complex right of spring mountain."}
{"text":"The honey toast was amazingly good! I'm glad we stopped in to try it. You can personalize it to certain flavors you like. I had a strawberry banana chocolate sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. Will stop by again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Every good thing you've ever heard about this place would be an understatement. The service is absolutely outstanding for being staffed by only 1 person. I've tried every tea and both crepe cakes that they sell and literally drool everyone I think about it! 

SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES AND COME BY!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get some really delicious drinks. They have an amazing varieties of drinks to choose from. We ordered five different types of drinks each of us sampled each other's drink. I like the mango flavored one the best. We also had a couple of desserts both tasted great."}
{"text":"Is Sweet is a sweet find! Hidden in Chinatown (across from SF market, just after ABC Auto) is a cute and clean spot for coffee and desserts. Menu includes espresso drinks, milk teas, and even smoothies. Desserts are limited but good quality, available for dine in or packed to go. 

The Strawberry smoothie was amazing, and the taro milk tea was flavorful and NOT gritty like other places. I did find it odd that there was no mention of boba on the menu. Tried a slice of cake that was quite good, it wasn't labelled but I believe they called it a coffee butter cake?

Staff is as sweet as the treats! If you can't find the location, call and they'll provide detailed directions. They have several special offers for their grand opening, including BOGO drinks (make sure to remind them, I was charged full price) and 30% off with social media check in."}
{"text":"Having bookmarked this place for the loooongest time, I finally stopped by today. However, my boyfriend and I only got the honey toast to share as we were full from dinner. Without a doubt, the honey toast was delicious..probably one of the best I've ever had. I thought the texture of the toast was spot on and adding ice cream complimented it very well. The portion size is big enough for two people to share, but I might have to get one all to myself next time...

Unfortunately, the price for the honey toast was not so sweet. $4 is not bad, but keep in mind, this is the base price for nothing on it. It's $1 extra for topping, $0.50 for sauce, and $1.25 for ice cream. Their base price should have at least included one or two free toppings or maybe even just ice cream...something is better than nothing. After adding some fruits and ice cream cream, our total ended up being $10!! Of course, we knew how much we were adding because we didn't want a plain honey toast. I think my eyeballs almost popped out of my eyes when I heard the shocking price. 

Conflicted about this place, but I will be back to try the drinks and other desserts."}
{"text":"I came 11:35 they didn't sell me anything :) because they closed cashier on 11:30pm. Yelp says close 12:00am


Amateur business. They just gave me \"sorry\" lol :)"}
{"text":"This place could quite possibly house my favorite cheesecake (not pictured.) I don't have anything negative to say. I love this place. I love their not overly sweet desserts. And I love how it's right next to Viet Noodle Bar. This little foodie corner has got it goin' on!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie and I don't know if it's because I'm a female Asian driver, but I got lost the first time I tried to come here... Buttttttt I made it and I love it!

Cute little spot in the corner with simple decorations. It's that type of cafe you see in KDramas with the cute chairs, plates and mugs. There is also a lot of room for everyone.. Unless there are campers that stays there for hours then I'm sorry. :(

I have the biggest sweet tooth in the world and this is my heaven.. Jk but comes close. :) I love the variety of combinations you can do with the honey toast and ice creams for a cheap deal! There is a 15minute wait for it but it's well worth it. I love the green tea crepe cake compared to the vanilla and red velvet because it's just the right amount of sweetness. And I always get the taro frappe with ice cream because I'm a taro lover. It never disappoints! 

Prices of the food here are great. To a simple coffee date to a full on dessert buffet, it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Highly recommend this dessert cafe for whenever you or your friends are in the mood for something sweet."}
{"text":"Being lived in Maryland surrounded by several Asian cafes, my expectation maybe a bit high. I was excited to learn that this place served Matcha crepe cake so I immediately ordered that upon arrival. 
The Matcha crepe cake was pretty tasty, but I felt that it could've had a stronger Matcha flavor. My friend ordered a latte and a NY cheesecake which she said was tasty. 

TIP: This caf√© is hidden, at the very end of the complex so don't be surprised if you get lost getting here. Just know it at the very edge so you look carefully."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely delicious. Efforts made by employees are wonderful. Honey toast, surpassed all expectations of what I imagined .. finely chopped fruits were all in season and just perfect. I would have rated it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Just average. Iced latte and creme brulee were good, but nothing special. Guy at the counter was very nice though."}
{"text":"Food is good. I really like their matcha cake and red velvet smoothie. I just wish the place was a tiny bit bigger. Sometimes there are too many people and no more place to sit."}
{"text":"They are pretty pricey for the quality of their desert. I had the matcha crepe cake and honeslty the only thing that made it \"matcha\" was a spoonful of sauce. The crepe was basically flour and cream. Nothing special about it and it was kinda expensive. The coffee was alright."}
{"text":"Been to this place plenty of times and every time I felt little disappointed. First, The staff could use little smiles to help bringing the place friendly environment and good customer service, especially the ones working night shift. Some of the staff are very rude to the customers which I don't understand why you would work at such a happy place like this and not even a smile to the customers. 
This time we went during the day- My friend ordered a crepe cake and it was dry .. I mean very dry.. especially on top layer. The picture I attached was right when they served us but it got a lot worse after few minutes. Guys, Please do not serve customer old cakes from the night before. Very very disappointed. I would have given 1 star if not because of the drinks are awesome and the display of the plates is always on point. 
I"}
{"text":"Will definitely be back for the other desserts. So far I've tried the green tea & red velvet crepe cake & they were wonderful!!! I love that it's not too sweet. My favorite though is the tiramisu. So decadent."}
{"text":"Craving for something sweet while we visit vegas. Boyfriend and I tried the green tea crepe cake, vanilla crepe cake, and brick toast. We weren't really a fan of the green tea crepe. But we did enjoy the vanilla crepe cake with a raspberry syrup on top. Brick toast was made fresh topped with vanilla ice cream. The brick toast was made to perfection. Great service."}
{"text":"The parking lot is a bit congested so if you're trying to find this place for the first time go to the furthest store on the left in the plaza. 
Ordered the matcha crepe cake with matcha ice cream. Friend ordered the creme br√ªl√©e. 
The cake itself wasn't too sweet and left a pasty feeling in the roof of your mouth. The sauce it came with made it 100% better, but they didn't give you much. The ice cream was delicious. Eating the cake alone, it was a bit disappointing despite the beautiful presentation. 
The creme br√ªl√©e was a bit heavy on the egg. Might just be my preference, but it wasn't the best one I've tried. 
If I visit again, it'd probably be to try the drinks rather than the desserts. Love the decorations inside, reminded me of a cafe in Korea. 
+ they have free wifi"}
{"text":"If you want a cute, intimate place to grab some dessert Is Sweet would be your best best! When I first arrived it wasn't busy, but about 10 minutes later the whole place was packed! So obviously they're well known for something! I had the vanilla crepe cake with strawberry sauce, and Peanut had the red velvet crepe cake with raspberry sauce. Vanilla crepe cake was good, it was even better with the strawberry sauce! It was a little over powering but it was good nonetheless! Peanuts red velvet crepe cake was good, but the raspberry sauce was not. It was extremely tart, and the pair did not mix well! Now red velvet with the chocolate sauce on the plate was definitely a hit! Again place is small, somewhat clean. We had to ask them to clear the table we sat at, but again they were packed and busy. They serve lemon water ! I didn't get to try any of the drinks, but from the reviews they must be good! Maybe if there's a next time I'll get something to drink. Didn't get a good picture of our desserts but I took one."}
{"text":"Dessert, dessert, dessert!!! The Honey Toast is delicious with whatever toppings you choose. The Condensed Milk is a must. The outside part is the best part because it has the touch of crispiness! Too bad that Las Vegas is too far too enjoy this dessert.  
The Chocolate Mousse on the other hand although the presentation was superb, was not as good. The cake was dry and chocolate covering was a bit hard. 
Will I come back to Is Sweet, of course!!!"}
{"text":"Literally my new favorite place. So cute. So cozy! And it's open late! And their pistachio latte gives me life!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to give this place five stars because you don't see many Japanese sweet places in Vegas. But alas, I wasn't thrilled with my matcha crepe cake. The texture was good however it tasted nothing like matcha. Not even the sauce at any type of matcha flavoring. On a good note the cake isn't very sweet. I got green tea ice cream to go with it and it was more sweet than green tea flavored. Both were yummy just not what I was expecting in a matcha flavor dessert. 

I plan on coming back to try the honey toast so hopefully I can update my review then. FYI if you order honey toast plan on a 15 minute wait as it takes that long to cook."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite dessert places in town. The employees greet you with a friendly smile the moment you enter the cafe shop. My server, Nadine, was very efficient and passionate with her job."}
{"text":"Super cute little dessert place! Great place to sit, have tea or coffee, with some cake or toast, with your friends!
The matcha crepe cake is unlike anything I've ever tasted and in the crepe world, this cake tops it all! With layers and layers of crepe, there's a heavy creme that holds it perfectly together! Top it off with a matcha sauce and a scoop of matcha ice cream creates a wonderful experience! I love it! There's also vanilla or red velvet!
I also had a pistachio hot drink and it was super tasty! Only in for the wintertime! 
You must try!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on reviews and I was not disappointed. The place is really charming and the lady at the counter was really nice and welcoming. I ordered the red velvet crepe and rose tea while the hub had the tiramisu and coffee. The hub also got a free ice cream because it was his birthday. The plating of the dessert was beautiful and I love the texture and flavor of the crepe cake. We will definitely come back'"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I come here all the time!!! Best Thai tea & honey-toast bread we've ever had. It's a little far from home but it is so worth the drive."}
{"text":"So good! Great service :) order the strawberry honey toast with vanilla ice cream and condensed milk. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! I absolutely loved this place! Great service and amazing desserts!"}
{"text":"This little store is too cute! I first came in here and i noticed there are giant windows on the side and that makes the place look like such a cute little cafe and the place is very clean. There are quite enough tables and chairs, and they have a menu with a variety of things. The most popular items are the green tea crepe cake, honey toasts with any toppings/ ice cream you'd like on it and there are frappes too! I tried the red velvet frappe and that was okay it tasted like a regular red velvet in a drink haha but the green tea crepe cake comes with green tea sauce and it was prettier than it tasted I guess, I mean it was still good though don't get me wrong! But I think the honey toast just beat ALL of it omg that was so delicious! I got a honey toast with a LoT of toppings, like probably Nutella mango bananas and almonds. Anyways the place is cute, the stuff is very sweet just like the name and it's nicely presented good job to the owners!"}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated and delicious freshly-made desserts. The people that work here are really nice. Coffee drinks aren't good but everything else is."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Hot n Juicy, and now looking to satisfy a sweet tooth. This place comes up as 4.5 stars and opens till midnight. The pictures all looked so good - we had to give it a try.  Uber dropped us off at the back of a strip mall and the place is a bit hidden. First impression is poorly decorated, 1980ish, coffee shop. Ordered their signature toast with two scoops of ice cream and a late.  The toast was literally just that drenched in sweetened condensed milk and sugar syrup.  It was topped with strawberries, blueberries, etc.  Two scoops of ice cream tasted like it came out of a bucket from Smart n Final. The coffee was just a little better than Starbucks.

This is a total kids hangout so dont expect Louie Bottega or Laduree. The sweets are ok kinda more like 86¬∞ meets Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Volcano was the summertime special that was like a chocolate milkshake with extra toppings. It was messy, but enjoyable. 

We also had the Honey Toast with strawberries, condensed milk, chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. Unfortunately we came after a big dinner, so we were extremely full, but the honey toast was enjoyable (better than Shokudo back home!)"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new dessert spot out, and the menu here was intriguing. It's tucked away in a little group of shops, but we found it ok.
 We tried the Red Velvet crepe cake(15 layers of crepes and whipped cream!) and the Honey toast with strawberries, whipped cream and some vanilla ice cream.
OMG.....this was the BOMB! Our new favorite treat! Definitely worth driving to from any spot in the valley!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I brought someone new to try the desserts and drinks out with me. Considering my two companions are not hardcore sweet fanatics but very hard to please, we all left blown away. 

It is hard to find the location cause it's tucked away in the corner of a plaza. But I liked that it was not too crowded with restaurants and parking was not tight either.

The first visit we my bff and I ordered four things: 
Lychee tea and mango tea: (so I wanted a tea with lemon and the only one on the menu like that was the Thai tea with lemon but I'm not a big fan of Thai tea.  I asked the guy at the register and he recommended the mango tea to me)
Both were sooo refreshing! She agreed the lychee drink was probably one of the best she's gotten. I got the mango and it wasn't exactly thick like filipino mango juice, not too tart and sweet. Both drinks didnt have that artificial syrupy sugary aftertaste some places that use syrup have. There were also small pulps  of fresh lychee and mango pieces in the bottom of our drinks! Both served ice cold too.

2/4 items ordered approved so far. Now moving onto dessert.

Green tea Mille crepe cake:
This was my first time ordering a crepe cake. I've had crepes before and I was expecting it to be a little heavy cause they are multiple layers of the crepe making up the crepe. Tasted the green tea sauce first which i think to be an anglaise. The green tea was creamy just like how i like it to be. Sometimes some places use green tea that have that jasmine taste but not in this case which i was relieved. The cake itself was melt in your mouth smooth and delicious. Perfectly well balanced, and again, had the right amount of sweetness. The matcha was subtle and not overpowering and the whipped creme wasn't super sweet either. Love love love. The sauce goes well with the cake and the accompanying fruits too.

3/4 items check! We held our breath for the final taste test to seal the deal--

Cheesecake: 
(So i asked the guy if the tiramisu was made with ladyfingers and marscapone cheese like it should be and he said yes. There's only one other place in vegas we've gotten tiramisu that was made right and wanted to try this one made at an Asian cafe for authenticity. Most places will try to use cream cheese or cake is why. So we ordered tiramisu with her drink cause we couldn't decide between the cheesecake and tiramisu. What arrived at our table was the cheesecake lol but we were so happy with our drinks we didn't catch on the mistake at first)
Anyways! the bite of cheesecake was legit I tell you. She agreed it tasted like real NY style cheesecake. Nice and firm, not overtly sugar laden and was creamy but not too too heavy. 

4/4 items check!

Halfway through the cheesecake we finally wondered what happened to the tiramisu. Realized he gave us the cheesecake instead. We were kind of full at this point but we were still interested in tasting it.
We went for the final stretch of approval. Would we get an authentic tasting tiramisu from an Asian cafe?? So we got it lol

Tiramisu:
And omg the first bite sealed the deal. The ladyfingers  in the bottom was soaked in the right amount of coffee liquor. Marscapone cheese was set correctly. Overall, I didn't think it possible but yep, the tiramisu certainly passed! It was a whopping 5/5!!
----
Second visit with the bf late at night we got the passion fruit tea, had him try the green tea crepe cake and a honey toast with just vanilla. 

He said the passion tea was amazing. I thought it was a little on the sweeter side but he said it was perfect. The honey toast he loved. He noted that it wasnt doused with honey like other places. The whipped creme was lightly sweetened and mellowed out the sweetness of the honey and ice cream. The crepe cake he complimented that it was no cake like he ever tried before and was astonished it was just layers of paper thin crepe and lightly sweetened creme.

Overall, yes it was another 3/3 approval from the both of us. Props for consistency!!

Service was great and the lady behind the counter was very friendly and answered our questions. She even let us know where they purchased all their cute serving utensils and dishware which are so cute I wish I could take them home lol. I will purchase them for  sure now that i know where to find them :p

Plus free wifi! Pw is posted near the register, I think it was \"sweetcoffee\" if memory serves correctly. 

Needless to say,  we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I come here a lot when I need a honey toast fix. Probably the best I've tasted in Las Vegas. People I bring here for the first time always come back and bring others."}
{"text":"One star for the adorable atmosphere and mellow pleasant music, one star for the cute and friendly servers, one star for the quality of desserts for the price, one star for the deliciousness of the sweets, and the final star for the overall experience that I definitely will be bringing more people to in the future! This was a perfect last-minute addition to our day after a wonderful lunch. This place is so cute and bright, it would be impossible to remain in a bad mood after stopping in here."}
{"text":"The employees were super nice and the interior was adorable! That said, I'm not hot on the location; I went late last night, and some of the people outside were a little sketchy. It was also my first time there, and I'm new to milk teas in general, so I think I made a bad choice (for my tastes) -- I ordered a taro milk tea, which was very sweet and just didn't appeal to me. But I'm sure some people would love it! The drink just wasn't my cup of tea.

But if I had longer to spend in Vegas, I'd for sure try again. I'm sure they have lots of stuff I would love."}
{"text":"I was looking for a high rated cafe in town & this one happened to be relatively close to me. From the moment I walked in I was so incredibly pleased with the set up of the establishment. It was so cute and just a comfy place to be in. The cashier and server were really helpful and sweet; the desserts was absolutely amazing. I ordered the honey bread with condensed milk, maple syrup & a scoop of ice cream. The honey bread was also fresh out of the oven, so the ice cream just slowly melted into the bread. I also had a mango slushee and it was tasty as well. I asked if they had boba, but sadly they don't ): despite my cravings for boba, this cafe is a definite must when visiting Chinatown!"}
{"text":"I haven't had much on the menu, but the Banoffee is amazing. I love the flavor and the texture and it was just the right amount of sweet, not overpowering like a lot of desserts you find these days. 

Went today to meet a friend. The tablss are a mix of regular height for dining and lower coffee table style. The seats are all different shapes and sizes as well, some hard some soft. It makes for an interesting array and decor. 

The space is a bit hard to find on your first visit. There wasn't a sign (that I saw) from the road and the store front does not face traffic. The parking lot is shared with multiple stores, but I haven't had any problems finding parking. 

I also had my 11 month old daughter with me. I did not see any high chairs and I couldn't hold her the entire time as she is too active with walking now. The staff and patrons did not seem to mind her walking around the cafe, so she explored some. It would have been nice to be able to put her in a seat for a bit, but it worked out anyway. 

The staff were very friendly and informative  (my friend had questions). It is definitely comfortable here and we hung out for a while never feeling rushed or in the way."}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews here, so i was really excited to try it out.  When I got there, I had a hard time trying to find something to order, so I settled on the red velvet crepe cake.  It looks and sounds special, but when it was time to taste it, it was not that special.  It tasted pretty ordinary.

I think I would come back and try to toast."}
{"text":"absolutely fantastic. cheesecake was delicious and I've never seen presentation like this for the price. lots of locals in the shop as well"}
{"text":"First thing you need to know, this gem turned up in our search for bubble tea, but they DO NOT serve bubble tea. IS SWEET specializes in refreshing flavored ice teas, lattes, and desserts. Even if you don't get your tapioca ball fix, this place is so worth checking out.

Here's why:
1. Friendly service
2. Lovely, whimsical setting with plenty of comfortable seating
3. Nice view of the mountains
4. Delicious iced teas, in flavors like green apple, served in mason jars
5. Tasty-looking desserts, like their matcha crepe (wish I got to try)

Whether you need a place to rest your feet, catch up with friends, study, or satisfy your sweet tooth, IS SWEET is a fantastic choice."}
{"text":"This place is a little ways from the strip but well worth the drive. The place is located in a small strip mall. It offers a few other items but make no mistake, this place is all about the \"honey toast\". They have other stuff like shakes, crepes, cake but you can get that pretty much at every Asian bakery. Honey Toast is basically a toasted square pound cake covered with your choice of toppings. One order is enough for 2 people to share. The ice cream placed inside helps to balance the sweetness. The Nutella and fruits on top adds more to your taste buds. This goes great with coffee, too. Doesn't my descriptions make you want to just drive there now?"}
{"text":"This is a cute little dessert and tea place. The desserts are very pretty, nicely decorated and delicious. The tea is nothing impressive, you can get better tea from an actual tea place. The parking lot is small since the place is in the very corner of a plaza, so parking can be difficult at times. Great service all times I have been there. Definitely recommend the layered crepe cake, all three flavors are delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for the ever-so-popular crepe cake. We got the matcha and red velvet one. I also got the rose tea. I was pretty disappointed with the rose tea. I was expecting more of a rose fragrance to it but it tasted like regular green tea. While the crepe cakes are definitely Instagram worthy, the taste was bland. There is a sauce (matcha for the matcha and raspberry for the red velvet) that you can either dip or pour over the cakes that gives it an extra flavor but without it, it's just alright. I haven't tried their other desserts but I wouldn't be opposed to it aka I'll give it another chance :)"}
{"text":"This place appears cute: Has a nice presentation with Asian-influence desserts and coffee drinks.  It's the same as many other spaces on the Spring Mountain stretch.

However.

Despite the fact that a group was having a meeting of 15-20 people there for a couple of hours every week or two weeks for about two months, with virtually everyone in the group buying a drink or dessert, we had a final meeting last week where we decided to go outside since the weather was nice and grabbed some metal chairs and brought them outside.  

The next thing we knew, the girl employee came outside and told us not to be too loud or they'd call the police.  

Wait, we've been steadily supporting you and purchasing your food/drink and you have the AUDACITY to threaten us when we're outside and being professional?  Wow.  

One of our members went inside and very politely reminded them we have been coming every week and purchasing things and we also brought VIP musicians from Japan.  They then said we could come inside and did not apologize, nor address us.  

I might also add I tried to talk to them politely later thanking them and complimenting them on the 2003 Kaskade house music they played but their customer service skills and communication skills are terrible and they either didn't understand or didn't care.  

We sat inside, ordered desserts and coffee and did our meeting but believe me - it's the last.  Never again.  We try to support the small businesses but next time we'll go to Starbucks or something more supportive.  So rude."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a restaurant to check it out. 
I got the matcha crepe cake. And omg is it amazing.
Presentation on point, taste on point. Decor and everything in here on point."}
{"text":"Small cute place. Desserts look and taste soooo good (instagram worthy wink wink)!

Staff are friendly.

Cool ambience...

Cakes are great. Drinks are okay... Not bad... But i had better ones."}
{"text":"Honestly I think this place is overrated. 
Price for a crepe cake is $6.50 for the have green tea, red velvet, and vanilla. 
However, I do really like their brick toast ($4) and additional toppings range from $1 to $1.25 each.
I think this is a cute place to go on dates and whatnot but I'll probably only be back for their toast."}
{"text":"This dessert coffee bar has a really cute atmosphere. Eclectic furniture, beautiful flooring and simplistic style. I felt out of place though close to the heart of Chinatown. There was a table of maybe high schoolers and they were taking pictures of me. Really awkward. 

But for the sweet treats I Liked the honey toast. The bread was fresh and well toasted. I ordered take away. When I got home they had not added all my toppings and they said I could come back and get one on the house. I also ordered the Matcha crepe cake. It was beautiful and green and not as sweet as a typical desert. I would say try it. I'm not a coffee drinker but there are also lots of tea and frappes."}
{"text":"employees, super nice and patient. we tried it for the first time on a whim last night. turned out to be a REALLY good find!

interior was really cute. very comfortable setting. perfect spot to hang out and chill. 

we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Is Sweet is a little dessert and drinks shop off strip! The decor was very cute with plush seating! I came here solely for their standard honey toast and for a Thai tea! 

The Thai tea was way too sweet and mediocre. As for the honey toast it was awesome - soft, not burnt and not overwhelmingly sweet. Keep in mind the wait for honey toast is 15 minutes as they do make it on spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great quiet spot to get work done or catch up with a friend. They have relaxing music and the ambiance Is Sweet and cozy. Each wall is painted a little differently, one painted as though it's an actual brick wall, also making it a great spot for selfies and pictures of your food lol. The menu has many different drinks ranging from mango tea, pistachio lattes, Nutella lattes, to yummy desserts that come beautifully decorated. I will definitely be coming back here and recommending others to do the same!"}
{"text":"Nice private corner had green Rose Tea and Crepe Cake both very good enjoyed the quite atmosphere and private location ."}
{"text":"We ordered the green tea crepe cake and the red velvet crepe cake -- The pictures looked so inviting, we couldn't resist! Yes, it was definitely insta worthy but that was pretty much it. I didn't really know what to expect but the cake itself didn't taste like anything. If I had my eyes closed I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the green tea and red velvet. It also came with a sauce but that didn't add any extra flavor to it. It did come with the ice cream which I liked, but I was hoping for more. I'm still glad I tried it though, but with all the dessert options around, I'm not sure that I'd come back."}
{"text":"Passion fruit iced tea was delicious, but it did not make up for the bad service. The cashier was not accommodating and because of that, we ended up not buying most of the items we wanted to. Very disappointed and I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"Called and asked specifically if they had marshmallows to go with hot chocolate. I get here, no marshmallows & the milk for the hot chocolate tasted like it had turned bad."}
{"text":"The honey toast was very good!!! And the cappuccino was an actual cappuccino not just a foamy latte. It's a little far for me but the good service worth the drive. I brought my mom and she wasn't happy with her original order but they switched it for her at no cost. They are super friendly cant wait to check out what else is on the menu."}
{"text":"Wanted to check it out for the crepe cakes. They actually make the mille crepe to order!! I did not see it on the menu, but if you ask they will probably have it. I prefer the green tea Mille crepe as it is less sweet than the vanilla crepe cake. The vanilla also has a weird after taste if you don't put the raspberry sauce. 

Place is difficult to find, but thanks to the reviews my friend and I were able to find it. Literally turn right after you pass the plaza \"Cazino\" is in. I thought cazino was a typo of casino, but there is actually a place called cazino. HAHA."}
{"text":"This is a cute, late night place to chill for some desserts. Honey toast with any toppings is yummy. I personally got the honey toast with green tea ice cream. Don't forget the strawberries and condensed milk!"}
{"text":"This place took so long, I'm still here. The toast is mediocre at best and the drinks are good. But 45 minutes at 6pm on a Tuesday? We ordered 3 drinks and 2 honey toasts and were the second customers. I don't think I would come back for this place unless a friend made me."}
{"text":"I saw their beautiful crepe cakes on Yelp and could not wait to try it. Well...gotta be honest it is not something that I expected. The cream that they use seems like just a whipped cream, nothing else, not sweet, pretty fat. Crepes by itself just tasteless.
It's served with some strawberry jam and you also can add big scoop of ice cream for $1,5.
Ice cream makes it better (and sweeter)! 

Place is pretty small and Saturday night it was very busy. 

If you are here for good-looking crepe cake, You better take a classic - cheesecake! It's extremely good!!! Coffee is excellent"}
{"text":"Good but over price and they don't have few on menu nice cool place go back again try. Other item."}
{"text":"Went out for a treat with my kids and sister and did not disappoint.
If you want something that tastes as good as it looks, you've found the place.
We tried the Honey Toast with Vanilla Ice Cream and Strawberries, Vanilla Cr√™pe Cake with Strawberry Ice Cream, a Pistachio (non coffee) latte, and a Taro (non coffee) latte.
Loved the Pistacchio"}
{"text":"Matcha crepe cake was just ok, honey toast was good. I'm a cappuccino lover but I hated theirs.  Don't think I'm coming back again:("}
{"text":"I wish I had better Instagram skills, because these desserts are so so cute, they could make me Insta famous. Everything from the chocolate milkshake, to the crepe cakes, to the honey toast was made with such impeccable presentation. The crepe cakes came with large spoon of sauce to pour over. The strawberry cake had a cute Hello Kitty chocolate and Pocky Sticks on it. The milkshake was oozing with fudge. Everything was perfect. 

The space was clean and there was enough seating for my family of 10. We had a great time sharing the shmorgishborg of desserts! The strawberryhoney toast was by far my favorite, and it was better than any honey toast I had ever eaten. The toast had a sweet flavor and doughy texture, while still keeping a sticky crisp on the outside. The strawberries were very fresh and sweet, and the ice cream provided a perfect balance to all of the flavors. The banana cream pie thing we had (I didn't order so I don't know what it's called!) was my second favorite. I had to have a lot of self control not to eat it all before my family could try it.  The green tea crepe cake had a subtle flavor and in my opinion, was not nearly as yummy as it looked. Same with the chocolate and strawberry cakes. I really enjoyed the Nutella Latte and Taro Latte. 

Overall, it was a fun place to go with my family. There is something for everyone, and it is a good social environment."}
{"text":"Delicious, just delicious. Had the honey toast with fresh strawberries, condensed milk and ice cream. The toast was perfect, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. The condensed milk was just sweet enough with the strawberries and ice cream. A really satisfying bite. 
The red velvet crepe cake was really nice, great texture and not too sweet. With the fruit jam and chocolate sauce underneath, it was also really good.
Finally the sesame milk tea had a really strong, fresh sesame taste.
The atmosphere was so relaxing and so chill. I could just sit here for hours. 
All in all a great experience tonight."}
{"text":"Phenomenal desserts, tired of the run of the mill restaurant desserts? Check this place out! We had the honey toast, and a slushie. Both were amazing can't wait to try the others, although I may have found the best they have. So good!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, cakes, sweat. Would come back again next time in town.

Everything we ordered was perfect, service was great too."}
{"text":"In all honesty the green matcha green tea crepe was good. However, the service was slow and needs improvement in cleaning up. After paying for our order it was difficult to find a table that wasn't occupied with used plates and cups. I don't know if this restaurant was short of staff, but there was no line of customers at the cashier and nobody was clearing out the tables. I had to ask the cashier if do we wait for her to clear the tables or how are we going to this... After the table was cleared there were food crumbs left on the surface which was very disturbing when we lean our arms on the table. Bad service just being honest!"}
{"text":"What drew me here was the rest velvet crepe cake. I had always seen them but never got a chance to try one. I felt like crepes one night turned to my trusted yelp for suggestions and viola found this spot.

Its a cute trendy place for coffee and dessert. Quiet and private for a gathering with friends or family. Only con I can see is the place is in the back of a small, not well lite plaza so it is a bit hard to find. 

I definitely want to try the match crepe cake so I'll be back. The red velvet one was delicious! Not too creamy so the layers of crepes didn't fall apart which is what I was expecting. We also had the honey toast with strawberries and almond slices. Honey toast was sweet but not overpowering."}
{"text":"A cute small place to get a drink in a cute mason jar, also has yummy treats to eat with your drinks. 
Me and my girl friend like to come here when we need to chit chat. We've been here a couple of times, and the gentleman that works here remembers us and our \"cute kids\". 
They offer complimentary lemon water, and looks like hot tea as well? 
A couple tables, looks like there's one large table for a big group. They have FREE wifi and nice music. 
The only dessert I tried was the green tea crepe, with green tea drizzle sauce, and fresh berries ( very light, not overly sweet - just right ). 
Me and my friend will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, I tried the strawberry cheesecake and a cake done of 16 crepes of green tea!!! It was just a piece of heaven!!! Te crepes were so thin but solids!!! Real desserts"}
{"text":"Amazing place here, I really recommend crepe cake, creme br√ªl√©e, and honey toast!!! The restaurant is very cute and top it off with friendly service."}
{"text":"Not the fastest service but the quality and style of the place makes you forget your in Vegas.

Both the waffles and honey toast were great and tasty desserts.  I would recommend if your in the mood for a chill coffee and fresh desserts.  Also looks like a great spot to get some studying done."}
{"text":"After an evening out with some friends, we were looking for a sweet way to end the night...someone suggested Is Sweet, and I'm so glad they did! 

Tucked away in an awkwardly arranged strip mall (like most gems in Chinatown), Is Sweet is a cute little coffee shop with desserts and obviously coffee and tea beverages. It's open fairly late, which was a major selling point for us. 

One friend had been here already, and suggested the honey toast...since I was a honey toast virgin, I trusted her recommendation and she did not steer me wrong. I asked the guy took our order how he liked his honey toast, and he suggested vanilla ice cream, strawberries, banana, and condensed milk...okay, why not? 

My friends ordered different flavors of crepe cake--the matcha, the vanilla, and the red velvet. We created a nice little tasting table for ourselves. 

I was very happy with the honey toast - the fruit was the perfect addition, with little bursts of tart strawberry. I wasn't as big of fan of the crepe cakes as I thought I would be, the vanilla was my favorite though. My honey toast was the clear winner, as the four of us demolished it.  

Great place to grab dessert and have a conversation with friends or a date. I would definitely return, and provably try the mango honey toast next time, or the shave ice."}
{"text":"The matcha mille crepes were so good! It was topped with the matcha green syrup sauce. Opens late which is another plus! I'll be back if I'm ever in Vegas again, they need more of these dessert places in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"The dishes is well prepared and people are so nice in here it is kinda sad they only opened until 9pm, we ordered matcha Mille crepe cake it's really light and strong matcha flavor! You will regret it if you didn't try that one !"}
{"text":"I loved the desert here! I keep bringing in different family members as they visit me here in vegas! It's duh a cute spot to enjoy coffee and catch up for the day! Try the honey bread it's amazing with Nutella strawberries and condense milk. A must!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Love the desserts and coffee here :) the owners are so kind and their coffee never disappoints. I recommend this place to any coffee lovers out there ;)"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for a while and finally was able to try it.  Definitely a cafe vibe, warm and cozy. I came here on a Sunday and surprisingly it was not crowded! I started by getting a Matcha Green Tea cake, it's a layered crepe cake with your choice to get ice cream, so I had a scoop of chocolate ice cream on the side. I enjoyed it, but what really got my tastes buds moving was the honey toast. You add your own toppings on it but depending what topping you want will effect the overall price. So for us (my sister, hubby and I) we ate it with peanut butter, Nutella, banana, strawberry maple syrup and a scoop of ice cream! I can't remember the last item I ordered but I think it was something off the lines of a Volcano! It wasn't in the menu but there was a picture of it that caught my eye. It's basically chocolate milk with cool whip and chocolate shavings. I probably would only get that again if I was craving milk."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this place because of the good reviews and the pictures that I have seen but I am disappointed. The service  very poor, I told the lady at the register that it was my first time there and she couldn't care less. I was expecting at least for a recommendation about what is popular to eat in that place. She was just there waiting for me to order.( Again it was the first time) I got the honey toast with nutella, banana, and strawberries it was good but nothing special! The place looks very clean and cozy tho."}
{"text":"Hi everyone!
(This review is mostly experience based & a little about taste)
   So me and some friends finished dinner at the Viet pho place next door to 'is sweet'. We walked over at 11:30 pm, into the 'is sweet' doors at 11:34pm. The close sign said midnight, we arrived nearly 30 minutes before closing. The cashier had already blocked off the register with chairs. When we asked if we could order, they said last call is at 11:30. Last call? Lol I'm at a club/bar? Hahaha! 
   Now I may be wrong, I doubt it. If your business has operating hours till a set time, wouldn't you fully operate till that time??!! If a bank closes at 5pm, does the teller tell you, we stop taking/cashing checks at 4:30. Even restaurants that I've been to from pizza to dessert bars. They never turn down a group of customers. That's your money now and your rating later. 
   I was already 50/50 on if I liked 'is sweet' or 'the patio' better. We were going to give both places one more try before deciding. This just made it a landslide of a win for 'the patio'. If you haven't tried the patio, definitely give there waffle toast and ice cream a shot. Something 'is sweet' doesn't have!"}
{"text":"I've tried IS Sweet twice now and definitely recommend it for anyone looking for desserts! The first time I came here I just wanted drinks and wasn't that impressed with that alone-- they specialize in desserts, so desserts you should get!

My friends and I tried the the Green Tea Mille Crepe Cake, Red Velvet Mille Crepe Cake, Honey Toast, and Nutella Mousse Cake. These desserts were all good but our definite favorites were the Green Tea Crepe Cake and Honey Toast-- you can't go wrong with your choices! 

I love that this place is very intimate and the decor is \"sweet\".. it's good for dates or small groups. The location is bit hidden in the back area of a small shopping complex, so pay close attention to the maps if it's your first time visiting.

Overall Review: ENJOY! :)"}
{"text":"We found this place on accident, and it was so worth it! Honey toast was on point (and customizable!), crepe cakes were soft and not sickeningly sweet, and the slushies were just flat out delicious. Definitely taking all my sweet toothed friends next time!"}
{"text":"Gotta try this new spot! They have nice desert sweets, smoothies, coffee, and a view. This place is on a small hill. That you can overlook the view of the strip and also a mountain. Well I like it in overall."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Matcha green tea crepe cake flavor is not great. A pot of tea with 1 tea bag was flavorless. Not worth the stop in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite cafe/coffee shop in Las Vegas. I probably come here two or three times a month lol. But the desserts are to die for, the beverages delish, the atmosphere is beautiful (literally spend hours in here) and not the mention the staff are always so wonderful and sweet! Could it honestly get any better than that! I would say reasonable prices all around, and you honestly get what you pay for. 10/10 guys!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dessert place in town. 
It was in the corner of a plaza, which is a little bit hard to discover.
The environment is quite and chill; I like to sit here with my laptop and enjoy myself during my day off.

Drink: Iced tea with lychee is my favorite, it tastes fresh and sweet.
Dessert: they have the best honey toast in town, it is little pricey, but I think it worth the price. The green tea crepe cake is very good in here too; they will give you extra green tea sauce and green tea powder on top of the cake.

Overall: Nice place for tea time and chill with your friend."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to go in Chinatown. Whenever I come, there's always this one guy by himself who serves and does everything by himself. Guy, you are the real mvp. Sometimes there's a wait for food/drinks but it's damn worth it. I have yet to be disappointed. My first time, me and my boyfriend ordered an iced coffee with caramel and the green tea crepe cake with ice cream. I loved all the layers in the cake. Had the perfect whip cream ratio and the sauce they provide with it, was amazing. The Honey Toast is a must as well, I ordered another one to go before I left! I'll come back for more"}
{"text":"The interior is so cute! They also have a water station for free. There isn't a lot of space for big groups unfortunately. I wasn't sure if there was outside seating either. Our cashier was so nice and knowledgeable. 

The honey toast is unbelievable!!! The outside has the perfect crisp and with the ice cream it goes so well together. The inside of the honey toast is sooo good it's addicting. I wish I had this where I was from. I was really impressed with it!"}
{"text":"this hidden gem on spring mountain has the BEST matcha crepe cakes I've had by far here in Vegas.  it's a quaint little cafe hidden along spring mountain.  they do offer various other desserts as well as teas and coffee beverages."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, good music, good food, highly recommend! Staff is nice, not to be typical but aesthetic af"}
{"text":"My favorite dessert place. For a while it was a little hidden gem. I've been coming here for years for the green tea crepe. The dessert is always tasty and most of all picture perfect. Must try!"}
{"text":"Tired the green tea crepe cake, horrible, it wasn't sweet at all, only by the looks of it was green tea no taste of it, the vanilla ice cream that came with it was a very cheap one. This place was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Everyone was really nice here since we got here. So I gave them 3 stars because their layered crepe cake (green tea) was not good at all and we got a refund on a chocolate cake my partner ordered :(. I also ordered a Taro Frap and that was pretty good.

Overall drinks are good, deserts not so much.."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some dessert, so my husband and I decided to try this spot based on yelp reviews. The shop is clean and cute, romantic decor. We ordered green tea crepe, ice cream, creme brulee and hot coffee with banana syrup. Everything was delicious. I never drink black coffee but i was very pleasantly surprised how good it was here. Will come back."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is so delicious!!!  It's a pretty small place, but worth it. The honey toast is to die for. Everyone is super nice. We come here often."}
{"text":"I am a huge green tea fan so when I got the email for the Matcha in Vegas locations I had to go and give this place a try. The directions to the place are awful but look for the signs on Spring Mt. It's in the same little plaza where Pho Hung is, but towards the back. 
We bought 3 crepe cakes and they were top notch. A little pricey but considering the amount of work that goes into them it's okay."}
{"text":"So, I was hoping this place would stand out based on the pictures on yelp. I honestly came for the little bear dessert, but they didn't have it available. So, I'm assuming it's a limited type thing. Bummer.

I got the match green tea latte, raspberry leaf decaf hot tea for my friend, a matcha crepe cake, and a tiramisu. Wait wasn't long for to go, and I should've kept the receipt on my first bout because my tiramisu order was missed. I guess I was inattentive to notice that he didn't mention it to me when he repeated my order back.

Anyway, the stuff here was okay and not really worthwhile, I'm sad to say. There several cafes in this city, and I thought the cute aspects of the food would pull me here. Maybe it's cause I ordered to go or was expecting a more exciting menu selection as far as their sweets go, but I feel like the only draw to this place is that it's open fairly late for a place that serves desserts. Though it's true, for a higher price point, you COULD just go to Sweets Raku down the street.

Anyway, if you find yourself looking for a cafe to have coffee and maybe a random sweet bite to eat, come here. But don't expect too much, or you might be disappointed.

Thank you for the experience."}
{"text":"Is Sweet was definitely a pleasurable experience. I got the honey toast with my friends and it was such a delicious treat that we had to get another one right after. 

If you're in the area, stop by and satisfy your sweet tooth! The atmosphere and service was superb too so I have no complaints with them! 

I plan on coming back again in the future and expanding my tastes through their menu."}
{"text":"Came in and purchased a couple coffees the crepe cake and the honey toast which were all equally delicious. My only dillema through all this was how pricey this came out to. Will come back again but may be  a while due to the priceness"}
{"text":"Honestly decided to check this place out because of all this Instagram hype I've been seeing for a couple years now. Definitely has a very cute, quaint, and sweet little cafe feel. Very kawaii. I got the tiramisu cake, which was served on a hip wooden cutting board-like plate (please don't smite me if there's an actual term for it, which I'm sure there is). It was pretty late at night at this point, so I'd give the cake 2.5 stars. It was alright. The atmosphere was nice though, I'll have to come back during the day to try another dessert and some coffee. If you're looking for an aesthetically pleasing instagram photo, though, this is your place to go."}
{"text":"Is Sweet is pretty sweet, cute, relaxing, and chill.

Tucked a few spaces down from a Pho establishment is this cute little cafe that looks like most cafes I've seen in Asia. 

A small dessert menu with a few items available only on specific days pairs well with their extensive drink menu. 

To the far right of the counter are the desserts consisting of NY cheesecakes, tiramisu, coffee cake and creme brulee...which I found oddly placed at the end hidden by a few tables and chairs. 
Usually when you have pastries, you would want it to be one of the first things your consumer sees and not the last. 

On this particular visit, our order consisted of a vanilla crepe cake, tiramisu, creme brulee, thai lemon tea, kiwi tea and a mango tea. The cake was pretty good, as well as the tiramisu.  The creme brulee fell short on the texture as it was close to being runny and grainy. 
The tea however was the best part of the entire visit. The thai lemon iced tea was great and I could literally order gallons of this for summer. 

We arrived around 930-945pm and they had already sold out of the green tea crepe cake. They close at midnight,  so I would just assume they would have enough to last till closing...

The vibe was pretty chill, and the staff was outgoing and friendly."}
{"text":"The brick toast here is a must! As a huge lover of sweets, this place is probably the best brick toast I have ever had. The toast was soft, chewy and covered with honey. I added a scoop of green tea ice cream, mango, banana, strawberries and condensed milk drizzle. This was the perfect combination of my favorite fruits and flavors. The toast was a bit difficult to eat because the pieces were not separated at the bottom but the dish came with knives so you must put in some work for the goods.
I'd pass on the  strawberry fruit smoothie next time. It didn't come in a mason jar as the pictures on yelp shows. Instead it came in a plastic to-go cup. The flavor was mediocre, nothing special. Save your money."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good ! I would say the only thing I dislike about the place, is the location. It was really hard for me to find on the GPS and it was hidden way back behind the complex, I also don't believe that you could see the sign very well either, other than that downfall.. it is really a hidden gem. This place is right next to a new Pho restaurant that just opened up! If that helps anyone! 

When I walked in with my friend, it was a cute little shop. It felt cozy and welcoming. The different tables and chairs made me at home. The people there are friendly and give you when you walk in and if you have any questions about the menu, they will gladly answer it! After looking this place up and reading some other yelp reviews, I decided on the honey toast and the crepe cake. I honestly couldn't decide between the two, so I got both! Haha. We ordered the food and decided to sit outside. They have two tables in the corner overlooking some apartment complexes, the view was okay. Nothing special, we just enjoyed the weather! 

They brought the desserts outside to us and they were presented so sweetly! They looked so appealing on the plate, you didn't want to touch the work of art! The crepe cake came with some raspberry sauce and orange slices, I like the fact that you can pour as little or as much raspberry sauce on your crepe cake. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was almost melt in your mouth. It was good! My friend ordered the green tea crepe, and he enjoyed it just as much as well. The honey toast came out a little later than the crepe cakes, but that was okay because when it came out it was warm and smelled heavenly. It was worth the wait. I love how sweet it was, it was the perfect combination of toast and honey. I added strawberries to mine, so the strawberries balanced the sweetness of the honey. I didn't add any ice cream because I thought it would be a little too much. So getting the honey toast with the strawberries was perfect for me! Writing this is making my mouth water! Haha, I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We love this place ! A must go every time we are in town ! The honey toast is AMAZING! Love , love , love it !!!! Anything your order , you can't go wrong ! Everything looks so pretty and taste just as good ! Coffee is great as w"}
{"text":"I think people only like this place because of aesthetics. It's a really cute place to Instagram and whatnot but other than that, I think this place is way overpriced for what it is. I've been here three times or so and the ONLY thing I like here is the honey toast. The crepe cake is gross and dry and $6 like what?? I could buy six instant ramens with $6! Or buy a shirt on sale! The chocolate cake tasted like it was three days old and it was also 80% frosting. The drinks here are overwatered and to be honest, I'm just really not a fan. The people here are nice though and it is a cute place is take pictures. To be honest, I feel like that's the reason why most people go there"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Thursday night! It wasn't busy at all when I came in but like 10-15 minutes after I sat down, more people are coming in. Dang, I guess this place is really a good spot. I ordered their House Iced Coffee and of course, their MATCHA/ GREEN TEA CREPE CAKE. Better try that one or else you'll missing the good part of this place! It was so freaking delicious, it wasn't even sweet or bitter! 

Note: This place is hidden from the same plaza where Viet Noodle Bar at. I got lost a couple of times because Siri gave me wrong directions. LOL. Good thing I called them and finally found them! 


All in all, the iced coffee was good! The matcha crepe cake was bomb! Men in front were pretty nice to give me directions to come here! Seems this place will be one of the places that I will go often!"}
{"text":"This place IS SWEET! Cutesy decor, short (but sweet) drink menu, desserts galore - perfect for those of us with sweet teeth! How could we not love this place? 

After reviewing the menu and having the owners give us some helpful tips, my fianc√© and I decided on the matcha (green tea) frappe and the honeydew frappe. We also scored with the 30% yelp check-in offer. The frapp√© is slightly thicker than a slushy but smoother and lighter than a smoothie. First sips we were fans! Great, strong honeydew and matcha flavor. They had the perfect balance; not too icy or watered down and not obnoxiously sweet. They were perfect! They actually really reminded us of ice cream we would use to buy from the Asian market - very yummy and refreshing. I can definitely see us returning soon and many times when the desert summer heat hits.

Note: I'm comparing the matcha frappe here to the Madhouse Coffee's \"matcha green tea smoothie\" and also the \"matcha ice blended\" from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf - their frappe version here stands up to those top competitors! A lovely and much cheaper version indeed.

We also tried the creme br√ªl√©e and it was torched with just the right amount of sugar, again not overly sweet, just right! They topped it with perfectly ripened berries and we savored every bite. I loved the creamy, custardy consistency - not to mention the serving size was decadent and perfect for two.

We saw other mini desserts and cakes that they make in-house; yup, tiramisu was spotted amongst a fruit cream cake, coffee buttercream cake, green tea crepe-like cake, and a few others. (The only dessert not prepared in-house was their New York Cheesecake.)

The prices are great! $4.55 for a large size (24 oz.) Plus they are doing a yelp check-in offer which is 30% off any order, or you can jump on their grand opening special - BOGO 50%. Pretty sweet deals. 

The owners are Thai (a brother & sister duo) and they are so super sweet. They were very attentive and really shined in customer service. They offered to correct our drinks if for any reason we weren't happy with them - the gesture is appreciated, but we didn't even need them fixed. We really enjoyed our drinks!

They are really cute here! We wish them the best of luck in this new venture."}
{"text":"Cute little dessert/coffee shop!   We came here after eating sushi and wanted dessert.   My daughter ordered the strawberry cake, which had a chocolate Hello Kitty on it.   That cake was delicious!  Myself I wanted to try the matcha crepe cake, again this was very light and not too sweet!   
For sure will be back again!"}
{"text":"Dessert is great! 
Cute little coffee shop + cakes
Wont regret coming here !!!
I just wish my stomach was bigger for more"}
{"text":"I wanted to escape my family, so my friends took me to this cute little place. We got honey toast with vanilla ice cream, nutella, and bananas. It was so good, we inhaled it in less than five minutes and ordered another one."}
{"text":"Even after being blown up full from eating a soulful large bowl of Oxtail Pho from Viet Noodle Bar, I was still curious to try this dessert place. I lured my parents to check it out too by saying.. we have to walk this pho out and walked right into IS SWEET ;) 

Hiding at the corner, this place is at the very end of the business complex. Mind you, do Not park under the covered parking structure. Or you'll get your car towed! I feel the businesses around this area has picked up exceedingly well from having Viet Noodle Bar open at this location. It works in both favors.. eat some delicious Vietnamese cuisine and then walk a few stores down.. Bam. You got yourself a place for after dinner non-alcoholic drinks and at the same time.. satisfy your sweet tooth ;) The best of both worlds for foodie lovers!!!

I, somewhat lost interest in trying this place, since a coworker told me it was just O-K. Damn I should've just went and tried it myself before dismissing it as the atmosphere is oh so cozy and nice! It was so wonderful. I was admiring the festive decoration they've done for Halloween ;) That's the spirit! I like that about local businesses that are open to do those things that make it fun and welcoming to the guests. It made me smile looking around.. those hanging skulls, bats upside down, skeletons on the windows, spider webs, and mummified skeleton got me in the mood to spook someone.. maybe with my silly laugh that my brother says is something else :P Hehe, keke, haha, hoho.. wait that's for Christmas!

The kind lady that helped me was patient and kind with answering all my questions on what's good here. I looked up and Thai Lemon Tea caught my eyes. My mom was eyeing the creme brulee, so we got those to try. You know when you drink or eat something and that flavor hits you on the first sip or bite and you have this animated cartoon look where your eyes become hearts popping out?! Yeah... my Mom and I had that moment. That Thai Lemon Tea got me. Grabbed my heart and ran kind of feeling. Remarkably refreshing. The hints of sweetness from the Thai Tea followed with sourness of the acidity from the lemon. It's like your favorite candy.. This would be for all the Sour Patch Kids Lovers.. but as a drink! I can seriously become an addict of this one. I slurped this up in F1 racing speed and I was instantly yearning for more. I'm even thinking about it right now as I write this review! Someone save me!!! Heroes! Batman, Superman, Voltron, Optimus Prime!!!??! Help me.. I need this driiiiiink! *with my hands reaching the sky.....Is anyone there?!

Creme Brulee.. one word.. LOVE. Strikingly gratifying. That custard-like creme that just melts on your tongue. Oh... . I'm lost for words. Give me a moment.... ....... ........................... ......... . Not overpoweringly sweet nor lacking of it. It's just a masterpiece. You can't go wrong with this dessert. No way, no how. There's some magic in this. I swear I took one bite and I was in happy land paradise. The sun was shining and a rainbow of color lit my palate. Let me tell you how good this dessert was... I can close my eyes and sleep with a smile :) Get some.

I'm going to stop by after work more often to this place when I just need that dessert fix I can't get from anywhere else. And to be open seven days of week til the strike of midnight?! I heart this place to the moon and back and back again I go!!! Love."}
{"text":"The location was hard to find. Took about half an hour circling to actually find it. The place was very cute. We were looking for their famous \"crepes\" but we couldnt find it on the menu turned out that they have it on a separate menu. They have other kawaii food as well. The food took us 10-15 mins. We ordered Thai tea, taro milk tea,and waffle topped with whipped cream, almond sliced, nutella and vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I love their sweets and drinks here! I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it already. I always get their crepe cake (any flavor!) and they usually have a \"seasonal\" flavor. The owners have told me they make all the sweets in house! It's amazingly delicious!

I've tried a lot of their iced teas. Not too sweet, not too strong, very aromatic, just the way I like it. Customer service is A+++! Very nice and friendly. They patiently wait for us to scan through their variety of offerings. 

Overall, very highly recommended! Nice atmosphere to hang out with friends and get some good sweets and treats!"}
{"text":"very nice dining environment and friendly services. I tried three different kinds of dessert, all of them are so good and not too sweet"}
{"text":"Reasonable priced desserts for their portions and the specialty white chocolate drink is to die for. The only down side is not much space, it's a little hard to find a table available on a busier day."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I have to stop by. Today I try Melted cheese cake so delicious"}
{"text":"Best place to have a casual meeting and get work done! Staff is kind and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the mango tea with a nice matcha crepe. Every single time i order it someone has their own style of decorating it. I love that. And the honey bread is heaven. A great size to share. I order the honey bread with nutella,vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Looking forward to trying something new next time."}
{"text":"Found this gem earlier on this year and so far, I've been here 3 times!
Super cute cafe and it's also placed in a hidden location, so the first time I tried finding this place in chinatown it was a hassle but nonetheless, worth finding!

The first time we went, we had the banoffee cake and the matcha crepe cake. For drinks, we had the pistachio latte (my sister's favorite, she always gets it when we go now) and I got the cold brew with a splash of soy milk. What I love the most about this place is the atmosphere of this establishment and the decor matches up with the display of the desserts (both super cute!).

The second time we went, we got the honey toast with matcha ice cream and whipped cream on top with peanut butter. It wasn't all that, still preferred the banoffee cake the most! This time I tried their lychee iced tea and it was super delicious & refreshing!

The last time we went, we took one of our friends with us and she was super impressed with how the cafe looked and was surprised the items on the menu tasted delicious. We got a coffee crumble cake (we were curious, but after taking a bite out of it... it wasn't delicious at all... we ended up throwing it away..), coconut cream cake, and the tiramisu (SO BOMBS!). For drinks, we ordered the Sesame Milk Tea, Pistachio Latte and  Lychee Iced Tea.

Although I've noticed that the crepe cakes and honey toast are the most popular dessert items, I would stick with the other desserts. The banoffee cake and the tiramisu are definitely the best ones on the menu in my opinion."}
{"text":"We wanted to find a good dessert place and I think we've found it! This gem is small but the desserts are huge in flavors! They also sell coffee and tea, but we were definitely there for the crepe cakes. We also had the ice cream bowl which comes with 3 scoops of ice cream and we had the strawberry cake. The next time we go, we'll try the honey toasts."}
{"text":"Cute little place without a lot of seating. Cake in at 9pm and it was packed. A heads up they do run out of ice cream so be aware. Ordered the crepe cake with a scoop of ice cream. Got the red velvet with Raspberry sauce and green tea ice cream. Sounds a little off but the flavors are subtle and not too sweet so they blend well. Great place to hang out and enjoy some yummy desserts in Vegas"}
{"text":"I LUV THE ATMOSPHERE! This is a great place to take those aesthetic photos for Instagram but the actual taste is not as hype as it looks.  The only problem I experienced was having a light bulb from another boba place ( which I can lowkey understand) and I couldn't buy a single scoop ice cream with an espresso in order to recreate an affogato because it was also against store policy. 

We got the popular matcha green tea, and the strawberry one too, the honey toast ( IT WAS SO GOOD FORGOT TO TAKE A PICTURE BEGORE IT DISAPPEARED IN MY STOMACH), summer special chocolate volcano (tastes cold, refreshing, but very sweet) and some others I can't remember from yesterday"}
{"text":"The shop was nice and so were the workers, we got the matcha cr√™pe cake it was so pretty but not tasty. I couldn't eat it, but that's just me don't knock it till you try it!"}
{"text":"Very cute place! Yes, this shop is kind of hidden.. But the flags they have out front that advertise this business helps a lot. 

My first visit here I showed up at around 20 minutes after they had opened. I was expecting to try their green tea crepe cake but the only choices they had that were ready was the coffee cake, and the melted cheesecake. Not quite sure if it's a limited choice every morning.. But I ended up getting the coffee cake. As far as the drinks, there are so many choices to choose from! Coffee, tea, and smoothies! I decided to go with the iced white mocha. 

The icing (which was actually butter cream) on coffee cake was pretty hard to eat at first because it  came straight from the fridge. It didn't really taste that good at first. 
I'm no pastry chef or a baker or anything... So I didn't know I had to wait till the cake wasn't so cold so the butter cream would soften up (the lady who took my order had explained that after I took a few bites from the cake). And man.. It tasted waaay better. Was not disappointed with the cake after that! 

The white mocha. I usually try to avoid ordering a white mocha because a lot of times it comes out too sweet. But! It just sounded delicious at the time so I got it! :D This drink was well balanced and had just the right amount of sweet. I enjoyed it very much! 

Most of their tables seat up to like 3 people. But there is one table I saw that can seat up to I think it was 6.. If you like meeting up with a couple friends/fam & talking over some dessert and drinks, this is a good place for that :)"}
{"text":"Another great find thanks to Yelp! Hot and new in Vegas, they are making some of the best coffee around! With an extensive, unique menu and mention of a secret menu as well as making you anything you can dream of, your options here are endless! The service here is stellar, really exceptional, we got blended coffees for my husband and I as well as a birthday cake one for my son. Prices are fair, coffee came out quickly and was perfect!
Drive thru and walk up only, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a dark chocolate cold drink n the server got it cold and got me a hot drink. She looked pissed when I said I ordered a cold drink, she went to change it to a cold one and did not even apologize for her mistake! Omg so rude, worst service ever!"}
{"text":"got place for desserts while in Vegas, visited twice and they take pride and preparing each food"}
{"text":"The people who work here are very friendly and welcoming. It's a unique and cute place to sit and talk with people or focus on any work you may be doing. I like to drink their flavored iced teas (especially passion fruit, lychee, and kiwi). They are also known for their delicious green tea crepe cake and honey toast!"}
{"text":"A clean and cozy coffee shop at the back of a strip mall near Chinatown. Great place to hangout and bring friends over for coffee/dessert. The four of us shared the honey brick toast topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries. It was delicious... perfectly balanced with my coffee. Hubby ordered cafe latte, while our friends had jasmine tea and coffee smoothie. Overall, it was good!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered honey toast a little under a year ago. Mostly as a dessert at many of the all-you-can-eat sushi places here in Vegas. To my pleasant surprise I found this place, a place that specializes in honey toast!

If you've never had honey toast, it's very difficult to explain. It's almost like one of those Kings Hawaiian rolls with a sweet buttery taste to it. But it typically has a nice crispy crust on the outside.

IS Sweet makes it into an artform.

I came here on a Sunday night around 10:30 PM and it was completely packed. The clientele ranged from tourists to locals having dessert more than likely after dinner here in Chinatown. It's located in a small business/retail park off of Spring Mountain Road. Very easily accessible. Not sure how parking is during the day but at night it was pretty simple to find a spot.

All the drinks are listed on the chalkboard above the server station. Mainly coffees and teas. You have all the traditional's like lattes and mochas and coffee. The food portion is located from what we could tell on a fold out to go style menu by the register.

It's pretty basic. You get your honey toast and you can have it anyway you'd like it. The traditional way with just vanilla ice cream drizzled with fresh honey or anything else out of there multitude of ingredients such as chocolate sauce, green tea ice cream, fresh fruit.

I went ahead and got the traditional. Yummy warm fresh honey toast topped off with vanilla ice cream and honey drizzled all over it. I give this a firm 5/5. It took about 15 minutes to prepare and they let you know this ahead of time. Each honey toast order is about a 15 minute wait which I believe is the big time.

To drink I went with an iced mocha. I'll go ahead and give this one a 3/5. Don't get me wrong it was good and it was tasty but nothing over-the-top about it. Same price as if you were to go to Starbucks or coffee bean or any other place like that.

My friend got the traditional but topped off with fresh strawberries. She gave hers a firm 5/5 also. She had the red velvet latte. They use the powdered flavors here like coffee beans instead of the syrups like Starbucks. It tends to make the light is a little less on the sweet side which we enjoyed.

We sat down patiently waited for about 15 minutes before our two massive honey toasts came out. The taste was incredible. The toast itself had a flaky crispy crust on the outside and the inside had a sweet buttery taste to it that was soft and moist. The ice cream went ahead and melted through and through. The scoop is a little bit small for the size of the toast. It was probably a 5 x 5 square with about a 4 inch tall toast.

These are pretty massive. Saw a lot of people sharing desserts. We went ahead and ordered one each. Luckily we had a light dinner.

I definitely would recommend this place by far. Being in the heart of Chinatown makes it a great spot to go after you have dinner. Ample parking and a clean and minimalistic design on the inside."}
{"text":"Perfectly sweet desserts! We ordered the cheesecake, which was not overly cheesey or dense and served with fresh strawberry, and a crepe cake, which I'm not exaggerating when I say, with each bite it became more addicting! It was served with a strawberry sauce you drizzle on yourself too! Though sharing is always great, these taste so good you'll want one all to yourself! Who doesn't love cute things? This shop IS SWEET-looking and the staff is so kind. If I didn't already have coffee, I'd try their drinks next time."}
{"text":"In love with this place! I'm here every other week lol 
Creme br√ªl√©e is on point af. Green tea crepe is hella on point bruh. For a refreshing drink, I recommend the lychee ice green tea. Free wifi and great set up! The owners are super chill and nice peeps. I love how the location is in the cut, because if it wasn't, it would always be pack af."}
{"text":"Oh EM G!!! Gah this place is amazing.  The honey toast is so good.  The coffee is good to.  This is my second time here in one week."}
{"text":"A cute lil gem that I would have never come across if it weren't for Amy in concierge at Aria who recommended this place. I'm so glad I listened to her. 
It's off the strip in a lil part of Chinatown that's not far at all. A 10 min drive from Aria, and you're there. 
I had the honey toast that Amy had recommended and it was to die for! I ordered mine with Nutella and matcha ice cream. The honey toast was huge, definitely enough for two people to share. The price wasn't bad at all too. About $6 for the honey toast with the additional toppings. 
We came after lunch around 1:30pm, and it was only us and another couple. The lady behind the counter said it's much busier during the evening hours. Glad I came after lunch then."}
{"text":"I love this place and I would definitely go back there. Is nice and quiet, The furniture is hodgepodge that I love. The whole rustic feeling. Drinks dessert very delicious. Customer service great."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I've never written a review on this place seeing as I've been here a couple times. 

Directions: it looks like maps has finally gotten the place correct. I used to always drive past it because the area it's in is pretty odd. The complex contains various businesses, a restaurant, and their cafe at the end. If it's your first time going here, you may or may not miss it. Parking: make sure you do not park in certain covered areas. I believe they still have signs about not parking there. Whether or not they abide by it is not known. 

Decor: such a cute cafe. They have different decorated walls(brick, light pink...etc)various types of comfy chairs and spaces to sit at as well as smaller or larger tables to accommodate 1-2, or larger groups. :) 
*i come here to do work sometimes because of the free wifi, various outlets, and good cafe food and teas to sip on while grading or studying. 

Food/drink: I originally came here because I LOVE crepe cakes and I wanted to try their green tea crepe cake. Still so good! It's lights and fluffy and not overly sweet, with a good matcha flavor. I just recently tried their honey toast and it is also very good! You can add different toppings from the list provided to customize it to your liking. I suggest getting a tea (iced or hot) to pair with it. :) 

They have lots of different sweets and drinks to try within their little cafe that it makes for a great dessert place, work place, or meeting place :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place!!! I also love bringing all of my family & friends to try the great food and all different coffees & drinks they have here.The customer service is the best they always give great customer service no matter how busy they get! It is a very clean environment and nice to just sit back and relax and play catch up with friends and family!! Must try the Honey Toast with ice cream my personal favoite!!"}
{"text":"I give 3 stars because the cake was \"pretty\" and photo worthy but....way overpriced .. Food and drinks can be described as \"is okay\"   it's hard to mess up anything with sugar and high calories but the part that turned me off about this place was when the man ringing us up asked  if we wanted ice cream with the cake we said sure so they added a very very small scoop of low quality ice cream to our plate. He then told me the total I don't remember the exact amount maybe close to 20 with 2 drinks and 1 green tea cake to share.  I gladly handed my card...
Well I guess the guy (the owner I think )didn't ring up the ice cream side so he came over to our table to demand our payment of 1 or 2 bucks more because he forgot to ring up the ice cream side!! I have no problem with the amount or paying but as we're eating he interrupted us and made me get up and leave my table to go up to the counter to pay again all over 2bucks max... Really?? it was his mistake! You're that cheap !? was it really worth rudely interrupting my date and I's conversation and making us get up from our seats demanding me to pay you 2 bucks more when it was your fault to begin with, he didn't even apologize !? Makes me wonder where else are they cutting corners to save money?"}
{"text":"Officially the best crepe cake I've ever tried!!!! The matcha flavor was just right combined with a beautiful display, it was nothing but perfection. The place is located in a corner of a small plaza with mostly local patrons. Very cute and modernized vintage vibe. Great place for an afternoon snack or just catching up with friends."}
{"text":"IS Sweet is now my favorite desert place to go. Quite, Clean and Cozy place to hang out with free Wifi. There Creme Brulee is a \"Must\" have! The taste of the Brulee just melts in your mouth and it isn't too sweet either. The red velvet crepe was kind of odd. It had the red velvet taste but it was very light which was surprising. I highly recommend this place if you love cream br√ªl√©e as much as I do!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cozy and cute! We came for dessert after dinner and shared the honey toast and also ordered a pot of the rose green tea.

The tea came out promptly in the cutest teapot ever! The tea was strong but I found the rose flavor a little too subtle. I originally wanted to order just two cups but was recommended to get the whole pot instead, and I'm glad I did! For just a dollar more we got at least 4 cups worth of tea.

The honey toast takes a bit of a wait, but they make it to order so it comes out hot with a crisp exterior. I found it a bit dry but it was great when eaten with the ice cream. It comes with honey and whipped cream but they also offer other toppings for an additional charge. 

I had a little trouble finding this place as it's tucked away in a corner. Also found the menu a bit confusing as they display just the drinks on the menu board and have the desserts and prices scattered near the counter. They manage to fit a lot of seating in the small dining space but it was still packed on a weeknight! Might have to be prepared for a bit of a wait during the weekend."}
{"text":"Visited here this morning to see what it's like while I pick up my coffee. It's a cute little cozy cafe with very friendly staff. Cute decor too. I'll come back to taste those sweets next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes to study at or grab some dessert or both. The place is quite hidden so I hope you have your GPS out. Aside from that their honey toast here is AMAZING. The place is very spacious and clean but what I like about this place is that the water is filled with fresh fruit like strawberries sometimes so you get a hint of sweetness with your water. Service is decent for the most part. Only reason for the 4 stars is that the employees tend to keep an eye out on you to make sure you order something. Even if you're not ready they'll repeatedly ask every few minutes if you're ready to order."}
{"text":"Very calm little cute dessert place if you ask me. I enjoyed the vibe that I get at IS SWEET. Even though they ran out of green tea ice cream. The staff asked me nicely if I'm willing to have a replacement for the green tea ice cream. So I had a chocolate honey toast instead and a matching tiramisu latte it taste delicious.."}
{"text":"This is the only place I know of that I can get a red velvet coffee, and it is awesome! Cheesecake is bad ass too!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after dinner, seeing that Sweet Raku was still closed, we came here as a second option and WOWWWW !! Wayyyy better choice. I got the pistachio latte even though it was the middle of August and a red velvet crepe cake. Everything was DELICOUS. Work of art."}
{"text":"Maya is awesome, she gives great recommendation on desserts. Always smiling, great service."}
{"text":"If you have time to wait for a sweet treat, its definitely worth stopping in. The crepe cakes are not very sweet themselves, but come with accompanying sauces that you can pour or dip to your taste. The specialty coffees are strong and sweet. And then there's the Honey Toast. Not my first time trying one, but the best I've had. You can choose from a variety of toppings and sauces to make it your own personal creation. I chose vanilla pudding, strawberries, and ice cream. There were so many more options that I'm for sure going back to try some more. If you are having a hard time deciding, the friendly staff is more than happy to help you narrow down your choices. Definitely a hidden gem, as its not visible from the street."}
{"text":"If you like honey toast, you need to go here. If you've never had honey toast, YOU NEED TO GO HERE. 
 
This is a great place to bring a date or a group of friends who want something sweet but want something outside the box. The last night I was here the music selection was great which is neither here nor there. 

The one ding - the crepe cake doesn't taste as good as it looks. 

One surprise - the brownie sundae is really good and the presentation makes it a wonderful ig post for all you influencers and wanna be influencers. 

I'm not much of a coffee drinker but their lattes seem pretty popular. 

Main course, the honey toast is basically a build your own sundae big enough for two ppl to share. There are also plenty of pictures and recommended builds you can go with."}
{"text":"The honey toast was amazing and the caramel macchiato was so delicious! The presentation was beautiful! I loved it! The only downside is the location......a little hidden.

Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I almost couldn't find this place.  I must need a new pair of glasses not to have seen the sign despite it standing right in front of a Vietnamese restaurant as you turn into the (very) small shopping plaza.  Just drive a little ways straight to the end of the building, and the coffee shop is right there.  I ordered the iced caramel macchiato, and I was surprised that it was as good if not better than Starbucks!  It seems to be mostly a beverage place because the desserts are limited.  The service was super friendly, and I'll surely return to try the other drinks on their menu!  ^_^"}
{"text":"Seriously the cutest little shop in Las Vegas for Desserts! The interior design gives a welcoming feeling. It's quirky and colorful. The drinks are delicious and the Honey Toast is absolutely amazing! Buttery and sweet on the inside. You should definitely pop in to try this out! It's kind of hard to find. It's in the corner of a plaza next to Viet Noodles shop."}
{"text":"Great service. Always on point but it's a bit to expensive when it comes to their food. It's worth it"}
{"text":"IS so very SWEET. 

From the street you would never walk-in here mostly because you couldn't see the place. It's at the very end of a random strip mall between a few restaurants and I believe and empty building.  

I walked in and it was completely empty, which was a good thing, because this place is very tiny, maybe eight tables and a few chairs with coffee tables. I was hoping for a savory something to eat, but obviously with a name like IS SWEET, I shouldn't have been so optimistic. I took the cashier's advice and went with the Honey Toast over a waffle and an Iced Americano. 

The iced Americano was very good. Most places don't have the proper gear to provide a solid espresso drink, but IS SWEET pulls it off nicely. No funky or burnt aftertaste, pure caffeinated bliss.

The Honey Toast here might as well be the Incredible Hulk of breakfast breads. Think thick like Texas Toast and sweet like Hawaiian bread. Then cover that in Nutella and a vanilla pudding with side of whipped cream. Yowza, food can get you sexually charged. Not only did I eat the entire thing, I pretty much inhaled it with about three bites. I'm not a sugar lover so; you can imagine how good this dish is. 

The bottom of the Honey Toast was crispy from being lightly fried, but the middle of the bread was so airy and soft, that the drizzle on top slowly weighed it down and actually had the bread dipping in the center. Great textures and flavor combos going on with this sweet option. 

The menu is filled with so many beverages and sweet confections, that I'm already figuring out ways to get myself in this part of town more often. 

Honey Toast go boom!"}
{"text":"Such a cute shop!! I ordered the green tea Mille crepe cake and the presentation was so beautiful. Everything in the shop made it perfect for Instagram pictures. The lighting and neutral color of the table as well as the dessert itself gave me the most gorgeous Instagram food picture ever. The cake was good but it needed a stronger matcha taste. The green tea syrup helped, but when I'm looking for a green tea dessert I really want the matcha flavor. My bf got a strawberry smoothie that came in a jar. Even though there wasn't a lot of fresh strawberries (the guy used some sort of puree / syrup) my bf thought it still tasted good, but it would've been preferably if they threw in more real strawberries.

Prices were a bit high but we're from SoCal where boba is dirt cheap so maybe it's normal prices for the Vegas area"}
{"text":"Cute place! Kind of reminds of Serenade actually if you've ever been there. It is a bit hard to find though since it's in a weird complex and is the last building so keep your eyes peeled! My friends and I thought this would be the perfect place to come after the Hello Kitty Friendship Festival about two weeks ago lol and so we got a waffle with brownies, strawberries, chocolate sauce and strawberry ice cream plus Honey Dew Milk Tea & Lychee Tea.
The waffle was served nice and warm and was actually larger than I expected loaded with a ton of toppings! This was heaven. The Honey Dew Milk and Lychee Tea were really good as well served in cute mason jars. I will warn you, they were a bit on the super sweet side so tell them less sweet if you don't want a candy taste. 
As for seating, there's a good amount, a bunch of mismatched sizes and shapes of chairs. Music wasn't too loud but a very random mix. I really like that the hours are the same everyday from 11am-Midnight! & It was also nice seeing Philip T. there! lol
Overall I'll be back to try more of their large menu of teas, coffees, frappes, etc. as well as their Creme Brulee, Matcha Crepe Cake and Coffee Butter Cake! Yum! :)
Oh and don't forget to check-in for 10% off!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to bring my 5 y/o niece here because she asked for dessert after lunch and she loved it! Cute cafe. Perfect spot for study sesh or to just hang out. There's always a group of people at the long table studying everytime I come here - which sometimes makes it difficult to find a seat during peak hours. If you love honey toast, this is the spot to go! Their presentations are always on point."}
{"text":"Stop by this place today to try their red velvet crepe.  First thing... It was pretty dead for a Friday. There were only two other people there besides us. I ordered the red velvet crepe. I didn't order anything else because I wasn't sure about ordering more from the menu till I try the crepe. The presentation of the crepe was very pretty. The crepe though was just plain...didn't taste like red velvet. It taste like I was just eating lots of whip creme. Sorry nothing great."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5, if 4.5 were possible! 

Cute and cozy, IS SWEET is a great dessert getaway in the same complex as Viet Noodle Bar. 

Honey toast and cakes are plated with great presentation. 
Two popular desserts:
- 6.50 for crepe cake (Vanilla, matcha, or red velvet) 
- 4.00 for honey toast base, toppings range from .50 to 1.26
- big variety of coffee and hot tea available 

Small staff is very nice. IS SWEET has a small, family-owner vibe to it. 

This place barely missed the mark, but the honey toast was not cooked completely through after coming out of the freezer and still had that undone/overly chewy bread thing going on at some parts instead of being crisp and caramelized. 

Call me a 5 year old, but actually cutting a honey toast mountain with a butter knife is close to an act of God. Perhaps next time I'll BYO Knife, but at least there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"I've seen the crepe cakes from fellow Yelpers and foodie Instagrammers. I finally made it here.  It was Chinese New Year so I had a good excuse to come get sweets.  

Small and quaint space.  Like all the different chairs and tables which adds to a rustic feel.  We ordered the Matcha Crepe Cake, Hello Kitty Strawberry Cake and Nutella Cake.  The presentation was done well.  

The  crepe cake was too pretty to eat.  Those layers though!!!  And drizzling the matcha sauce on the crepe cake made for a good video.  I was expecting so much more for the crepe cake and I felt it wasn't as good as I anticipated.  Not sure if it is the matcha flavor but it didn't wow me when I ate it.  I just didn't love it.  Presentation wise, it's gorgeous.  Is Sweet also offers the crepe cake in vanilla and red velvet.  I'll have to come back and give the other flavors a shot.

The Strawberry Cake and Nutella Mousse were light and tasty.  Not too sweet and just the way I like it.  The Nutella Mousse was a beautiful presentation as well and super cute.  

I'll be back to try the other crepe cake flavors!"}
{"text":"Is Sweet is hands down my favorite cafe in town. The employees are kind and patient, the environment is cute (especially during the day!), and the food & beverages are not only presented in a super cute way, but they are super delicious as well. I've tried mostly everything on their menu, but my usual order is a pistachio latte, honey toast with kiwi and vanilla ice cream, and a green tea crepe cake.. I know, soo healthy.

The first few times coming here was difficult, because it's in such a random location, but once you see the Viet Noodle Bar, turn right!

You really can't go wrong at Is Sweet, because regardless of what you order, it will be tasty."}
{"text":"I was craving something sweet after dinner so I looked up a dessert place nearby. O.M.G! This place is delicious!!! We got the honey toast with sweetened condensed milk and strawberries. SOOOO GOOD!!!!  I highly recommend their honey toast. It's much better than others I have had and they were already really good. It's perfect for sharing with 2-3. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"The crepe really has no flavor, its like eating paper. However eveything ekse was good..the honey toast with all the fruit topping choices. I would skip the white choc chips...it would be better melted. Strawberry shake was so good"}
{"text":"The service was quick, the staff was friendly. I ordered the matcha cake as well as the Honey Toast (with kiwi). I definitely had a sugar overload that night but I think the honey toast tastes best with kiwi since it balances the sweetness of the toast. Hands down my favorite item is the honey toast, at least relative to the matcha cake."}
{"text":"When it comes to dessert, Is Sweet is one of my favorite places to visit. The ambience is very relaxed and it doesn't get too loud here. I love that they have many chairs and tables available for their patrons, and it's great that the place isn't cramped either.

As far as the desserts go, they have a variety you can pick from. I usually get the honey toast with Nutella and strawberries topped with vanilla ice cream. Their toast is my favorite compared to most places that I've tried that also serves the same thing. I love their Nutella frappe as well. Their matcha crepe cakes are also delicious and it's my favorite flavor out of the three that they have.

Definitely without a doubt will recommend this place time and time again!"}
{"text":"Good amount of seats except some of the tables are so low. Very clean and there wasn't a long wait for our drinks even though there was only one person working. I order an iced matcha green tea latte with a shot of espresso while my friends for the red velvet latte and a hot matcha green tea latte. We shared the matcha green tea crepe cake with green tea ice cream. 

My matcha latte tasted a lot like seaweed for some reason. I've had matcha lattes at serenade, sunset coffee and a few other places before and remember them being very creamy with a subtle hint of matcha... Also with no seaweed taste. I also tried my friends hot latte and it tasted like my iced one. I liked that they put the iced drink in a mason cup. My friend enjoyed his red velvet latte.

The matcha crepe cake wasn't very sweet. I would recommend getting ice cream with it. I liked the ice cream more than I liked the cake. I was expecting it to be less dense and a little sweeter."}
{"text":"Green tea crepe cake: In my opinion, too much cream, not enough crepe, on the soggy side. But the playing is on point. 

The coconut  lava toast: This is super duper good. Definitely a must try with coconut  pieces & condense milk oozing out."}
{"text":"Honey toast is really good and the crepe cake is the best. I would recommend the green tea crepe cake. It is really good and the atmosphere is really  calming to be in."}
{"text":"If you want mille cr√™pe cakes, this is the place. I usually come here for their cakes and honey toast which are very good! There are many toppings you can put on your honey toast, but I prefer it with a scoop of green tea ice cream and lots of fruit. Now for the mille cr√™pe cakes... GET IT! You won't regret it! I tend to order the matcha one and it comes with this little container of matcha sauce that you pour over your cake. It is just way too good! Also, you can just come to study during the day because it's nice and quiet. Overall, the placing of the store is a bit hard to find but the view is just great, there are many seats to choose from, the interior is cute, and the employees are very friendly. 
Oh here's a tip, don't try to come around the last two hours before closing because the cafe is always filled! Plus since it's getting cold, I highly doubt people would want to sit in the chairs outside."}
{"text":"Looks Good-- tasted like Old Frozen Cake with Wax texture. :( .... so disappointing... honestly could not even eat it. Tried to chew it, then tried to swallow it, really disappointing... especially when Raku Sweets is down the way.. it's double the price, prepared and made to order:: cream puffs are filled at time of Order - or easier said : Cooked to Order: so.. man... gonna hope they change it to the toast ? Give it a try... :( never mind she said I couldn't change to something else, even though she said she would refund my money ? 
All well.... also tried the summer Special Volcano Shake ... I would have rather paid for the Shake at Sonic ... nope...."}
{"text":"Their matcha green tea crepe cake is amazing. I had this cake two times in a week back in June. And it was delicious! I would highly recommend that cake time and time again. I also had the matcha green milk tea slush/smoothie and it was just as amazing. The atmosphere is nice and the cashier who rang us was nice! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my go to spots for some drinks but they've gotten ridden of a couple of things. First, they don't have boba anymore.  Second, they don't have honeydew drinks. Bummer, cause their honeydew drinks were really good. 

Ended up get a mango slush and a honey toast with Nutella, strawberries and whip cream on it. 

The mango slush was good. Refreshing after a heavy meal. 
The honey toast was pretty good. They toast them perfectly. Outer side not too hard where it just crumbles and the inside, of course, was soft like it should be. It was like a magic trick when I turned around cause it was gone pretty fast. 
 
Atmosphere of the place is laid back, relax or you can get some studying done as I did before. Comfy chairs around. 

Service was good, took our orders right away."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh!! This place was amazing, we shared these goodies and the portions were a good size. You have a verity of options for toppings on the honey toast. I definitely recommend this place for a sweet tooth or in my case a cheat treat.  so Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Dropped by after dinner at Hwa Ro and came at the perfect time.   Immediately after a group of 6 of us ordered, this place got slammed with a line of 10-12 people.

I felt bad for the cashier who not only took the orders, but made the drinks and prepared the desserts.  Help get her some help!!

Anyhow the matcha green tea crepe was great - not too sweet and i liked the fruit and sauce that accompanied it.  They have a variety of desserts to try.  Everything looks great.

There's a 10% check in deal if you get a drink and dessert but she didn't even make us check in.

Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My sister found this place through yelp & I am so happy we decided to drop in to try it out! It was delicious. They don't always offer the same sweets so it makes for a fun return. We had the coconut cake, the hello kitty strawberry one, and a nutella iced latte! It was all to die for. I honestly have not one complaint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was ok.  I ordered an Irish cream frap which tasted good, but it was mixed with so much ice I could only drink 1/3 of it... the rest was too frozen to go up the straw.  :/ Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Girl's day out with my cousins and Sizzling brownie, Nutella honey toast and green tea crepe cake happened!  Not a sweet tooth, so as yummy as these were they were a sweet tooth's dream. I love a warm brownie and loved that the most sans the ice cream since I have dairy sensitivity.

The green tea crepe cake became my fave since it wasn't too sweet. There just wasn't much flavor to it even with the green tea sauce on the side. 

I also tried the taro Latte for the first time. I'd have given 4 stars if they offered unsweetened almond or coconut milk. I opted for soy, but soy doesn't agree with me much. Otherwise it was good.

Recommended for sweet tooths."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dessert cafe at all time!! I just have try a new menu which is coconut lava toast thats so awesome!!! I love it."}
{"text":"A really cute and cozy lil dessert house located in the same plaza as Viet Noodle Bar. Since they are walking distance from each other, it's a great place to have dessert after having dinner. :]

I highly recommend their crepe cakes. They make three different flavors (Vanilla, Matcha, and Red Velvet) and each one is delicious. They are not overly sweet and one slice can be shared between two people. You can also add ice-cream on the side.

My personal favorites are the Vanilla and Matcha. However, if you're not a fan of the green-tea based flavor, it might be best to order the other two. One time, I saw a couple waste the whole thing! I guess they're not a fan of the Japanese green tea?

Maya, one of the owners, is very nice. She's usually the one working behind the counter. Every time my fam and I come here, she remembers us. 

Space is very limited here, but they do offer extra chairs that are stacked near the entrance for additional seating. If you're in the mood for something that \"Is Sweet\" (LOL), give this place a try. :]"}
{"text":"If you want fresh, bomb honey toast, then you gotta come here! Right away when you first walk in, you smell the deliciousness of the honey toast!
I always get their honey toast with strawberries, bananas, and Nutella. Sometimes with vanilla ice cream if I wanna be extra sweet. Lol
They also have teas, smoothies, coffee and non coffee beverages.
Ohh and they also have crepe cakes! Haven't tried them yet but my gf says it's really good!
Come check them out! I promise you that you won't regret it! Cheeeehooo!"}
{"text":"This place will satisfy a fat kid's dream aka me and my friends. WHY is it so good? 

- best fucking brick toast I've ever tried in my life
- best fucking crepe cake I've ever tried in my life
- maybe the best chocolate cake I've ever tried
- Tip: order tea. IT WILL HELP YOU EAT MORE

Once you're done with everything, the end. Go home, put on some pjs. You've had a hard day."}
{"text":"Ordered the greentea cheesecake with vanilla ice cream and it was very good. The presentation was absolutely beautiful tho, like my date."}
{"text":"Honey toast with strawberry ice cream and Nutella was so delicious. (Not pictured)I wasn't too fond of the matcha green tea crepe cake but Im picky with matcha.Originally wanted red velvet but came late on a Sunday night and they were out.  I love how the iced caramel macchiatos are served in mason jars. Very big, can be shared. I got it with soy milk.  Five stars"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite dessert place in Las Vegas. I have been here over 6xs and I fall more and more in love with it. I love how friendly the staff is and especially Game. He is the best! I always go for their matcha ice tea (delicious) and their amazing green tea crepe cake (to die for). I've tried their waffle before and was not a huge fan of it. The place is very cute and the environment is great."}
{"text":"We came in about 15 minutes to closing. They looked at us from the car to see if we were coming in and as soon as we walked in we were immediately told they will be closing in 15. If businesses don't want to help you before they close they should just close even earlier or have a sign or something. If I was a business owner and a customer rushes in it doesn't matter when they came in I would still make them feel like their business was appreciated! 9:55 pm money is the same as 1:00 pm money! Instead of leaving like I should have we ordered two drinks and two desserts. Instead of giving the drinks in a glass cup we were given the to-go cups. Which is funny because although we came in 15 minutes before closing we left before a few of the other parties! We should have been given the full experience not felt rushed and unappreciated. 

We get our hello kitty cake and creme brulee relatively quickly and our drinks took a little longer than expected. They do not offer boba on the menu which was surprising to me. The creme brulee was alright and so was the cake. They were nicely decorated and extremely overpriced. The drinks were average as well. Average drinks, average sweets, and indifferent customer service...I'll pass."}
{"text":"So this review is only for their Crepe Cakes.  I just stooped in for dessert.  After finally finding this place - silly google map had issues I was surprised to see how small the place is.  It was nice inside but not a very big seating area.  The service was good as they had a one man operation in effect.  I was lucky they were not busy.  They have only a small case of sweets and the Crepe Cakes are not in the case but listed on a small menu board near the case.  
    I ordered the three varieties they had of Crepe cakes for our dessert.  We got Vanilla, Matcha and Red Velvet.  They were all delicious.  They all came with strawberries and a unique sauce.  They were unlike any cake we had ever had.  Not as overly filling as i thought which was a positive thing.  They were light sweet which a prefer and that made the taste ever more pronounced.   They all had great flavor and we enjoyed all three.
   The location leaves allot to be desired.  They are on the end of a long building so they can be hard to find if using your Iphone.  That is my only real complaint.  Not that i have found them looking forward to trying their drink selection next time."}
{"text":"Worm welcome amd Very good service comfortable  seat.. It good place to hang  out friends  or Cople.  Awesome  Ceps  cake. I love it."}
{"text":"IT IS AS THEY SAY... SWEET! 

**2016 YELP 100 LV CHALLENGE #2**

Came here looking for something to get my SWEET cravings taken care of & after looking at so many YELP photos for this place I begged my hubby to come here. 

The girl that took care of us was super SWEET too ahahahha =] 

NUTELLA FRAPPE $4.65 - this is like nutella BLAST in yo face sweet ahahaha they charge $0.50 for whipped cream.... it could have definitely been a bit thicker in my opinion.

MATCHA CREPE CAKE $6.95 - this was absolutely DERICIOUS!! Yelpers did not disappoint when it came to helping my decision to choose this. Loved every bit from presentation on a mini wood board to the mini cup of matcha white chocolate  drizzle thingy that came on the side to sweeten up the thinly layered crepe cake! x3

CARAMEL MACHIATTO $4.95 - this was a kick in the face strong w/ caffeine flavor which is always nice. Made a nice balance w/ the sweetness of the caramel."}
{"text":"I only write reviews for places that I think is extraordinary and I think Is Sweets deserves a glowing review! I'll keep my review short because I dont think there are enough words to describe how good this place is. The green tea crepe cake is absolutely amazing and the only place that I can think of that can compare is Suzuya (which is also extraordinary in my opinion)! So next time you're anywhere near Spring Mountain and is looking for a really good dessert place or just a place to hang out (they're open until midnight now yey!) don't even think! Just go straight to Is Sweets! Can't wait to try the waffles and honey toast! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I were looking for a place to have some dessert and we happened to find this place on yelp and thank god we did .  Everything about this place was great . I have so many good things to say ...the guy that rang us up was very nice, music was so great , the place is cute and clean , and the things we got were AMAZING ! We ordered the Green tea crepe cake with green tea ice cream and the Nutella Mousse... WOW! I will most definitely be back here again . If you haven't tried this place .. you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Oh man, what can I say about this place? Pretty much the name says it all! I first found out about this place when my news feed started blowing up with pictures of this crepe cake. As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to try it the next time I was in town.

When I initially entered, the first thing I noticed was the sweet aroma; it just made me crave it all even more! All the sweets on display were tantalizing me (creme br√ªl√©e and cheesecake, among others), but I came for one thing and one thing only.

We ordered the green tea crepe cake, and it comes with the option of ice cream. We chose vanilla to complement it. As soon as we got our order, wow! We were so impressed by the display and presentation. A+ for that. We drizzled the green tea sauce over the ice cream and cake, and dug in.

OH. MY. GOODNESS. WOW. The texture was fluffy! Layers of crepe sandwiching sweet cream, together with the ice cream, and matcha sauce all created an orchestra of flavor! It was amazing. It was also served with berries to help break some of the green tea flavor. But wow was it good. The next time I came back, I tried the vanilla crepe cake with strawberry ice cream, and personally, I had more of an affinity for that one!

The service was really good. The cashier (a younger man with what sounded like a Thai accent) was very nice and very pleasant. He was very patient when we were debating ordering other items, and always managed to keep a smile on his face. He was the one who also prepared our dish, and delivered it straight to us at our table.

Overall, I really, genuinely like this place. I will definitely return here, but need to broaden my horizons and try some of the other food items (and drinks). I'm sure they'll be superb, as well!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 stars.. we ordered the green tea layered cake. It was a light treat but a little bland. Be careful what toppings you choose for this because each one is an extra dollar. The ice cream is an extra $1.50. That's kinda steep :-/ 

We also ordered the honey toast. Toppings tip applies to this too. Nonetheless, the honey toast was amazing, done perfectly. We added just strawberries. My family and I enjoyed this one so much, it disappeared in less that two minutes, if that. 

We came here around 9:30pm, and they were already out of green tea ice cream and soy milk which I preferred for my matcha latte. Oh well, it was still delicious with the nonfat milk they used instead. 

Overall, I would prob stop by here again in the future for their lattes and honey toast."}
{"text":"One of the cutest cafes I've been to. Atmosphere is nice for a small place. Kinda hard to find though. Got the green tea crepe cake. A place I'd definitely go back to when I'm craving sweets."}
{"text":"We had the honey toast with vanilla ice cream and strawberries (It's one of the pictures hanging near the front counter). It also had condensed milk drizzled on top. The bread was soft and fresh and the ice cream added a nice creamy touch. 

The store has a very relaxing atmosphere. It's a place where people can come to relax and spend time with friends. The prices are good and they have free wifi."}
{"text":"Oh your gosh Becky! Look. At. Her. Toast! You like big toast? Toast to me used to be like two slices, slap on butter, maybe add sugar and dip in coffee. 

Here! Toast is like half a loaf full of carbs, and smothered with your dessert dish. Breakfast dessert fusion. Hey I like that! 

Cute interior. Nothing exactly matches tables and chairs wise. I'll say I approve of its kookyness : )

Nice ladies helped us place our order. I think one of them almost wanted to laugh at me and Ness having an eedy beedy teensy weensy argument over what we wanted for toppings. And so it turned out like our picture as posted. 

Like mother like daughter - sweet tooth mania. One thing we did agree on without questions- iced matcha green tea. 

What's cool is you pretty much build onto your honey toast. There are more fun flavors and fusions on the menu. They also offer regular cake slices like tiramisu, chocolate, and cheesecake. Cavity chasers this is your place!

It's all in the name."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, and this place Is pretty Sweet. They have some of the best honey toast in town. The toast is baked to perfection, and the combination of ice cream on top of the toast drizzled with honey all over is just mmmm mmmm mmmm, sex in yo mouth. I also tried their popular matcha crepe cake, but I won't be getting that again. It was just plain bad and didn't taste like matcha at all. Also, I've only tried their hot herbal teas so I can't give an honest review about their drinks just yet."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and it's always awesome. This time I ordered honey toast with strawberry, banana, with Nutella topping topping and also tiramisu. They both were awesome as it used to. I got dark chocolate it also great. My friend ordered chocolate volcano but he said it's not favorfull."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place. No customer service, not even a smile. They serve tea, but no tea latte? I mean it's not like they don't have milk..."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  The honey toast here is by far the best in town.  Recently the coffee has become a little weak, and bland. Not sure what changed. There is 1 guy that makes it the best,  but he's not been there the last few times I've came.  Still like it here though, and will keep coming.  The tirimasu is really good,  and so is the cheesecake.  The music is not crazy loud like some places,  and the decor is fun and welcoming.  Expect to sit here for a while,  cuz you're going to want too. They don't try to rush you out.  They get that people like to hang out. Why not,  you'll probably stay longer and get more desserts or coffee,  which is usually the case when I come."}
{"text":"This was a lovely experience.  My roomie and I love to go to new restaurants in Chinatown and we saw this one open up near our home.  Since we both love coffee so much, we decided to stop in.

The drinks were delicious and smooth.  The service was also excellent as they were more than attentive, letting us know they can change the drinks to our taste.  It's very difficult to find a Dark Chocolate smoothie in Chinatown (as most have the traditional Asian flavors: tarot, honeydew, macha, etc), so I was pleased that they had something a little different.

Everything is very cozy and has a lovely view.  This is my new cafe stop."}
{"text":"Great setting but boring food and instead of a hot latte i got milky water.... 
Just not for me."}
{"text":"Dam. They changed the menu on me. I really really like this place. Idk what to do now. No more honeydew!!!!  And waffles are also gone. The customer service is still good. It's a chill place to relax. I doubt I'll be back after the menu change. It could be expensive, just really depends on what you order."}
{"text":"Second time back! I first walked in here a week ago and had their red velvet latte, the taste was so good that we have to return once again to try more! Ordered the white chocolate last night adding organic soy milk to it was the best decision ever! These drinks are a must-try.

Other than drinks we had shared a honey toast amongst 4 people too, we all had a good time. The atmosphere is so cute there it's a good spot for couples or small groups to hang out or just be productive on your laptop with."}
{"text":"Iced latte - strong just how I liked it. 
Jasmine tea - also strong jasmine flavor! 
Vanilla cr√®pe cake - perfect! Wasn't too sweet and it wasn't bland either. The sweet cream filling balanced out with the tarty strawberry and chocolate sauce.

Cute little Caf√©. The only small complaint is that the seats are a little uncomfortable if you're not on the couch side. If you're dropping by for a quick bite to eat, no problem. The young lady there was very nice and recommended  a few other things on their menu for next time. I'm definitely gonna come back! Good food, good drinks, and good service :) (which is a bonus!) FREE WiFi !"}
{"text":"The only thing I'd recommend, if you happen to check this place out, is their honey toast. There are other places in town that serve better ones though. The mille crepe cake is ok. Again, I've had better. Their drinks are pretty weak too, so I wouldn't recommend them. I've had their matcha latte and cafe latte. Both tasted like milk to me. Couldn't find the matcha or coffee flavor at all. Service is kind of non-existent."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to relax and enjoy a dessert, they're very nice and sweet!!! Prices are very low, coffee is good too, the only thing that annoyed me , is the kids that just seat in the tables to kill time with out even order nothing!!! Anyway owners problem, location is very close to the Chinatown but easy to find."}
{"text":"If it's not with their good desserts, i wouldn't go here! No hi no hello! Staff wouldn't approach u, so you need to do something for them to give u attention! But again the dark choc drink and red velvet crepe were amazing!"}
{"text":"Honey Toast here is delicious.  Nice cafe atmosphere with free Wi-Fi!  Many choices of beverages and good size cups.  Liked that they offer water dispenser because was really thirsty after dessert, but I hadn't ordered coffee or tea to go with it but wish I did!  Will go back next time to hang out there and get more!"}
{"text":"It's in the plaza, we didn't know why yelp cannot provide the correct navigation for their store. It seems a lot of difference drinks you can choose from their menu. We didn't wanna drink too much sugar at the late night, so we just ordered a toast with some fruit on top. It's not bad. They put honey on top of the toast to enhance the flavor of the white toas"}
{"text":"My second visit here, I got the honey toast because I love how we can choose our own toppings. I feel the service and the honey toast are great, but when I got the earl grey tea, it was really watered down, and way too cold to brew inside the pot. I was highly disappointed and was barely able to even finish one cup. I didn't bother troubling the employees with this, we did ask for more hot water but still, the water was nearly lukewarm, and the tea was still watered down. I also question how sanitary the teapots are, because there was lots of tea residue inside the spout that we wiped out with napkin before pouring. I would likely come back for the honey toast, but wouldn't get the tea again. Overall the service and the dessert were just fine."}
{"text":"Finally, we could find the coffee&bakery shop where  we feel very comfortable ...their cakes and coffee are awesome  You guys gonna love it"}
{"text":"They ran out of the red velvet crepe cake by the time I got there at 9, so I tried the matcha crepe cake instead. It was decent, but nothing special. My bf ordered the creme br√ªl√©e & it was the worst I've ever had in all honesty. Next time I come, I'll probably just opt for their taro frappe."}
{"text":"We came to visit this place only to find it after 10 minutes of circling the area. The Yelp address is correct but the direction to this place is wrong, which is bizarre. Therefore, you must call the place to obtain proper directions. 

After finding this place, we asked the server what are they known for and what is popular he said the brick toast and their crepe cakes. I ordered their matcha crepe cake. I've never had matcha cakes before or let alone a crepe so I couldn't really compare. I thought it tasted great, very light and in between the crepe was a wiped cream filling. My boyfriend ordered their matcha tea drink, which tasted amazing as well. Overall, I was impressed with their desserts. Loved it! Would like to try their red velvet crepe next and many more!"}
{"text":"Hard to find, so keep your eyes peeled on the road. Once inside the dessert was amazing, and the tea was absolutely phenomenal. Service was great although it's a very small place everything is very nicely put together will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Here we go again, waited long enough !! Still the bomb blueberry latte and the fruit bread box!! If u still not try this place yet , come in and relax with the delicious drink and dessert!!"}
{"text":"When it first opened they didn't have a variety of things. But I will so come back! So glad they expanded their menu. Honey toast, crepe cakes, assorted cakes and drinks are"}
{"text":"What a cute romantic spot. So hidden and so worth finding. We came and had the tiramisu which was not only the best I've ever had and i never like them any where else because they make them with too much coffee or just not enjoyable. But here it's soft and delicious and they decorate beautiful. And the red velvet crepe is wow! Like little clouds of pastry and cream."}
{"text":"Got into a long and irritating argument with the lady at the counter because she said, \"I know service dogs are allowed here but right now, we can't have the dog here until the Food safety administration people approve of it because other people are getting upset about service dogs here.\"

So she acknowledged that service dogs are allowed, which I had one with me, but she wouldn't let me eat here because I had her with me. I handed her two cards stating that this dog is protected by federal law and that she is allowed to go anywhere that I go, she's a medical necessity. And it was just a back and forth back and forth pointless argument. Eventually she gave up and let me order my drink, which wasn't that good, and sit in their dining area. She was nice about it, I know she meant no harm and she's just doing what she's told, but her managers should know that the law states that a service dog is welcome everywhere a human is. PERIOD.

My low stars rating is because of my drink, which I think tasted weird and bitter since it was supposed to be an iced Nutella drink. And also because the argument."}
{"text":"We had their honey toast dessert and pistachio latte -- and it was amazing -- so I'm pretty sure the rest of the items on their menu is just as great.  It was very busy and we liked that they close a little late.  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"If you're not careful, you'll definitely drive right past it! It's located in the far end of the business complex so it's hard to see it from the street.

It's a cute little cafe for a small group of friends to hang out or even just to study if you're in the area. The decorations give that old yet modern look and it's kinda almost all over the place. If you're OCD, probably not the best place to go....it'll throw you for a loop for sure. 

I kept seeing friends post pictures on facebook and IG from here so I had to try it out! I got a pot of tea and a slice of red velvet crepe cake. Tea was tea, lol. The price wasn't too bad, but for a bag of tea it could be better. I'd say try one of their other specialty drinks, you'll get more of a bang for your buck! The red velvet crepe cake was alright. It didn't really taste much like red velvet at all, but it was light and fluffy. So I still enjoyed it! 

I can't wait to go back and try some other stuff off their menu, maybe the green tea crepe cake next time."}
{"text":"This place \"Is Amazing\"!! The honey toast is absolutely phenomenal!! Make sure you get condensed milk on it!! (Don't forget, it's the best) the ladies that work here are truly kind, please let them know how great they did when you see the display on the plate that's brought out to you!! Don't skip this place!! We come here multiple times every trip to Vegas?"}
{"text":"Their coffee frappes are delicious. Nutella frappe is strong , sweet, with a chocolate nuttiness.  So gewwwwwd. 

Honey toast is a must have.  

Our go to is honey toast with : 
Nutella, brownie bites, vanilla ice cream and whip cream.

2nd go to Honey toast with : 

Nutella, vanilla pudding, strawberries. 

You won't regret it.  It's freshly baked, warm and if you order it with ice cream ... the bread slowly soaks up all the goodness and then has a slight gooey chew to it. Mhm mhm mmmm. 

Try it friends."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite spots to get coffee or toast!! The toast here is amazing ! Be prepared to wait at least 10 min for them to make it but it's defiantly worth the wait ! And don't forget to try there white hot chocolate !"}
{"text":"They're known for their matcha green tea crepe cake ($6.50), so of course I couldn't resist giving it a try. With its multilayers and its fruit and drizzle accoutrements, it looked more like a piece of artwork that I didn't dare want to touch until well after I snapped a few photos to preserve this decadent moment. 

Verdict: It was good... but my friend's honey toast was way better! You can add toppings and ice cream for extra. (Be warned that honey toast and waffle preparation could take 15 minutes, as a sign explicitly states) I couldn't even finish the crepe cake because it was so sweet and the consistency got tiring near the end. I also had their lychee iced tea served in the ever-present mason jar, but it's not something I'd come back for. However, the man who rung me up did tell me he can remake any drink if I didn't like it, but I just stuck with it. 

The sparse decor is something you'd find in your crafty, yet slightly schizophrenic aunt's kitchen. The tables and chairs are severely mismatched, there's a faux brick wall in one corner for no reason. I don't know what theme they're going for, but overall, it's a cute place to come in and indulge in desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"This is some seriously amazing tea! Their Thai is incredible and the passion fruit iced tea is absolutely fantastic and refreshing! No joke some of the best Thai tea we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Is Sweet is a Very nice new place to come grab a drink a dessert! The people working there are very nice and friendly! I really like their drinks! Definitely will come back for a visit!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! 
Love the build your own honey toast at a reasonable price. The one guy we always see there is always pleasant, and courteous. The two items we had, the honey toast wasn't too sweet but still flavourful and so was the hazelnut frapp√©."}
{"text":"Today I was lucky enough to find this great little shop. My girl and I ordered two cafe lattes to go as we were in a rush, but needed a good coffee fix. We were both blown away by how wellmade the drinks looked and how good they tasted. If you're looking for a great latte give this place a try, you will not be disappointed. Next time I am town I will be stopping by again and I look forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Is sweet alright. 

Low key joint. Small exclusive little cafe hidden in the very corner. Wasn't that hard to find. Went in when they were just open so I had the whole place to myself. 

Menu serves all sorts of drink ranging from coffee drinks to milk teas and smoothies. The center of attention are there desserts. I ordered the cheese cake, multi layered cake and two other drinks. Very sweet and wonderful will be how I'll describe everything. The Matcha multi layered cake is the reason why I stopped here. There're so many post regarding this so I had to check it out. Very eye catching when it was all put together, probably there most famous dessert on the menu. 

Definitely recommending this to all my sweet tooth people. Can't say anything I ordered were bad, very much enjoyed everything and looking to return very soon. Service and food 10/10. 

Order the infamous layered cake !!!"}
{"text":"Honey Toast with fresh strawberries, whip cream, almonds & chocolate drizzle with a blended coffee mocha with dark chocolate was the bomb.com!!

Lots of variety to choose from for your add ons. So worth my time, gas & money! 

I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love how conveniently it's close to my favorite pho restaurant, Viet Noodle Bar. Visited this cozy place with some of my good friends who enjoys dessert as much as I do ! The decor is so lovely, I felt at ease even on the rainy day I visit . Most of us ordered the crepe cake after a long indecisive decision which I'm glad cause the crepe cake was so light that I had enough room for more desserts. Paired it with a delicious strawberry banana smoothie which was also enjoyable . On my next visit I definitely would like to try the honey toast . Looks so appetizing !"}
{"text":"I really like IS SWEET. The decor and concept is very cute and a pretty cool place to hang out. It's a little small so it can get crowded fairly quickly. I had the Crepe Matcha and the Shaved Ice. The Crepe Matcha is super yummy, although next time I'll probably ask for chocolate syrup in lieu of the matcha sauce. The Shaved Ice is huge! It's pretty much a tower of shaved ice, mango, strawberries, brownie bites, cereal, condenced milk, and red bean.

The cashier was really friendly. I'll be back to try the Crepe Red Velvet and Honey Toast :)"}
{"text":"Great place for some yummy dessert! Unfortunately it's quiet a drive for me so I don't see myself coming here too often but definitely occasionally. Toast, fabulous! So yummy. I can't remember which tea I got but I didn't like it, may of just been what I chose but flavor was a little off to me. Such a cute cafe with nice touches definitely a cool place to grab a dessert and unwind/relax."}
{"text":"Everyone who comes here gets the green tea crepe cake and quite possibly the honey toast - super basic....so I got it and loved it. Both were so delicious! The hot pistachio is also amazing and the decor is super cute."}
{"text":"They are very helpful and they always have tasty sweets everyone can love. Like the small cafe feel!"}
{"text":"This place is the place for deserts my favorite is the green tea cake and the honey toast. I love 45 min away from it and I still drive just to eat a piece of the cake."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was recommended to come try their honey toast & I'm glad I did! I had a honey dew boba as well.. it was soo good. I plan to try their green tea crepe cake next! Its such a cute little caf√©, and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite secret  (now not so secret) dessert spot. The honey toast with strawberries and ice cream and nutella is jist off the chain."}
{"text":"Honey toast is seriously the best thing ever!!! Crunchy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside! It take a little while to come out but definitely worth the wait. It is kind of big, so I recommend sharing it. You get to pick what toppings you want on it and it you want ice cream. Whenever I am in the area I stop by."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this insta worthy place! This place is tricky to find but it's definitely worth the hunt. The outside had such a cute sign and I had to take a picture of it! I also loved how the interior was very well organized. I knew right away that I wanted to try the matcha crepe cake! It was only $6 which I think is not bad for crepe cake cause I know how time consuming it is to make. I also added vanilla ice cream and I have no idea how much extra it was to the overall cake. I was also impressed on how fast I got my crepe cake because there was only one person working behind the counter and there were a few customers. When I finally got my matcha crepe cake with vanilla ice cream, I HAD to take a picture with it. I give the green tea cake a 10/10! It was super light and the vanilla ice cream paired well with it. I also love the strawberries and how well the matcha sauce coincided with the matcha crepe cake and vanilla ice cream. The cake is shareable. However, if you come hungry I'm sure that you can eat it by yourself! I highly recommend this place because of the free wifi and good food. The next time I come here I DEFINITELY want to try the red velvet crepe cake and the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"I love the Honey Toast! Lots of plugs to charge your gear and if you ever wanna throw bones this is a good spot for it! I smashed my Carmel Macchiato, damn good drink! Chill environment and great service, Taki suggested Nutella, strawberry's and ice cream and it changed my life! Minus one star for decor but it is still an awesome spot to chill."}

{"text":"Desserts are amazing here! It is a little bit expensive  for pastries, but I understand why they are. The only reason why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 the cashier was rude. While I was looking at the menu she kept on tapping her fingers against the counter (as a sign to hurry up) but there was no line. Besides her being disrespectful, the other staff members were nice! (Be aware of the tiny Asian girl that has short hair (she's rude to customers))"}
{"text":"One word to describe is sweet would be.. CUTE!
This place is very colorful and vibrant which perfectly matches their beautiful desserts. 

What drew me to this place was the green tea crepe cake. Every time I would come to study here I couldn't resist getting one because it was irresistible delicious. 

Last time I was here I just got the jasmine green tea I believe. Even before I would finish the tea, the lady came around and refilled my tea with hot new water. I thought that was really awesome. Its rare to get service like that in coffee places now a days. 

For studying, this place is a hit or miss. There's a lot of families and big parties who come that can be quite loud. 

For adorable dessert dates, this is a perfect spot!"}
{"text":"I came in today with a friend to study. The ambience was nice with a little background music. Seating was limited because there were around three tables that has not been cleaned off yet. However, there was only one woman working the entire place. We both ordered pots of tea. these were great & extra hot!! just how I like it :) I also ordered the matcha green tea crepe cake. It was delicious. it is very moist, light, and fluffy. The cafe did get loud at some points, so it sometimes was hard to focus. Otherwise, I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Having visited this location a few times it was time to write a review. I absolutely love their honey toast and coffee cake. Their teas and coffee and well made and high quality. The plating and presentation of their food is very pretty and instagram worthy. If you are in the mood for an indulgence I would not hesitate visiting Is Sweet. 

Mom Rating 3/5 

This is a small location with limited seating and is quite small if trying to navigate the space with a stroller. They did not offer high chairs and I don't believe they had a changing table in the bathroom either. The vibe is a bit date night but has a welcoming fast casual vibe as well. If you go during off times with children you should be just fine."}
{"text":"The crepe cakes are so good that we came back two times in one day!! Cute atmosphere to come by and hang out. 
One thing to note is that their drinks are sorry. Both drinks were pretty watered down. Just get the desserts ;)"}
{"text":"The dessert there are really good and they aren't too sweet which is a bonus. I believe that they are mostly known for their crepe cakes. I love going there because the store is just so cute and the designs on each plate are picture worthy."}
{"text":"Me and my friends have gone to Is Sweet countless times in the past month alone. It's a good place to have a drink or dessert while hanging out with friends or just studying alone. I love how cute the atmosphere and decor is. We are all obsessed with the green tea crepe! We get it every single time we go. I also had their honey toast, and I like how they put light honey on it, then have extra honey on the side so it's not overly sweet if you don't want it to be. I wish there were more choices with the drinks because sometimes I just want a regular milk tea, but they still have a good selection of other flavors. I honestly feel like some of their teas and fraps could taste better, but I mainly come here for their desserts. I'm still a fan and will continue to come back. Hopefully I can try the vanilla crepe next time."}
{"text":"My review could more accurately be described as a 3.5 than a 3 star. Is Sweet is not great enough cumulatively for me to rave about, but I would optimistically return for another round or two of Creme br√ªl√©e.  

After searching up Japanese/Asian style patisseries in the area that were open around 2 pm, Is Sweet came up. From the street it's not the easiest to find (is anything, on Spring Mtn Road though?) but I busted a few U Turns for my sweet tooth. There is no large sign outside clearly marking or displaying their banner. 

Parking is decent, and upon entering you are greeted by cutesy chintz furniture that is a bit miniature, and mismatched. Lots of tiny tables and couches to settle around. Cute decor and great lighting, probably a great place for Snapchat pics, who knows. A few well-dressed young Asian women were there already, holding gossipy conversations. 

My friend and I came up and the staff did not greet us, just stopped their conversation, came to the front, and looked up expectantly. The young girl at the front seemed decently friendly taking my order, but the young man acted like he did not get paid enough to do what he did. Probably true. I wish you were paid more, my dude. 

I said hi, perused the selection, then got the iced Taro tea latte, which sounded delicious, but had no descriptors to it. I myself have worked at a place that did a DELICIOUS \"purple Oreo\" smoothie (which was just taro frappe mix, and Oreos, blended), so I had high hopes for this. After looking at their delicious display, I chose to get a creme brulee because I had been having major creme brulee cravings recently. You know, normal things. I also got a slice of beautiful coconut cake to-go for a family member because it looked yummy. 

My friend got the same taro tea latte, but a chocolate cake. The pricing for desserts was typical, kind of expensive, but it looked like their crepes and honey toast were priced better though I didn't get any. Maybe next time!

After taking our orders, we sat down and the girl came by to deliver our beautifully plated desserts and our lattes. I just had to take a photo!   

Because I was excited for them both, I tried the latte first, but was incredibly disappointed! The menu/staff did not warn me that instead of it being a latte (espresso + milk) with taro flavor, it's actually just taro-flavored milk (was there tea in there? As a constant tea-drinker, I highly doubt it, but it's possible it was in there, albeit very weak). I felt like a 5 yr old sipping that milk-flavored taro drink. BIG TRAGIC. 

Next, I broke the surface of the creme brulee. It gave a nice little crack like it was supposed to, and though the sugar coating on it was quite thin it was D E L I C I O U S. I love a good creme brulee, and this place did not disappoint. 

It was very Japanese-y, meaning that besides being beautifully presented, the dessert itself did not overwhelm the taste of the creaminess with too much added sugar. Japanese are all about that delicacy, and I loved every bite. It wasn't a large portion but for the price I'd get it again. 

Partway through my dessert I got up to get a cup of water, which I loved that they had available. Many legitimate Japanese patisseries have cups of water available self-serve on the side, and this place had a cute little corner with the water infused with berries and cucumbers. Ahh, so Japanese. I felt a tad bit like I was back in Japan again. 

We stayed and chatted there for a bit, but the latte disappointed me so much I left it half-full. As someone who absolutely hates waste, I was pretty sad about it. Maybe next time I'll ask them to make me a legit latte and ask to add taro flavor. I don't care how weird it sounds, because of that sad drink I'm determined to get it the better way next time! 

Overall, would return again and ask for espresso in my latte, and maybe try a crepe with my creme brulee."}
{"text":"My 2nd time coming here , and it's such a hidden gem in a corner of Chinatown. Really enjoyed the food, service, atmosphere and the place was very aesthetically pleasing. The desserts and drinks were equally great , with a great variety of choices to pick from . This is definitely a place I would consider coming back in with friends and just relax while having delicious food and drinks"}
{"text":"I've been to Is Sweet a couple of times and I've enjoyed my visit every single time. Recently, I decided to study at Is Sweet (also because I really wanted a cup of their rose hot tea). The location is fairly quiet for reading and studying, unless it gets packed with people but I don't blame them for wanting to visit this cute little cafe. I normally just get their hot teas, which are all fairly priced (a whole tea pot for $5, $2 for a cup). Their rose tea is just loose leaf tea with rose petals, it's both pleasant to smell and to look at. To make your tea even better, you have to order their honey toast! You pretty much build your own, starting at $5 and more depending on the toppings you choose. You can't go wrong though, it's so good and they prepare it thoroughly. Come here on a cute little date with a friend or SO, or come by yourself to catch up with some reading or studying - you'll love it! 

Also, they're also very generous - one of the workers asked if we would like more hot water in our tea pot since we finished it very quickly. Thank you, Is Sweet!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and I love it! The barista was very friendly and helpful with various info, such as discounts and specials. He checked on us after serving our order and anticipated our needs, nice service :)

I ordered the matcha crepe cake with a cappuccino, and it was just the right amount of sweet (delicious!).  It's worth the visit. My only nitpick: the wifi was slow at times.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those tucked away little coffee shops you don't want to tell any of your friends about (if I had friends in Vegas). Your hideaway, sanctuary. A place where you can sit with your mason jar full of iced coffee with a straw (instead of standing awkwardly in the corner somewhere of a crowded Starbucks) and stare into the mountains (seriously, there's a view). 

Ordered the 24oz iced coffee on a weekday afternoon. The one barista working was busy and it took some time for him to get to me but he had a smile on his face the entire time which seemed to just melt any ounce of impatience I had away. I typically down my tall coffees from Starbucks within seconds, so I was pretty happy knowing I still had coffee left after 3 hours of sitting on my bum. 

Didn't order any of the desserts this time around but I definitely have my eyes on that green tea crepe cake. Would really love to try the nutella latte and thai iced tea as well! Note to self: 16oz is plenty."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 10 out of 5 I would. Everything was DELICIOUS! And you're SO getting what you pay for. The vibe is chill with music playing that I didn't expect but it was alllllll my kind of 2000's throwbacks. Service was wonderful and I'm more than positive this will be my new fav little place. 
So many coffee options, so many tea options and the sweets are incredible. My chocolate volcano was the best chocolate milk I've had. The mango tropical dessert was an unexpected love I never knew existed. Perfect combination of mango, ice cream, shaved ice & almonds. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Location: unless you have been here before it's at the very end of establishment. Parking is somewhat easy to find.

Environment: casual cafe with coffee, matcha, red velvet and different variations of latte in accordance with the season. Seating is a bit scattered and inconsistent. Music is your standard top hits more leading towards electronic. 

Food and beverage: I've ordered the red velvet latte before, which had hints of red velvet, with the rest being cream and espresso. Good roast on the americanos. The crepe cakes vary from matcha , red velvet and others. I had the red velvet, very light  simple cream layered crepes. Depending on how long ago they made it can determine how good it really is. Better to have it freshly made. 

Over all analysis: it's a good casual cafe with dessert and coffee, but I think it lacks the attraction. The overall comfort of the place wasn't as cozy to just chat. 3 of 5 because of it doesn't stand out to me as great"}
{"text":"This place was not necessarily great. I got their matcha crepe cake hoping for a matcha crepe cake!! Unfortunately I was totally let down :'( 
The cake was clearly on point with presentation and texture was great however it was very bland and boringgggg- hardly any flavor, it was more like eating a lukewarm green tea with no sweetener (which is obvi not what I ordered) so definitely wouldn't recommend flavor wise. The reason for the 4 stars is for their drinks. Unfortunately I can't remember what drinks I ordered but I had two of their teas (both cold) and two of their coffees (both hot) and they were absolutely delightful! Their ice cream wasn't at all what I expected ..the fruit that comes with the ice cream is like 2 full strawberries and maybe 5 blueberries lol not worth it. Again the drinks were great! I'd definitely go back again to try more of that section of the menu."}
{"text":"Love the Honey Toast!  It was perfect for 107 degree heat in Vegas. Is Sweet is the Bomb! It did not disappoint ! Very nice staff and also fast service and clean! I will go back here again!"}
{"text":"If your craving for honey toast is a 6 on a scale of 1-10 get to IS SWEET and by the time you are done waiting for your honey toast it will be a 9-10. The guy who works here is super nice but they definitely need more than just him working especially on a Friday night. 3 star rating just cos of the long wait."}
{"text":"Is Sweet...is sweet and tasty. Oh. My. My favorite is the green tea crepe cake with the green tea ice cream on the side. Best dessert in the desert. You can't come to Vegas and miss out on this little gem. It'll be the greatest sin you commit! So come. Enjoy. Then order some more! Don't worry I won't tell."}
{"text":"First time here. Staff was very friendly. I came here two hour before closing and they ran out of a lot of things. Very disappointing I wanted to get crepe cake that's why I am giving them 4 star. Other than that the honey toast was really good and the mango smoothie was really good! I would come back for the crepe cake. I suggest coming here early before everything is out or maybe because it was Memorial Day."}
{"text":"Matcha Cake w/ green tea sauce was soooo good! Add ice cream too!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem after waiting in a LONG line at Sweets Raku for them to tell us they are sold out of things!

So we came here at quarter to 11 pm. The girl up front had tons of patience (there were 5 of us) because we'd never been there and we had tons of questions. I loved her! 

Inexpensive!

I got MATCHA CREPE CAKE with STRAWBERRY ICED TEA. The cake was good, as it wasn't too sweet. There was just a hint of sweetness and a full flavor of matcha. The tea was so simple, yet the most satisfying! Tasted fresh, not artificial. Again, just a hint of sweetness. Not overpowered with ice! Perfect drink. 

We also got the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE ICED TEA. The sorbet under the ice cream was very refreshing. It was light, airy, smoothie like. 

The COFFEE CAKE is a MUST TRY! They are genius for this. It is very rich yet melt in your mouth delicious. It has a strong coffee flavor. It's like an edible macchiato. Topped with toffee coated nuts, it's just the most pleasing dessert around! 

We also had HONEY TOAST and SIZZLING BROWNIE. We got the toast with cream and strawberries. It was simple, but flavorful. It was light, but filling, buttery, soft, and addicting! 

FOOD was definitely 5 stars. Everything tasted fresh unlike many dessert places in Vegas that taste artificial and like pure sugar.
SERVICE was 5 stars as well. NOTHING BAD TO SAY!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute dessert cafe, their sweets are always fresh and yummy. I really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall dessert and coffee shop. It has a very cute interior with mismatched chairs and tables that give off a more cozy vibe. Gotta try their honey toasts and the crepe cakes! Nice for date night or hangout with friends."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this cute little spot during my visit to Vegas. They are turning out some pretty amazing desserts . I ordered the the sweet toast with Nutella , strawberry and Bananas along with condensed milk (Amazing ) . We also ordered the Red Velvet crepe cake which yummy . They are about 5 miles from the strip and located in a small strip mall. They have this cute little set up of odd shaped chairs and tables nothing really matches which makes it have its own unique taste which I like kind of remind Central Perk from Friends . So if you happen to be in the area give this place a try it's pretty amazing"}
{"text":"I have been here about a half dozen time this past 2months. Found about this place through my friend. It was hard to find but worth the search, in the same plaza with a Vietnamese Rest. 

Most times I come across Maya a sweet and friendly cashier and barista who is knowledgeable and makes great recommendation. A few of my favorites items at this shop is their crepe cakes, a must try for anyone and get it with a scoop of ice cream. They have a wide variety of topping for their waffles and honey toast which I think keeps it interesting and refreshing.  Cool place to chill and enjoy with anybody plus a great central location in Vegas."}
{"text":"The ambiance was good, open space, people come to study here & a good place to have coffee talks over some dessert as well. This place sure owns up to its name! People who have a sweet tooth should try this place out and cross it of the bucket list. The red velvet crepe cake was really delicious combined with a dab of strawberry syrup enhances the flavor. We also love our coffees in the mason jar mugs! The Nutella frappe is another way to complement a mocha flavored ice blend coffee. Each item has a fair price around $6. Service is fast and they bring it to your table so people don't have to crowd around the counter. The place is pretty small but sure provides personal space for groups."}
{"text":"This is a good dessert places. The decor is adorable and nice. Against the back wall they have a red brick wall which is cute. They have mini tables as well as regular ones. They also have free wifi if you want to study here.  The service is good, everyone is very polite and helpful. They don't rush you if you are unsure on what to order.

We usually get the crepe cake and honey toast. I prefer their crepe cake over their honey toast. It does take a little longer to make the honey toast, so make sure you guys have time to wait. Their presentation is amazing. I always order their matcha crepe cake. They have layers of thing crepe cake stack on top of each other. They have this matcha sauce to pour over the cake and it is amazing. The cake is sweet but not over powering."}
{"text":"I came here towards the end of summer break to enjoy  some sweets with good company. (I know it's super late, but better late than never!) I would have given one more star but my friend and I walked in to be greeted with nothing but a hot, muggy store. This being Vegas and all, summer without AC=miserable. They opened up the doors eventually to let in some air.

I ordered an iced caramel machiato and a green tea crepe cake. The coffee was nothing special but I really enjoyed my cake! One good thing about Asian bakeries, in my opinion, is that the desserts are never overly sweet. I was able to taste the green tea without it being hidden behind sugar. The presentation is super cute too. My friend custom ordered honey toast with berries, pocky and a bunch of other toppings and a custom coffee as well. The worker was kind enough to make her a second drink in case she didn't like the first. We both thought the honey toast was good but we had to eat the ice cream part pretty fast due to the heat. 

I know there wasn't really anything they could do about the AC but regardless of that, their customer service was great. The food was good and I would definitely give this place another visit!"}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful surprise!  Was craving something sweet and found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.  We ordered the matcha crepe cake ,chocolate cake and the coconut lava honey toast.  The desserts  were amazing!  I loved the matcha crepe cake, the flavor was very mild but very rich and creamy.  The honey toast was so delicious! I've never had anything like it! Warm coconut custard inside toasted bread with vanilla ice cream. I didnt get a chance to try the chocolate cake because my son inhaled it. If you are in the mood for a different kind of dessert experience I recommend IS SWEET!"}
{"text":"Preface: I rarely give out 1 stars. When I do, it really means something went terrible and disturbed me. 

Stopped by here with some friends on a weeknight to study.. because what else do medical students do but study right? 

I will give credit where credit is due. Is Sweet is indeed a sweet place to get a drink, dessert, and yes, study. Good drinks (I had a strawberry slushie) and the desserts also looked good. It really had great potential to become my new favorite study spot!

About 2 hours in, me and my friends were approached by the cashier and was told (not asked) that he needed our table because a large group 'coming in'...... He followed up suggesting we could move to a smaller table if we wanted. ?!?! (There were also no empty tables at the time when he told us to move)

Now, I've been to my fair share of cafes of all kinds and NEVER NEVER NEVER have I been told I need to give up my seat to make room for a bigger party (aka more $$$) Yes, a cafe is a business and business is business, but how is this the way to treat your customers?

Sorry to the bigger party, but could they not have gotten their drinks to go? Or sat separately?

To be fair, he came over one more time when we were packing up and offered to put some tables together for us. I was already in a sour mood and wanted to get out of there already. Didn't even finish my slushie. :(

We confronted the waiter about it afterwards and there was back and forth arguing that I would rather not get into. 

Bottom line, my experience was a big no no in my book. I am very glad that others have had positive experiences here. I really was enjoying myself up until we were told to move or leave. As always, this was just my experience and I hope everyone has a better one!"}
{"text":"Cute cozy spot for a chilling day. The cakes are up to my taste - not too sweet . Their coffee is strong and tastes like real coffee. (I hate places like Starbucks honestly because their coffee is too fancy and tastes nothing like what coffee is supposed to be.) Baristas (whom I assumed are more like biz partners) are very friendly and accommodating. They try to adjust their coffee to fit the taste of customers. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Hello Kitty cake in Las Vegas !

I was so excited to get a slice and have my sister help me finish it!  I also showed her photos of the Bear cake, coconut cake, and Red Velvet...

However, when we got there at around 10pm, they were all sold out.

Instead, we shared the Matcha Green Tea Crepe Cake, the Chocolate Volcano drink, and the Strawberry Cheesecake Shave ice.  Yumm!  Sugar overload!

On my next visit to Vegas, Dear Daniel and Minky went with me to make another attempt for the Hello Kitty cake... there was none.  Maybe It was sold out again?  Arg!  

Since we were there, I got the Creme Brulee... it was a great snack because it tied me over until our next meal!

Thanks to Monica, Daniel, and Minky for supporting my Hello Kitty addiction...Haha!  Guess I'll have to try again?  Thank goodness the parking is free...LOL!"}
{"text":"IS Sweet is a casual Asian dessert cafe in the heart of Chinatown. Although there are plenty of these types of cafes in Southern California, IS Sweet is one of a kind here in Vegas. Much like the decor, their desserts are playful, often featuring bears or Hello Kitty atop their cakes. In addition to the standard flavored iced teas, milk teas, and coffee, they have desserts such as honey toast, waffles, and crepe cakes. My favorite is a slice of the matcha green tea crepe cake with green tea sauce to top it off. I love how light and airy it is. 

If you're looking for something more refreshing, they are running a special during the summer with shaved snow. The tropical mango shaved snow features shaved mango with pieces of fresh mango topped off with a scoop of mango ice cream and mango sauce. Did I mention it had mango? The price is steeper than most of the other desserts at $10, but it's also meant to be shared between 2-3 people (I ended up devouring most of it myself). I have yet to try their tiramisu, chocolate cake, or NY cheesecake. 

The presentation of all their desserts (on wooden boards) and drinks (in mason jars) are social media-worthy, especially with their tables and seating. It's also a nice place to hang out with friends, with plenty of seating and free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, with awesome service and a welcoming atmosphere! Can't wait to come back. I highly recommend the honey toast!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the hype on social media about this place I was very disappointed :( 

-I ordered the famous green tea crepe & it tasted okay. 

-To drink I ordered the ice caramel macchiato because it look yummy on some other people's yelp pictures. When I received it, it was in a to go cup vs the mason jars (wasn't like the pictures) and it was very strong. 

-It's not a very big place so we were a party of 5 + 1 kid and had no where to sit :( they had to move these different sizes table for us. 

-Temperate was very hot inside. 

Over all maybe I'll give another chance but was very disappoint."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times for one reason: HONEY TOAST. 

We thought we had experienced honey toast before, but not untile we came here. The honey toast is almost a full loaf of bread, buttered and grilled and then cubed, but still intact. They layer whatever you'd like on top of it, but we stick with vanilla ice cream. On top of the ice cream, they drizzle honey all over. The ice cream is cold, the honey toast is warm and the honey perfectly sweet - all in your mouth all at the same time, it's phenomenal. 

They also make a fantastic latte. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great customer service! 5 stars!!!! This place is very low key, love how peaceful it is. Excellent dessert!!!!! Def will be back! Love the staff! Great coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"I will recommend going to this place because it has the best honey-toast in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great tasting desserts.  The restaurant is small but adds to the charm and cozy atmosphere.  Try the butter toast!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times and each time it always hits the spot. I bring everyone I know here, especially when I know they have a huge sweet tooth. 

This hole-in-the-wall spot is located on Spring Mountain in between Lindell and Decatur next to Viet Noodle Bar all the way in the back! 

Here are what I've tried so far: 

- Matcha crepe cake: light and tasty. It has the perfect amount of matcha in it. I love the sauce that comes with it!!! 
- Red Velvet Crepe Cake: my favorite. 
- Vanilla Crepe Cake: My least favorite of the crepe cakes but it's still delicious if you want something simple. 
- Strawberry & Kiwi Honey Toast w/ Strawberry Drizzle & Ice Cream: HUGE dessert that's great to share with 3-4 people. The toast is warm, crunchy and tastes amazing with any topping you pick. You can put as many toppings as you'd like so go ham w/ it. Enjoy the honey toast while it's nice and warm. Takes about 20 mins to make since they make it to order. 
- Chocolate Brownie w/ Ice Cream: Yummmm 
- Peppermint Tea (Excellent for colder nights. I recommend getting a pot to share w/ friends) 

You can order a bunch of desserts to enjoy. None of them are overly sweet. It's always the perfect balance. They also have tiramisu and other desserts to try as well! IS Sweets adds new items all the time so keep a lookout! 

The place gets packed quickly since it's small so be prepared to either sit outside or get your dessert to go if you come here on a Friday or Saturday night. Still tastes great even if you get it to go! 

Price is reasonable. Each dessert is roughly $7-9 depending on how much you tip. 

Absolutely LOVE this place. Each time I come the experience is great. Service is phenomenal. Food and teas are delicious. For sure a 5 out of 5! 

Happy Dining, 
JT"}
{"text":"This place is cute and spacious. Many tables and chairs for people to study and talk, plus there are cute decor to look at. 

Creme br√ªl√©e (4/5)- Really like the crispy top but the inside isn't as creamy. Overall a good dessert. 

Honey toast w/ strawberries&ice cream (4/5)- I like how the toast is pretty big. The outside was toasty and the inside was soft. The ice cream with the honey syrup was a bit too sweet though. Next time, I'll just get fruit since it's already sweet enough."}
{"text":"Such a cozy place! They also have free wifi if you want to study with your friends in here. My boyfriend and I always ordered Vanilla crepes when we come here. So today we got a Tiramisu and Creme Br√ªl√©e for something new. The Tiramisu taste as good as they look. However, the Creme Br√ªl√©e too creamy and sweet. We are still coming back for another dessert!"}
{"text":"I should have ordered an iced tea or something like that to go with my coconut cake, but the sign for the chocolate volcano, billed as a summer drink, was very enticing.

I took my receipt and had a seat.  The place was quiet when I was there about 7:30 PM on a weekday.  Shortly, a server brought my cake and a bit later, she brought my volcano.  Carb overload.  Is Sweet was sweet. 

The cake was OK.  It was a little dry.  I didn't ask if the bakery items are made in house but my guess is that they are not.  Presentation of the cake on a wooden platter was nicely done.

Then came the chocolate volcano.  It's a frapp√© that very thick, very rich with a ton of chocolate flavor, and then topped with chocolate powder for an extra chocolate kick.

I will stop in again but I'll make sure if I get a pastry that I'll get a more reasonable drink or just stick with water.

There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Great dessert place. I've ordered the Thai milk tea and honey toast. Super yummy! Only downside about the honey toast is that it takes a while, but worth it"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere. Very cute and cozy. However, it can get pretty busy in here and although there's many chairs to sit on, it can be hard to find a table to sit at. 

The honey toast is amazing. That's the one thing I will repeatedly order from here. It's warm and soft. It's pretty large...enough to share with another person. The crepe cakes aren't bad either. I liked the vanilla and green tea crepe cakes...very light and not too sweet. I wasn't too fond of their red velvet crepe cake. 

The service is always great. The first time I came here with my family, we had no idea what to get. The lady at the register was patient and sweet. She was knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer all of our questions. Another time, I came here with my sister specifically for their coffee cake. But they were sold out. We were disappointed about going home empty-handed, but they offered to call her to let her know when they had it again and said they'd set aside a piece (or in her case...THREE pieces) for her to pick up. They called her later on that day. That was so nice of them!"}
{"text":"I personally don't like writing reviews, but I think caf√© is worth writing one for. I've gone a few times before and the experience and service is great. The caf√© itself is very clean and gives a good vibe from the moment you enter. The menu isn't very different from other caf√©s but it isn't as expensive as others. So that's a plus if you want some good drinks that won't kill your wallet. Anyways, I haven't really tried much other than what's become my usual drink, thai milk tea. I wasn't a fan of thai milk tea until I came here. Second, the honey toast is amazing in my opinion. The good thing about this caf√© right now is that if you but a cake or toast and a drink you get 10% discount which isn't much, but it's pretty good! Overall, I would give it 5 stars but they do sometimes take a while. I would recommend coming here by yourself or with company! The workers are great and friendly."}
{"text":"Cute cafe with lots to offer, including desserts, drinks and free wifi!

I come here to study a lot because it's the perfect place to study with its ample seating and wifi, plus they are open until midnight. It's also a good place to catch up with a friend. Their interior is Instagram-worthy and has lots of personality. They even have a small patio seating outside, unfortunately you only get a view of parking and apartment complex next door but is still nice to enjoy the fresh air.

 A worker here told me their crepes are most popular dessert. They have the option of matcha, vanilla and red velvet. I have tried matcha and vanilla and have to say their matcha is my favorite. Crepe has multiple layers and looks beautiful. Texture is super creamy and velvety. Vanilla crepe came with a chocolate ice cream on the side and even with the same creamy texture, it didn't taste like vanilla.

As far as drinks goes, my most favorite is their iced chocolate. It's basically a hot chocolate poured over ice. It was so good my friend had finished her's in 5 min LOL

Lychee green tea is good if you want something refreshing, but make sure to ask for less sweet. 

On one visit, a worker told me I can mix the flavors and that his favorite drink here is the strawberry lychee green tea. I asked for less sweet and it still came out really sweet. I enjoyed the small lychee pulp inside. 

Service can be a little faster. They are friendly so I won't complain too much. I often see dirty dishes piling on tables which is not a good sign for me. I'm still coming back for their delicious drinks and desserts :-)"}
{"text":"I came here when bakery first opened which was at 1 pm. Its a small coffee shop that you would never knew existed. I was amped about trying the hello kitty cake. The bakery case is extremely small. Maybe about 5 types of dessert total. I asked for hello kitty cake, but was told it wouldnt be there until \"later\". Ithen attempted to order the green tea cake slice and was told it can be made to go. The other bakery items did not appeal to me, so I figured I just try a smoothie or boba- they dont have that either. So I left emoty handed. I dont think I will return. Not much to offer and awkward small location."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. I love there presentation. And taste yummy. I will be going back.  Can't wait to try more things."}
{"text":"Great desserts and really good coffee... must try honey toast and pistachio latte!  It is centrally located and open late so it's a good spot to go after dinner"}
{"text":"What a great dessert and coffee place! Located in a small complex right by Cazino, you'll see on the sign for the complex it says ABC and is sweet is located in he back. First of all, I love how open the area feels. So much natural light, there is seating outside, love it. The seating inside is cute! The menu above the cashier only says the drinks, look for the paper menu and it has the desserts. We ordered the matcha green crepe cake, side of green tea ice cream, raspberry crepe cake. The display of the dessert was really nice, it was flavorful, I like matcha being more on the sweet side so I feel like it could've been sweeter but it was still good none the less. Prices were not bad at all. Definitely a great spot to check out if you need something sweet"}
{"text":"Adorable hole in the wall in China town. There's a lot of dessert places in China town but I feel like they go out of their way to serve quality food. The presentation is amazing and the price isn't bad at all. This place is easily my go-to place for dessert or to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"IS Sweet is such a cute little tea, coffee, and dessert spot. I truly believe we eat with our eyes first and everything is presented beautifully-it's all picture and social media worthy! My one complaint or recommendation is to figure out a way to increase their seating. Their seating is pretty limited which I can see posing an issue as they get more and more popular. 

My sister, niece, and I stopped in for dessert after lunch somewhere else. Located at the end of a small plaza this space has lots of natural lighting and some unique decor. It's very whimsical and vintage looking. There's about 6 tables with seating for 2-6. They serve cups and pots of tea, different coffees and lattes, and a handful of desserts. They had different cakes and even an almost make your own honey toast option where you can pick toppings and sauces.

Today we tried their green tea crepe cake, tiramisu, Nutella bear cake, and a taro latte. Everything was plated super cute, had a little wow factor, but most importantly was tasty and affordable. My favorite item we got was the  taro latte with the crepe cake with added ice cream on the side. The latte wasn't very sweet at all and honestly tasted like taro and milk but was so refreshing.

This place was super cute, all their items we tried were not overly sweet, and the pricing was right. I'll definitely be back to try their honey toast.

Update: stopped by a second day in a row and tried their pistachio latte and a strawberry cheese cake shaved ice that was to die for! Perfect for the vegas heat."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Had a great green tea latte (or I think they call it matcha milk tea). I loved the strong matcha flavor! Heavily sweetened, so definitely more dessert-y than coffee shop-y. The little ones were with me and opted for a red velvet frappe. IS SWEET. But still good. If I were by myself, I would definitely try one of the other, not so sweet flavors. The kids loved it, of course, especially with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top.
Wow, those 2 drinks were pretty filling, but I figured I'm not in Chinatown that often, better go for the signature honey toast. I make honey toast at home myself, but it's actually just a piece of toasted bread with country crock and honey on top. So imagine that, gourmeted and freshened up. Yum. The \"toast\" is very thick and kinda airy - more like a waffle than bread, I would say. They offer a huge selection of toppings, so we went with the cashier's recommendation of nutella, vanilla ice cream, and fruit (blueberries). It was good, but sooo sweet and over the top, after we just had a couple sweet drinks. If I were to go again, I might just get a plain honey toast or sample one of the other kinds of desserts they had in the display case. 
Even though there are lots of coffee and tea drinks to choose from, this is not a coffee shop. Especially considering they don't even open til noonish.
If it were closer to my house, I might actually be a regular, but at this location, I'll probably only be back on special occasions or to bring out of town visitors."}
{"text":"What a great little boutique dessert joint Is Sweet is..definitely now a fan.

Is Sweet Desserts: All the desserts we tried looked fun but were also tasty as well.  The crepe cakes I've tried were flavorful but not overwhelmingly sweet. My favorite is the matcha crepe cake.  The strawberry cake topped with a Hello Kitty candy head is cute but tastes great as well.  All the coffees have been quality and ice cream desserts have been solid and always served with fresh fruit.

Is Sweet ambiance:  Service has always been quick even on occasions where they have been packed.  Decorated with a boutique coffee house vibe that has one wall lined with a red brick wallpaper makes for a fun sit down.  Tables and seats are limited to about 30 people, very quaint.

Is Sweet makes the most kawaii desserts in the city.  This makes Is Sweet very popular social media wish and is free advertising for them.  The great thing is that they also deliver on taste.  This is my go to dessert joint on Spring Mountain Road and I'll keep posting pics after more visits.  enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem! Thanks to a friend I was able to find this little Cafe in the back. It's pretty much impossible to see IS SWEET when driving down the street so I'm glad to see them doing well. Staff is very friendly, the shop itself is cute and welcoming, Decided to sit outside even though it was cold, and we had a thought it would be nice to have a small miniature fireplace out there for when it's cold. Also the lady came out in the cold to deliver what we ordered. Thank you! =) 

On to the dessert, it was very sweet (of course), I expected the green tea crepe cake to be warm, as if it was straight off the griddle. It was cold or rather cool but still very delicious. The texture was soft and \"melting-like,\" very satisfying. Also ordered was honey toast. Everywhere else I've ordered this came with vanilla ice cream, as they didn't add any. We were 100% okay with this since the weather circumstances. Boy was the honey toast great! Warm, super soft on the inside, with semi crunchy crust makes great honey toast. 

Highly recommend this place to anyone with a sweet tooth or craving dessert after dinner. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"DELISH!!!! The two items I tried here were sooo delicious! 

The red velvet crepe cake was very light and airy that it has a mousse like texture and it wasn't too sweet.  I think I could eat a whole cake by myself. The raspberry sauce that came as a side with the cake was also tasty. It wasn't too tart and added a nice extra flavor to the cake. 

The honey toast with strawberries, mangoes and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was unexpectedly good! I have tried other honey toasts and didn't care for them so I only ordered it because my friend wanted to try it. I am happy she did! The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and not dry like most places. It didn't even taste like bread, almost like a sponge cake instead.  The mangos and strawberries were fresh. 

The place is quite small and you would miss it if you didn't know about it since the building it was located in is perpendicular to Spring Mountain.  It's a cute place though with an emphasis on rustic decor. The guy taking our order was friendly and had recommendations for us as far as what to do with our ice cream choices."}
{"text":"Cute dessert and tea shop hidden in the back! It is in the same center as the Viet Noodle Bar. It took me a few rounds before finding it. Their honey toast is made perfectly with your own choice of toppings! They also have a variety of desserts such as strawberry cheesecakes, matcha crepecakes, chocolate mousse, etc."}
{"text":"I got the honey toast with Nutella, strawberries, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream. It was the BOMB!!!!! Ima go there eeerrrrday!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! I love how the drinks and food are presented to you.My bf and I had the matcha frappe and a hazelnut frappe.The matcha frappe is very delicious. Definitely a must try! The hazelnut was pretty good too. You can taste the coffee in it. Overall, I felt their products are great! Will come back to try the crepe dessert.


The only thing I noticed was the place was short staffed. There was literally one young asian boy working the food and the cashier!! Theres so many customers waiting and were a bit upset for the long wait. I literally waited at least 20 min for a frappe. I was about to leave but I didn't want to feel rude.. I understand the shop is small, but the two times I've been here its been packed. Plus its Friday night! Definitely need to step up on the staff. No customer wants a long wait. 



Poor kid, he looked so stressed and rushed. He better get a fat check for working so hard. He also gave great customer service."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has the best honey toast.  Omg...we loved it.  We had a craving and went at 10:30 pm as YELP has it listed as closing at midnight.  To our disappointment it was closed tho. :-(  u won't see this place from spring mt.  It's in the back near the covered parking.  The guy is nice too and remembers me...I guess it's not that nice when I'm a tourist coming straight days.  Drinks are good too.  I had a Nutella Frappe.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Had me at graduation ! Wonderful customer service. I went after my grad ceremony with my friends and the worker made me a special grad present. I was so surprised. Thank youuuu"}
{"text":"Is review about specific items. Is important to pay attention.

IS SWEET is relatively new dessert shop in the back of the Viet Noodle Bar plaza. Is open until midnight; is why we went here after dinner ended late.

Is menu with many typos. Is not so professional for that reason.

Is pretty good honey toast ($4). Is more expensive with toppings, ice cream especially being important for texture ($1.25), strawberry ($1) nice too. Is very good overall. Is not sickeningly sweet.

Is also good jasmine tea ($5 for a pot). Is hot and is strong jasmine flavor. Is also complimentary lemon-infused water at condiment/utensil/napkin counter on the side.

Is place with many other desserts and drinks. Is probably worth returning to try other items."}
{"text":"Delicious desssseerrrttttsss! I will try their creme br√ªl√©e next and a new drink! Thank you for my first time experience!"}
{"text":"Should definitely try it once. I seen a lot of friends coming here and thought I'd give it a try.  Probably wouldn't come back. In deed was tasty. But to sweet on the other hand to finish. And pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Nope. I felt bad because my parents were in town from New York and they wanted some coffee and dessert after the show we attended. I wanted to impress them with a hidden gem however this is maybe the first or second time I've ever been steered wrong by Yelp reviews. The second I walked in I felt totally awkward. Literally like a kid in high school walking into the school cafeteria for the first time. While the employees were not outright rude to me or my mother.. they did not welcome us, make any sort of suggestion, or even ask the basic what can I get started for you today. Instead they looked at us like we legit had 3 heads which left me totally confused and feeling like I'd done something wrong like I came in during the final five mins of them being open and placed some ridiculous order. 

Their Red Velvet Frappe wasn't bad, but honestly if you're looking for a Red Velvet frappe to knock your socks off.. go to MadHouse coffee instead. I also had creme br√ªl√©e, I didn't like it. My mom tried it and she thought it was gross. My dad basically looked at us both and said I'm not gonna have it go to waste and ate it.. 

I will not return nor recommend."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and the presentation was wonderful; however, my drink was way too sweet even with my extra shot of expresso. My milk toast was dry and stale. I had probably 10 blueberries....all for a total of $18. Completely over priced. I did not drink half of my coffee and ate only the center of my toast."}
{"text":"Excellent desserts! I recommend to try the honey toast with chocolate and ice cream! So delicious and worth trying when coming here."}
{"text":"Such a cute place, their food presentation is my favorite it makes you not wanna eat it and just take pictures of it! Lol. Such big portions too it's great. 4 stars because the background music was loud I couldn't concentrate on my study but will def come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend told me about this place when she saw some IG posts. The green tea crepe drew me in, and then their drinks!

Their drinks are in little cute mason jars, and their drink selections are pretty wide! 

The presentation of their food is definitely worth the picture to wow your friends. 

This place is a must go when you are in the area!

They have exceeded my expectations :)"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with various pastries and drinks on offer. 

Can't advise much on drinks, as I pretty much stick to black coffee,  but the bannofee pie is yum.

Out of their selection of crepe cakes, I think the best is the green tea. Not too sweet, just make sure you use all the green tea syrup it comes with. Regardless of what you choose, everything comes out looking amazing.  They put so much care in presentation,  it's perfect for all you instagrammers out there!"}
{"text":"Danggggg.... This place is super chill. 


The honey toast ..... Orgasmic.... Don't be cheap on toppings , go crazy. 

Best part order their authentic bottles of water :)"}
{"text":"Coffee was delicious! Cute little spot, totally unexpected on the location and was a little tricky finding it. We had the honey toast and it was delicious, perfect companion with our coffees."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I visited this adorable shop!  It has a chill vibe with cute decor and yummy treats. I loved my honey toast and Taro smoothie. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Mmm soo yummy! I don't typically go out of my way to get desserts and sweets but my boyfriend brought me here after dinner one night. We ordered the sizzling chocolate brownie  yum!! Comes with this little chocolate sauce to pour of the top of the skillet and it sizzles, super chocolatey, and topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced almonds. Paired up with a vanilla latte (perfect because it wasn't too sweet) and he got the caramel macchiato. They were busy and steady the whole time we were there but the service was quick. And good prices. Happy we stopped in! It's all the way to the back of the parking lot tucked in, just a small little cafe. I'd recommend it for a dessert and coffee with friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

I thought it was good but not oh my goodness I need to go back. The honey toast was definitely the winner out of the 2. It was a full house and it took about 10 minutes to get our desserts and coffee. I didn't add ice cream to the honey toast as I had figured that the condensed milk would be sweet enough. Sure enough the sweetness was sweet but not overly sweet. The red velvet crepe cake was very very sweet. You know me. I love sweets but if it's too sweet I can't eat it. Overall, I would come back if my favorites weren't open which another dessert place is closed on Wednesdays. It's a bit hidden so if you miss the turn you will need to make a u turn. Service was good, but if you're looking for a large group to eat dessert with, there's not much sitting room."}
{"text":"Another nice little dessert spot in town. Came here for Honey toast and Mango snow fluff multiple occasion. Staff here pretty nice and very helpful. If you in a hurry this place might not be for you. Overall will be back! (they got free WiFi as well MOBILE LEGEND!!!!!)"}
{"text":"I came here for one thing only. The green tea crepe cake. I was on a mission to eat my most missed crepe cake from California at Lady M Cake Boutique. 

Ohhhhh, was I disappointed. The color of the green was off the bat TOO GREEN. The sauce that you pour on top was a bit strange. IT's okay. The crepe cake itself was nothing to get excited about. 

I bow down my head low and head back to my search for crepe cake in vegas...tears."}
{"text":"You're probably wondering if the food tastes as good as the presentation makes it look. YES. 
IS SWEET is in the back of an already unknown plaza on Spring Mountain. The restaurant is small and filled with mismatched couches and tables. You can either say it has an antique feel to it or say it looks worn down. Your choice. 
The crepe cakes are not on the main board menu (small board off to the side - $4.50). The matcha crepe cake (or mirufiiyu in Japan) has the true bitter matcha taste. None of that over sweetened stuff from Starbucks they call matcha! The honey toast has a cheap initial price of $4.50 but it adds up once you start adding your toppings. Strawberry icecream and bananas are my favorite combo. Nutella is too strong of a flavor and kills the buttery taste of the toast. Leave the nutella for something else! 
The ice coffee was decent. Everything is served in a mason jar. 
 If you're trying to capture the perfect picture of your food come during the day and sit at the tables closest to the window ;) The lighting is IG worthy!"}
{"text":"Is sweet is a cute cafe that offers coffee and desserts. They provide free wifi and a fun casual atmosphere to gather with friends and family, or bring your laptop and get some work done. The cafe has a fun ambiance with string lights, brick walls, and soothing jazz music. We tried the matcha green tea crepe cake with green tea ice cream, red velvet crepe cake with vanilla ice cream, and the Nutella honey toast. My favorite was the red velvet crepe cake hands down. It tasted much fresher than the matcha. the Nutella honey toast is delicious as well, it is a big portion so I recommend sharing it with a friend."}
{"text":"It's a very cute shop! I think the price is a little too high. But overall the crepe cake and honey toast are good."}
{"text":"I'm always down for sweets! and this is the place to be. Nice place in Chinatown that offers coffee and desserts! Their desserts are very good and good looking. Tried the red velvet crepe cake and the honey toast, they had the perfect sweetness to my taste! It was a wait of 10-15 minutes, it was somewhat busy. You get 10% off 1 drink with yelp check in."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when I was searching places with a good matcha dessert, so I decided to drag my boyfriend with me here.
We had some trouble finding this place (the directions on Uber were wrong), but were pleasantly surprised when we finally found it! Cute decor and a decently sized seating area. 
Because I am a matcha fanatic, I decided to get the matcha crepe cake with green tea ice cream and an iced green tea latte. My boyfriend got honey toast with condensed milk, strawberries and strawberry ice cream and an iced taro tea latte. The drinks took a few minutes. My green tea latte was amazing, but the taro tea was a little powdery, but still good. Not too sweet. The crepe cake came out next. It was beautiful, and my boyfriend and I spent quite a few minutes taking pictures of it and a video of me pouring on the matcha sauce over it. The cake itself was delicious! It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but wasn't an overload of sweetness. The green tea ice cream they used was my favorite part about it though...I wonder what brand of ice cream it was? Whatever it was, it was one of the best green tea ice creams I've ever had. Just as we were finishing my crepe cake, my boyfriends honey toast came out. It was beautiful as well, and the guy working also gave us a side cup of condensed milk in case we wanted extra. It was amazing. The toast was perfectly warm and crispy on the edges. The strawberry pieces tasted fresh and sweet. Definitely worth the price for it. 
Will definitely be coming back to try the coffee and other desserts!"}
{"text":"Great green tea crepe cake. Not too sweet. The brock toast like dessert takes a while to come out so order first. All their desserts are very artsy. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, this place IS SWEET

Very difficult to find which makes this place even more alluring once you finally find it.  It's in the plaza right before the jade/ramen area.  You'll pass by a few law firms and an acupuncture clinic before you find it nestled as the very last building. 

Until 04/30th there is a promotion going on for buy one get one 50% or 30% with a yelp or facebook check in.

Setting: Very cute and they did a good job at going for the coffee shop fad that is going on now. The music playing is your typical bon iver type radio station that isn't on too loud like it is at serenade or cafe darak. There are plenty of places to sit which accommodate mostly couples but there is a large that fits six.  Another highlight of this place is the amount of outlets available. This store definitely took the effort to install outlets to help techies like me stay charged.

Service: The female manager was very kind and delivered a convincing story to her coffee shop. Basically, \"We don't serve drinks that we don't like,\" which makes total sense.  Why conform when you should create a product you yourself would want to buy?

Drink: I got the hazelnut frappe which could have been blended better but it was still good.

Overall: A great place nestled far enough from the roads of spring mountain while on spring mountain.  Nice place to get some work done on a nice afternoon or to just spend some quality time with a good friend and/or significant other."}
{"text":"Small cafe featuring the usual flavored teas, espresso drinks and desserts.  Nothing really exceptional about this place, but pictures and distance helped.  

While walking at night in Vegas can kill you(due to horrible don't-give-a-fuck-drivers-who-will-hit-n-run-til-smear-no-longer-impeads-drivability)... It seemed fitting after my newfound contentment in staying alive and a phenomenal dinner experience.   Anyways, walking still made sense if we were about to add a ginormous amount of sugar, not normally in our diets... anymore.  When i posted \"dark chocolate quinoa for Cheat Day...\"  I was taunted to do better.  or worse, actually.  Challenge accepted.  

Do:

THAI TEA LAVA HONEY TOAST- I've seen many of these walk past me, but not today mutherfucker, not today.  Indulgence!  Thankfully, this was shared.  Hot, molten, thai tea lava melted the generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream in the volcano cube of perfectly toasted bread.  A third member of this crew would've been helpful.  I wouldn't have eaten so much of it.  

Located at back of strip mall, signage is bright and large for my squinty mole eyes to see from street.  Ample shared parking.  Two restrooms for such a small place is great, but how about stocking some paper towels?  C'mon man!"}
{"text":"The desserts were delish! I ordered the green tea crepe and honey toast with condensed milk and nutella. I love how how you can make so many different combinations with the honey toast. :) It was like tasting heaven and I wish they were a little closer to me. I also got honeydew milk tea and it was good, but a little too sweet. The tea had ice but, it wasn't chill enough to me. Great desserts and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here for dessert after eating out in Chinatown. The honey toast is amazing and you can customize it to your tasting. I usually get some sort of coffee drink here and it's always good. The coffee is not too acidic or strong that it needs a lot of sugar or cream. All other drinks are delicious as well. Definitely a must go to get your sweet tooth fixed!"}
{"text":"Very hipster coffee and dessert place. Good music and great dessert!! Detailed presentation of the food. Really love the interior decoration as well. 

Try their crepe cake!!"}
{"text":"I can see how this place is popular. Most people come here for the brick/honey toast and crepe cakes, and for the brick/honey toast, you can choose different toppings. You can read all about the crepe cakes and brick/honey toast in pretty much every other review of Is Sweet. Nothing super new or novel on that aspect.

I come here to study since they're open pretty late, the wi-fi is good, and the environment is pretty quiet/peaceful. They have their busy moments when people come in to sit and chit chat with friends over some desserts, but for the most part, it's quiet and intimate. During the day, there's a lot of natural light which is nice for studying/working or the occasional instagram shot.

I usually get hot tea here since it's reasonably priced ($5 for the whole pot). They will also refill your pot with more hot water when you run out which is nice when I'm studying here for a while.

The customer service is good. They're always really nice and inviting when I come here which is a plus.

Overall, it's a nice place to study with decent desserts and cute presentation."}
{"text":"For years now I have been attempting to try a crepe cake.  One of the other local eateries used to be one of the few that offered this elusive delicacy, but every time I tried in vain to    finally try it they ran out.   Then within my yelp feed, Is Sweet  appeared, promising me a new hope of completing this goal that had almost become but a dream. 

On an amazingly hot day after ending up on this side of town, I made my move and headed up spring mountain on my conquest.  It was in the same shopping center as Viet noodle bar,  and was tucked all the way at the end.  They have outside seating for days that won't sear  your eyelashes off,  and upon entering they had an assortment of couches, nice chairs,  and more traditional small table areas. They have a selection of different beverages and other desserts likes coconut cake,  tirimisu etc but I had my eye on the prize for their crepe cake. The matcha green tea flavor to be exact...and they were not out! So happy! They give an option to adding ice cream,  however I first wanted to try it on its own. 


After placing my order I wanted to sit in one of the cool squishy chair areas, but no one bused that table yet, so we found a spot by the wall. There was a spot where you could serve yourself lemon water if you don't purchase one of their many refreshments like me.   

When the cake was brought out I was surprised how large is was. Layer after layer of crepe with whipped cream between the layers,  and a small container to pour the matcha sauce all over it.   There was also some fresh fruit which involved a cut up strawberry, two cherries,  and an orange slice and what tasted like a cherry sauce drizzled in the plate.   The cherry sauce helped create a good acid contrast to the mellow sweet matcha and whipped cream flavors.   The strawberries paired nicely,  but the cherries were way tart.   Overall the dish was executed well, although if I went again I would try out their other desserts before jumping back again to the crepe cake.  I hope to find it at another place so I can compare it, but I feel like this is a great jumping off point. 

One thing I will say as a side note, is that table that had never been bused was still dirty when I left in addition to 2 other tables.   It would be nice if they paid more attention to their dining area because it really was not very busy."}
{"text":"Love the place and especially the owner. To be honest I don't go all the time but he remembers me. Good desserts and drinks. Gets busy sometimes."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe with yummy desserts. One day I was just craving honey toast and found this place. Not only are their honey toast awesome, they have crepe cakes and their desserts equally delicious. They also have a variety of teas, frappes and lattes as well. It's a small cafe but has a decent amount of seating and every time I've gone it's busy, but usually I can find a seat. It's a great place to grab and nice dessert and coffee/tea if that's what you're craving."}
{"text":"It was my first time here today. I tried the Green Tea Layer Cake.  It was sooooo good and delicious!!! Just Fabulous"}
{"text":"Great little place. They have pastries, and hot drinks. Nice atmosphere, great for dates."}
{"text":"It could have been 5 stars because there were not much selections of sweets. I really like the macha green tea crepe because it was different and yummy. I have not tasted anything like it before. This is another a must go to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Let's face it: Las Vegas is about 1-2 years behind food trends. When I first moved here 3 years ago I would regularly search for honey/brick toast options in the valley and would always end up exasperated and resigned to the fact that I'd have to satisfy that craving when I visited California.

Now 3 years later and honey toast is all over the place! TBH I came here two years ago to see if they had honey toast and they did not at the time which was a bummer but not anymore!

Anyway, for a Wednesday night this place had a steady stream of customers at 10:30 PM. I came along because I needed to kill time waiting for my husband. While I'm confident in doing things independently, you won't be self-conscious and alone because there are tons of people studying.. going on dates.. celebrating with their families. 

Service is good. They answered my questions and were patient when I couldn't decide what to order and if I wanted it for here or to go. Finally I settled on honey toast with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and vanilla ice cream along with a mango iced tea. Both were so good. SO GOOD. The mango tea was a little sweet and heavy on the syrup but that was fine. The ice dilutes it. The honey toast is definitely shareable. It took about 10 minutes to make so be patient. Also recommend eating it as soon as you can (and not taking it to go). 

I can't wait to come back for more dessert loaded bread.. because who doesn't love carbs on carbs on carbs?!"}
{"text":"This place is a good hang out spot. I went around 9-10pm and it was pretty busy and packed. My favorite thing to get here is the honey toast (which they're popular for). The toast itself is $5 and toppings vary prices from .50-$1 each. So it can add up. Mine came out to be $11 with tip. I had to take one star off because I wasn't a fan of their Nutella milkshake/smoothie. It was really strong but for you Nutella lovers, you'd probably like it! They also didn't have strawberry ice cream that I wanted to add with the toast. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place has potrntial, although i would have liked my order a little stronger...the service was great and the place is welcoming..good to hangout here..."}
{"text":"I went when the store opened and I went back with my friends another time. It's a cute store, the crepe cake is alright, I wouldn't say it's that worth it. But for the aesthetics it's nice."}
{"text":"This is a whole in the wall type of place. They are known for their green tea crepe cake, but as far as their drinks go, I was not as impressed. Their taro milk tea tastes too powdery for me."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! You have to HAVE TO get the honey toast with strawberries. The location isn't the best but you just have to try this place."}
{"text":"We just love \"Is Sweet \"!!! We visit every time we come to Vegas. The honey toast is absolutely the best dessert EVER!!! The people here do a perfect job of making your dessert extra special..the attention to detail is awesome. The owner is a very nice woman who takes great pride in her shop and it shows. We will be back many more times!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the matcha crepe cake and tiramisu. The tiramisu was delicious. The crepe cake was just okay."}
{"text":"Oh man, I can't say enough great things about this place. Their honey toast is phenomenal. I've been telling anyone who will listen they need to try it.

So I went with a couple friends after having dinner down the street. I was so glad I finally tried it. I had their honey toast with strawberry glaze, fresh strawberries, and blueberries. I was bummed because they had run out of mango, but the blueberries were a good second choice. The toast had a great consistency and the flavour was ridiculously tasty.

My friend ordered the sizzling brownie. I tried some of his and it was also quite delicious. Would I forsake my sweet, sweet honey toast for it? Absolutely not. But if brownies are your jam, I definitely recommend giving it ago. (But seriously, just get the honey toast.)"}
{"text":"Is sweet is sweet! 
So we ordered the crepe cakes in the flavors of green tea and red velvet.  We also ordered the honey toast with strawberries, condensed milk, and ice cream.  The crepes were alright. For me, I am a sweet tooth so I expected the crepe cakes to be sweet but it wasnt sweet enough.  I felt it lacked some type of sweetness.  The hone toast was great!! I recommend it.  The toppings are ala carte so you could customize it to your liking.  I enjoyed my toppings.  It comes nice and toasted and drenched in butter and honey.  So good!!!! For the three desserts it came out to $24.  Im shocked that they dont have boba but they do have teas i believe and slushies and what not."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to hang out. Their desserts are really good. The Ice chocolate milk tea is amazing!! Definitely a favorite of mine. Highly recommended if you have a sweet tooth! :)"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmy perfect menu, gets very busy but they accommodate and work quickly. Everything was delicious and the restaurant is very cute inside! Love the quirky and fun designs! We enjoyed the coconut cake, matcha crepe cake, sizzling brownie + honey toast"}
{"text":"Super cute place!! We got a Vanille crepe cake (6.50) honey toast (5.50) and Nutella iced latte (5.75)everything 2as amazing and not to sweet like they sound. Only downside here you pay for every topping you want. These toppings can range from fruits, drizzle, nuts, and ice cream. Both of the dishes ended up around $9.00 each after all the toppings. Still worth it and definitely a must try."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, we came here to try their crepe cakes. We should've be meen out partying but we drove here to eat dessert instead. When I got there, I realized they also had a lot of unique specialty lattes that I would've loved to try as well. Since I came here for the matcha crepe cake though, I thought I'd stick to getting that. The place was empty when we got here on a weekday night so the service was fast and they brought the dessert to our table.

This is the first time I had crepe cake come with matcha sauce, which I thought was pretty cool. The matcha seemed to be thicker in this cake and the crepe layers weren't as fine as Lady M. Nonetheless, it was really delicious and I would definitely recommend this cake. I'm just a sucker for crepe cake and I thought the matcha sauce was a nice touch. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd like to try more of their desserts and coffee options."}
{"text":"This is a small cafe located in china town. They specialize in drinks and desserts! I've been here a few times and have tried their honey toast and green tea crepe cake. 

You can customize your honey toast with your favorite toppings and ice cream. Absolutely delicious! The green tea crepe cake had a nice texture but overall it was just okay. Their drinks are good just wish they offered boba as well. 

It is a small shop with limited seating. They have cute decorations and if you're into studying at cafes this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"After all the times I've been here, I still haven't written a review. This place is probably the best dessert cafe in Vegas that's cute, decently priced, and extremely delicious. When my boyfriend and I first found this cafe, I kid you not, we came here every single day for a whole week. We've tried all of the teas and most desserts. Gam, the barista, knows our names. He is super kind and friendly, as well as the other employees! Though we don't come everyday, you can still catch is here at least once a week. 

Location and decoration: This cafe is quite hidden and is easily missed, but the great part is there's plenty of parking. It's in the very corner of the Plaza, and the entrance is next to the covered parking spots. The inside of the cafe is adorable. Vintage, mismatched furniture and dreamy music gives off that indie, coffee shop vibe where you come to read a book on a rainy day. I just love it in here. Plus, they have free WiFi so you can do homework.

My personal favorite drink is either the black sesame milk tea or the Thai lemon tea. Must try!! For desserts, I would recommend the matcha mille crepe, creme br√ªl√©e, or create your own waffle. The desserts aren't overly sweet, just the perfect amount of sweetness!

Today we got hot matcha milk tea, passion fruit iced tea, waffles with strawberry ice and brownie bites, and a strawberry parfait. Delicious as always!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute dessert shop! The honey toast is the BEST. My husband and I can't get enough! Even though it takes awhile to toast, the freshness and warmth makes it worth it! The presentation is ALWAYS on point, I love that they take their time on it also. It can get pricey as you add on toppings, flavors, and ice cream. I love getting condensed milk, strawberry toppings, and strawberry ice cream. We recently tried it with green tea ice cream and it was just as delicious!"}
{"text":"A cute spot to hang out and enjoy desserts & drinks. The green tea crepe cake is delicious and a must try!"}
{"text":"The Honey Toast is literally an orgasm of the mouth. It's pretty incredible and considering they are open late make this place even more desirable! Craving that mouth watering toast with melted Nutella and Ice cream, well look no further! Is Sweet is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Very cute coffee shop!

Came here at night to grab some coffee. They shop is located in the back of a small plaza, a little hard to find. The inside has cute decorations and looks like a pretty good spot to get some work done. There were also a lot of families here, so I'm assuming the dessert here is pretty good. My friend got the mango iced tea and I got an iced coffee. My coffee was delicious, just as I expected, but my friends iced tea was even better. It tasted as if there were some pur√©e in it."}
{"text":"Is Sweet is aight.

Hidden in the back corner of some small business square away from the busy streets of Las Vegas Chinatown, this is an average cute coffee shop to visit.

For the price of $4/5 I thought that our drinks would go as expected, but:
-The Coffee Frappe turned out overwhelmingly bitter. The guy willingly changed it to dark chocolate per our request. 
-Dark Chocolate was good and definitely preferable over White Chocolate, which was my sister's pick. 
-While I instantly almost fell in love with the Mango Iced Tea, I was thrown off by learning and seeing that they're already pre made in a pitcher. The generic sweetness led me to believe that my drink was made out of powder. Hence the absence of real mango bits and/or authenticity. 

Our customized Honey Toast topped with Nutella, whipped cream and chocolate powder was the safest pick and tasted just right. A bit stylish. The Nutella flavor was abundant in your mouth. It didn't take long for us to finish it.

Although there was effort to make the cafe cute and snazzy, the ambience just felt a bit underwhelming for me. Could it be the underground electronic music? The disorganized seating arrangement? Or was it the sight of the cashier resting her pouted lips on top of the window guard next to her?"}
{"text":"It's Sweet'O Clock! Time for some SWEETS for the year 2017. 

They have great selection of desserts (layered crepes, waffles, toast) and drinks. 
~ I like how the crepe is not too sweet but those who like it sweeter can order additional ice cream at the side. 
~ I like how the toast was served with the fruits neatly arrange on the side. 

Cute and homely interior that makes you feel like home. The red brick makes a great photo-ops background. 001/100"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is two whole sides are open windowed areas, really lit up and has nice decor. Kinda like your walking into a friends home. If you have the boba for \"here\" they put it in a nice glass cup. Another chill place will be back."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to find new dessert places to go to around Chinatown, and I'm glad I came here. The place is a bit hidden in this small plaza so I'm really hoping the reviews will get people to come and try it, because it's definitely worth it when you have a sweet tooth (well, at least one that doesn't require extra doses of sugar). 

I tried the blueberry cake and the iced matcha milk tea after having dinner with friends and both were very good. The matcha milk tea was a nice compliment to the cake because it's not overly sweet. Same could be said for the cake too. So yes you can have dinner and still have dessert, if you come here, because it doesn't make you feel guilty, like you just ate a tub of sugar."}
{"text":"I always love coming here! My favorite are their crepe cakes. Now, they have 2 flavors, green tea (the best one)& the red velvet. It has just the right touch of sweetness and I love that it's so thin and a bit airy. I enjoy it a lot, and to be honest .. I can probably finish 2 at a time (fat ass for life haha) 
I have tried their milk tea from here too, and they were pretty good. Staff are always nice and if you don't feel like buying a milk tea, to flush down the dessert, they have complimentary water"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because when I put the address in maps and routed, it took me to a place down the street. We made so many u-turns and was about to give up... Lol 

Maybe it was just me but their cake menu wasn't up and I didn't really know what to order. I ended up getting the matcha green tea cake with chocolate ice cream! It was great! I was afraid that it was going to be way too sweet (hence the name) but it was surprisingly balanced. Their earl grey tea was good too. 

The guy was nice but, like I said, I wasn't really sure about what to order since I didn't see anything but the drinks. If I didn't ask him what the other customers ordered, idk what I would've ended up with lol"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and a great place to meet with a group of friends. Clean and beautiful. Free Wi-Fi and free parking. Parking is tight, but free. And the menu, everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Cool spot with neat decor. It's definitely a nice place to hang out with friends or do some work since they offer free WiFi. I didn't try any of their beverages, but I indulged in two of their well-known treats.

Red Velvet Crepe Cake ($6.50): Definitely pretty with the contrasting red and white layers and as a crepe cake, decent, however, there was zero flavor suggesting \"Red Velvet.\" Obviously, the draw of this is the fact that it is red velvet and it's unfortunately a sham. It's randomly served with a strawberry preserve. Hard pass.

Honey Toast with Strawberries, Condensed Milk, Vanilla Ice Cream ($7.00): You can order Honey Toast as is ($4), but I don't think it would be very tasty by itself. It definitely needs toppings. I was concerned at first since the toast isn't sliced into pieces and not what I'm used to, but the elements were all there. Lightly toasted fluffy, chewy bread; drizzled honey, and I really enjoyed the combination of my toppings. There are a lot of toppings to choose. Condensed Milk is highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a cute little cafe. We grabbed lunch next door at Viet Noodle Bar and decided to walk down the shopping complex to this cafe. Loved the atmosphere from the moment we walked in. Mismatched chairs, cute table and great lighting. 

I was already full from lunch but decided a honeydew iced tea would quench my thirst! The kind server brought out the drink almost immediately and boy was it delicious! Next time when I have my space in my tummy I'm going to try the honeydew frapp√©! My fianc√© and I decided to sit outside at one of the tables and soak in the sun. Good times."}
{"text":"I would recommend their Crepe Cakes for sure. Its light and melts in your mouth kind of dessert #yummeh. I prefer the Matcha Crepe Cake over Vanilla...but they're both good. I think thats what is gonna make me come back again and again.
The decor is simple and cute. However, I kind of don't like the location tho...its soo random. But overall experience was awesome."}
{"text":"Plenty parking. Cheerful cafe playing a variety of relaxing music European inspired.  
Matcha crepe cake- light, not too sweet. Easily shared between 2 people. Beautiful presentation. 
Peppermint tea- ordered a pot of it to share."}
{"text":"Great place to go and study. Very cute layout and the greatest drinks and desserts  first time here and I loved it"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. 

I was visiting for work, and wanted dessert, so I checked Yelp and stumbled upon IS SWEET. It took me half an hour to find the place (thanks, Google Maps), and by the time I got there, I was super frustrated after circling the same 2 blocks 27 times, but it was worth the trouble. 

Cute, quiet tea/coffee shop. Adorable desserts in the display case. It was late, and quiet in there with only one other table occupied. I ordered a cup of tea and a honey toast with sweetened condensed milk, strawberry, banana and vanilla ice cream (as per the recommendation of the gentleman who took my order). I sat down with my book and my tea, and 15 minutes later, my impressive dessert arrived. Holy presentation! And the thing was massive! I've never had anything like it before. Crispy, buttery, sweet, and utterly delicious. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. 

The service was excellent. The dessert was excellent. I wish I could get something similar in Denver, because it was SOOOOOOOO good!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple...

Vanilla Crepe Cake and coffee were ok, and it's a nice little coffee house.  That's where it starts and stops.

Over-priced for food where no baking is done on premises.

If I'm spending $13 on a piece of cake and coffee, it better be high quality and made fresh daily there(neither of which are the case), not shipped in from another bakery.

There's a string of these Asian Coffee/Tea dessert places that are grossly overpriced.  

Crown Bakery, Sweets Raku, Baguette Cafe, Rosallie: just a few places where they actually make their food on premises and charge accordingly.  In fact, less expensive in some cases plus higher quality. 

I don't mind spending $13 for coffee and cake if it's worth it."}
{"text":"Cute place !! Hard to find at first, don't listen to your map for directions ! It's in the same complex where Viet Noodle Bar is located !

The lady at the counter gave us some suggestions since it was our first time here. 

The wife and I went with the matcha crepe cake and the honey toast with vanilla ice cream, nutella, and bananas with a cup of black coffee. 

The matcha crepe cake is amazing. Not too sweet but perfect and it comes with green tea sauce, strawberry and a slice of grapefruit.

Honey toast came out nice and sweet. Order ice cream with it! You won't regret it 

Black coffee helped with all the sweetness and it was nice and strong. It balanced everything."}
{"text":"I like the weather inside and staff are very nice. Coffee & greentea cake is my favourite. Love this place"}
{"text":"Our go to for honey toast in Vegas!! Always warm and fresh and the employees here are always patient with my indecisiveness! Their tropical teas and hot teas are always good, milk teas are decent but not like anything that out of this world. The green tea crepe cake was sort of bland, but crepes are bland so I was expecting that. But the honey toast will always be my fav item on the menu."}
{"text":"Is Sweet is a hidden gem! The cafe is nice and bright, relaxing  atmosphere, frindly service. They serve fresh locally roasted coffee which is hard to find, varities of dessert are also fresh and homemade...yummy! Free Wi-Fi, great place to meet and hang out...love this place!"}
{"text":"Price is very reasonable for the amount you are getting. We got the honey toast with strawberry and mango with 2 ice cream, a matcha crepe cake and 2 16oz milk tea. It only came out to be 25 which its pretty cheap. Their honey toast is kind of small, it's only half of the regular box toast. And when it came out (pretty fast) it wasn't that hot so I'm assuming they pre-toasted it? Not sure, could be wrong! But it was decorated very nicely and cute. A lot of mango for 1 buck. Thai tea was very good, didn't really like the taro milktea, it tasted very artificial for my like. The crepe cake was good. Overall it was a good experience"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and this time my friends and I decided to get the matcha crepe cake which cake with ice cream and some matcha sauce to drizzle over the crepe. It was really soft but it did not really taste like matcha. I really wish there was more matcha in the cake! We also got brick toast with vanilla ice cream and it was delicious. Wish toppings weren't so pricey though."}
{"text":"So freaking good!!!! Oh my God the honey toast is amazing and the service is very nice. Amazing amazing amazing!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot for desert love it wanna go back soon just far from me but worth the drive. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite dessert caf√© places here in Las Vegas. 

I always order the matcha crepe which contains several layers of crepe, green tea flavoring sauce, whip cream and some sort of fruit on the side. The green tea sauce is on the side and you pour however much you want on the crepe cake. Every bite is heaven and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.

Sometimes I order their honey toast. These are so delicious. I usually order with strawberries, banana, strawberry ice cream and condense milk. The honey toast is unbelievably amazing with all the fruits and ice cream together.

I tried their matcha green tea drink. I really like green tea and they did a good job making this one.

Their caf√© is cute inside. There are unique tables and chairs to sit and relax. They also have wifi."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place because of their cute desserts. However, when I went on a Wednesday afternoon, they didn't have the \"Nutella Mousse\" or \"Hello Kitty Strawberry Cake,\" which is all I went there for. Apparently, they only have it on some days.

I would've left, but I was here with a friend catching up. I had no idea what to order after that because nothing else on their menu stood out. I ended up getting a basic honey toast.

If you're going here to try something in particular, I suggest calling beforehand to make sure it's there."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. I've had it booked marked for a couple months and just had dinner in Chinatown so I decided to stop by and try their green tea Mille crepe and see what the hype was all about. The crepe itself was just okay. Nothing I would go back for again. It was just too sweet and lacked the green tea flavor I was looking for. It was also on the mushy side because of the cream fillings in between each crepe layer. It also came with a sauce to pour over but that just overpowered the cake too much in my opinion. The drinks were good though! I tried the taro milk tea and it delicious! It didn't taste powdery or artificial at all. The red velvet frappuccino was also really good. It tasted more like coffee than a chocolate cocoa though so if you like coffee drinks you'll like that."}
{"text":"Friends were in town, and what better way to celebrate friendship than share a few desserts and a cup of coffee?

I ordered a caramel macchiato, toast with strawberries and bananas and the green tea mille crepe. 

My caramel macchiato was a bit too sweet. The toast was good, I think superior to what I've tried in town. I nor my friends were not quite fond of the green tea mille crepe, but still a must try."}
{"text":"I love their Macha crepe cake!! It's not too sweet and you can really taste the Macha flavor. The place is a little small and the decoration is a little unique. I like the ambience.. definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Is Sweet is a sweet place to get some desert and taro slush. The space can be a little small in terms of accommodating people, but there are also seats outside.

When it isn't too busy, it's a nice place to study or do work on your laptop. I recommend their matcha crepe cake! It has a nice presentation as well, for the gram!"}
{"text":"Alas, I have made it to IS SWEET! I originally came here for a crepe cake and was able to try the green tea crepe cake. I've seen previous reviews about them running out, but I came by around 10pm on July 4th and they still had some. Not sure if they've started making more since they opened.

I couldn't help but return the next day for a honey toast after seeing the pictures on Yelp! Both items were delicious, and came out pretty quickly (the sign on the door says it will take at least 15 minutes for the honey toast, ours came out faster).

I'd definitely return for both items and am on a mission to try their drinks next!"}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp when I was on the look out for sweets Off the strip. Boom, this place pops up first. So I snag directions and off we go. 

Arrived right at 1130pm

Walked in and asked the very nice girl at the front for all the good stuff. She smiles and says All the sweets is great. I bust out the yelp app and show her the stuff that caught my eye. 

Crepe Matcha Cake. Wowzers so light and fluffy. Loved it especially that drizzle !

Chocolate Mouse Bear looking thing was devoured in seconds,  especially by the kids. 

Honey Toast with ice Cream and brownie bits. This was decadent,  just absolutely delicious. I was saddened when we finished it. I wish we had arrived sooner to be able to order 2 of these bad boys. 

Finally the pistachio soy latte. Just amazing and my kind of latte. More places needs to make this wonderful treat of caffeine rush. 

Cozy vibe. With only one other small group in the place. We sat outside since it was perfect weather. 

Loved this place! We'll be back 100%

Enjoy and Stay Wild!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this place so decided to check it out. We got the passion fruit green tea and the matcha green tea crepe cake. The drink was really good and it was in a mason jar which automatically makes it a little cooler. The sizes of the drink could be a little bigger for the size but they were good. As for the crepe cake I had a little mixed feelings ordering the matcha green tea one since the matcha flavor tends to be a little stronger and bitter to me and not exactly what I wanted in the cake. After getting the cake it looked really good and they give you the sauce to pour over yourself. The cake was nice and soft and was surprisingly not sweet at all and the flavors were very mild and not over powering. Will definitely be back to try some of the other flavors that they have."}
{"text":"A cute, little hole in the wall. I come here once in a blue moon for honey toast. I've also tried the popular green tea cake. Overall, the place is nicely decorated, comfy, and really good desserts if you're having a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my best friend the other day. We both got the red velvet crepe but upon receiving it, it more looked like a bright pink or something and not a red color. The sauce that came with it was a bit too sweet for me but the whipped cream that was on top was delicious! Heard the matcha crepe was good but I figured why not try the red velvet. Maybe next time I'll try the matcha crepe. The inside was cute. They also sell cheesecake from the case on the side."}
{"text":"I've never had a hot pistachio before, but it was delicious and I crave more! The honey toast is just as amazing and paired with ice cream is just the cherry on top! I want to go back and try more items :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to study at since it is open late. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, especially at night, but if you come here in the afternoon, it's nice and quiet. The desserts are so cute! I have never tried any of their honey toasts, however, I love all of the crepe cakes! I don't know how long ago they started serving this, but I really like the ham and cheese toast. I know this is a dessert place, but I'm glad that there is finally a non-dessert option here. I wish there were more, haha!"}
{"text":"The best dessert in town. The decor is colorful and very cute. Toasted and green tea crepe cake were amazing and must try coconut cake."}
{"text":"First time here with the boyfriend and I had the matcha green tea crepe cake since the photos on Yelp made it look AMAZING. It was delicious and a light cake. I also had a nonfat matcha green tea latte. I love matcha green tea anything lol. My guy had the chocolate cake dessert which was sweet and rich, very yummy. Will be back. Kind of hard to find since it's located in the back of a strip plaza shared with a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Originally came here for the snow ice that was displayed on Yelp pictures. However, when we asked for it, the lady working said that they don't have that item. I showed her the picture on Yelp, and she said, \"That's only during the summer.\" We decided to get the lava toast with sliced almonds on top, but they ran out of that too. The lady working had the worst customer service. We asked, \"Are there any other nuts available?\" She replied, \"No.\" Then just stared at us. Her face looked so upset as if she did not want to be there.

Now about the lava toast, it was definitely very delicious. The inside was warm and the toast was soft. The ice cream was a nice touch of cold to the dessert. You can pour the condensed milk on top of the dessert yourself, which adds a fun interactive part to the dessert! This was probably the best part of the experience.

I also ordered the matcha crepe cake, it was a little bland and did not meet my expectations. They also have a matcha sauce that can be poured over the cake, which was pretty tasty, but was just an extra sauce of matcha. Could've been more tasty if it was chocolate? But that is just me.

The kitchen was VERY dirty. I sat at the back table and could see everything. They do use gloves, but the also touch EVERYTHING with those gloves. The floor had dirty towels in the middle where anyone could slip and trip over. They didn't clean up after each dessert was made. I asked for a small container and the lady handed me one after scooping Nutella. So my container had Nutella all over it. 

My experience here, could've been a little better, but the lava toast is what saved the amount of stars on my review."}
{"text":"This is a very cute and small cafe that is perfect for catching up with friends, especially if you're in the mood for something sweet. There are a lot of options for drinks, all of which are tasty and reasonably priced; however, the shining star of this cafe has to be their array of desserts. One of the most popular is their crepe cakes which are beautifully presented on a slab with a complimentary sauce, fruit, and sometimes ice cream, and they taste as good as they look."}
{"text":"WHY HAVE I NOT REVIEWED THIS?

It's retarded how much I've been here. It's always my go to spot after dinner or just to take someone for some coffee and desserts. I've been on a few dates here too, and brought family just to enjoy. Hell, last night I bumped into a friend there who mentioned that she only went to IS SWEET because I recommended it and always take great Snapchats. lmao. 

I just need to remember to always check in on yelp. I tend to forget because I go straight to the dessert and stare insanely at them. 

I've tried most, if not, all of their desserts. The tiramisu, the Hello Kitty strawberry cake, cr√®me brule, bannofie pie, cheesecake, cute little bear face nutella mouse, the chocolate cake, and of course, their crepe cakes. I've also tried their waffle and their honey toast. 

Drink wise, I've had their caramel frappe, taro milk tea, mocha latte, and a couple others. 

I have not been disappointed! 
It's a very comfortable ambience. Rustic, yet trendy. The music is always mellow or some sort of acoustic covers of top charted songs. It has plenty of seats, but it does get busy. A lot of people like the place and the brick wall look is where people always try to sit at. Great background for your picture taking needs! The lighting is somewhat dimmed, but still a lot of lighting at night. During the day, the sunlight hugs the place nicely.  

The presentation of the desserts and drinks are adorable to where you HAVE to take a pictures! So bring your camera's or have juice on your phone to take a ton of pics. Its funny, even though I've taken a bunch of pics of the desserts I've had, if I get the same dessert again, I still take pics! lol.

Anyway, when Game (co-owner) is working and see's me, he already knows what I want. \"HEY!! Tiramisu?\" HAHAHAH! Love him! Every time I see someone walk in, I see him always smiling and welcoming anyone and everyone. Princess too! There's always great attitude in there!

{"text":"Desserts here are a MUST try. Though things can get a bit pricey, you'll find that they really take their time on your choice of desserts to make them both taste delicious AND look beautiful. With that said, it does take a bit of time to get your order. In the times I've been here, they were pretty late at night, so finding seats haven't been a problem for me, and same with parking. My friends and I have gotten the sizzling brownie (BEST brownie I have ever had), a few of the customized honey toasts, and this chocolate volcano drink. All were delicious, filling, and made us feel guilty after. But what kind of good dessert won't make you feel that way after consumption?

Also, the decor here is cute! The vibe is relaxing, the decor on the walls and tables are colorful but subtle. I ended up staying for a couple of hours and just talked with friends in the times I've gone here. The staff were welcoming and helpful.

Will definitely come back here whenever I'm back home in the city. 100% recommend this."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Vegas for desserts. I love the green tea honey toast. This place is small and is always pretty busy."}
{"text":"It's Delicious!!!
Me & my favorite foodie stopped into It's Sweet after super casual dinner to satisfy our sweet tooth! 
The aroma was amazing from the moment we walked in and I couldn't wait to order!

I ordered Tiramisu for $6 and I was portioned nicely and taste pretty good

Of course I'm not done....

I also ordered the Honey Toast W/Vanilla Ice Cream Omg!!! The honey, toast and ice cream was the right amount of sweet and salty goodness!!! Must order!!!

The vanilla crepe cake was pretty bland after my first two dessert choices to honest I wasn't impressed.

The Mango Tea is delish

I'll be back for sure!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was me & my friend's first time here today. We found this place by people's tags on Instagram and the pictures of the food looked so cute and good that we had to try it ourselves. After being inside for almost 20min still looking at the menu/pictures of their food online until we finally ordered. 2 ladies (regulars) recommended the honey toast. They told us they're almost at the store everyday lol. The place is ADORABLE! And view of the mountains was ok. I didn't understand why there was chairs outside until the sun was setting! It was beautiful!!! (Go and grab a drink/bite before sunset!) Once we got our food me and my friend spent a good amount taking pics that our ice cream was melting. The honeytoast (A MUST TO ORDER, you can build your own) was thebombdotcom and the drinks was served so cute! I loved everything."}
{"text":"Very friendly and generous staff. They have the best mango sweet tea. Ambiance in this place is also amazing. It is cozy and chill. They also play good music. Good place to relax, study and/or just simply enjoy their delicious deserts!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and comfy. I ordered the Nutella Frappe, and the Matcha Crepes. The only reason that I'm not giving five stars is because when I ordered for my boyfriend and I, the Nutella Frappe had tasted different than he remembered and when I asked the cashier about it he said that we had ordered it with coffee. Neither of us ever said coffee, but there are no big complaints."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some dessert! The ice cream is outstanding. The wife enjoyed her hot chocolate and she ranked in top 5, which for her is alot since she is very picky. We have shared two desserts, one was the ice cream which was very tasty, and the second was the crepes cake, which I found bland. It needed something extra to make it stand out, however it was very fluffy and the side of strawberry jelly made it eatable."}
{"text":"Nice dessert restaurant!!! Honey toast are yummy with the vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries. The cake are homemade and serve with cute decorations. They beverage are nice but a bit too sweet, I will need to tell them to lower on the sweetness. The best part is they open late."}
{"text":"Really delicious desserts! I love the coziness of the place. It's a great place to just hang out and chill or sometimes I see people there studying. We had trouble finding the place the first time, the gps led us to some apartments lol anyway, try the green tea crepe cake! It's super yummy and I prefer it over the red velvet crepe cake. I really enjoyed their honey toast as well. For the drinks, we usually get a pot of tea to share. I love their music playlist here. Had to Shazam a bunch of the songs coz they were so good lol The service was nice, friendly, and fast."}
{"text":"YUM! My friend and I were craving honey toast and we found this place. Hands down best honey toast I've had! Made perfectly toasted, not burnt at all! Have to say it's a little pricey but for the amount you get, its definitely worth it. Perfect size to share. Also got a matcha frappe and it was bomb! Perfectly creamy and not too sweet, made with just the right amount of matcha. Will for sure be coming back if I'm craving either! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice small hide away. Honey toast is a bomb. A lot to select. Love the fresh bakery. We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Fantastic was able to use the 10 percent off discount by checking in. Really love the ambience and how swift their staff was. I had the Carmel Macchiato and it was better than Starbucks in my opinion. Was made perfect not too sweet and coffee was freshly brewed. Plus I tried my friends green tea crepe same thing just right and fresh. Totally coming back with my BF and friends again."}
{"text":"I'm a little undecided about this place... Wether I like or wether I love it haha. This is my first time here and my friends and I got a variety of stuff. You can mix the tea flavors here. My friend got mango lychee, another one mango, and I got the strawberry lychee which was recommended by the server. I got it with less ice and half the sugar. Remember to check into yelp to get 10% off!!  

The tea flavor is very strong Which I really enjoyed. Although it was half sugar, I felt that my tea was still a bit in the sweet side. I enjoyed it nonetheless. I also liked my friends's mango and mango lychee drinks. 

We also ordered the green matcha layered cake. We got it to go so we didn't get the pretty plating like all the pics on yelp. I tried the cake first without the matcha sauce and it had no matcha flavor whatsoever. It just tasted like regular Creme cake.   However, with the sauce it was fantastic!  The sauce had all the matcha flavor with great texture and taste. 

So I like this place but haven't made up my mind if I love it or not. Some hits and some misses. I'll make up my mind when I come again next time :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite dessert shop! I live for the honey toast! They also have delicious tiramisu and their crepe cake is good (I've only had the green tea one) but it's kind of a weird texture and not as sweet as you'd expect from a cake. I've also had the nutella bear which is very adorable and picture worthy but not so easy to eat and I remember it tasting not so special. 

I definitely recommend coming here with friends or on a date and sharing the honey toast! Make sure you get it with ice cream! 

I still want to try more of the drinks but I have had the Thai tea which was pretty good"}
{"text":"I tried the honey toast with strawberries, mango, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream last night and it was amazing! Perfect level of sweetness and the bread was perfectly toasted on the outside while soft and delicious on the inside. I will definitely be back to try the matcha crepe cake!"}
{"text":"Their crepe cakes are by far the best I've tasted. I orderrd the Matcha Crepe Cake and the Matcha was not to miss yet not overpowering. Hubby ordered their mango snow ice topped with mango ice cream and toasted almonds and it was delish! Many youngsters hanging out but we didn't mind just to try their desserts. Great dessert place for sure!"}
{"text":"what do you know about the balance of life? Carbs, fruits, chocolate, Nutella, ice cream... all in one, built to texturizing perfection! Life is about a healthy balance. 

I say the honey toast with bananas, strawberries, Nutella, and Vanilla ice cream brings health and harmony to a complete full circle. 

How do you want to satisfy your soul any given day at any given hour....you come here and get yourself some honey toast. Guaranteed to be the cure all remedy. Happy belly, happy heart is what I always say.

And the ambiance here is killer! The coffee shop tunes playing and the wifi availability makes it a great place to sit down and hang out and enjoy some good desserts. 

Really hidden spot though. It sits In the last section of the plaza, you will miss it because there are no signs facing the street. Pull up a map and direct yourself accordingly. Worth the find!"}
{"text":"it's kind of hidden and towards the end of Chinatown but sooooo worth coming! I love their matcha green tea crepe cake  made to order but doesn't take long at all! their fruits that come with it are always so fresh too! try it!"}
{"text":"Oh, IS SWEET. You always do me right, and I love coming here. 

Ambiance: 4 - Super cute place. When people leave all the tables, you could probably study here. It doesn't seat many, though. There's probably 9 or 10 tables. 

Service: 4 - Super nice and super sweet. 

Food: 4 - Let's be honest, people come here for the crepe cake and the honey toast. Maybe the coffee. 

//crepe cake: People can say what they want about this crepe cake, I actually like the fact that the cake itself is not that sweet. That it is the sauce that gives the flavor. I mean, any more 'flavor' and I'd be having me some diabetes. My favorite is the green tea. Also, even though the ice cream is an extra charge, my expert opinion is for you to get it. It just makes it better. 

Drinks are not really the forte of IS SWEET. I don't like the boba or the coffee. But I did order the mango smoothie and loved it! It had the 3 things that a proper smoothie -should- have: It was fresh, it was made of real mango (not artificial, thank godd!!), and it gave me a brain freeze. Seriously, though, it was really good. 

My last piece of advice is..don't miss the turn for IS SWEET. It's kind of hidden. If you're coming from Decatur side, it is a right turn after the ol' wedding cake design place!"}
{"text":"Good dessert place ! clean and comfy. 
They are not many display cake. quality of cake 7.5/10 Nice staff."}
{"text":"Great dessert place to hang out and chat with your friends. Free refill on hot water for a pot of tea. Honey toast was pretty good and was on the cheaper side when compared to the fancy desserts in Chinatown. It's not Taiwan level, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better honey toast spot in Vegas. Ambiance is great for chatting or hanging out and there's a fairly large younger crowd. 

Overall one of the more unique dessert places in Las Vegas. Would come again."}
{"text":"Looking for a super cute dessert place to hang out with a group of friends? This is your spot. There is something for everyone here. Desserts like honey toast, crepe cakes, cakes, coffees, lattes, teas, and milk teas. We rolled in 6 people deep and found some good seating in the corner by the brick wall. Furniture is cute and eclectic.

We ordered 6 different desserts: 
- matcha green tea crepe cake with green tea ice cream. 
- red velvet crepe cake 
- chocolate cake
- honey toast (2) with various toppings
- green tea waffle

Get your cameras ready folks, you'll be fighting over the best aerial shot. Picture taking takes like 5+ minutes getting the best angle. Can we eat already? \"I need for my instagram...facebook...snapchat...\" Myself and another elite, \"I need it for Yelp!\"

Goodness gracious, the hype is real. The matcha green tea crepe cake is pretty darn good. I really like the red velvet crepe cake as well. The chocolate cake was very rich and decadent, but a bit much. The waffle was just okay. I prefer Serenade's honey toast. 

After all that sugar, what better to wash it all down with another sugary drink? Not. My mistake was getting the iced caramel macchiato. I would have much rather been content with the complimentary self serve water. A common complaint at my table was why no mason jars? Our drinks didn't have the cool factor. 

Well, I think the duo running the show were just slammed. They are super sweet and friendly!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little dessert/coffee place in Chinatown. I love the fact that their furniture isn't matchy matchy and that it's clean!

Ordered the matcha crepe cake and the chocolate mousse for my daughter. Their presentation is super cute and I love the wooden little trays they use to serve the dessert. The crepe cake could use a bit more sweetness. The chocolate that covered the mousse was really hard & it took a while until my daughter finally got into the mousse & cake part of it. She was literally stabbing it and still won't break lol. My brother ordered the honey toast & it was deliciousssss!! I wish I ordered it. Def ordering it next time, but won't be ordering the crepe cake & the chocolate bear mousse anymore lol. It was ok as my first time. The highlight was the honey toast for sure :) 

Oh, def a plus for their fruit infused water that they offer for FREE. I hate when dessert places sell expensive ass water bottles that you can get for a dollar at a gas station. They get you too because they know people will get thirsty after eating sweets. Anyway, fin."}
{"text":"This review does not have anything to do with their food but rather with the way my family and I were treated. Family wanted Boba after having lunch at Aloha Kitchen so we went to Tea Time in china town. Kids wanted honey toast and my daughter suggested IS SWEET - we all piled into the car and headed over. Once there, we noticed the sign that said no outside food or drink. I proceeded to order 3 honey toasts topped with ice cream. There were 6 of us and a small table outside with 2 chairs.  I went up to the counter, asked permission to bring our drinks in so we can eat our food at the table that sat 6. The guy said sure no problem. Now mind you, they DO NOT serve boba. After a few minutes the Asian guy came out and told us we had to leave our drinks out side or eat our food outside. Now, had there been seating for all of us, that would not have been a problem. I think what got me upset was the way he spoke to us, he was condescending - not rude but almost insulting. I told him to cancel my order and got my money back? As we left he said loudly \"have a wonderful day\" to which I responded, I will because I have my money back and you just lost 6 customers."}
{"text":"Didn't have any expectations when we went in other than my hubby was craving something sweet. He has their red velvet crepe cake which was nicely not too sweet, great texture, but it went kind of south when he ate it with the accompanying ice cream as it must have been buttercream between the layers, because he said it got weirdly greasy as it chilled. The coconut lava toast tho.... insanely good. Think honey toast with a coconut condensed tasting \"lava\" inside. Super generously buttered, matcha on top, strawberries... way more than I expected and such a great way to experience my first ever \"honey toast\". Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This  place  is  the  best . We go here all the time after our first visit and amazing first impression. One of the guys at the counter even speaks Russian so to a Russian family, that's quite a trophy."}
{"text":"Came here the other day w/ my fam. My sister tried this place before & a ton of my friends have been raving about it. 

I ordered the green tea crepe cake & the taro iced tea. I'm in love with anything green tea, however I was disappointed with the crepe cake :( not sure if it was just my taste buds, but I didn't care for it. I did like the taro iced tea though! Not too sweet, it was just right. Eric ordered a Nutella frappe & the coffee cake. We both agreed his drink was too strong, and tasted more like coffee than Nutella. Maybe it was a mistake? Coffee cake was okay. 

We took bites of my siblings honey toasts. One was regular & one was with mango. We both enjoyed them & that's something we will definitely be back for! 

I really appreciated the great service they gave us and the fancy presentation of the desserts."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 84/100

IS SWEET. The name intrigued me. What inspired them to call it that? Is it a catch phrase? Is it all sweet? Is it sweet to be loved by them? 

I give this place a 3.5, but because of the interior decor and customer service I'm rounding up to 4 stars. 

This is a great place to go to with a group of friends. 

Here is what we tried: 

chocolate cake - 2/5 - bleh. I've had my share of chocolate cake from a variety of bakeries and homemade, and this was bland. Disappointing. :-( 
green tea crepe cake - 4/5 
red velvet crepe cake - 4/5 

The most memorable were the crepe cakes. This is the first time I've heard of such a thing and it was better than the chocolate cake I had. The presentation of the desserts were creative. 

I didn't get to try the honey toast or drinks (b/c I have to watch my sugar intake) but my friends said they enjoyed it. 

What caught my eye here is the interior decor. The faux brick wall. I LOVE that shade of coral red. The different colored chairs and tables give it a whimsical feel. For some reason it feels like Alice in Wonderland. 

Another complaint my friends had: no mason jars. Not a deal breaker, but still. 

Great service. We asked for iced water and they immediately refilled the complimentary water dispenser. They happily took our group photos for us. I will be back to try their other drinks."}
{"text":"Came to this wonderfully peaceful dessert cafe in the Chinatown area. Very nicely decorated with mix matched furniture. It's across the street from Southwest Gas on Spring Mountain. The drinks are very good and the desserts was nice also...had chocolate cake and creme br√ªl√©e. Would have been nice if they served light snacks. Will  come back for sure, especially when you want a nice quiet place to meet friends or on your own. They have Grand opening specials at the moment, don't miss...support your local family businesses.:-)"}
{"text":"Finally trying this matcha crepe cake. Verdict... Drum roll...  its soft and fluffy and just the right blend of matcha and sweetness. Highly recommend. Pair it with their matcha latte."}
{"text":"5 STARS ALONE ON THE PLAYLIST CAUSE IT'S SOOOO GOOOD. 

On a real note though the coffee here is actually really good. I ended up getting the hot white mocha. Soooooo good and it's the right amount of sweet which just leaves you wanting more. My friend ended up with an iced matcha milk tea which she had no complaints about too. 

The interior of the place is very cutesy and photogenic. They have a red brick wall which seat 6 people. and other 2-3 seater tables scattered around. I came here on a monday afternoon and it was pretty empty making it a great place to study.

The menu they have seems pretty extensive enough to where I'm sure you'll find something you like caffeinated or not. 

Tip: It's not really hard to find, but it is easy to miss the turn into their plaza! So keep your eyes peeled!"}
{"text":"I'm sad as I write this review because this place was one of my favorite places to get drinks in Vegas but it is not anymore. My recent visit was such a disappointment!

I liked getting Thai Tea and other flavored teas here. Prices were reasonable. I guess you can say a little overpriced but most of the drinks at any cafe these days costs a bit more than franchised coffee shops like Starbucks and Coffee Bean. Nevertheless, I think I have to say goodbye to Is Sweet.

My boyfriend and I walked in after eating pho next door and there was only only 3 other people at the cafe. They took forever to order but yeah I ordered as soon as they were done. My order was simple; Thai Tea and Taro Frappe.

I waited and waited. As I see the time and the time printed on my receipt, it has been 12 minutes since. Theres 2 people working but come on. Making those 2 drinks shouldnt take more than 5 minutes. We finally received out drinks after 17 minutes of ridiculous wait and my boyfriend's so called Taro Frappe was very bland and tasteless. I dont know what Taro powder they use but it tasted nothing but just milk. To add, it wasnt sweet either. I asked them to make it sweeter and they did. Did it make it sweet? Not really. Maybe a tiny bit. It wasnt the flavor he or I was looking for in a typical Taro Frappe.

My Thai Tea was just as good as before. But I'm lactose intolerant so I couldnt drink much because I didnt have any lactaid with me. Should have asked for soymilk instead but I totally forgot they carry them. If you are lactose like me, please substitute with soy. They do charge extra for it but at least it will be worth to do so.

Tables were somewhat dirty. It wasnt wiped completely. I dont think they ever come out and clean the tables. I always see them busy behind the bar and I dont know whats keeping them so busy. My drinks came out way too late and I wasnt too satisfied with it.

Cutesy interior and tables & chairs are unique. However, if they dont speed up preparing your drinks, they will irritate other customers too. Perhaps hire more workers if they take THAT long making them. 

Parking is plenty and it is located in not-so-busy plaza so dont need to worry about that. They do have a restroom and it is clean."}
{"text":"I've never heard of honey toast!
To think I've been missing out all this time. 
Delicious!

Great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"This is a super cute place, but a little hard to find.   It's located at the very end of the strip mall when you enter.   I came here for their Matcha Green tea Crepe cake and my friend had the Honey toast.  The service here was very attentive and there was one person who took your order and one person that makes it. So it takes awhile for your food to come.  

The matcha green tea crepe cake was presented so beautifully.  There was a side of green tea cream that you can pour on to you cake, but i decided to opt out on it because i didn't want to eat too much sweets.   The crepe cake itself was not too sweet so it was pretty good.   But I didn't really taste the green tea in it. I felt like it was just a vanilla crepe cake.The  honey toast was good and the portion was pretty big for one person, so it's best to share.  Overall, i'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food! Zero stars for demanding ID with credit card purchase. This is an ignorant policy that I challenged the employees and manager on. Their ridiculous statement that this is for customer safety is just ignorant. Most people submit to this stupid demand even though it does nothing to prevent credit card fraud, and provides vital private information to be displayed to strangers who can us it to further assist identity theft. Demanding/requiring ID with Visa/MasterCard purchase is a violation of the agreement to accept these cards for a reason. This is a dumb policy that needs to be changed. *before anyone challenges me on this...please do your research. Demanding ID does nothing to prevent credit card fraud - it inconveniences customers and is not a requisite by issuing banks for for using cardsor accepting them.Credit card theives do not run to China Town and spend $16.00 on tea and cake."}
{"text":"Disappointing tea crepe cake. After all the high reviews I expected so much more but unfortunately got empty tasteless calories from this dessert. Yelp has done me over again :("}
{"text":"Their honey toast is extremely bomb no matter how you customize it.
It's been months since they'd opened, and their forks STILL taste like dirty coins. Uh..I don't want some sort of metal/paint poisoning, so I always end up reaching for a plastic spork.
Their waffle tasted like bland banana-flavored flour.
They will make you wait a long time versus people who ordered WAYYYY after you IF they ordered the same thing as you! wow. unfair. 40minutes just for our honey toast vs. another table getting it within 10minutes? Smart businesses know that it's important to PAY ATTENTION to the rate of sales for specific days of the week so that they can be prepared to be fair to customers and not potentially LOSE customers.
All of the employees are nice, though."}
{"text":"The honey toast here is da bomb!  We added strawberries, condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream...and it was seriously magical. The bread was perfectly toasted and still hot on arrival. You can actually smell the deliciousness cooking while waiting for your dessert. Strawberries were cut into little pieces so you could have them in every bite. And whoever thought of adding condensed milk and honey with bread is a genius. I think it's a little big for one person so definitely bring someone to share. Price wasn't bad...around $8 for the whole thing. However, It can get expensive if you go crazy on toppings and sauce. Keep it simple, that way you can still enjoy the honey toast and not break your wallet. 

Free wifi"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem tucked away in the corner of the shopping center in china town! The name of the place perfectly matches its environment. I pulled up and seen tables and chairs outside with warm lights creating like a night garden appearance. Inside it looks even more cuter like a vintage, tea party type of look. It's great for friends to hang out and especially couples to go on dates! My friends and I decided to sit outside because they were very busy at night on a Friday night around 8/9pm. It's still cool out so it was a great place to drink tea and eat some honey toast! 

They have the 10% off per drink check-in deal so don't for get to do that if you buy a drink! My friends and I ordered tea, Thai Tea, Honeydew, and a type of Lemon tea (I forgot the actual name), and we ordered a Honey Toast with Vanilla ice-cream, bananas, and strawberries. The total came out to about $24. It is pricey because of the Honey Toast, you pay by the toppings. Base price for the Honey Toast is $5 and whatever toppings you want you get charged for it. Ex. 1 scoop of vanilla ice-cream is $1.50 or condensed milk drizzled on top of your Toast is $0.75 charge. Probably that's the only down side to this place is the topping price because the quantity given is not as much. The employee's are nice, my first time they took out a menu for me to look at and didn't rush me. They deliver the dessert to wherever you're sitting at and they bus your table when you leave. I also love how they have a water dispenser on the side for customers to drink after they're done, it's helpful for customers like me who needs to wash down all of that sweetness! I recommend this place, its cute and great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I visited Is Sweet yesterday with my boyfriend! It was cute and nicely decorated inside. Although there weren't many people inside, some of the tables were dirty. They did clean while we were there though. We ordered Honey Toast with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, and condensed milk. It was pretty good and fairly large, so one was enough for two people. Overall, will visit again."}
{"text":"This place is really cute, I like the decorations and they play good music! We got the sizzling brownie and two teas. The non caffeine teas tasted just about the same but they were both good. The brownie is amazing! Would definitely recommend. It's a little hard to find so go all the way to the end and it's hidden back there."}
{"text":"This is the first time we came here, and we are definitely coming back. Love the crepe cakes and smoothies. Great place to have desserts."}
{"text":"First off, this place is super hard to find. When I walked in I thought the place was super cute! My cousin ordered the green tea crepe cake and a green tea frappe while I ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The place wasn't busy and we didn't wait a long time to get our order. The presentation of the cakes was very nice and garnished with fruit. I thought the chocolate cake was good but super sweet but what do you expect out of a triple chocolate cake right? The green tea crepe was okay. My cousin didn't really like it very much but I thought it was mediocre. The green tea frappe was delicious and was not too sweet and had a good flavor. I would come back to try the various drinks they offer. The service is very nice and helpful. Overall it was good. :-)"}
{"text":"Came in 10 minutes before they closed and was told by a young girl behind the counter, that they were already closed. They still had several tables of people inside. I mentioned to the gal that the sign says closing is at midnight. She replied,  that they were not making any more food and the kitchen is closed. After working in restaurants over the years, you still serve the customer. I wasn't asking for anything complicated or would take long. Just had a sweet tooth and was looking for something quick and sweet."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Banoffie Pie
Honey Toast with Strawberry Ice Cream and Vanilla Pudding
Cinnamon Coffee Cake with Candied Pecans
Nutella Mousse

Located in back of the Spring Mountain plaza housing Viet Noodle IS SWEET has received a fair bit of praise ever since opening doors in the middle of 2015, and with several desserts served to compliment a broad-ranging menu of coffee and teas the cozy spot shows well for an Locals-only sort of spot, though prices are often comparable to the likes of Bouchon on Jean-Philippe.

Open late and offering free WiFi, the staff exceedingly pleasant if not particularly pressed for pace, those visiting IS SWEET are likely to be tempted by several cute confections in addition to honey toast and waffles made-to-order, the quoted preparation time of fifteen minutes proving a low-ball estimate as a lone barrista and man in the kitchen struggled with orders despite only a half-dozen total guests.

Levied a tab of $25.57 for four desserts and tap water before adding a tip, a tasting of IS SWEET began with a small slice of British favorite Banoffie Pie, the flavor of fruit largely overwhelming the toffee amidst the creamy base as drizzles of chocolate and caramel further compromised the experience, a block of honey toast proving far better crafted with a base price of $4.00 boosted by a $1.00 dollop of Vanilla pudding plus $1.25 for ice cream without which the toasted bread would seem to be a waste.

Taking two more treats for home, the Nutella Mousse apparently carrying a premium entirely as a result of the artistry involved, suffice it to say that at a cost of $6 the light dessert was most certainly not worth a buck-fifty a bite, the far better taste and value found in a 'coffee cake' that defied convention, the hefty notes of cinnamon smoothed by creamy frosting while honey glazed nuts added  texture and finesse traditionally reserved to fine-dining and plated sweets.

***Unfortunately a bit too precious for its own good, even the honey toast which seems like a good deal turning out to be a bit pricey when accounting for portion after adding ice cream, IS SWEET is perhaps best visited with a group intent on sharing and sampling, though smallish portions may even make that a stretch."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy spot to study or talk with friends.

Environment: The interior is on par with many other cute coffee/ dessert shops in Vegas, complete with bright colors, an assortment of seating, and an open layout. The overall feeling is very cozy and would serve as a great place to catch up with a friend, go on a quick date, or even spend a couple hours studying. They are open late as well.

Food: I have tried their green tea layered cake, honey toast, as well as their mango iced tea and all were light and fresh. The honey toast stood out as you can add as many toppings as you live, including fresh fruits, sauces, ice cream, etc. Additionally, they have several drink selections from coffees, blended drinks, juices and teas. The food is light and comfortable and the drinks would be great to sip on while studying late at night.

Service: Cashiers are friendly and personable. Additionally, sometimes the seating areas can be covered in dirty dishes from previous customers, however the staff is rather quick at bussing and cleaning the tables so that you are never stuck waiting for your favorite seat.

Overall, this Is Sweet is nothing new for Vegas, but it is still great for having a quick snack or for spending hours studying, so I will come back."}
{"text":"First time here and it is a very relaxing environment with a very pleasant staff. I came on Easter Sunday to just get away and it was just what the day needed. The coffee cake was moist and tasty and my latte had a rich creamy foam. It was a good day."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I was a little hesitant about ordering a frappe but I was craving something cold and love Nutella so I ended up getting the Nutella frappe.  Omg it is addicting. I can't even put it down!!!  I was afraid it was going to have an overbearing taste of pure sugar like how Nutella can be but it actually isn't.   Just the right amount of sweetness.  Not too sweet where you might get diabetes and not too bland either.  Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop. Looks family owned. They have various teas, coffees and frapps to sell as well as desserts. The crepe cakes, which are overendeared by Asian clientele these days were good. 

They should probably hire some more people though. When I came in, only two to three tables were clean and every other one had food, plates and drinks still left on their from their previous customers. Should probably work on that."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a group of friends. Decor was an Asian hipster vibe and they had this pink brick wall that stood out. (Good for Instagram photos) We all got crepe cakes and one of my other friends got the taro slush. We got the crepe cakes in green tea and strawberry. We also got to choose the type of ice cream. I think you have to be careful about the extra toppings because they can add up.

{"text":"I'm super biased... lol but it's really hard to not want to love the service the owner provides.

Maybe that's because he recognized Bun and me after a month..and QQ Boba didn't recognize either of us and we went 3 times a week for one week...

The owner is super sweet and I love the extensive menu - I've enjoyed the Iced GT latte and am excited to come back to try other items. The beverages come in mason jars or something very classy which suits the environment IS SWEET is trying to give that LV lacks. The tallest mason jar is I believe 24oz if not 32oz and a regular would be 16oz.

I would say skip the honeydew frappe just cause it's the honeydew powder ice blended and taste bleh - but that's just me personally with honeydew that I am picky about it. Other than that...

Go go go!"}
{"text":"Ordered the green tea crepe cake and it was really good! Couldn't really tell that it was green tea flavor but was still super delicious and light. Chocolate ice cream was good as well. The dish was beautifully played and the decor was very cute. Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nothing I love more than a cute quiet place for you and a friend to catch up in. I love their Thai tea. Their coffee is always awesome and strong. The place just has this ambiance of comfort. They're always nice and attentive."}
{"text":"The interior is very nice, menu simple and the dessert so unique it's worth anyone checking out. They added strawberries to our cheesecake for us and the honey toast wow was it good! We did vanilla ice cream, strawberries with peanut butter drizzle on our honey toast. Turned out to be a perfect combo!

Dessert lover? This place is for you."}
{"text":"I ordered their lychee iced tea, green tea crepe cake and honey toast. All of it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a quick turn around trip to Vegas. I wanted to try the honey toast. Oh boy! It was good! The lady was sooo helpful and genuinely nice! I wish I had gone here when I lived here years ago! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cute little spot to eat and relax at ;)"}
{"text":"Very small place , But it makes you feel like u are in Paris it feels romantic and it's has very unique delicious deserts must try.... there about $6.00"}
{"text":"Is sweet IS a tasty place.

I have wanted to try this place for sometime, and it was worth the wait. I shared the red velvet crepe cake, tiramusi, and the bear shape mousse dessert. All were very decadent, and required some skill to make. I pick the tiramusu as my favorite. It was light, but you could still get the coffee flavor. Overall, all were great bakes! I expected the prices, $4 to $6.50 for artistry. The decor was fun, and a cozy space to enjoy our desserts. 
I want to take away 1/2 a star but that is not possible. I take one away because the lady behind the counter forgot my husband's coffee, and we waited to see if she remembered. After finishing one dessert, he reminded her and she prominently served the coffee. It happens, but gotta deduct. Regardless, I will come back when I have a sweet feeling."}
{"text":"Ambiance: convenient desserts shop, big tables available for groups 

Service: fast and friendly

Food: variety choices for drinks but limited for desserts
  Matcha Crepe Cakes - **** great presentation for the layer cake, though the green sauce was a bit over-sweet for me 

Price: very inexpensive, less than $10 per order"}
{"text":"Honestly, not the best green tea crepe cake.  It seemed to be kind of dense compared to the one at gyu-kaku.  They have a variety of desserts, but seems the drink menu is the more extensive option.  The service was a little slow as well, since one person was making drinks, serving drinks, serving desserts, and serving as the cashier.  Definitely need more help at least during the busy hours or on weekends.  The drinks seemed solid though. We had a dark chocolate hot chocolate and it was nice and rich, none of this watery stuff that you get at other places.  10% off all items for now...we didn't even need to check in on Yelp to redeem it."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday dessert. Found this place on yelp for desert places in Chinatown. My son ordered the ice cream bowl and enjoyed his green tea and vanilla scoops. 

My wife ordered a red velvet late(AWESOME!!!!)

My daughter, wife and I wanted the coconut lava toast but they didn't have it available, we next ordered the honey toast with chocolate ice cream and Nutella; they didn't have any chocolate ice cream..... or strawberry. We ended up deciding on the vanilla since it was that or green tea flavor. 
The food was good the toast was soft but with crispy edges from the oven. Not too sweet either which we were all happy about.

We will be back for sure when we are in the area, just hoping that they have their whole menu this time as we were disappointed with our options when we ordered."}
{"text":"The only reason why I found out about this place was because of my brother. He recently moved to Vegas and this was one of the spot he took us to. I most definitely glad he did because I just LOVE it!

I have a sweet tooth and this place was just perfect. The area it's located in is a bit hidden because its in the inner corner part of the plaza but their sign is visible in big letters \"IS SWEET\". 

We ordered the matcha crepe cake and loved it! We even came back for seconds the next day and tried other flavors of crepe cakes. Matcha flavor was definitely our favorite. The first bite was so good. It was soft, fresh, light and simply perfect! 

If ever youre in Vegas I would recommend hitting this place out and I can guarantee it wouldnt be a disappointment. 

A relaxed environment to get work done. As well as a great hang out place to chill with friends. Definitely coming back here everytime Im in town!"}
{"text":"Ordered the vanilla crepe & honey toast!! So good! Love the light flavored dessert! Beautiful presentation too!!"}
{"text":"So after my original posting I said I wouldn't come here+ on a regular. BUT! I wanted to share the sweetness with my gang and so we came in one night to indulge.  We ordered their honey toast with all these toppings with ice cream for the children's delight and boy were they delighted. They're children, of course they'd be! Lol. I was able to bite into it myself and thought it was perfectly buttered and toasted. It certainly was worth the treat!

I did order their Thai lemon iced tea a couple times over to-go and found that it didn't taste as good when drinking it inside...in their cute litter mason jar...it tasted a little bland and watered down both times.

None-the-less, I think it's a pretty cute place and a solid option if you have honey brick toast on the mind."}
{"text":"Came in to try the green tea and vanilla crepe cakes and just wasn't impressed. Perhaps I hold the taste of crepes to too high of a pedestal (my friend makes awesome crepe cakes) but I could tell that something was missing here. 

The best way I can explain this judgment is through the phrase \"all talk, no bite.\" Is Sweet offers a beautiful display of their cake, topped with chocolate drizzle and an arrangement of strawberries and oranges to the side. As for the taste, This place lives up to its name. Is SWEET. It is SWEET, and I think on the more extreme side of the spectrum. 

What hit me was the texture of the whipped cream. Not fluffy, smooth, but rather patchy. In my opinion, the sauce given to you did nothing to add to the dessert's flavor profiles, but rather gives way to more artificial sugars and sugar overloads. Rather than a nice delicate touch to compliment a crepe cakes delicate texture, I was overloaded with just too much. Not impressed and not sure I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"One thing I like about this place is the interior space. It's a very open and spacious layout, and having the large glass windows letting in daylight is a huge plus. It's usually not too busy here during the day, which I like. It gets a little busier at night, but I've always been able to find a table. I've tried their iced caf√© latte, iced matcha milk tea, iced sesame milk tea, and green tea crepe cake. I've liked the matcha and sesame milk teas, but the latte wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. Because the matcha is powder based, it is a bit grainy as you drink it, and same with the sesame too with a bit more sweetness. Their green tea crepe cake was okay. If you've ever had Lady M's crepe cake, you'll think this one doesn't quite come close. The flavor isn't too bad, but more so the texture is a bit off. The crepe part of the cake has a hint of almost a playdoh texture...and just the green color of it isn't so much a matcha green, but a pine green food coloring. I probably wouldn't get the green tea crepe cake again, but am willing to try other desserts on the menu. 
The staff here is very friendly and service has always been good. I would come back knowing the fact that it wouldn't be too crowded, and just quiet enough to relax or get work done."}
{"text":"Went here and I was pleasantly impressed with the delicious warm latte and dessert was bomb dot com! I had to savor every bite! :D definitely recommend if you wanna go get some sugar on that tooth! ;)"}
{"text":"The best HONEY BREAD EVER...so good. My fiance said \"The best dessert I have ever had.\" 10 stars."}
{"text":"I got a piece of green tea crepe cake. I was purposely looking for crepe cake after I ate in Japan. It was good, almost like in Japan. Taste was different then what I tryed but still good.  Also, they put pieces of mango fruits on the side I believe.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas I get to tried honey toast at this place and HANDS DOWN, this is the best honey toast I've had by far... staffs were all friendly and this place is crazy busy so you know what it means  and the first time I had it, I told my friend that I will have to come back because it is too good to have it just once, so I went back the next day for honey toast... again if you're in Las Vegas or planning to visit, I promise you that you will not regret trying out IS SWEET 
For anyone who like sweet, this place is a must :)"}
{"text":"When I find myself craving honey toast, Is Sweet is definitely my go to place. I've gone here a few times in the past whenever I was meeting with a friend and I always get there Honey Toast with Nutella and banana which also comes with whipped cream on the top. SO GOOD! Keep in mind it does take about 10-15 minutes for your honey toast to come out so hopefully you have some extra time to wait. 

Last time I was here, I was excited to try their Green Tea crepe cake since I'm a huge green tea/matcha fan! But sadly I was disappointed for my specific crepe cake barely had any Green Tea flavor at all in it - it just tasted like whipped cream. The green tea sauce was the only reason I finished it but without it, it would've just tasted like a bland whipped cream cake. 

They have a variety of other sweets as well including cheesecake, strawberry cake, tiramisu, banoffee, chocolate cake, and etc. 

Their drinks are also just average, I usually get the matcha latte or frappe. I asked if I could have it with almond milk but their only other substitute is Soy milk. 

Overall, great desserts if you're looking for something sweet but can be kind of kind of pricey especially with the honey toast since the toppings do add up."}
{"text":"IS SWEET ... IS OK.  

My friends and I ate at Viet Noodle Bar and yelped to find a boba/drink place and IS SWEET popped up ... last building in the corner.   

First if you're looking for boba they don't have it.  They have teas, smoothies, coffee, lattes, and desserts like honey toast, tiramisu, etc.

Note:  there is a disclaimer it takes at least 15 minutes to make their honey toast.  

I ordered lychee tea, and for $5 I would prefer a little more lychee, but the tea was good.  I would definitely order it again.       

The guy who took our order was nice and able to give us suggestions on alternatives to try.  

This place is a small cozy shop so if you want to study or meet up with a couple of friends, this place doesn't seem like it gets packed and there is free wi-fi for you.  Also don't forget to check into Yelp to get 10% off your drink !"}
{"text":"This is a great little hidden spot for some serious sweet tooth cravings! It's on Spring Mountain just east of Lindell in a little strip mall, all the way inside at the end. 

I got the matcha crepe cake and the Thai tea lava toast. Both were amazing and sooo delicious!! The crepe cake was really light and fluffy and the matcha flavor was very strong, just how I like it! The Thai tea lava toast was practically sinful! Perfectly toasted and when you cut into it the Thai tea lava soaks everything perfectly for some some delicious Thai tea flavor. 

The ambience is really light and refreshing, they had some really good music playing to enjoy while you eat your dessert. 

My only criticism is that nobody greeted us when we walked in or asked if we had any questions, didn't offer a menu, had to look for it ourselves. It's little things like that which really make a difference for me, but they were very nice when we actually ordered and when they brought our food. Definitely worth a visit and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Giving them a five just because of that scrumptious delightful FRENCH TOAST. My goodness! It's the best French toast I've ever had. I'd describe it as a high quality Mexican concha taste. The crepe cake wasn't bad either, but it tasted too much like egg. It was frothy and yummy though."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with great music and mediocre fare. I ordered a raspberry lemon iced tea and the green tea crepe cake with green tea ice cream. 

Raspberry lemon iced tea tasted like overly steeped lemon ice tea with no raspberry to be found. Nonetheless, it was refreshing after the heat and sweet. Served in a cute mason jar, of course. 

The green tea crepe cake came with green tea sauce, a stripe of blueberry syrup, and blueberries. The ice cream was extra. This was my first time having crepe cake and it was underwhelming. There was no green tea flavor and the crepes became gummy with the equally bland whipped cream between each layer. The green tea sauce did have good green tea flavor with no sweetness. This dish was edible because of the sweetness from the ice cream and blueberry syrup. And even then, the ice cream was icy in the middle. All this mediocrity was presented beautifully on a wooden paddle. 

The ambience is what saved this cafe, really. It is why I would come here again if I was in the area. Sure, the food wasn't great, the colorful decor was a bit run-down and verging on being tacky, and I was greeted by a random household trash can outside entrance. There was, however, good natural light and airflow, greenery I could look at outside, plenty of electric outlets for studying, clean bathrooms, great music, and beautifully presented food. All in all, I spent a nice afternoon sipping tea and relaxing in the middle of the bleak shopping-plaza-maze that is Chinatown and that's something to be valued in my book."}
{"text":"My friends and I study here all the time, literally. The food isn't the greatest, which I was why I stick with getting the Matcha Latte. The customer service is very good though!! Of course I'll be returning to do some studying"}
{"text":"Their lychee green tea is very refreshing, it's not overly sweet, perfect for those super hot Vegas days.  I love their green tea crepe cake, it's delicious.  However, the service is a bit slow even though we went there after 10pm and it's not busy."}
{"text":"The green tea crepe is way over hyped. It has a very strong after taste of green tea and it's definitely not sweet enough. BUT the honey toast is great. Perfect sweetness. Definitely add fresh fruits"}
{"text":"The coffee was outstanding. I had latte with soy milk and a matcha slice of cake. The cake was super light, a little matcha flavor, and not very sweet. It was layered with a fluffy whipped cream and we really enjoyed it. The coffee was smooth and full bodied. We got there at 11PM and it was still busy. The atmosphere was pleasant and  little trendy."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the previous visits were not really that memorable.  However, the third time's the charm.  I met up with a couple of gal pals who've never been and we shared several items on the menu:  honey toast, matcha crepe cake, taro latte, matcha latte, and a caramel iced latte.  The honey toast that we ordered had mango, strawberry, kiwi, and a scoop of strawberry ice cream and it was the BOMB!  Seriously.  I've had honey toast at a few other places around town and this version is probably in my top two, it was that good.  I also liked the taro latte the best of the three drinks.  The matcha crepe cake is one item that is Instagrammed very often from this spot and there's no doubt that it's lovely to see.  However, the taste doesn't match its looks.  It's not terrible, but it's just ok to me. I know that matcha is not normally too sweet to begin with, but this cake needed a bit more flavor for my taste.  It could also be that the excellence of the honey toast overshadowed the crepe cake, so give it a whirl if you are a matcha lover.  And if you've never had honey toast before, come here for a sweet first experience."}
{"text":"After going to this place so many times I didn't have the chance to review it. Shame on me. Very impressed on the presentation they delivered for their dessert.

This place does live up for the hype of their crepe cake. I believed this is the only place that offers crepe cake Becuase it's very hard to make.

I always order the matcha crepe cake, it's my most favorite. The drinks are very good and the sweetness level is just right. This is my place to go for good dessert since they offer crepe cake."}
{"text":"I went to vegas last week and searched on yelp for a decent dessert place. Stop by and tried their crepe cake. Thumb up"}
{"text":"Omg this place was amazing. The honey toast is something fantastic. It was yumm In my tum. One of the best tasting deserts I've had. They have many different coffee choices. The place is a little on the dirtier side but that can be rectified by some simple housekeeping. Don't that deter you from coming in and getting a treat and coffee."}
{"text":"Loveeeee this place. Be ready to wait for the honey toast but it is totally worth it... highly recommend their lychee iced tea too"}
{"text":"New business! Believe the hype.

DESSERT
We ordered the green tea crepe cake and the creme brulee to share. Both were so delicious. I especially enjoyed the green tea crepe cake because it was very light and not sweet, which I prefer. 

DRINK
The espresso machine was broken at the time so no coffee :(. But we ordered a pot of rose green tea to share and it was pretty standard. Good taste, not overpowering with floral scent but maybe too mild. Their lychee drink was refreshing, albeit a little sweet for me.

PRICE POINT
I would say this place is a little pricey for the amount you get, especially for the tea. The teas are pretty expensive when they don't taste as such. The desserts obviously had a lot of care put into them so I wouldn't mind splurging every once in a while. It also helped that we went during the grand opening so our order was 30% off.

AMBIENCE & LOCATION
The decor is very cutesy and comfortable, so you'll probably be seeing a lot of aerial photos on instagram. The place is small so it can't fit a lot of people, though there is a work table that fits 6. Everything about this place is adorable and it seems like your neighborhood cafe you would find somewhere more pedestrian-friendly than Vegas. Nice little patio outside and ample parking. Location is great -- not too difficult to find but just enough privacy. 

SERVICE
The owners are friendly and are quick to answer any questions. They don't mind if you chill and use their wifi to get work done! I can see this being a good study spot (although it does close a little early).


Is Sweet's desserts are not very sweet, and I think that's sweet!"}
{"text":"Had the honey toast with strawberries, condensed milk and ice cream. I like the fact that you can \"build\" your own honey toast but it can get a little expensive. The toast was much smaller than other places but overall it was good but pricey."}
{"text":"Delish!!ordered greentea crepe layered cake n tiramisu...
Presentations was greate then I expected!and staff was really nice and friendly.
We will def go back sometime soon!!

I wanna try another cake"}
{"text":"Loved the honey toast! I ordered it with several toppings including strawberries, bananas, almonds, condensed milk, strawberry sauce, and strawberry cheesecake ice cream. It's a huge portion so a friend and I shared. 

We also ordered the coconut cake which was just OK. Would likely not order it again, my friend mentioned tasting some sort of bitter after taste when eating it. 

Pistachio latte was delicious as well. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The portion are big enough to share, the price can add up when you add the extra toppings.  The desserts are really good the bad thing was for ice cream they only had chocolate and green tea there wasn't any vanilla or strawberry but definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Honey Toast with green tea ice cream!!   nuff said :-)"}
{"text":"You know...for a place that's called is sweet, some of the beverages really aren't sweet. For example, their taro and matcha milk teas are barely sweet at all.

If you're looking for a good beverage, stick to the iced teas."}
{"text":"MMMkay so after my visit on Monday 9-12-16 at 7PM I gotta bump this place up to five stars.  

$22.32 got me a nutella frapp√©, a chocolate mousse cake, and a slice of strawberry cake.  

The nutella frappe was one of the best shakes/drinks I've ever had.  The consistency was so smooth and creamy.  The presentation was gorgeous in a clear plastic glass with chocolate syrup artistically drizzled down the slides and topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream.  The drink was not too sweet but rich and decadent.  I was in chocolatey heaven.  I highly recommend this drink! 

The chocolate mousse cake is shaped like an adorable little bear's head and It was so pretty I was hesitant to eat it.  Cracking the milk chocolate exterior revealed and rich and satisfying chocolate mousse atop a moist and chocolately disk of cake. It was absolutely delightful.  

The strawberry cake was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  It was absolutely gorgeous with it's piped decorations, pocky sticks, and tiny chocolate hello kitty head.  The pink cake was layered with the most delicious cream filling and fresh strawberries.  It's like the best strawberry shortcake ever invented.  I wish I could eat one of these every day.  

Perhaps I was too harsh on this place the first time I went...after giving it a second try and finding items I like I had to revise my previous opinion.  I'd definitely recommend coming here now."}
{"text":"Super cute place! Desserts were delicious! Thai tea was authentic and fresh.. Nutella milk tea was fantastic!! Also ordered the vanilla crepe cake and it was very creamy and tasty!! Atmosphere was pleasant.. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here on Valentines Day. Had the green tea crepe cake. My hubby got the red velvet boba drink and I got the matcha. A little too thick in consistency in my opinion but taste was great. Excited to go back and eat more desserts."}
{"text":"Ended up trying it the same day my friend posted an IG about this place. Great little cafe to chill with a few friends. Definitely do not recommend a big group as seating is limited. 

Presentation is really nice and I was pleased with the service. The guy informed me of some specials and that's when I remembered they had crepes. 

Crepes - two flavor: vanilla and green tea. I did get the green tea and one of my friends got the vanilla but I preferred the vanilla in the end. Green tea is a hit or miss for me sometimes depending on what it is. 

There's a lot of drink choices that I had to take more than a few minutes to decide. Ended up with mango fruit smoothie but probably would not get that again. 

Overall, great little place and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here in a business trip and I decided to try something new in the area. I have looked up and found some nice pictures here, so I decided to give it a try. I had a waffel with chocolate ice cream and a mango slushes. It was incredibly delicous! The place is warm and cozy. Highly recommended and definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden in a small shopping center. This place is a hidden gem. I highly recommend the honeybread with strawberries and the cheesecake. Please keep in mind the honeybread is large and is a perfect dessert for 2 people. I did not feel this place was expensive. For the quality of the food and service it was worth it. I really want to try the ham and cheese toast."}
{"text":"I hate to this because its my first ever review but I just wanna put it out there that this place sucks! Food was good but the customer service sucks!  
Its not a kid friend place at all and the whole time we were there,  looked like we were just bothering them. Never really acknowledge us and just felt very unwanted! Very rude and probably never going back there at all! Rude ass people, sucks!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden like a treasure in a small quite plaza you will see only Vietnamese restaurant up front by the entrance.I found this place right next to my friends apartment. And the business just open and now has buy one drink and get another one 50% off, why not!! We decided to go in and yes they have FREE WIFI. Its a nice surprise that this place is really really cute and comfy, also on the menu they have lots of drinks to choose from. I had hot matcha latte and NY cheesecake, both of them were pretty good but I was expecting to see more dessert since the place open up for drinks and desserts!! Anyway since their staff were really nice and helpful plus the drinks are good, the place is great for hanging out with friends. I will definitely go a second time."}
{"text":"I came here for some coffee to wake me up for the long day ahead. The atmosphere fits the environment, quiet with acoustic indie music to mellow everyone out. I ordered the double shot espresso and that really woke me up along with a piece of cheesecake. The cheesecake really did it for me, it's not overdone nor artificially flavored. Very subtle in taste and as creamy as you can imagine. The garnishes of blueberries and strawberries were nice to pick at as well.
I'd recommend if you're in the neighborhood and wanting a nice way to treat yourself or after a meal and are looking to top of the night."}
{"text":"Cute dessert spot in Chinatown.
Got the green tea crepe cake. 
Just be prepared to wait for your dessert as the turn around isn't that quick.
I would come back here to try other things off the menu. I love a city with dessert bars and IS SWEET is a good option for anyone with a sweet tooth.
Also finding this place can be a little rough as it's hidden at the end of the strip mall.
Parking not a problem.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The desserts are not bad but they aren't the best I've ever had either.   Given that they are extremely overpriced makes this place not one that I would go back to.   

Beware that when you order honey toast, everything you add that isn't the toast or honey is an addition of $1 or more! 

Also I paid 4 bucks for a lemonade.   

For 2 of us 2 desserts and 2 drinks cost more that dinner itself that night!  Over $30!

I will say that the restaurant itself is super cute and the staff was friendly.   I am glad I went (great photo opportunity) but I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Loved this quaint little dessert/coffee place! Just a couple of workers there putting together the orders, cute decor that was mismatched but was so cute and made it a home-y experience. It was a quiet and pleasant experience, not to mention the fact that our waffle was absolutely delicious! We ordered it with strawberries, bananas and nutella...it was to die for! If I were closer, I'd go ALL the time. They have free wi-fi as well, making it great for little lunch or study breaks."}
{"text":"The Thai tea is delicious and so is the honey toast! The seating is really limited, so just hope it's not busy!"}
{"text":"Not a good customer service... we had some questions about the desserts and the cashier didn't help at all. She had that \"I don't want to be here\" attitude. First and last time there..."}
{"text":"Great desserts, love the environment. Pricey on the desserts, but they're decent. The entire experience is what you pay for."}
{"text":"Came here and got the volcano (a layered chocolate drink that tasted like a chocolate smoothie), their layered matcha cake (thin green tea crepe and whip cream layers) and mango shaved ice.  We came on a Friday evening at about 9pm and were able to find seating right away, which was great.  Our food came out pretty quickly and everything tasted good.  The presentation was beautiful.  All that said, there was no dessert that I looked back at and said it was so amazing I HAD to go back.  For that reason, it's a solid 4 star place for me."}
{"text":"Honestly, I really love the vibe of this place and food & drinks they serve. This is my favorite place hands down to get honey toast and I think they do an amazing job.
The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because of the poor customer service I encountered the other day. I ordered a honey toast with two toppings and I only got a honey toast with one scoop of strawberry ice cream, which isn't what I ordered. Right away when I got my order and noticed, I told the girl who took my order that this wasn't what I ordered. She acted very unapologetic and said \"you were already charged for this, if you want the extra toppings you have to pay (x) dollars\". I checked my receipt to see what I was charged for and it didn't even say. After this she just walked away. In the end I sat there disappointed and sad with my friend while eating an unsatisfactory honey toast.
Anyways. This is the first time that I encountered bad service here and I think it may be because they're new employees who didn't start out with the business. I'll still be going back to Is Sweet but I hope that the customer service improves and that encounters like that don't happen ever again."}
{"text":"After reading a ton of Yelp reviews and being a new fan of Honey Toast I knew I had to try this place out. The interior reminds me of an Alice in Wonderland tea house and there is lots of table space. The parking lot, however, is small and quite packed. 

The coffee and food menu is very straight forward but I already knew what I wanted. Give me that Honey Toast and put all the Nutella on it! You can go a bit crazy with all the toppings they offer but I'm a simple gal and I went basic with Nutella and vanilla ice cream. This thing was huge. There were two of us blondes who love to eat and we barely put a dent in it. Shame on us. 

Their latte art was beautiful and the milk was steamed to temperature perfection. I totally see who people love this place. I'm totes a fan."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner because we were craving something sweet and this had popped up on yelp!

We came around 830 and thankfully it wasn't busy at the time so we were able to get our orders in right away as a flock of customers entered the joint.

The place is very decorative, they a red brick wall with some frames and also some shelving work with some nice designs hanging.  They have your standard table but they also have a mini table which felt like I was having tea and a playhouse. 

On to the food.
We ordered a taro flavored frappe and it tasted ok. Nothing really special about it so we give that one 3/5.
However,
We also ordered a honey toast with ice cream and bananas and that was so delicious! The bread was perfectly baked, ice cream was firm and creamy, and the bananas were flavorful. They also added some whip cream on the side which made the presentation appealing. We give this one a 5/5. 

The only thing they could work on is possibly speeding up the foos making process, maybe have some more workers during night shift so that one person is not making all the food! It took a while for our honey toast to be ready!

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Desert is so delicious !!! They have an awesome honey toast !!! Drinks .. Coffee and all desert are all good with reasonable price ..."}
{"text":"I went to Is Sweet for honey toast while visiting Vegas. This location can be tricky to find if you're not from the area (located in the corner of a strip mall). Customers can customize their own honey toast or pick a signature flavor. I customized my own honey toast. It was basically a kitchen sink honey toast (a variety of toppings). I didn't know what to expect since this was my first time ever trying honey toast. To my surprise, It Sweet honest toast was delicious. I ordered a Thai iced tea as well. It Sweet Thai iced tea was good. Service was polite. The restaurant has a nice ambience. It's a cool place for catching up with friends or dessert date night. It Sweet is a good choice for honey toast in Vegas. I give Is Sweet a 4.5 rating."}
{"text":"My first thought once I walked in was, wow this place looks pretty chill. The employees were very professional and our drinks were brought straight to me and my friends. Definitely gonna be back for sure."}
{"text":"Their iced coffee was amazing !! You must try their honey toast with vanilla ice cream and condensed milk. A very charming local coffee shop to visit. Great atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place right now. Honey toast has been my jam on a off the past few years but this place makes it just the way I like; warm, crisp on the outside, multiple options for toppings and and beautiful hunk of ice cream to balance it all out. My usual is decked out in Nutella, strawberries and vanilla ice cream running about $10. But oh so worth it! They also offer crepe cakes, mousse cakes and various caffeine beverages and a few specialties like pistachio or Nutella lattes. 

Other features are outlets if you can snag a table by the wall. Obscure mismatched furniture for varying group sizes. Outdoor seating as well. 

I'll be back for you, my sweet!"}
{"text":"I remember reading reviews about Is Sweet here on Yelp and finally came here about a week ago. In fact, we liked it so much that we have been here twice in the past week! Its a cute dessert cafe with a hip vibe. Sort of feels like you are somewhere in LA while you are here. So far, I have tried 3 items from their menu:

-Strawberry Cheesecake Shaved Ice: the shaved ice was very light and not too sugary. However, it also came with a generous amount of vanilla ice cream, cheesecake bites and strawberries. This one is definitely my favorite!

-Matcha Crepe Cake: never had a crepe cake before, but I did like the layers of the cake and how it was so light that you don't feel as guilty eating it! I would have preferred the matcha sauce to be a little more tasty, but overall I liked it.

-Honey Toast: haven't had this one for years and it was very good! I definitely feel guilty eating this one, but how can you resist warm toasted bread with honey, ice cream and condensed milk?

Loved the nice presentation of all their desserts and each one is big enough to share between 2 people. Don't expect fast service because it will take them a while to bring out your order. Also, this place is a little difficult to find since it is hidden at the end of a strip mall and you can't really see it from the street. 

Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Is Sweet is the perfect place to chill, hangout, and study if you forgot about that essay due tomorrow! It's very quiet and cozy, and has a variety of treats to choose from. My boyfriend and I come here solely for the crepe cakes, which are phenomenal and to die for! They have a light and airy taste, so you can enjoy something sweet without feeling gross at the end. They're $6.50, and you can buy ice cream for an additional $1.50 (always. buy. the. ice cream guys... ice cream makes everything better.) The workers are always nice and helpful, and the food is usually delivered very fast. If you come here, definitely try the crepe cakes, because I promise you won't be the same person after (and you might develop a small addiction... don't blame me though!)"}
{"text":"Man this place sucked. 
Lets start with their location.  It's in the corner of this small plaza where you can't see anything. 
Second thing is price. This place is a joke for the price it is charging for their drinks and cakes. 
Last thing food. We wanted to try another desert spot in Vegas after Sweet Raku. We came here to try their layered cake and strawberry cake. They didn't have the strawberry cake because they don't have enough business to sell everything on the menu. The gent taking my order said some days we have some days we don't. The cake had no flavor, it was a just ehh. Also ordered a kiwi slush and a mango smoothie. Basically had a sip of the mango smoothie and left it because it tasted like crap. The milk didn't even blend with the mango concentrate and ice. Nasty. Won't return."}
{"text":"This place is really cute inside and the thai iced tea was delicious. My friends got some desserts and they enjoyed it pretty well. I appreciate the check-in deals, definitely want to come back here when I visit again."}
{"text":"Subtle, but delicious crepe cakes! Make sure you add ice cream to make this another bomb.com dessert. 

My party and I ordered the Vanilla and Match Crepe cakes with their respective ice cream. It was relatively priced and arrived within minutes.

Decor was cute and the place was clean. No complaints there.

Make sure you smother the crepes with the accompanying syrup for that delicious richness.

Overall, I'd go again."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by Is Sweet after dinner down the street. We were both in the mood for something sweet but the menu and items in the case weren't too enticing. 

I felt I had to get something since the shop was so small and I felt awkward walking out without ordering anything. My friend decided against ordering. I got the honeydew frap and sat and waited. 

My drink was overly sweet and had an artificial flavor I didn't enjoy. My friend tried a sip and had the same reaction. I sipped as much as I could and tossed it in the trash.

A lackluster visit leaving me with little interest in returning."}
{"text":"We ordered green tea crepe cake, strawberry cake, chocolate cake and cappuccino. Everything is good but little pricey."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and the owners are really nice and serve you everything. Great little desserts Also! When ordering the honey toast I do suggest picking an in season fruit, because some of the fruits might not be as sweet and ripe as you expect! The matcha crepe cake was my favorite so far, not too sweet, just perf'."}
{"text":"Great little cafe at the end of a shopping Plaza on spring mountain. The people are really friendly, the menu good and this honey toast dessert was amazeballs! Not too sweet, just right with tea after dinner. There was good music in the background but not so loud that you can't have a good conversation. I will definitely be back."}
