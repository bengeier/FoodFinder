{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but I wouldn't expect much else from an Oakland pizza place. I would still go back. They did have some student special that I think was $8 for a large one topping pizza."}
{"text":"Love Original Milano's pizza! It is the closest pizza to a NYC pizza that I could find in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, which tastes even better after a beer or two. The new location on Centre Ave is a perfect stop for when you need a quick bite."}
{"text":"The Pizza...     Most pizza that you will find in Oakland doesn't really satisfy beyond the fact that you're paying next to nothing for a large meal with leftovers (thank all us college kids for that!). It's hard to think of something better than a $5 pizza, served up most times before you've even pulled out your cash. However, Milano's pizza (under $3 for  cheese or pepperoni slice and $3.95 for primavera--more on this one later) gives you the closest experience you'll have anywhere around Oakland to the taste of New York's pizza. The crust is on the thinner side and thus has a nice crispiness to it. No floppy mess here! The sauce is seasoned well and the cheese actually has a flavorful bite to it. I thought the slice would've been indistinguishable from New York's product if the amount of cheese was toned down a bit.   Definitely try a classic slice to get an idea for what Milanos can really do while also tasting one of their specials. Go for the primavera, which has tomatoes, ricotta, mozzarella, and broccoli, if they have it. Maybe sounds like too much piled onto one slice but the juicy tomatoes, hot salty bite of the cheese and slight crunch of the broccoli just works!   They're not open all night like some places, just fyi."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Hands down my favorite pizza place in Oakland. There sandwiches are also really good. The prices are right around what you expect in the area. Only downside, place can get crazy busy during lunch time and creates a delay getting your food."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great staff, dropped by on a Monday at the shadyside plaza location and had a great time meeting the staff. Would recommend if you need a great joint for a pie!"}
{"text":"An hour and 15 minutes for a pizza when ordered at 6pm on a Wednesday??? Really??? They're lucky the pizza is pretty good and cheap."}
{"text":"Pizza came way late, which seems to happen every time I've ever ordered from them - this time, it took 2+ hours for delivery. Seems to be a recurring theme each time I order from these guys. Pizza is quite good, but terrible service and delivery times."}
{"text":"Hands down the best plain slice you can have in Oakland. The cheese has a nice sharpness and deep flavor. The sauce is perfectly tangy without being sweet, and surprisingly tastes like real tomatoes. The crust is crisp and has a bit of a salty bite to it. These three factors contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable pizza-eating experience.  Non-plain slices vary. The Spinach, Tomato, and Ricotta white slices are absolutely wonderful. Their spinach actually has flavor, the tomatoes are fresh, and the creamy ricotta compliments the tangy crust and salty cheese excellently. Their topped slices and pies actually have plenty of toppings, unlike some other pizza joints in Oakland (cough Pizza Sola cough). Mushrooms taste canned, which is not very pleasant.. Pepperoni is average, I prefer Sola's.   Other menu items again vary. Hoagies are average, there are better places in Oakland for that.  Calzones are based on the same great crust so they're pretty solid.  Good, quick, and friendly service for the most part. My major qualm is that it closes pretty early and that it isn't open on weekends.  Overall, easily the best spot in Oakland to grab a plain or spinach slice. Forget the competition, Milano's is king."}
{"text":"I need to update my review because these guys are that awesome! I ordered a pizza online to be delivered, with instructions to call my cell phone because my building doesn't have an intercom. Time goes by, and I don't sweat it because the last time I ordered the poor delivery guy got stuck in traffic caused by the Pitt basketball game and I live close by to that. Little did I know that my pizza was just feet outside, but my PHONE DIED! I had no idea the delivery guy was trying to call me and that he waited out there patiently for more than half an hour! I felt so bad...and when I finally realized he was here, he was so kind and understanding...and so was the guy I talked to at the pizza place over the phone when I called to apologize. These guys are top notch, and good service like this makes me stay as a customer. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Jus got done with one of THEE BEST steak hogies I have had east of the Mississippi in a VERY LONG time. Totally fricken SKIRUMPTOUS !! And the Plain Breaded wings were fried to perfection !!! Great Job Patrick !!! Peace - Taz from TN"}
{"text":"They do pizza by the slice here! I've tried their pepperoni pizza, white pizza and cheese pizza and it's all good pizza for a good price. The location is a small restaurant with enough seating for a good number of people, but I usually have it delivered. If you're just looking for good pizza, then try this place."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe this place only had a 3 star average. I go here once a week, and I really think this is among the best pizza places in Pittsburgh. And others clearly feel the same since there's usually a line around the corner on weekdays between 12 and 1! This place is a gem, and the people who work there are as nice as they come."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for some personal reasons, and we were starving and had been eating some pretty bad food and was craving pizza. Being from New York we wasn't expecting much but this place was amazing. Tasted like New York pizza and Michael and Juan were super inviting and make a killer pie. The calzones look legit too! We will def be back during our stay for sure!"}
{"text":"Dont get all the good reviews. Must be drunk college kids. The cheese on the pizza was super greesy and kept sliding off, and the hoagies were soggy. My girlfriend said she would give it 0 stars if she could. Had a Groupon and still wasnt worth it"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, the best in Oakland area. Not sure why other people rated it low, but its delicious. Try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 6:32 PM on a Tuesday night. I understand that traffic in Pittsburgh can suck, but it is 8:25pm. My driver literally just pulled up. 2 HOURS for cold pizza. At least he was nice and appologetic. I can't comment on the taste because it is in the oven now, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Disappointing.... sauce tasted terrible,  almost too salty. Will not return... there are farrrrr better pizza makers in this city!!"}
{"text":"I've been getting pizza from here for many, many years.  My office at Pitt has been a long supporter of Milano's by purchasing 100s of pizzas for student events for some time.    I went in with two colleagues on this occasion and a GroupOn towards our order.  We had the Hawaiian Pizza, pepperoni roll, an order of bread sticks, and drinks all for $27 ($2 cash with the $25 GroupOn).  It was very busy with many folks buying slices for take out but we got our large order in less than 15 minutes.  The pizza was absolutely delicious.  Actually, everything was delicious.    Milano's is a fantastic college campus pizza place that is frequented also by the many people who work in Oakland.  There is not a lot of seating but there is a spot in the back that would likely fit a group of 10.  So come in to eat or grab takeout, this is a solid pizza place."}
{"text":"Think of average pizza.  Now add a little more cheese and a lot more grease.  Welcome to Milanos.  (Admittedly, the tastes are pretty good, but unless you're in college, prepare for a post-meal stomach ache.  If you ARE in college, maybe knock this rating up to 4 stars.)"}
{"text":"OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR A PIZZA AND SALAD TO BE DELIVERED ON A MONDAY NIGHT and then to have the delivery guy never show up. Requested a refund and thankfully the EatStreet app has amazing customer service, unlike these bums.  Ordered at 640, finally decided enough was enough and cancelled at 820. I love supporting local businesses versus chains but for the love of God pizza hut has a 30 minute order to door wait time right now!   no pens games, no apologies, just \"he's on his way\".     It's my own fault for being lazy and ordering pizza and expecting a restaurant to provide decent food within the provided timeframe. I mean, the delivery guy did have to drive all the way to children's hospital from the hill district. That's a tough one and a half mile stretch of road.    Never again."}
{"text":"They have great Pizza, hoagies and meals. They have excellent service and great staff. The owner is always there and gets to know the regulars. They are also competitively priced and have less of specials."}
{"text":"Have stopped by a couple of times for a couple of slices.  The place is usually busy especially around the lunch hour.  The people are friendly, especially the poor cook that has so many pies in the oven.  Noticed his shirt had two Milano's locations, one in Allison Park so I guess there is at least one other location. The sign on front says Milano's pizzeria.   Have always been happy with my slices of pizza.  A medium crust with a decent sauce."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Oakland, and my favorite pizza in the entire city for that matter.  Milano's sells really delicious New York-style pizza, by the slice or by the whole pie.  The sauce and the cheese are both really good, and the crust is usually pretty tasty too.  My favorite pizza here is probably the primavera, but all the different pizzas are good.  I am originally from upstate New York, in a city with a pretty large Italian population.  This pizza is what I eat when I miss my local pizza place from home.  I'm only giving Milano's four stars because of its frequent crowdedness, which makes it difficult to go there and come back in the hour allotted to me for lunch, and because they only have Pepsi and not Coke.  Pepsi is an inferior beverage.  (Actually, I decided to relent and give it five stars anyway.)"}
{"text":"I think Milano's is  one  the best in Pittsburgh and the staff is friendly and funny . Great quality slices and hoagies are fanastic ."}
{"text":"the worst servece.  i will never go back to this place. rude and arrogant. no word for appology."}
{"text":"Racist racist racist. I came on a Wednesday for pizza for the first time and the cook decided that it was okay to to start spewing racial slurs and making references thinking I wouldn't hear him. Gross."}
