{"text":"Was visiting Laval on business for one day, had the hardest time finding a place to eat. Typed in Laval in my GPS hoping to find the centre of downtown and ended up getting lost. Did google search of steak and Gualdieri's popped up. Great food and staff were super attentive, big shout out to Luigi who took care of us and made some wonderful recommendations. It's too bad we're leaving, would have wanted to try the scampi."}
{"text":"Leno and his staff will absolutely have you coming back for more.  I visited this restaurant while on a business trip to Laval.  I ended up coming back again several times and wished my business trip was longer just so I could try the pizza and other fine pasta dishes + desserts.  This is the first time ever that I ever wished my trip was longer.    Just when you think your taste buds were fully satiated, dessert makes you rethink your place in this world.  I fully recommend this place and only gave it 5 stars because there wasn't a higher selection.    Authentic Italian food that rivals any dishes I had on my last trip to Italy, personable service that is second to none, old world treatment and you can't help but want to come back.    Great job Leno--I look forward to my quarterly visits to Montreal."}
{"text":"Nous avons commander une pizza internationale et des polpettes sauce napolitaine, excellent, meilleure pizza, la pâte croustillante, les ingrédients abondants et frais, les viandes, pepperoni, capicolle et bacon d'une excellente qualité, les garnitures et le fromage abondant. La sauce sublime. Et le tout livré dans les 30 minutes, même si il y avait tempête de neige. J'ai hâte d'aller déguster leur menu et cave à vin d'importation privée sur place"}
{"text":"Merveilleux endroit !!! J ai pris le veau parmigiana, la ptite a pris les cannellonis et tout était excellent :) Le service de Christopher était excellent ! Un endroit a recommander et ou on retournera certainement !"}
{"text":"The quest for pizza continues in Laval. Today's stop was Gualdieri. We ordered a large all dressed with bacon. It was delivered quite quickly by a friendly driver.   The pizza itself was horrible. It was a soggy mess, and looked like it could of used 10 more minutes in the oven. So that's what we did! We put it back in our oven for about 10 minutes and it came out decent. I have, by far, eaten much better pizza at a 2 for 1 joint then this pizza.   Reading the reviews I was quite surprised with what we got. For now, they are on our 'do not call' list. I vote with you wallet folks and it's staying put for this place. Oh well stuff happens!"}
{"text":"This resto is a local gem that truly needs to be shared to others who don't know of its existence.  Gualdieri's is the place to go to eat authentic, well-made Italian cuisine. As someone's who has half-Italian origins in his blood and probably ate for the first 20 something years of his life at least 5 Italian meals a week and simply refuses to go eat at most \"Italian\" restos in and around the Montreal region all his life.... this should speak wonders on how exceptional this little gem is.   My favorite resto will always be \"Casa Di Mama\" (Mom's House - a pun) but Gualdieri is a solid second. I would have said close second but my mom might read this one day....  I've been a patron of this place on occasion and they have been very good to me, particularly for my wife's secret 30th birthday a few years back. They have always been friendly and accommodating and truly holds a special place in my heart.  So, let's talk about the resto in detail shall shall we?  The resto is moderate sized, walls and decorations are warm with a certain measure of class that feels just right. During the summer, they have a small terrace one can enjoy. In particular, their winery is nice to look at.  On their appetizer menu I've had their calamari and bocconcini & pomodoro. The calamari was very good with the right amount of chewy/crunchy ratio. The bocconcini cheese was fresh and tasty and the tomatoes were just right and complimented the cheese nicely. Both meal sizes are somewhat average and can possibly feed 2 people.  On their main menu, I've had their \"Gnocchi alla Cardinale\", Bruschetta as well as their Canadese Pizza. The Gnocchi comes drenched in a succulent rosée sauce that was really good.  The Canadese pizza is a thin crust pizza with select toppings that was very solid though I've had far better pizzas at Bottega. The Bruchetta however is out of this world and probably the best I've eaten on this side of the ocean. Even describing it now makes my mouse salivate. Tomatoes, basil, garlic, parmesan... quite the legendary treat one must not try at least once in their life.  All their deserts are made in-house and they vary from night to night. Which is intriguing for those willing to try something new every time they visit but can be somewhat disappointing when select things you crave aren't available that night.  Their lava cakes are also out of this world. Warmed just right, these chocolate treats go a long way and end your night just right. I've also had their Flan and it was exceptional as well. The Zeppole was about average however.  Their cappuccino is well pressed and never misses to taste just as it should.  The service is friendly and caring. On all visits they have taken care of us admirably and deserve nice tips. Probably the best service I can possibly get.   The price tag can get expensive as some things do end up but nothing that isn't out of balance of the value you're getting.  They are great for parties, kids/infants (plenty of seats) but also a place I recommend as a quiet \"date night\". Romance can be achieved here with ease with the right setting in mind. Always communicate your needs ahead of time and they will always take care of you.  A true 5 star place."}
