{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Definitely nice to have a place like this in Brampton--let's face it, there aren't that many food choices in Brampton. 

They have $4 bar rail drinks on Saturday, perfect for a ladies night. My friend and I shared a few items. We had mussels, fish and chips and bacon-wrapped shrimp. Everything was good; no complaints."}
{"text":"A hidden gem, my friend recommended this place and its only a few minutes from where I live.  Sooo glad I took her advice, the food is prepared to order. I ordered the fish and chips and its was authentic pub fish and chips (no frozen fish filet here), my husband had the shepards pie and once again it was made fresh.  Will definitely be back to try more on the menu"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. All different age groups from the young crowd to old. Drinks were good they give the beers in the right glasses. Food was on the low end. In fact we ordered our appetizers and the waiter brought them out with our dinner (they maybe forgot or something) so that was messed up. The food taste didn't even taste good compared to other pubs. 

Cool thing was they had karokeee night on Friday and it was actually fun. The scene of the place is nice and upscale. Everyone seemed chill and lots of people went up to sing. 

The washrooms are cool too because they have fricken TVs where the uranyl is...I was like wow this is cool.

The staff moved some guy around (karaoke fan) to seat us which was appreciated. So far this is one of my fav pubs but it really sucked the food was not good ."}
{"text":"This establishment is walking distance from my friends house and we popped in here to celebrate her birthday. 

It was a nice sunny evening and we were sat on the patio, and served immediately, it wasn't a busy evening which was nice. 

I was craving a chicken pot pie, which is exactly what i had for dinner, and it was delicious. 

We had the lobster appetizer as well, although i wasn't a fan of it, as it wasn't real lobster.

i thought it was super sweet that they brought out a little treat for my girl's birthday. 

A great local establishment!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is superb. This would be the perfect spot to bring your friends to watch your favourite sport while consuming a few beverages and chowing on some good pub food at a very reasonable price. The staff was very friendly coming over to make a bit of small talk when time allowed. A little slip up with an order led to multiple apologies throughout our visit."}
{"text":"If anyone has been on my Instagram, they know this is my go-to pub in Brampton. This place is light years ahead of the previous businesses to hold this unit in service, atmosphere and food. What I enjoy most is their weekend breakfast menu. The menu caters to all patrons as it has your simple breakfast classic, authentic options from both Ireland and Scotland, and more refined brunch options. It is also very kid friendly. 

I have visited for dinner or lunch a few times and each time I walked away very happy. I really have high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Keenan's is a great little local pub with lots of TVs all around the place, great service by friendly staff, really good food, and spectacular live entertainment."}
{"text":"Decent bar. Great place to go to with friends. The entertainment is great. Love how they have Brampton's own bands come. Also the food is great and love the drinks and shots. The reason why I give this a 2 is because the service sucks. He last time I was there I spent an hour waiting on a drink. I've had to order two at a time just because it will be an hour. You can never get the staffs attention barely. Maybe is they hire more staff on busy nights it would be better."}
{"text":"I have seen many pubs in this location over the years but this time it was done right. Clean, trendy and a nice atmosphere. The food is good and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Your typical bar. Decent for Brampton. 

I've been a couple of times and it is always packed! I l even came across a couple nights of karaoke, lots of fun! 

The staff are friendly, it does take some time for them to make it to our table. I think the last time we were there, the bouncer took our drink orders. Lol!"}
{"text":"Love this place- nice and clean, they just did some renovations. Great service. Delicious food! Super fresh- great pub food. Wings are great- my fav are the hot. Anddd then I ordered the poutine which was also awesome. 2 thumbs up"}
