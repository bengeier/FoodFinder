{"text":"Ce petit restaurant est un incontournable de la rue Prince-Arthur. Ils offrent salades, pizzas, brochettes cuites sur charbon de bois, poutine et sandwichs. Un prix imbattable! Je mange toujours super bien pour à peine $10 (2 brochettes avec 2 salades).Pour les amateurs, ils offrent des brochettes de filet mignon et laissez-moi vous dire que c'est succulent. Et que dire du service que j'ai. Ils sont tellement accueillant et toujours super serviable. Maintenant que je suis un habitué, il prépare son charbon d'avance pour mes brochettes, pour être certain que je n'ai pas à attendre trop longtemps. Que demander de plus? Vous pouvez également vous réchauffer avec un bon café ou thé lors la température est fraiche. Aller y faire un tour et n'ayez pas peur de parler avec le personnel, ils sont si chaleureux.   This small restaurant is a must of the Prince Arthur Street. They offer salads, pizzas, skewers cooked on charcoal, poutine and sandwiches. Unbeatable price! I always eat great for just $ 10 (2 skewers with 2 salads) .For lovers, they offer filet mignon skewers and let me tell you it is delicious. And what about the service I have. They are so welcoming and always super helpful. Now that I'm a regular customer, he prepares the charcoal in advance for my skewers, to be sure I don't have to wait too long. I can't ask for more! You can also warm up yourself with a cup of coffee or tea when the temperature is cool. Go check it out and do not be afraid to talk with the staff, they are so friendly."}

{"text":"Wife and I were looking for some awesome poutine while we were in Montreal and we found this place.   Here are 5 reasons why we are definitely going back.   1. All meat is halal. (Heaven for halal eaters) 2. Poutine was SOOOO GOOD.  3. As much as we wanted to go back same day we couldn't.  4. Location is good. Not too far from main central downtown Montreal.  5. Everything on the menu looks amazing and we want to go back and try all of them."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great.  We had a montrealais and a lebanais sandwich and booth we delicious. The fries also deserve a good mention, they are just like the old Harvey fries before Harvey's changed them.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Has Sunday hours posted on door but are not open Sunday. No additional signage explaining why they might be closed."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place when they had 99 cent pizza,  not because it was cheap but because it was good and the owners were really nice.  While now they have changed their concept completely and it is over the top good.  They now offer these great sandwiches,  burgers and poutines, but this is not just another greasy spoon I personally have only had their sandwiches,  one Lebanese,  one Montreal both were delicious and huge.   They are big and tasty so it is more than I can eat in one sitting,  but I saw some students there eating there trio.  Tye price is very reasonable and the new facelift inside is really neat and cute.  Try them out you will enjoy."}
