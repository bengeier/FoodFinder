{"text":"Have enjoyed Gus' for a decade.  Last time I went a few days ago, it was the pits.  Server never brought me my coffee, though I asked three times, until the food arrived, fifteen minutes after I'd ordered the coffee.  She seemed out of it to me; \"no problem\" was her favorite expression but everything was a problem for her while serving me.  The food, which had always been very good, was awful--greasy and slimy.  I may try it one more time (though I'll be certain not to set where that particular waitress is assigned).  If the experience repeats, I won't be back.  Don't know what has caused the change (maybe it was a one-day thing) but it's gone way downhill."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service and really good food! I love going to this place for breakfast (served all day), lunch or dinner. Delicious pies, sundaes and shakes, too!"}
{"text":"I've ate here multiple times and the food to me is gross. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it's not very good. It's not expensive but not very good food. The atmosphere is neat it has cool old time decorations! The waitstaff has always been very nice too. I will not go back here though because I do not like the food."}
{"text":"Gus's is a fifties-themed diner, so ambience is what it is--get over it.  I've been here for breakfast a few times, and I'm happy to report that the fare is just fine.  The service is friendly and attentive. I can't remember the last time (if there ever was one) that I was blown away by breakfast food, so what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. You always get your money's worth. The ambience is a little much for my taste but hey it's a diner so it's expected."}
{"text":"Ihop, Denny's, and whatever else breakfast is around here ain't got nothin on Gus's diner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, correction to my previous review. I did go back there but they did not have the creamy rice soup I liked. The BBQ rips was not great. My hubby's BBQ is way better. My husband had a chili soup and he didn't like it either. Like the previous reviewer said this is the kind of place to you go for experience, not for the food. After a long water play, my kids usually eat anything but the didn't even finish half their order and came home still hungry. It was a disappointment but  I would go back there for their rice soup if they ever make it again"}
{"text":"It was our first time to Gus's Diner and we would visit again soon.  I was pleasantly surprised that everything we ordered (I had the Vegetarian Omelette and my friend had Southwest Skillet) wasn't greasy. The serving size was perfect, the price was reasonable, and the service was great- attentive, accurate, and well-knowledgeable.  The food came out in a very timely manner, considering that the place was relatively busy."}
{"text":"Love Gus's! The food, the service and staff always make us come back. A hometown favorite!"}
{"text":"Have driven by it for years to and from Sun Prairie and always meant to stop in.  Took the family there today for Father's Day.  The restaurant has an attractive retro decor, and the place was immaculately clean. Staff was all helpful, pleasant and prompt. The food was excellent - I tried a burger that had a fried egg, barbecue sauce, cheese, etc. that was delicious.  Oldest son had the Elvis pancakes (peanut butter, banana, chocolate chips on the pancakes) and liked them very much. Youngest son had mac and cheese, which had generous shavings of cheddar on top  Middle boy had the ribs, tender and nicely done. The chicken dumpling soup was also good.  Word of warning, come hungry--the portion sizes were enormous!  The chocolate shake my son ordered to go was a work of art."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  It's never really been amazing.  This evening, we were seated in the way back room which has the worst ambiance.  I got to sit at a table and I faced a grey wall with tacky new pictures that are trying to look old.  I didn't even have a window to look out of.  I'd rather sit in my car in the parking lot and eat.    I got the unlimited fish/shrimp fry with a baked potato.  My potato wasn't warm enough to melt my butter.  It didn't taste like a baking potato.  The breading on fish was wet like it had been sitting around for a while.  Btw it was 7:15 on a Friday.  A busy time.  Why wasn't it made to order??  We were asked if we wanted more fish or shrimp AFTER our plates were bused.    We rarely saw our waitress, she spent her time in the front part of the restaurant which I honestly don't blame her for doing.    We won't be going back to Gus's restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute little diner with a 50s vibe and super friendly staff! Gus even came by to say hi to our toddler. The food was reasonably priced and my kid loved the French toast especially. Would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"This place serves yuuuuge portions! I'm going to buy this place and make Sun Prairie great again. Then I'm gonna build a wall to keep the people from Madison out and I'm gonna make Madison pay for it. - DT"}
{"text":"This place was really cute! The atmosphere is adorable and kitschy as all diners should be, and unlike the other reviewers I found the food to be quite good! The delivery was prompt and the food was tasty and classic. Monty's Blue Plate will give you a more gourmet approach to diner food but a place like Gus's has everything you expect in the way you expect it. I'm undoubtedly a city girl, but I appreciated their charm and tasty food. I'll probably come back when I'm looking for that genuine diner feel that's harder to find in a metropolitan area."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was wonderful, large potions,. I ordered the covered chop sirloin and mashed potatoes Lots of cheese fresh mushrooms and veggies the potatoes were not instant and the gravy was tasty, I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is the kind of diner I remember from the 1960's.  Food is plentiful and  wonderfully delicious!!!  The service was fantastic lots of back home personality!  I will be here often!!"}
{"text":"Nice service with good people working. The food is very filling and delicious. I have never ordered anything bad but I definitely prefer the burgers over the club sandwich. I just really hope they stop using styrofoam to-go containers as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Typical diner food items. The scrambles are great! One of the few diners around where you actually get more than you pay for. Service was very, very good!"}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times & have had great food every time. Excellent service & Great prices. We love this place & try to stop anytime we're in the area."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to check this place out because every time we passed it the parking lot was full. The night we stopped by was no exception, it was a packed house. It's a cool 1950's-themed greasy spoon complete with jukebox. I went for the special, the Friday Night Fish Fry, but it was pretty lackluster and I wouldn't order it again. The milkshake was pretty good. It seems like the kind of place you go for the experience and not so much the actual food. For my money, I'd rather go to Monty's Blue Plate in Madison. It's very similar, but the food is better."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and wonderful service!  The wait staff is friendly and efficient. We love this place especially for breakfast. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered the classic cheeseburger, French fries, a strawberry shake, and my meal came with a cup of chicken wildrice soup.  Everything tasted really good. It was a sunday afternoon so I was the only person in the restaurant.  Staff was friendly. I am craving those strawberry shakes now! :)"}
{"text":"So, we are still here to pay our bill but the story is, my friend had a dead fly IN her corn. IN the corn! They discounted her meal a whopping 50%. So we got maybe $3 off. When I pointed out that this was a little ridiculous for a DEAD FLY in her meal, the response was, \"well, it was only the corn,\" as if the fact that she had eaten the rest (before she discovered the DEAD FLY in her corn) made it any better. If she had discovered Musca Domestica Linnaeus at the start of the meal, she wouldn't have eaten any of it.   A dead fly, people. A dead fly.   I wish I had thought to take a photo."}
{"text":"This place was great!  There were six of us and we all enjoyed what we ordered.  The best part was the service!  Our waitress Rebecca was so good and very nice.  We were celebrating two birthdays so each celebrant got to select a dessert from the dessert carousel.  Everything was homemade.  The butterschotch pie and chocolate cake were delicious!    The nice thing too is they offer a Kids Eat Free special on Mondays for children under 10.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food, crowded, hurried service  (the bus boy would swoop in and grab stuff as he said \"you done\")"}
{"text":"Maybe I should give five stars, these guys are pretty good!  I have brought clients there a number of times and have been satisfied with the food and service.  I can't say anything bad about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Passing through from Chicago and found this place on yelp. Amazing service, food came out quickly, fresh and delicious! We ordered the vegetarian scrambler and the chicken fajita skillet. Both had fresh veggies and the chicken in the skillet was grilled to perfection. Pancakes were noteworthy - perfectly sweet and fluffy. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great but not bad.  Atmosphere is fun and the service is decent.  Very large portions so you get your money's worth.  We go past it a lot, so I'd be open to going back."}
{"text":"Moved to DeForest a year ago and my boyfriend and I finally found our breakfast spot! Love this place."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast, big menu, something for everyone. Always very busy. This is your typical, bottomless-coffee-cup diner. If you need something greasy to soak up the remains of your Saturday night, this is your place."}
{"text":"Good as advertised American fare.  Service was prompt.  Prices were surprisingly inexpensive. Atmosphere 50s diner.  Couple of quirks: jukeboxes at the table should be free and working.  If it's not working than get rid of it, takes up unnecessary space. Free wi-fi sign on door.  There is no free wi-fi, that's irritating."}
{"text":"The salad was good , the hamburger was caked in bleu cheese to an inedible fault.  It's a no for me..... a big no. :("}
{"text":"I went to Dave's Auto Service on Pflaum Road, Madison , Wi. Service advisor informed me to go online and register on Yelp.Com. To get a 20 percent discount on my service. GREAT advice saved 24 dollars on change transmission fluid. Each time that is applied great info. Free Wi fi , beverage and TV."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. And I'm usually required to take my dad here every time he is in town so he can relive his younger days.   If you're looking for a familiar, comfortable throwback to the good ol' American 50s-60s diner days, the space and the food won't let you down!"}
{"text":"I often travel through Sun Prairie on my way to Richland Center for work.  I stop at Gus's whenever possible.  I have had food from the breakfast and lunch menu.  The pancakes have a slight vanilla flavor and are one of my favorite sides.  One of my favorite breakfast (or lunch) items is one of their skillets.  They have several different flavors to match your fancy and I have never had one that was a disappointment.  The BLT and club sandwiches are also good.  This place is a diner and is just like what you would expect.  The service is fast and with a smile.  Your coffee or soda will never go empty."}
{"text":"Easy atmosphere, relaxing. Food was exactly what I wanted. Home cooked taste. Lots of side dishes. Wait staff was good."}
{"text":"Note..I've been here many more times.  The chocolate shake is great.  The ribs are awesome...fall off the bone St Loius style.  Still staying away from apple pie though ;)"}
{"text":"This place is really cool looking, inside and out!  Retro 50s type diner with pretty darn good burgers."}
{"text":"Great food!  My wife had a burger that was cooked to perfection, I had a Greek omelet that was fabulous ... American fries to die for!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because of the reviews, seeing a busy parking lot when we drive by, and just because it looks like a pretty cool diner. I wasn't too impressed with my meal here, but the service was quick and good.   I ordered the turkey club sandwich, which is usually my go-to at diners so I can compare. The flavor was okay, the bread itself was kind of stale. The fries were plopped right on top of it, so presentation wise it was pretty lame. The fries also were kind of floppy and soggy. My chicken soup on the side probably tasted the best out of the whole meal.   It was a disappointing experience, but we'll likely try again and see if there's a difference."}
{"text":"Funky atmosphere.   Pleasant service.  Classic breakfast items on the menu.   Prices are on higher side for diner food (on a dish by dish comparison), but the food quality and portions make the prices seem fair.   Not a place I would go out of my way to try but definitely a place to hit up if in area and looking for diner food."}
{"text":"What fun!! 50's style diner complete with pie display, soooo many pies! Car memoribilia, burgers, pie?! Portions are generous & tasty and the staff is very friendly. We've had breakfast & dinner, great meals each time. We like it & our 4yo grandson thinks it's a big treat to come here. Not many places you can take all family members that ALL of them like."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, cool atmosphere 50/60,s very pleasant and cheerful waitstaff.  They had a prime rib sandwich special.gave it a try, expecting sliced beef on a bun..to my surprise I got an inch thick piece of prime bigger than the bun,fries ,and a bowl of soup. Could not eat it all & was it good. I'll do this again! !"}
{"text":"I held my rehearsal dinner at Gus's Diner when I got married. It was well worth it for the amazing food and fantastic service. I've enjoyed everything I've eaten here especially the French fries. I would highly suggest that people try the burgers which are favorable and filling or the breakfast skillets (my favorite is the Southwest Skillet)."}
{"text":"Gus's is the kind of place you go to for the experience rather than the food, and certainly not for the location if you live in downtown Madison like I do!  Gus's is a perfectly adequate greasy-spoon diner that's well outside of Sun Prairie's \"downtown.\"  The decor is reminiscent of a classic '50s diner (or at least, it does a passable imitation for those of us too young to remember the actual '50s), replete with jukeboxes at every table and a red-white-and-chrome color scheme.  The waitstaff are decently friendly and competent.  The menu, which includes a fun \"In the '50s...\" list of ZOMG EVERYTHING WAS SO CHEAP shockers, is huge and very unhealthy.  I greatly dislike the processed taste of the creamy soups, but the sandwiches, omelets and burgers are all tasty and beyond filling.  Avoid the chicken tenders -- a friend ate them once and they were inedibly salty.  The same friend pronounced the coleslaw \"meh\" (I assure you, he's a connoisseur -- I myself don't touch the stuff).  No one I've ever been there with has ever sampled the desserts.  If you choose to assuage your nagging conscience with the salad bar, you'll probably be a lot more disappointed than if you'd just gone for the Denver omelet... mmm.  Overall, it's the kind of food that hits the spot when you wake up late on a weekend day and realize you are starving.  I'd probably have given it 4 stars, but the coffee kinda sucks."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Reminds me of the dinners I went to all the time back in Philly.  Food is good, prices are reasonable and always a good crowd. Sadly a sign says there is WiFi, but I have yet to connect to it."}
{"text":"Gus's Diner is a reliable classic-style Sun Prairie diner. In the company of Prairie Diner and Market Street Diner, each restaurant has its strengths and weaknesses. Gus's strengths include:   - creative yet comfortable traditional American specials: bbq beef ribs,  pot roast over noodles, etc.  - pies that look perfectly dreamy - standard diner menu fare: corned beef hash, breakfast skillets and scramblers, burgers, etc.  - fast yet attentive service -- the waitstaff is incredibly efficient but not rushed.   The food preparation is not consistently perfect, but is generally good and what you would expect from an average diner.   The campy retro decor is a little passe,  but also fun. The restaurant is more catered to families, so not the destination for a bloody brunch (I don't think alcohol is on the brunch menu at all, fyi). They are packed weekend mornings - a sign of a good restaurant  -- but always have plenty of seating available.   I think Gus's is a good Sun Prairie diner option, and I would definitely go back to try the pies and lunch specials. It's the place to go if you want traditional American diner food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad sammy with creamy cauliflower soup. Really good!!"}
{"text":"Had a very good meal here.  A burger/ruben sandwich combined.  Service is friendly, portions big.  Will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Finally went for lunch yesterday and what a great place!  Diner food with a diner feel!  Ricky was our server and was very friendly and efficient.  Will be going back soon enough!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was fast and effective. The food tasted good. I ordered a belgian waffle with bacon and hash browns and my husband ordered some country friend steak with poached eggs and loaded hash browns. The restaurant is decorated really cute. The prices aren't bad. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"1.)  The table side juke boxes don't work right  2.)  The food is what every person who wants a heart attack eats on a regular basis  3.)  No way you're picking up any hot guys under 80 here (I settled for Bob who lives on a stool at the counter.  Go Viagra!)"}
{"text":"We've stopped in on our way out of town a couple of times.  The food is pretty crappy, but I'll take it over McDonald's any day!  You have personal juke boxes in your booth, which is pretty cute but we've never gotten it to work correctly :(    It's diner food; the meatloaf sandwich was pretty good, and the burgers not bad.  The fries were not very good but the milkshake was wonderful!  If you're in the area stop in."}
{"text":"I LOVED Gus's! It was great that you can get half or small orders of things, I got the half eggs Benedict and it was delish. The egg was cooked perfectly, the sauce was rich and creamy overall was really yummy. Instead of hash browns I asked for corned beef hash and you can def tell it is homemade, so crispy! My BF got the meat lovers skillet, good quality meats and nicely cooked eggs. The coffee was good, not weak like most diners and service was on point. The best thing about this place though is the atmosphere, absolutely love it."}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews.. i really do, but man oh man, Gus's Diner is not something that lends itself to positive reviews.  Food- gross, unhealthy Cleanliness- dirty Service- 2 thumbs down Ambiance- almost everyone in this place is pushing 350lbs... and shoveling food down their throats, as to keep that standard going. it's not a comfortable place to eat  I have nothing nice to say.."}
{"text":"Great 50's style diner.  My wife and I go here at least twice a week.  We really like the salad bar and their breakfasts are awesome. My 2 favorite things to get are the corned beef hash skillet and the country fried steak and eggs.  The best thing I found here is that you get a lot of food for the money. I don't know many places where you can walk out stuffed to the gills (2 people) for under 20 bucks."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Love the atmosphere here. The food was delicious! Super crispy hash browns and the pancakes may be the BEST I've ever had!!! Fast and friendly service too. My new favorite breakfast place :)"}
{"text":"A breakdown of my experience of Gus's Diner:  + Cute, shiny exterior with lots of glittery, chrome goodness inside to match... - ... but overall some extra stuff piled up in weird places and looked a little worn, especially on the counter side + Super friendly staff + Great music appropriate to the theme + In-booth mini jukeboxes... - ...that don't work. The coin slots are all taped over. Boooooooo.  + Inexpensive + Root beer malts, a thing I haven't seen since going to Pinocchio's in Racine as a kid + The option of an old-school turkey dinner served on white bread and covered in turkey gravy... - ...where the turkey ended up being a slab of equally old-school processed turkey loaf instead of carved turkey breast - My meal came with soup - I went for the BLT soup out of curiosity and it was a cheesy base with halved cherry tomatoes and what appeared to be pieces of cabbage? It was actually surprisingly tasty, cabbage/lettuce/mystery leaves and all.   Overall the food seemed to fall a little more to the processed/Sysco side of the spectrum. I don't think I'll probably need to eat here again, but I might make my way back to give them root beer malt a try because I am having some serious nostalgia for one. It's hard to go wrong listening to oldies and sipping on a malt."}
{"text":"Great! I got the Blue Cheese Scramble with a side of pancakes & the boyfriend got the Southwest Skillet. Great food, excellent service, fast. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We tried the Ruben and the French dip. The Ruben was OK nothing special. The so \"special\" chili was also OK. Besides good service all was OK. The place looks pretty nice and the decoration is old school too."}
{"text":"Went in for a late brunch one Saturday. Overall, a pretty good diner experience. The retroness of the decor added to the experience in my opinion. But I still get entertained by standing in front of a jukebox flipping through the song list. The food was good, not great. My steak and eggs weren't great. At least the steak wasn't. A little overcooked and seemed like a slightly lesser piece of meat than the steak and eggs at some other cafes and diners, but I'm not too picky about my steak unless it gets charred, which they didn't do. The highlight for me though was the pleasant cheerfulness of my waitress. She even called me \"Hun\" (as in honey, not Attila), and being called hun by a waitress in a diner setting just made my day. Definitely a good place for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The food is nice for a diner. I've never had to wait. I usually have the chicken sandwich.I've only ever been here for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there once together just for soup and salad bar. We've been craving it ever since, so a few weeks now. The best part.. its only like six bucks for soup and the salad bar. The soup tastes homemade and the salad bar is... oh... so good! I hope this place never leaves."}
{"text":"This is pretty much standard diner fare  for the food - good portions for your buck. Don't miss the pancakes for breakfast - they beat the pants off Perkins for sure. Get over the JUKEBOXES - there's too much noise in this joint to hear each and every one anyways.  Burgers and desserts are great as well. Its pretty apparent much of everything else is out of a container or box. Not much of anything is from scratch that I can tell."}
{"text":"We had 3 people in our party and our bill with tip came to $45.  The food was just mediocre.  It wasn't any better than i could get at a Dennys or similar.  I should not have to pay for out dated memorabilia all over the restaurant.   I had 2 pancakes and 21 eggs and my bill alone was well over $10.  One party had the Corn Beef Hash and the whole Hash was so dried out she could not eat it.  It was a one stop shop for me."}
{"text":"I met a fellow co-worker here for lunch.  I have not been in this neighborhood in about 7 years, so I was surprised how much has sprung up around it.  This definitely has a 50's feel of an old diner (with the James Dean and Marilyn Monroe prints as well as a the round, red vinyl barstools).  It is a wide restaurant, but not very deep.  On the left side as you enter is a pretty basic salad bar.  For lunch, my friend and I both had salads.  I opted for the taco salad and she had a chicken type salad.  I, for one, would much prefer romaine or leaf to iceberg lettuce, but I was not afforded that option.  The meat was good and the taco bowl was crunchy and light; a good start.  Instead of sour cream, they provided two pre-packaged sour creams (which kind of ruins the feel for me) and the salsa was definitely from some jar/can.  Not bad, but certainly not great either.    The meal was definitely inexpensive, but the service was average and the value would be as well.  If you have other lunch options, I would look at them first."}
{"text":"Was out and about with my wife and daughter when we came across this gem. When we arrived, the place was packed. Luckily the huge wrap around benches in the entryway were nice and cushy. Though we didn't need to wait long. The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect. Shiny chrome everywhere with jukeboxes at every booth, which were also quite spacious. Waiter didn't rush us and was very nice. Gus even came and said hi to every table. The menu was large with a lot to choose from. The portions were as impressive as the quality, and the prices are hard to beat. The pies looked incredible and tasted even better. I did not have a chance to try the salad bar, but from what I saw on others plates the lettuce looked fresh and the toppings to go with.  I am looking forward to visiting here again and sampling their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Gus's a couple of times now, once for breakfast and once for a night time dessert.  I'm a big fan of the atmosphere.  The quality of the breakfast items was very good and daytime staff was incredible.  Though, Gus's seems to miss that \"thing\" that makes them special.  I found myself wishing that they had more options, in particular, an \"everything\" type omelet/skillet.    For our dessert trip, it was, pun intended, like night to day.  Despite being fairly slow, the staff was almost lethargic.  The pies looked and tasted like the same that you would get from one of the chains.  My shake was alright, but there wasn't a lot to it.  In case my excitement isn't showing through enough, I'm am barely above 'Meh', but until I can find a great breakfast place in the area, I'll probably be returning here."}
{"text":"We gathered for a family thing - the back room is a nice way to do that.  Ricky, the waiter, was very personable - he was fantastic.  The food was okay.  The appetizers were very good - cheese curds and onion rings.  Tasty.  For dinner, I got the pot roast over noodles.  It sounded like a nice comfort food dish.  When served, it wasn't quite the \"Ma's home cooking\" I thought it would be, but it was alright.  Not quite enough roast, but it tasted fine.  The soups there were pretty decent - nice to get a bowl with each meal.  I tried someone's cole slaw and it too was pretty good.  Overall, the food is what you would expect at a typical diner.  Not the best, but not the worst.  The burgers looked pretty good - I'd probably try one of those next time.  The french dip looked a little dry, which made me think I would have regretted getting the philly, which was my second choice.  The menu has a little bit of everything, so everyone in your party should find something to order.  The ambiance was classic diner.  If you've seen this place from the outside, you should NOT be surprised by the 60's style diner interior.  If you're not up for that, then just stay away.  Would I go back?  Yeah, sure - if something was planned there.  Sun Prairie isn't exactly next door, so something besides the food would have to draw me there.   Reading other reviews, I WOULD go back to try their breakfasts."}
{"text":"Gus's has quickly become our go-to breakfast place in Sun Prairie! The service is friendly and usually pretty quick.  It's a 50's style greasy diner, but there are some decent breakfast options if you want to stick to healthier choices. Their omelettes and scramblers are great - the greek omelette is our favorite! If you don't want the extra calories, they are very nice about customizing the order to your preferences.  Order off their breakfast menu - their lunch/dinner options haven't impressed us."}
{"text":"A 50's diner with plenty of nostalgia (including 60's, too), friendly and fast service and great food. My husband's co-workers recommended it.  My first course was homemade veggie beef soup. The waitress was right, it was outstanding, with tender, flavorful beef chunks, plenty of vegetables and a perfectly seasoned broth. No way any of this came from a can. Then came my gyro with cheese curds instead of fries (for an upcharge).  They were worth every penny - crunchy breading, flavorful, large curds and a very generous portion. I've enjoyed gyros since being introduced to them by a Lebanese chef in the 70's and these rate with the better ones. The portion of meat was unbelievably huge as well as authentically seasoned. The pita was fresh and tasty. I could only eat half of both. My husband was delighted to find corned beef hash and eggs on the menu and served all day, like all their breakfast items. It had more corned beef than potatoes. He took the pancake option and let me try them first. Good thing, because he might not have shared if he knew how good they were!. I've heard pancakes described as \"light and fluffy\", but never tasted any that really deserved that accolade til now. Add the great flavor and I could have made a meal of just them. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, and it never disappointed me. It was an accident finding the place the first time, but I easily remembered where it was when going there again.  The breakfast is great. They have large portions and good prices. The waitstaff is friendly and always willing to answer questions, fill drinks, etc. I do not think my coffee cup ever got to less than 1/2.  Standard diner fair. I've only had breakfast, but it's always been cooked to order and no complaints. I had prime rib and eggs the last time, (I guess the prime rib was from the night before), and it was a very generous cut. Spiced nicely and very enjoyable to eat. Love the american fries with onions. I plan on going back."}
{"text":"Gus's Diner was a more disappointing than I wished for a awesome looking diner place to be. The food quality of the meals just wasn't very good.   When we entered the diner, it has a retro-diner feel to it with juke boxes (non-functional) and cool decorations throughout the place. However, we got seated at a booth by the windows and there was a cold wind drift coming in and the seats were freezing! I didn't know if moving would help so I just sat on my jacket to be a seat warmer.  The meal I ordered was lackluster, the pancakes were dry and not very delicious. The eggs too runny, and the bacon was just okay. I ended up leaving more than half on it on the plate cause I just couldn't finish eating it.   Service was decent, not bad but not amazing either. Overall, what could have been an awesome experience only was as good as the place it is, go check it out for the retro-diner feel, but I wouldn't really recommend going in for the food."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and service. Food is not bad but not unique like many local spots that Make One or two things very interesting.  The oil in potatoes tasted a bit stale that's why one star off from me."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food could be a notch better--for instance, not using those crappy, over-breaded, packaged, frozen cheese curds--but the burgers are outstanding and the breakfast menu is solid.  A few things could use a touch more flavor, but overall, better than most places."}
{"text":"My go to  place  for  breakfast.  The skillet  as fantastic. Cool decor and always  lots  of  coffee."}
{"text":"Gus started out impressing me.  We have been there four times.  Each time got progressively worse.  The quality of the food steadily went downhill.  I do not believe I'll be going to Gus's again."}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT A FANCY HIGH END RESTAURANT IT IS A DINER!! With that being said I gave it 5 stars because it is everything it advertises. no more no less. Greasy spoon hearty filling food with crappy 50's deco. LOVE IT! couldn't get any cheesier. All that matters is this. The place is spotless the waitstaff are career girls for the most part(actual wait staff who have handled food before) and the food is plentiful and tasty. If you want anything more go to Pig in a blanket anything less go to any food fight restaurant in Dane county."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this place. Very fun but service has gone down lately."}
{"text":"Went a couple weekends ago for breakfast/lunch.   I had their Southwest Scramble, and hubby had their Turkey Club.  Both were excellent. No room for dessert.  Maybe next time, and there WILL be a next time!"}
