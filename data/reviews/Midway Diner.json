{"text":"Although the service was good, the food was mediocre at best. I ordered a grilled chicken breast with green beans and a dinner roll. The chicken breast was very dry and overcooked. The green beans came straight out of a can and lacked seasoning. The tiny dinner roll also came straight out of a package. My dinner also came with a salad which was the best part of my meal as I was able to make my own from the salad bar where all ingredients were fresh.  My husband and I have been working and staying at a hotel near this restaurant for the last 2 weeks and have passed the Midway Diner everyday and have never seen the parking lot full. Now we know why. This is not a place we would want to eat at again."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Use to really like the food and service. Well came in tonight they have cut the menu down to one page, and raised the price. They took all the great things away. The server tried telling us that all the food got thrown away by accident during cleaning. REALLY!!!???!!!"}
{"text":"Lake perch was yummy, service was swift and friendly. A pleasant stop on a trip through Ohio. Family left happy and well-fed."}
{"text":"Some good food and you generally get some great portions. The menu is typical for most general restaraunts like that (Bob Evans, Denny,s Ihop, etc) but it is a little better then some. Worth giving a chance at least once."}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices are great. Many specials daily to choose from also. I like the soup and salad bar. It is a little small and doesn't have a lot of variety, but still good."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go for a while and glad I finally went this morning. The restaurant was clean (very important to me!), the food good, and service very friendly and hard-working. Admittedly it's kind of hard to screw up breakfast but I have a long day in the area and so will likely go back for an early dinner too, and will create another post."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and never disappointed. The service is good and the salad bar is excellent. Try the triple decker BLT. It's great."}
