{"text":"The stars don't lie, I'm a fan! This is my families new go-to pizza place. Whether we walk-in, order pick-up or get delivery, it's always hot and crispy. Different to other places, they don't skimp out on toppings and have a great, unique sauce!  My one complaint: they are Italian and don't speak English very well, so ordering over the phone has proven tricky. We try to do half-toppings every now and then because I'm the only one who likes pineapple and so far 50% of the half-and-half order have been completely wrong. The only good thing about those mistakes was that we got more toppings than we paid for and that we all liked.   Yesterday we got their wings for the first time. SO GOOD. Not the biggest, but definitely in competition with local wing places like sneakers and tom & jerry for size. Above all they were really well cooked. They were lightly battered and fired with the sauce served on the side (for delivery). Which means they were crispy once we put the sauce on. They also gave so much sauce and they were finger-licking good!  Will definitely get the wings again."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because they don't adhere to their own business hours. I've been here several times at 11 and even 11:20 on my lunch break only to find out that they're still closed! I don't get much time for lunch so it's frustrating to waste more time driving to a new location just because they can't open on time."}
{"text":"This is the place on the news with the youtube video going around of the barefoot kid laying on the counter.  I defiantly would not eat any food that came from this place."}
{"text":"Pepperoni and garlic toppings is all you need with this delicious sauce and cheese on the pizza!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has new owners and the pizza tastes better. They are nice and friendly and the place looks clean so I'll try them more often. I had their pizza last night and it was good."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and fantastic service! Was running through the plaza on route to an appointment and thought I would give this new spot a try. Happy I did.  Probably the freshest pizza crust and ingredients I've had in a long time.  Has a great family run feel to it as well.   CREDIT CARD worked fine for me.   It's not a fancy sit down restaurant, but is a pizzeria I will definitely try again. Will probably also try their delivery."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and equally awesome meat lasagna! Since I tried this place it has become my go to spot for pizza! Great service, great quality of food and freshness! Definitely recommend everybody to give this place a try!  Prices are also reasonable and the place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Located in my neighborhood, which also seems to have become Ground Zero for an independant pizzeria uprising, is Cocelli. Granted, Cocelli was one of the first, but I've sampled them a few times, so lets see how it holds up.  Meh! Probably the most consistently meh pizza place I've been to. There's nothing WRONG with the pizza per se, but it's just so...meh. Average, maybe even slightly below average. I've given them a few chances, and I've never been impressed with their pizza. I have yet to try their wings, and chickens rejoice, I probably never will. It's a shame because it's of such close proximity to my house, but I'd rather venture farther for something not so...meh. Next.   -The preceding review has been brought to you by the letters M, E, and H."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times as my husband works down the road. The customer service has never been very good since the new owners but it was on the way home. The new owners are very rude, definitely not friendly people.   The pizza itself isn't very good. 3/5 stars honestly but we ate there since like I said it was on the way home.  I can say now though that those photos of the child being on the table I will definitely never eat at this establishment again though."}
{"text":"It's gross. Kids are running around barefoot in there climbing and jumping. The pizza was nasty.  Kill it with fire. Go to Venezia pizza 8 mins down the road. Way better"}
{"text":"I'm writing this on a scale of being a local suburban pizza place, rather than pizza overall (if you were to include high-end, authentic Italian, wood-oven, non-delivery etc...). With that in mind, it's pretty good pizza. I like the crust which isn't too doughy or thick. The sauce is good. I usually order a chicken, sun-dried tomato and red pepper pizza and it's always popular. Like the pizza, the wings aren't award winning, but still pretty good and better than comparable places. Good value and they have combos which are a fair price."}
{"text":"Great wings......barbeque are really good...... Pizza was great! Also ready for pickup when asked for"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite pizza place in Newmarket! The pizza is perfect every time. The garlic bread is sooo good and I almost always order it with my pizza. Their staff and service is friendly and fast. My only minor complaint is that I do wish that they would put a piece of parchment paper in between their garlic bread with cheese so that the cheese does not end up on one side of the bread. Update (Oct 27/17): The last time I ordered from Cocelli was a couple of months ago. When I asked if they could add the parchment paper to the garlic bread, I was told they don't do that anymore. That's unfortunate. Who wants to eat a loaf of French bread which is glued together with cheese? If they won't take constructive criticism to improve their offerings, sadly, I won't order that item any longer."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but nothing special. Ordered a veggie slice which was over 5 bucks with tax, most I ever paid for a slice anywhere!"}
{"text":"The pizzeria is clean and the pizza is very good. We ordered a vegetarian. Spinach,Tomato and Mushroom. Very good. Lots of Mozzarella and a fresh tasting tomato base. The owners work hard and they are friendly. Plenty of tables and chairs to eat in. $22 for 3 topping xlarge with 2 drinks"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I think I would. This place is brand new and I understand that there are bound to be some adjustment issues or growing pains. I understand if you can't accept debit or credit as payment methods yet. But it would have been better to know that before placing my order. Because there was no nearby branch of my bank, my order was $3 more expensive than it should have been. The pizza toppings were not distributed correctly (on the whole pie instead of only on half, and under the cheese instead of on top, as we had requested). The \"crispy\" crust was as limp as a cooked noodle, and the overall taste was oddly salty.   I can only hope that in the future the experience improves, but I'll never need to know, because that's the last time I'll visit this place."}
{"text":"Pretty average pizza joint. Went on a Sunday for slices around lunchtime and the place had not a soul in it. Slice options were veggie, pepperoni, cheese. Pizza was greasy -- probably too much for some people, but it killed my pizza craving. I liked the tomato sauce, but my family found the crust too thin."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and was pleasantly  surprised to find this place!  Love their sauce, it's just like Nonna's!! So check them out! Mangia mangia!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"On recommendation from my teen son and his buddies, I went there to order pizzas for my 7yr old's birthday party. Quality was above average, price was reasonable and the service was good.  [This review was originally written Dec 2010 but posted in 2012]"}
