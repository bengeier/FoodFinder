{"text":"First time in Cleveland, and the folks at Mel's made it feel like home. Simple, good food at a reasonable cost served to you by awesome people"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mel's Café...especially Taco Salad Tuesday!!!! I look forward to lunch everyday at Mel's Café. Angelo, (the owner) always has good food with great prices. He will never disappoint! We are a tenant in the building and having Angelo here, has been the best thing that has ever happened to the building!! I like his side kick, Beth too. We love to talk about our dogs every day!!  :) - Angelo and Beth will put a smile on your face and great tasting, always fresh food, in your stomach!"}
{"text":"The owner is so nice! Continued conversation for the entire breakfast. Great food and wonderful service. stop in! it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Much smaller than my wife and I expected but they made some great food! Check out the pictures!"}
{"text":"Best place to have your work lunch and share a nice talk with great people!! Dont miss the pressed italian!!"}
{"text":"Perfect little shop to grab a quick sandwich from. Inexpensive and fresh. Had a breakfast sandwich with turkey on a bagel and enjoyed every bite. Good quality. Friendly service. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"I used to live a few block's from Mel's and would stop by regularly on my way to work.  It is a great place to stop for a delicious omelet for breakfast and he does lunch too.  Good food, good conversation, great guy.  Just tell him what you like (or don't) and he'll make you something delicious to suit.  Or try the daily special.  He won't let you down.  P.S. I highly recommend the banana walnut bread."}
{"text":"I was looking to grab lunch after attending a meeting downtown and Mel's was the perfect choice. I ordered the hot turkey reuben which was delicious. The sandwich came with a choice of sides and I got the potato salad which was also great! As others have mentioned this is a food stand in an office building but there are a couple of tables if you'd like to sit. Thank you for the tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I work on the eighth floor and I come down almost every day.  While only open until two, I know that I can get coffee, soda or an amazing chicken quesadilla anytime.  Fridays are 'Pancake Fridays', he always has fresh, homemade banana nut bread, and the clam chowder is to die for.  I will sincerely miss coming here when our office moves at the end of the month.  He accepts card and cash, but there is a small minimum purchase for cards.  There are also a few tables available to sit down and eat if you're not too keen on heading back to the office just yet."}
{"text":"Stopped by after walking by the sign everyday on my commute.  Food was fantasic and reasonably price, a rare find in the warehouse district.  I had a breakfast sandwich and it was to die for.  The egg,  cheese,  bread and of course the bacon melded together to form a wonderful breakfast treat. It's definitely going to become a part of my morning routine."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast. Staying downtown for business and do not overpriced hotel food for breakfast. Found this place, about a 10 min walk from my hotel, and decided a morning walk would be nice.  Am not disappointed. Got there right when he was opening so I was his first customer of the day. Don't expect anything fancy, but if you want some good food for a great price this is the place.  $5 for eggs, polish sausage, potatoes and toast. Definitely will walk back here if I am in the 'Land for another trip."}
{"text":"Found this gem on a spontaneous day out and about in search of an awesome bagel sandwich. I respect/appreciate the respect I was shown at Mel's from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out. We both got a kielbasa and fried egg bagel sandwich...needless to say our taste for bagel sandwiches was overly satisfied."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast, was tired of My usual spots and I had read some pretty good reviews.  I had their loaded omelette, with sausage bacon, peppers, onions, potatoes and mushrooms...the bacon was burnt to a complete crisp and the potatoes were definitely old. Price wise I got what I paid for, only $4.25 but I wasn't impressed with the omelette. I'll probably be skipping this on my daily breakfast menu...le sigh."}
{"text":"This is just a little food stand with a couple tables in an office building downtown. The other reviews on Yelp drew us in as it was close to our hotel. We got there late for a Friday breakfast, around 10:30, so they were out of croissants. No biggie as they had been busy but get there early if you want your pick of menu items.  We had two fried egg sandwiches, one a English muffin and one on a bagel and both were wonderful! Our son had their pancake and sausage special which was just okay. The pancakes were good but a bit dense for our taste.  The owners couldn't have been friendlier. I'd would for sure stop for a quick bite again and would probably try lunch as their Italian hoagies looked delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Friendly owner! We are from out of town and glad we stopped in to this hidden gem. We highly suggest it and will be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Owner was a nice guy. Solid breakfast. This joint is kind of a hole in the wall on the first floor of a pretty cool historical building."}
{"text":"Check it out ! Angelo and Beth will whip up a great breakfast for you in this eclectic spot . Small serving area in the lobby of an historic building.   You might get one of the few tables or just grab and go.   Fun place ."}
{"text":"Angelo changes his menu daily so you'll never be bored. He makes everything himself, so it's fresh daily. Get there early because some items are so popular they sell out! My favorite is Taco Tuesday, great taco salad for only $5. I work in the building and our staff frequently gets breakfast and lunch at Mel's."}
{"text":"Mel's Cafe is a little spot a few minutes away from First Energy Stadium and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It's a great place to grab a bite if you're waiting for the hall to open or just enjoying a visit to Cleveland which, by the way, is a pretty cool place. The food isn't fancy but it is tasty and prepared with pride of craft. I had an excellent sausage and egg sandwich. My wife and daughter had omelettes with various toppings which they thoroughly enjoyed. Mel's is the kind of place where you get treated like a regular even if it's your first visit. The place is tiny and the other customers appeared to be locals who worked nearby, which we took as a really good sign. Working people don't go back for bad food. The owner is salt of the earth and the food is tasty. If you are in Cleveland on a tight budget and you want some good food Mel's is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Had a hearing at the courthouse across the street. Found this place on Yelp and honestly extremely glad I did. It seems extremely random and is as most say just a food cart inside a building. But Mel is friendly and does not come close to disappointing. Got the Western Omelet with a side of potatoes and toast. Extremely affordable and a steal honestly. Don't let this unmarked place scare you away from a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service at a great price. Make sure you try the fried egg sandwich for breakfast!  Also, the potatoes are delicious! This place was very convenient for me, as it's located at the confluence of W. 9th street, W. Huron, and W. Superior. Small restaurant, big taste!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick breakfast close to my hotel before a conference, and Yelp only had one listing within a mile. Little did I know the surprise I was in for! Mel's is tucked away in the converted foyer of what appears to be a closed business, but boy do they make the space work. Armed with only a griddle and toaster, they served me one of the best egg sandwiches I've ever eaten...FOR THREE DOLLARS. I wound up eating a second because I was hungry, but had to change my meat choice because I had eaten the last of the ham, and they are using hyper-fresh meats from a local deli. The chef/ owner apologized, which was more than acceptable since the turkey version was just as delicious.  The only criticism I have is seating (they have two small tables for a total of four seats available), but that is most likely a legal issue as I can't imagine that the rated occupancy of that tiny foyer is much more than that."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend because of the reviews we saw on yelp and Mel's really deserves the 5 stars! We didn't even know this place existed it's located in the western reserve building and are so happy we found this place. It smelled amazing soon as you walked into the door and the building was very old school which added to the experience. It's a hidden Gem though and we were beyond pleased with our food. We ordered breakfast sandwiches and lentil soup. The lentil soup was my favorite part of my meal & it's Packed with Mediterranean flavor!! The chef is a great guy and the food was amazing and quick."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp. It was really good - in the lobby of a building going through some renovation. The Kielbasa scrambled eggs were excellent and rounded out nicely with a bit of mustard."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to grab a breakfast sandwich on the way to work. They have everything from omelettes to muffins!  Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Great little café, with sandwiches, egg sandwiches, etc.  Good food, nice guy and very inexpensive.  Don't expect much in seating department but when you need lunch or breakfast cheap this is the place.  Awesome Building, café in lobby."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef Ruben and husband had the BLT both were really good and served with potato salad."}
{"text":"I love Mels Cafe. It's a great place to grab breakfast or lunch in downtown Cleveland. The owner (Angelo) is super passionate about his job and enjoys serving customers. For breakfast, I'll normally grab an egg sandwich and for lunch, I get a chicken sandwich.   Delicious!!"}
