{"text":"This place is great. Authentic flavors, locals coming by all the time, and consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 4 times and each time I'm impressed with the taste of the food and the value of the portions. The vegi biryani is exceptional and could be a meal on its own for only $4.99. The tandoori is delicious and the aloo ghobi is a wonderful side. The take out service is always quick and accurate."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant recently and i must say overall its exceptional. Price is reasonable considering the portioning and other restaurant. Food is hot and fresh. Cleanliness is good compare to other Pakistani/indian cuisine"}
{"text":"This is a real gem of a place. Real tasty south asian food. 

We've tried their garlic, till (sesame seed) and regular naan, and they are all authentic and tasty. 
- Their Chicken Biryani is an excellent base item to order. The chicken is BBQ'd crispy and delicious. The rice is seasoned to perfection, and offers a great base to add other items. 
- Their butter chicken is creamy and full of flavor (I recommend getting it spicy). 
- Their haleem is excellent as well. 

The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The turnaround time to get ordered food was fast. The seating is plentiful and comfortable. And two can eat until their bellies are bulging for about $25, which compared to other places, is a steal. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"favorite biryani place!!! the rest of the menu is also good and the kulfi so good"}
{"text":"This is the best tasting desi food I've had in Canada. The Chicken Vindaloo is great!"}
{"text":"Nice and properly fullfill my requirements. Deserve for five star rating. Economical clean and ontime service."}
{"text":"Good food. Fantastic price. Delivered by Uber.

Wonderful spices, more flavourful than other places. A nice, gentle heat to the veggies and curries. I would expect this is what a quality home cooked meal would be like if I grew up in the culture. 

A meat curry (comes with 1 naan), a veggie dish, an order of palao rice, and 2 extra naan comes to under $30 and enough for a dinner, and 2 lunches!!

The are open until 11pm, and Uber delivers to my door. 

Overall, I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"So excited to have this delicious new restaurant in the neighborhood! The butter chicken is delicious and comes with a piece of naan as well.  They offer many different kinds of naan which I love!

Their kabobs are also delicious and come with amazing rice!!  The prices so extremely reasonable!

Come out and have some tasty food!  I want this restaurant to stay so I can keep eating here!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service from the front desk staff you can ever imagine. There was a lady behind the counter when I went to order for takeout. She screwed up three times taking my order and then had the nerve to argue with me. Don't expect a smile or a thank you. 
The food was mediocre, at best."}
{"text":"Taste is great but tends to be really oily. It's also kind of expensive in my experience. The portions are not big enough to justify the price. That being said, I will continue to visit this restaurant because the flavours are quite food, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here once. Service was disorganized, portions were small and food was disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a quick, cheap source of halal south Asian food. I got the butter chicken and chicken vindaloo. As you can see in the pictures, both were extremely oily and greasy. 

The butter chicken was overcooked, and the gravy/curry was disappointing. The chicken vindaloo fared slightly better, as the overall dish was tastier, but the potatoes were too salty, and it suffered worse from the oil issue; there was almost nothing in the container after the chicken and potatoes save straight-up oil. 

I'm giving three stars since the service was quick, the food was inexpensive, and the portions were a good size - the naans that came with each curry were large (though fairly tasteless). I'd be willing to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Food was really good. 
Malay Tikka, butter chicken, Haleem, nihari to go wid till naan are the must try items on da menu."}
{"text":"My favourite desi food spot by far! There isn't one item on the menu that I could say is alright everything is exceptional any downfall they have is covered by their mouth watering food! I recommend the Garlic Naan & Chicken Jalfrizy"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went with friends and tried a few dishes at this place and was planning to give 4 stars for their food. But after getting a good service,  i immediately upgraded rating to 5 stars for food and their customer service.

Things that i liked:
- food was good and very delicious.
- service was good and reasonable,  served in timely manner.
- place was clean
- prices are more than fair - especially for quality and quantity of food. And totally worth it. This is my new favourite place from now on.


 They served us large portions, with juicy fresh meat dishes... and it only got better because the spices they use are wonderful in both taste and smell. The pita that came with the dinner was also very good  and straight from the clay oven, and you get a choice of pitas. Maybe next time I'd settle for two pitas instead of one.


The staff is also capable of providing good recommendations off of their menu.
They have convenient and a lot of free parking in front of the store.
Overall, a very excellent experience."}
{"text":"This place was our savior and provided delicious food during our move to Canada and when we were between hotels/ bread and breakfast inns. Tried a variety of items from their menu. Palak Gosht (veal) was so flavorful and the meat so tender, fresh naan right out of oven was a perfect compliment. Karhai Chicken was so flavorful with that authentic smokey touch. Daal gosht (veal) was great too. Also tried their biryani, was definitely above average. Today I am packing my weekends worth of food to carry out. Will continue my visits for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious food, very reasonably priced.  Tried several vegetarian dishes, naan, and chicken,all of them were fantastic, nothing to be improved upon!  Plenty of seating, but it seems like it's heavy on takeout, which I got.  Nice sized portions."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food tastes authentic, delivered in a timely manner, and the prices don't break the bank either."}
