{"text":"I went there for dinner, and I was surprised with the menus, because they were in chinese and english, and yet the signs outside are all in english....

We Each ordered 1 item, and shared  a plate of Low mein noodles.  These plates were huge!  I would say that it would be enough for 1.5 people.  I ordered the pad thai, which was quite good, though I like having lots of sprouts and onions in mine, and there seemed to be a lot of noodles, which wasn't a huge problem.

The service wasn't great.  One of my companion's meals came first along with our shared plate, but then me and my other companion had to wait about 15-20 minutes before ours came.... It would have been nice if everyone's came at the same time.  As well, we asked for cups of water, and they seemed to remember that we wanted water when our refill of tea came, which was quite a long time after we asked for the water.

The decor seems to be a mixture of chic contemporary with traditional chinese restaurant decor.  I can't say they did a great job, but it's ok."}
{"text":"Requirement: Bring your CANADIAN personality here.

If you're fluent in Canadian, that's perfect but if you're Chinese like myself you'll actually be a little disoriented at this Chinese Restaurant.  Maybe it's the Pan Asian Bistro theme that did it.  This is the new SISTER of Skyland De Shanghai.

The over CHIC atmosphere that is uncharacteristic to other Chinese Restaurant is available here, you can refer to their photo.  The tables have a bit of scratch to them and the chairs are Chinese themed, you get the idea by now.

Catering to tonight's 95% non-Chinese patrons and 5%(ME), we were not immediately served with a Teapot.  They offer Tea, Slush, Juice, Coffees for purchase.  The menu has that Shanghai food feel as the MAIN philosophy that probably replicates the items from Skyland.

Steamed Shanghai Style Pork Dumpling(6/$5.99) is good with a thin wrap, light CLEAN flavour soup base.  I broke 2 of them though out of 3.  A-OK.

Asian's Honey Chicken($10.99) is of Manchu Wok style Chicken where it has that Lemon Chicken aesthetic but this one is SWEET not sour.  Not my thing, but my non-Chinese friend liked it.

The server brought our Black Pepper Beef on a Hot Stone($13.99) overflowing of sauce, If you look at the photo you will know why I call this \"Lava Beef\" and it's as good a presentation point as an Onion Volcano.  A-OK

The PRICE point is a little bit high especially if you browse through the Seafood section or even the Peking Duck Specials however my Western friend felt comfortable here and quite enjoyed it as I am slowly prepping him towards more extremes, Duck Tongues and all Hahahaha! Shhhhh, Don't let him know."}
{"text":"As with many places that try to combine all ways of Asian cuisine under one roof they failed miserably. Don't get me wrong I would love to have some tai and philipino dishes mixed with dim-sam in fact, that is why I always struggle when picking where to go for dinner, but this strategy rarely works. Where do I start, the dim-sam is nothing like what I'm used to having at these large Chinese eateries where they roll it in carts, the Italian term al dente very well describes it, the spring rolls were greasy and served what I would call warmed not freshly fried. The hot and sour soup did not impress either. When we asked for tea we have been told that a pot of tea would cost us 8$, we politely refused. 
The decor is fusion of every design trend imaginable, from flowing light fixtures to waterfalls, the service is ok.
I agree with WaYnE, you've got to have no previous knowledge of real Asian cuisine to enjoy dinning here as all the dishes are refined for gweilos (white people), good though if you need a mild introduction into what Asians have to put on the table."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed and I love Asian cuisine!
We did the all you can eat (I don't think any of the other reviewers had the all you can eat)

We started off ordering many things (had a party of 5) and the food was brought quickly with many things coming at once
However, we never recieved like half the things we ordered

There were 3-5 things that were good -- the beef spare ribs were tender, the BBQ shrimp, BBQ squid were good, the spicy salt shrimp were quite good 
Other than that, we were not impressed
They definitely do not use chicken breast; every chicken dish had tiny cut up peices of some other part of the chicken and were very unappetizing
Everything is VERY greasy
We did not enjoy the tom yom soup (just a spicy tomato soup with NOTHING in it), the cold shrimp and mango rolls had no taste, seaweed salad was strangely coloured, the \"shrimp salad\" is just cocktail shrimp, the chicken with black bean and beef with black pepper dishes were FLOATING in sauce and the meat was well hidden under the red/green peppers and onions; the pad thai was weird (one order came with NOTHING, just noodles); lemon chicken was gross (mystery chicken) and the dim sum was terrible 
Even the mango ice cream did not taste good

This place is too greasy and not tasty; they have clearly traded quantity for quality (it actually reminded me of one of those food court places where they have the Chinese food out for hours under heat lamps and you can choose like a noodle and 3 sides)

Do not go here"}
