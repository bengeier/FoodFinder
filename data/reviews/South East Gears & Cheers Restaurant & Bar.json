{"text":"Was not impressed with the food here we had heard all sorts of hype about this place and finally tried it.  The mussels were ill prepared and the fries were soggy. The burger was excellent though.     Second chance worse then the first.  Sorry. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The best restaurant experience I have had in years. Even though it was a major snow storm and several businesses closed early, the manager re-opened the kitchen for us when I said it was my first visit. The garlic wings were excellent and I'm looking forward to my next blackened chicken salad.  I was very impressed the chef Aaron left the kitchen to inquire if we enjoyed our meal. Additionally he prepared the best desert for us. Five stars and I'm  looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"went on 5/10/13, the sever was very attentive and the food delicious. We had 10 people and every entree was great. The special was a skirt steak and it melted in ur mouth! Salads, sandwiches, wings, pizza, mussels, burger, salmon and steak was awesome! Stop by for bike night on tuesdays and grab some grub!"}
{"text":"Went here for New Years Eve the last 4 years and after we made our reservation they decided to put a minimum $$$ for the party without any notification or update to there web page. Poor planning and poor Customer service by the manager. On a good note the chef did a good job on the food and the band was good."}
{"text":"Seated at the table, took half hour for the waitress to ask what we wanted to drink, and another half hour to get served. That went on all night. Inexcusable, poor service. Will think twice about going back."}
{"text":"Never really had any issues until last night (11/22/16) .....Tuesday is Steak night and my sister  usually really enjoys the special, but last night it was a different story....We pull into parking lot and maybe there were about 5 cars in the lot which really surprised us, waitress was young and new we think, (never seen her before) ...we ordered our drinks which were served rather quickly, then she took our order which was steak dinner, my brother in law and myself ordered the Bourbon Chicken with baked potatoes and vegetable medley, my husband ordered cheeseburger with fries and an app, stuffed pepper....about 15 mins goes by and the waitress came to our table and asked myself and brother in law how we want our chicken cooked, REALLY?   I guess cooked enough not to see pink or red.....SMH   now it about 35 mins, no appetizer, so we called her over and she says it takes awhile to make the stuffed pepper, REALLY?  When she finally did bring out the food about 45 mins later, (mind you, only about 8 people in whole restaurant ) the pepper was one poblano pepper stuffed with look like chili, (terrible), my husbands cheeseburger was fine, then came the Steak entree which looked more like a flat pork chop, never seen a steak like that and the chicken looked like it was frozen with grill marks on it and bourbon (i guess) taste funky, like burnt? The Vegetable Medley was BROCCOLI... Hmmmm?   I thought Medley meant mixed vegetables...The menu also needs to be changed up, If they do not know how to cook these somewhat  fancy meals, they should just stick to Burgers..."}
{"text":"I have been to Gears and Cheers about 7 times. I think the quality of the food is very good. They use fresh ingredients and care about what is coming out of the kitchen. One of the best St Patricks day meals I ever had was there. Corned beef (fresh, lean, moist, and tasty), with boiled potatoes and cabbage (also very good). I also find it to be a great place to take my business clients from out of town since my office is nearby. I have never heard any of them say anything but how much they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that this place has gone downhill.  Extremely disappointed in yesterday's visit and we probably won't ever return.  Sad because it used to be great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just ate there...needless to say we regret it. We both ordered 2 different pizza's and 25 mins later we finally got our food which was ice cold. So my boyfriend then ordered a burger which was not good at all and highly charred. Later on that night and the next morning he had very bad belly pain. I really suggest that whoever owns this business please high cooks that knows what he/she is doing."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular. Would come 3-5 times a week and receive great service when Shannon and Laura were there. That's not the case anymore. I went yesterday and asked about the half price apps that the website advertises the woman at the bar says \"nope we don't have any\". Okay I know that's a lie but that's okay. Then the same waitress argues and storms off right in front of us with another employee about the drawer being short. Used to love this place and the patio probably won't go back anymore."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Good use of decorations. Started with wings. Tasty, good sauce.  Service/waitress was pleasant and good. Always a plus for a restaurant.  Now for the rest of the meal. Ordered the \"steak\" special,  tasted good, done right but really really thin  Maybe only a quarter of a inch.  Could have been used for flip steaks One member had the sliders.  Just a burger cut into 4 pieces on 4 slider buns. Over cooked  Next person had the fried peanut butter and jelly.  Hard to believe that was the best of the three meals.  Overall not sure I would return. Nice looking place but needs help in the menu"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Pretty decent bar and beer menu. The bands who play here are also really good. The only problem is the band's are way,  way, way, way, way, too loud. Bring ear plugs and the bands will sound great."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our visit and lunch today, right down to the fresh cut French fries and the music that was piped in!  This place rocks! I look forward to seeing it on a busy weekend night!"}
{"text":"Went to their bike night that wasn't too busy.  Decided to eat inside rather than eat outside where it was loud and people were smoking.  We got seated and were forgotten or ignored.   Not Going back."}
{"text":"Certainly the best patio in the Cleveland area! Artfully landscaped and so comfortable. The menu choices varied and creative. Vegetarian and Vegan offerings unique. I chose the stuffed Portabello sandwich. Would order this again. Happy Hour menu choices @$5.00 each are a real bargain. Recommend getting there early, as the patio fills with customers quickly. This place is a real gem!"}
{"text":"South East Gears & Cheers is a newer restaurant / bar in the Bedford Heights area with a motorcycle / diner theme.  There are a lot of menu options for everyone to choose from.  My visit was on a Thursday evening at dinner time.  The bar was crowded and there were quite a few tables which were seated.  I chose a table and sat down, ordered a beer and asked for a menu.  I went with the Jambalaya after asking if it was made fresh there - it was.  The food came out pretty quickly.  Overall the taste was good, well seasoned and the temperature was good.  There was shredded chicken, andouille sausage, and shrimp.  The shrimp were very fishy tasting and rubbery - obviously frozen.  The Jambalaya more closely resembled a Gumbo as there was a lot of broth - not typical of a Jambalaya.  All in all, not bad but wouldn't order this dish if I came back.  The waitress came back after I was done eating to clear my dishes and said she'd be right back with the check.  I said I would like to order another beer if I could. She brought the beer back and asked me again if I'd like my check - before I had an opportunity to start into the 2nd beer.  I said I would be sticking around for a while if that was ok.  She came back a little later and asked again if I'd like my check - I asked if she was leaving or something that I needed to close out and she said no.  Shortly after I observed the waitress talking to an older lady behind the bar and looking over at my table.  She then came back with my check - which I wasn't ready for - and advised that her manager was sending her home and that I need to close out - if I want anything else I need to go to walk up to the bar.  There was no offer to transfer my tab to the bar and the constant asking if I wanted my check was quite pushy.  I left a \"tip\" on my signed check that I didn't appreciate being rushed to close my check all night nor the manager telling her that she had to close me out.  The manager proceeded to walk over to confront me - along with her attitude.  She was trying to blame the whole thing on the waitress.  Very rude.  She then asked if she could get me something else... I said no, after I've been rushed to close out the whole evening it's apparent she wasn't interested in my spending money there.  She shook her head, mumbled something and walked away.  That level of service isn't going to keep the customers coming back.  This one definitely will not be back.  Decent place to go for food and drinks - too bad the service is terrible."}
{"text":"When my meal finally arrived 45 mins. after ordering and 10 after my partners. Chicken Alfredo with risotto was disgusting, over done chicken, rice like glue, veg like something leftover in your freezer.  Next time (If there is one) I'll stick with a burger. Server good and apologetic. Manager gave partial discount, should have comped both our meals."}
{"text":"This was pretty decent, slightly exceeded my expectations.   We were in the area visiting the Harley Davidson dealer a few doors down.  The diner in the dealership was scheduled to close in a few minutes, so we opted to go here instead.   We were seated immediately.  The server was very nice.   I ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger w/onion rings and my husband ordered the buffalo wings with a side of fries.    The burger, was hand-pattied, and cooked medium well, as I had ordered it.   The burger was topped with a thick slice of melted cheddar, 2 pieces of bacon and buffalo onion straws, which I removed after tasting (not well executed).  The onion rings were of the frozen variety, crispy and very strong.  I prefer a sweet vidalia onion ring.  My husband enjoyed his wings, they were large and meaty.   I thought that the fries were a bit overpriced.  Small handful of frozen, seasoned fries.  What I liked most was the variety of music playing over the loud speaker, everything from Alannis Morrissette  to Dr. Dre.   There were also special events posted, including live bands.   All-in-all, I would return to this restaurant/bar especially to check out the entertainment."}
{"text":"I hope this finds its way to the owner of South East Gears & Cheers.  The Good: -Great website -Great facility, very very cool interior. -Great menu -Great food - The \"ultra\" burger was one of the best I have ever had.  The Bad: -Terrible service   - First ask for drinks took 10   - Drinks took another 10,        -ginger beer served warm, no ice and only 1/2 filed glass selected.       -2 simple drinks not available, took 5 minutes to be notified   - Waitress was obviously not writing everything down and had a rude attitude   - Food took 45 minutes, one dish was never entered and took over an hour.           - No comp over cost of dish.   - Appetizers delivered with dinner   - Drink refills take 10-15 minutes - we stayed for 5 rounds.   - Bill was a hot mess.    - $18 burgers and $6 cocktails should come with better service.   Our waitress was definitely not in the game, but the bartender (/ manager?) kept making her wait while she filled her friends drink orders first. The bartender / manager was very rude to our waitress.  Simply, this is bad management. Good luck, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from friends that live in the area so we had to try it. So glad we did. Nice clean place with great outside seating. Sat at the outside bar and the bartender was very nice and helpful.  Menu has a nice selection just the right amount of choices. I opted for the veggie burger. Let me express this could have been the best veggie burger I have ever had.  Price was reasonable service was a little slow but we weren't in any hurry.  Overall when we visit Cleveland again we'll be back."}
{"text":"We were there lastnight, the patio was packed, the band was playing, people all around were drinking, dancing, eating and having a great time.  The staff was on it, for as busy as it was it still only took a moment or two to get a drink or place your order.  Very Very impressed"}
{"text":"This is a neat place that is affiliated with the Harley-Davidson dealership next door. We were told that they hold bike nights in the back with a large patio where they have a second bar and a stage for bands to play. The service was great, drinks were good, and the food was typical for a bar (good but nothing special). Overall, I was happy with our experience and would love to check this place out for a bike night!"}
{"text":"If your looking  for good food good management great prices...please look elsewhere food sucks wings are always burnt like turds,prime rib looks like salsbury steak one of barmaids make you feel like shes doing you a favor by serving you. Management if the worst place sucks."}
{"text":"We like to sit at the bar and usually receive great service.  Tonight we ordered a pizza ; did not arrive for over one hour and a half.  Beers went empty. Got mad when we finally got waitress attention to ask where pizza was and she ran back to kitchen saying it just came out.  Had pizza boxed up and when arrived home it was not the one we had ordered. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Make sure you get Kimmy as your waitress. She is very helpful and attentive. Probably one of the best waitresses we've had. We had a group of 6, ordered a lot of food and she got it right."}
{"text":"Great little local bar, with some added variety on the menu. Try the roasted peppers. You won't be disappointed at all.  Need to try the pizza and the wings also!  My son loves the bike in the game room for kids to ride. What a fun place for kids."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Great music, great barterers, great food. The atmosphere are great and mature.   It is family oriented and a secure place."}
{"text":"Food was good but staff is what really impressed me. Greeted in the parking lot and the door by very friendly staff. Kitchen staff and bartender also very friendly. Really cold beer, nice decor and very clean. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"was very surprised by the quality of the food (for the most part) .. the service was a bit rough around the edges & at times it was like talking to someone w/the \"lights on but no one is home\" sort of stare .. ordered the welsh rarebit (which you rarely see on menus anymore) for an appetizer & it was delicious .. brought most of it home since the portion is large but it did not go to waste .. they also presented us w/a huge loaf of bread that we were not expecting but did enjoy .. my husband had a grilled pork chop dinner but did remark that the corn on the cob that came w/the meal was mushy & way overcooked .. but he did eat it .. I had the cioppino .. was very flavorful & delicious .. about 15 minutes after placing my order I was told that they were out of mussels to complete the dish as stated on the menu so they wanted to know if adding more clams + shrimp was acceptable or if I wanted something else .. that was an ok alternative to me since mussels is my least favorite in the dish anyways .. about 1/3 of the way thru eating though I noticed there were also no scallops in the dish .. I asked the server & she said they were also out of those so they added more clams & shrimp (this time w/out asking & I LOVE scallops so if asked I may have opted for something else) .. I do have to say they did pile on the seafood to make up for the missing items .. + the manager took it off our bill for the inconvenience .. a welcome surprise .. we will be back since there are other items I would be interesting in trying"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Service was horrendous.  I may try it again, but the service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, the service was horrible, our food was cold and very bland.. I do not recommend the pizza, it left me and my fiancé with a headache. The positive is their karaoke was the bomb. Very good do.... if you want a night out for fun and drinks go, but make sure you eat before you go.."}
{"text":"Fun place. Bands on the weekends and Friday karroke. The venue has a little of everything. Pizza, burgers, paprikash, meatloaf, muscles, sweet potatoe fries. It was all great!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had! Other than that, this place is a gem in the neighborhood.  Really nice patio, tasteful yet hard rock decor. Staff was friendly as well. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I went for brunch this morning, and was surprised to find almost a complete lack of other customers. When we walked in, there was only one person at the bar, and one other couple at a booth. But hey, we were hungry - no waiting in line for the buffet sounded great for us.  The buffet itself is about 8 chafing dishes, as opposed to the traditional salad bar-esque type. There were also some fruit shortcakes and strawberry lemonade off to the side, and a made-to-order omelet and waffle station at the front. The dishes this week (we were told that the menu changes weekly) were biscuits & gravy, grits, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs with cheese and ham, baked french toast, roasted potatoes with onions and peppers, crustless chicken pot pie, and a mixed vegetable succotash. I tried a bit of the biscuits and gravy, a couple slices of bacon, potatoes, the shortcake, french toast, and the strawberry lemonade. The gravy for the biscuits was quite good, and the potatoes had a nice flavor, but were cut a big too large. The french toast was very eggy, but was good overall, and the thick cut bacon also had a nice flavor, but had become soggy in the chafing dish. My boyfriend tried the pot pie, and said he that liked it. The strawberry lemonade was cloyingly sweet.  Everything was very close to room temperature, which was a tad disappointing, but I suspect that has to do with the fact that the chafing dishes were not labeled - you had to pick up the lid to find out what each was. With that said, everything we had was good - better than I expected, honestly. The recipes used were thoughtful (I appreciate the under salting of the dishes), honest and accessible. The buffet isn't trying to be fancy, it's trying (and succeeding) to be good.  My only real complaints are the sort of misleading advertisement of a \"Bloody Mary bar,\" where in actuality, you could just order a Bloody Mary from the bar, and that I feel it is slightly overpriced. Brunch for two people who each had a beverage was $40 with tip. Not terribly expensive, but certainly a bit more than it should be. Those two relatively minor complaints aside, we will definitely be returning for brunch again, and bringing others along.  Unrelated to the food, the restaurant was also very clean, as were the restrooms. The serving and kitchen staff were pleasant and helpful. Overall good job."}
{"text":"I was a member of the original opening crew at SE G's & C's.  Initially I was a lead cook (then later a bartender).  At the time the original Chef Matt M. was in charge and his Sous Chef Jason made a very good & passionate culinary team. The kitchen was kept immaculate,  and the product was always fresh.  Then came all of the management changes and new kitchen crew members with little experience and low standards.  The menu was/is too big. So in a restaurant that doesn't have a lot of sales,  the product being served tends to be old.  There was too much interference from owners who were never restauranteurs, and poor managers like Karen (who hired family & friends).  The concept is just OK for it's location, but hey it's in Bedford Heights, next to a derelict trailer park & an industrial park.  During my time at \"SouthEast Sneers & Leers\" as my brother dubbed it when he visited once and was mistrereated by the then GM Diane,  I watched the restaurant stumble though an identity crisis,  3 GMs, countless kitchen staff,  terrible & inhospitable service staff (who were often drunk while at work... Brenda),  terrible wastes of resources (giant parking lot tents & the 80's band \"Jackyl\",  a complete flop orchestrated by the GM Karen)  I myself was one of the staff that cared too much,  to the point that I burned out from trying to keep up the high standards,  with a crew who just didn't care. Only to be reprimanded by management and ownership for being frustrated.  Here is the bottom line about SE G's & C's... it's a boondoggle!  It has a horrible location, it's  name is terrible, ownership have no foundation in the industry (other than the Harley diner), the standards are poor,  the staff is mostly apathetic (and the good ones burn out), the management practices nepotism at the expense of the harmonious running of the establishment,  most importantly... the customer is taken for granted!  I spent many years in the hospitality industry,  from chain restaurants to executive steakhouses,  2 things have always been immutable truths... 1) You only get one chance to \"WOW\" a new customer,  and 2) If a customer has a good experience at your establishment, they'll tell a friend.  If they have a bad experience... they'll tell 5 friends.  SE G's & C's doesn't get it,  so they'll continue to siphon money from the motorcycle dealership to float the restaurant until they can't anymore,  and then they'll close.   RIP Debbie Pearl"}
{"text":"Great place to come with your family and eat some great wings and a cold for sure I'll be back around when ever I'm in town again and also trucker friendly big parking lot in the back!!"}
{"text":"We came here twice for Sunday brunch buffet. It's wonderful! The food is every bit as good as Blue Canyon's brunch, although Gears N Cheers has a smaller selection, but it's half the price, too. To me, they cover all the bases with really nice selection of fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, sausage, French toast, sausage gravy and biscuits, plus all the lunch selections and even dessert! It's displayed beautifully, too. It's fancy food served in an unpretentious setting. The waitress was quite attentive, too. I'm looking forward to trying this place for dinner soon. Brunch buffet was outstanding. If I *had* to nitpick something, I'd say it would be nice if they labeled the food, but really, it's not rocket science and if you don't like something, don't eat it."}
{"text":"Great place for families. Antique car booths, live bands, good food for good prices.  Back patio is a nice hangout."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since it opened.  The patio is fantastic and the inside bar is nice.  The dining floor is not bad but not welcoming/cozy.  The food was much, much better when the place opened but the latest menu is odd, with the best dishes from earlier left off.  The quality of the food has simply gone down hill.  I was really hoping that it turn back around but for now it is simply a destination to sit on the patio and have a beer, which is a shame.  The servers have always been good and honest about what food to stay away from - which is mostly the daily specials.  I know it sometimes happens too but they were out of Bud Light and soup the last time we rode in.  I really wish this place would get their act together and be a place people want to go other than to just enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty cool, a lot of bikes feels fun. The place is very clean, bathrooms are as well. The beer menu is pretty large, a lot good craft Beer choices. The service was horrible! We asked for another plate and they never brought it out after we asked twice. I ordered two separate beers got the same one twice, we ordered a glass of wine and never got that as well. The food was good although my burger said it came with onion straws but they weren't on my burger."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love that stumbled upon it and met some great people. Had the chance to drink some cold beers and eat good bar food. Son and his girfriend had pizza. He wasnt happy with the sauce and the bar mgr had no problem asking what he wanted and he asked if could do a white pizza and she accommodated.  I asked about the wings and she said she loved the mild as had a nice kick. Wow was she spot on.  Love the patio and apparently they have live bands. And we were told they have a sunday brunch which we are always on the look out for."}
