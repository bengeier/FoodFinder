{"text":"Must try place. Great food! It's very clean inside and the food is also very fresh. The owner, Q, is very friendly and super helpful. 
If you're in the area, I highly recommend you check this place out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite poke places around the area! I especially love the complimentary miso soup that they give you. The miso soup was just right and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has some of my favorite poke in tempe. It's also one of the places I most regularly eat at. I'm sure all their items are great, but I get the salmon and tuna. I order it mild. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have been craving Poke since visiting Hawaii and trying it last spring. This place does not disappoint! Lots of great flavors and fresh fish, and I feel like you get a lot of food for your money. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! So happy to have a new and healthy option for lunch!!!! If you haven't tried it out yet....youre missing out! The owners and staff are so friendly and the restaurant is super clean and spotless! Since I've found this place I've come every week!!!!"}
{"text":"Was so glad to find this little gem on Mill. My husband and I were looking for a low-key place to eat on a Friday night in downtown Tempe and were hoping for something with lots of fresh ingredients. Poke2U was the perfect fit. We had only had poke once before a couple years ago in LA so were clueless about how to best order. The server helping us was great! He answered all our ridiculous questions and helped us pick the best options for our tastes. We ended up sharing a large bowl and it was plenty. Especially since it came with free miso soup! Great value and delicious, fresh food! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food!! Especially I love the Soy wrap. Definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"I love the beef in the barbecue bowl. They seem to use high quality beef and use great care in making their food. Poke isn't my thing so I enjoy getting the barbecue, but I can only assume the poke is definitely delicious and they use the freshest fish possible. Very delicious and the look of the restaurant is very nice and inviting. Ran great by a great owner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super clean. Great staff, super friendly and welcoming?.
Really fresh selection of fish and toppings. Been here several times since they have opened. Also the prices are reasonable and complimentary miso soup."}
{"text":"I stopped here to grab some thing quick. It is great and the staff is very friendly. Love my meal and it's a great price."}
{"text":"Amazing. This is my second tango with poke and considering my first experience, I was a little nervous but fear not, this place is a gem! Let's talk about this place. First, the temperature of the fish is perfect- I always worry about the fish being too warm but this place did not have that problem. Additionally, the rice was a good complementary temperature and did not cook my fish! Second, the fish was fresh, the octopus was soft and well made. The salad was crispy and fresh- no crappy wilted lettuce here! The sauce and kimchi they make in house and both are flavorful and spicy! They also offer vegetarian options and bbq bowls for folks who don't want fish. The staff is also really friendly! This place is ran by people who really care about their customers and who put that love into their food. Run to this place! And then thank me later :)"}
{"text":"I came in here in the middle of the afternoon so there was absolutely no line. We were greeted immediately and offered assistance if need be. This place has a great selection of toppings for both the BBQ and poke bowls, including cabbage kimchi (a personal favorite). I opted for a poke bowl this trip and let me tell ya, for a landlocked state, this is some of the best tuna I've ever had in a poke bowl. Custom sauce suited to your ideal spice level-don't be afraid of spicy! It's not that bad! Complimentary miso soup and tiny cucumber ' salad', in addition to my tasty poke bowl and pleasant staff made for an amazing experience. Five stars, 10/10 will return"}
{"text":"LOVED their complementary miso soup!  The sauces they used on their poke bowls are delicious too! It is different from other places I have tried. It was fresh and the customer service was great! Glad to find a place that still has great customer service! You definitely have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent poke and the included miso soup is delicious. The staff is very friendly and service is superb. The price is also very reasonable for the portions you get. Would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys poke or is interested in trying it."}
{"text":"I would want to say that this is the best poke that I had in the town. Their fish are so fresh. Sometimes I worry about having fish in hot AZ summer, but their fish temperature was perfect. The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly. You can also try their kbbq if you are not a fish person. You should check this place out!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing poke with tons of topping options. Kind enough to make gluten free bowl for me. Do yourself a favor, roll out your bed, put anything on your feet, and go. 10/10."}
{"text":"Other than Poke I have eaten in California, this was second to none.  Fresh fish, excellent add on choices, and great sauces.  It does add up to be a bit pricey, but well worth the cost if you're looking for amazing quality.

If you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot!!! Its extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I have come in to this hidden gem, I am always greeted with smiling staff and familiar faces. It feels great to feel welcome and its never super busy.

The food is fantastic and is chopsticks down the best sushi place around. It's very hard to find something healthy to eat along Mill Ave, and this is my absolute favorite.

The prices are very fair when you think about the cost of rolls and nigiri at a sushi bar. These poke bowls leave you full and the miso soup is a great ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"I've been on a poke (honestly is it poke or poki? Idk, i before e my dudes) binge these past few months, and it seems like more and more options are opening up in all the Phoenix locales, which is pretty much awesome. Think sushi meets street food.

This place is right off of Mill Ave and was open pretty late on a Saturday, so it's basically the best, healthiest drunk food you could ask for.

Out of the poke places I've been to in Phoenix, this one distinguished itself with complimentary miso soup, the options of a kbbq-style bowl (great option for those raw fish averse folk) some sort of rice paper wrap, and kimchi as a topping (crazy this is the only place I've been to that does this, I know). The portions/price ratio was pretty average, and the ingredients seemed fresh and tasted fantastic. If poke catches on with ASU students, this place is set to stay."}
{"text":"I've been here over 10 times so far. Excellent food and service each time!  Regular bowl is filling enough for lunch plus snack later.  The bonus miso soup is great.  My co-worker gets bbq bowls and they smell like heaven.

Here is my optimal order if you would like to copy me:
Regular bowl
Brown rice
Cucumber/sweet onion/crab meat
2 shrimp 1 octopus 
Mild sauce
Cucumber
Ginger
Cilantro
Soybeans
Extra crispies

They also have a punch card buy 10 bowls get the next free."}
{"text":"Midtown roots has the best flowers and they have good workers to help you find what you need ."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend staff was super friendly. I believe the gentlemen that helped us out was named Carlos!  Best part of it all is that the food is inexpensive and delicious! Who ever came up with the poke bowl idea is a genius! The restaurant is small but it's nice and clean! You can tell they take pride in what they do! Very excited to try other amazing combos!"}
{"text":"Just had my first poke Bowl. These guys really did it up right. Ingredients for fresh flavors were bold. Great service. Highly recommend for a fresh healthy alternative"}
{"text":"Korean Poke

The thing that I love about this place is that the only do they serve poke, which is taking over The Valley, but they offer Korean rice bowls with beef bulgogi or chicken. I did not have a chance to try these bowls but will try them next time. The Interior is very nice and clean and the staff was very helpful. Their portion sizes were generous and the meal was priced just right. The quality of fish was on par with most of the poke places I've been to.

I will definitely be returning to try out the Korean bowls"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their soy wrap poke burrito is sooooo good. Make sure you get tomago, and crispy onions. Plus they don't charge you extra for avocado. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was so hungry getting to my hotel airport and as hungry as I am I just refused to order off the bar menu so I decided to try uber eats. The place let's you order 3 protein with all the toppings included. Thx fish was fresh and the spicy tuna was delicious. I ordered a large bowl which was enough to satisfy my hunger and cravings. 

I would definitely go back and maybe next time go in person so I can write a better review. Anyway, if you're by the airport and hungry for poke, this place is not bad to try."}
{"text":"Didn't disapoint. My first poke bowl and it was perfect. Make sure you get the seaweed on it, it was my favorite part."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's fast and the quantity of food that you get is good, especially if you get all of the included toppings as part of the poke bowl. However, the staff can sometimes be a little oblivious as I imagine it is hard to hear behind the glass barriers. For example, I did not want any sauces but the guy putting together my bowl immediately started putting sauces in it as if from muscle memory. Needless to say, I asked them to start over and they were happy to do that. So if you have certain eating restrictions or preferences, speak up! Will continue to come here again!"}
{"text":"Fish smelled and tasted extremely fresh, restaurant was super clean, and the staff was very nice. I would defiantly eat here again!"}
{"text":"Poke was fresh and flavorful. Their miso soup was really good and complimentary. Side toppings and choices of sauce were standard. I wish they would have asked for particular sauces and not just mild medium hot but that's probably how the masses like it. 

Had some yummy drinks that you don't find every day. I would definitely recommend. Want to try their bbq bowls next."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and up charged for what it's worth. You barely get any fish in your burrito. Also, when I asked for veggies and other fillers they would give a tiny bit, that would get lost in the rice. Do yourself a favor and skip out on this one"}
{"text":"Tried several poke places and this place is one of my favorites. They have great healthy choices to add on to your poke for those of you watching what you eat, such as brown rice and EDAMAME! I love edamame!! You can pick and choose whatever you want, like chipotle, but healthier. Scoop sizes are generous and it fulfills my Asian food cravings. I'm so glad it's nearby school so I can come here all the time. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delish! Decent serving for a small bowl, enough for a light lunch. Added bonus of complimentary miso soup."}
{"text":"The poke fad has landed on mill, or at least one storefront off Mill. The fact this is just one storefront off the main drag seems to really matter as even during the lunch rush there are no more than a few customers.

Despite the name there is no true poke, nothing is pre-marinated and you just pick how spicy you want your selections and they mix up hot sauce mayo mustard and more. The options are pretty standard and avocado now costs extra.

The one nice part that earned this place an extra star was the included miso soup."}
{"text":"Awesome poke bar! Just happened to run into this place after an event at ASU. The fish is super fresh! The scallops and octopus were the best I've ever had at a poke bar! We also had a couple sushi rolls. The 911 roll is no joke, it is HOT!!! The California roll was a welcome bite after having a piece of the 911 roll. I highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for a quick sushi wrap sweet strait to the point. Quality of fish is better than ahipoke. Fresh ingredients and quality customer service."}
{"text":"I think this just might be my favorite Poke restaurant!!
The fish was fresh and the staff were super friendly. 
I really enjoyed their special sauce ... note to self, ask for more sauce next time 
One thing very different about this Poke restaurant is that they also offer non-fish items. 
Which is great when I want have lunch with friends that do not eat raw fish. 
You owe it to yourself to try this Poke restaurant. 
I had the big bowl with all the sides. It filled me up. 
You MUST try their Miso soup, I LOVED it, it was not salty at all but full of flavors. 
You MUST try this place ... 4th and Mill in Tempe."}
{"text":"I was craving poke and found this place on Yelp. I was in town for an event, so I came here before heading to the airport.
I arrived here around 12:30pm, but it wasn't busy at all as other restaurants were packed.

I built own poke bowl which I usually do, so I never had a bad poke bowl before. My poke came out good. They had complimentary miso soup which wasn't good at all though. 

Good service and good staff. Very convenience location. Walking distance from the light rail station."}
{"text":"Just went back and everything was great. Avocado was perfect and I got a good amount! Fish was fresh again and everything else was good just as before. Love how they make the sauces fresh. Makes it unique and always delicious."}
{"text":"Wow best poki in town.
I tried bbq chicken bowl taste so~ good. Miso soup is no ordiary. 
Coming back for sure ."}
{"text":"Never stop by even 0.1mile away but always order. Good?Fresh and quick order', excellent miso soup!"}
{"text":"We are walking down Mill Avenue and looking for a food around 9 p.m. on a Saturday night.
We were about to go somewhere else, but it would have required more walking. We saw this place and just hidden in a Corner next to Fuzzy's Taco Shop. And we decide to come in to get a proper meal.

Personally, I don't eat raw food. But surprisingly, they also had a barbecue beef or chicken bowl that you could order.

As a result, I ordered the barbecue beef bowl. With white rice and essentially pretty much all the toppings they had. It's like a Korean bibimbap / Chipotle style ordering. They cook the barbecue beef or they reheated the beef right on the spot. 

Taste:
The barbecue beef and everything else that was mixed with it and the spicy sauce, was delicious. I had the right amount of beef and since I got a little bit of everything of the toppings, it just all melted in your mouth. The spicy sauce could be spicier, but I have a higher tolerance for spicy food. Nonetheless, it was still good.

Also, after you finish the entire Bowl it is very filling. They also give you a miso soup on the side, free of charge. It was just a basic miso soup no tofu or seaweed, but it was free.

Environment:
Plenty of seating, clean, and spacious. The time that we went around 9 p.m., we were the only customers in there, and they do close around I think 9:30 p.m.

Rest room was clean as well.

The server and cashier were both super nice.

Price:
I believe for a regular barbecue beef bowl, my total was around $9.36, or something around that.
They do have a larger size, but the regular side was good enough for me.

Not too cheap, but a semi reasonable price for the quality of the food.

Would definitely recommend coming here, if you're craving a decent and filling meal, before a night out on the town. 

PS
I did try a little bit of the Poke, and what I did try was good as well."}
{"text":"I just had a small poke bowl delivered for lunch and it was perfect! It seems like you get way more for the small bowl than the large one. This time the ratio of the rice to fish to topping was perfect! It also came with a delicious miso soup, a perfect pairing made for a great lunch! 

Definitely getting the small bowl from now on!"}
{"text":"Tried it, loved the food. Great price for the quantity of food you get. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and I haven't stopped raving about it since i came back home east. The server was very helpful as it was my first time there. I tried his recommendations and it was delicious. Awesome food"}
{"text":"Pretty good for my first time at this location. The bowl looks big buy don't let that fool you. The portions are okay, nothing to rave about considering the portion sizes you get from other poke places. Price is higher than others but that's probably because it's in ASU territory. Overall it was decent."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite poke place in Arizona!! Definitely worth the price and amazing qualities and portions. So glad to have found a place remotely close to what I get back in California. They also offer barbecue bowls for those of you who don't like raw fish, and a huge beer and Japanese beverage selection."}
{"text":"Overall this was an average poke experience. Compared to other places I have been the serving size seemed smaller at this price point for three proteins. Wish I would have been able to choose my sauce instead of just the 'spice' level I wanted. I swear for the non-spicy option it looked as though they added in mustard. I had both the spicy and regular tuna in my bowl and they were fresh."}
{"text":"By far the best place for poke. They have a huge variety compared to other places. Ingredients are always fresh and delicious and they offer free miso soup with your purchase."}
{"text":"New Poké place in town! Ohhhhhh yeahh! As an avid Poké fan, I had to give Poke2U a try. This place is tucked in the inside corner of 5th and Mill, a prime spot for anyone just walking on Mill and craving some great food. What's unique about this place!? They serve both Korean BBQ bowls and Poké bowls! I tried the Beef BBQ bowl, and the meat was cooked perfectly-slightly chewy but melts in your mouth as well. Also, there is free avocado! I highly recommend this place because if Poké doesn't float your boat, then the BBQ bowl will surely give you reason to come back."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot. I've tried it all, but my fave is the bbq beef. Poke cooked? Yep. 
A little disappointed they are now charging a dollar for avocado, but it isn't stopping me from multiple visits."}
{"text":"Pros and cons after my first visit.
Pros: the fish tasted great as did the sauce. I'm not sure what the sauce was....I asked for medium and got a myriad of different sauces to make up whatever \"medium\" was but it was good. They had crispy garlic which was a good addition. They also offered free miso soup. 
Cons: the bowl was full of mostly rice and lettuce which made it hard to eat at the beginning without spilling toppings. The biggest problem is their scoop sizes for the protein. It's clearly smaller than local competitors like Ahipoki Bowl. I don't expect a ton of fish but it's less than Ahi overall for the same price. 
The funny part is they were training a new kid. His trainer explains what he should ask me at the lettuce station (not addressing me). When he was done the kids just says, \"so what do you want?\" to me which is an inappropriate way to address a customer. 
Good to try but I'll stick with Ahipoki Bowl in the future."}
{"text":"Needed a place to fill up my stomach before the Arizona Strong Beer Festival and came across Poke2U along Mill Ave! What a hidden gem! I ordered the seaweed wrap with tuna and spicy tuna blend which included all the usual fresh poke ingredients. The meal came with a free bowl of delicious miso soup as well. The staff was super friendly. For those into craft beer, they have a few local brews on draft. If you're on Mill and have a craving for poke, this is your stop!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat poke bowl. The 
food was great and the service was great. I highly recommend eating here. All their service staff were very helpful and welcoming. My Server was Destiny she was great and had great recommendation wen choosing how to make my Bowl. Thank you Poke2U for a great Lunch."}
{"text":"Just tried Poke2U this week and was very impressed. The fish was super fresh and there are tons of options to add on. For less than $10 the portions are really great. Also I got a free bowl of Miso soup with my order which is always a good thing. My new favorite poke spot!"}
{"text":"So poke bowls are all the craze now and hitting the desert with full force.  They still can't touch the stuff you can get back in the 808 state but it is hard for me to saw no to raw fish.

Same deal with the other places.  Pick either rice or greens, then your protein, sauce, and toppings.  I went with brown rice, 2 scoops ahi and 1 scoop salmon.  A bunch of the toppings with medium heat sauce.  This is where I got weirded out as the guy pocked up 3 different squirt bottles to make the sauce.  Usually places have it pre-made so I surprised that the fish took to the sauce.  Got a bonus cause the regular size bowl came with a miso soup.  

All in all this place is pretty solid.  They also offer other dishes like bbq chicken, ribs, and beef.  And after talking to one of the guys, they will be serving alcohol next week.  This is smart especially trying to compete on Mill Avenue where the ASU students live.  There prices are comparable to the other places, especially since they give you 3 scoops of protein instead of 2 on a regular order and a miso soup.

I still like Pokedon better but if I am too lazy to drive, this place is around the corner which is a plus for a lunch spot.  I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Incredible. Absolutely incredible. The fish is fresh and the sauce is made in house providing a superior advantage above the other poke places in Tempe. They even have options for vegetarians like tofu and tamago. Also for customers who dont like fish they can order their amazing and delicious Korean bbq which is prepared fresh for you before your eyes. Furthermore, they have a whole bunch of varying toppings that you can choose from with no limit to how many you choose. To compliment the food, the staff is very welcoming and friendly, always offering miso soup on the house. Hand of applause to you Poke2u"}
{"text":"Top notch sushi in a bowl! So delicious. You pick the fish you want, and they help you with the flavors. You also can pick what extra toppings you want--like a Chipotle except for Sushi :) You get a lot of food for your money, and their complementary miso soup is so so good. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I order from ubereats all the time and go whenever im not lazy. The workers are super friendly. 12/10"}
{"text":"I was skeptical as I've been well versed in poke on all the islands.  Rest assured, those new to poke and veterans alike... you will not be disappointed.  My skepticism was met with a friendly staff and most importantly, food bursting with flavor.  Foodland has nothing on Poke2U. Next time I'm here I'll be getting the large and spicy.  

Suspect you can't go wrong here with any of your choices kind of place."}
{"text":"Landed in the PM and was looking for a quick, relatively healthy bite and was glad to find that this place was open until 10pm. 

Prices are a little steep surprisingly for a New Yorker like me, but I loved that the toppings were all inclusive and provided enough variety without leaving a dent in your wallet.

It looks like they serve Korean BBQ bowls too, which is cool!"}
{"text":"ASU finally got a really nice Poke joint in its area. I guarantee you will love it. Fresh foods and awesome staffs. Try it!"}
{"text":"This is decent poke! The bowls are very basic: rice, side, fish, sauce, toppings. The ingredients were all high quality and sufficient portions for the price. I got white rice, tuna, avocado, and medium spicy sauce. It was good! 

The only thing I didn't like was you can't pick your sauce, you can only pick the spicy level, and they give you too much of it in my opinion. It's a creamy spicy sauce, and they make it in front of you. It was okay but I would've rather just had shoyu or something simpler because I don't like creamy food. Now that I know how it works, I'll just ask to omit the mayo next time. 

The topping choices are good, but I would've loved if they had crispies! They also offer beer - but no oranges for the Blue Moon. It's definitely good poke - but with room for improvement. Either way, I'm so glad to see poke on Mill Ave. I'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I never expect much for Arizona seafood, I love Poke so much it's probably my favorite part about visiting Hawaii. This place nails it. I've gone every day in a row for the last week."}
{"text":"Pretty decent poke in Tempe!!! And really convenient using PostMates!

I decided to try this place out since they just opened and was giving a good deal on PostMates for free delivery. The red bowls are really cute too for presentation pur

The ordering process was pretty familiar and easy to get around, and I was super surprised to know our poke orders came with miso soup! Cool! 

Okay so Poke2U is not the best poke I've ever had, but it's still pretty decent to be completely satisfied when you have that sushi/poke craving. 

They have the essentials, with the raw fishes and normal poke ingredients and sides. It was pretty cool to see additions that you usually don't see on a poke menu, such as kimchi, however I feel like it doesn't go well with it.

They are MISSING some key ingredients that made me wonder, maybe they forgot to add it in the online app or something? There was no seaweed strips, sesame seeds, and NO SAUCES to choose from! That's what threw me off! Usually I'm used to having a House sauce, citrus sauce, garlic Mirin sauce, etc etc, but there was non of that. And that's pretty common in all poke places. Very odd. 

The rice was cooked well and the portions were normal. I'll definitely come back here just for the PostMates add however I would understand if someone thinks it's kinda expensive. I think it was $13 for a large bowl, kinda pricey. 

Tips:
1) ask for extra rice, they'll usually oblige
2) fill up on extra sides like seaweed salad, or edamame, they usually don't put a lot anyways so I always ask for me. 
3) ask for your wasabi on the side or in a cup. I usually like to mix my own concoction with soy sauce kinda like when you eat sushi 
4) they also have chicken bowls too for the people who don't like sushi or raw fish"}
{"text":"Super good poke! I tried their Korean BBQ bowl first and had to go back for actual poke. Spicy tuna didn't let down at all. Brought another friend the second time I went and we weren't let down. 
So happy to have poke near me that's awesome."}
{"text":"I had to stop into to the newest Poke restaurant in Tempe to try their wide variety of proteins.  They offer both a bowl meal or you can have your Poke as a wrap.  Different from other competitors, they also offer both beef and chicken BBQ options for those not fond of raw fish. There is also Tofu and Tamago offered for the vegetarians in the group.

Poke2U has four different sauces from no spice to very spicy.  To complement my selections, I also ordered a cup of Miso soup that is made onsite with a lot of love.

Just west of Mill Ave in Tempe at 4th St."}
{"text":"The prices are actually very reasonable. I've been to many poke places. The regular has 3 scoops of protein, for a better price than all the other places. They're a little stingy in toppings, but it was yummy, regardless."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Fuzzy's and noticed this cute little place. I never hade Poke before but I am a fan of . The staff is friendly, the establishment is clean and the food is great. I have not tried the BBQ bowls but I will soon as this is a weekly treat for me!"}
{"text":"This is not the best poke I've had but it is ok. It looks to me like most of these reviews were written by employees. There is no way that this place would get 5 stars otherwise. I do like the fact that they give you some free miso soup with your order, though."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on grub hub... Im so glad I decided to try it out...  I always order the poke bowl and love it every single time!"}
