{"text":"OK.  Now were talkin'.  The food here is yummie-delicious.  I had 2 quesadillas-one w/chicken and one w/mushrooms.  What a delightful surprise-especially the mushroom.  Everyone loves my special mushroom dishes and this one at La Palapa is just a different taste profile and better than mine.  A friend of mine had the mole-she is an excellent cook and loved the mole.  Another friend had chorizo quesadillas and also had great appreciation for his dish.  We also had the watermellon juice which I believe was special for the day.  I've only had this concoction in Soho in NYC (much more $) and this libation equally good and in prettier glass.  And the price-forget about it-downright cheap.  Can't wait to return and have the dessert.  I love flan and I'll bet theirs' is excellent.  I was there on Th. afternoon and 2 other tables were taken-so you should be able to find accomodations.  I couldn't be happier to have this place in my neighborhood-never leave!!"}
{"text":"No liquor, had very good hot sauce, made me have the toots after but all Mexican food does lol. I would give this place a try if you're looking for a chill Place to eat it but you can also get out of quick."}
{"text":"Our table at lunch was impressed with the homemade chips and guacamole. I ordered vegetables and pinto beans as the sides for the vegetarian fajitas. Tasty dish overall, and I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the vegetables!  Will plan to go back and order the award-winning vegetarian soup!"}
{"text":"This is the best tasting Mexican food I have found! The place is small, but it turns out huge flavors. This food is not coming out of a can, jar, or freezer. It is fresh ingredients slow cooked like homemade food should be. The restraunt is quiet, has prompt service and a friendly staff that is eager to satisfy you. I have never written a review for anything before, but I was so blown away by their food I had to write one. Try the lamb shank, beef tounge, or flautas. They're all amazing. I'm a picky eater and my only regret is that I can't eat there everyday."}
{"text":"Very legit and authentic Mexican food. You will not be disappointed. Probably the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I decided to visit La Palapa for lunch, none of us had been yet, and I couldn't remember the name for the life of me (kept referring to it as \"that place where Thai Me Up used to be\"). After walking for 15 minutes or so on a hot August afternoon to get here, we were pleased to find that they had A/C, albeit a window unit above the door, but it kept the space cool enough that we were comfortable.  The first thing we noticed is the change in decor. Everything is brighter, the space feels a lot more open and welcoming. Our waiter was with us immediately, gave us menus, and quickly went down the list of drinks. One of the options was a pitcher of margarita mix, which means that as several other reviews have previously mentioned, they're BYOB and welcoming of your booze. Unfortunately, no margarita pitcher for us since we all had to head back to work before long.  A couple orders for appetizers were put in - the beef empanada, and chips with guac. My first thought was that the chips and guac were a bit on the pricey side. When they came out, though, it was a healthy serving of chips clearly made on-site and a decent amount of guac, both of which tasted great and were worth the expense. The empanada was also good.  For a meal, I went with a beef quesadilla and chicken quesadilla, which were both delicious though I was partial to the beef. Also, the right amount of food - enough to satisfy, but not make me feel like I was rolling back to the office.  Overall, definitely a nice experience, and we'll be back before long."}
{"text":"The Palabras Corn Soup is FANTASTIC! I would recommend stopping in - the menu looks great. I had the quesadilla and soup. Very affordable and friendly staff."}
{"text":"\"They told us to leave even we made a reservation with them on Saturday night.\"   We booked a table for 5 people on Saturday night 2/20/16 at 8 pm. We changed the plan of coming at 7 pm because when we called, they have no space available at 7 and want us to come at 8 pm. When we arrived, they told us that they don't have the chairs for us and want us to come back in an hour.   They told us that it is not their fault and they turn down people all the time. My question is, do you turn down people with reservation? How would you take a reservation but didn't reserve the table and chairs for the customers.   We would recommend the waiters not to be rude to the customers and told them to leave."}
{"text":"This place excellent! I have been there twice now and will go back every chance I get back to Pittsburgh.  Entrees: The first time, I got the Mole Poblano con Pollo. It was excellent. I am rarely impressed by moles at restaurants but I took a chance and was thrilled by how good it was. The chicken was flavorful and tender and the mole flavor was complex and truly mouth-watering. The second time I went, I got the Lengua en Salsa Verde. The meat (locally sourced) was tender and flavorful and the salsa verde had lots of flavor with the perfect amount of heat.  Sides: For both entrees, the accompanying rice and beans were delicious.  I also got the soup special: nopal (cactus) and corn soup...savory with the nopal providing a uniquely flavored crunch. Dessert:  Finally, I had coconut flan with raspberry drizzled on it...I am not much of a sweets person, but the flan was perfect and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Whatever the tilapia special was today, it was amazing and compelled me to write this five star review! Service is always friendly and I like the low key vibe. I really enjoy the palm salad and it's unexpected but delicious combo of beets, pinto beans, hearts of Palm and an amazing cilantro dressing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in South Side and perhaps all of Pittsburgh. Have never had anything I didn't like. Great food and service. BYOB. As at the top of my list when trying to decide where to eat!"}
{"text":"My lunchtime favorite. I usually get whatever is on special, and it is always delicious.  Chilaquiles--oh my god.  Plantains topped with ground beef and guacamole.  Excellent homemade soups--poblano with cream, lentils with bacon, tortilla.  The meat fillings for tacos, enchiladas, etc. are tender and well-seasoned.  Even the standard rice-and-beans sides are exceptional compared with what you usually get at a \"Mexican\" restaurant. They serve whole stewed beans, and the rice is cooked from scratch and seasoned (i.e., not from a box).  Skip Mad Mex, which is overpriced and always disappointing.  La Palapa is the best Mexican restaurant in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Finally a real Mexican restaurant with real Mexican food and real Mexican ingredients! !!  My family and I moved to Pittsburgh 4yrs ago from California. We hadn't had a real Mexican meal with authentic ingredients and atmosphere. We felt at home!   This is the ONLY real Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! !   And we'v been to all of them."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and you get so much for the price. I ordered a fish taco, a chicken quesadilla and a barbacoa quesadilla. I was too ambitious but managed to try all of them. The chicken was my favorite. They used a decent amount of meat in all of them and the tortillas were clearly freshly made and yummy.   It is a small place but great for a date or low key night out. The staff are all very friendly and our waiter was very attentive. I don't think they have ac but they had a fan on and it wasn't uncomfortable.   No complaints. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.   Had the chips and salsa and guacamole. All three dips were homemade and really good.   I had three different tacos. They were good but very similar to the Pgh taco truck. My other guests had the tortilla soup which they said was the best they ever had. Very authentic!!!!   Service was great but we did get there at 12 and it wasn't busy. By the time we left it was crowded and there was only 1 server for he entire place.   They use square for credit cards and ring you up right at your table. Finally someone that gets this. Great way to pay.   Def will go back and try some new items.   The place was very clean and certainly a unknown gem!   They also do catering and could be great for steeler games or parties."}
{"text":"I was on my way back into town and saw their sign; figured was worth a shot. So glad I stopped. My ranchero burrito was brilliant. Wish they would come to Oakland."}
{"text":"Muy Delisiosa! (I don't know if that is technically correct) I'll definitely be back to this cozy, very delicious Mexican restaurant as it hit my need for yummy spicy food."}
{"text":"I ordered sopapillas and asked for honey instead of the strawberry sauce. The waitress (who was awesome) said she will check if they have honey. She came back and said they did - but when it came out they were plain. She came back and apologized that there was a misunderstanding.  The owner walked through the door a couple minutes later with honey...he went out and bought honey just to complete my order.  If that isn't amazing service then I don't know what is.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stinks that it's on the South Side, but La Palapa is one of the best Mexican joints in the 'Burgh.  They told us they were inspired by Mexico City & it's nice to see something other than the typical Americanized Mexican in a restaurant.  The platters are a really good deal.  I highly recommend them- they can easily feed three or even four people."}
{"text":"Two words describe the food here: Fresh and authentic. The is Mexican food establishment metamorphs traditional Mexican cuisine into gourmet zest! Not to mention all the amicable service! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food is authentic and flavors are awesome.  For appetizers we shared the Tamel and the chips and 4 cheese dip.  The tamel was so tasty and the house made chips were practically impossible to stop munching on.  Next I had the flautas de barbacoa and it was almost as good as eating dessert.  The meat was tender and flavorful and the flautas was crispy and crunchy.  Simply delectable.  My suggestion: ask for a side of crème fraiche for dipping.  My BF had the local braised beef tongue which was also delicious from the few tastes that I had.  He was also very pleased. Sad that I wasn't able to order a margarita or a beer, but I will remember to bring my own booze next...and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"Allegheny county health department shut them down for violations of unsafe temperatures, rat, mice & roach infestation."}
{"text":"A new favorite! I lived in rural southern Oregon for many years, and mourned the absence of real, home-cooked Mexican food in Pittsburgh when I came here 14 years ago. Things have improved somewhat since then, but I still hadn't found a place that filled that hole - until I came here.   My significant other and I brought my daughter here for dinner to celebrate her birthday, and relished every bite that was laid in front of us. We started with chips and guacamole - warm out-of-the-fryer chips, not too salty, and fresh guac. Heaven. I had the special - tilapia stuffed with spinach with tequila sauce, a fresh, light sauce with chopped tomatoes that was delectable. S.O. had the seafood stew, which he devoured and said contained the best mussels he'd ever eaten. My daughter chose the fajitas, which she also raved about.  The seating area is small, but we got right in even on a Saturday night, and the staff were super-friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went there tonight for dinner.  I had Horchata (first time I've had it so can't really compare, but it was tasty).  Chile Rellno which was great.  Chips and guacamole - guacamole was very fresh.  Then I had three tacos - chorizo, fish, and pulled pork.  All of them were large with substantial amounts of very flavorful meat.  The total was $25 with tip so it isn't extremely cheap, but if you just want a meal the tacos itself were about $11.  Our waitress was very sweet and helpful.  Of the mexican places I've been to recently in Pittsburgh (place below Reyna's, Mad Mex, Cantina)  I would say this is the best.  The only bad part is no alcohol but it is BYOB."}
{"text":"I feel bad to give it three stars, but the food was just okay for me. I came here for lunch so it wasn't that busy. The service was good and the food came out fast. Chips were good, but I found the guacamole missing something. I usually love guacamole, but this one didn't reach my expectation. The meat in my barbacoa taco was too dry. The beef tongue my friend got was much better. We shared a pork chop dish. The pork was okay, but the sauce was really flavorful.   I don't know whether it's too authentic or I ordered the wrong items. Not sure if I'd like to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! The pico de gallo is perfection, the guacamole is amazing! I had a bowl of the creamy corn soup and fell in love! It's small - probably 8 tables. I've been here twice and will definitely go again and again!"}
{"text":"Been here once. Food was good and price was right. We can recommend the tamales. It's a small, family-type restaurant, BYOB. Nothing fancy but you'll get a good, authentic-tasting Mexican meal here."}
{"text":"Every Mexican restaurant I dine at, I order chips and guacamole so I've had quite the variety. This is THE best homemade chips and guacamole you can get in the 'Burgh!  You will not be disappointed. Not one flavor overpowered another and the texture was a creamy smoothness with a few chunks of avocado. Just a hole in the wall type of place (I think I counted 9 tables) but excellent atmosphere and very welcoming.  Service was worth a full 20% tip."}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am downing the last of their wonderful Tortilla Soup, which blows everything else out of the water (I'm looking at you, Chik-Fil-A).  My wife and I love Mexican food, and in the past our default restaurant had been El Camp Monroeville, which is not terrible but too salty in terms of both price and taste.  I first came to know La Palapa thru their stand at the now-defunct Public Market, and every since they have never failed to impress in terms of both food and people.  I love stopping by here on the way home from work, and picking up fajitas for my wife, and my usual Burrito Steelers for myself.  La Palapa is also very appreciative of their Armed Forces clientele.  For these and many more reasons I highly recommend stopping by if you haven't had the opportunity to yet."}
{"text":"Amazing Place! Truly authentic, The service was great. Small in space huge in taste. Variety of fresh to order dishes. Vegetarian friendly. Portions are so large! You will most assuredly have a take home bag.  We will must assuredly eat here again when in The Burg.  Also they have a Food Truck in the square. So yes enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Byob, great authentic food, and nice service.  I have been there 3 times and have consistently been impressed!!  The restaurant is pretty small, so make reservations, bring a bottle of wine and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly fresh and delicious.  The waiters were super nice and patient.   We are vegetarian and there were plenty of options available. Everything we had, from the Sopa de Tortillas to the Rajas Tacos, to the Torta, were amazing."}
{"text":"I used yelp to find a restaurant on Carson Street. This restaurant popped up and I must say the 5 star reviews were right. My friend and I shared the chicken fajitas. They were one of the best fajitas I have eaten. Everything was very fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh Mexican food. The best in Pittsburgh so far! It's like having abuela in the kitchen at home- quality ingredients, much skill, and love that shines through."}
{"text":"After stumbling upon their stand inside the Public Market and being told that they have a full restaurant on East Carson, I made it a point to check it out as soon as I was able.  This is one of the great Mexican spots in town, easily. My go-to when trying a new place is always enchiladas and theirs are excellent. I also enjoyed their lengua entree.  It's just a little bit more expensive than, say, an Emiliano's, but you're not likely to regret your visit here."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, large portions, tasty guac, and friendly staff. Everything you could ask for. It's a bit small though, so more recommended for 2-4 than a big group."}
{"text":"Great food.  New place that is quaint and cozy!!! Cool Mexican art gallery too.  They make the guacamole fresh and we love their mole sauce. Lots of great amd authentic choices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went here last week on a chilly weeknight for some decent Mexican food. I've been here before. Coming from the Southwest, passable Mexican food is very difficult to find here and La Palapa delivered. We got a handful of items and shared and enjoyed all of it with some minor gripes. The food is Mexico City-style Mexican food so its a bit different than the Sonorran style that I am used to.  We started the meal with chips and guacamole. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, they do not offer complimentary chips and salsa, which we found odd. But the guacamole was great. Billed as \"best in the city\", I would have to disagree. Mine is slightly better but the guacamole is great. There were a couple of the little black/brown stem thingees in the guacamole. The chips were really oily, though. Which was a bummer. We were there to pig out, though. So we dabbed off the oil and enjoyed the appetizer.  I ordered the Chuletas de Puerco which is a big pile of pork chops and potatoes plus rice and beans. They smothered it in a salsa verde (green sauce). The pork chop did have bones and with all the sauce, its hard to see where the bones and gristle end and where the tasty pork chop begins. The beans were awesome and the rice was fluffy with corn mixed in. The salsa verde wasn't spicy at all and I had to douse the whole thing in some heat. Not a big deal, I understand the typical Pittsburgher is a total wuss when it comes to heat so they have to make it to taste.  My woman ordered a couple chicken quesadillas and I order a chicken tamale for us to share. They also provided a small tortilla warmer with some deliciously soft corn tortillas (my favorite). They were great to sop up the various sauces. Her quesadillas were fairly small but the chicken tasted pretty good. They came with the guacamlole, crema fresca and a pico de gallo on the side.   No horchata for the night and they were out of Sprite. But my woman ordered a Mexican Coke. She had to ask for a cup of ice, even though the Coke was warm. The water also had very few ice cubes in it and, by the end of the meal, the ice had all melted. Maybe they didn't think we needed ice, with it being so cold outside. Or maybe they just have a drastic ice shortage in the restaurant.  The biggest negative was that the table size is peculiarly tiny! We ordered one entree and a few small things and, with beverages, hot sauce and tortillas, we had to stack things in order for everything to fit. The tables are pretty much large enough for a two beverages, two entree plates and maybe a squeezed in tortilla warmer where you can find room. That coupled with the oily chips, stems in the guacamole and the lack of ice put a damper on the meal.  The food tastes great. But the delivery seems to be lacking."}
{"text":"Experienced the La Palpa Buggie today at the north shore.   Tacos and quesadias are pretty small.  Its more of an appetizer.   We tried the quesadias today - one of each - chicken, beef and pulled pork.   3 for $10.00.  I liked the pulled pork.  It was fun. Plenty of benches facing the point.. to sit and eat at. The taco size was very similar to the quesadias.  Salsa, cilantro and sour cream is available -self serve at the front of the truck.  Forks and napkins were provided - nice (some food trucks do not provide).   I have found most food truck/buggie prices are above average. You really pay for the convenience and experience of it all.  Hey yinz.. sometimes its worth it."}
{"text":"Going to give 4 stars to the posole, but mole was 2 stars. Super nice waiter and delicious horchata."}
{"text":"I visited La Palapa with a friend on a Friday early evening.  It wasn't very crowded when we came in but it filled up around 7 pm.  It's a small joint - the former site of Thai Me Up - but when filled it wasn't loud.  The lighting is warm and the restaurant seems inviting.  The staff is incredibly nice.  They were really accommodating with seating requests and such.    The restaurant is BYOB and they offered to chill the white wine we brought while we waited.    I thought the food was rather good, especially for Mexican in Pittsburgh.  I think this is the closest thing we have to \"real\" Mexican food within Pittsburgh city limits, especially due to the demise of Mexico City (health code violations = death).  The chips were good - they reminded me of the style they serve at Las Velas, but seemed fresher and tasted better than those at Las Velas.  The guacamole tasted very good, although I didn't really think about it much at the time.  I ordered enchiladas which were marketed as being able to be served with chicken or beef, but the waiter told me I could have any meat listed at the bottom of the menu (this included chorizo, I believe seafood options, et al.). I chose pulled pork.  I thought the pulled pork enchiladas were very well done.  The pulled pork itself was moist and marinated well.  The corn tortillas (you can choose corn or flour for all dishes - this is great for me, who tries to avoid gluten) seemed really fresh.  I've been a lot of places where the corn tortillas fall apart easily, or where they are stale.  I was really happy with my meal as a whole.  Another plus is that they will run your credit card at your table with the ipad, and you can choose your tip portion by percentage.  I thought that was nice.  Overall - I thought this was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The fried stuff is a little too oily (aka chips or flautas). But the quesadillas are to-die-for!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.   I came here with my colleague/friend on the July 4 long weekend while visiting Pittsburgh. Decided to try the place before we headed out for clubbing on South side.   The portions are pretty generous for the price, atleast coming from NYC feels the portions are good and without compromising on the quality.   The sauces are pretty good. The chips we had ordered were too oily. Mentioned it to the partner/hostess and she was apologetic saying they make it fresh and the person in kitchen might not have rested it to let the extra oil drain.   Verdict - A good Mexican place on South side. Definitely worth vist(s)"}
{"text":"Let's start by stating the obvious: Pittsburgh is a Mexican-food desert. (Note to the 'Burgh: hard shell 'tacos' are not tacos, guys.) Time and time again, I have been disappointed in the American-inspired Tex-Mex being paddled here as authentic Mexican food.   But La Palapa gives me hope, they have the most authentic - and delicious - Mexican food in town, the service is super friendly, and the space is lovely too. Highly recommend if you want some real Mexican food for a change while in PGH."}
{"text":"It is not one of the over-the-top hipster taco places that serve octopus legs in yo taco. Their food is just like the people who run the place- Their food is so so good, without the frills. Down to earth people w great service. Their food portions are HUGE and is packed with flavor and is priced well.  Love them and will keep going back.  Update: After going to them at least 2+ per month for the past 6months, they have moved to a new location, close to Birmingham bridge exist on E.Carson St.  I was excited to go support their new location. Service was a bit slow, wrong orders, very slow drink delivery. This location is no longer BYOB but does have a new extensive alcohol menu It seems to be on an upwards trend to make it a more \"upscale restaurant.\" I'm really happy that they're doing well, but I really hope that they keep up the mom/pops friendly and down to earth atmosphere as well. IT is what kept me coming back over and over. I know they're planning on adding more fancy things on the menu, but I do hope that they keep everything else the way it is.  I will certainly keep coming back and hope that the kinks will have worked out in the near future!"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food i have ever ate The food was disgusting and too pricy for the quality they provide.  The vegetables were frozen and not fresh. The beef was not well cooked. They charge us extra for chips , that was strange."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is lovely and the food is the best! Try the tamales. They do tableside guacamole which is truly fantastic. Their decor has a lot of very fun Mexican folk art (and it's for sale!) which adds even more authenticity to the experience."}
{"text":"A few friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday night. When we walked in at 7 pm, our table was waiting for us and every other table was taken. The atmosphere was nice, everyone talking and enjoying themselves. We brought two fifths of tequila with us and they will supply the pitcher of mix for you. It costs $12 per pitcher, and I believe they charge $3 per person to byob. Still a good deal. The waiter was fast to welcome us and very friendly.  He brought out salt and limes as well as ice. We ordered the guac and chips, the queso, a chile rellano, and I asked if they had a bean dip which they did not. The guac was delish! The chips were def homemade and a little greasy, but still crispy and tasty. The queso was watery, the flavor was good, but the cheese just dripped off of the chip. I prob wouldn't order the queso again. They tried to accommodate us with a \"bean dip,\" but it was more like they poured some beans on a plate and served them. They weren't good. I appreciate them trying, but for $5, I'll pass next time. The chile rellano was FABULOUS.  I ordered the enchiladas with the mole sauce. The mole sauce was the best I've ever had. Flat out delicious. I ordered two mushroom and one cheese enchiladas. The mushroom enchilada was on point, very very good. My meal came with a side of veggies and rice. Both tasty. Our waiter did bring our chicken fajitas when the one girl ordered steak, and my other friend had her order a little messed up also. That is the only reason this place doesn't get a perfect 5 stars. I would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Would give this place a 4.5 out of 5. It's nice that you can sit down and relax, and the food is very excellent but it's no Las Palmas in the taco department, the taco's just aren't quite as flavorful, close but not quite. They also were very messy, both of my tacos fell apart on the first bite, that does not happen at Las Palamas, maybe the corn tortilla is more sturdy? These flour ones were doubled up as well. The enchiladas were very good, just not as much flavor in the mole or salsa verde sauce as I was hoping for. Definitely 1,000 times better than Tako. Service was okay, the girl was friendly but she kind of blew me off when I needed her the most, for a 2nd Mexicoke."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican meals I've ever eaten. The mole sauce was delicious and the servers were very attentive. Too much food eaten to try dessert but they looked awesome. There homemade hot sauce was the best I had ever had.  I wish them many long years there as their food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great place to have tacos burritos anything you fancy it's just fantastic. This is now the traditional Tuesday night place for Taco Tuesday I can't wait till tonight it's obviously Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Barbacoa and Enchiladas here. My date and I were expecting this to be the type of Mexican restaurant that has 20 pages of items and sombreros everywhere but this is not that kind of place. We were surprised to find only four pages of options, but they were all the best traditional Mexican dishes.         The food was all perfectly seasoned and portions were great. Our queso dip starter was delicious and we watched one of the staff members make guacamole table side for a number of guests. If you enjoy traditional Mexican food you will love it here."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and so glad I did! Food is so authentic, fresh and delicious. The guacamole is better than homemade and all of our food was amazing! I can't remember the correct spelling of each dish but I had the seafood stew which was perfection!!!  Big portions, good prices and wonderful service. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't give many five stars but this is one of them!  Don't go here for a fancy night out, just go here for the best Mexican food you will ever eat in a quaint atmosphere and friendly owners!  BYOB also, no cork fee nonsense either!  Rick Bayless in Chicago eat your heart out!  Like MC Hammer says ole Rick. \"You can't touch this...!\"  Rick you need to lower your prices and stop traveling the world looking for the best mole dishes...$178 plane ticket to Pittsburgh is all the traveling you have to do to find the finest mole!   Best mole I ever ate!  Order the Steeler burrito and both of you can eat it!  Maybe all three of you!  Enchiladas are wonderful also.  My wife had the fajitas and they were special...much different than what you get at Chili's...real Mexican cooking!  This is true Mexican food...not Americanized Mexican...real deal authentic Mexican cuisine...  Grab a 6-pack of Modelo and go.  You won't be disappointed...unless you were looking for a fancy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We just ate here on Wednesday. The food is good. Server wasn't to sure about gluten free. I had to help. I told my husband I will get sick tonight lol. He didn't believe me.  The food is excellent! The flavor was amazing. I wish I could eat it again but I won't. I did get sick cross contamination. But if you do t have celiac I say go you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Extremely limited options. Only one hot sauce. Salsa was bland. Tamale was okay. Would not go here again or recommend it to anyone. Waste of time - went here after looking at the good reviews."}
{"text":"Went to the food truck. The tacos are inauthentic--why are they half rice?! I'd get a burrito if I wanted rice. Flavor of the vegetarian pepper taco is bad. I feel like I wasted my money and don't even want to eat this. The only good parts of my meal were the crispy tortillas and garlic sauce. My friend got the plantain empanada which was way better, so that is what bumped up my review from two to three stars."}
{"text":"The home made Mexican food in the sahside! Come on in and feel at home. They are very welcoming people!! Food? GREAT!!! Ask Me!!"}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food, La Palapa has the best most authentic Mexican food in town. You have to try it. We've been many times, tried all kinds of things and never had a bad meal.   They moved and are now next to Mallorca now. They painted and put lots of great Mexican artifacts and decor all over the walls and have Mexican stars hanging from the ceiling. It's magical.   We started with the chorizo appetizer and it was soooooo good.  I had the chicken, sausage and cheese enchiladas rancheras, which were good with rice (kind of dry) and pinto beans. Next time, I'd go back to my barbacoa, which is absolutely delicious. My husband had the pollo asado that he loved with the most delicious potatoes and veggies. We finished the night with the tequila cake, which was ok, but had WAY too much tequila. I love tres leches cake, but you couldn't taste the cake because all you could taste was tequila. I like tequila, but it was overkill.   The waitress was super sweet and extremely attentive. We didn't have to beg her for anything. The host was very welcoming too."}
{"text":"Oh my god - this place is so good! I got the veggie empanadas and chips & guac. Both were amazing.    So many great things:  Bright tasting & fresh guac.  Chips that I'm pretty sure are made in house.  The option to add in red or green sauce. The empanadas were fresh, full of veggies (I got the veg ones) and had a nice sauce on the side.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Make a reservation, or you might be asked to leave when the party with reservation arrives. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, with plenty of options for vegetarians. The service is great, and it's BYOB. Get the chiles rellenos!"}
{"text":"REALLY good, authentic Mexican food. Just wish they served margaritas!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Pittsburgh to get delicious Mexican food. It's small, the staff are super friendly and helpful (I somehow manage to get the same waiter every time - he's awesome!), and the guacamole really is the best in the burgh. For the meals you get, the portions and prices are perfect. They also have a fair amount of vegetarian options, and all their beef is sourced locally from Clarion Farms. So, if you're looking for a wholesome place to get Mexican food, definitely stop in here and forego the overly glorified places like steel cactus.   Also, I recommend the flautas; so good!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm picky about Mexican. If Taco Bell is Mexican to you, we wouldn't get along. La Palapa is authentic and always so fresh. It's one of my favorite places in the South Side. I would definitely recommend it. And try the Queso- it's delicious!"}
{"text":"A nice cozy restaurant, La Palapa will take your taste buds on a journey to Mexican flavor town.  They have plenty of quality options, and you cannot go wrong with anything.  If you don't know what to pick, they have a great sampler option to give you a taste of everything.  If you're looking for Mexican cuisine, this is a great stop."}
{"text":"Really good place. I have been coming here weekly for a few weeks with my friend after we run. The service is very good a prompt and everything we had has always been delicious.   We always order the guacamole and chips to start. The guacamole is delicious and rivals my favorite Pittsburgh guac, mad mex. The chips are clearly freshly made and deep fried, so they are a bit oily. I usually prefer less oily chips but these ones are good.   I have had the tacos and quesadillas, which are both very tasty. The chorizo is awesome and has some spiced potatoes mixed in, which I've never had before but really enjoyed.   On Tuesdays they have a special of 3 tacos for $7, which is basically like getting one for free. Even when they aren't running a special, it's very affordable for the portions you get.    Overall, very good. I'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"Good mexican food. Nice place."}
{"text":"Honest to god the best mexican food I've ever had. The chips and salsa (pico) were well worth the extra charge - the chips were clearly freshly made as was the salsa. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was perfection. Guac was great. Fresh pineapple juice was so good. Rice and beans were flavorful and great size. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to La Palapa twice, an intimate and unassuming little place that serves the most exquisite Mexican food that will ever grace your day. From the home made chips and salsa through the taco and burrito plates, I doubt you will find such tasty and authentic food anywhere in Pixburgh. An additional treat is the fresh fruit beverage concocted everyday, at least in the summer. If you are served by Alberto, you are in good hands. I would think that the great dining here would could only be matched by being a guest at a dinner at a friend's home in Juarez or Tijuana. It's that authentic and that good. In fact, stop reading now and head on to the SousSide for the fish tacos or the potato flautas. Thank  me later."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh - which by the way is a rarity. Finding legit Mexican fare in Pittsburgh is hard as it is so this place really fills in that void.  My go-to favorites are the tortilla soup (hearty soup with tortilla), chicken and beef nachos (i do not even like nachos but La Palapa has such awesome nachos that even im sold; loaded with veggies, beans, cheese and meat along with red mole and green verde sauce). I highly recommend their nachos! Another favorite of mine are their empanadas especially the shrimp empanada. The beef empanada is good also but the shrimp one is my favorite.  Dont forget to get a pineapple or lime Jarritos with your meal. I do miss the older location when La Palapa was a hole in the wall but im happy for their success and hope the food quality and taste stays the same."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This is going to be my go-to Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. My boyfriend got the flautas (barbacoa, chicken and potato) and they were perfectly crispy and full of flavor. I got the bandeja paisa special...amazing. I hope they keep serving this. It came w/ rice, beans, ground beef, chorizo, ?pork belly, fried egg, arepa, avocado and plaintains."}
{"text":"I'll be brief: best Mexican in Pittsburgh. Almost gave up on the burgh. Great, great service. Excellent price and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place after reading reviews but I was severely let down. It took almost ten minutes to be greeted by our waiter, who did not come over until I had to wave him down. Chips and cheese came and the cheese was thin and cold. Enchiladas came cold and without the steak as advertised. Had to wave for the waiter again to bring the steak which came cold to no surprise. A gray piece of shoe leather in which I wish didn't come at all. Never again. Worst experience at a restaurant in years."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time! I finally got in there yesterday night and I'm already itching to go back.  It was a Sunday around 7:30 and the place was about half full. My friend and I were both first-timers, so we decided to sample a few appetizers together. We shared a pineapple tamal with the green sauce that was delicious. In retrospect I think I would have liked something with cheese better (bean and cheese/ spinach and cheese were two options of the day that I wished I had gone with), but the green sauce with the tamal was fantastic. I can't wait to try their different varieties in the future. At $4.95, I expect I'll order the tamal appetizer every time I come here.   We also shared the chile relleno appetizer, which was good but not too exciting. We got it with half green half mole sauce to try both. Their mole sauce is delicious and has a lot of depth of flavor, but the peppers themselves were underwhelming and there wasn't enough cheese for my taste. We still ate all. of it. I also got a mushroom taco, which sounds a bit strange but was actually delicious. My friend got the barbacoa taco and loved it. $3.25 is a great price for tacos.   The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the chips and salsa. I'm finally over the fact that you can't get complimentary chips and salsa at any Mexican place in the city limits (unlike most places I have been to outside the city), but when I pay for an item that many places are giving away for free, I expect to get a decent portion. Although it's only about $3, the portion of salsa they give you is really disappointing. It's a tiny little bowl that I think should actually qualify as more of a ramekin. No big deal overall though, just a lesson learned. Pictures on here seem to indicate that cheese and guac come in more appropriately sized bowls. I guess it's just the salsa.   Overall I loved it and I can't wait to go back and try something else. I actually wanted to go right back today, but they are closed on Mondays! bummer."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  It's a tiny shop on East Carson in Southside and you can easily forget you're in the heart of the hustle and bustle down there.  It's a perfect place to meet with friends or for a date.  Once, they had a three piece band play live music.  The price is reasonable and the food is excellent.  I have been to La Palapa on a few occasions and I find the service is always excellent as well.  The servers are always willing to answer any questions I have and never seem impatient if you bring a large group.  I've tried a lot of different items on the menu but I liked the Chorizos Espanol I had on Friday evening.  I'll be going back, they've got a regular in me!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Mexican food! Love eating here any time we are in town. The tamales are to die for."}
{"text":"I was really happy with the enchiladas. I was torn between a few of the things on the menu which sounded equally good. The location is great for walking around to aid in the digestion of your meal afterwards."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to La Palapa time and time again because of their amazing customer service, BYOB policy, and outstanding authentic Mexican food. My favorites are the ribs (which pretty much fall off the bone), tacos, and quesadillas. I love both the chicken and the beef tongue. If you want to try a good mix of menu items, get the sampler.  ALSO (this is super important) on Taco Tuesday you get three of their amazing tacos for $7.  Jesus and his staff are so great and welcoming. Last time I was in, the agua fresca of the week was horchata. If that is ever an option, GET IT. Sweet cinnamon deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I went here for some authentic Mexican food and definitely got it. This looks like a hole in the wall type place. byob which is good for the drinkers!   The service was not great. The person who served and took my order could not speak English and was so confused when I placed my order. Then gave me the wrong side.   The food was good but nothing to go crazy about for me. I got a tamale and I enjoyed it! It's just that I am not craving to go back like I usually am.   Recommend for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican style food in Pittsburgh! It's small inside, and gets busy during prime eating times so watch out. I'd recommend the chicken mole poblano, as well as the enchiladas verdes, but prefer the beans option over the vegetables. The guacamole is good, and the agua fresca is refreshing.  La Palapa is a bike friendly business, and they had no problem with us dragging our huge jogging stroller in when they weren't busy and had room to park it. They have nice baby changing tables in the restroom."}
{"text":"I had endless options for happy hour dinner along East Carson Street.  After narrowing it down to two choices, I started reading yelp reviews.  I decided that the place with better reviews would be it.  Except they both had good reviews, mostly from my fellow elites.  I ultimately decided on La Palapa because it was Tuesday and I needed tacos.  Yes, this was the right decision.  My server Shawna was friendly and helpful and just made the whole meal even better.  The Tuesday special is 3 tacos for $7.50 and you can mix it up (i.e. you don't have to get 3 of the same kind).  They have lots of taco options, too, including fish and vegetarian.  I went with one chicken, one barbacoa and one beef tongue.  I also ordered a Tecate for happy hour ($1 off).  My plate of tacos was a beautiful presentation that I almost didn't want to eat.  But don't worry, I did.  And I foolishly thought I might even take a taco home.  Nope, didn't happen.    And not that I needed it, but something sweet sounded really good.  Especially when Shawna mentioned a tequila cake they had available for dessert.  It totally hit that sweet spot and was the perfect ending to my meal.   Reasonable prices for amazing food in a bright and open space makes La Palapa one of the few places in the South Side that I will make a point of returning to."}
{"text":"Man....I was so excited to try this place two weekends ago and we never actually made it until this past Saturday night.  I think I had much different expectations about this little spot in SouthSide.  I give 3 stars for the great service and the OK food.  First - the location & atmosphere:  It is small and on 19th street. Parking was easy to find and when we walked in Bobby had mentioned it used to be an old Thai place.  The décor wasn't anything fancy- It was small and very casual.  There was a large group of maybe 8-10 people next to us using most of the tables, then maybe two other couples.  We grabbed a seat by the window.  I think this place would be better as a lunch spot rather than a Saturday night BYOB dinner spot.  The service: We had three people waiting on us. One took our drink orders and opened our wine/brought out the glasses.  A woman was taking our orders and was a server in training and had someone showing her the ropes.  Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. They took good care of us without being overbearing or annoying which I always appreciate.  Finally, the food:  We ordered chips and pico plus guac.  The pico, per our server's suggestion, was very good.  The guac was good but lacked a little flavor (garlic? lime? salt? I don't know).  The chips were fresh and not greasy but they literally broke into a million pieces every time you took a bite! I made a mess of course.  Bobby ordered the seafood stew as his dinner and said he very much enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavors and a lot of different types of seafood.  I ordered their special - the chicken sopes.  The chicken and toppings seemed fresh but pretty bland.  The base was dry and didn't have much flavor.    I would go back and try this place again and then hopefully update the rating/review.  Bobby really enjoyed his and would give it 4 stars he said, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I'm very very particular about my tacos. I grew up in TX and absolutely love Mexican food. Pittsburgh has numerous great \"trendy\" taco places, but this is not that. La Palapa is the closest thing to authentic Mexican food I've come across in my six years in this city. It's no nonsense delicious food.   Like the food, the restaurant is simple and no frills. It has pretty basic decor and is actually quite small. The service is excellent and the food comes out in a timely fashion. It's also BYOB- I highly recommend their margarita mix."}
{"text":"I had the enchiladas verdes for lunch today.  All the food at the table smelled incredible and it was very delicious.  Most of the tables were empty when we got there . The service was prompt and friendly and they had no problem splitting our checks (we asked before ordering).  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"After they did such a spectacular job at the south side soup festival with a pear squash soup, we had to try them out.  Going there on a Sunday for lunch, there were a few other tables of people, but it wasn't super busy.  I ordered the tamales - chicken - which came with the best rice and beans I have ever had.  I am not sure what the spice was, but it was outstanding - flavorful and complex.  The dish arrived with two tamales - one with a mole sauce that had the perfect amount of heat and traditional mole taste and one with a green sauce that might have been my favorite - tomatillo and garlic and delicious.   My daughter liked the salsa so much she drank the cup - I'm not kidding and apologize to any of you that happened to be in there while she was doing it.   Z got the tortilla soup which was served with an egg.  I'd never had it with an egg, but it was better for it.  They should do a ton more soups because they are amazing.  He also got barbacoa which was fantastic - like Chipotle's but actually authentic tasting.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I first experienced La Palapa in small quantities at a couple yelp events in Pittsburgh Public Market- I was super excited to check out this adorable little restaurant and try some full size options!  My sister and I visited on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00- there were a few parties in the small restaurant, allowing us to have plenty of options on where to sit. We chose a cozy little table next to a window, so we could people watch (who doesn't love that?!). First off, our server was ADORABLE. He was super helpful, in a great mood and just made the experience that much better by his wonderful attitude.   I was curious about the horchata, so he let my sister and I sample it before making up our minds. After trying one sip, I knew I had to order it- it was amazing! Really refreshing. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a beef taco, my sister ordered one chicken and one cheese quesadilla. I was given two tacos- one chicken and one beef. Not a big deal.   The tacos were HUGE. PACKED with meat and served with guacamole, lettuce and salsa. The chicken was awesome- it was shredded, juicy and full of flavor. The guac was amazing and so was the salsa! Our server asked if we wanted hot sauce, and of course we did. WOW. It was a home made green sauce and full of flavor. It added a really tasty kick to the tacos. My sister loved her quesadillas and loved the hot sauce with them as well. I wasn't so crazy about the beef taco- the meat just was a little flavorless to me and it was almost too much meat. I couldn't finish it at all.  The horchata went PERFECTLY with the tacos. The creaminess of the horchata really cooled my mouth down, which was awesome.   You can't beat the prices of this place- the quesadillas and tacos are a little over $3 each.. making them a steal! I have been to tons of taco places in which I needed four to feel full. One and a half tacos from La Palapa and I was STUFFED.  Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Texas two years ago and for so long I thought I'd never find good Mexican food in Pittsburgh! I tried so many terrible places until I found La Palapa, this place is the REAL DEAL!! The food is delicious and authentic, everyone should go here! Get anything with mole sauce on it, their mole sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the very high ratings, this does not meet my expectations of a 4.5 star place. It was fine, the owners are nice, the space is just okay. It's in the old Thai Me Up space. My tacos were over-filled and my husband's enchiladas had that disappointing nuked quality...steamed to death and not a consistent temperature throughout. It's cheap and fine for a quick place, but if you are looking for a nice night out with 4.5 star quality food look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I had the sops de Pescado. This was great. My main course was an appetizer of shrimp squid and mussels. Fantastic! We will be back. Also we have a party of 20-25 and they do Catering!"}
{"text":"This place serves the BEST TACOS I have ever had. MUST get the beef tongue taco. Staff is incredibly nice and polite and the restaurant is very authentic and simple. The know what they're doing and they do it great. I honestly cannot wait to go back. It's great for any meal or occasion, whether you want to grab something to go and walk around the south side and eat it or sit down for a meal.   *PS, while the tacos blew my mind, the other food is easily on equal footing and is delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, and a very authentic taste. I would highly recommend the steak tacos and the black and gold burrito"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Mexican cuisine. I absolutely love this place. It's small and cozy inside, with colorful and fun decorations. The food is AMAZING - fresh and full of flavor. They have a wide variety of options and often have great and affordable lunch specials. I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious. The frijoles charros and the tamales are two of my favorites. My husband loves the Burrito Steelers. The menu has something for everyone. Definitely recommend their house hot sauce if you like your food spicy. You have to try the horchata - it's refreshing and just sweet enough that it complements the food perfectly. Thank you to the La Palapa team!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place today after decided to eat elsewhere - our other restaurant choice had a 45 minute wait time. We started with the special soup of the day - poblano corn soup. It was amazing! Highly recommends. Such a heart soup that tasted homemade. Could not have been better. For mains, my boyfriend had the Pollo Asado with rice and beans. The chicken was cooked excellently - nice and moist, and he enjoyed his meal, but the taste of the sauce was not to my liking. It is mild and has a chocolate base - if you want it spicy, you need to add hot sauce on the side. I had the bbq pork quesadilla and the Barbacoa steak quesadilla with flour tortillas - both were excellent, although I did like the bbq pork one better - it was tastier because of the sauce. Both quesadillas were served with a small side of guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. We wanted to try their hot chocolate, but were too full! The table next to us couldn't stop raving about it.   It's a small, but extremely cosy place. I loved the ambience. Good music, good service. A definite must try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend and I have been waiting for a good, not too expensive Spanish restaurant and here came La Palapa. First off we ordered chicken nachos, proved to be phenomenal. Fresh/homemade nachos, pulled chicken, guacamole, and all other things delicious. Surprised us we just expected regular ol nachos. Then we both ordered from the churrasco section and were blow away. I got tbone with rice and sweet potato fries. The tbone was seasoned pretty darn good and cooked to order and I never knew sweet potato fries could be so amazing from a Mexican place. The chicken seasoning made my boyfriend surrender to deliciousness, he put his fork down and said \"im done. This is too good\". Ended it all with a nice coffee. Not one complaint! Except they didn't give us Ice with the water which i thought was weird, but I'm sure they would have gave me some if I asked. Also BYOB nice touch always. The owner and staff were also a pleasant part of the whole thing, so friendly and personable. Will be going back.... Quite often."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch on cinco de Mayo this year. We  obviously had to get our Mexican fix and I wasn't disappointed. It was a great day and we got a nice table at their covered outdoor area. The margaritas on special were good.. came in a plastic cup though. The guac is made right at your table. Some find that really cool, I find it gimmicky. The guac is nothing fancy, just your regular guac ingredients, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapeños and lime but yummy! I also ordered the veggie stuffed peppers and a veggie empanada both of which were excellent. The stuffed pepper appetizer is highly recommended! We ended with their tequila cake which is a tequila infused tres leche. It tasted like a regular tres leche with no sign of any tequila infusion but tasty nevertheless! For vegetarians especially, La Palapa is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city and I'll definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"I am super sad that it took me so long to try La Palapa.  My hubby and I were in the mood for tacos so we decided to venture out in the beautiful weather.  The lunch special was 2 tacos, veggie soup, 2 sides and Horchata for $13.  So much food!!! We also got chips and green salsa.  Best green salsa in the city.  For my tacos I had the chorizo & potato and the barbacoa.  Everything had just the right spice and salt.  I cannot say enough good things.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in Pittsburgh! The entrees are great for two reasons, the meat quality and preparation is top notch AND the sides are equally worth talking about. Beans and rice were phenomenal in comparison to the other Mexican places in the Burgh. The chiles rellenos con queso y espinaca, chicken nachos, chorizo enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and barbacoa flautas were all 10/10 delicious.   Pro tip- ask for the spicy homemade hot sauce. Not to spicy, perfectly flavored with peppers.  The coconut flan and the fried banana dessert were worth coming back for alone. It was totally affordable for the four of us (with 4 dinners, apps, and desserts: under 70 bucks).  Service is great- it's an authentic Mexican restaurant and the staff clearly cares about their food and your experience eating it. Loved it."}
{"text":"Really cute hole in the wall Mexican place. Service is friendly. If you like Emiliano's give this a try too!"}
{"text":"Delicious, huge portions, great value.  Slightly distracted service but very friendly nevertheless.  BYO so mix up your own margaritas - but they had Mexican Coke for our kids (they were very happy.)  Easy walk to some great dessert, too.  Great food."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best Mexican food we've had east of California and north of Mexico. Every single item was incredible."}
{"text":"I stopped in here because my wife and I wanted to get some mexican food and I will only go the authentic route anymore.   Good news this place is authentic, I will say it wasn't as amazing as I have had though and there is no Al Pastor. The tamal was pretty good and definitely a good size but the tacos really weren't anything to write home about. The chorizo seemed to be devoid of any flavor save some burnt taste. I'd even go to the point of saying it's the worst chorizo I've had and the rice I ordered on the side wasn't even cooked through.   The service wasn't too bad. There was one girl running the joint while another guy was standing behind the counter watching TV. He was happy to get feedback and see that people were happy but did nothing else as the girl who was somewhat timid was busting around trying to get things done.   Bad chorizo, no pastor, I'm probably out on this place."}
{"text":"Great addition to the southside. The tamales are authentic, the tacos (chorizo) are unexpectedly memorable, and both the green and mole enchiladas are flavorful (and I appreciated them not being drenched in cheese- they didn't need it!). Service is friendly if slow.  Among the best Mexican in the city!"}
{"text":"Food and salsa were all let downs.  The place echos with loud noise   It's a tiny place with harsh lighting.  Go to Taco Bell and be happier  We brought our own tequila and bought their sour mixer . We didn't care for it, too much sugar and not enough limes ..then after bringing our own liquor and paying for mediocre sours mix, they were charging us $6 for a glass fee for 2 of us.  This is not a swanky place, they don't even have a liquor license ! After a bad and loud meal, this $6 was ridiculous.  The waitress stands over you to finalize the bill with an iPad . They have the tip percentages spelled out for you . A bit awkward."}
{"text":"If you like raw onions, this is the place.  But for me, it gets a big nope.   The service was decent enough and the new location in the old Ibiza space is pretty spacious, but the food really dragged the place down.    We started with the jalapeños rellenos.  The were served more like poppers - a half jalapeño open-faced, filled with cheese and topped with bacon bits.  Somehow with those ingredients, they were bland and not in any way spicy.   And not really what I would have pictured for a dish named rellenos.    On to the guacamole.  We don't like the fuss of tableside, so we just ordered the 8 oz side and some chips.  The chips were a bit stale.  The guac had a ton of uneven chunks of white onion in it.  Big, small, and in between.   So many that I couldn't even work around it.  I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a guacamole.    Next was the tacos.  I got three.  They all had ample meat filling, but little else.  If there was sour cream, I couldn't find it on any of them.  The barbacoa was good, albeit a little boring.   The chorizo and potatoes was inedible- sopping wet with grease soaked through a double tortilla.  The steak and onions was very chewy and came with more raw, not cooked, onion.   All three were then topped with pico de gallo, which again was primarily raw white onion.     Overall, I enjoyed none of it.  And that's a shame because I really love authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! Great atmosphere in the Southside restaurant, and there's also a street cart that sells food downtown when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience everything from the atmosphere,food and delightful people to serve you! The owner even came over  to say hello and asked if we enjoyed our dinner!  We had a table of 12 and everything was served in a timely manner! I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for very authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great mexican food; cheap and delicious. Great food and drinks, but a small place. Not the best atmosphere and nothing fancy, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My friend and I recently found this place and I keep finding myself looking for excuses to come back. I'm a vegetarian, but both their potato floutas and veggie tacos are delicious! I also love their guacamole and chips. The service can be a little spotty (everyone's always super nice - just a few times our server has seemed a little inexperienced) - but the food is consistently delicious, inexpensive, and fast. I also love that it's BYOB. It's some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Burgh."}
{"text":"OMG this place is a hidden gem!! The most delicious chicken quesadillas ever!!! And the fish soup is the best I've ever had! The only rice they offer is white rice which sucks but everything else was so good it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Guacamole - RULES. Best I've ever had. Empanada appetizer w ground beef - DELICIOUS!!! We shared a sampler platter for 2, which was delicious. The flautas rule! Chicken Mole wasn't the best I've ever had, but the meal was on the best Mexican I've ever had.  Service was very friendly and prompt and genuinely nice.  We will def be back BYOB - there's a package store down the street. Grab some Corona and bring it with you!"}
{"text":"Their tamales are very good and the chips are amazing. The cheese dip and guacamole portions are rather small. I guess that would be my only issue with my experience. Other than that, wonderful food :)"}
{"text":"Great little food truck, usually set up on the corner of Penn Avenue, across the street from the Benedum.  They have tacos & empanadas ($3.50 each) and usually a special of the day. I've had their tacos and empanadas on several occasions and they are quite delicious. The empanads have a crispy, flaky crust that is cooked perfectly. My friend tried the special one day which was a sausage and fried plantains...she loved it. They also have mexican coke, which I love!  I've always been too full to try their dessert options, but I bet they're good too!"}
{"text":"Best soup around. Not a bad choice on the entire menu. The addition of a bar is a nice bonus to this restaurant. Be sure to look at the original artwork that decorates this new location."}
{"text":"I have been searching for authentic Mexican since I moved to Pittsburgh a year ago. La Palapa definitely delivers on many levels.   Atmosphere - great music and color decor! You walk in from Carson street and immediately transported into Mexico   Service - prompt, attentive, and ensures your table has everything you need.   Food - DELICIOUS. I came for brunch and we had  Spinach Tomato Tamales, with tender rice, and flavorful pinto beans. The green sauce is tangy and full of layered roasted yumminess. My favorite is the bottle of \"spicy\" sauce the waiter brought us, it adds a really good kick!   I had the chicken chilaquiles with green sauce. It comes with lots of refried beans, chips, and fresh onions/cilantro. Also very good.   My FAVORITE though was a broth based tortilla soup. The chips were crunchy in the deep bodied hot soup. There were sweet tomatoes, onion, big chunks of garlic, and lots of cilantro. My favorite part was the poached egg. I've had a lot of tortilla soup (usually tomato based) so this was a new take that I haven't had before.   Overall an excellent experience and I recommend to anyone looking for something different."}
{"text":"Hands down the best \"basic\" taco I've had in Pittsburgh. I got steak, barbacoa, and ground beef and they were all amazing. Less snazzy than the tacos you might get at Tako or SMOKE, but honestly I would prefer these tacos. Even better than Las Palmas, my other favorite in the burgh. They also had awesome guacamole, and our server was very nice and attentive. My family tried the vegetarian fajitas, flautas, and tilapia and there were rave reviews all around. It is a small place and it is BYOB. They have a margarita mix pitcher if you want to bring your own tequila (wish I knew this before hand!!)."}
{"text":"Friday was my first experience dining in with La Palapa. They recently moved closer to my house and i was excited to finally try it out. I had walked past their previous location but it was tiny and for whatever reason i never stopped by. I had their items at yelp events though.  This location to adorable. It has cute art on the wall, high ceilings and tall windows which showcase the Birmingham Bridge. It might not seem like an extravagant view, but it's a lot more interesting than just seeing people walk down the street ya know?  We were stumped on what to order. Everything seemed good! Initially i almost got the enchiladas Verde but my husband went to order it instead... Which meant we needed more time. Finally we decided on getting their sampler platter called Charola para Dos. Its $28.95 and a Includes a tamal, quesadilla, flauta, pork rib, chicken with mole and a empanada. You can choose your meat or vegetarian option on all items.   We went with a quesadilla (not really a quesadilla.. Like a folded fried tortilla shell with meat). We chose steak. It was good-- steak was flavorful.   For the empanada we chose beef and my goodness it was fabulous! Can't wait to order that as an appetizer itself next time.  For the flauta we chose chicken. I loved it! Super delicious!  Chicken with mole sauce was also great. Chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce went well with the rice served with the platter.  Pork rib was seasoned with Mexican spices and  sauce. Never had that on pork but wow it was great!   My least favorite item was the tamal. I personally felt like they could have chose some thing better... Like a taco or something. Maybe others find it tasty but it wasn't my thing to be honest.  We had the platter as our only dish but it filled us up. It could easily be an app for 3 people if everyone else was getting other food.  For dessert we went with the Sopapilla... fried tortillas with ice cream.. Loved it!  Service was great and even management stopped over to see how things were. He thanked us for our business and had small talk with us.. Super kind and humble guy.   Now, the downside. Ok in my personal opinion I find the drinks smaller, weak and overpriced. There was a special on margaritas for 7.95 i believe. (Normally $9 or $10) we each ordered 2. In comparison to other nearby places They were served in pretty small glasses and weren't strong in my opinion. At normally $10 i couldn't chill at the bar & have multiple margs with the girls. I do want to note that the margaritas were delicious, just weak.   Despite that i loved our experience here... Good food, service, management, cute inside, patio seating beginning soon and a cool bar. Im thankful we live so close. I'll be back for empanadas and to try the chicken mole and pork ribs as entrees"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fresh food and friendly faces. This place is a great find for authentic Mexican. Everything made in house! Like how rare is that now? Totally going back!"}
{"text":"La Palapa is the quintessential example of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant: a hole-in-the-wall with great food.  I visited last Sat. with a couple of friends after seeing a movie at the South Side Works cinema.  I tried a sample of the tamales at the Yelp Burgh Bash, and since then, had been wanting to try this place out, so the movie afforded a great opportunity for a visit.  Between three of us, we ordered the platter (\"charola\") para dos and an a la carte entree order of tamales.  The platter comes with the following items: taco, quesadilla, empanada, tamale, flauta, chicken, and ribs, plus rice and veggies.  In addition, I believe we were given an extra quesadilla.  We ordered a variety of different meats, including chicken, pork, and chorizo, as well as beans/peppers for the fillings.  Because there were so many different items, it's hard for me to remember the details, but most of them were very well-executed and delicious, with the standout being the tamales.  The only items we found lacking a bit were the taco (the chorizo's flavor was a bit off) and the empanada, whose filling I found a bit too liquidy, and my one friend found a bit too piquant.  One minor disappointment was that they were out of agua fresca (pineapple that day) and horchata by the time that we visited (around 8pm).  Since we hadn't brought any booze, we ordered Jarritos soda instead (lime for me, and orange and pineapple for my friends), which was good, but likely not as good as the freshly-made bebidas.  The ambiance in this place is exactly what I look for in a good hole-in-the-wall eatery, complete with interesting and culturally-appropriate decorations, music, and friendly service.  Given the hour at which we visited, the dining room was only 1/3-1/2 full, with one party of somewhat boisterous middle-aged women who'd taken advantage of the BYOB policy to the fullest comprising most of the diners.  Their fun didn't detract from ours, though, since they were pretty well-behaved, although it did make things more interesting--one of them bade us a rather obsequious goodbye on the way out.  We felt that the portions were generous and the prices were inexpensive.  In sum, if you're hungry for a quality and authentic Mexican meal at a good value in the South Side, check La Palapa out!  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very bland .. The quesadillas were awful, they consisted of shredded chicken with no flavor and that's it. The guacamole was definitely missing something, hardly any flavor. The chips were soaked in grease and messy, however the 4 cheese dip was ok. If you're looking for authentic, flavorful Mexican save your time and go to Cocina Mendoza in the south hills."}
{"text":"Holy portions! If you want some serious bang for your buck, stop at La Palapa on E. Carson St. on the South Side.  Just to be clear, this review is on a to-go order that my loving husband picked up on his way home from work..  So, back to why we are here, the food.. we ordered the chips and salsa, the black and gold burrito, and one of each kind of taco: shredded chicken, pork, chorizo, and steak. In my (self-proclaimed) professional taco opinion, I rank them: 1. Steak 2. Pork 3. Chorizo and 4. Chicken. Each taco came with a doubled up corn shell, sprinkled with a bit of rice, topped with cheese, cream, and the pico. Each taco was PACKED with the protein. The steak was grilled and tasty, the pork was shredded and juicy, the chorizo was a bit greasy but very tasty, and the chicken was tasty but a little on the dry side.  As far as that monstrous burrito?? We (2 grown adults with hearty appetites) were so full after the chips & tacos that all we could do was cut it open, try a little sliver, and pack the rest up for lunch (for both of us) tomorrow.  So why 4 stars? The onions from the tacos/pico definitely linger & that's not my favorite thing in life. The chorizo was greasy.. like saturated the bottom of all the rest of the taco shells greasy. So maybe if you order the chorizo taco to-go, ask to have it wrapped separately. And finally, the chicken was dry.   Overall.. I'll be back. I was satisfied with that the flavors and the portions and now I want to try those margaritas!  Update: Make your way to their new spot on East Carson. The decor is interesting and the owner was very proud of the art and the patio. The food was delicious and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Authentic? Yes. (My waiters name was Jesus. Not run by white people pretending to make good Mexican dishes)   Hole in the wall atmosphere? Check.  Did our food take long to prepare? Nope.   This is one of those places you feel bad about. We went on a Sunday night around 7PM and it was empty. The staff bought pizza from another shop for dinner.  Apparently they must've been bored eating the same thing every night.   Food was good. We got chips and salsa and guacamole. Salsa was warm and the chips were salty. The guac was fresh.   My lady got their barbacoa which was rather tasty. The beans and rice were a nice side.   I got the half chicken and rice and potatoes. I would've given this place 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that my chicken was cold and they needed to bring it back to the kitchen to reheat it which dried the meat out. Looks like they cook everything in the morning and then just reheat it which kind of ruins the authenticity.   It is BYOB with a $3 corking charge. Which is cool. And they have soda with real sugar in it which is a nice touch.   Overall would I come back? Probably not. Mad mex has that market on lock and Chipotle is the way to go for fast food. But it is a nice little local joint."}
{"text":"The lengua was a dish in its own category, unlike anything else they make here. Thinly sliced, very tender, and covered in a thin layer of green chili sauce--you'd be hard pressed to find a similar item anywhere else. It's definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"The authenticity of the joint appeals to me, and it also comes through in the amazing food. I had the barbacoa last time. Could've eaten two more plates of that. Their guac is a little lemony for me, but good.  I prefer - er, love - their warm verde sauce. I seriously haven't had a bad meal here yet, and the place reminds me of the joints I've visited in the side streets of of Mexico."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing Mexican food at the heart of Southside.  This city definitely lacks authentic Mexican restaurants, and having seen reviews of La Palapa as well as tasted some of their items at the Yelp Halloween event, we decided to give this a try. I was thrilled to know they have Mexican flavored soda (Jarritos). I got a order of guacamole with chips as an appetizer. My only complaint is that the chips were really oily!  But the guac was fresh and extremely flavorful. Then I got the enchiladas with green sauce for the entree. Oh man, I was so impressed! I absolutely loved the green sauce, which tasted so delicious and mildly spicy. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I really enjoyed this dish! The waitress was friendly and genuine! The place is BYOB, but there aren't a dearth of bars just around the corner. Overall enjoyed the experience and would go there again."}
{"text":"Went to La Palapa this past weekend for lunch and was really satisfied. It's a small restaurant but it wasn't very crowded. I'm sure weekend dinners can get busy. I ordered the sopa de tortilla and the enchiladas verdes with chicken. The soup was full of flavor and had a nice kick. The enchiladas were also delicious, and the accompanying rice and beans were solid. The enchiladas were topped with plenty of sauce and cheese and the portion was very generous. All of the food tasted freshly made with quality ingredients.  I'll definitely be going back to La Palapa whenever I'm in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"We love Mexican food & visited La Palapa for the first time the other night. So good!! Prices were reasonable, and it's BYOB. My husband says the beef tongue tacos are worth trying."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour on a Friday and it was very dead- I thought it would be a little more crowded with customers but the staff was lively and friendly and our food came out quickly so can't complain!   We stared with the beef empanada which was tasty. Came with half the verde sauce and half the mole sauce on top, and while tasty, I wish would have been on the side because it took away from the soft crunch I was looking for in the empanada pastry.   I ordered four tacos- bistec, rajas, barbacoa, and chorizo. To my surprise, the rajas packed the most flavor but all were very well done. The tacos were double layered (I guess this is authentic Mexican style? I approve!) with corn tortillas, a scoop of rice, cilantro, and salsa.    My girlfriend got the enchiladas in the verde sauce. This came with rice and a zucchini/ squash medley. The enchiladas seemed a bit on the small side. She got one chicken, one beef and one cheese. The most disappointing thing was that the chicken and beef ones didn't have any cheese on them at all! This made for a rather dry and flavor-lacking experience. Honestly, the cheese one was the best one.   We also had the house marg for $5 which was very good as well. Complimented the dishes nicely. I could see some people claiming it was on the weaker side, but I'm not a big tequila guy so it was fine to me!  Apparently they have a Taco Tuesday deal (three tacos for $7) which I'd totally come back for. Our waitress was great and the food does seem authentic, albeit could use work in some areas. Id be interested in tasting some of their other dishes too!"}
{"text":"Lunchtime on a Thursday afternoon; the restaurant is empty, and the waitress tells us to sit wherever we would like. She's immediately over with water and to inquire about appetizers - she was very attentive for the whole meal.  We got the chips and guac, which was good but definitely not the best I've had. The chips were a little too greasy, but still good.The guac was a good texture, but definitely could have had more flavor. For my entree, I had two tacos - one chorizo & potato, and one barbacoa. The barbacoa was really really good. The chorizo was alright - there was an interesting taste of cloves. Both were really full with rice and pico - sour cream & cheese optional. My tortillas fell apart before I even picked it up, but it was still tasty. My boyfriend had some pretty tasty tamales too. Only three stars because, although tasty and the service was good, the meal was not worth the $24 pre tip for lunch.  Definitely a bit overpriced. I probably won't be back just because there are so many other places that are just as good nearby that cost a lot less."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Their enchiladas are one of the best I've had. The service was pretty fast. Good portion size. All the ingredients tasted fresh and well cooked. BYOB but they have corkage. I would definitely visit again and recommend la palapa to anyone looking for Good Mexican food."}
{"text":"We used La Palapa to cater a networking event. Jesús was very great with responding to us in a timely manner. Additionally, they provided great care in setting up for our event. Most importantly, the food was delicious!! We ordered the tacos and quesadillas for 100 people. It did not disappoint. All our guests raved about it, some even asking where we catered from.  I would really love to come into the restaurant and enjoy the food again!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend anyone to go to this restaurant. The food was cold and it smells like poisoned food."}
{"text":"The place is barely alright. We had chips and 4 cheese dip as appetizer. Not good. Chips were bland and oily. Dip was soggy and it did not taste like cheese. Then we had a burrito steeler, tasted good. However, for the price, it should have grilled beef instead of ground beef, and no cilantro?! Really??!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I bought some take out for dinner and wow was it tasty. I had the torta and he got two tacos and a quesadilla. All of the food was ready when they said it would be and was really reasonably priced for the amount and quality. We'll definitely go back for seconds!"}
{"text":"It's all about the barbacoa dish here! I think it's the best one on the menu. The Mole dish could've been better."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything tasted incredible. The waitress was a sweetheart, I didn't get her name but I remember she mentioned she was 17 but far more mature for her age. She was very attentive and offered great suggestions.   The chicken nachos were delicious, possibly the best I've ever had. A bold statement, but my boyfriend agreed. We split the sampler dish and loved it all. Generous portions, we both left stuffed and took home the remaining food. I highly recommend and I'm already looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Finally found good Mexican food in Pittsburgh!! This place is amazing. The barbacoa taco as an appetizer was perfect. The tamales we're excellent as well. Very friendly service too"}
{"text":"Food is authentic and the portions are huge! You will not leave unhappy literally I mean it!"}
{"text":"Awesomely awesome awesomeness. That is how I describe La Palapa restaurant in the southside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  This means that truly authentic Mexican food finally has arrived here in the southside. Forget all other places, go to this place immediately. They recently won the best vegetarian soup in the most recent soup contest in Pittsburgh...this made me order one of their soups. The Frijoles Charros was amazingly tasty and perfectly cooked. If you get nothing else, get this (it isn't vegetarian...the bacon says so).   For my main course, I ordered all of them, or just about. Trying to eat the Charola Para Dos! is tough. It's the sampler platter from the entrée section. Everything was great. Get it, but unlike me, you can share it with friends. The platter includes a tamal, quesadilla, flauta, one pork rib, chicken with mole, and one very extremely and most delicious empanada. I literally ate half of each one and I've taken the rest home for me to eat over the next day or two.   As a southsider, I will be back to this restaurant again and again and again and again and again..."}
{"text":"This is a nice little joint that fills in the gap that Southside desperately needed...non garbage Mexican food.  It's quite tasty, sometimes a little pricey, but generally it's worth your time. I've been here more than a few times at this point and I'd gladly go back. The lunch special is very economical.  I worry that their menu may need a tiny bit of trimming down, but perhaps I'm wrong. I just wish they gave out free salsa still :(  The dude behind the register has always been quite friendly as well.  GL dudes!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty pissed....  that I haven't been here sooner! I stopped by on a Tuesday evening and was meeting up with my family for dinner. So happy to hear that they had a taco Tuesday special! 3 tacos for $7. You can mix and match any tacos! I got one chicken, one bistec and one barbacoa. They were amazing! And they weren't skimpy little tacos either. They don't offer complimentary chips and salsa but get them! Both salsas are great! Will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"La Palapa is going to be my new Mexican local spot. I love the BYOB factor and the food is fresh and filling. It's authentic Mexican with a local twist. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Ate here last weekend with a few friends looking for some good (and somewhat authentic) Mexican food. Don't be fooled by the outward appearance, as it is a little intimidating from the outside. Their steelers burrito, mole, and tortilla soup is great, with reasonable price (about $11 for burrito or mole). My only complaint is that they charge you for chips and salsa ($3), which I thought was a bit of a rip off."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food in Pittsburgh! Great staff. Always friendly. Try their special when there, usually home made that day. Tamales are excellent. The tortilla soup is the best you have had. Family friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this last Thursday evening with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to a completely packed restaurant with no tables available.  Thankfully our friends were already there and had grabbed the last table for all of us.  La Palapa isn't a terribly large place and I would guess that it can seat about 30 people or so in the dining room.  This means that it can get very loud in there especially whenever there are larger groups at some of the tables as there was on this Thursday. It is decorated with photos on the walls from what I imagine to be Mexico.  Our group decided to start off the night by splitting both the chips and queso as well as the chips and guacamole for our appetizers.  The chips seemed to be freshly made but were pretty oily and seemed to lack some seasoning.  They were crunchy though and tasted good in both of the dips, each of which was creamy and delicious in its own way.   For my entree I decided on the enchiladas nortenas which consisted of 3 chicken enchiladas in a red sauce, a 6 oz steak and then the rice and pinto beans that comes with each entree.  I also ended up ordering a barbacoa quesadilla as a side dish to my meal.  All of the parts of my entree were decent with my favorite parts being the steak and the quesadilla.  While the steak seemed to have only been cooked on one side (pink until half on one side, well done on the other), it was thin enough that it still tasted good and I liked that it seemed to have the texture of the skirt steak.  What I liked about the quesadilla was the perfectly crispy shell and the flavor of the meat.  At $3.50, this may have been the best value of the evening for me.  Last but not least, even though we were all stuffed from having eaten our meals, our table decided to finish our meal by splitting a sopapilla.  While it wasn't like the sopapillas that I have had in Arizona, it was still good and seemed like a mash-up of churros and strawberry ice cream done right.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  This place is BYOB, reasonable priced and has some good food, so why not?"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. To start, atmosphere: one long seat against a wall with tables right next to eachother, so if you like privacy this isn't your place (not a knock, but I personally hate this seating arrangement), decor okay. Food: not gross, not good but just bland and just meh. The chips and salsa are $3.50 but worse than most free ones..the rice is plain white, beans straight from can, meat quality cheap, no flavor and nkt fresh taste, and cheese from a shake can taste and cheese in enchilada taste like string cheese.advertised as gormet Mexican..far from it. Way overpriced for quality..not sure how these reviews are all good."}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful surprise. (Thanks, Yelp!) If you've read any of my other reviews you know that yo quiero la comida mexicana. It will always have a standing reservation for prime real estate in my belly.  The waitress was so friendly, sweet, and helpful. We started off with some Mexican hot chocolate because it was colder than cold outside. It is not from a packet, but made on site and served in a pitcher that I want in my own personal collection. We got down to business and shared some guac and chips. For our main meal, we shared the flautas (2 barbacoa/2 chicken), which comes with rice, pinto beans or veggies. We substituted the rice for the veggies. Let me tell you... those were some of the most delicious veggies I've ever had. So well prepared and seasoned!  To supplement the flautas we ordered one pulled pork taco.  We couldn't finish all of it, so keep that in mind when you're making your choices. I was stuffed but got some churros to go because... duh. I had one before we went back into the cold and I was so glad that I did."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! It's a nice authentic Mexican restaurant. It isn't the biggest, but that's what I live about it. I was kinda bummed they don't give you free chips and salsa, but my table ordered some anyways.. Their pico was very tasty! Not one complaint from the crowd. I had the chicken tacos and they were awesome! We went on Tuesday so they had a special for tacos Tuesday, 3 tacos for $7!! I really wanted to get dessert but I was too full from the meal! I will definitely make another visit the next time I come to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Family was in town for a long July 4th weekend, and the six of us decided to check out La Palapa for the first time. From friends' rave reviews to the impressive Yelp rating, I had high expectations as I walked through the door! I was a bit unsure at first though -- the restaurant is definitely a dive, and the waitress seemed a bit stand-offish. However, my opinion quickly changed once the food and drinks arrived!  We started with nachos paired with guac and cheese dip and with margaritas. Make sure to buy your own bottle of tequila in advance to mix with their heavenly margarita mix - BYOT! Somehow, their flavorful margarita mix is both sweet and savory with a tasty splash of orange. Both dips were absolutely delicious. The guacamole was well-seasoned, while the cheese dip was rich and bowl-licking good.  My husband and I decided to share the Charola para Dos, which was a great idea, especially for your first time dining at this restaurant. The plate looked overwhelmingly large when it was delivered, but even after our dips and drinks, the two of us easily polished off most of the large plate. The plate included an empanada, tamal, quesadilla, flauta, pork rib, and chicken with mole. Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS! My personal favorite on the plate was the perfectly cooked pork rib - seriously, you've never had a pork rib this good - followed by the empanada.   I cannot wait to return to La Palapa, and I'm already dreaming of having their margarita mix and tasty food again very soon."}
{"text":"Food was great. Very accommodating to dairy free and vegan. I got tacos - and they were lovely. Guac was great as well."}
{"text":"Who would've thought that delicious authentic Mexican food could be found in a tiny little hole-in-the-wall joint in the Southside?  I've been wanting to go to this place since seeing some of the reviews on Yelp (thanks Yelpers!), and it did not disappoint. As mentioned, this is a hole-in-the-wall, but in the best possible way -- cute, cozy, unpretentious, and not dirty or outdated. It only has like 7 or 8 small tables, but it was not at all busy when our group of 4 went on a Sunday evening. We were the only non-Spanish-speaking customers in there at the time, which I was hoping was a good sign with regards to the food's authenticity.   Their menu is smaller than some of the other typical Mexican places around the 'Burgh that have, for example, 17 pages of Combos #1-100 to choose from. I think this is a good thing, because it means that they can focus on a few dishes and do them well. La Palapa's menu covers most of the Mexican basics -- tacos, tortas, tamales, quesadillas, flautas, burritos, enchiladas, etc., along with churrasco meats. Note that unlike at most other Mexican restaurants, you will not get free chips and salsa to start here. Maybe that speaks even more to the restaurant's authenticity...do they serve free chips and salsa at restaurants in Mexico? I've never been to Mexico, so I have no idea, but free chips and salsa totally sounds like an American thing to me. I digress...  I opted to get the mole poblano con pollo with pinto beans and vegetables (subbed for rice). It was simply delicious. You can tell that this food is fresh, homemade, and prepared with care. The chicken breast was succulent and so tender that it easily fell apart when cut with my fork. The mole sauce was slightly sweet and warmly spiced, although not hot spicy. They do have squeeze bottles of a very hot homemade green sauce (similar to the green sauce served at Chicken Latino) that you can add to your dish to kick up the spice intensity if you wish (which of course I did!)  The pinto beans that came as a side were very flavorful and well-seasoned, as were the vegetables (a mixture of fresh zucchini, squash, carrots and spinach).   My dining companions each ordered various items (tacos, enchiladas, tamales), and everyone was equally impressed with their food. I had a bite of my husband's poblano tamale and it was to die for. Also, their tacos are enormous! Along with the tamale, my husband got a chorizo taco and immediately had to knife-and-fork it because it was so big. One of our friends got a chicken taco and attempted to eat it the normal way, but had to give up because there was just so much filling. So they definitely don't skimp on the portion sizes here. Delicious food and a good value -- a rare combination these days!   Service was fantastic. We had the sweetest server who was very attentive in filling our waters, checking in to see how we liked the food, clearing our dishes, etc. It's also BYOB, which is awesome (although we did not take advantage of this -- next time!)  Seeing as La Palapa shines in service, food, and value, this will definitely be my new go-to spot for Mexican. Cheers amigos!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican place in Pittsburgh.  It's hard to come across Mexican food in Pittsburgh, and La Palapa does a great job of providing a moderate variety of everyone's favorite Mexican dishes.  To start off, their table side guac is awesome, is very fresh, and is just a nice show to have. They do the classic live avocado cutting and grinding, and mixing in all the ingredients. It's fun to watch and an absolute joy to eat.  For my main, I wasn't a big fan of the fajitas---there wasn't a whole lot of meat, and the tortillas were pretty bland. The seasoning was alright, I guess, but just because there was so much non meat items on the plate, it didn't really feel worth it.  I also ordered some tacos on the side, and they are definitely on the small side, but have a whole lot going on in a small bite, which is nice.  All in all, not a bad place to get Mexican food. I really loved the service by Jamie, and am excited to come back sometime!"}
{"text":"La Palapa offers incredible authentic Mexican food conveniently placed right on East Carson. Truthfully, I have driven past this place so many times without even knowing it was there. This place was recommended to me by a friend so I decided to check it out.  The place is BYOB, which I like a lot. The restaurant itself isn't very big but seems more than accommodating for larger parties. The atmosphere is bright with artwork on the walls.  Our server was attentive and helpful with any questions we had. She even put our bottle of wine in their freezer since it wouldn't fit into the chiller they provide.   The food was awesome! We started with chips and guacamole; the chips were fresh and crisp, the guac was light and full of flavor. I ordered the chicken flautas which were delicious. The portion was very generous and included rice and beans (or the option of rice and vegetables) that complimented the meal very well.   It seems like they do well with take out, two orders stopped in while we were there. The night we went it was snowing pretty bad out, there was only one party there besides us so I'm not sure how busy this place gets on a typical night.   All in all, I would most definitely go back and recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"My (new) favorite place for Taco Tuesdays.  Tacos are normally $3.50 per taco, which is pretty standard for Mexican food in the 'burgh. On Tuesdays however, IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS FOR THREE TACOS. How amazing is that?! You can also get three different types of tacos, which is always fun. I usually get chorizo and potato, pulled pork, and chicken.   The restaurant itself is small. It's cute in a very family owned way--it's not exactly modern, but it works because then the focus is on the food.   It's also BYOB, and they serve a non alcoholic margarita mixer. All you have to do is bring your own tequila--what's not to love??"}
{"text":"La Palapa is a small (BYOB, who knew?) Mexican restaurant located in the South Side of Pittsburgh. I was happy to find a Mexican restaurant located near where I was staying in Pittsburgh with such a high rating on Yelp however when I went to La Palapa for dinner on a Thursday night looking to score frozen margaritas and tasty enchiladas, I was surprised at how bland and flavorless the food was.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Platter for 2 for dinner and were disappointed in the lack of flavor and seasoning. The Platter for 2 features 1 Tamal, 1 small Quesadilla, 1 Taquito, 1 Empanada, 2 ribs, 1 Chicken breast with a bowl of white rice and a few slices of avocado. We ordered this platter as a great way to sample just about everything on the menu but we didn't really enjoy anything.   My boyfriend loves, I mean LOVES Mexican food and all of its glorious spices so he was really disappointed that La Palapa fell flat in all areas of Mexican cuisine. We were also informed that in Pittsburgh it is difficult for smaller establishments to obtain a liquor license.. but what is a Mexican restaurant without Margaritas and Piña Coladas!"}
{"text":"Some of the best taquitos I have had in Pittsburgh! The sauces are unique and delicious as well! The chips were freshly fried and mouth watering!"}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh! (Don't know what the other ones are.) The food is full of flavour. Delicious!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: Great flavor and many choices in toppings. A little bit pricey, but worth it. Get the Mexican hot chocolate!  The restaurant itself is quite small, but has a lot of business. However, it is easy to get a seat, and the servers are very polite. The menu is quite extensive, and you can have a lot of choices for types of meat.  I ordered the ground beef taco and a Mexican hot chocolate. The taco was rich and flavorful, with many toppings on it. It's definitely one of the most enjoyable tacos I've ever had. I especially enjoyed the taco shell - though it was soft, it was really crispy and warm. I really enjoyed the Mexican hot chocolate. It was sweet, but had a unique flavor that I hadn't tasted before in hot chocolate."}
{"text":"So good. Fresh ingredients with a perfectly balanced hot sauce.  A rare find on this coast."}
{"text":"Definitely a big meal within a tiny place. Best friend for hangover."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the rave reviews.  It's okay, but \"Best\" in Pittsburgh?  No way.  I ordered enchiladas -the chicken was dry and did not seem to have any seasoning whatsoever.  The verde could not overcome the blandness.  They were also not very hot (temperature).  When our food came out within 5 minutes, I guess it was obvious that the food had already been cooked and was reheated.  The quesadillas were dripping everywhere  (yes, yes, I know...\"authentic\") and left a lake of liquid all over the plate, not very pleasant to eat especially when they were just warm, but my niece said the flavor was good.  The server was really nice and the place is clean and cute, but our overall experience was just okay."}
{"text":"This review is not for the brick and mortar restaurant, but for the taco cart they use on the road.   I seriously think these tacos rival that of las palmas. There is finally another street food taco vendor that does good tacos !!  They had a deal running: 1 item for 3.50 or 3 items for 10.00. You could choose from tacos, quesadillas, or empanadas. The fillings for the tacos and quesadillas were chicken, pork,  chorizo , and beef while the empanadas has all the same options minus the chorizo and sub cheese & plantains.  They also served the staple Jarritos pop in the glass bottles and Mexican coke.   The tacos were a hefty size but I was disappointed to see that they were filled with rice underneath of the chorizo. The chorizo has potatoes sautéed in with them which I thought was a great touch, but the rice was truly overkill.  Much like Las Palmas, there is a small condiment bar. No limes, but pico de gallo, onions, cilantro, and squeeze bottles full of Mexican cream and hot sauce. I found the hot sauce to be a bit milder, but others may not be able to handle it. No limes for these delicious tacos, but honestly there was so much flavor it wasn't all that noticeable.   The empanada was fried up fresh, AND they used homemade corn tortillas, just like a pro!!   The price point (3.50 for ONE taco???) and rice in the taco is what made me give these guys only 4 stars, but don't let that keep you from trying them out. The gentleman taking the orders was a truly kind guy with the spirit of a salesman, and the cook was very friendly too! If you need the items to go, just ask and they will wrap the little paper basket in foil for you"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh to try, and this place did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 6:30 and were able to get a table right away. As soon as we sat down they brought out some yummy Mexican chips to snack on. I ordered a margarita was pretty good, and got the guacamole. They make the guacamole at your table, and I have to say it was delisted!! I wasn't crazy about their tortilla chips though. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my bf got the daily special. The food came out quickly and was really yummy. The food definitely had a little kick to it. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"they moved down the street a few blocks next to Mallorca and got even better! We went on a cold Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised by live music. The music was perfectly relaxing, oddly loud but you were able to easily hear you dining partner. The ambience is also great with a few decor changes from the old Ibiza.  Nachos were on special, so we got the chicken nachos in lieu of chips and salsa.  The nachos were good and packed with toppings.  For the main entrees, I got the barbacoa and my partner got the enchilada nortenas.  The barbacoa was super juicy and flavorful.  Loved that the had a veggie option, they were a delicious side.  The enchiladas were great and the steak was a thin, but good addition for the extra dollar.   I will definitely be back here when I'm craving a more authentic approach to Mexican... the food here is like a warm hug!"}
{"text":"Awesome little Mexican restaurant. Small only about 8 tables but great food great service and great pricing!! This is a must go!! If you love Mexican go here and try it out, you won't be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Service was very slow and the waitress was inattentive, especially considering there was less than 5 tables in the whole restaurant. Service staff were kind and friendly, giving my boyfriend a dessert for his birthday, just not quite up to par with most restaurants when it comes to serving.   Also be aware they do not serve alcohol. You can bring your own for a corkage fee, but if you're looking for a place to have a margarita with dinner this isn't the place for you.   Forgot to mention it, but several members of our party including me became sick to their stomach later that night."}
{"text":"Great food!! Very small place with just a couple tables. BYOB means it won't break the bank to have drinks with dinner.  margarita mixer is very good-- homemade. Daily specials makes it fun to try something new."}
{"text":"We were expecting a lot when we came here based on the reviews. We got the guacamole to start which was awesome. Then we got enchiladas, which were only decent, and tamales, which were not great at all. The place seems a bit overrated to be honest."}
{"text":"I had a friend who wanted authentic Mexican food for her birthday. I suggested La Palapa. I had eaten there before and knew they had good food. I wasn't sure if we could reserve tables because it's a smaller dining area but they did reserve tables for us. Their was even another group that was our size that had reserved tables. We were all lively and chatty but it didn't seem loud or chaotic.  We started with chips, guacamole, pick, and verde. I had never had verde served warm with chips but it was really good. The pico and guac were on point as well.  I ordered Flautas y Pollo. Flautas are like small tacos filled with chicken, steak, or pork. They are rolled up and deep fried. My order came with 4. They were chicken (Pollo). They were stacked nicely and were served with a little bit of sour cream and a big spooning of guacamole. The Flautas were crispy on the outside but on the inside the chicken was tender and juicy. On the side were pinto beans and rice. The portions were big!  We were talking and eating and enjoying ourselves. Our server was very nice and did a great job with our group. The birthday girl walked away with a big smile on her face and a tummy full of great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Had high expectations, but the hype didn't live up. Service was really.... weird. Our waitress took our drink orders and told us that the margarita machine was broken, so only on the rocks margs were available. Despite that, several other tables were filled with frozen margaritas. It also took about 4 asks to get a round of waters for the table.  The table side quacamole is awesome, but the queso had a grainy texture, and the \"best selling\" salsa was basically chopped vegetables.   They have a good taco Tuesday special: 3 tacos (of your choosing) for $7, but they were topped with parmesan cheese?   I think this was probably just an off day, but I won't be back. Tacos are subpar, margaritas are small and expensive, and the service just wasn't there."}
{"text":"The new La Palapa location is a lot larger and more accommodating. We had a variety of dishes - I had the steak fajitas that were cooked with pineapple which was very good. Tacos with beef tongue and burrito Steeler had great flavor. They have a very extensive drink selection and the service was excellent! The guacamole is absolutely delicious and made fresh right at the table."}
{"text":"A true 5 star review. I wish I could give even more stars then this. This place is hands down the best Mexican place in the city. I ordered fajitas and they weren't greasy or covered in oil like you may find in other places. The food was pure, and the service was good. I'll be coming back again for sure :)"}
{"text":"So this place is legit. They serve actual Mexican food, not the super Americanized stuff. The him ease hot sauce was great...poblano and habanero peppers. The mole was magical...I could drink it. The service was phenomenal. It was my brother in laws birthday and the owner walked to giant eagle to buy candles. I mean come on! How cool is that!? Who does that? So do yourself a favor and go get some authentic and delicious Mexican food, from some awesome people!"}
{"text":"OMG. They moved into much bigger and improved space and expanded their menu. Much better that it was before. And before it was great!   Great guacamole, especially if you get the make at the table option. This time I got the enchiladas nortenas. Loved them! My wife and daughter got tacos. They have great fillings and really fill them up. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Everything is handmade, even the tortillas and chips. The guacamole is perfect. They have delicious vegetarian food including tortilla soup, not made with meat broth! Don't be put off by the casual appearance - the restaurant looks typical from the outside but the food is extraordinary and the people are super nice."}
{"text":"The place is the bomb for authentic Mexican food. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, the place itself was like the size of a person's living room, giving the restauranteur a homier feeling. A word of advice: make reservations since they have limited seating. The NoWait app is a great way to make your reservations. My favorite dish to get at Mexican restaurants are flautas and the ones from La Palapa do not disappoint. Their portion size is huge and I ended up having a lot left over. Whenever I crave for Mexican food, I always think of La Palapa and can't wait until I go back!"}
{"text":"So I stopped in here for lunch on a whim and so glad I did. I will definitely be back. I'm somewhat of a Mexican food snob in the way that the only thing I don't like about Mexican food is when someone tries to Americanize it. That is definitely not the case here. Authentic, legit, simple, no fuss Mexican grub. I had barbacoa taco and a chicken quesadilla with the best sour cream and gauc I've had in a long time. But the shining star? The cream of poblano and corn soup! According to my delightful server, I didn't get his name but he was awesome attentive and informative, it's award winning and completely vegetarian....and absolutely de-lish. The broth was thin and light with fresh cilantro but not too much to become overpowering and the spice from the poblanos was perfect. Muchas Gracias La Palapa para almuerzo. (I only had 3 years of Spanish so if that doesn't translate right, blame Señora Flasco)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for more authentic Mexican in Pittsburgh, this is your spot. Satisfying and flavorful portions at a low price point. I had a chicken quesadilla (love that it comes with free guac!) and a carnitas taco. Each were around $3, such a steal. The homemade tortilla chips were a win too.  Also, love that it's a BYOB and if you bring your own tequila, they will provide margarita mix!"}
{"text":"This was great!   Our waitress was prompt and super nice, and we were seated quickly. The menu has a ton of different options, as well as various vegetarian items.  We got the flautas and the special of the day (chorizo burrito covered in queso), as well as the fresca of the day (watermelon).   The flautas were soo good! They have a hot sauce and that + flautas are the perfect combination togehter. The beans were good, but the rice was kinda weirdly dry.   It was a great Mexican restaurant, a lot better than a lot of the other options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It's finally here! Mexican food in Pittsburgh that is amazing. I ordered the Chorizo, Barbacoa and Pollo tacos. They not only had generous portions but the meat was perfectly seasoned. The toppings were not too heavy or too light and the prices were low ($3.25 a taco). This tastes like genuine Mexican food, and this isn't something I experience often (if ever) in Pittsburgh.  Beyond great food you can expect excellent service, our server Lester was friendly and attentive. A really good server is proactive and when our Mexican cokes were low he brought us glasses of water without any input from us. The owner was also very friendly and checked up on us. We felt at home and stayed to talk with them about how they're enjoying Pittsburgh.   You can get take out (which I will be doing frequently) or eat in where there's seating for around 20 or so people  The place has a great atmosphere and is conveniently located at a good part of the South Side. I can't wait to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Hate to leave a bad review but we just left la palapa after finding a roach in my child cheese quesadilla.  Totally disgusted."}
{"text":"NIce little Mexican restaurant.   Seats about 20. Nice selection of some traditional Mexican food.   Selected the lunch special. The Sopa de Verdure (Veggie soup) is not your mothers veggie soup, due to the cilantro.  It was tasty with lots of veggies.  The agua fresca horchata was very refreshing. The empanada and enchilada were good but the endhilada was on the cold side."}
{"text":"Food is really good, and the service is so awesome!! : D We loved our waitress today!  Ordered fish tacos- sooooooo good. Don't really like chipotle pork tacos. It tasted okay. Just not for me."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for this restaurant that offers more traditional Mexican fare. Not for everyone, but if you are tired of same Mexican food you get everywhere, try La Palapa.  Probably not a good choice for the pickiest eaters.  Be sure to try the Horchata and check out the daily lunch specials."}
{"text":"Agree with all the positive comments. These folks will most certainly move up to more grand surroundings as if they continue produce such excellent and fresh Mexican inspired food....."}
{"text":"We started with the chips and guac which are amazing. Super big portion and flavorful for both.  My husband got fajitas with steak which he said were awesome. There were pepper onions mushrooms and pineapple. Also came with rice veggies and of course the warm Shells. Also a huge portion.  I got two tacos which I didn't even come close to finishing. Tender meat with a a lot of flavor. I added their homemade spicy sauce which added a great kick.   It's byob too.   Lastly, over the top service.   Totally coming back."}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, I'm extremely picky about my Mexican food. La Palapa is great! I always start with their chips and salsa - and finish with their three enchilada dish. I love that it's BYOB ... And in my taste, white wine tastes best with Mexican food!   I can't wait to go back ... And maybe one of these days I'll try something new. Their vegetarian soup and fish tacos sound good also!"}
{"text":"Great hand made Mexican food, very fresh ingredients. Perfectly seasoned with great tastes. Reminds me of good Mexican restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"La Palapa is located on a \"quieter\" block of the South Side. From the outside, they could benefit from some brighter lights or more eye-catching signage to draw in more people. There's seating for about 30 in this small Mexican restaurant. It never seems to be very busy, but the food is great! My girlfriend and I started with chips and salsa. We got both the verde and pico salsas and both were very good. I like that they warm up the verde salsa. For entrees, I ordered the Lengua en Salsa Verde (beef tongue) with rice and beans and Toni ordered the chicken Enchiladas Verdes. My beef tongue was incredibly tender and flavorful. The meat just fell apart. I used my corn tortillas to create tacos with the beef, rice, and their very spicy hot sauce. Toni's enchiladas were tasty, but the chicken was a little dry.  All in all, this place has consistently good and AUTHENTIC Mexican food. $33 for 2 entrees + chips and salsa is slightly higher than some Mexican joints, but the quality and portion sizes make it easily justifiable. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch, and it's very good! I love authentic Mexican food and this definitely hits the spot. The price is good, too. I hope La Palapa sticks around because Southside was in need of a good, authentic Mexican restaurant. It finally has one!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was a bit warm and muggy and the back covered patio smelled of garbage from the dumpster that was presumably right behind it. The quesadillas and the guacamole are fantastic. But the ambiance is lacking. The tables on the patio don't match and it looks like a bit of a mish mash of old and poorly arranged furniture. Our food came out so quick that it was before our beers, which isn't great business practice to get people to stay for a second drink with dinner. Next time I think I'll order takeout, but I hope they step it up because this place has potential!"}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic Mexican food.   Fresh ingredients, well prepared, and generous portions that don't cross over into excessive.   The Barbacoa was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The chorizo was spicy and delicious.   Try the hot sauce. Spicy and fresh.   My only complaint is I haven't been here before.   BYOB."}
{"text":"Fabulous, authentic Mexican food in a family friendly, cozy setting. Topping off our great experience was that we happened to come on a Sunday evening when a live Mariachi band was performing! Fun!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican food you can get in Pittsburgh. Great service and byob. I rarely complement the chef, but I had to with the nachos I had. The food is prepared with great attention to detail, If anyone is craving Mexican food... I always suggest this restaurant. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I loved the food and service here. The only con I found was how small the restaurant is. This place is extremely small. There are not a lot of tables so if you have a party of 4 or more they have to put tables and chairs together to make enough room to accommodate the party. That being said, people will have to wait outside until customers are ready to leave in order to get a table."}
{"text":"Holy Mole! This place is the real deal with authentic Mexican food and fabulous service. It's BYOB so the five of us brought a couple of bottles of wine to enjoy with our dinner. The friendly waiter uncorked, poured, and even switched out our glasses in between bottles. There was a $3 corkage fee.  We started with guacamole and chips. The guacamole was delicious and chunky, but the chips were a bit stale (which was surprising because of the amount of them I imagine that this place goes through in a night).   For my entree I had the Enchiladas with mole sauce. One each of ground beef, chicken, and cheese, they were generously topped with the mole of my dreams and served with rice and pinto beans. I loved the enchilada tortillas and the mole tasted as though it was simmered for hours by an abuela in the kitchen. It was absolutely amazing. The chicken and beef enchiladas were both terrific.... and the cheese one, while filled generously,  could have been hotter. The cheese was barely melted.  For dessert I has wonderful house-made flan. It was the best I had ever had in a restaurant.... creamy, dreamy, and wonderful.... with the deep taste of melted sugar filling each bite. \"La Palapa\" is a solid choice for authentic Mexican food..... an I highly recommend anything topped with that amazing mole!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. All of it. I can't stop eating it. The enchiladas are so damn good that I will eat everything on my plate even though I'm making myself sick. It's that good, I just inhale it. The Rojas is just sensational."}
{"text":"Wow! Such a gem of a restaurant. The entire staff is incredibly nice and generous. Also, the food is FANTASTIC! The tortilla soup and the manga salsa have changed my life for the better. And the decor is so charming and provides for a really great atmosphere. If you're in town, be sure to give this place a visit!!"}
{"text":"Was lookin for some good Mexican food (from Texas so we have a lot) after a long trip overseas. This place is definitely hole in the wall feel and the prices are that of a nice upscale Mexican restaurant. It's byob so you save money in that regard but the lack of a margarita just didn't make sense to me. Food was pretty good and service was great."}
{"text":"A great little mom & pop type Mexican restaurant right in the midst of all the bars on Carson St. in the South Side.  It is a bit of a dive, and it feels like you are eating in someone's home, which I tend to like myself.  The food was far more tasty and authentic than most of the better Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, and is reasonably priced.  I got 2 different types of samplers - more than enough to feed 2 people, and everything on there was great.  If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for their house made hot sauce - very nice flavor.  Service was great - we had a young gentleman who was the owner's son - he was very polite, friendly and professional.  We will definitely be back.  It is also BYOB, and they have horchata."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food was! I ordered the Costilla de Puerco, which was tender pork ribs in a mole sauce. The meat fell right off the bone and the mole sauce was packed with flavor. My friends got the quesadillas and fajitas and were happy with their food and portion size too.   It's a pretty small place and we made reservations 2 days beforehand to accommodate 7 people. We pretty much took half of the seats.   I will definitely come back whenever I crave for Mexican!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  We stopped here today for lunch and everything was absolutely amazing!!!  For an appetizer we had Nachos with Beef and Cheese.  These are now my #1 nachos in Pittsburgh.  Homemade chips, guacamole made *correctly*, cheese and meat and veggies on every chip.  The presentation is great and the portion size could be a meal in itself.  5/5 stars  The fiancee had the Chicken and Mushroom Enchiladas with vegetables instead of pinto beans.  She said it was delicious and almost finished all of it.  I tried a vegetable and even I would have eaten them.  I'm typically a strict carnivore...  5/5 stars  My Burrito Steelers was great.  I cannot mention other restaurants on here but my old favorite was *Fad Mex* if I wanted a burrito.  La Palapa has replaced them!  Every bite was a little bit different and fresh spices emanated from it.  I could only finish half of it because of the monster plate of nachos.  It was amazing...  5/5 stars  For the aforementioned food and two Mexican Coca Colas the total bill was $39.  And if you don't know what I mean by Mexican Coca Cola, TRY IT.  It's made with real cane sugar and no high-fructose corn syrup like Americanized craptastic coke up here.  They're $3 but worth every penny and you can tell a difference immediately.  I highly recommend this place if you like Mexican food.  Next trip...I'm trying the empanadas as well.  Compliments to the chef!"}
