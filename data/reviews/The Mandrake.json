{"text":"Horrible food, worse service--a blight on the Charlotte restaurant landscape. I have had to eat here many times, and it's always the worst. Stale ingredients, slow service, and and overall sad place where they keep trying to be cool but never quite get there. Bonus: \"Naked sushi\" events are tacky as hell.  PS--The five-star reviews all sound like they are written by friends."}
{"text":"The first frustration with The Mandrake was the parking.  There were no open street spaces, so we pulled into the parking deck behind the restaurant (as mentioned on Open Table).  There were no signs as to where you should park, so we pulled onto the 2nd floor.  All staircases are locked and all doors can only be accessed with a key fob.  Going from the 2nd floor of the garage to the 1st floor was great fun in heels.  I called the restaurant to get directions and they were vague- an employee ended up coming to get us out of the deck.  The door we were supposed to use as an exit was a loading dock door that was down a few stairs from the main level and had caution tape all across it...never would have thought that was a proper door to use as an exit.  When mentioning the parking was quite a situation the response I received was \"at least it's free\".  I don't know about you, but I would much rather spend a few bucks and have my car valeted- the deck is even set-up for that.  Once inside, we decided to get a drink and enjoy our time there.  I was excited as this is a new restaurant to Charlotte and it was Restaurant Week!  Our waitress let us know she was overwhelmed and that another waitress would be by to help us.  It took the other gal a while to get there, but they were busy being RW, so no sweat.  We go to order drinks and they're out of a key ingredient for my friend's cocktail.  No big deal, she picked something else out.  Next, it's time to order dinner.  We decided to do the limited RW menu and our waitress let us know that they were out of 2 dishes (of course these were 2 I really wanted) and that another dish had a substitution to part of it, but I decided to order it anyway.  The waitress leaves to put in our order and comes back later to say the dish with the substitution is no longer available.  3 things I wanted to order were completely gone!  Apparently the dishes that weren't available aren't part of their normal menu- I thought the whole point of RW was to get a sample of what the restaurant had to offer??  It became down right comical when my friend ordered a glass of wine with her dinner.  The waitress came over with a half-pour of wine and let her know that is all that was left in house.  It was on the house, but after half of their RW menu was gone as well it was enough to voice an open opinion.  As far as the food, it was so-so.  I didn't have one dish that left a lasting impression.  My steak was not cooked to the correct temp and didn't have much flavor, the chicken dish had an overwhelmingly grilled taste- barely tasted the coconut flavor of the dish.  I will say the dessert I had did have a great flavor- pistachio semifreddo with ginger bark.  Tasted pretty good, but the consistency was wrong.  Thank goodness they served it in a small cup because it was practically soup.  In case you are wondering, the manager did come by to address the fact that they were out of beer cheese.  At that point, I had to laugh and give him the laundry list of things that weren't right with our dining experience.  He asked if we needed anything and I told him I just wanted to make it through this dinner.  I had finished my cocktail and ordered another through him.- which was not that great.  Although, I'll admit I'm a cocktail snob so I may be to critical there (but probably not).  When I looked at my check, he had comped the cocktail.  I wish I could say that is where the frustrations ended, but they followed us right back to the parking lot.  We could have walked down the street to the loading dock door and back up the garage ramp up to the 2nd floor, but the manager used his fob so that we could go through the main lobby and access the elevator.  That was nice except that you can not access the floor we were parked on without having a key fob!  Luckily, a lady in the elevator used hers and we were able to leave.  Needless to say, I will never be back there again."}
{"text":"Unless you're a top Michelin starred chef you should be taking substitutions. Get over it chef don different people enjoy different textures and have different taste paletes."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere, however, the food was horrible and overpriced ! The sweet potato chips came out black, way too overcooked. The Brussels were undercooked and lacked flavor. The three different red wines we tried had turned. Also not very Veg friendly. All the bread has milk and eggs in it, which is not necessary. This was our second time trying this place, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Dark, cozy interior, good music, and sizable beer menu.  Friendly and welcoming staff. Food was excellent and we'll presented. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Incredible tapas experience! Our server, Paul, made sure everything was on point from start to finish. He made excellent recommendations based on our preferences and even introduced us to the chef (Donnie) so that we could have a specially prepared final course. You must try: poke nachos, truffled Seabass, pork belly wontons, roasted dates and pancetta, and caramelized duck."}
{"text":"One star for really good food, that had the potential to be amazing food were it hot.  Seemed like my lovely wife's food sat in a window waiting for my sushi to be rolled.  That alone would not be a killer for a restaurant.  Rewind to service... server had little to no food knowledge and offered no suggestions,  Literally came to the table and said what can I get you to drink.  Ordered a moderately expensive bottle of wine and server never served wine outside of popping the cork out of the bottle and pouring first glass.  Never checked back on how we were enjoying the entrées until we waved him over to let him know it was cold.  Forgot to bring soy sauce for the sushi.  When manager stopped by the table at out request and I explained, in a nice and calm manner the many issues we had experienced, his response was \"What do you want me to do?\".  No attempt to recover and win the guest over, make them happy, or make it right.  Server and manager avoided our table after we brought up our concerns, which was confusing.  Poor service, and worse management response to issue.  Will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience.  We went for dinner and every dish we had was amazing.  From the beginning they were helpful for us.  We were running late for our reservations due to the CIAA traffic but they got us in right away and were very understanding due to the crowds.  The wait staff was very friendly and informed on the dishes. We shared the lobster-mac, bourbon chicken, fried brussel sprouts, and crab cake.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of their dishes.  The executive chef was friendly and made some recommendations for us the next time we are in.  We are already planning our next visit and plan on bringing our neighbors.  I almost forgot, we got the pecan pie cheesecake to go and it was perhaps the best cheesecake we have had.  Go here with confidence that you will enjoy the atmosphere and your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times (always lunch). I'll be honest, I think a star rating is very contingent on food quality compared to price. Most of the time, I'm not rating on decor, service etc and I've seen a lot of comments about these aspects (never had any issues with anything - the service has always been great - and I think the decor is pretty standard / hip - IDGAF about that though).   Hands down this menu is one of the most creative I've seen in Charlotte and incredibly tasty. Everything my party has ordered was unique. One person ordered a chicken Caesar salad, and I was expecting a normal fare and BOOM.. Deconstructed, barely chopped, grilled romaine lettuce with delicious chicken. Lobster flatbreads. Stuffed avocados with watermelon and sashimi tuna. Ghost pepper jack cheese. I don't see many other places in Charlotte offer this type of fare and I love it! The prices are very reasonable compared to the quality and unique pairings.   I highly recommend for lunch, one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Great place with great food and service.  I've been to this place couple times.  The thing I like this place about is they always have something new in the menu! And most of time those new ones are great. They often host some cool events such as the premiere of the local artists, and those events make your dining experience very memorable.  I would say servers are well educate. One time, Michelle took care of our table, and her service and hospitality were great! If you have a chance to visit this restaurant, ask Michelle by name. You won't regret that."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on Saturday June 6th to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary.  We used a groupon which helped offset the cost a little bit.  I'll break it down  We arrived on time for our reservation and were promptly seated at a nice table next to a window.  The server greeted us immediately and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant.  We decided to go with a molly dooker (sp) blue eyed boy shiraz  wine to go with our meal, we enjoyed the wine and I think it was a fair value and went well with what we had to eat.    We started with the pretzels and beer cheese and the duck confit rolls.  Both of these items were really well put together with the rolls winning of the two.  For main course we tried the bone marrow (never had this before but it was good, wish there had been more though) and the dragon wings, hot.  I would say that the dragon wings were the least favorite, the sauce just kind of felt tossed on, the wings were good, cooked well and very meaty though.  For desert we had the deep fried oreos, holy cow these were a hit!  Not too greasy and very good, I never thought goat cheese would have worked here but it did!  All told this was a fun place and very enjoyable, we will go back to try a few more of the dishes hopefully soon."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time there last night. They have a new menu and we ordered the Brussels sprouts, lobster risotto puppies, blackened shrimp Mac and cheese, and Paul's sandwich. So delicious we loved everything.  Service was awesome and we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good service. The menu advertises tapas and small plates, but the prices and portion sizes felt more of an a la carte meal. The portions were large and the duck breast even came with a spring roll on the side. Misleading menu led to a very heavy ordering and bill. The Brussels sprouts were amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere.  Great drink selection (wines, local craft beers, cool cocktails).  Free parking uptown.  Amazing value and you get to enjoy creations from a chef named Charlotte's best (Donnie Simmons).  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. It is an intimate restaurant with a diverse tapas menu. I truly do understand the negative feedback. At our last meal, we were so happy with the conversations that we had with the bartender that we ended up having a drink just to stay even though we were so full from the meal. It is an experience for those who enjoy food, especially small plates/tapas. The Brussels sprouts are amazing. We always get the lamb. I really cannot say enough about this place. I look forward to the upcoming events this summer!"}
{"text":"The only way i can describe this place is .....One of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my entire life. There is 3 factors in a good restaurant that makes it successful. Customer service , Food and location. I must first start off with customer service as it is by far the most important. Not only did the chef come by and thank us for coming in but also explained to us his passion for food and entertainment. Then the GM came to us and personally thanked us for coming in.  The waiter was as equally kind and treated us as family. And was very honest with the food that hes tried and has not tried and explained why some stuff was good for the occasion. The food was amazing , the chef was voted best in Charlotte, I don't have to say anything else he is number one. Last but not least is location. Great location easy to get to and awesome amenities and other to do around. We will be back very soon already planned a trip next week. I really hope you go check it out totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great new hot spot in Charlotte!! We had requested a special tasting menu for friends from out of town. There were 8 of us and it was an amazing experience! The owner, manger and chef greeted us at the door and it was just incredible from then on!  The food was an experience like none other! We had amazing service through out and our own table side sushi chef!  Chef Don put together our whole event from apps to pairing cocktails to meal to desert!  Check out the Mandrake and go with an empty stomach!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out with a co-worker. I ordered the 6 Dragon wings (mild) with a side of fries. Be careful 6 wings to them is really 3 whole wings. The drum is considered a wing it's just so happens to be connected to the rest of the wing...They slick, they got me!!! $8 for 3 whole wings!!! I got them mild and they were quite tasty. As for the fries I really don't care to much for seasoned fries but they were pretty good too...And the should have been for $4.00...Lol My co-worker had the Lobster mac & cheese and the crab cakes. Tasted fine but yet both were a little deceiving... The Lobster mac and cheese is not what you see on the website. On the website you see macaroni noodles that are more yellow in color but this was penne noodles with more of a white cheddar look... Tasted okay though. Another precaution do not try to make a meal on the crab cakes they are the size of a quarter...Lol  Will I go back?? Right now thatz a little up in the air but at least I know what to expect. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Being from the northeast, I've been accustomed to mediocre food in the area. Then I came here tonight and it was a wow.  Chef Donnie is as good as any chef in the best restaurants in New York City. I had a few things.  The salmon on risotto was incredible.  The pork belly was like butter and the sushi was as fresher than a live fish. And if you had room left the cheesecake pumpkin pie was simply out of this world.  If you want the best food in the area come here.  If not, go anywhere else. It is incredible!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Mandrake and the food was delicious. The tapas portion are larger than expected and reasonably priced. This restaurant is a real hidden treasure. Every meal cooked by the Chef, Travis, is to die for and the service is always excellent. Make a trip down trade and try this new spot - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I personally enjoyed this place a lot. The owner was great, my cocktail was great, and my sushi was great. Going to be a place I frequent!"}
{"text":"I used to only hit The Mandrake for a good glass of wine because the food was sub par. The new chef has turned this place into a GREAT place to eat. The duck plate is unbelievable. The cheese plate is amazing. The pork belly is right up there on the list too. I definitely recommend everyone give this place a shot, especially with the new menu!"}
{"text":"Was here earlier for a meetup and networking event. Place was pretty empty for a Wednesday night.   Place was a bit pricey. Inquired about any bar bites or drink special and waitress had no idea. Headed over to the bar area and found out about their buy one get one sushi as for bar bites their menu just changed.  Decided to get drinks first and ordered the \"Mi Amor\"- St. German Elderflower, Prosecco with a Candied Hibiscus Flower. Which was good."}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing! We went for Sunday brunch and bottomless Mamosa's.  There was a group of 6 of us and we had booked reservations, after about an hour and a half the manager asked us to hurry up and started clearing away our napkins, full waters, small plates and half consumed Mamosa's! I have never felt more disrespected- our table spent $300 at brunch so to be asked to hurry up is completely insulting.  Again, our waitress was completely amazing, the food was great but my friends and I will not be returning because of our experience with the manager.  5+stars for the wait staff and food -1 star for the manager."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner and the service was sooooo bad. About half of the orders were wrong or out of something. Drink specials were extremely misleading and food was just eh decent. So disappointed. Won't ever come back to this place. Waitress really wasn't good at all and was a huge problem the whole night. Very very disappointed after spending so much money"}
{"text":"The place looks very nice but def not the best brunch. Service was good. I will not return for brunch just were not enough options for me. May check it out for lunch"}
{"text":"Review update... I've been here 3 additional times after my initial review of attending twice and I'm increasing it to 5 stars.   Food is always on point the low stars were due to customer service and super long wait times which they've improved dramatically.   Must Trys: Try various options, its small plates are conducive to it.  Brussel sprouts, Rangoon  (any one on menu), shrimp Mac & cheese, cheese dip, and fat a $$ crab cake - biggest crab ever!   I've been sitting at the bar lots and the bar keeps are pretty awesome and handsome."}
{"text":"A group of 8 friends and I went to The Mandrake for Girls Night Out. This was an excellent choice for a large group! Our waiter was Paul and he was awesome! He had a great personality, he kept us laughing, which made the night even more enjoyable. Actually when I think about it all of the staff were super nice and accomodating. We even had the chef send out a few dishes on the house, mainly because we literally order everything from there Mandrake Tapas menu and some 2 and 3 times. The brussel sprouts were as good as everyone said they were, the Lob Mac and Cheese was so good I think we order 3 of them for the table. The Honey Sriracha wings were slap your mama good, as well as the fried cheesecake had the whole table saying Mmmmm!!!  So needless to say I give The Mandrake and the friendly staff 5 stars! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Excellent recommendations.  Went above and beyond.   Great craft beer.   Andy and Molly made the experience worth while."}
{"text":"The Mandrake has a good atmosphere, and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  However, the restaurant struggles to operate as a small plate concept.  There are two things critical for a small plate concept to work: timing of the dishes, and clean plates to enjoy them.  My wife and I ordered 5 items to share for dinner. Rather than spacing them out so we could enjoy each one, they brought them all out within 5 minutes of each other.  We also had to ask several times for them to bring us clean plates.  The food was good overall, but don't go expecting a small plate experience.  Also take into consideration that you'll likely be eating everything that you order at the same time."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus, this place is the bomb. Died and gone to restuarant heaven. Came here for Queens feast and will be back. The food is outstanding. Had the pork belly crostini, lime pork tips, flank steak and the white chocolate mousse with candied bacon. OMG! It was super fantastic. I'm coming back cause their menu is unique and enticing. You enter the kingdom of flavors and tastes walking into this gem. Go here. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"THE MANDRAKE has certainly upped the ante with the welcoming of Chef Donnie Simmons to its kitchen crew. Dubbed the city's Best Chef of 2015 by Creative Loafing Charlotte, Don is expectedly presenting dynamic takes on both tried-and-true and entirely new tapas. The casually classy Uptown restaurant not only benefits from a now revived and entirely overhauled menu, but a refreshed dining atmosphere with a reawakened food audience. Located conveniently between Center City's culinary Third Ward and residential Fourth Ward -- i.e. a couple blocks from BB&T Ballpark and The VUE apartments from either side -- Mandrake also has the benefit of relatively more accessible parking (e.g. surface lots directly across the street), not to mention a significantly larger ratio of local repeats to once-in-a-while passersby and QC visitors.  Food. Without a doubt, the total and utter freshness of each of the five items brought to my table was what validated an automatic 4 stars from me. The Buffalo Chicken Dip was one of the most SATISFYING [and filling] appetizers I've ever had. (Perfectly house-made thick-cut pita chips.) Their golden beet & praline salad over orange sherry vinaigrette was also notable. I then opted for the night's special, per Don's recommendation -- a delicate, extremely succulent offering featuring their catch-of-the-day. Execution was decent, albeit too minimal in overall dish complexity for my taste. This was followed strongly by my favorite plate(s) of the evening... custom-crafted sushi that were nicely augmented variants on their 'Mandrake,' 'Clear Water' and '333' specialty rolls. (I'd return over and again if but only for Mandrake's sushi.) Lastly, Don's dessert truffles. Served poptruffle/trufflepop style, the chilled confections were as velvety and dense as they come. (Again, I'd return even just to grab a to-go truffle order.)  Drinks. Mixologist interaction was fantastic, and though any of Mandrake's cocktails will win you over, all are simply revitalized [and well-planned] twists on established recipes. Personal favorites... 'Smoking the Green' (tequila, cilantro, lime, agave nectar, burnt lava salt) and 'Wall Flower' (gin, lemon, lavender syrup, Chartreuse, Angostura, optional egg white), well as the offered handshaken default of the season, e.g. rum + muddied ingredients. The restaurant also boasts a rather exhaustive -- yet admittedly costly -- selection of red, white, blended, sparkling and dessert wines. While $8 will grant you a glass of dark-spirited Argentinian Malbec, a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon can set you back $110.  Value. In all honesty, the only potential limitation for a patron here is price. By and large, the menu's price points are on par with any of the other establishments' on CLT's restaurant row; however, let not Mandrake's \"small plates + wine\" sub-moniker deter you from giving them your business. Customers spoke, they listened, and dish sizes have been made more substantial with absolutely no compromise in taste nor quality. $10-20 will fix any and all hunger pangs, the higher end of said range providing you Mandrake's classics like their Cheese & Charcuterie Board ($15), seared duck w/ salted caramel sauce ($17), and oversized scallops atop pecan butter broth & creamed corn ($18). I cannot emphasize enough the freshness of their food -- this alone justifies multiple visits a week for those who live nearby.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.5 - Food taste and quality = 4.25 - Portion size = 4.5 - Price = 4.75 - Atmosphere = 5 (EXCELLENT vibes... everyone, whether staff or patron, seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves... abundant outdoor dining too...) - General service = 5+ (my fifth star... chatting w/ exec. chef Don, the mixologist, the itamae, plus Mandrake's owner at different points throughout the meal provided great insight into their respective passions...) - Waitstaff = 4.25 - Location = 4"}
{"text":"Tonight I went to mandrake for restaurant week (queen's feast) and it was the worst meal I've eaten since moving to Charlotte over 6 years ago. I've actually never written a Yelp review, but after walking out the door $60 poorer, hungry and annoyed, I thought I'd leave my thoughts here so other hungry restaurant goers could redirect heir reservation to a more worthy location.   Here's the issue. If you do a \"prefix\" menu, make the meal worth the prefix price. We got 3 plates, tiny plates of food that tasted o.k. The chicken carbonara was two chunks of strangely cooked chicken that tasted like it was not thawed properly and thrown in a skillet frozen. It laid atop a bed of a few noodles with no taste. Let me also mention the strange chunks of fatty hormel Bologna thrown in (the pancetta).  The starters were o.k. - egg rolls were tiny, like the size of a small thumb and the arugula salad was tasty but again, small.  I understand the concept of tapas, but when you craft a queen's feast menu and label it entree, I expect to be full and happy when I leave. But today I didn't have that experience. Rather I left annoyed that I paid that much for nothing. My money literally went no where.  And to top it off, when I didn't eat most of my noodle meal, they acknowledged I didn't like it but didn't do anything about it. They took it away and I sat there waiting for my check to pay for the food I didn't eat because it was gross.   But don't take it from me. Pay them a visit if you're looking for a disappointing culinary experience in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week and the items we got were pretty decent. However, after the appetizers, we waited close to two hours and instead of bringing out the main entree, they brought out our desserts.  Apparently our orders got mixed up and it never got put in and our waiter did not even apologize.  We ended up not wanting the food anymore after two hours!  No one even came to talk to us after all and expect us to come back next time! Poor service! Will probably not come back anymore!"}
{"text":"Menu looked great and we were excited to get a reservation for 8:15 on Saturday night. Unfortunately they had us wait at the bar for over 20 minutes while 3 other tables were sat and 3 others remained open. We left."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience. My food took forever and we waited for an hour for our checks. The \"manager\" was rolling silverware instead of helping the one waitress that he gave us for a reserved 20 top table. He was aware that we were coming for a few weeks. That poor waitress! This place really turned a good night into an ugly one. I honestly wish I could give no stars. Needless to say I will never be back."}
{"text":"As my husband said:I'd give them ten stars if that was the choice. Food and service - outstanding;  We sampled:  Brussel sprouts  - incredible and I hate Brussel sprouts; skrimp Mac and cheese - creamy yumminess with bacon; lobster risotto puppies - a delicate hush puppy filled with creamy lobster goodness; brisket rangoons- filled with tender brisket and cheddar habanero with an apple cider glaze, crunchy, beefy, spicy with sweetness; the special alligator stuffed crab cakes unique and full of flavor. All of these had unique and multi dimensional flavors. Hard to pick a favorite and yet we did: the poke roll. Imagine a Hawaiian version of a lobster roll done with generous bites of tuna, arugula and avocado. It was light, bright and full of flavor. We did make room for dessert and enjoyed a key lime pie like I haven't tasted in forever.  All the while our server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly yet allowed us to enjoy our date night too. The rest of the staff was attentive as well but not intrusive.  Chef Donnie has a gift for creating unique delicious food you want to eat more and more of, and see what he creates next. He is supported by an amazing staff in the kitchen. The love for what they do comes out in the food and everyone there is so friendly. Make this your next meal!!"}
{"text":"Very good!!! I had the Brussels sprouts that many yelp people recommended which were delicious!! Then I had the breakfast brisket which was a pleasant surprise!! And mom had the pan seared salmon which was also very good!! Nice random restaurant selection!! Would definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the food was amazing. We ordered lamb chops, risotto, key lime, and something else that was really good. We sat outside and it was an overall great experience. Second time I came here, I brought out of town guests and was told there was a new and better chef. So we ordered a bunch of small plates and drinks thinking we were in for a treat since it was supposed to be even better than the last time. Some of the things ordered were lobster mac and cheese, Mandrake roll (which we never got), brussel sprouts, calamari, lamb meatballs, flat bread, etc. We were wrong. There wasn't a thing I would try again. I felt awful because my friends picked up the tab and not only was it expensive, but the food was pretty bad. Also, the tables were pretty crowded together, so it was a little awkward. Came back a third time for lunch and it was a joke. I ordered the avocado toast which was supposed to have duck egg, goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, and guacamole instead of avocado plus a side. When my food came out, I noticed immediately there was no pomegranate, no side (listed under the section that includes a side but this one apparently didn't come with one), and a very tiny spread of guacamole (so little that I saw mostly the flatbread underneath) and very little goat cheese. Pretty sure it was a regular egg too. I asked the server if I could get some pomegranate and more guacamole and she came back and said they're all out. Surprised they even let that out of the kitchen like that. She didn't offer to let me order something else so I asked and got the fish tacos with fries. The fries were good but that was it."}
{"text":"I wish I had more stars!! This place is absolutely amazing!! I have read about the Mandrake several times before actually visiting. I wish I had gone sooner!  My fiancé and I made reservations (which is encouraged) for a Valentine's date night. Even on a busy night the staff was extremely attentive and friendly. Our server Eric was very helpful and offered us several suggestions on the menu. The manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was going smoothly. The chef Donnie even came out to meet a lot of the guests. He stopped at our table and recommended a few of his favorite menu items.  Okay so on to the food. The Mandrake is a tapas style restaurant (which we love) so you get to try a lot of different items. We ordered the brussel sprouts with prosciutto, lobster mac & cheese, risotto puppies and the special Oyster Rockefeller. The star of the night was the special. The oysters were the best oyster Rockefeller that I've had in a long time! But the presentation was crazy! They came to the table on fire! It was definitely s show stopper. My second favorite of the night was the lobster mac. You should definitely order this one.  I can't wait to go back to this restaurant. The food is phenomenal. The service you receive here is exceptional as well."}
{"text":"We were excited to find a new Uptown restaurant on Restaurant.com and went here for date night to try it out. The experience was a little mixed.   We were promptly seated with my chair under a plant that had a dangling leaf that hit me every time I got up or sat down. I should have asked to move places since the majority of the restaurant was open but that seemed like a hassle after I had already sat down. For a wine bar this place had a very limited wine menu but the pinot noir I settled on was decent. There was a good beer selection for my dining companion.   We decided on the following for our meal - lobster mac and cheese, mushroom truffle flatbread, seared salmon pomegranate and the surf and turf roll. The lobster mac and cheese was a complete disappointment with the mac and cheese component being sadly reminiscent of Kraft boxed mac and cheese. The mushroom truffle flatbread was good with plenty of cheese and obviously straight out of the oven. The surf and turf roll was delicious. The salmon was amazing! Unfortunately all the food came out at once so we didn't have time to linger over each one as it was presented which is part of the fun at a tapas restaurant.   I will probably return if the coupons stay on Restaurant.com and get the salmon again. The portions were pretty large for a tapas style meal so we didn't need to order as much as we did."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge disappointment! Fabulous location but that's all they have to offer. This is supposed to be a wine and tapas bar and the wine selection was sub par to say the least and the servers were not knowledgeable on the offerings. It only gets worse from there, we ordered 4 starters/tapas plates and they came out in 5 minutes. The food was cold and didn't even taste good. Definitely not fresh ingredients! We paid the bill and ran out of there all in under 30 minutes. We will definitely not be going back here."}
{"text":"The new management has definitely stepped up their service here. The outdoor atmosphere was great and servers were easy to talk to and attentive."}
{"text":"Great new place that opened up right in the heart of Charlotte! It was my first time here and I tried it out and it was very good. Great service, Drinks and of course of the food. I recommend the lobster mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest new spot in Charlotte!  If Soul and Goos Food had a baby, this would be it.  The service is amazing from the bartenders to the manager, Andy.  I can't wait until summer to have dinner and cocktails on the patio."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as the menu looks great and the ambiance is cozy and Romantic... But the bar is just lacking big time!! The food was ok, and the service was amazing, but when you order a Hendricks and lime up, and the server comes back to ask what \"up\" means, you know you're getting a hodge podge of a drink! Would try again but not on another special occasion"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and ordered takeout. The staff was extremely nice while I waited and chatted it up as it wasn't very busy. Ordered the dragon wings with sesame miso glaze. The wings were undercooked and had no flavor to the extent that I ended up not going past the first wing and chalking the meal up as a loss. The glaze was cold and tossed on after the wings were completely removed. There was an additional container of glaze on the side and the glaze is delicious. I'll give this place another chance despite the short comings."}
{"text":"I've given this place two chances and both have failed. On the most recent visit, I walked in to the restaurant at 5 pm and was treated like the scum of the earth for walking in without a reservation , to an empty restaurant . There were two tables occupied and two people at the bar. They then seated us at the farthest back table by the bathrooms. We asked to be moved and they said they had to check the reservations list. .. Again pretty much 95 percent of the restaurant is open. They ended up moving us, but I almost left due to the treatment. The food is terrible. We walked in expecting the menu to have sushi, salads and apps per it's original roots. This was not the case. Fried food and menu items loaded on grease and cheese at every menu line item. I couldn't even eat a sandwich because the bread was soaked in oil and grease. The only redeeming factor was the waitress.  My first visit, I had a waiter that didn't know the menu, didn't know wine and proceeded to tell us that the restaurant didn't offer bread or crackers when ordering a cheese or charcuterie board. Since when can't a diner get a carb with their meat and cheese plate??   I used to love coming to this place and settling in with a bottle of wine noming on sushi, apps and salads. That was back when it was , three's , then press and then who knows. Let's just put it this way, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I won't be returning. This restaurant location can't keep a place in business. The salads were fine, but my coworker found a crumpled up carbon copy of a receipt in her salad. gross. management didn't know how to handle it appropriately."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night! Molly is a great bartender that offered many suggestions! The signature sushi roll was delicious! Andy the GM was very personable and we had a great time! We will definitely make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. Food was ok. Not worth a 2 hour wait for it though. Disappointing for my first night out away from my son."}
{"text":"Alright so the duck wings were what gave them a 4th star. Really great flavor. Crab cakes were ok but maybe change the sauce. Pork shank was ok too."}
{"text":"My cousin and I went to this place on Friday. I had a $25 off coupon on a $50 bill that I got from Restaurant.com- which I am so grateful I had. The atmosphere was great, they have an outside patio where they have live music and ample amounts of comfortable seating. We ordered the crab cakes, steak and frites (that's spelled correctly btw), egg rolls and mushroom crostini."}
{"text":"I wanted to love The Mandrake, I truly did.  But there were enough negatives to make me only like it, and probably not go back.  1) Décor was lovely - intimate lighting, good layout, friendly vibe.  The only negative: Our table had a slightly intimidating plant next to it that hung over my head while we ate.  Also, for a place that has tapas, I think they need bigger tables for tables of 2.  Our table had not an inch to spare once our four dishes arrived to the table.  2) Staff was decent - our waitress was nice but seemed kind of out of it.  We asked what dish she recommended and it took her a couple minutes to come up with something.  My husband thought maybe she was new and didn't know the menu that well.  She was attentive to our drinks and kept my water glass full, which I appreciated since...  3) The lobster mac and cheese was like eating a salt lick.  WAY too salty.  To the point of being unenjoyable.  We finally just dug out all the lobster and left the pasta behind because the salt quotient was much less on the lobster, but extremely high on the mac and cheese.  4) The lamb meatballs were a big disappointment.  We actually thought they had brought the wrong thing to our table, and checked with the waitress.  She confirmed it was the meatballs, and my husband said, \"It tastes more like a falafel than a lamb meatball.\"  As a big fan of lamb, I can attest to the fact it tasted NOTHING like lamb.  And nothing like meat. She went into the kitchen and confirmed with the chef that it was lamb meatballs (I'm sure he loved that).  5) The other dishes we got were great - we got the duck, which was delicious.  And the starch served with the duck was outstanding - easily the best dish we had that night.  We also got the pork bellies which were more like mini ribs than real pork bellies, but were delicious nonetheless.  I got the French onion soup which was great.  6) Drink prices were good on the night we went - my husband got two beers for the same price as my one cocktail because they were running a special on the beer tap.  Overall, it's not a place I'd recommend, and it's not a place I'd return to, but it was a decent (but not great) meal during our night out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The ambiance is lovely, and good for every occasion. The drinks are great and with something to cater to every taste.  Great wine selection! I highly recommend the Moscow mule there with a twist it has habanero bitters which make it spicy but not over powering and still refreshing! For the food... Man, where to start? I LOVE The bruschetta with the goat cheese and mushrooms so good! I also love the sushi with jalapeños super fresh fish and the chef knows what he is doing! I also really liked the lamb meatballs and the flatbreads! For dessert I recommend the chocolate cake and the red velvet cheesecake with Oreo crust! I mean is this real life, red velvet, Oreo crust and cheesecake all in one!! Yes!!!!"}
{"text":"Their brunch hours are 11-4 and they have bottomless mimosas for $17. I believe they are also working on a Bloody Mary bar for you tomato juice fans. I had steak and eggs and the white chocolate French toast. The food came out quick and hot and the taste was amazing. This place is off the beaten path of the other restaurants and opened a little over a year ago. You can normally get a seat rather quickly, but it doesn't hurt to call ahead."}
{"text":"I've always been told, start with the good, tell the bad and then end good when giving negative feedback, so let's try it...  The good, ambience and location...  The bad, where to even begin.  Guess to start, trying to make a reservation for six.  Even though they say they use OpenTable, their availability is non existent on there, no matter what day you choose.  On a Saturday night we thought, well let's just risk going, well the lack of availability sure was not because they were busy, there were about 12 people, most at the outdoor tables.  Next, getting seated, of course they ask if we have reservations, which I responded, no, but the return of attitude was glaring, almost if I had inconvenienced the hostess from her ever too important conversation with a coworker.  Getting seated we glanced at the drink menu and started to look through the plates (it is Tapas after all).  Then came the delay....after about 15 minutes we were re-greeted and drinks were ordered.  More downtime to study...and practically memorize the menu.  Drinks finally start to come about 15 minute after that...but emphasize start, one...at...a...time, at a duration span of about 10 minutes.  After everyone got there drinks we felt maybe we crossed the hump and well on our way for some plates...  We order, 11 plates in all to share from the well memorized menu at this point, 4 cold and 7 hot; figuring the cold would be quick and we could start sharing after a long intro to the meal.  The first dish came out about 10 minutes later, the smallest plate of tuna tartare that I've ever seen.  Yes, it's tapas, but it was almost insulting to see the delivery, it was not destined for sharing like tapas, it was destined for one small mouthful.  Unfortunately the first dish was only the start of underwhelming dishes that came out in spans of about 10 minutes a piece.  Again, understanding tapas is about sharing and enjoying dishes together, the pace was not just inconvenient it was profoundly disappointing.  The dishes, included the likes of a bit too over dressed beet salad, mussels which lacked depth (highlight was the coconut milk), a bowl of hummus with a small handful of chips that in no normal society would be enough to even finish half of its accompaniment and lobster mac and cheese which fell flat and a ginger duck which had no ginger flavor and was served over a rather bland, pile of muck or was it risotto, couldn't tell.  The best dishes, well at least in comparison to all the rest of lack luster dishes, were the surf and turf sushi roll and the calamari.  Neither of which were above the ranks of local restaurants that pride themselves in inspiring dining.  Unfortunately the dishes and utter waste of 3 hours of my life didn't end the disappointment.  The night concluded with the bill, of which everything except the alcohol was double charged.  Up to this point the poor service might be passed to a poor performing kitchen or bar area (or both in this case) but any server could have spotted this quickly.  The bill was over $350 for six people with 9 drinks and 11 dishes that were all on average $12 a piece (20 x 12 = $240).  Any server should have caught that quickly but it took a conversation and a 10 minute wait to get it corrected.  Thinking at this point the payment would be quick now that we had a good bill, the bill stood lonely on our table with three credit cards in it waiting to be taken for 10 minutes...finally we felt sorry for it and brought it to the hostess stand.  I am one to understand that all restaurants have an off night with something, but this was close to an overall disaster.  And leaving we may have finally caught a glimpse at why...the servers were all relaxing and enjoying some food.  As promised, always end with a good, I'm glad that I got to spend three hours with my friends, despite the poor performance of the restaurant, the time spent and the memories formed (I mean I doubt we will ever forget this experience) outweigh everything else, so with that, thank you to Mandrake for giving us a venue that was close to the condo to have this evening with each other."}
