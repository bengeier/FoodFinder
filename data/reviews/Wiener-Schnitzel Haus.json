{"text":"Family-owned and operated piece of Austrian heaven.  The food is traditional and authentic fare, delightful and tasty.  Portions are generous.  The atmosphere is friendly, and the restaurant is small but very functional. I go there every chance I get when I am in Calgary. Small but well selected beer menu."}
{"text":"My son and I went here for lunch today around 1:00pm , had the schnitzel chips DELICIOUS, then we ordered 1/2 dozen Raw oysters SUPERB! And finally the pork hock with mixed veggies and purple sauerkraut AMAZING!!! Along with a stellar atmosphere and awesome service having lunch here was an experience I am going to enjoy over and over ! Thank you Würst Überhaus !!!!!!! 
Also fantastic beer that can be drank out of a traditional 1 litre stein or 2 litre glass boot :)"}
{"text":"A new favorite!  My son and I are always on the hunt for new great places to eat and we were so happy to find another good one to add to our short list.  My 7-year old son loved the Mac and cheese - very cheesy!  I had the bacon schnitzel with sauerkraut.  Will definitely have this again!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal at the Wiener Schnitzel Haus and had great service. Menu is very limited beyond wiener schnitzel so check out your options before going if you don't want schnitzel. Try the Baron beer. It goes great with the schnitzel. Reservations are recommended as seating is limited."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I can't wait to go back. I've had the traditional wiener-schnitzel always with spatzle (it's the greatest!), I've also had the pear and brie schnitzel which is also very very very good. The vegetables are always cooked to perfection, as is the schnitzel and spatzle (German dumpling pasta). I have gone here multiple times with one other person and I've also been here with a group of 6. They are such friendly staff and the food is amazing! It's a small restaurant so you may want to make reservations."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. Very friendly people with excellent schnitzels.  Definitely need reservations."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but very overpriced and portion sizes are some of the smallest I've experienced anywhere.  Everyone left ticked off at paying so much to still be so hungry."}
{"text":"We went to the Wiener Schnitzel Haus for a dinner. It is very small so reservations are recommended. It doesn't look like much from the outside. The schnitzel is amazing. Not heavy or greasy and there are many different flavours to choose from. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food was good, in fact it was very good. However, the size of the portions does not warrant the high prices. This is comfort food at best, not fine dining. 
Having been to Germany and Austria many times, I can tell you without a doubt that the food is truly authentic. However, the portion sizes are extremely small in comparison of what you would get at a gasthaus in Europe.
Therefore either portion sizes need to be increased to justify the cost, or the side dishes need to be included. Having grown up on this type of food made by my Oma, she would roll over in her grave if she knew how much this restaurant charges for a side order of Rotkohl (red cabbage): $9.00 for one cup of cabbage. I'm sorry but that is robbery.
Yes the food is good. Unfortunately, you are going to pay thru the nose to experience it.
Sadly, we will not be going back to this restaurant. I cannot justify taking out a second mortgage to eat what amounts to peasant food. It is good, but not that good.

Shame on you, Wiener Schnitzel Haus, shame."}
{"text":"We were there celebrating my Mom's birthday on a Saturday night. It was quite busy and boisterous but not to the point whew we couldn't have a nice conversation. Our server was knowledgable and attentive. The food was superb. Very authentic in all respects and able to be served gluten free for a selection of options. Will definitely be reserving a table for another family get together."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. The service is outstanding, if a restaurant could be \" a home away from home \" then this would be mine. Perfect dinner, take your time and enjoy."}
{"text":"My brother chose Weiner-Schnitzel Haus for our family get together, which is only a group of 5, so we had no trouble fitting in this small restaurant! My husband is from Australia where \"chicken schnitty's\" are a regular meal, so we were both looking forward to some homemade schnitzel. 

What I wasn't expecting were the amazing toppings and fillings that were available, as I am not familiar with authentic Austrian cuisine. Everyone's meal was fantastic, I had the farmers schnitzel, filled with ham and cheese, and my husband had a pork schnitzel stuffed with brie and pear, both were excellent. Even my vegetarian Aunt was happily looked after with her Mushroom Spatzle and a big salad. The side salads were actually a highlight for everyone, they had a serving of four different kinds of salad, (all delicious) with a little butter lettuce rosette in the center, beautifully presented!

Our desserts were all excellent as well, accompanied by french press coffee.

Highly recommend this little gem and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a reservation but had to wait for 20mins. Food was really good. Appreciate the previous review on the appetizer"}
{"text":"Food is good but the owners are a little weird. First time I came by a friend at the table wanted to snap a quick picture of the dish he was served and put it on Facebook. She (one of the owners) came over and interrupted him saying there are plenty of pictures of their food on the website and not to take pictures in the restaurant. The second time I went with my aunt and we had slow service. The staff on hand was clearly interested in servicing the table beside us because they were ordering all sorts of upsells such as beer. Then when we went to pay it took forever and then finally they said they had no change so we left without tipping. Aside from the bizarre service this place is ok but it isn't mind blowing as far as the food goes. There are other places for German / Austrian food that offer much more of an experience and quality of food."}
{"text":"My bf and I went here last night for the very first time and had some mixed feelings about the whole thing. When we walked in I was a little taken back as to how small the place was but I absolutely LOVE that it's family owned. Here was our only bump in the road while we were there, the waitress (Mum) came by to ask us what we would like to drink and I wasn't sure if I felt like a glass of wine or not (which is strange because I'm usually always in a wine mood) so she gave me a taste of the wine and after I sipped it I decided that I didn't want wine so I said \"I don't think I'll have wine tonight\" and before I could say another word she went \"Oh\" and grabbed both of our wine glasses and walked away. I fully expected that she would put the wine glasses down and come back to take our drink order so when she put the glasses down and then visited every other table before finally coming back to us to ask us what we wanted to drink again, I was floored. I was ready to leave. I felt that she had done this because we are a younger couple and we weren't dressed as fancy as some of the other people there (but by no means did we look sloppy or anything) so maybe she felt that we deserved less. It was like she was insulted I didn't want wine. I asked my bf if he wanted to leave (he was just as annoyed as I was) but he was hungry so we decided to stay. So she comes back and takes our drink order (I opted for the Cafe Sissy and it was WONDERFUL but very small) and my bf had a beer. When our food came.... any hard feelings we had went out the window. I've never had veal before, but that is definitely the way it's supposed to be cooked!! I had the Jager Schnitzel (Veal loaded with mushrooms and a sherry sauce) and it was AMAZING! The sauce they had it in, they could bottle and sell it. He had the Haus Schnitzel which is almost identical to a cordon bleu and it was just as good... even the french fries he got with them tasted wonderful. Even though we were a little miffed with the service we'll definitely be back. I love to support local place and the food was too good to let the service ruin it. It was probably a one off anyways. I would definitely recommend making a reservation, even if you only call 30 mins before you get there. There are only a handful of tables and it fills up quick. Definitely recommend Wiener-Schnitzel Haus."}
{"text":"Was looking  forward to German food and especially spaetzel, but the staff was rude and I suspect they aren't fond of people with kids."}
{"text":"I'd been looking for a good schnitzel for a long time and came across this highly reviewed restaurant on a biz trip to Calgary. It was close to my hotel so I took the plunge.

Tried the Tiroler Schnitzel which is emmental cheese filled and topped with air dried bacon. Although the schnitzel was good, the veggies really rounded the dish. Combined with the sauce the variety of taste from the asparagus, zucchini, tomatoes, mushrooms provided an interesting experience and mildly surprised you with a pop of taste each round. Each vegetable stood out.

The applestrudel with vanilla cream and lingonberry sauce was good but again, the accompaniment of the Einspanner completed the dish. Both were mildly but adequately flavored to give a good finishing touch to the meal. I was surprised by the smoothness of the Einspanner espresso as I've had so many just bitter espresso's before.

Sure glad it was my last meal on this trip."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a chicken schnitzel and alpen
Schnitzel, Austrian salads, extra red cabbage and apple strudel for dessert.  With the meal I had a Konig Ludwig
weissbier (which I am very familiar with).  The schnitzels were outstanding however my wife's portion was larger which isn't a big deal but it made me want mine to be bigger.  Actually in comparison to other German restaurants I've been to the portions weren't as generous.  For that reason and the price tag of our dinner I knocked a star off.  We were full but for our meals then a tip we were up to $80 for two people.  We're no stranger to expensive meals but for a meal my wife didn't love and I've felt like I've had better, that's a little too much in my opinion.  I would recommend anyone try it for themselves."}
{"text":"Great to have a small independent restaurant locally. This place has been around for more than ten years. That's a remarkable feat for a small restaurant. We had the Pretzel and Mushrooms for starters. The pretzel was tasty, a little small for $8, the mushrooms were deep fried and took me back to 1980s cuisine. Still, they were juicy.  I ordered a prosecco cocktail, and it was too sugary for me and barely drinkable.  The glass of wine my husband ordered was good (Mark West Pinot Noir) and well price. 
We had three different schnitzels each costing a little over $25. They apparently came served with fries or salad.
I ordered the Parisian Schnitzel.  It was a generously sized schnitzel stuffed with a modest amount of brie and tasteless slices of fresh pear.  Served with a tablespoon of tasty slaw and generic frozen fries served in an attractive bowl. My son and husband's schnitzel had similarly modest stuffings and were uninteresting. 
The service was efficient, with only two staff waiting on the whole restaurant. I wanted a glass of wine after my cocktail was done, but I wasn't able to get the waitress attention. Similarly, I wanted salt, but I had to resort to the 'diner solution' of taking salt off an empty table. The food was served as fast a MacDonalds. It made me think that there is a business opportunity to open a fast food schnitzel haus. 
Unfortunatly  when the bill arrived there was a charge of $9 that we thought erroneous. We had all ordered from the section \"Served with salad or fries.\" My son had ordered and said \"and salad\" as we each made our orders. Apparently, his schnitzel, though coming in the section under the \"served with\" did not come 'with' so his side salad was $9. I felt that we should not have to pay. The woman serving us (she was also management, I was told) was very displeased, and an argument ensued. Until we left, she didn't stop dropping one line provocations my way \"You can't read a menu,\" \"Lady, I did not invite you here\". Perhaps it is a sign that they don't have experience dealing with 'complaints.' That would be a good indication. 
Overall a disappointing evening for us. If you love meat, you might enjoy the ambience with a glass of wine or beer and a generous portion of meat."}
{"text":"This is a nice, small family business. They offer authentic Austrian food and make most of the food from scratch. We had a cheese and meat platter for two to start with, the food on there was good but it wasn't a lot, especially regarding the price. Same with the other two dishes we had, small portions for a high price. The schnitzel don't come with a lot of sides so you have to order them separately. The gulasch soup was so over seasoned with cinnamon that I couldn't eat the whole small bowl, and I was small.   
This is a bit hard for me to review because the food is quite good, you just don't get a lot compared to what you pay for it, which is too bad. I've been to several restaurants in Austria and always got pretty decent portions."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Austrian German food and having traveled around Germany and Austria, I think this place is very authentic in the food it serves. The goulash soup was very very good, homemade, meaty and flavorful. Jager schnitzel was also a star dish on our table. The chicken schnitzel was massive so I didn't finish it. Side dishes are good as well although a little pricey for the portion. Then we finished it off with the apfelstrudle which was also excellent. Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"they have GREAT schnitzel here - haven't had any this good outside vienna! comes with really good side salad too... and not just greens with dressing, but a nice variety of different veggies like you would find in austria!"}
{"text":"Did the take out. Was so disappointed at the amount of food we got, for the price that we had paid. Will not be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Have been coming here for years and it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"I keep going back here because the food is really good. The service however is lacking, considering how small the restaurant is. Two people should be able to work this room quite easily. This is not Europe, people don't like to sit forever waiting for more wine, or to pay their tab. After finishing our dessert and coffee, we sat with our dishes in front of us for close to 30 mins. I finally waved someone down and asked 'what happened to our waitress?', only to receive a snippy attitude for even mentioning it.

We'd eaten here about 2-3 times and thought that weinerschnitzel was veal but apparently at this place it pork. Likely because it's cheaper. Again, we received another snippy attitude because my elderly German MIL said that she usually thought it was veal. \"WELL IT'S NOT!\" the owner yelled at us. 

I'd rate it a 5 if the service was always spot on, but that hasn't been my experience. The food itself is a 5!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I wanted to have German for Valentine's Day! I looked on Yelp and found Wiener schnitchiel house. the service was fantastic, so friendly! The food was amazing! Thank you for a fantastic Valentines!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and I'm a fan. Service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"What a welcome alternative of cuisine this was for us!
Amazing where life takes you at times. We found ourselves in the area without a vehicle thanks to ours getting a flat tire today. Too icy to walk around where we ended up so a business across the road had recommended this restaurant to us. Upon looking at it, one could be quite certain due to its name that it is something similar to German but you would not know how quaint it is inside until you go in!
It was not too busy initially but almost a full house it was when we left. That has got to say something!
This is a family run business with the emphasis on Austrian food. Normally, I would not choose to come here unless invited as I usually love my food to be bold, spicy and in your face. But, fate ruled, this is where we ate and I am so glad for it!
The owner was our server and host - she could not have been more kind, welcoming, thoughtful or intuitive of our needs.
Wine was needed on a this hectic day and the house red (Castillo) was fantastic at $10 a glass. We had to take a cab home so what the hell, I had 2 glasses. Hubby had Dab, an Austrian beer that he had never had before and loved it, said it was nice and light.
We ordered the Haus schnitzel with fries for him ($24) and I got the traditional wiener schnitzel ($21). Mine, pounded ever so thin was larger than the plate (pic to follow!) and I got fries and salad served on the side. Man, the food was good here. I can never eat a whole plate of food, but I did on this date! The fries were perfectly golden and the salad was interesting in a good way. Purple cabbage, potato salad with dill, lettuce, coleslaw, cukes, all in one little bowl. The pork schnitzel was so good with lemon wedges. The breading is very simple, just bread crumbs (the meat is seasoned, not the breadcrumbs), but done right. All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked SO good! Hubby`s pork was not quite as pounded out as mine and was stuffed with Swiss cheese, ham and fresh mushrooms!
The water for the table (no charge!) had an herbal flavour to it - it was like a basil or mint leaf in it, something like that.
I love family run businesses and this place was just so out of the ordinary for us, it was a welcome change! 
We opted to not have dessert but we devoured the little Swiss chocolates that came before the bill! The owner even called our cab for us!
4.5 stars. I would change the music in here but that is about it!"}
{"text":"Finally; a place that sells true Austrian-style schnitzel; that means butterflied, pounded flat, with flaky light, puffy breading.  None of this thick juicy stuff here.  The spatzle is authentic as well.  

Also had the kalt plasse which I can wholeheartedly recommend; having a nice assortment of dried meats and cheeses in typical German style.  

Very cozy, great service. Prices are a bit higher, but well worth it."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for dinner as schnitzel really sounded good and something different.  The food was really good, but the service was pretty lackluster - it was somewhat of a bother for the 2 tables that were occupied.  Hopefully the service picks up when the crowds do too because the food is definitely worth a visit.  I thoroughly enjoyed my haus schnitzel and my husband did as well."}
{"text":"Really bad experience, food is way overpriced and the entrées are so small you would think they were appetizers. Won't be back, Das Wirtshaus is way better!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, incredible food and a lovely atmosphere overall. It took a couple of attempts to get our schedules to line-up with a reservation time, but it was well worth the effort. We will DEFINITELY go again."}
{"text":"It was a very nice experience at this restaurant. We found it randomly while looking for directions to somewhere else on google maps of all places!

Perfect breaded schnitzel in the European tradition, a very nice Austrian beer, and wonderful apple strudel with vanilla sauce rounded out what was an excellent dinner. The food was amazing, but I deducted one star for the slow service. Don't get me wrong, they were perfectly nice and it was a great dining environment, but it was just a bit slower from what I was used to. Then again it is a family owned establishment and maybe I'm just used to dining at chains where they want a quick turnover.

I don't understand what other reviewers said about small portion sizes. I thought the portion size was more than adequate and I was very full after eating. The portions seem pretty standard, but then again I also don't frequent \"all you can eat\" type places so I perhaps have a different experience/outlook than other people do. Fair enough.

Make sure you make reservations if you go because it is a very small location. Seems like a lot of regulars go there. They also do not take AMEX. Only Visa, MC, debit or Cash."}
{"text":"Warm, friendly, attentive service. My first time in years to have schnitzel, glad to try the Parisian schnitzel stuffed with Brie and fresh pear, and Apfel streudel for dessert."}
{"text":"We went to Wiener-Schnitzel Haus tonight for a date night and we couldn't have been happier.  The restaurant is very small so I would highly suggest phoning ahead and making a reservation or just stopping by for take out.  The decor is quite nice with a fairly modern feel and a nice open kitchen layout so you can watch your meal being created.

The menu has many options for carnivores but if you're a veggie I would avoid it as there really isn't much for you.  There are 2 sets of options traditional breaded and fried schnitzels with either fries or salads, or panfried schnitzels  all with some kind of sauce served with spetzle and veggies.

For dessert there are limited options, a home made apple strudel which was completely amazing and a vanilla cake with meringue."}

{"text":"Go enjoy this authentic Austrian family restaurant for a date, or quiet family dinner, but don't tell anyone else about it! 
Let's hide this gem for ourselves :))

suffices to say... One of my best dining experiences in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I love schnitzel and spaetzle and this tiny spot does a great job. Each time I go, I try something new. I think I like the breaded style best. Worth the trip to Montgomery."}
{"text":"Food is decent enough; crispy outside and moist contents, but definitely not phenomenal like the chef thinks they are. The portions are small. The price is just ridiculous - 24+ dollars for a decently fried meat? Come on...
Spend your well earned money somewhere better"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my wife and parents. Really enjoyed the experience. Food was great and Vera, the waitress was fantastic. (That's why the 5 stars.)
We arrived at 4 after driving down from Lake Louise. The place is small but since we were the only ones there, it was perfect. 
We had various schnitzels and the salads were delicious. Had some Austrian beer that set the tone.
This is the kind of place you like to find on Yelp. This was our last stop in Canada and it made the end a great last meal."}
{"text":"Great staff. Great food. As a visitor to Calgary, it was the perfect way to start our trip. Our server had wonderful recommendations for food, drink and things to do in Calgary. We felt welcome and happy."}
{"text":"Only schnitzel but they do this very well. And there is a large variety. Lovely fresh vegetables. Much better than I was expecting. Not heavy stodgy cuisine that one might expect from an Austrian style eatery."}
{"text":"Went to Wiener Schnitzel Haus for Valentine's Day.   I've heard it is hard to get in, and the hours are quite unpredictable, so we made sure to get a reservation.

It is a very tight space, but well laid out.  Upon walking to our table, it was amazing to see the fresh ingredients in the open kitchen.  Looked like a little European kitchen.

We ordered the Kalt Plasse which was a really yummy appetizer of dried meats (smoked prosciutto, salami) and cheeses.    They had many Austrian beers to accompany it.

Main course we went for the traditional schnitzel, which was excatly how schnitzel should be made (not that thick, juicy crap that other places market as schnitzel), I ordered fries but wished I had ordered the salad.    Everything was extremely tasty. 

Service was great, and we got strawberries and starfruit as a Valentine's Day surprise.   

Cozy, awesome service, and authentic schnitzel.   :)"}
