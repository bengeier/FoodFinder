{"text":"It took my BF and I a long time to finally give Gratitude a try after reading poor reviews of the staff and were very surprised at the decent experience we had. The food was great. I had the quesadilla and my BF had the calzone - both were wonderful and hearty. The atmosphere is a little weird, especially if you're seated by the huge windows or the drafty door and the bigger meals take a very long time but it's worth it. Though I wish the dishes weren't named things like \"I am Grateful\", it's awkward to order.."}
{"text":"Dear Gratitude Cafe,  You suck....literally.  I do apologize in being so blatant, but it's the truth, and like they say, \"you should hear nothing but the truth.\"    Usually I write more polite reviews, but I'm saving a more personal one just for you!   Although I don't have any real complaints in the food, I have real complaints about the service.  Usually I'm not a snob about customer service, but good gosh dude, treat your customers with care!  One particular server was bitchy enough to try and rip my friend and I off, while at the same time trying to shove us out the door so she could take her break.  Courteous much??? VERY!!!...and that was a sarcastic joke.  On today's and last visit, you were pressuring me and my friend to order as soon as we could.  I'm sorry but with the rather weird titles of \"I am Hungry\" or \"I am very Hungry\" just made it all more confusing for me to look at the menu.  Okay, maybe I'm just really dumb - but give us a few minutes to mull over the menu rather than stand at our table and stare at us as we're trying to decide in a panic.  So after you take our orders, you just have to make fun of the short Asian kid (me) - I know I'm short but you're not exactly tall either missy!  However I thank you for giving me my \"I am boozy\" alcohol drink - I really needed it after you pissed me off.  Because the food is tasty, you earn two stars - too bad the service sucks.  So if you ever read this, I do highly recommend that you learn how to have better customer service.  Maybe you'll gain a better review in the future.  To other viewers, go for the food but be prepared for crappy/crabby service.  Sincerely,   A very pissed off vegetarian customer who went to Gratitude Cafe"}
{"text":"Wow!  Absolutely wonderful restaurant even if you aren't vegan!  The restaurant is very calming with a zen-like feel.  I had the potato-lentil curry soup and the green salad.  Soup was scrumptious and I was able to choose  the ingredients I wanted in my salad using a \"check list.\"  It was prepared exactly as I desired!  The ginger-lime rooibos mojito (non-alcoholic) was divine and garnished with fresh berries.  I personally am happy to spend a little more $ in order to have my food fresh, organic, and local when available.  The owner is a hoot and does all the buying, preparing, helps to serve."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to give this place 3 stars, but I think that is pretty good given the service. The food I ate here was really delicious, and they had a menu full of options that had me salivating! However, the service is severely lacking. I arrived for an early lunch on a Sunday when no one else was yet in the restaurant. Initially my server was very friendly. She and another girl that were working we chatting very loudly, and when I was served my food I double checked that it was vegan (since they do not specify what is, but what they can make, vegan. The girl that brought it out very loudly and rudely told me that it is always vegan. At this point, there were a few more tables occupied. Even as the restaurant started to get a little busier, the 2 girls chatted loudly and even did so when they were across the restaurant from each other! At one point someone stepped in, then left, and the girl behind the counter, yelled, \"Come back in here!\"  I really liked the table I had and had hoped I could order a little more and enjoy people watching, and ignoring the servers' discussion while in my own little world, but my server seemed like she was in a rush to get me out and started treating me coldly. The food was great, I had a great seat by the window and could people watch, the restaurant is pretty neat, but the service is terrible.   You would think all of these terrible reviews would get them to reconsider their service. Their business would probably escalate substantially! Personally, if I lived here I would boycott them until they improved. The money they charge for their food is not worth the service."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! If you don't usually go for the vegetarian options, try the quesadilla or burrito. The soup & sandwich is amazing for lunch, you don't even think about the fact that it's all veggies. So delicious & really filling! It's a bit pricey, but so healthy & surprisingly good"}
{"text":"It was my first visit - and my last. Hostile behaviour from service staff persists. Food was good, not amazing."}
{"text":"I recently gave Gratitude another shot while a gluten-free friend and I were near starving in Kensington. The service had improved so much that I felt my review needed an update. Both my friend and I were pleasantly surprised by the total turnaround: friendly service, delicious organic wine, and some pretty tasty raw deserts."}
{"text":"Myself and a couple of friends got the vegan pizza , which I must say was executed pretty well . Oddly enough , the food would not be the biggest topic of disscusion but rather the staff . The only way I can describe our experience at the graditutde cafe,was as Seinfeldian . It all began with a stink eye from the waitress , which was bizzare because the last time I witnessed a stink eye was when the Van Buren boys hassled Kramer. Furthermore we were quite polite ..... dare I say charming , so who knows what triggered the stink eye. However the stink eye was only the begining , as the service did not get any better.  In conclusion, forget the food and release your inner Sociologist  as this place has some of weirdest social dynamics out there. Stay long enough , and you may have enough material for your own sitcom."}
{"text":"Unlike some of the posters, I've always had pleasant experiences at this place when I lived in Calgary and when I go back each year to see family. It is one of the few vegan places in Calgary. I wouldn't say the food is anything spectacular but it is good and served pretty quickly even during dinnertime."}
{"text":"Good: - Very good veggie/vegan food, filling, lots of choices  Bad: - I've been twice. One time the waitress was downright hostile. It was unwarranted; we came in, ordered food and played chess. I only went back because a different friend insisted. The second time my waitress was awesome. If next time I go the waitress isn't out for blood, I may increase my review. - A bit pricey for some of the dishes.  Overall: One of the few veggie/vegan choices in the city, but be weary that you may be harassed for giving them business..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and love thw food! However, the place has a Soup Nazi like atmosphere. The owner runs a tight ship and you need to follow the rules. For example - The food is all made to order and they wont take your food order until it is your turn in the queue. Also, there is a note on the menu qbout a $5 charge for being a rude customer. At first I thought that was a joke, but am pretty sure it isnt now.  I find all of it part of the experience of eating there. They are closing June 1 so try it while you can!"}
{"text":"I signed up for yelp just so I could leave a review.   The WORST attitude I've ever experienced in my life.   Not only would I recommend that you not go there, I would also suggest that if you are an anger management therapist that you pay a visit to the staff."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The manager seems to always be in an impatient, snarky mood, from what I've also heard from others as well. It was a great idea to have such a restaurant right in the heart of Kensington, but I will never go back there."}
{"text":"If you ask anyone in Calgary about a great vegetarian place in Calgary, nine times out of ten, they'll tell you about The Coup.  But why go there when you can go to the Gratitude Cafe and not have to wait in line.  I'm not a vegetarian but I still like going every now and then.  For me, it is the equivalent of cleanse.   The portions at the gratitude cafe are huge, which I never expect from a veggie place. This time I got the quesadillas and the server gave me this board with about 25 ingredients.  She let me choose exactly how many I want without any limit.  So if you are really hungry, you can pack your food full of as many ingredients as you want.  You definitely end up getting your moneys worth.  Be warned, it is one of those places that has flexible hours, so if they feel like they closing, they'll just close.  So if you are thinking of going later in the evening make sure you call ahead.  They are also usually out of their specials by the time the sun starts setting, so chances are you'll be stuck to the menu which is just find.   All the tables also have lots of boardgames to play while you are waiting for you food.  I'm not terrified of germs, but this was a little too much for me, I'd rather not touch used board games that people played while they were eating their food.  Maybe that is just me...."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, this restaurant should have been completely up my street. I went with the sister (not vegetarian) for lunch. The menu was a bit strange, each dish was named after an exclamation and ranked by hunger. I got the pecan portobello mushroom burger and sister got the daily soup and hummus bruschetta. We didn't wait too long but we kept hearing the kitchen staff shouting, and while the games on the table kinda distracted us, I can't imagine this being a nice intimate dinner environment. When my burger arrived, it was completely different to what I had imagined, it was not a burger but more like a sandwich. There was no patty instead there were salty portbello mushroom slices, which made it super messy to eat with my hands. The burger was nicely balanced with the hummus and sprouts guacamole, so overall it was ok. My sister's soup was kind of lack luster and the bruschetta toast was over toasted. When I went to the washroom, I was a bit taken back by the wall to wall graffiti, but it was clean. I think I'll only come back if a friend wants to try it, but I won't willingly be back alone."}
{"text":"We were visiting Calgary and were told to check out 10th Street in Kensington for its great restaurants. We were not dissapointed.  The menu was a little confusing, not to mention illegible but it stood out with sub-headings such as \"I am hungry\" and \"I am very hungry\" and dishes with informative titles like \"I am appreciated\" and \"I am creating\".   We both ordered from the \"I am very hungry\" menu which meant that we were able to choose as many vegetables from their vegetable board by colouring in the heart next to the choices with a marker.   Gimmicks aside, we both really enjoyed our meals, mine a Calzone and my friends the Taco Salad. The Calzone was freshly prepared and absolutely delicious, straight out of the oven. My friends Taco Salad with literally the lot, was huge and also delicious.  The only complaint was that the service was very slow and the waitress was not able to answer my questions about the beer menu nor was she able to explain some of the choices on the menu.  I fully recommend this restaurant, particularly if you are vegetarian!"}
{"text":"i was excited to come here while visiting alberta as raw vegan options in cowtown just seem so unlikely!  but i was super nervous bringing people as there are so many negative reviews! i really hope reviews from 2009 and 2010 don't keep people from trying this place for the first time or for a second or third :) we arrived to an empty, pre-dinner rush restaurant and were quickly acknowledged. i wasn't expecting the modern and clean design after reading the reviews which made me picture some shabby-chic, disorganized, stressful place. the people i was with weren't sure they wanted to sit down but thankfully i convinced them :) we were told about a raw platter special ($22) that ended up being perfect (and portioned for the 3 of us!) to share.  it came so quick, i don't even remember waiting. it was like we called ahead! super fresh and inspiring with so many complimenting tastes and textures. we enjoyed everything! then we decided to share a delicious raw cheesecake that came with, conveniently, 3 gooseberries as garnish for us to share. and again, even though there were several other tables by this point, our service was so quick and attentive, we figured we had time to enjoy a latte as well. we ended up ordering 2 and they spit them into 3 mugs which was so nice.  we felt like we stayed forever but had everything within an hour and 15 minutes (and that's with at least 20 minutes at the end when we were just talking and drinking the most-enjoyable reverse-osmosis water - i don't care that dasani bottles their water here in alberta! it's still gross to me!)  so, yes, we had low expectations and expected to be treated poorly but really, that isn't why we had such an enjoyable experience.  i figure this cafe was started with really great intentions but perhaps had no idea about customer service...at first. but they must have seen all of the reviews and made some changes to ensure that the early \"kinks\" (which, yes, sound very seinfeld-ian) have been worked out. we were acknowledged quickly and attentively, service was friendly and extremely quick, prices were reasonable and questions were answered with no hesitations. i really hope that people continue to enjoy this place so that it thrives. i joined yelp so that i could write this review as i search places like this out when i go travelling. raw, vegan and organic foods are very important to me and it's extremely exciting to see them being prepared in calgary, alberta!  and...i am grateful for this! ^_^"}
{"text":"Just about coming up on their one year anniversary, Gratitude Cafe has been serving vegan, organic, raw and gluten free food in Calgary since May 2009.  Conveniently located in Kensington, Gratitude Cafe serves everything from pancakes, waffles and crepes, all the way to sushi, lasagna and curry.  It definitely has the 'hippy' feel to it.  The prices are pretty typical for a Kensington restaurant and the crowd is made up of new faces and regulars alike.  The service is good and the best part is that you leave feeling full, satisfied and completely free of 'unhealthy eating' regret."}
{"text":"I didn't actually sit down for food at this cafe, because of a very rude staff member (who I assume was the owner from the other posts I've read).  Thinking it was a cafe with coffee and a washroom, I walked in and tried to use the restroom and planned to order a coffee to go. The blonde girl stopped me in my tracks and said \"hi there\" in the most unfriendly \"what do you think you're doing\" kind of tone. I said I was on my way to the washroom, which led to her tearing a strip off of me and asking me \"where I came from\"??? and about how the washroom was for paying customers only, etc... never even letting me speak, I felt so berated.   I finally said I had planned to order something and she snarkily said I \"never told her that but since I was going to order something I could use their washroom\" YEAH RIGHT! It was embarrassing and she made me feel terrible - for trying to use her washroom!   This kind of hostility would be more suited to a prison guard than owner of a place called \"gratitude cafe\". I didn't buy a coffee from her and I will never go back there again in my life."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Arrived at 7pm to be rushed through dinner and be offered a selection of about a third of the items.  The waitress was very unfriendly but the most surprising part was that we were told she was the owner.  My wife and I have been vegetarian for quite some time and the quality of the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We wandered into Gratitude Cafe hoping to get a coffee and something sweet. We were all the way to the counter to order, when we finally realized this place had table service and was more of a dinner place. We felt ackward and wanted to leave but then the waitress insisted they had what we needed. She told us to come sit down (being that we were already on our way out). I felt like a sales person had met all my 'objections' and was pressuring me to stay.  We did sit and then were met with the fact that they were out of half of their deserts (2 out of 4!), and didn't have any other standard cafe baked treats. We left wishing we had continued over to Coffee House or Higher Ground afterall.  Our almond-milk hot chocolates were nice, whereas the banana split was somewhat unappetizing with it's browning banana slices and poor presentation."}
{"text":"Ooooo boy Gratitude. I really really wanted to like you.  Even though I did enjoy the food, I've thought it over and I can't justify giving more than one star. As many other reviews have mentioned, I will not be returning thanks to the awful service. There is no excuse for the level of rudeness here.  To start, my sister arrived early and waited at the door not knowing if she should seat herself as there is no sign indicating what to do. She ended up having to go up to the counter and ask if she was supposed to pick her own table to which the person replied in a less than pleasant tone \"you can sit anywhere... but no one is going to help you for awhile. We're really busy.\"  The actual dining experience was uneventful other than overhearing one of the waitresses making fun of a customer for asking what the healthier options are. Apparently \"it's all vegan... so it's all healthy\" is an acceptable answer? Except there is a obvious health difference between a vegan pizza and a salad.  The biggest issue occurred when we were ready to leave. Instead of bringing over a copy of the receipt, the waitress only brought the credit machine. When my mom said she preferred to have a detailed receipt before paying (which by the way they legally HAVE to give their customers if they request it), the waitress threw a tantrum about how she wasn't going to \"waste paper\". She actually made my mother get up and walk over to their computer to look at the details on the screen, all the while lecturing her about wasted paper. Not exactly the most professional way to close the deal and ensure a good tip (or any tip for that matter).  I get that you want to be eco-friendly. No one recycles more than I do. However, if a customer requests a receipt, you do it without question. No one wants to go to a restaurant to be berated by the staff."}
{"text":"I won't go on long as the other reviews say it all.   The food is not spectacular or anything near great, the service is REALLY bad - Once the waitress found out I was not vegan or vegetarian she gave me a nasty look and almost stopped waiting on my table. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!!  I cannot comment as per the other reviews on the service as I have only done take out twice.   The servers are 'abrupt' but I wouldn't say rude. Regardless, the food is fabulous; Day 1 I had the hummus bruschetta, the lentil curry soup and the mousse. ALL DIVINE!!!! especially the Bruschetta!  Day 2 I decided to give the Cafe a try again; this time I took a religious meat eater with me; she had a curry and I had the Pizza- I brought the left over Pizza back to work with me which was DEVOURED by my cooworkers.   Meat eaters and non meat / dairy eaters alike all came to the same Concensus... the PIZZA was divine!!!!  All of it was DIVINE!!!!  Not cheap but there definitely would be a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"I love the laid-back atmosphere of this restaurant I felt immediately upon entering as our waiter told us to sit wherever we'd like.  Being one of two vegan restaurants in Calgary I was very pleased with the choices for food. The actual food itself tasted amazing and was filled with flavourful ingredients. My favourite part of this visit was when our waitress asked me if I'd like cheese with my sandwich. I told her no I'm vegan and she asked me if nutritional yeast was all right. I said yes of course, and in my head I was thinking omg, they know me so well!  Can't wait to go back again! But I'll have to wait until my budget will allow it as the food is not cheap. Only because the food is made with the best ingredients though."}
{"text":"I have not had the service issues others here are describing...   not like it's ever been stellar,  but it's fine.   I'm a vegetarian and it's close to work so I do want to love it.  I find it good, on the expensive side for the class of food, great variety for different tastes.  Nothing overly special but I like the choice and the healthy focus of the food.   My guy is a carnivore leaning omnivore and it's a place HE pitches because he's quite happy there (even though he's going vegetarian that meal).   I believe he's even gone there once alone... which speaks to the quality.   The layout of the menu is a bit strange,  it's rated in order of hunger.  What's not clear, is that the really hungry (or something) section is entres and the less hungry section is appetizer size.  My appetite is not huge so I ordered from the hungry (but not really hungry) section and got a small appetizer (3 small bites).  This was of course not enough,  so I needed a second (adds to the bill big time because they are nearly the same price as entrees) and I was still hungry.   The really hungry section is filling but maybe not enough for a large appetite.  I'm really not sure this is the place to walk into if you're starving, because it will be a very expensive place to fuel up.  This is definitely not the same as the SF restaurant so if you've been there don't  expect the same kind of place (it's very different... and probably not as good)   I'm still happy to have this place in Kensington and I hope I don't see the infamous nasty side of the staff anytime soon."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer suggested that Gratitude Cafe had a hippie feel. I would say it is more of a yuppie modern feel. Not earthy, which is what veggie/vegan restaurants often are and is what I prefer, however I do recognize that many others prefer a modern clean feel .  The  vegan chili with cheese (my choice) I had was thick and filling and tasty. I only wanted stop by for a tea and read, but I felt pressured to order food. Lucky it was in fact dinner time.  When I visited Gratitude Cafe it had just opened. I would return, but it wouldn't be my first choice of Kensington restaurants."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Been twice. I will be back. The first visit is an experience. This place is not set up like any other conforming contemporary restaurant. There is wicker-style seating at the front as well as tables, bench seating and tighter, smaller tables and seating at the back. The space is not cut with clean angles either. You will know what I mean when you visit. The tables have games (snakes and ladders, etc.) and cards for your amusement - a nice diversion from the electronic/technological. The service is interesting and where most of the complaints are originating from. There is a particular hostess who can appear abrupt and sharp at first. If you give it some time you will find she is an interesting person with a dry sense of humor, a unique voice and delivery and some, it is obviously - given the comments, do not get her or don't want to get her. She is still there and she did a fine job on my second visit. The other servers are what you would expect and were awesome. The food is excellent, vegan style, organic, creative, tasty, well presented and delicious. Their cheesecake is like nothing else I have experienced. Be grateful and enjoy. You will likely not find a menu like this in most parts of the city. Wow! comes to mind. If you are looking for the full meal deal (lots of food, high calorie, free refills) this is not the place for you. The prices are not cheap - this is quality food and preparation and very healthy - you still get what you pay for. Of note, the kitchen starts to wind down and put limitations on the menu around or after 8 pm. What else - their wine list is small and I thought expensive by the glass. Overall, be grateful and enjoy."}
{"text":"It is so unfortunate that the only vegan restaurant in Calgary provides such a negative dining experience.  Right from the moment I called to reserve a table for our family, I should have known it was going to be a HUGE let down.  The owner was so rude on the phone.  I've read the other reviews and they all speak about poor service, I agree completely.  I have eaten at the Gratitude Cafe on several occasions, but only go back because I'm vegan and there are no other options in Calgary, except the Coup... which I LOVE.  The owner clearly doesn't like people, so don't go into the restaurant business! The only people out the the table of 8, that enjoyed their food were those who ordered the french toast.  It is delicious, but for $18, it better be.  And, do ask for maple syrup, they'll charge you extra.  Their prices are inflated as if it was a high class restaurant, but they treat their customers like an annoyance.  My niece did not like her lunch (it was awful) and so we told the owner who responded back with a sarcastic response and walked away.  When the owner came to take away the plates, most of the plates were full of food as no one enjoyed their meal, she berated us for wasting the food!! When it was time to pay the bill they refused to print off a receipt.  REALLY???  I've owned a restaurant in the past and you have to supply an itemized receipt if the customer wants one.  My mother wanted to take her left over french toast home with her and the waitress just tossed a tiny plastic at her (clearly too small to hold the amount of french toast we wanted to bring home) Gratitude Cafe ... I'm completely NOT grateful for my Mothers Day Brunch."}
{"text":"After reading all the negative posts we decided to go to see just how bad it could be! The young server who helped us greeted us warmly when we came in and was friendly throughout, the owner or cook did scold her publicly a couple of times , but also teased and chatted to her as well.  Food was excellent and we felt competitive to other eateries, overall a very pleasant experience!  Think it helped to be pre-framed for that type of personality though, had we gone in with a different mind set I think we would give a negative post as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to write about this place the first time and didn't get around to do doing it which is a good thing because the food was amazing but the service was so bad.  I couldn't believe with such outstanding food and drink that they had such a horribly bitter and very ungracious person to serve it.    But alas the gods have shined upon the small and quaint cafe with a stellar waitress who is both friendly and efficient she is also very attentive and entertaining.   I also gorge on the mushroom burger and the brioche .. I can't say enough great thngs about these two dishes. I also had a delicious blueberry iced tea and played a hand of solitaire whilst waiting for friends.  Good fresh food that literally bursts in your mouth, large portions and NOW great service .. So thankful and with tons of gratitude !!!  Please keep this bar up Gratitude!"}
{"text":"Very funky, unique atmosphere.  Fully vegetarian menu with some vegan, but I don't miss the meat.  Cute games on every table, and the staff are great - they even let me pull out Twister when I was there with some kids!  Comfortable place to sit, drink coffee and people watch on 10St."}
{"text":"Perhaps Gratitude Cafe has found and read their previous Yelp reviews? I stopped in here yesterday for a pot of tea and I must say, no complaints on service from me whatsoever. As a matter of fact, it's some of the best service I've ever gotten in a cafe.  We were greeted quite pleasantly by one of the staff who asked us to sit wherever we liked. When we said we were only here for a drink and not for lunch, she brought over the tea menus and waited for us to make our selections. Each of our teas came with its own pot and she came over about 3 different times while we were chatting to see if we needed any hot water refills.   It was a lovely afternoon! Maybe I caught them on a good day? I'm keen to go back now and see if they can repeat the experience (and try the food!)"}
{"text":"Even though I live and work in the same community as Gratitude... Even though I am a long time vegan.. Even though I dabble in raw food as well.. Even though there is only one other strictly vegetarian restaurant in this city that is not Chinese Food... I refuse to set foot in this restaurant. I tried to give it a chance, three times. I have walked in with an open mind, but each time have been let down. Never had I endured a meal at Gratitude without thinking about how I could be in the comfort of my home instead of under the wrath of hostile staff, making the food better myself. Rarely do I think this at restaurants.  Also, I have traveled to the original Gratitude a few times, as well as it's sister Gracias Madre in San Francisco. Most incredible food I have ever had in a restaurant. I can't believe that the owner of this establishment would even consider attempting this concept, with poorly executed, unwelcoming design, awful service, and the worst vegetarian food I Have ever paid for. I would personally be a little embarassed. Please save your money, go to Sunnyside Natural Market down the street and buy some actual organic produce, and cook yourself something lovely at home."}
{"text":"I have been back to Gratitude a few times now since my review and I have to say the attitude that past posts have spoken of and I have seen glimpses of myself, seem to be gone.  They have some new staff working and the owner seems less stressed.  Always amazing food - the Mushroom Pecan Burger on the Quinoa bun - YUM!! New favourite!  The bean burger is also excellent!  Wish I could afford this place every day!"}
{"text":"The food and drink choices are REALLY delicious and the concept of the place is brilliant. I prefer to support small businesses and I like the choices in Kensington. I love the writing on the walls in the bathrooms (expressions of gratitude) and the little games available at all the tables. A WOULD be great place for conversation....  Too bad the service there is reliably awful. I would also appreciate a simple \"no\" when I ask if there's free wireless, instead of a snotty \"Um. NO. You have to actually talk to people here. You know, face-to-face.\"  I have to agree with other reviewers who deem the staff hostile. I've been embarrassed to bring friends there twice now.   If they overhauled their staff, I would gladly go back. Until then, I won't be setting foot in there again to be patronized for trying to bring them business."}
{"text":"I've been here three times because it's close to my home and it's easy to go out with vegan friends. Each time food has been okay, price has been high and service has been poor. Today was the worst. As usual service was bad with scowls and a harsh mannerism but to top it off the main waitress, who I'm pretty sure is the owner, was having a big fight with the cook while we were waiting to pay. When I say fight I mean the waitress was yelling at the cook and not letting her get a word in, poor girl ended up walking out in tears. The waitress then had us use the debit machine alone as she stormed about. I don't care what work issues there may be. There is no excuse for abusing your employees in that way regardless of whether it is in front of customers or not. I would suggest that the owner take some cues from her menu names, \"I am grateful, I am patient, I am generous. \""}
{"text":"I was actually scared to go here last week. I had heard the service was weird and not so great. I am not sure why that is, our server was wonderful, nice and helpfully. I ordered the sandwich, and the toppings I was allow to choose from where amazing. I basically topped it with every thing. It is pricey but you know that going there. I will go there again. I almost walked back in to tell the server that I had a great lunch and she was really helpful. Hopefully they will read it on here."}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian, but always on the hunt for some good vegetarian food!  People recommended that I try out some restaurants in Kensington.    Gratitude Cafe has some nice, home cooked vegetarian meals.  Certainly not the best veggie food I've had, but still yummy.  I ordered a coconut curry with all sorts of veggies.  Filling and good, but lacking oomph.  Some of it was cooked, some of it wasn't, so it ended up being really hot patches of cooked food and some lukewarm pieces of (what was supposed to be) cold food.  The lemon ginger cheesecake is also good - not what you are expecting at first, but once you've had a few bites it definitely grows on you.    I can also see what people mean by hippie but clean and modern decor.  The clean and modern seems to come from the glass exterior and sterile looking tables, but the \"quirk\" comes from all the antique cabinets and games and toys.  Neat concept, with a great community feel (which is kind of nice when most Calgary streets seem to be empty!)  Our server was quite attentive, and I think had super hearing.  As soon as I remarked to our dining companions that I felt like something sweet (and she was where I thought she was out of earshot), she asked us if we wanted dessert.  If we were thirsty, she seemed to come just at the right time with water.    If I was a vegetarian and lived in Calgary, I would come here often."}
