{"text":"I bought some gluten free desserts at Whole Foods in Henderson from this company UR SWEET MADNESS and they were wonderful, so I just had to order some when I got back home as I was vacationing in Las Vegas at the time! I highly recommend these gluten free desserts! You can even order them online or pick them up locally in Las Vegas/Henderson! Yeah! :) We used our treats for a birthday party we had at a restaurant that had limited gluten free menu options! They were perfect in size after a large meal. If you need gluten free try their dessert! Thank you to the owner of this place for doing gluten free that tastes good!"}
