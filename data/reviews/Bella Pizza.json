{"text":"Les pizzas sont vraiment mauvaises, très grasses et sans gout."}
{"text":"Je suis un client régulier et a reçu aujourd'hui un mauvais service de l'opérateur téléphonique et le propriétaire. On m'a dit d'acheter à chez Mc Donalds."}
{"text":"Its a pretty decent place with a hidden weapon: the chicken BBQ pizza!  Its Not on the menu weirdly but Its so far their best pizza, Just ask for it!"}
{"text":"New to the OB, lots of pizza places around with mediocre pies but these guys are so far my favorite. Ordered a deep dish pepperoni and it was perfect. Ordered pick up and it was ready right on time. Cooked a little longer so the crust was nice and crispy. Store was clean. No complaints, will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I have lived in Old Brooklyn (burb of Cleveland, Ohio) 32 years of my life yet, never tried a Pizza from here and at one time..O.B. was the Pizza king of America...well, no more.. I read the reviews but never allow them to change my review... so, I was warned by neighbors that at best .Bella Pizza....mediocre ... well, my first call a very upset man answered, and kept saying, hello...hello...hello...click...not off to a great start...he was very rude, so..i became determined now and finally a lady answered and not much better...so, we ordered 2 Strombolies  with extra cheese... Quick delivery and the driver was very nice..so, looking good...well, till i bit into the Stromboli .... no extra cheese whatsoever... the Stromboli was lukewarm, the cheese tasted freezer burned, I must say...the Boxes were exceptional... tasted better than what we got..lol..:)..the side sauce was VERY COLD and tasteless ..then, the dreaded 2 dollar up charge...for what?lll Delivery, oh...it goes to the driver um...no...just pure profit and robbery. .... anyhow..sad, old food..."}
{"text":"My most recent pizza ! Used to come here as a kid! Im living closer again and decided to try it after years! It was just as i remember! So good! You can get both pizza and salad and both are tasty and at the right temperature! Salad is cold (not frozen wet) and fresh! Pizza is baked and not soggy or raw! This is a challenge for some places around here! I drive here and pickup because its worth it! Plain is still my fav here but they serve up a 7 item deluxe! YUM! I only wish they had ricotta and roasted red peppers! Their meatball sub is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrific. I asked at the counter if they still served veggi burgers. She told me they did,so I ordered a veggi burger. In English and French. So I said veggi burger twice in English and once in French.  It took forever to arrive and I was starving. There was a sauce that came with it so I asked if it was veggie. She went to check with the cook and she told me it wasn't so I didn't take it. I bit into the burger and it was unlike any veggie burger I'd had before. I was scared there may have been a mix up so I spit it out into a napkin. I asked the server if it was veggie and she assured me it was. I had brought my plate up to the counter. Then she came to my table twice to assure me it was veggie. I took two bites and swallowed. Then she came to tell me the veggie burger was made with falafel. This is when I really knew it was NOT veggie because it looked nothing like falafel. I went to the counter again and asked apologetically to look at the box the veggie burger came in. The cook came and brought the veggie burger patties and said he didn't have a box. I said they look nothing like the burger I had. At this point he owned up to his mistake and admitted that it was hamburger meat. I ran to the bathroom to throw up  there were no towels to dry my hands in there. The server came down to the washroom to see if I was throwing up!!? She brought me a towel. I told her she should really be more careful about what she served people. Then I went up and the chef saw me but said nothing so I said to him as well that he should really be more careful about what he served people. The server blamed the cook and the cook blamed the server. I asked for my $ back and she brought it to me. I said how would you like it if I served you maggots or something that would be equally gross for you. You wouldn't like it! Then he offered to make me something else but I was totally grossed out at this point and there was no way I could trust them to make me food.  It shows how little care they put into making and caring for their customers."}
{"text":"So we just had them deliver again, third time in the last two months.  The last time they gave us a menu, so tonight we ordered off of it.  They must have raised their prices 30% because everyone was running for more money when we were told a different price.  Okay, that happens not that much of a problem.  Open the pizza, its not that large for a $19 pizza.  Then the pieces only have one little piece of meat per slice of pizza.  Its highly doubtful we will order here again.  The sauce and pizza is good, but not for that price and barely any toppings on it."}
{"text":"Pathetic excuse for pizza. It ended up in my tree. I am serious."}
{"text":"Generous slice of pizza (Jumbo pizza cut in 6 slices instead of 8) Full of flavors. Nice and calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bella for years and I have yet to find better pizza anywhere in Cleveland including in the burbs. Their pie reminds me of an old mom & pop pizza joint from the 70s. The crust they make you will not find at the chain places. The toppings are always great especially the Italian sausage which is the best. The calzones and sandwiches are really good  although the sandwiches are a little small for the price I think.  Their menu is quite large for carry out but still very basic. The pizza prices may seem a little high until you dig in and compare how the pizza is made. They do not cut corners on toppings. Their sauce is not overly sweet which is also important to me in a pizza joint. GIVE IT A TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Look, the pizza hits the spot. I would definitely recommend it as a hangover cure because wowwwwwww that is some cheesy pizza.  The service was fine, the atmosphere as well.  I think the thing that most impressed me was that, for a hole-in-the-wall greasy pizza place, the salad we split was huge and also absolutely chock full of fresh greens and veggies, which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"In our seemingly neverending quest to try all of the local pizzas in Cleveland we decided to give Bella Pizza a shot. Why Bella? Well, for one thing, they're right around the corner and I drive by their shop nearly every day.   Bella is your typical, Cleveland neighborhood pizza and wings joint. They're located in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood in a corner shop across from a gas station. No frills, no pretense, no website. Yeah, I had to actually Google this place and then go to AllMenus.com to find something. Not a huge deal, but it is 2014. Moving on.  We ordered delivery from them on a Friday around 5:30pm. The guy on the phone said it would be 30-45 minutes. Typical. We selected a large, pepperoni, mushroom and banana peppers with a side of cheesy bread - $18.85 without tip.  The Delivery: We live a stone's throw from Bella so I wouldn't expect that a drive over to our place would take all that long. From phone call to knock on the door it was about 30 minutes. Nice.  The Crust: Nice and chewy with a crispy outside. It also had a nice thickness to it somewhere between New York style and deep dish. Not much in the flavor department but a nice vehicle nonetheless.  The Sauce: Your typical tomato sauce. I'm used to everyone loading their pizza sauce with sugar. Not the case here. A good flavor, loaded on in the proper amount but lacking a bit of salt.  The Toppings: Canned toppings. No surprises here. The mushrooms were OK and the pepperoni and banana pepper rings added the salt that the sauce was missing, so that helped.  The Sides: Who doesn't love pizza dough covered in garlic butter and cheese and baked golden brown? I'm a sucker for this carb madness and this stuff was delicious. Came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.  Like I said, Bella Pizza is solid. I'd actually give them 3.5 stars but you know how Yelp is. I haven't had any of their other menu items (wings, pizza rolls, salads, sandwiches, etc.) but I'd imagine they're on par with other venues of this ilk."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Their pasta dishes are good. Don't order the wings. They are pre fried then frozen. All they do is put them on their rotating oven and they don't get crispy. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"There is no trace of this place.  I found this restaurant last night thru Yelp, ordered online to pick up, paid, drove, no Bella...instead a different restaurant is there. Nearby businesses said they pulled stakes.   What a waste of time and effort!"}
{"text":"My friend Brian Dolan swears by their pizza so I gave it a shot! Greasy but very tasty (pepp,sausage sheet pizza)...I have been a fan since 2009..."}
{"text":"We love Bella pizza! Have been coming here for years. I prefer Bella's pizza over the overly sweet sauce of Angelo's. And their prices are a lot easier to swallow too!"}
{"text":"Wow, just ordered a pizza from Bella Pizza and the girl who answered the phone made me feel like I was interrupting her evening.  I have ordered several pizzas from here and they are good but I guess they don't realize that the person who answers the phone is the voice of the company."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since maybe 2000 great pizza light dense crust not too thick. The waiting area is not big at all theres no dine inn but this is an institution of pizza for the West Park neighborhood so if your in the area its right off Puritas check em out you wont be dissapointed. There sauce is great tasting and the crust are my favorites of their ingredients."}
{"text":"Excellent service, new business and the food is great.  Excellent choices for pizza, calzones, pasta dishes and sandwiches.  They are next to Starbucks, facing south towards the theater. Would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"This is not the best pizza you will have nut it sure hits the sweet spot. If you want something fast, cheap that will dothe job dont even think twice. Nice atmosphere, cool staff and well what wlse do you need?"}
{"text":"It's very good delivery pizza in the area. Probably the best delivery in the Cams Corner area. The sausage pizza is possibly the best in Cleveland, and the dough has a very nice texture. I used to get their pizza when they had a shop on Fulton and was disappointed when that one closed, but I am happy to find that the pizza at this location is just as good."}
{"text":"J'ai toujours aimé leur pizza , grosse, bourrative un peu salé mais ca fait la job, bcp de tables , rapide , seems clean, water fountain, journal de Mtl pour potiner.."}
{"text":"Really awesome Bbq chicken pizza it's a million times better than angelos love it !!! What a hidden gem and the lady was very nice taking the order will keep coming back for sure !!"}
