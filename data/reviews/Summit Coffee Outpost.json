{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and welcoming. They had a nice hipster setup and the customer service is very good. The only problem was when I ordered iced coffee the sugar was not dissolved and just sunk to the bottom. Overall, I would recommend this place and would definitely get their pizzas again."}
{"text":"Great coffee for a college campus hangout and study spot. Good space for gathering, with seating for laptops inside and at picnic tables outside. One entire wall is windows, and I love the light fixtures. 

They don't have soy milk for their dairy free options--but they do have almond milk and oat milk. 

Menu is lattes, drip, tea, and beer. (Maybe more, I was wrangling a kid). My iced latte was good. 

We went to a celebration hosted there, and I was awed by their hospitality in the space. My kid and a couple others were drawing where they were about to put out food and instead of telling me my kids were in the way, they said: \"are these your kids? We are about to put food out here, there are some open seats there, can y'all move?\" It was done with graciousness. That's means a lot to me. Especially in a place that doesn't see a lot of kids. (I presume, being on a residential college campus). I'll go next time I'm on campus."}
{"text":"Very cute interior and trivia night is fun, but besides that summit is not that good. If you buy anything besides standard coffee or tea you are overpaying. You either wait forever to get some okay food, or they just don't have ingredients. This has happened to me the past 5 times I have come to summit over a 2 year period. If you know avocados are a big seller, buy some more. Summit is too stingy with their money and this has compromised the establishment. Also cmon, toast! I have to wait 20 minutes for freaking toast. Waitstaff is really fun and friendly but they don't have their head screwed on in the kitchen. In summary tea and coffee good, food slow and bad."}
{"text":"This is my not so secret spot tucked away on Davidson's campus. When school is in session it's often crowded, and sometimes on the noisy side but don't let that deter you -- There's no better pancake or pour over in town.  

Friendly staff, great coffee, and delicious brunch make this one of my favorite spots. Check their website for hours though - it often follows Davidson's schedule closing for holiday breaks and such. They're also open limited days/hours during the summer months."}
{"text":"We come here on the weekends frequently when we need to visit the college campus for a tutor- the coffee is fresh roasted and delicious. Although not my favorite beans in the world still quite good. They have fresh baked pastries here as well as some breakfast foods. Not organic or non-GMO necessarily but still fresh and very very yummy. I only wish they carried at least one milk with no added sugar's. Is a cozy comfortable spot, unpretentious with a lovely outdoor space as well."}
{"text":"Summit outpost is a staple on campus. They've got some great drink deals and great dairy alternatives for their coffees. Great place to do work and hang out with friends. My biggest complaint is the removal of the food menu this past semester."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place doesn't have any reviews, but I'm certainly happy to be the first to do so. I love this spot. They're everything a hip little coffee shop should be, and more. They have all sorts of events (like open mic), great coffee, pretty good beer wine selection, and awesomeness behind the counter! I'm only in town for the summer but I'll definitely miss this place when I leave."}
