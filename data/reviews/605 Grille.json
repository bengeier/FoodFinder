{"text":"Stopped in here after the pizza place down the street was to busy to serve us outside. Food was good, service was awesome and the wine selection was nice. I'd certainly come back here."}
{"text":"Mushroom soup is to die for.  Service will make you want to die. Not exactly that bad.  The waitress never once asked if we wanted anything else, glasses empty. Talked my spouse out of ordering what he originally requested.  Salads are not as big as they said.  Never talk a 6' 200 man to order a cup of soup and a salad. My man loves fine dining but after this me he headed straight to DQ.  Cute little restaurant.  I ordered the Black Bean Burger and it was very tasty with a huge order of homemade and I believe organic bread with a side of fresh cut french fries, much more than I would be able to eat. After bad service and talking my husband out of what he requested the first time not enough fresh cut french fries in the world would make him happy. He's happy now, he had a strawberry   sundae and it's just a bad memory,  last but not least they are very stingy on their wine pour.  Pretty tasty overall"}
{"text":"the mushroom Swiss burger was good but not great. it needed more melty goodness. the seasoned fries were really good. my wife's quiche was amazing. her brie salad was even better. the service was great and the atmosphere was even better. i will definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the specials, the curry soup was great"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Madison.  The food is always flavorful.  Attention is paid to fresh local ingedients.  Good craft beer and wine selection.  Exceedingly clean."}
{"text":"This business had closed as of 4/25/15.  From their FB page:  Dear 605ers,   With much thought and consideration, the 605 family has decided that it's the end of the road for us and the restaurant. This Saturday will be our last night of service. Thank you, thank you, thank you for 7 great years of business!"}
{"text":"605 Grille was one of the locations I've been meaning to visit in Madison since we moved to Madison. While I was extremely disappointed in their beer selection--two IPAs and a Wheat on tap--their beer cheese dip and 605 burger were outstanding. The bun for the burger was like a yeast roll, buttery and delicious. Their fries were perfect crunchy, real fresh morsels of delight. Overall, awesome food, though not an extensive menu. Beer selection could improve with the addition of a bottle list to meet the needs of people who aren't into what's on their short draft list at the time. Otherwise, very nice waitress and good food with good friends. Only 4 stars because of the beer issue."}
{"text":"I was near the area for work and wanted to meet up with a friend for dinner. He said it would be worth the 30+ minute drive to check out the 605 Grille so I took his word for it and I'm glad we did.   From the appetizer to our entrees to the beer menu I was not let down. Our waitress was polite and great with everything. The food was well done and filling. My only problem was how with how quiet the place was... there wasn't even your typical Pandora station playing in the background or a TV on.   Maybe this is because, Madison is more of a tourist area as the oldest bar in Indiana is located just a few blocks down and it was originally the largest town in Indiana. This is also given away when you see the other buildings that align the street. Nonetheless, we arrived at 8 pm on a Thursday and there was only one other couple in the place. If felt as though everyone could listen to our conversation because there appeared to be an echo."}
{"text":"Great little spot on Madison. Locally sourced products. Good beer selection. Tonight I had the ribeye. Was well prepared and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Considering how small Madison is, I didn't have super high expectations for any restaurant here, but 605 Grille was a fairly tasty meal overall. The dining area is open, inviting, and earthy, with a mix of casual (paper topping the tables) and classy (cloth napkins). I was happy about the menu and the several vegetarian options that were hard to choose from. I ended up going with the chickpea burger, which was good but not mind-blowing - it was an interesting curry-style take on a bean burger with a tasty yogurt sauce and a homemade bun. I was pretty disappointed with my french fries, though - I was surprised they would serve them so overcooked to the point of being almost burnt. So much potential. The caramel apple bread pudding was another dish with a lot of potential that was good, but not great. The service was slow, as well (for the US - I have gotten used to European service and wasn't in a hurry so I didn't mind that too much).  605 Grille, keep on trying. I think with some better cooks and servers and some recipe tinkering, you could be really amazing."}
