{"text":"I was actually a bit disappointed by my latest experience at C's. I've had better. Typically I would give it a 3-star but some of the service wasn't the greatest and my food was cold...  C's is the kind of family-friendly experience that makes it a 3 to 4 star restaurant on a good day, but on this particular day, our primary server was impatient and lacked a customer-first attitude and the quality of food was lacking. However, the service for a never less then half empty coffee mug, was superb.   I do love the bakery items so couldn't resist the pecan roll, but my egg sandwich with hash browns could have been better. The hash browns were cold and the croissant was dry. The bacon however, crispy, just like I requested.  But, I was with my family, we were tucked in a cozy corner booth, had great conversation and due to the history of this restaurant and the many times I've been there before, it would be a place I would recommend. I guess the day I was there was just an \"off day\". That happens."}
{"text":"I first heard of C's from a review in 77 Square or some such thing and thought I'd try it.  I've NEVER had a bad dish there.  The bread for french toast is made in the restaurant - not pre-made and heated up, not store made bread, but real home made stuff.  The belguim waffles are fresh - not the frozen-then-heated-up kind.  Egg dishes are wonderful - lots of everything in the omelets, etc.  The staff is really friendly and service, yes, can be a bit slow, but they are ALWAYS hopping!  I give them a break because of that...  I took the bf there for the first time on a Badger football Saturday and now I can't go anywhere else!! : )  Portions are huge (often have a box to go) and as others have mentioned, the bakery is amazing : )    Ya Gotta Try It!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for food and service. The atmosphere and decor could use some help -- the interior is clean and neat, but dated. The outside/exterior can't be helping business -- if you can get past the stark white exterior walls, the green roof line, and the nondescript sign, you'll be treated to a good, \"from scratch\" meal that tastes homemade, with excellent/friendly service. This is a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you're ever looking for a delicious breakfast on the west side of Madison, this is the place to go.   My husband and I were saying on the west side, but didn't want to pay the $20 surcharge at our hotel for meh hotel breakfast. Instead, we looked around at our options, and found that C's was highly rated for breakfast, and not too far away. (Best of all, it was about 5 minutes away from our morning destination, I'm Board!)   The first day we came here, we sat outside. (The gramma/farm decor kind of threw me off.) I had the blueberry pancakes with a side of hashbrowns and coffee, and my husband had an omlette with ham, onions, and cheddar & toast. Delicious - I don't know the last time I had such wonderful food when eating out. Even the coffee (and his pepsi!) were great. They hit it out of the park so hard that we decided to come back on Sunday rather than heading downtown to another place for brunch that we found.  Sunday's breakfast, my husband had a repeat of Saturday's, and I had one of their specials - a chocolate/banana muffin, eggs, hashbrowns, and bacon. It was also tasty.  If I had to complain about anything, it'd be that C's is too far away for me to enjoy regularly  :)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast place in the Madison/Middleton area.  Great food and outstanding service.  Definitely has grandma's kitchen feel to it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place sooo much and my husband and I miss our once a month trips there.  Came to review them to make sure they're still around; relieved they are.  This place is cozy, the food is good, the family that owns it are great and recognized us when we were there in the past.  I hope to go there next month when I'm back home."}
{"text":"Friendly and welcoming staff, nice clientele. Unfortunately, the food isn't very good. Coffee was not drinkable. Pancakes were flat and chewy. Scrambled eggs were very simple, but just not tasty. Pastries looked average. Dishes are all priced under $10 for the most part, that is a plus."}
{"text":"C's is a FANTASTIC place for breakfast. Family owned, this restaurant makes all the breads, buns, pies, and bakery in house. I had the eggs benedict and was pleased to be given a choice of ham or turkey, but of course I had to try the more traditional ham. I also made my hashbrowns \"C's hashbrowns\" by adding cheddar cheese and onions. The eggs benedict was delicious, the hollandaise sauce was also homemade and was the best I have ever had and the freshly thick shredded hashbrowns were very tasty and not greasy! C's was busy on this Sunday morning, but the service was quick, friendly, and delightful. C's has quickly become a favorite for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Deliciously Amazing! I had the banana bread French toast and the biscuits and gravy with and over easy egg on top! Sooooo good! My husband had the eggs Benedict, also delicious! Service was very fast and really friendly!  Eventually although the biscuits were gone I had to ask the waitress to remove the gravy from my table, otherwise I may have licked the plate clean  which although it would have been totally worth it my husband would have been severely embarassed"}
{"text":"I love this place. My office is a couple blocks away, so I have breakfast or lunch here a few times a month. The coffee is fantastic--not too strong like most of the other places around--and the hashbrowns are worth noting as well: fresh and crispy. I like my eggs \"over medium\" and they somehow always get them perfect. Many of the waitresses know me by name--the \"C\" could definitely stand for \"Cheers\" (like the TV show) since I'm always welcomed by name and pleasant conversation. I read some of the other reviews and was shocked at comparisons to Denny's & Perkins--this place serves FRESH FOOD with UNCOMMONLY FRIENDLY SERVICE. And the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So there I was, with a soaking wet tent and on my way to the National Mustard Museum. But hey, hard-core mustard fan as I am, I know better  than to start the day with all-you-can-sample-mustard, right?  So the BF and I surfed Yelp to find a decent breakfast stop and Lo, right down the street from our campground was C's, so we figured we'd stop in.  Now, it was Father's Day, which we realized when we walked in, cause the place was packed.   It's pretty much your standard breakfast food, with some specialty bakery fare. Clean, tasty and fairly reasonably priced. It is not a huge place either, but there was PLENTY of waitstaff to keep things moving.   I had the skillet breakfast, which I was very pleased to find had the option of turkey. (This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .  (BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)  Waitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us.   I noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce.   It being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too. Dads got a HUGE complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry, which I thought was nice.     Oh yeah, the eggs with Hollendaise sauce looked and smelled really good..."}
{"text":"I have breakfast at C's Bakery often because I live within walking distance.  I sometimes get the pecan waffle but most often get Biscuits & Gravy or the Eggs Benedict.  I was in there last week and had Eggs Benedict and an order of Holly Browns, which are hash browns with cheese, onions and topped with hollandaise sauce. That was a really good combination for a frigid February morning.   Service is always polite and attentive and prompt, even when they're busy."}
{"text":"The breakfast food here is amazing! The staff and service are great! They always have fresh products. Love it!"}
{"text":"If you remember the old country kitchen restaurant chain the inside to core will remind you a lot of this restaurant. Must try a cinnamon roll and must try the homemade hashbrowns there today for. Lots of food for a good price the eggs were super fresh.  This is the place to get a good old fashion breakfast though I eat light and healthy I was with friends who wanted to try this place.  One of the best things about this restaurant is Gina she is fantastic and I hope if you get a chance to eat at this restaurant she will be the one to take care of you.  This was the first time I ever met her and I instantly loved her gave her a hug on the way out she was so sweet. She makes this place 100 times better!!  Gave four stars instead of five only because the food is heavier than what I preferred to eat."}
{"text":"Fresh hash browns. It has been so, so long since I have had fresh hash browns cooked to perfection. And C's does them right! They are so good. If they don't come with your meal, you must get them as a side.  Besides the hash browns, this is your normal breakfast joint. My boyfriend and I meandered into C's after stopping at the Original Pancake House and finding out about the 45 minute wait. I was way too hungry so that wasn't going to work. So we made our way here and were pleasantly surprised! The menu offers many different options, including a cinnamon swirl pancake that I can't wait to try the next time we're in.  I had the Eggs Benedict, and although the sauce was a little broken, it was tasty. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the English muffin was toasty and yummy. My boyfriend had a smoked sausage skillet, which he subbed in bacon for. He also said his meal was delicious, and finished the entire thing. Like others have said, the bread is amazing!  Don't expect the ambiance to knock your socks off, but the stellar service makes up for it. I cannot wait to be back. We've already decided to stop here the next few Sundays to try other things off of their menu!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 2 times so far and both times enjoyed the home cooked breakfast and the positive, quick service. However the space is small (former KFC) and the space is too tight during the wait for brunch on the weekend. I will try again during the week when it is less busy."}
{"text":"C's is great.  Very laid back, friendly servers and good food.  Love that they have outdoor seating.  The sourdough bread is the best!  All of their bread is homemade.  Yum."}
{"text":"I don't get the love for this place? Maple flavored corn syrup for your pancakes,  house recipe jelly AKA sysco. Bitter non-arabic coffee. Just another sysco distributer. I won't be back.  No home made jam, nor fresh biscuits or rolls, or daily made bread. Nothing..... Just warm and serve Sysco food (ick). The bright spot is the service was spot on. Sadly the food wasn't. My meal was $10.94."}
{"text":"Hmmm . . . Did someone over rate this place?  The description of this family restaurant made it sound like a diamond in the rough with its fresh baked good and down home cooking.  Well they missed the boat.  The place is small and bit crowded, but it's charm is there.  They take the time to put out seasonal decorations and welcome everyone with a smile.  Our waitress was as sweet as could be.  I ordered a Vegetarian omelette made with egg whites.  My son ordered the Veggie Eggs Benefits.  He thought his was great and it came with a mound of hash browns that could feed a family.  My omelette was weak at best, and I mean weak.  It as over cooked and anything but an omelette.  The eggs were like scrambled eggs but pressed into an omelette like formation.   The veggies were sparse.  As a side I got Cranberry toast which I so looked forward to, but when I got it the slices were saturated in butter.  Not just a lot, but dripping and soggy.  I appreciate a good greasy spoon as much as the next person.  There is a time and place for them, and when you eat at one the flavors are something that knock you back with goodness, even though you know you'll need to run an extra 5 miles the next day.  C's is just a greasy spoon.  IHOP and Denny's are far better choices."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sunday breakfast/brunch spot on Madison's westside or in Middleton.    C's is not only a restaurant, but also a bakery.  The chocolate custard Bismarck is so rich!  They make their own custard filling, doesn't come out of a can-delicious! It's so large I bring leftovers home to savor during week.  The hash browns are made there.  Potatoes are parboiled, shredded, then fried.  They will add onion and cheese making these hash browns extra yummy. The extra crispy hash browns are truly extra CRISPY!   I had a the breakfast melt with sausage.  Large sausage patty with scrambled egg, cheddar cheese on their homemade sourdough bread-then grilled.  My favorite!  My husband loves their eggs Benedict!  Very large serving...with hash browns!  His go to dish every Sunday!  The outdoor patio is a beautiful spot-shady and clean!  They have a lot of regular customers.  Waitstaff very friendly with efficient service!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I are were craving some breakfast and we didn't want Denny's this time. So I told her about this place my co-worker had always raved about. She looked online at the site and she instantly said \"Yes!\" We arrived about 945 on a Saturday morning and this place was a buzzing!   We were seated at a booth/table. We were given menu's and waters right away. I ordered the C's Breakfast Special - Two eggs, hashbrowns, with a choice of ham, bacon, sausage links or patties and toast. I ordered the bacon which seemed a little over done in my opinion.   My fiancee had the C's Sporty - Hashbrowns topped with ham, grilled onions, cheddar cheese and two eggs with toast. She liked it, she said it was filling though.   The best part of this breakfast was the fresh Rhubarb Jam for our toast. Wow, I wanted to take some home it was so good. The prices are kinda more expensive then most mom and pop breakfast places in my opinion. They must be doing something right as I've noticed they're consistently busy.   I'd go back, service was a little slow though."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4.5, it is very friendly and inviting. They serve fresh baked toasted bread with the breakfast items, try the sourdough or rye. They give you a nice sized portion and they quick, not rushed.  The place is always busy which is a good sign in my opinion. Ihave never had to wait more then a couple of minutes for a table and if push comes to shove there is a small counter.  There is seating outdoors for the nicer days and they are constently changing the decorations to the season or athletic event. I keep coming back and have yet to be disappointed.  If you like tabasco withyour meal you might want to bring your own as they will bring out a botle but it is the habanero type. It may be to hot for some palettes."}
{"text":"This place is the diner you've been looking for.  Be sure to time it right because they have unique hours, but enjoy the wonderfully attentive service and the simple yet savory dishes.  The breakfast and bakery seems to be the draw, and I can personally attest to the wonderfulness of the veggie-laden, down-home hash browns.  Good value for the price, too.  I look forward to re-visiting!"}
{"text":"We tried C's for the first time this past weekend and I was pleasantly surprised!  I thought it was going to be Perkins-esque with not a lot of character and a hum-drum menu.  Not the case.  Decor was cute, seasonal, and lively.  The homemade baked goods were delicious.....I should have worn sweatpants!  Very solid breakfast choices and an extremely pleasant and attentive wait staff made our experience with 2 young children very enjoyable.  We have pegged this our new breakfast spot- so glad we stopped in!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Awesome spot for breakfast. Great food and super friendly staff. Gina was our waitress and she was witty and so much fun.  Get the cinnamon roll pancakes! They are to die for!!!!!  This will be out \"go to\" for breakfast when in Madison!!"}
{"text":"We tried C's for breakfast over the 4th of July weekend. Upon entering, it is obvious that this is a no-frills family-style restaurant. Pretty much gives that \"small town\" feel, which isn't bad by any means.  Our dishes were standard. Not bad, but nothing great. Service was lackluster, even if it was pretty busy...  This place does look to have an AMAZING baked goods section. Tons of pastries, cookies, and muffins. Plus, all of the breads are made in-house(my darling dear said his toast was top notch).  Next time we stop in, I'll be skipping the menu, and snatching something out of the bakery case."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Clean, friendly staff, fast food, too and it closes so early! Lunch there is also SO good!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Madison, without question. Small town diner fare, but they bake their own bread and pastries. Great service and very affordable. I come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"The seating is extremely cramped and crowded. The atmosphere is nice and I would describe it as a Wisconsin style country Cafe. Great breakfast food. But I think it's overpriced and I've found the staff to be really snobby. Once in awhile I get somebody that's briefly friendly but usually they are busy and have crabby looks on their faces as they rush around and you feel like you're in the way. And since it's so crowded and squished in that place you ARE in the way and you know it. I don't like to go there anymore. I miss the food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I checked out this place on Labor Day right after the Mustard Museum.  It was closing at noon and the nice waitress let us eat quickly.  I had the steak and eggs with toast.  My girlfriend had the peach n' French toast plus the eggs benedict vegetarian style.  Well, we took home the French toast after eating half of it.  However, everything else was heavenly and the bread was amazing in my mind.  We were the last to leave but glad to have stopped here instead of McDonalds or another chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Hash browns are delicious. The egg dishes are filling. Coffee is actually not half bad! This is truly great diner food-- the spot is busy, the food is inexpensive, and service was quick and friendly. We were very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Solid spot for diner breakfast fare in Middleton-- popular with the grandma and grandpa set.  Like all good diners, service is friendly, they keep the coffee cup full, and know how to crank through tables.  They've always been busy when we've been there (weekend mornings) but even when the wait looks long it's less than 10 minutes-- and once you're seated, service is quick.  Breakfasts are definitely of the \"this is not healthy for you\" variety, but it's good for a treat (I don't know how my kid made it through his cinnamon-swirl pancakes which were topped with the kind of glaze you put on cinnamon rolls, especially after he added syrup to it...)"}
{"text":"This is truly home cooking at its best. The staff is abundant and friendly. My breakfast today consisted of the Blueberry French Toast. The blueberries are actually in the bread dough!  Served with warm syrup. Definitely worth getting up early and running those two miles. Open only until 1:00 pm so make your plans to get there!!"}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff. Quick. Clean. And the best hash browns I've ever eaten! Always a crowd here but they take care in being speedy too."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Warm friendly atmosphere where the wait staff knows your name after a couple of visits. The coffee is smooth and mello. Never bitter or burnt tasting. \"Where Middleton goes for breakfast.\""}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with a fun local feel. Inside seating is cozy and nice alternative to a chain like Perkins. Affordable prices, but food is just average."}
{"text":"If asked a few months ago, I would have given them 4 stars. Their breakfasts are awesome and homemade which is great, but they have a no substitution policy that knocks them down a notch. My husband doesn't eat eggs, and they refuse to give him extra hash browns, or at least take off the price of eggs. But it does have a great environment and they're otherwise friendly."}
{"text":"I come here almost every other weekend. The food is so good. Everything is homemade and you can taste the difference. Their hashbrowns are to die for."}
{"text":"Cs is my home away from home. I have been here more than likely 15 or more times. I have come with one person or five, there is always room for my group.  Non-stop service, refills often. Delicious, consistent food. I would gladly drive 45 minutes just for an omelette. Food has never taken more than 10 minutes to be served after order time.   After so many visits, the staff has recognized me and has made me feel at home. With a very strong emphasis on home decor, I could not be happier. I recommend this restraunt to everyone who even mentions the city of Middleton. The owners are fantastic.  If your looking for a fantastic breakfast or lunch spot, Cs is the place to be. Be ready to wait 2-5 minutes for a table on Sunday!   I would give this restraunt a 10 star if I could, so fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! And great service, I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Whenever I am in  Middleton, I eat breakfast or lunch here. Home cooking!! Friendly staff! Fresh baked goods."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast. It is nothing fancy, but always a solid breakfast and friendly service. They have a large menu and the food is always hot. It is a fun place to start the day. On Badger Saturdays you need to get there early as there is always a crowd. If you have not tried them, you need to!"}
