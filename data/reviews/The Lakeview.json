{"text":"- If you haven't eaten at The Lakeview, I'd suggest you do.It's quickly become one of my favorite places to go when I'm craving diner food, but want to stay away from the typical greasy spoon diner type-of-place. The Lakeview is open 24 hours-a-day, and that definitely contributes to one of the cool aspects of this place: it isn't that you can eat imaginative diner-esque food at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday, but also thatyou can eat it at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on aSunday and the experience is entirely different. That's because it's inconsistent, but not in a bad way. It's inconsistent because of the diverse group of peeps you can expect to see there when you go: Sunday afternoon is the brunch crowd, Saturday evening is the daters, Friday late-night is the Ossignton bar crowd. Whenever you go, it's a different sorta experience. It's not just diversity that makes this a kick-ass experience, the food is also spectacular and truly imaginative. The style of upscale-diner definitely comes through on their menu withitems like theCorriander Walnut Pesto Omelette, a Peameal Brie and Havarti Cristo-style sandwich, and the Lakeface Albacore Tuna Melt. It's a genuinely nice blend of the expected and the unexpected. As a side note, I need to mention the impressive veggie burger they've got that's made from black beans and served with a wild mushroom saute and caramelized onions. Spectacular. Whether it's their 24-hour menu or their brunch menu, vegetarian or carnivore items, this place cranks out some delicious food. I'd definitely recommend you check out The Lakeview. They're doing diner food right, 24 hours-a-day."}
{"text":"After reading some great things about this place, myself and my boyfriend decided to check it out one Sunday afternoon. I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research.   Because of the beautiful weather, we decided to sit outside on the patio. It was about 1 in the afternoon but we were seated right away. I found the menu to be a bit too busy, whereas my boyfriend liked the layout of it. We were served water right away, which was presented nicely in a tall, thin jug. Even though it was our waiters fourth week on the job (he informed us later), he was friendly and efficient.   I did quickly take a look at the interior. I really liked the unique layout of the bar area, a real eye-catcher once you enter. However, the rest of the restaurant had more of a diner feel to it accomplished by booth seating, which wasn't anything special.    We ordered coffee ($2), which my boyfriend thought was a bit watery, fresh large orange juice to share ($4.25) and I had The Standard breakfast ($9.25) with poached eggs and bacon. Our orders came out about 10 minutes after ordering. The poached eggs were in their own little container, which I liked; less mess! Although they were a bit too runny. The bacon was not as crispy as I would like it, but very tender. The rye bread was pre-buttered (always a favorite), and the fried sliced potatoes had a hint of paprika on it which was lovely. I wasn't a huge fan of the green salad as it had no flavor to it; a bit of dressing would have made a difference. Although the addition of blueberries was nice visually and to the taste. I also liked the addition of a slice of melon; I have found it's always good to pair off greasy food with a bit of fruit as it seems to take away from the greasiness.  The total bill was $34, a bit pricey, but for the nice seats, beautiful weather and great portion sizes, it was worth it. Definitely a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it was one of the only things open at 3am and I had been there several times before during its previous incarnation.  + milkshakes + interesting menu ideas   - food on the bland side - very poor service ---------------------------------- Pretty good at 3am, but not at any other time of day."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I had high hopes and lots of people told me it's great, but to make a long story short; they served my husband an entirely uncooked fish sandwich. My sandwich was tiny and unimpressive. About 12 fries. That cost $15 and they still charged me for my meal. Dirty bathrooms with no hot water. And you are on hipster time, so our uncooked lunch fiasco took 45 min and my husband left starving.  There also seems to be no heat in here."}
{"text":"Can I say milkshakes to die for!!!  SOOO many choices and an awesome vibe!! We both were happy with our meals, offbeat takes on classic diner foods."}
{"text":"Amazing place for brunch on the weekends!  Extensive menu, big portions and cool vibe that brings you back to the 50's.  Prices are great too."}
{"text":"The Ossington Massive .. That's all I can say!! It delicious with everything you could possible crave for breakfast at 2 am or anytime for that matter!! 24 hr place in a decent area in Toronto with good service at night time, maybe not so much in the weekends! Especially Sunday for brunch! I wouldn't go.. But all the other times it's really good.. And the servers are funny and friendly, even share a few stories with you! But all in all the food is great, for dinner food at anytime, don't think you can get better than this! I also recommend the poutine and the pancakes with strawberries, as well as the milkshakes. Totally delicious, like chocolate with Oreo and Irish cream!! The bomb!!   Thanks Lakeview,"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here.  Wide range of menu items with something for everyone (lots of vegetarian options too) and everything I've had has been very good. Perfect  for larger groups and for children.  Great drink specials!   Sometimes it can be a little slow when busy."}
{"text":"I like this place.  One of the main reasons is its location, I live about 5 minutes away.  I have only ever been for lunch, once having a tastey grilled cheese and the next time having a delicious grilled vegetable sandwich.  Both times I had salad as my side.  The prices are reasonable, about $9 and I thought the portions were good, I wasn't stuffed when I left but totally satisfied."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here last night at 3am.  Our cumulative order was: coffee, 2 milkshakes (chocolate mint + vanilla peanut butter), 2 club sandwiches (one with sweet potato fries) and poutine.  The food was excellent and for that reason alone I will return here at some point.   However the conversation at our table centered around a debate that my friends and I had over the service. My contention was that it wasn't good because our server was tired and inattentive, my friend felt that he was just being a dick.  What we weren't debating however was that our service sucked.   Examples:  1.) I ordered coffee that didn't arrive until our food came and we noticed there was no coffee. When I did get it, it was the least hot cup of coffee I've ever had.   2.) actual conversation:  my friend - 'I gotta say man, I don't know what milkshake to get. What should I get?' server - \"Whatever you want.' At which point he starting naming off ALL the different kinds. My friends was looking for any kind of recommendation and instead had the menu read back to him.  3.) We had to ask multiple times for our bill and for refills of water.  I don't know how much of this is anecdotal or how much of this is par for the course."}
{"text":"A delicious, generous brunch with excellent service.  We were in the early side, so weren't able to take advantage of the affordable mimosas, but that is definitely next on the list.  I particularly enjoyed the pancake medallions.  Just big enough to get the taste, but small enough to leave room for the rest of your breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place for late night eats or early morning dining! Cheap, fast and delicious. Love the $5 Caesar's. Disco poutine was just OK... I'd rather have their sandwiches and hot plates really. Cornflake chicken was good! Milkshakes were sinfully yum."}
{"text":"What a great time !  My friend & I went  to The Lakeview midday and sat in a booth for 2 in the \"big window\" section [the east half of the restaurant].  As is their custom, we were given a large bottle of water and two glasses and were asked if we wanted any other beverages [\"regular\" organic fair trade coffee for my friend, decaf for me - would I mind waiting while they brewed a fresh pot ?]. We took our time perusing the extensive menu. I appreciated the number of vegetarian choices, and our server - who was above and beyond! - told us the menu was being revamped and would include even more vegetarian choices.  Count me in!  Today I tried one of their specials, the Tostada Ensalada with mixed lettuces, onions [lots of onions, oh my], tomatoes, one or two types of cheese, avocado and corn tortilla strips [$5/$8].  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich [$11] with melted Havarti and caramelized onions on a soft kaiser, plus side salad & fries. The huge sandwich, which she cut in half - who could pick it up? - was a hit. The service was attentive but not rushed. We had many refills of coffee [$2.50 for a bottomless cup] and a new bottle of water while we made our way through our meal and surprisingly, decided to share a piece of pie.  [Okay, so we won't be hungry again until next Tuesday.] The choices were apple, coconut cream and cherry/pear.  No contest.  The cherry/pear [which the server said he had once enjoyed as part of a milkshake!] was really really good. A generous slice of warm pie filled with loads of cherries, hints of pear, just-right crust presented with a wall of whip cream and a scoop of heavenly ice cream garnished with a half-strawberry [$5.50]. Next time, no sharing ! Given that the menu is changing next week, these prices may change as well. But we had good food, excellent service, a chance to relax and enjoy the day, all for a very reasonable amount of money.   I'm looking forward to the new menu - and another chance at that pie."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and go here all the time. Not because it's amazing and delicious, just because it's... there. It also doesn't hurt that they have $4 beer specials everyday. While the people who work there are nice enough, and the location is great, I just find everything on the menu sadly bland. I like to get excited about meals that I just ordered, and that never happens at the Lakeview... For a city with so much variety and flavor their menu is utterly safe, without one single adventurous item.   All this being said, they *are* open 24-hours and have fueled many a late-night after-bar feeding-frenzy for my friends and I.... and the poutine hits the spot."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has the best diner-style food I've had in Toronto. Nice twists on old favourites. The Country Benedict is just crazy good: poached eggs on fried chicken with waffles and country gravy, and maple syrup. I would never have expected it to be as good as it was. Service was very pleasant, if a titch on the slow side, but it was busy and we weren't in a hurry.  Oh, and the $3 mimosas are a great addition to any meal. :-)"}
{"text":"Heard out this place from DDD and decided to check it out.  We got here for dessert on a Friday night. I ordered a latte and apple pie. The pie came warmed up with a side of whip cream and ice cream. The pie was definitely fresh and scrumptous!"}
{"text":"The Lakeview has become a staple since I moved into the neighborhood. Sensibly priced (from $3 drink specials to the whole menu), some interesting menu items (try the peanut butter milkshake), real retro art deco booths and 24hrs. It's hard to beat.  I have to highlight the staff too - great mix of mellow and affable but pros just the same. Haven't had a bad server here once (during dozens of visits at peak times).  My one complaint? The food could be so much better - even at this price point. Their poutine (curds, not cheeze) is great, breakfasts are good (but it's hard to screw up breakfast), burgers are good but, after sampling another half dozen dishes on the menu, there isn't much else I'd eat again. Ingredients (especially the greens) are sub par, and the dishes are just bland.   Avoid it on weekend nights unless you enjoy swimming in a room of arrogant hipsters with pedo mustaches, ironic naval tattoos and smurf hats while they yell about how different they are to each other."}
{"text":"I like this place...original-seeming (perhaps it is) old-school diner, tasty foodie-interpretations of traditional diner fare, reasonable prices/large portions (too large actually), and a decent selection of beer. What's not to like? Servers, while slightly aloof, are pleasant...and it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Once you get over the novelty of ordering an eggs benny at 3am, this place really loses it's appeal. The breakfast is overpriced and meh comapred to other breakfast places so it really baffles me why The Lakeview gets the attention it does as a breakfast place.  That being said, they've got decent beers and mixed drinks, and very friendly staff so if you're looking for a drink and a quick bite, you won't be terribly dissapointed."}
{"text":"Total dive.   But in all the good ways. Decor atrocious...ripped booths, crappy glasses, tiny falling apart bathroom.   But the food is decent, staff accommodating, menu extensive, prices cheap and portions huge.   Went for dinner at 830 on a Saturday with 4 adults and 2 kids. We started with $3 mimosas and $4 pint, then a bottle of red ($28, Ontario baco noir). For mains, 4 of us had steak (all perfect medium rare and tender but a bit salty), one had a burger with half-fries/half-salad and one kid had kids fish and chips with a side of mini pancakes. For just $17, I had an 8oz bacon-wrapped tenderloin with yummy mashed potatoes and swapped out the seasonal veg for a small salad of greens, goat cheese, beets and pecans. Everyone else had a huge plate of food for between $12 and $19.   Only bad thing was kids fish and chips...fish were inedible, frozen-type \"fish sticks\"....wish they'd warned us...they went uneaten. But it was $4.75 so I didn't send it back.   Overall: Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4.5 stars Value:4.5 stars. Id definitely return to try other things...their regular fish and chips, poutine and other diner fare looked fantastic going by."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Diners and Dives. One thing you have to know about me is that I LOVE DINERS! They have the best food and the ambience is always different. So putting aside the fact that I met Peter Gallagher there (The dad character in the hit show The OC), I managed to order two breakfast meals for my fiance and I . The food was really great although a peeve of mine is that I HATE soggy bread. I mean really, who like soggy bread? The order did take a little longer then I liked but they were also pretty busy, so it was kinda a given. But I was please with the food, so no complaints. The service was also great as our waitress was very friendly and had recommendations on what we should order, considering we were new there, I thought that was really nice. My girlfriend and I will be visiting here in the summer time, so I'm excited about their cute little patio section. Stay tuned for a follow up review!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Lakeview for almost 20 years. I'm afraid it has lost its charm and is now sterile and boring. I'm a bit sad to see the old Lakeview go.  The wait staff is way better; although there is something charming about the \"don't give a s**t servers they once had.  The food was average. I had a veggie burger with salad. It was OK. Lakeview is in my hood. I'll go to Lakeview again if the other restaurants on Ossington are too packed."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is a great place to eat in Toronto. It's open late.   After I am finished drinking away my sorrows, I can come in and order some poutine and eat away my feelings.   I really enjoy the pulled pork poutine. This week alone, I have had it 7 times.   I love that I can order it to go, because I am usually alone when I come in. I take it home and curl up on the couch and just cry for about 15 minutes. Then I check out my ex girlfriend's Facebook page, for what I tell myself will be 5 minutes, just to see what she has been doing for the last 3 or so years since we broke up. Then I slip into depression and lose track of all time. Sometimes I totally black out. Once I remember that my ex is now married, I decide the poutine is now at the perfect temperature and I begin eating as if there is no tomorrow.   More often that not, I am actually hoping there won't be a tomorrow. I beg for the sweet release of death, but it never comes. On the bright side, every day I am still alive is another day I can enjoy the great food at The Lakeview. So, if I have to continue to live in everlasting hell for now, I take solace in knowing that the poutine will eventually kill me!"}
{"text":"Honestly, like any restaurant, me and my partner have had some issues. The only thing that keeps us coming back is the bartender/server, Brent. His amazing attitude, genuine nature, and friendly personality, make every trip here fantastic. He's incredibly personal and really ensures that you have a pleasant time, both professionally and personally. Thanks Brent, we'll see you again soon for our late night disco fries."}
{"text":"Food is only okay but it's still a good spot for late night cheap and greasy eats. Poutine is a very small portion for the price. House booze, cheap."}
{"text":"Overrated. It's just a greasy spoon that's survived longer than the other greasy spoons with just the right amount of renovation to bring it to this decade.   The food was just ok. Not worth the rave people are giving it. My fish and chips, fish batter was to hard. I've definitely had better. Milkshake was just very average. Nothing there that I can get elsewhere or even make myself."}
{"text":"I read/heard about the Lakeview via a yelp e-mail. $3 Mimosa's...??? I AM IN!!! A friend and I headed there on our way to Little Italy for the \"Taste of Italy\", as we needed some food in our tummies before we gorged on cannoli's.  The $3 mimosa's were delicious and generously poured.  We shared a clubhouse sandwich with onion rings. The sandwich was HUGE, so amazing value. However, the cornflake chicken was thin, over cooked and tough as nails to chew. The bacon was good,but the mayo was skimpy and it made the sandwich a little dry. The onion rings were yummy...crispy and not over fried or dripping with oil.  The atmosphere was very diner-ish, which is fine if that's what you're after. The breakfast menu looked awesome, so I will try this again for some eggs."}
{"text":"About the only 24hr joint I know in TO that does passable food. The brunches are ok but I did have pretty much the worst burger ever there. It was just a distasteful piece of unseasoned meat on a platter-   this is a go to place when you are looking to soak up the alcohol at 3am...."}
{"text":"The place has a charm and a retro-feel to it. It has decent food and decent service offered at decent price. Recently i went there late in the night with friends for a few drinks. I was unimpressed with the drinks but the sweet potato fries were great. Last weekend, I went there for breakfast. The omlette was fine but the grapefruit juice was freshly canned and not freshly squeezed. There is nothing especially negative or positive about the place other than that it is way better than other 24 hour greasy spoons."}
{"text":"Decided to go here after not being able to get into The Hoof Cafe (which I probably will not go back and try).  Wait was not bad. Food was pretty good (salad was a bit wilted and potatoes were kind of cold).  Would go back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"The food has been less than stellar when I have been but the peanut butter milkshake is amazing! Cheap drinks and good selection make this a great neighbourhood pub."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a number of times, so I think I've got enough experience to leave a balanced review. First appalling experience: tried the poutine and the fries were not cooked through - they were rock solid, actually. On another visit, ordered the chicken and waffles eggs benedict with country gravy. Oh my god. Words can't describe how gross it was. Chicken was super greasy and cut way too thinly.... there was more crust than chicken. Ultimately though, it's open 24h and ready if you need drunken sustenance..."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. I was here at 2am on Wednesday night, but the place was packed. I realized why it was so packed during an odd hour once I tasted their food....omg.... You can't go wrong with this place!! I really like their apple orchard soda. It's Italian soda w real apple juice w pulps inside and it tastes super good.  The portion is very satisfying and the price is decent, esp considering that it is a 24hr place. Most food on the menu is priced under $15. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Was a 5 minute wait for 2 people, which wasn't bad at all. I had the cornflake chicken sandwich and it was really good, the chickens batter was amazing. Service was good, and i liked how they brought a full bottle of water to your table.   Lots of choices on the menu, it took a while for us to actually decide what we wanted.  For dessert, i had cherry brownie cheesecake, and it was amazing.   Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"So this is actually so messed up. I don't hate this restaurant, but I feel like I have an obligation to post this unfortunate negative review. I ordered wings and a salad and a sandwich from here for delivery. The wings were actually so uncooked and didn't realize till I ate two of them. I called the restaurant and was told that someone would reach out to me in a bit. Never heard back. So whack. So gross. Pictures speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Ordered my son a cheeseburger from here and he was given a dried out, crunchy piece of charcoal. Very unhappy with it. He began crying after biting into it and hurt his tooth and our server and a few tables started laughing. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We head to the Lakeview every couple of months because friends of ours have a three year old and it is perfect for the five of us. Most of our usual hangouts are simply too cramped to be comfortable adding a child to a table; the Lakeview makes it easy.  Who starts a review by not talking about the food? After breakfast this morning my friend said that as far as he was concerned Lakeview was the breakfast joint to beat. He loves the food, figures it is hands down the best in town. I replied that the reason we come here is because he likes it and it fits the five of us, and that I thought there were better breakfasts available elsewhere... but nowhere else that has the combination of good food (the food IS good, or I wouldn't eat it), great location and great staff.  Shannon was our server this visit and she was exactly right for the morning. She let us know about the specials, kept us supplied with beverages and was friendly and helpful.  You know what? My breakfast was pretty darn good, too. Pancakes that were perfectly crispy around the edges and fluffy inside with real maple syrup and a light strawberry coulis, to which I added a pair of sausages.  Across from me was the Ossington Massive (eggs, potatoes, toast, salad,three kinds of meat AND pancakes) and I would say that judging by the remains (none whatsoever) it was delicious. A pair of Bacon and Eggs and a kids order of pancakes rounded out the table and there was not much left at the end of it. Very nice cup of tea, for the record.  If you get there by 9 on Saturday you will have beaten the crowds and have your choice of seats. After eating, Trinity-Bellwoods Park is a short walk and makes a great start to the week-end."}
{"text":"A victory of image over substance   $68 for two good and two shitty brunches     Love the decor.  The food is another matter. I went for brunch with my stepdaughters on a quiet Saturday.  The place was mostly empty.  Service was attentive.  Our order took forever, though. When our food finally arrived, the omlettes were perfect.  The eggs. Benedict and the pancakes were not.  Both were cold.  The eggs Benedict went back to the kitchen twice:  first to be dried-out under the broiler then to be microwaved.  The pancakes were replaced.    When one of us talked to the server, he actually said that eggs Benedict \"are supposed to be a little cold.\".   Come on!  No adjustment on the bill."}
{"text":"Definitely a hipster hangout, but the breakfast food is decent and great for a late night food moment.  I had the eggs in a benny and was glad that there was a lot of food to sink my teeth into. Hearty rye bread with my egg in the centre, a side of greens, some fruit, and salty potatoes...yum! My guest had the disco breakfast and was pleased to see it was more of a breakfast poutine - two of his favourites in one.  The deep fried mars bar we shared was served to us cold, but the ice cream and fruit on the side was a nice touch.  Definitely not  a place where you can have a quiet conversation, but if you don't mind yelling at the person across the table, it's all good :)"}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to sit down for dinner at this 24 hour joint and try some of their famous menu items.    Pros:   - I ordered the apple pie milkshake to start and the novelty lived up to the hype. Not only did the shake taste like apple pie but there were good sized chunks of pie crust and apple filling in it. Delicious and definitely worth trying   - the service was good with our waitress being very attentive, friendly and not pushy about us ordering more drinks or dessert  Cons:  - I ordered the infamous lakeview clubhouse stack but wasn't overly impressed. The corn flake battered chicken was bland and lacked the crunchiness I expected. Whoever deep fried the breast may have overcooked it. The sweet chilli mayo on the sandwich was decent but there could've been more to make up for the blandness of the chicken.    Conclusion:  Although the cornflake chicken club was unspectacular the milkshake was delicious and the service was good. Their menu also has a wide range of comfort food, breakfast items and cheap drink specials. Whether for dinner or after a late night bender at 2 AM ill likely be back to give lakeview another try."}
{"text":"Go here for pie milkshakes but not the food. Service was slow, and my burger arrived with a burnt patty and cold fries. When I brought it up with my waiter, he wasn't very helpful. But hey, the Apple pie milkshake is a must try."}
{"text":"I've been to the Lakeview a few times now, although only after a boozy evening.   I was there on Saturday around 3 in the morning. The wait wasn't too long. Probably 5-10 minutes. I don't think we waited too long for service either. I'm not sure, I got pretty engrossed in the bottle of water they left on the table.   I had some kind of sandwich. I am pretty sure it was smoked meat, although it could have been pulled pork. The waiter also suggested half fries half salad, which I thought was weird (to suggest it, not the concept). My friend had some kind of club sandwich and got sweet potato fries (which are $3-4 extra which seems a bit excessive unless there's a sweet potato famine I'm not aware of)  I remember thinking the food was delicious, although, in that state, I tend to think everything is amazing. I just remember wolfing my sandwich down like I'd never eaten in my life, ever. Whenever I do go to the Lakeview, I tell myself I should go there sober, maybe during the daytime because the food seems pretty good and it's also pricy enough that I should enjoy/ remember it."}
{"text":"This review and rating concerns one menu item only.  And the rating reflects IMO groundbreaking value for money on the Toronto resto scene.  On the Lakeview's new menu, you will find a steak/veg/potato dish for a price that blew me away and will keep me coming back (full disclosure: I live around the corner).  A 6oz sirloin steak (quite enough for my expanding, middle-aged midriff, thank you) + mash/fries + a skewer's worth of grilled vegetables.  The bill? $12. Yep.  The most reasonable steak frites I've found in town.  Shhh, don't tell anyone."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is an institution and it's partly why I go there.  The food is hit or miss, but the Caesars never disappoint and they have beer specials.  The pies and cakes are usually amazing - my favorite is Oreo Cheesecake.  I've even bought a whole one before, because it is that good! Of course the line up after hours can be quite long, but at an off peak it's a neat place.  I've always had good service, no matter how busy this place gets."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Lakeview for the first time on a Friday night.  We were there around 7:30pm, we were seated right away.  I ordered the standard burger and 1/2 fries, 1/2 salad.  The fries were ok, but kind of cold. I'm not much of a complainer, so didn't think too much about it at the time.  But, recently having a burger and fries at Hero burger made me realize, how cold the fries were.  The burger seemed a bit charred, but actually tasted ok.  Salad was good too.  Ice cream sundae for dessert -  chocolate with caramel in a short glass.  I thought the menu prices were reasonable.  Waitress was pleasant and checked on us from time to time and refilled our water bottle.  Nice loungy kind of place."}
{"text":"This is my local for brunch, any time of the day. Food is consistent and filling. It might not be your faux 'lux brunch spot but if you don't want a menu description that is bigger than the food, then this works well. Solid satisfying food, good deal on drinks, and friendly staff - what more could you want? Just beware weekend brunch lineups."}
{"text":"Went here late-night in the winter. It was disappointing to say the least.  French fries were greasy and slightly bitter from the not-oft-changed oil. Burger was dry. Price was too high for what we got. I think that the only thing the restaurant has upgraded is the typeface on their menu, surely in an effort to appeal to the herds of migrating hipsters from Ossington.   I would be open to giving this place one more shot, perhaps in the daytime, but it wouldn't be my first choice by any means."}
{"text":"Because of my off hour work schedule, good places that are open 24hrs are hard to come by. Lakeview is the best of the bunch in the GTA.  ***Warning*** If you have an issue with hipsters, you will have issues with the Lakeview. Its full of them. Workers, patrons people walking by, they could all potentially be hipsters. BUT if you can get over yourself and say \"Who cares what others do, act, look like, or are labeled, I just want a solid meal!\" you will have no issues with the lakeview. ***What I'm secretly saying here is who cares about hipsters or any type of person you can label. If you do, you are basically closing yourself off to gems like the Lakeview.***  I've never had a bad meal here personally. I've tried multiple things on the menu and all have been tasty, satisfying and great value. My favorite thing to order is the Pie in a Milkshake. But any pie shake can be good if you pick the right ice cream to with it.   The atmosphere at the Lakeview is great. Music ranges from all sorts probably depending on time of day or who's ipod is hooked up to the system but its never too out there and never too loud either unlike some places in the city. The old feel of the place makes you feel like you are at diner you've been hanging out at your entire life. Im not the skinniest so sometimes the seating can get a little squished but its never been bad enough that I couldnt get comfortable. The walls have some great prints on them and change from time to time so its cool getting in there and seeing new stuff on the wall every now and then. The only issue I have with the structure part of the restaurant is the washrooms. I normally don't care, but the washroom at the Lakeview is an extreme case. Its tiny. Its fine to wash your hands, but anything else is a chore so go before you head to lakeview if you can.  I've brought multiple friends and family to the Lakeview when they wanted to \"eat downtown\" or \"go out for dinner\" with my wife and I. Its a great, not too trendy, not too foodie type of place that people who don't live our lifestyle will still feel comfortable at while allowing us to not stoop down to an overpriced chain restaurant to keep others happy.   Earlier I said I never personally had a bad experience here. However one time I brought a couple friends to the Lakeview and their experience was not the best. To sum it up, they were out of towers so they we not expecting the price of a meal to be that high. Certain cities in the states a meal can be had for what we pay for a drink here in Toronto. We also were eating there at 745 am on a Friday morning. Staffing was light obviously which could have led to some of the problems. Finally the icing on the cake, or should I say the gravy on the poutine. My friend was offered mushroom gravy for his poutine. He said yes. Americans are such rookies. Mushroom gravy is seldom used during peak hours and I'm pretty sure he was the first ever to ask for it on his poutine at 745am. He said it tasted watery and was chunky and I'm not surprised. It probably had to be reheated from yesterday's batch to get it on his fries in time. My other friend ordered the Mac n cheese balls which came out burnt first. They were replace very quickly but still,  they had to be replaced.   With the one negative experience I still choose to give the Lakeview 4 out of 5 stars. However, even without the negative experience I don't think I would give it a 5 star. The Lakeview just isn't that type of place to me. It's a great place to hang out after a movie, after a night drinking etc. I don't crave Lakeview food but i Iove being able to have a solid spot to go to any hour of the day."}
{"text":"The Captain Canuck peameal sandwich and Smoked Meat sandwich are sooooooo good! I liked my peameal sandwich more than the famous Carousel peameal sandwich at the st. Lawrence Market. Super juicy and not too salty. Would definitely revisit to try their Cornflake Chicken."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food at all.   BUT can talk about their awesome bar menu and super super super cheap booze!  I understand why the Lakeview is always packed to the rafters with students and hipster-types. You can't drink cheaper in the city.  Each day they have a different pint of beer special for $4. The afternoon I visited it was Blanche De Chamblay, my favourite wheat beer. They also have $3 mimosas, $4 well drinks (2 oz shot with mix) & $4 caesars.   How can you go wrong?  The decor is throwback diner, nice leather banquets, wood tables and framed movie posters on the wall. Service is good, our server was attentive yet casual and super nice.  A great place to meet up with friends, catch up and drink some el-cheapo hooch!"}
{"text":"Classic diner atmosphere at the Lakeview.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  They have an amazing veggie 'standard' burger! Will definitely be back another time to try one of their breakfast options and desserts!"}
{"text":"Bad service, mediocre food.  I asked if I could substitute tomato slice for home fries and was charged 4 dollars for it. To add salt to the wounds, they forgot toast with breakfast... WITH BREAKFAST"}
{"text":"Caesars...$4 Mimosas...$3 Featured pints...$4 Getting drunk on $11...priceless  This 24-hour diner serves up all-day breakfast, burgers, shakes, and floats to the gaggles of hipsters who stumble in late at night from the nearby bars along Ossington. But I'd go any time of day for the aforementioned cheap and tasty drink specials. They've recently extended the deals to last all night long (all night!).  On a recent visit I had a Caesar salad (meh, bottled dressing) and a sampling of some thick hot fries (good) and a panko-crusted deep-fried Mars bar served with ice cream (surprisingly not offended by this).   The food on its own wouldn't make The Lakeview a dining destination for me but once I've over-imbibed my taste buds tend to lower their standards, the way some do when deciding who to go home with for the night.  The service was shockingly good! The tattooed waiter and French busser handled our group of 9 like champs. (We were there at 7:30 p.m.)  Next time, I'm going to try one of their milkshakes. Apparently, they bring all the boys to the yard, and their like, it's better than yours."}
{"text":"Came in with a group (5 total) around 11:30pm. The service was much to be desired - our server wasn't very interested in hosting us and appeared as if he would rather be anywhere else. The food was much better than service though! I had ordered the apple pie milkshake which is a must have - there are actual pieces of pie blended in. Will definite be craving it / returning because of it. For my main course, had the spinach & mushroom egg sandwich. It hit the spot, however unlike the milkshake it will not be something I say dream about. (For those conscientious of the price, this place was definitely a deal!)"}
{"text":"Man, what a difference a year can make!  Came here for the first time in a year -  service is still awesome, but man the food has gone very south in my oppinion.  Got an app that was burnt, co-diner got a turbo with salmon and it had 2 loonie size pieces of salmon on it super thin, my panko mushroom burger was just two giant watery mushroom caps with almost no filling. It was pretty bad..... and only 1 year ago I was at a 5 star review with this place, wtf happened?!?!!?  I will take some time off, maybe another year, then try here again. But man, I am shocked the quality of food has slid down so much. Everyone in my party actually was with me when I ate here last year too, and all felt the same way \"What the heck happened?\"."}
{"text":"Ok, the food is not the greatest, but it is all the little extras that make up for it.  I ordered a coffee milkshake and it was really good.  The waitress breweed the espresso and poured it over the chocolate ice cream before mixing it.  It was amazing!  I ordered the tofu scrambler with salsa and I really didn't mind the food.  I was suprised that there is alot of vegetarian options.    This place is definitely hipster central and I will go back!"}
{"text":"Line up around the corner. Thought the restaurant was packed... Get inside and it's empty. Ridiculous. Waited for 20 minutes to be seated at a practically empty restaurant. Poutine was great.'"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have loved it. Great cool little diner in the Ossington area. My last stop was this past Saturday. Fast service, attentive service, but one very serious server. I ordered the standard poutine and a 4 dollar pint. Poutine was definately tasty and they used some serious cheese curds which made it feel authentic. My friend got the Pulled Pork Poutine and I was jealous as it looked fantastic. Cheap beer, reasonable priced food, great atmosphere, and a good starting point before hitting the Crooked Star or the Communist Daughter. The place is open 24 hours which although I'm rarely out past 12 PM these days in my life I can imagine would be quite handy for the Ossington crew after a late night on the strip."}
{"text":"Who can argue with 4$ breakfast caesars? If you want to argue with that, you can try a 3$ mimosa instead and see if that pleases your palate. This is one of my favourite brunch places - the food is good, it's bustling and comfortable, and what's not to love about the hipster retro decor?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places...if its 8am and I want lunch or if it is 6pm and want breakfast.  I've never had a bad food choice here.  Also love boondocks saints! I will always come back here no matter where I live in the city."}
{"text":"The Lakeview.  For all it's hipsterness and trendiness... I do enjoy it so. It's one of my default all night breakfast places that I hit up after dancing my ass off and drinking too much whiskey. The food is good, the servers are rad. The prices are warranted and not overly expensive. Lots of veggie options. Damn good sweet potato fries and veggie poutine with mushroom gravy that ain't too shabby.  A few are saying portions were to small? or have gotten less? I've always gotten stuffed there, plenty satisfied and this girl can eat, so no complaints on my end for portions.  And, once in a while, if you hit them up for brunch on a weekend, they have $3 mimosas. swoon.  Also, I dig the diner decor, vibe and attitude of the place. Oh, and it has a small patio in front.  That is all.  (Disclaimer: the whiskey maaay be why I like the food so much. But I have gone there sober and still enjoyed. wait. mimosas. k scratch that)"}
{"text":"Food was satisfactory. Better than I expected. Prices are reasonable and moderate. Our server was nice. However the lighting was very dim in there, and I wish they would maintain the diner's historic integrity more by getting rid of the hipster avant-garde pictures on the walls and crappy music with Coca-Cola signs and music from the 1930s-1950s. And the washroom needs some TLC, because the sewage smell is very noticeable, as if a dead body was there."}
{"text":"A late night stop at The Lakeview is a rite of passage for Torontonians. Last time there a group of three of us thought it would be a great idea to get the Deep Six at 3am. Regular fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, chicken wings, deep fried pickles, and mac&cheese balls. The heart-attack-on-a-plate is served with 4 solid dipping sauces: dill, bbq, jerk, and sour cream. Of course we then had to finish it off by splitting a deep fried Mars bar. Incredible decision.  Unfortunately there is usually a lineup at least from 1am - 3am, so you'll often start to sober up and realize what poor decisions you're making before the food arrives. The service can be spotty and the food can take awhile just because of how busy it is.  I've never been to The Lakeview sober so take my review with a grain of salt, but it really hits the spot after a night of bar hopping on Ossington."}
{"text":"After the party there's the after party.  That's how I ended up here with a group of Yelper's.  Truth be told, this review might not be 100% accurate due to the alcohol consumed at said pre-party.  I had no expectations of the food or the place, so I couldn't have really been disappointed.  The $4 pint of beer on a Tuesday night was actually delicious, and very nice touch.  I ordered the standard fare hamburger, and was expecting to choose between a salad and fries, however our cordial waiter suggested I get both!  The food looked great, from what I could see in the dimly lit restaurant.  Really hoping that the dim light wasn't hiding many indiscretions that wouldn't want to see in the daylight! eek!  The patty of the burger was lacking some serious flavour, and I would have loved to douse it in some hot sauce, but alas I remained cool and just enjoyed my burger.  The company was entertaining enough, I didn't need the food to make me happy.  I should probably try this place again for a different perspective.  I can say that the staff were great, and he checked in a few times to make sure everything was good.  Kudos to him for a job well done!"}
{"text":"A great place for a solid diner experience.  My friends and I were craving comfort food and stumbled upon the Lakeview.  Great prices for what you were getting. Nothing beats $3 Mimosas. I got the Fromage a Trois which was melted Asiago, cheddar and havarti on whole wheat bread. Their sides were great. You had an option of a mix of salad and fries.  I would definitely come back again for brunch with friends."}
{"text":"I was SO impressed with this restaurant! The breakfast was delicious and everyone was happy all around the table with their order. I had the salmon and caper Montreal bagel and it was to die for. The prices were great for the quality of food. The service was spectacular. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"*Food* The menu is pretty diverse with better than basic diner fare (breakfast items, sandwiches, fish and chips, salads, etc.) all of which are very reasonably priced and very tasty. Cornflake chicken is a top favourite of my group.  They have all kinds of french fries (coney island, various poustines, disco fries). All are amazing.   The portion size is very big for the price; you get great value and wont walk out hungry. The Lakeview is probably one of the most reasonably priced restaurants in the area in relation to its quality.   Service Service is quick, efficient and attentive. They are very accommodating of requests (they left me get half fried half salad as my side. Ive never had a resto accommodate this).  Decor 24 hour, sort of retro style diner (don't think 50's jukebox, it isn't that). Hipster heaven. Theres a bar facing old vintage milkshake machines, booths of various sizes. A lot of wood. Very warm and cozy.  *Things To Note* Open 24 hours - 7 days a week. (lineups out the door thurs-sat 11pm onwards, avoid!) Daily pint deals @ $4, 7oz @ $2.  $4 wine, caesar + bar rail & $3 mimosa every day."}
{"text":"I'd come back to this place purely because of their cheap daily drink offers - $4 (including tax) for a pint of King Pilsner! Food was alright; decent sized potions and not too expensive, I think I'd eat here again after I've been to a bar and drank copious amounts of margaritas.   Decor was very 80s. Blank white walls and wooden booths, it's not a place that would spark excitement just by looking at it! However, I think that's part of it's charm; no frills just cheap booze and comfort food."}
{"text":"Had the most miserable waitress today - short hair and a scowl. Didn't greet us, mumbled, didn't do a quality check and never thanked us. I only left a tip because the food came out quickly and was decent. There are so many better food options in the area. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was alright.  Drinks took a while to come...  Service was mediocre. Nothing spectacular.   If you're drunk, and just looking for a fast bite... You'd probably have a better experience."}
{"text":"I live very close to The Lakeview so I eat there more than I probably should. The food it touch and go. The Fish and Chips and chicken wings are \"meh\" but the Fungi Town spinach salad is very good. It has lots of mushrooms and cloves of roasted garlic in it.   Breakfast is also just ok. They serve it with a green salad which I usually ask them to leave off.  Since I usually go here alone I sit at or near the bar and the staff aren't very good about censoring their discussion about \"restaurant politics\". Especially bad at this is one of the managers who airs the restaurant dirty laundry very loudly. I don't really care since the gossip is interesting but someone else might not take to kindly to it.  Oh. The reason I keep going back? The PIE. Their cherry pie and apple pie is amazing."}
{"text":"Second visit and I absolutely loved it. The staff is amazingly friendly regardless of the time of day (or night), the food is consistently delicious and really well priced. I had the breakfast the first time and the Chelsea burger the second, absolutely what's needed to cure or stave off a hangover."}
{"text":"This place will rock your socks, and for more reasons than one; but primarily, because it is open 24 hours. It never shuts down. And its diverse menu caters to all things: from mind blowing slices of pie to fresh salads to satisfying post-drinking eats. The daily $4.00 pint price cannot be beat! We downed several pints and were astonished and pleased at how small our bill's total was. The fries I ordered were also really delicious, though the portion was rather small. All in all, a cool joint with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I've never been to a diner that has a security guard and lineup with upto a twenty minute wait before, even though in 2008/09 I was frequently at this restaurant. Went on a Friday after midnight and yep, lineup and security for a burger.... I had the Captain Canuck pea meal sandwich which was fabulous and my companion had the standard burger which they also thought was great. Our only complaint was that the sides, fries and salad, were so mediocre that they brought down the awesome sandwiches. Our server was great and we tipped well. He kept my coffee hot and it was really good coffee.  Their system with the lineup,  staff taking names to seat and security works really well. It's a 24hr joint in a central location with good food, the place is packed. The food I found was much better than Frans and the atmosphere was a lot more fun. Another patron outside said if you get the substitute/add on sides it is much better than the standard fries/salad, but really I should be able to order off the menu and not get 50% crap.  However, I will DEFINITELY be returning. Ps the place seemed to really calm down after last call and I can see myself hanging out into the morning on a date that I don't want to end. Cost was very affordable too, coffee and pop, burger and a sandwich,  two sundaes was less than $40."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. One time due to being drunk and wanting some poutine and mimosas (ya not a great idea after already consuming too much alcohol). Another was for breakfast, journeyed from Etobicoke.   I'll comment on the second experience since I can remember it more clearly. I met a friend around 9 am on a weekend, we had plans afterwards and didn't want to be late so we forecasted there would be a line of hungover people waiting to get in. Nope! No line, and barely anyone inside.  A table was cleared for us quickly, they kept the coffee coming and we got massive portions for a really fair price.   I would continue to come here if it wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. To be fair, I admit I have a predisposition to love diner type places (like shanghai cowgirl,) and the fact that I came here on a beautiful sunny day probably didn't hurt either... but come on! Three dollar caesars and mimosas from 9-5pm? That's outstanding!  Being the labour day weekend, this place was packed. Luckily, we were only two and got a table for two quickly but were informed that the wait for food would be around 40 minutes. Our server looked like she was being run ragged, but she was still friendly and managed to deliver the goods and take our order within a reasonable amount of time.  I had the smoked meat sandwich, with sweet potato fries (definitely worth the extra price to upgrade). The sandwich was absolutely fantastic and the fries were great as well. They were served with a chili-garlic like mayonnaise... Now, I still think eating fries with mayonnaise is kind of gross (in theory) but I have been hooked ever since having this combo on vacation this summer. Anyways, it was delicious. My friend had the french toast, which was pretty good as well.  So really, do yourself a favour and have brunch here on the weekend - they have a patio as well, which would be perfect for enjoying the last few days of summer. Top your meal off with a walk through trinity bellwoods park (the lakeview is just north west) and you've got the start of a pretty great day!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming in here, especially for those apple pie milk shakes. I live in the area so its always a fun diner to go to. The food is usually good but the servers are slow. Im not sure if they  are low on staff but i cant help but notice how I always get served extremely late"}
{"text":"The big bonus of this place is that it is one of very few in Toronto where you can have dinner late on Monday night. BUT: french fries seemed like it was cooked days ago, then frozen, then microwaved. Soggy - yuk! Coleslaw had such a terrible aftertaste that I felt like washing my mouth at the auto wash. Beer was good and cheap (2 bucks per pint!)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really.  It's always open.  The food is a bit hit and miss.  The drinks can be cheap (Jameson, Caesars).  It used to be a 4 star or a bit more.  They had a few great sandwiches when they first opened.  But like many places, the quality has gone down a bit.    Always a solid late night option.  Greasy food, check.  I would eat here anyday.  Would I drag friends from across the city to meet me here?  Probably not.  Unless it was for a few quick drinks and a cheapish bite before hitting the Ossington strip.  Not as good as many options down the street.  But quicker, cheaper, and far less of a hassle.  Cool staff = bonus,"}
{"text":"This may have been my first time here but it's hard to tell. The Lakeview is one of those places that you go to after the bar so I simply cannot trust my memory. The first thing I noticed when we walked (read stumbled) through the door was that the place was packed even though it was 1 in the morning. Then we sat down and the smell hit me. This place smells like urinal pucks and disinfectant. I suppose it's good to know that they use both products but, man, is it ever unappetizing. I had the club sandwich which was crispy and tasty and a bottled beer. It was decent, especially considering the time, but I don't think I would ever go here unless it was after visiting an alcohol dispensary."}
{"text":"Cornflake chicken breast is the way to go, brilliant!  Also the poutine is one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I end up at Lakeview at least once a week (bad habit, I know) but every time we go we are never disappointed.   The food is excellent, the service is attentive and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Husband and I usually go here for a late night bite. Most times we each get one of the 24 hour brunch options or the clubhouse stack. Both are pretty tasty but sometimes the portion size is on the small side and we leave still feeling a bit hungry. If you are doing take out I would recommend checking your order before you leave if you aren't into random undisclosed substitutions or items from your order missing. A couple of times I have ordered my salad dressing on the side and come home to find they didn't provide any dressing at all or the pancakes that are supposed to come with my order are missing. For random substitutions I once opened my container to find a slice of portobello mushroom instead of the potatoes I was supposed to get. 3 stars - not a bad 24 hour option with variety of things to choose from, just make sure they get your order right!"}
{"text":"Great during the day. At night's it is a complete gong show. They aren't friendly and they screw up a lot."}
{"text":"I was so satisfied with portobello mushroom benny! Also their sweet potato fries is now my favorite as its skin is crunchy, which I really like, and inside is soft!  Moreover the sweet chili mayo is very tasty~ ^_^)b Will definitely come again. Yum!"}
{"text":"Two girlfriends and I went for lunch today... This place has been on my bucket list bc it was on diners, drive ins and dives! Hostess/server told us she could seat us right away but it's a 20min wait for your order to even be taken, and at least 1hr for your food to be delivered to your table after you order.. we were extremely confused by this seeing as they seem to always be packed- we found it odd they weren't used to it or didn't find a jam to work out the kinks in their routine. For having such a great name in Toronto, I was upset with that response. When we got there they were pretty slammed, but they seemed to be staffed for it. Luckily our server came within 10 minutes and we ordered straight away, making our food come within 40mins. We didn't mind waiting bc we ordered two $4 caesers  (everyday!!!!! Amazinggg) each to hold us over, and they are yummy! The side mixed greens that is tossed in oil was not fresh, very wilted and tasteless. Dressing was great. I ordered the club sandwich with cornflake breaded chicken breast, bacon and chipotle mayo.. not much flavor in the breaded chicken. It was ok, as in I could make it at home. The French fries were yummy, and their gravy is to die for! Our server was friendly, however not much expression or urgency to serve us! My friend ordered the cornflake breaded chicken sandwich (sadly disappointed) and she deconstructed it to eat the chicken and dip it in my gravy. Second friend ordered basic bacon eggs and hash browns with toast. She got one slice of toast. Since when did that become a thing? Conclusion is sub par food and cheap drinks with ok service. Overall, not amazing. But it's stereotypical diner service I would say! I always give thorough reviews because I hope to help the place to improve, not for put downs."}
{"text":"Major bonus: it is always open.  The deep fried mac and cheese balls are super overpriced, but I'm not going to lie, They are freaking delicious. They have a great menu with a good variety (mostly breakfast-y/brunch-y type items).   A pretty solid place for some decent food. Again, it's always open. You can't beat that"}
{"text":"Walked past this place a number of times before venturing in as I was intrigued to see what a place that served \"24-hour breakfast\" can actually be like. I mean, was there going to tables for lap dancers or what?!  Sadly there wasn't even a dedicated nap area for the late night snackers. We were there in daytime though so maybe it changes? Who knows! Anyways I'm straying from the review...  I had the PULLED PORK POUTINE and it was good. A little bit too much gravy once you got to the end but it's a solid plate of food and ticks the box for being big enough.  As far as the BEER's concerned, they had pints of King Pilsner for $4 and every day there's a beer on for this price.  The DECOR is very plain and makes you feel like your eating in a restaurant that could do with something on the wall.  THE BEST PART about this place is that the bill comes already split and makes it ideal for big parties.  I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The wait isn't even an issue because you know the food and staff will make your experience worth it! The last time I was here was on Christmas Day and the service was amazing considering how busy it was (hour wait). When someone literally stole our table (it was that busy), the staff dealt with it immediately and got us our table back quickly and effortlessly. Would recommend this place to anyone especially friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Lakeview is ok. Like many other Yelpers I went here out of starvation, after an art show on Ossington ran late and nothing else was really open.   Disclaimer, I am not a huge fan of diner food - other than breakfast, so it would take alot to really thrill me.  My food was ok. The fries were ok. The service was ok. The prices were ok. The atmosphere, ok. See the trend here? Kinda underwhelming.  I mean, I don't know what to expect at a 24 hour diner, really.  I didn't indulge, but the drink specials were very good. Pints on Sat nights are $4.   The food was all a little salty, and the entrance smelled like old beer and lime juice. But, its open and I guess that is what counts."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me a decade of living in this city to find my way to The Lakeview (formerly Lakeview Lunch).  At any given time, you're likely to find someone with a toque or facial hair at this Toronto favourite. It appeals to Torontonians under 30 as the prices are fair and the hours are 24/7.   The Lakeview is great for brunch the morning after, or late night eats after the bar. Be warned: you may have to wait for a seat for brunch on a weekend.   Eggs Benedict are a safe bet, as is the club sandwich. Skip the appetizers and try a milkshake. Made with real ice cream, they are perfect for sharing. But the true show stoppers are the $3 Mimosas and $4 Caesars that will keep me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Like the Lakeview for its great selection of good food. You can take any crowd here at any time of the day and everyone can find something they feel like eating. Good food, fair prices, comfy without being boring, staff with personality."}
{"text":"After a 14-hour non-stop crazy day at work, my tummy was screaming at me to eat something!   At 11:30pm, I called up a friend and told him to surprise me. We ended up Yelp-ing best 24-hour restaurants and decided to check out The Lakeview.   We were not disappointed! I was actually pleasantly surprised with the diner, it had a great vibe, even at 11:30pm on a Wednesday night it was pretty busy! I was overwhelmed with my options - should I go for breakie since it was almost morning .... but I decided to go for a burger and poutine instead - wanted to catch up on lunch AND dinner. :)  The Lakeview w/ Poutine Lakeview - Loved the grilled portobello mushroom on the burger - Poutine was good, it had a mix of regular fries and sweet potatoe fries  The Abbott w/  Pulled Pork Poutine - Burger with smoked meat and I loved it with the grainy mustard, helped balance the saltiness from the meat - Poutine was the best part of the meal, generous serving as a side and it was filled with pulled pork! Really liked how there was pulled pork even when I reached the bottom of the bowl!  Very happy that I stumbled across this cute joint. Will definitely return to try out the pies and deep fried mars bar!  Cheers! - Trisha"}
{"text":"The Lakeview is the perfect spot to grab a bite and some drinks whether it's for a casual dinner with friends or a three am pit stop after the bar.  The atmosphere is great and the service for the most part seems good!  Good variety on the menu and they make a great ceasar.  Bonus - they have special drink offers every day, so if you're flexible, it can make it a lot easier on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Popular with people from the 'burbs who knoe that Dundas and Ossington is happening, but who didn't walk away from the corner. That's the Lakeview's bread and butter. Sorry, Lakeview, you used to be an okay diner, now I don't know what to call you.  I live close by but avoid the Lakeview - I'll go if people visiting the city want to go there. There's always something just not right. The food is average at best, though they'll try to make it gastro. The bar is nice and it's a friendly, chatty, classic, welcoming space, but service tends to be slow and if it isn't that something that should be hot arrives cold, something else is overcooked.   I wish this space would stick to simple and drinks and generally pick up the pace."}
{"text":"Okay so I am a diner fan (fanatic) but the Lakeview has lost it's charm. Yes it's true it was in bad shape when it shut down and is all shiny and new now - but that's what bothers me - I miss the old grunge, it gave it character. It's a little too sterile for me now.  It's still a great place for breakfast, I mean how can you go wrong with classic eggs and bacon. The coffee is a little weak - no sleepless nights with this mixture.  All in all I guess it's okay - food is simple and reasonably price but I want more. I miss the old drunks and ragged customers who use to populate the spacious booths"}
{"text":"The Lakeview is your typical diner with staples like brunch, burgers, sandwiches, fried food and comfort food at reasonable prices along with daily drinks specials.  I have only gone for brunches here and love their brunch menu and $3 mimosas.  It's a popular place on the weekends, so be prepared for a long wait about 20-30 minutes depending on the crowds.    Today I came for lunch with a friend and love the fact that it wasn't busy, perhaps 6 or 7 tables occupied.  Service is always friendly,  fast and efficient, always attentive, but never intrusive or overbearing.  We shared our meals today because we couldn't decide what to order.  Don't we all love friends who like to share?  ABSOLUTELY!  Fish and chips didn't look appetizing as the batter looked very crispy, probably due to old oil or perhaps a special batter they're using, but it was definitely way more than the golden brown that I like. The texture of the fish was a little mushy which suggest either frozen fish or perhaps fresh fish that has gone bad or maybe just a bad type of fish.  It wasn't terrible, but lacking in flavour, plus was not the flaky fish I was expecting, but nonetheless it was edible. Thankfully the wedge of lemon and  tar tar sauce helped.  Fingers crossed I don't get sick! The fries were done nicely, so no complaints there, whereas the coleslaw was a little watery and tasted very bland.  The Standard Burger on the other hand was absolutely fabulous and very tasty.  The patty was done medium and was full of flavour with a hint I believe of rosemary and thyme.  It was simply a mouth watering, burst of goodness with every bite.  The burger was served with half fries and half salad.  Salad was nice and simple with light vinaigrette dressing topped with sunflower seeds.  I ordered the caesar which was sweet and I could  barely taste the vodka, but for $4, I cannot complain too much.  I should have just ordered my usual mimosa or a pint special for $5 - note to self for next time.  Overall, The Lakeview is a neighbourhood gem with great service, good food and they're open 24 hours.  What more can you ask for?  Go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Lakeview countless times before but stopped in last night around 4:30am post nuit blanche for a bite before bed. I was with a group of 5 and were sat after a short wait. Our party got 2 tuna melts, one fromage a trios, a cornflake chicken sandwich and bbq wings. The tuna melts were good on rye, the grilled cheese decadent - but your typical grilled cheese on multi grain, the chicken sandwich was moist and quite large, but the wings were not well liked - too much breading. Food at the Lakeview is consistently decent, but not great. Typical favourites made with high quality food. The thing they seem to lack is originality and any sort of unique seasoning. A decent anytime spot with great drink specials."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Lakeview, and upon my first visit, I was initially delighted - open 24 hours, dirt cheap daily drink specials, and a handful of promising vegetarian options. Considering my first visit was at 3am, I was pleased.  I have since come to consider the Lakeview to be an institution of convenience, yet somewhat overrated.  It's hip and open all night, but the food and service seem to be consistently...okay. When it comes time to pay my bill, it never really feels like it is worth the price (with the exception of the milk shakes - those are delicious!!).   I've never gone there with the primary intention of \"drinking\", but if you treat the Lakeview like a bar, you're likely to be satisfied. Cheap pints, wine, caesers, and mimosas daily.  If you're looking for grub at 4am after a night of boozing and dancing, you'd probably eat damn near anything, so I'm sure it'll hit the spot.  If you're looking for a quality meal, there are way better places to get a little more bang for your buck...especially where breakfast is concerned ($9.50 for the standard bacon and eggs - yikes!)."}
{"text":"24 hours. Almost everyone's been here.   They've got daily pints for 4 bucks, mimosas for 3, pulled pork poutines, chicken sandwiches battered in cornflakes, punny names on the menu (Fungi Town, Chili Chili Bang Bang, etc).  The day-to-day food is OK. Nothing special. The ambiance is great for the price point, and service is sometimes slower than you'd like, but always friendly.  Only thing that really sucks: the men's room. Cramped (you will likely get hit/ hit someone with the swinging door while you're at the urination basket, and it can get grimy quickly).   The most fun you'll have here is late at night with a bunch of drunk friends and I'm going to go ahead and say it has reached ESTABLISHMENT status."}
{"text":"Nestled at the northern border of the gentrified SimCity neighbourhood known as Liberty Village is this unassuming gem of a diner.  You'll see signs in the area telling you that you're in \"Little Portugal\", and a short stroll westward on Dundas will certainly confirm this (incidentally, if you love steak, go to Salischaria Pavao nearby and ask for a slab of picanha--trust me!!).  My family and I had just enjoyed watching Toronto FC give up a tying goal in the 90th minute (again), so I did some research beforehand and found this restaurant on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  The wait staff were very pleasant.  Although we were there at around 4-ish, it was still quite busy and we had to wait for 10 minutes, no big deal.  The whole decor was quite nice, but this is no shi-shi-poo-poo place, despite its location.  Lots of old wooden accents on the walls and the fixtures.  They play a constant stream of music that sounded like ambient or acid jazz or something like that...sorry if I missed the right genre!!   The menu has something for everyone, it seems...from All-Day Breakfast, to gourmet burgers, to sandwiches.  We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Lakeview Poutine and the Fish and Chips, washing it down with a bottle of tap water (AWESOME!) a strawberry milkshake and a root beer float.  The Lakeview poutine was a mishmash of regular potatoes, sweet potatoes, bacon bits, peameal bacon strips, gravy and cheese curds.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  There are other iterations of poutine on the menu, but we went for the signature one.  The fish and chips were very good, but be forewarned...the menu says it's served with kimchi, which I thought was kind of interesting, but I was actually given coleslaw instead.  When I inquired about it, I was advised that they no longer served it with the F&C.  (Note to Lakeview:  Please change the menu to reflect this!!)  In any event, the Eggs Benedict were also good, as were the fresh-cut potato chips seasoned with cumin.  The milkshake and root beer float are diner classics, and these did not disappoint.  The price wasn't too expensive, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone heading down there."}
{"text":"Great poutine. The deep fried macaroni and cheese balls are a must-have. Leave some time for the hipster lineup you'll have to wait in, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"If you're like me you often find yourself looking for a good place to eat at 3am. Luckily for me, I live with a bunch of people like me and although we don't date, we do often go out to eat at 3am together.   Our latest late night grub hunt ended up at the Lakeview, a scene-infested all night diner on the corner of Dundas and Ossingston. My first thought after sitting down was \"I'm not wearing a tight enough shirt to be here\". Without question, this is home to Toronto's self-proclaimed coolest kids ever. I use the term kids loosely, as the crowd is mostly 25+ and at this time of night, most people are quite drunk...and loud.  After seating ourselves at a booth we found ourselves waiting an unnecessarily long time to get our menus. I use the term menus lightly as when we finally received ours they were nothing more than some disgustingly worn sheets of paper. Also, we found out waiting an unnecessarily long time is a bit of a theme here.   The menu is relatively simple; burgers, sandwiches, salads (probably) and an array of milkshakes. Being a scene-spot, the Lakeview of course only uses organic, free-range chickens that I'm sure consented to their own slaughter. There are also some all day breakfast options.   Even the menu itself is too-cool for it's own good, displaying prices without a dollar sign and rounded off to the nearest tenth of a cent (i.e. poutine - 5.5). I figured aloud that if I were to ask for suggestions from our uber-cool-via-outward-self-loathing waiter I would be greeted with an answer like \"Have whatever you want\". To test this theory I asked our fine waiter what kind of milkshake he might recommend and astonishingly, he replied \"Whatever you feel like\". Thanks...dick. I opted for the vanilla peanut butter. It was quite good, but like any milkshake, didn't last as long as you'd hope something that expensive would last.   For eats I went with the Lakeview clubhouse. It was epic. Wow. Complete with corn flake chicken that was crunchy, tender and well proportioned all at once, this truly is an excellent sandwich. With it I had the \"Yukon Frites\" (or \"fries\" to the rest of us) which were below average whereas my chubby friend Geoff paid the extra $2 for the sweet potato fries which were very good. Also of note is the spicy garlic mayo that is featured in the clubhouse. Damn good. Well done Lakeview.  I was told by a fellow food-lover to try the pie. When I mentioned this to our server his actual response was \"Yeah, I could get you a desert menu but we don't really have anything. They're changing it I think and last night I'm pretty sure we didn't have anything at all. There's apple pie I guess. I'll probably spit on it and you'll be infected with my indifference with life and silent hatred for this job.\". Not really, but still...dick.   Also, we had to ask 3 times for a refill of water and when we brought it up he replied, sweet as pie \"Oh, sorry guys, I didn't mean to keep you waiting.\". Dick.   Anyway, go for the clubhouse, try a milkshake, expect to be annoyed."}
{"text":"Véritable repaire des 'hipsters' d'Ossington Village, ce restaurant fut repris en main assez récemment et c'est une réussite. Ouvert très tard, la qualité y est constante et le service aussi. L'intérieur vous rappellera les bon vieux 'Diners' américains avec ses carrelages et boiseries. Le menu est particulièrement original, les vieux classiques des 'Diners' est relevé par l'imagination du chef.  Mise à jour (5 octobre 2012) : toujours aussi bon et ça mérite d'être souligné !"}
{"text":"i love this place for after work (3am) dessert and tea! (I don't drink) my coworkers and i often stop here after work and the staff are always pleasant and fun -even at 3am when I'm dead tired! props to everyone working midnights and still having fun!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch around 130 on a Saturday. Didn't have to wait for a seat. Ordered the freedom toast and vanilla and apple pie milkshake. The freedom toast was pretty good - was like French toast using a baguette with Brie and pea meal bacon sandwiched in between. Yum! The entree came with soft potato chips, greens and some fresh fruit. I don't know if I didn't taste it or something but I'm pretty sure the greens didn't have any salad dressing on it, just greens. I heard the milkshake was good here so we gave it a try and it was delicious indeed! A little deadly on the health factor but was worth trying. Overall, the meal was delicious and filling. A bit on the pricier end of brunch but the portions were very generous."}
{"text":"So absolutely fantastic.  Could only be better if they did nachos!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 3 because my 18yr old son loved his food.  He had the Plateau (a burger with an egg and a poutine). I had the bagal and lox with capers and cream cheese.  It was underwhelming and the fish almost looked ground and tasted like it was only a few hours from turning.  I would come here again if I had hungry teenagers to feed.  Definitely feels like a hipster dive afterclub 24hr eatery."}
{"text":"I've had several mediocre experiences at this place but when my sandwich came with half a pepper in one piece on it, that put me off entirely. Sure, it's a diner-esque type of spot but when someone in the kitchen lacks that kind of common sense, I can't swallow giving them my business. I'm assuming it's always busy because of the cheap drinks. But the food? Say it ain't so!"}
{"text":"Drunk food at it's finest. Drunk reviews at their finest.  Don't judge me, it's a long cab ride home to mom and dad's. Don't judge me.  Arrived around 2 and were quoted a wait time of around 20 minutes. I don't think it was that long. We were seated in a booth - stools at the counter were available, but I didn't trust myself.  My friend and I decided to split the classic poutine and the deep fried mac and cheese balls.  The balls were stinky and sweaty smelling and gross. I don't know what kind of cheese it was but it was funky in a most unappealing way. We do not like the Lakeviews balls at alls.  We do however enjoy the pout. I'm not one for pulled pork or sweet potatoes or chili in my poutine, give me good fries, good curds and simple gravy any day. They did, and I ate lots of it.  A girl was puking in the sink, which was unfortch, but beyond that and some nasty balls, a winning fourth-meal at The Lakeview."}
{"text":"This place is 24 hours, and the food is always great. It's not just crap diner food you want to eat at 3 am. Definitely try the chicken sandwich and get a milkshake if you can!"}
{"text":"Went for a stroll in the burgeoning hip Ossington neighbourhood in a recent trip to Toronto. I had been to the Lakeview years before, was known for a vintage setting, with bad coffee at modest prices. I understand it's recently had new management and that the menu has changed a bit.  I went for brunch on Sunday, arrived around 12:30/1 and there was a lineup out the door. I would suggest finding another place, really, it's only brunch and it really isn't worth the wait. You can find other places to make your eggs or waffles.  I was on my own so I dodged the crowd in the entrance to score a place at the counter, which, from an experience perspective, I prefer.  So to be fair, the place was really packed. I heard the people next to me complain about how long it took to get their food. I waited at least 30 minutes and just ordered the based eggs and bacon.  The food. The Standard breakfast is 3 slices of bacon, toasts, home fries, mixed greens, a few pieces of fruit and 2 eggs.  The bacon was somewhat crispy and greasy, and the eggs were perfectly over easy. The homefries, laced with curry, would have tasted good, presumably, if they were fresh. Wasn't sure how they could taste as bad as they did when the place was so busy (i.e., i would have thought the turnover meant they were fresh, hot). The homefries were mushy, almost watery, quite awful. I like the idea of the curry, but it just wasn't fresh or hot.  The bread (toast) was good, seemed like real bread vs. crappy diner wonder bread, but you only get 1 slice. The Standard comes with greens and a few pieces of fruit. I never really got \"greens\" with breakfast, particularly a greasy spoon breakfast like eggs and bacon. What's that about really? So urban.  There was only one person working behind the counter, servicing drinks and ice cream for the rest of the restaurant as well as those at the counter. As such, I was pretty much finished my breakfast before getting a refill on my coffee. This, while a gaggle of other young dundas hipster wait staff kibbitz by the water and coffee station.  The crowd was a nice blend of queen/dundas cool plus older locals (formerly queen st cool but now older with kids) and several groups north of 50.   WIll try the place again for dinner to see if it's different. I perused the menu, kudos to the Lakeview for supporting local wineries (the whole selection was Cdn) and mico breweries, with about 6 on tap.  There's no shortage of local options in this neighbourhood, or in Toronto, for brunch you can do better, for a less wait."}
{"text":"I've lived in Toronto for about a year and a half, and the Lakeview has become one of my standards.  It's got a relaxed (if somewhat \"scene-y\") atmosphere, the food is reliably good, if not completely outstanding, and there is a good pint special every single day.  My favourite time to visit is weekend brunch, but after the rush.  By about 3 they're back to \"seat yourself,\" and everything is much quicker.  $3 mimosas are strong, the coffee is plentiful, and only once have my eggs over medium been a little too well done.  I really like the breakfast potatoes - golden sliced fried and spiced just right. They have a pretty good variety of brunch options on top of their 24 hour breakfast menu as well.    The sandwiches at Lakeview are pretty reliable too.  The cornflake chicken (in both the cornflake chicken and clubhouse sandwiches) tends to be on the dryer side, but the chicken salad a la citroen sandwich is light and refreshing.  Overall, a great relaxed place for a meal and a cheap drink (though cocktails are not their forte).  And don't forget to wear your plaid."}
{"text":"I always seem to strike out here, no matter how I swing. My PBR-swigging, micro-brew-lovin', plaid-donning friends insist this is the best place to eat or drink in the city but I just can't agree. I used to come here on a weekly basis after my team's dodgeball games. Service was never better than okay, and I thought it was because we were loud & obnoxious.   I have a longer list of complaints than compliments for this place: - Food is overpriced. Yeah yeah, the menu is super hip and has cool names for things but it isn't anything special and I am always underwhelmed (Exception: poutine). $8 for a breakfast sandwich? Can I at least get some h-browns with it?! - Food is usually cold or undercooked(at least some part of it) (Exception: between the hours of 2 and 8am, from what I can tell). I guess my main issue here is inconsistency.  - Service is underwhelming. In speed and friendliness. Once I had a really nice server. Then she went to refill someone's glass and kept pouring until it was all over our laps. She was \"too stoned for that\". Got it...I'm really feeling some \"get the heck away from my table\" from your multi-coloured aura, girl. Another time, we had a decent server but I got the caesar I ordered with my breakfast after we got our food, ate, and then asked for the bill. Noone likes a parched Patty!  - Line ups anytime past 11pm. Seriously?! Ugh, fine. But only because of poutine.  If you're looking for a place to impress your hipster friends, this is it.  If you're looking for a cheap mimosa, caesar or micro-brew pint, this is it.   Oh: and bonus points for a scene from Boondocks Saints being filmed here.   Apparently I need to chill out and try a milkshake."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Lakeview today, as I often do either before or after I get my Haircut and Beard trim at Bellwoods Barbers (just down the road).  Today I had their Sausage and Caramelized onion Eggs Benedict! It was quite excellent to say the least. I pretty much get an Eggs Benny every time I go to The Lakeview, but it's usually the smoked salmon Benny that wins out. What can I say, I wanted to be different today.   The Lakeview was moderately busy, as it was a Sunday afternoon at around 1pm (prime brunch time). The table selection was slim at the time, so I grabbed a booth that would have seated about 6 people haha, my server was okay with that, even though I suggested that I could wait for a smaller table to be cleaned and move there.   Excellent service, plentiful refills on coffee, and a mouth watering creamy Eggs Benny with the savory goodness of Sausage, made for an amazing brunch experience.

{"text":"I went to the Lakeview for brunch and was surprised by the calibre of food from this diner.  I knew that they had 24 hour breakfast; but their brunch is pretty damn good.  Get there early on the weekend if you would like to minimize your wait for a table.  The tables turn quickly though.  They do accomodate large groups (greater than 4 people) if needed.  My standard 2 eggs + grilled portobello mushroom brekky was divine.  I loved the fact you had a veggie options to sub the meat options.  Service was great, not pushing and attentive when we needed.  Brunch for two with coffee was under $30 - I thought it was a pretty sweet deal.    I will definitely be back at the Lakeview for brunch and to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat at after a late night out or clubbing. Food is delicious and even though it's late night, they still serve you the best of the best. Cornflake chicken is one of my favorites and also the breakfast combos! Their fries are different from many other places and the salads is good too since they don't just serve you lettuce as the \"salad\" for your side like some stingy ass restaurants. Everything about this place is bomb, you're missing out if you have never been here! Only bad thing is if you just had a long ass night partying you'll probably hate waking for the food since it takes a bit longer than usual when it's around 3-4 am in the morning. Also it's very packed on weekends even when it's late !"}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch - $4 Caesars, $3 mimosas and $4 pint deals make it great for a morning-after meal.   I've only ever ordered the eggs Benedict but good every time. Crab cakes are decent and you can have them as a side or sub them in instead of an English muffin on any Benedict.  The only complaint is the service - The staff are incredible but the restaurant is incredibly understaffed which can lead to long wait times.  I will be back - often!"}
{"text":"The food is good and at a great price (3$ mimosas) but service was pretty mediocre. Our appetizer came almost 30 min after our meal and the waitress did not want to cancel the order. Other than that a tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"Late night dining while it can be enjoyable, is all too often questionable at best. Then as time progresses and the night gets later the level of enjoyable food tends to go down as well. Thankfully while in Toronto I ended up here. Had an amazing sandwich (Montreal smoked meat) and poutine. Both items were exceptional."}
{"text":"The Lakeview Diner has a long spotty history.  Its beautiful interior is a Toronto treasure that's finally been cleaned up with years of crap removed.  Along with the Senator and the Swan, these spaces take you back to another era.  As to the food, the new owners have certainly improved on a menu that got ridiculously out of control in past years.  A bit on the pricey side but the food is good.  I haven't experienced any of the issues some of the other Yelpers have complained about.  I've been coming here since the mid-90s and experienced all the changes.  This is definitely the best incarnation of the Lakeview to date.  My only complaint is the greens they serve with most dishes.  They can be of the slightly wilted variety and the overly tangy house dressing needs modification.  They do serve an excellent $4 Ceasar (the drink that is)  The service is excellent and its an old trusted standard amid all the new hipster hangouts on Ossington that won't last the decade. The area parallels Williamsburg, NY just as Manhattanites found out about it and ruined it."}
{"text":"Besides the boring and grumpyish waiter I had my first night dining at this restaurant the place was actually nice and my food was great. Light tasting and portion size was good. I'd go back! After a good night of drinks this is a good joint to visit or if you just want to meet up with friends for breakfast, brunch, dinner go here. It's also so close to home for me I need to go more often."}
{"text":"I'll be damned: Canadians have hipsters and they all hang out at Lakeview Diner! Plus, they're rude, thus shattering all my illusions of Canadians being a kinder and gentler people.  Oh well. I found about Lakeview from that fool Guy Fieri whom I loathe but am addicted to his show.  The poutine here looked amazing but after waiting 45 minutes to be seated, we learned that Lakeview was out of half of the items on the menu and that they only had the classic Poutine.  Boo.    The food was good and the poutine was satisfactory but this place was nowhere near as good as it looked on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives."}
{"text":"Affordable price drinks and an authentic and not-fake diner look make this a good drinks spot or to grab a quick bite at the bar.  On a Saturday afternoon this place feels comfortable, with the wait staff making endless Caesars at the bar, I decided to have the pint of the day, at a very affordable $4.  Friend had the famous apple pie shake, while I had the corn flake chicken club.   The shake was to be honest a bit underwhelming, with the starchy taste of the apple pie crust coming on a little too strong for my taste.  The corn flake chicken club hit the spot, with greasy diner style fries on the side, fried with seasoned dark oil, just the way I like it.  Crust on the chicken could have used more whole corn flakes though.  I would drop by again for a Caesar on the patio or in one of their cozy two person booths."}
{"text":"Here's a narrative: We were the only ones there when we walked in. The lights didn't seem to be on. The server seated us in a tiny booth and served us water, which she spilled all over my menu, saying Oops! and giggling and then walking away.  I ordered a decaf. The server said it would take a few minutes because it had to be brewed.  My husband ordered a coke. They had coke but no ice. The server got him a coke and then she came back with three ice cubes --I found some! she said. The coke was gross.  He asked for white toast. They had no white bread.  The food took an extraordinary amount of time to arrive. Two more people had walked in, so maybe this was a crowd for them. Overall, the restaurant didn't look like it got very busy. In some places, it looked like it was falling apart.  The food arrived eventually as did my decaf. We dug into our meals. I don't know if this is a Canadian thing or not, but both breakfasts we had, the one the day before and this one, came with orange slices we hadn't ordered. And the orange slices were delicious!  I ate some eggs. I looked at my husband. He had eaten some eggs. I asked, Do you like your eggs? He was like, Ummm... I was like, These eggs are gross. He was like, Oh, good, I didn't want to complain but they taste terrible. I don't know if they were powdered or old or the chef simply couldn't make scrambled eggs, but there was something really wrong with them. We ate as much as we could, and nibbled at the potatoes and I had some of my toast which was the best thing on the plate.  Then our side salads arrived. Yes, you read that correctly Our salads. The server was like, These come with your meal. And she put down two small bowls of salad that we could eat at 9AM. We did not eat the salad. We asked for the check. We left, kinda still hungry but too appalled to eat."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I usually don't like to review based on service but this was bad. We were told 5 mins, plenty of open tables, 2 ppl in front of us. Waited almost 30 mins as the entry way filled w ppl, all wondering what was going on. Once seated took a while to get coffee and order. Had the freedom toast, which came out semi-warm, very little cheese/meat, mostly bread. My husband had the chicken and waffles, the poached eggs were cooked through and there was very little gravy. Needless to say, it was very dry. We had waited so long and couldn't get anyone's attention so we just ate. Others who ordered the same thing looked very different, I think we just were unfortunate with our server/cook.  Definitely had potential, could have been great but was far from it today."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for late night visits. Try their milkshakes, they really are delicious.  I've gone a few times and always been very happy with my food. Most recently I had their disco fries- I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in just for milkshakes and they were excellent. I had a peanut butter black and white malted (personal mix, not on menu) and my wife had a mint chip shake. Prices were good, staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a staple. Decent food and AMAZING price drinks. I've come here just to pre- drink, to eat a meal, after the bar and for brunch. It is very popular so sometimes you do have to wait. The food is what you pay for but all in all it is a great time with a friendly vibe. They even have take out! Score! $Wine's $4 Caesars $4 Mixed Drinks!"}
{"text":"The lake view seems to change owners / menus more often than I change my tampon during a heavy flow.  I went in there one night due to a severe craving for pancakes. I walked in, did not bother to look at the menu and asked the gentleman at the bar \"Do you have pancakes? I am craving pancakes. I need some. I need some quick\". He replied \"We most certainly do.\" (or something to that effect.)   I sat down. My waiter took my order. I ordered pancakes. He walked away. He came back later and said \"I'm sorry the cook doesn't have the stuff to make pancakes they are not on the late night menu.\" Now, it's obvious that he COULD make me some pancakes. He's a cook, he just doesn't want to make them. It's like when busy brunch places wont poach your bloody eggs.  So I told the waiter to tell him I'd give him 10  bucks.  The waiter agreed and the pancakes were made.  The moral of this story is I paid 18 dollars for pancakes because I'm a fucking sucker and have difficulty ignoring food cravings.   The pancakes weren't even good."}
{"text":"Good service, decent food, and cheap drinks.  The Lakeview is a great place to grab a bite to eat or a beer after work.  Lunch hours are quiet, but it does get busy during the night."}
{"text":"**NB  Check the \"Rating Details\" on this place...seems to be going downhill lately**  9:30 on a Monday morning.  Had the standard breakfast...eggs over easy, home fries and toast.  (No coffee today...too hot).  Mine;  Eggs over easy - tiny eggs, weirdly folded and not hot Home fries - sliced thin, blanched in spice (mostly paprika) not hot Whole wheat toast - great toast, but not hot  Friend A;  Smoked meat hash - looked good, but dry, tasteless and not hot  (they also forgot to include the Chili Chutney which was supposed to come with.  Friend didn't notice until too late.) Poached eggs - not runny enough to moisten the hash, not hot Whole wheat toast - see above  Friend B;  Pancakes - tasty, but not hot \"House Made\" sausage - dry and crumbly, and not hot  The fruit accompanying each meal was OK, and the tossed greens were a bit limp, but tasty.  So to summarize, the food was not great, and apparently had been sitting around before being delivered."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and waffles eggs benny, and a mimosa. It came with home fries and maple syrup. My boyfriend got the turbo sandwich which came with the same. We both got mimosas and he got a pony of beer. Everything was so delicious!! Was skeptical because of mixed reviews but we sat outside on a beautiful day, our waitress was lovely and friendly, and the prices were just right. The mimosas were delicious, some of the best I have ever had (which I assume is because of the orange juice they use). Also they were $3, and my boyfriend's pony was $2. They serve breakfast all day every day and have these drink specials all day. Go there, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I went at noon with a friend. I was foot feeling like breakfast so I ordered the pancakes which were prepared to perfection. the pancakes were slightly crisp on the outside by fluffy on the inside. The berry coulis maple syrup combination was delicious.  My friend was feeling more like lunch so he got the Canucks sandwich which looked amazing and smelled great. I have to go back to try the milk shakes and the corn flakes chicken.   service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place SO badly. I mean brunch is the best, how can anyone mess up brunch?  Came here around 2PM with a few friends. The place was nice and cozy and had tons of space.  Ordered pancakes, eggs benedict an omelette and apple pie milkshake.  We received our shakes. The cool thing about them is that you're also given another cup with leftover shake. The apple pie shake was amazing.  Let's start at 5 stars.   The food took way too long to come out. Despite the extra milkshake we were given, we ended up mostly finishing ours before we received any food. Even then we had to tell ourselves not to just finish it up even though we were hungry.  4 stars.  The pancakes were huge and thick ... but burnt. My friend couldn't finish it. The omelette was loaded with pesto. It was practically a pesto omelette, not very appetizing at all. I enjoyed my portobello eggs benny a lot but my friend who got the Lakeview did not like his at all. There was waaay too much lime and you couldn't taste the crab patty because of the sauce. He ended up scraping it off and ultimately leaving it unfinished.  As I said, I enjoyed my portobello eggs benny. I really liked the fried potato slices it came with and it was a lot of food. The food was far from the worst and the portions were great, but the amount of problems definitely did not leave a good impression. The best part our meals was probably the salad..  3 stars.  We asked for the bill, the server said alright and took away our dishes. We waited for about 15 minutes until a different server asked if we wanted the bill. Really? Whatever. We pulled out our cards and asked for the machine. He said ok and went to get it.   Another 10 minutes went by. I looked around the restaurant and it was hardly full. Many of the waiters and waitresses were standing around socializing. We eventually got up to see if we can just pay at the front when our server asked if wanted the machine.  Poor service despite having so many servers during off peak hours and mostly unappetizing food.  2 stars."}
{"text":"Remember when this place used to be a dive? A terrible but conveniently open at all hours dive? Well... it's cleaned up it act!  Now, it's not just decent but actually pretty good... Brunch is the specialty - as with all greasy spoons, no? The Lakview offers a good standard menu but an even more exciting rotation of specials:  Waffles and chicken? Yes please.  Steak and eggs benny? Yum.  I've been for dinner and I agree it's okay... but as far as greasy spoons go the food and atmosphere are better than others in the 24hr diner category like Fran's or Mars. Perhaps it's not a date night kind of place but it is definitely the best in class."}
{"text":"We decided to do something a little different (atmosphere wise) for breakfast! We weren't disappointed! From the \"OLD SCHOOL\" diner setting, personal booths for two, to booths for four, all the dark cherry wood (EVERY WHERE) and the serenading of classic diner music, WOW! major flash back! The service was prompt, courteous and friendly, The food as we both ordered Eggs Benedict( done with a twist of caramelized onions and bacon put on the English muffin before everything else) served with home fries and greens on the side! Coffee was \"AWESOME\", second cup for sure! The place is open 24hrs. and according to the staff, over night is the busiest (all the bar and club people need some where to go for a mid-night snack). The Lakeview is more than worth the drop in, you'll see! Plus you will need a second or third visit in order to work your way through the menu (BOTH SIDES OF IT) bon-appetite!"}
{"text":"This historic diner with 24 hour brunch,sandwich, burger,breakfast and more has a warm feel. The Lakeview burger with portobello mushrooms and crispy onion ring on top of the burger is a good choice if you like a simple burger. The seasoning of the burger makes the burger stand out from other burgers around downtown.  The fries were soggy  because most likely were sitting while the burgers were being made. I was happy with the service but felt that waiting an hour for a burger was ridiculous. Overall it's a decent place to go after the club but not for dinner time."}
{"text":"Solid menu - lots to choose from and everything is done pretty well.  Service is usually really good - the staff seem friendly and chill.  Great neighbourhood place and open 24 hours which is nice.  Breakfast is busy so unless you want to wait - try to go early or just avoid during those times.    This place used to be a real dive and made me very sick years ago before new management took it over.  They use to have mayo just sitting out on the table all day.  ugh.  Thank god it was taken over by folks who have maintained its charm."}
{"text":"Do not expect a decent breakfast if you're here early. We arrived at about 7:30 on a Sunday and were too early for the normal menu and had to settle for the 'all-night' breakfast menu. We had a standard breakfast (eggs, meet side and potatoes) and it was absolutely horrible. The potatoes and meat sides had clearly been out under the heater all night. They were completely dried out and inedible. I ordered sausage, but received bacon. When I pointed out the mistake, the waitress went to the kitchen and returned 2 seconds later with the sausages, which confirms our suspicion that everything they serve at this time has just been sitting out all night."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends for breakfast. 20+ minute wait for seating, but whatever, that's fine it's busy.  Service is good, no fault with them. The food however:  I ordered the regular breakfast. Friend ordered the large breakfast. The other ordered just toast and salad. My breakfast literally had seven potato chunks as my side, one slice of bread for the toast, two eggs and some thin slice of half ripe fruit. For about $14. The large breakfast my friend ordered, hoo boy. Her baked beans extra side was in a tiny cup that couldn't have held more than a quarter cup of Heinz canned beans. I've made \"homestyle baked beans\", and it's pretty obvious they didn't do more than open a can and heat it. The pancake short stack was three of the tiniest pancakes I've ever seen. She got a single strip of bacon and a slightly larger slice of ham.  I'm adding one star because none of us got sick, but for the price compared to the quality and absolute lack of value, they're at 2 stars. We're not huge eaters but all of us were still hungry after. Or maybe I'm just spoiled by places like bons on Broadway in Van where you actually get a meal for less than five bucks.   Heck, this breakfast wasn't even as good at twice the price as what you'd get in the Zellers diners back when they existed."}
{"text":"Average Diner!  Guy Fieri finally made it to Canada (Toronto) so we wanted to try this place as it looked like a git.  It is a vintage old school restaurant with a great charm and feel, the service was a bit slow but friendly.    I ordered Corn Flake breaded clubhouse with fries and my wife had the Pancakes.  Overall I was not as impressed as I hoped, everything was average. The chicken was overcooked and they did not have enough sauce for flavor on the sandwich, the fries were homemade and good.  The pancakes were standard, they were not unique in appearances or taste.  Possibly we hold the Diners Drive in's and Drives to a higher standard, if this was a regular joint in a small town possibly our review could have been better.  Try it out for yourself and enjoy the great vibe in Little Portugal!"}
{"text":"I've spent many nights yelping 24 hour places close to my house and only coming up with 7 West or Fran's.  I know there are more than those two, and now I've finally found one.  I was certainly a bit sad when it closed, but since I went yesterday, I'm now definitely going to make it one of my \"third places\".  I spend many nights working late, so having a place where I can set up my laptop and have a coffee and snack is absolutely crucial.  I've only had the soup there so far, but I was definitely impressed.  I'm from the school of judging people and places by the simple things, so I be going back there soon and often.    As a note, I realize that they didn't renovate with late night laptoppers in mind, since they have no internet and only one plug.  If I could make a suggestion.. get wireless internet and try to accomodate laptops, and you'll reap the rewards within the first week."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is everything you could ever want in a diner: open 24h, cheap, cozy but roomy, great drink deals, and generally noms. It's the kind of place I would make \"our place\" if my friends and I were diner people.  The 24h brunch can be a godsend on a late night, sober or not-so-sober. The milkshakes are legit and delish (and probably 90% ice cream). The drinks are cheap and (can be) alcoholic. The servers are friendly and helpful. And they have bottomless coffee to boot. I'm a fan of the omelette, and they also do a mean root beer float - but so far, they've never gone wrong with anything I've tried.  The Lakeview is a staple. I may not be a diner person, but if I were, I would be a Lakeview person."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting breakfast - eggs tasted as if made from power: watery, no eggy taste at all, bacon was limp and I had to have it replaced (our waiter did so and he was the only good thing about the place that has gone downhill big time), joke of 2 small pancakes, nasty dry maple sausage. Won't ever return."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 5+ years, and it's always been a dive, but it's gone really deep dive lately. Got jerk wings today, 1lb, and it was 6 wings. 6? Come on. They were super small too. I said something to my server/bartender and they did nothing to remedy the situation. Just mentioned that the kitchen is understaffed and it's been a rough weekend. I get it. I do. There's a very short supply of cooks in this city. It's just how things are, but this place is clearly very poorly managed. I've typed this whole review while I've been sitting here, with cash in front of me, waiting for the bill that I asked for 15 minutes ago, while multiple staff have walked past several times. Maybe they're going to comp my coffee?"}
{"text":"This place will forever be a hit or miss for me. First off if you're going there at a normal time - say around 6, it's probably going to be great. But if you're like me and you only go when the bars on the Ossy-Dundas strip close then you're taking your chances. Service is always up in the air, but at the same time they do have to deal with all of the drunkies. I get that.  My go-to meal sober or not will always be the cornflake chicken sammy. Oh and I always get half salad half fries- because I'm half healthy. I've heard the milkshakes are also a must try!  All in all, It is a super cool place to check out if you've never been before, and it's open 24/7 so you really don't have an excuse, Do ya?"}
{"text":"I am saddened to give this very low rating... but I felt I needed to as fair warning to those who have never been to the Lakeview or have not been in a long time.  When I first moved to Toronto in 2012 the Lakeview was my go-to. I took family, friends and visitors there whenever I could. I loved the menu, the 3$ mimosas, the fun staff and of course I was addicted to Freedom Toast :) I moved to the other end of the city so alas the Lakeview was no longer my local hotspot.  Fast forward to today, New Years Day. My boyfriend and I decided to be nostalgic and hit up our old favourite. I am still in actual shock over how horrible the experience was from start to finish. Please also keep in mind we went at 4pm, not an unusually busy time. To make a long story short:  - When we arrived it took the hostess a good 10 minutes to greet us as we stood around awkwardly, having no idea who had already been assisted  - When we were finally seated it took another 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take our order  -We waited 45 MINUTES for our order (Freedom Toast and a burger with fries). Our server did not come by ONCE to ask us how we were doing, if we needed anything etc. When the table behind us (who arrived 15 mins after we did) got their food, I had to stop the food runner and ask where our food was  -The runner got our server for us, who informed us that \"there was a mistake\" and our food was never ordered. It wasn't until this \"mistake\" was made that we finally got attention from our server  -10 minutes later, food arrives and it is the COMPLETELY WRONG ORDER. When I told this to our server he said \"oh sorry this is another table's food\" and we again waited.  -When the food finally arrived, it was such a huge disappointment I seriously almost cried from just hunger, exhaustion and frustration. The beautiful Freedom Toast I once knew and loved was no more. Instead I got 3 TINY undercooked baguette slices, cold, hard, overcooked hashbrowns, underdressed salad and no fresh fruit. At this point I just ate it out of hangriness.  -I also need to note how absolutely filthy the ladies washroom was. The sanitary bin was open and overflowing with used diapers, the hand dryer was not functioning and there was paper towel all over the floor.  The restaurant comped our meal but honestly I cannot believe how far downhill this place has gone. I overheard a server tell another group of patrons that they were \"really swamped\" today. Ok, I get it, but that should not be an excuse for the drastic decrease in the quality of service, food and cleanliness I witnessed today. I would hope that with their recent popularity that they would not become complacent, but it seems that way. It makes me so sad to say that I will never again come to the Lakeview."}
{"text":"The best late night food you could ask for. Classic diner atmosphere, matched with huge flavorful sandwiches and amazing milkshakes. I personally recommend the cornflake chicken, captain canuck and the clubhouse stack. The apple pie milkshake is to die for."}
{"text":"Last time we were in we were served by a lovely bearded fellow who was down to make mimosas for my squad of giggling twenty somethings, and helped us with the menu. (Several vegeterians and food allergies in our group.)   There's a great selection of taps and honestly even if you aren't a vegetarian I recommend the mushroom gravy disco fries. I kept stealing my friend's!   Overall had a very lovely time. A great spot for last call post-karaoke comfort food!"}
{"text":"Very hipster-eque diner serving a hipster crowd in a fairly hipster neighbourhood. It was a really mixed bag when I came in to Lakeview on a spur of the moment kind of deal with one of my good friends. Service wasn't very attentive but was great when our server actually talked to us! The drinks and the drink specials (daily $4 pints and $3 mimosas!!!) were awesome especially for a girl on budget like me. Also if you order a milkshake they provide you with the metal shaker they used to make it along with remaining bits of the milkshake that didn't fit in the glass! Perfect for some milkshake sharing!   For food, I ordered the chelsea burger which had an onion ring inside which ironically ruined the burger for me because it was so stale that I couldn't chew through it when I got to it in my burger. Also the burger patty was fairly tasteless. Might be because I have become a bit of a burger snob. Not sure. I did however like the fact that I can split my side to half salad half fries. Salad was awesome with a great vinaigrette dressing and the fries were also really well made. Sigh, if only the burger was better.  Overall this place is alright if you go out of inconvenience. Wouldn't really go out of my way for a visit though."}
{"text":"Corn flakes burger undoubtedly amazing (also featured in diner drive ins)"}
{"text":"There are few places other than my bed that I like to stumble to in the middle of the night... this place happens to be one of them. Between the ambiance of establisment and the prefect greasy spoon eats, I couldn't think of a better place to get my post bar munch on.  I am a sucker for poutine so for me, the Lakeview Poutine is probably my favourite thing on the menu.   For a place that's 24 hours and is sure to see a few interesting characters, the staff there are always friendly and pleasant.   It's a definite thumbs up from this yelper!"}
{"text":"Been twice, won't go a third time. What a dump! Don't come here for the food. This was my first time here and I was drawn into this place as I drove by because of the styling. It looks like a very old style diner which it is and for that you wont be let down. I do like the décor. The food borders on awful. If you notice the other reviews, a lot of them talk about how cheap the booze is, $4.00 cocktails etc... I think that's what keeps the place packed and with good reviews. Have a few cheap drinks and I don't think you will care about the food. One star is generous. I don't drink so I have expectations when it comes to food and this place meets none of them.  UPDATE: I've now been twice, had the shepherds pie, looked like puke in a bowl.. Tasted awful, looked awful. Anyone that uses the word amazing for this place is either an alcoholic or first time outside MacDonald's.  I know I just insulted a lot of people but the food here is garbage recycled."}
{"text":"Nice place to get some comfort food any time of day.  Good deals on mimosas, ceasars and beer... Everything I've had here is pretty good and I've not had a bad experience service wise either. It's no wonder this place has been here so long."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight.  Very disappointed! Our waitress was very nice but forgot everything we ordered. We ordered 2 beers, she forgot them. She apologized. We then ordered dinner, club sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Both very good (except the fries were raw inside) and came out reasonably quick . I ordered another beer (same as my first beer), she even asked if I want the same, and I said yes. Another waiter brought me my beer. Completely different then what I ordered. Then we asked for the dessert menu as well as a decaf coffee. The dessert came, ordered the chocolate cake. It was stale.  The coffee.....never came. Not even going to mention what the washroom looked like. All I can say is yikes!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never written a review of the Lakeview. It's an institution.  I like the diner style , the food is always decent if not amazing and there are always cheap drink specials of actually drinkable beer.   A lot of places on the Ossingnton strip are hit or miss and fly by night so the Lakeview wins if you don't want to guess how the quality of your pint or poutine will be."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and just love this place, excellent food, fast service, open 24hrs.  Its and old style 50's diner and the interior has not changed much since.  It's clean, and well kept for a restaurant that busy and of that age.   The eggs benedict are fantastic, even down to the super tasty side salad, just absolute perfection, everything else is really good including their poutine of course. really there's not much else to say other than, if you enjoy a classic comfort food meal in a well run 50's style diner at literally any time of day, then the Lakeview is the only place worth going, i'll be back again and again..."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot. The food is amazing and portions are huge for the price you pay. Some menue items you have the option of upsizing too for minimal costwhich is great. They have 3 dollar mimosas and 4 dollar ceasers which is unheard of at most brunch places: service was very friendly and checked in frequently, the only downfall was the long wait to get  a table and our check which is common at any brunch location on Sundays."}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday night, not sure why... hungry and it was either this or Tacquitos from 7-11.   Sitting at our booth my friends and I noticed a mouse scurrying around on the floor.... when brought to the attention of our waiter he said \"oh joe he's harmless\" Harmless indeed.... cheque please!"}
{"text":"Very misleading dessert menu, advertises pie for $2.50 with a milkshake BUT this means half a slice put in the milkshake. Doesn't say that on the menu and no normal human being could deduce their bizarre policy from what's written on the menu. Managers explanation: that's the way it is. So sod this place and the manager too, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING LIED TO."}
{"text":"Food is average, the Caesar is delicious and for $4 you can't go wrong - ask for horseradish! They've got some really good drink specials going on."}
{"text":"Fun and friendly staff. Good food. The apple pie milk shake is divine!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the Lakeview for dinner after hearing some positive feedback from friends, and it turned out to be a great place to catch a quick meal. They have $4 pints and glasses of wine (uh, wow!) as well as all day brunch, which are definitely 3 of my favourite words in the English language. I got the freedom toast, essentially stuffed french toast, and it was a good price, quite yummy, and a generous serving of food. The server was very friendly and the ambience was fine, although the booth we sat in wasn't the most comfortable and the entire table was vibrating softly for some reason. Didn't really take away anything from the meal, but it was certainly odd and made for a good conversation piece at least.   Knowing that they serve cheap booze, reasonably priced food, and all day brunch, I will definitely go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Being that I am a Torontonian living in NJ, I claim to know a thing or two about diners and poutine (and no, disco fries are not even close)  We came on a weekday morning, easily found street parking - but avoid the Bloor and Ossington area at all costs - they are tearing up the streets!  The place was not crowded, our server must have been so happy we were there, he was always smiling and friendly! We had poutine, peameal bacon and a smoked meat omelette for breakfast! Each item was equally delicious and well prepared, kudos to the chef for frying up the smoked meat first before placing it into the omelette. A perfect fluffy omelette not heavy or soppy! Mimosas and Caesars also excellent ( no babe - we are in Canada it is NOT a Bloody Mary - it's a Caesar damn American BF)  Also, this place is beautiful, it looks like all of the original wood moulding, benches and perhaps the tables too! Will be back the next time I am back home!"}
{"text":"Went here after a all day business event. Should have checked how far it was from downtown before heading out but no biggie. Got there, had I would say a bouncer? Lol outside which was really odd and honestly a huge turn off. Hubby was hungry so we stayed and stood outside for 30 mins. Once we got in the food made up for it. He ordered putine and I ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich. It was great, bread was good. The frys were amazing, our server was great. Will be back more prepared next time to be eyed down by the guy at the door lol"}
{"text":"we got seated right away got our water right away..no time to bring out our wings with 3 sauces.our main dishes took more than an a half and hour"}
{"text":"Late night hot spot. I've had to wait in line here a few times but it's so worth it.  It's a lively sit down for some post bar snacks. Such a good alternative to takeout if you want the night to continue. -Disco fries are insane. -Lakeview poutine is delish."}
{"text":"For rich, sinful milkshakes and a meal that'll leave you full and perhaps overfull, this is the place. Mind you, I haven't given their healthy menu items a try (how could I when there was a milkshake with a 1/2 slice of apple pie mixed in?). Solid food, good service, nice booths."}
{"text":"DEEP FRIED PICKLES. Vanilla milkshake. Open late.  Shitty service. Gross salads. Long waits."}
{"text":"Been here twice for brunch and both times were great.  Simple diner where the food is obviously not anything extraordinary but no complaints.    Recently I tried the turbo brunch with spinach and mushrooms.  Combined with the English muffin (toasted just the right amount), cheese, and egg, it was exactly what I needed at 1am!  Bonus - the fries and home fries are great.  Also tried the apple pie milkshake.  Not sure what I expected, but it really just tasted like a vanilla milkshake and they threw in some random cooked apple pieces from their pie.  This was HUGE and is definitely a drink meant to be shared."}
{"text":"honestly, the last two times I've been to this place have been BRUTAL. It's taken over an hour after the fact of us ordering for us to ask about where our food is to get some sort of excuse. This time it was that they ran out of gravy! So unfortunate because both times we have sat there for over an hour disappointed while some of the people around us received meals. We really tried to give this diner a chance but both times we walked out hungry and disappointed. Will not be returning which is super unfortunate because the menu looks amazing. Terrible service"}
{"text":"Come on. You only come here when you are too drink to taste food. Horrible food. Dry, uninventive.  Gotta give it 2 stars for the look of the diner. Server tells me many movies have shot here. I don't want to come back. But I just might have to if nothing else is open around that time."}
{"text":"We came here after I saw it on Diners Drives n Dives. After seeing the show I decided that I had to try their apple pie milkshake. The milkshake is made with actual apple pie. The milkshake portion was huge. The milkshake was thick and creamy, you get chunks of apple pie, but the apple pie flavour didn't really come through. It tasted more like a vanilla milkshake with a hint of apple pie. I think my expectations may have been too high as I didn't love the shake.  What's awesome is the diner serves serve brunch all the time! Since I love brunch, I got the Portobello and baby spinach benny. The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy. The Portobello mushroom gave the benny a nice texture, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The dish comes with fresh fruit, potato chips, and salad. I enjoyed this dish.  I also tried the Captain Canuck sandwich, which comes with peameal bacon, lettuce, tomato, sweet chili mayo on a Kaiser bun. The peameal was cooked nicely, and the bacon was juicy and not tough. However, the Kaiser bun seemed to dominate the sandwich a bit too much.  I love the décor of the place it feels like an old school diner."}
{"text":"Definitely a guilty pleasure.   After any overpriced, underwhelming dinner in Toronto that leaves you hungry  there is nothing like Lakeview poutine to fill you up.  (If you're REALLY hungry get a milkshake too)"}
{"text":"The Lakeview is my dodgeball team's go-to location for after-game eats, which makes me sad because I can no longer go with them.  I am always disappointed when I go to the Lakeview. I don't know if it's the apathetic servers who make me feel like I'M bothering THEM when I have to wave them down for our bill, the mediocre food (bonus: not a lot to choose from for vegetarians) and high food prices. You know it's a bad sign when the person you're with is friends with the owner and you still get the worst service in the city.  I don't even think I could be dragged to the Lakeview again, even for their $3 mimosas. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's always open, so if I'm ever chased by wolves at 4 am down Ossington, I will consider stepping into the Lakeview to save my life."}
{"text":"I know I should like this place but I REALLY REALLY don't. It reminds me of an indie Denny's.  I wouldn't even call this place better than Fran's.  At least Fran's has tackiness to it.  this place tries to be a little cool.    I hate the service here.  I've been here a few times with groups of people and the servers here just seem to really hate their job when it's busy.  I'd rather have some crusty old lady at a quaint tacky diner serving me grease at 4am than go to this place where disappointment and sheer mediocrity fills every crevice of this sad little place they call at 24 hour diner."}
{"text":"While dozens of restaurants across town try to achieve a nostalgic vibe via kitschy decor and booth seating, the Lakeview isn't one of them. Not that the Lakeview doesn't have both in spades, it just doesn't have to try. It's always been that way.  The Lakeview is always packed, and it probably has something to do with daily beer specials, killer $3 mimosas and $4 caesars. Post-bar, it's some of the best people-watching in the city.  The $9.50 Poutine Lakeview is a standout -- it mixes sweet potato and hand-cut fries with curds, feta, peameal, garlic-onion crunch, sautéed mushrooms and house gravy. Delish!"}
{"text":"Oh Lakeview. WHAT HAPPENED?  This used to be my favourite spot 10 years ago. I know, things change. But some things stayed the same.   Good: Service remains friendly and prompt. Bad: No more giant omelet menu. Good: No more incessant whine of the milkshake machine. Bad: Terrible wings.   I came here for some post-bar food with some friends. I ordered the wings because I love wings, and how do you screw up wings? Here's how: too much breading, a nearly lethal amount of salt, uneven sauce distribution and letting the dish sit so that the thick breading becomes soggy and cold. I didn't complain or send it back, since everyone else at the table had their meals and I didn't want to make a scene. Also, there was so much wrong with the wings, I didn't know where to start in my comments to the server. When I tried to formulate my complaint, all I could think of was \"they're just... bad.\" And that's not constructive. So I tried to be polite and eat them, but even when I took off the breading, the chicken inside was insanely salty. I ate the fries. Maybe they could have fixed them, but it was 2:30am, the place was packed and I was ready for bed.  My friends enjoyed their meals, particularly the cornflake chicken sandwich. Another friend had a chicken club and thought the breaded chicken inside more bread was a bit much.   I might return if I'm in the area again, but I'll definitely order something else."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place the first few visits.. but as of late the foods been.. let me put it bluntly and say SHITTY!! Yes I might of had a few drinks.. but I still know what good food tastes like. Not impressed with the re-fried sweet potato fries and chintzy portion of steak they try to pass as food.. Tuna melt is also brutal.. do not order!! and the burger went from 'this is awesome' to 'what the hell is this??!!' my rating is based on this place being opened for 24hrs. This place is a crap shoot.. 50/50 you'll get the good stuff. I truly hope the daytime food is much better than the nighttime.. but they've lost me as a fan.. I'd rather go to McDonald's!! at least they have fresh fries.."}
{"text":"How excited was I to be in a \"Diner, Drive-in, Dives\" location...in Canada.  We had the fried chicken sandwich and Freedom toast sandwich. They were both tasty and delicious!  Perfect especially after a night of drink:) The home chips are amazing.  Crispy but lots of good potato taste.  The apple pie was homemade and yieldingly delicious.  We had it au naturel and it was perfect.  I had the pleasure of also having the deep fried mac and cheese.  Marvelous!  If you need your diner foof fix this is definitely the place to be."}
{"text":"This review is for food only. Have tried the cornflake chicken club, mac n cheese balls, and chicken n waffles.  The chicken club is decent - but doesn't come with enough spicy mayo, and they charge extra 50 cents for extra. Mac n cheese balls weren't memorable. Chicken n waffles came with two poached eggs on top, and both of the yolks were cooked through. Also the 'syrup' is the glucose-fructose kind. Side of salad is good, fries are ok, the soft potato chips that come with the waffles are really good."}
{"text":"LOVE IT Just such a classic! So so so well priced (especially compared to these other new diners that are popping up and charge $25 for a burger) So much on the menu, every single item is DELICIOUS!  Brunch here, or 2 am eats - RECOMMEND EVERY TIME!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"B.E.S.T\" sandwich and it was delicious to the last bite.  The chiabatta bun was fresh and soft, the bacon crisp but not burnt and the havarti just melty enough to coat and glue the aforementioned goodness together.  I was surprised with my \"mmmmm\" on first bite.. really wasn't expecting much.  Their club was also impressive.  They fried their chicken different from anything I've seen before and it had an incredible crispy outside while maintaining it's juiciness.  We had to ask for extra mayo cuz the overall was a little dry, but after slathering on some extra, it was smooth sailing.  Their drinks were a little on the weak side, if you're gonna charge me $6 for a cocktail at least lemme taste some of the booze you're advertising. Incredibly small too.  Pretty happy with my first visit here.  Would go back to try more sandwiches.. but not a priority.  Washroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"2 stars for open late feature and good ambiance. The burger was awful! Dont even think about it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch, lunch,  dinner, or late night (open until 5am+!)  Pretty extensive menu (all day brunch, salads, sandwiches, burgers, poutines, platters) and good selection of beverages (caffeinated, iced, alcoholic). They've got it all! Lots of options for sides, substitutions, and add ons as well. Mind though,  this is not a gourmet anything. But everything is good food at a good price, w good service and mood.  I think they may have some relation to Montreal, w choices like Montreal style bagel, smoked meat, a whole list of poutine. You can even upgrade the toast with your brunch to a bagel.  I had the smoked meat sandwich which was decent but fattier than I'm used to. Also it didn't come w a pickle! I may just be particular though having had lived in montreal for 5 years. The fries though were delicious! Freshly made, crunchy as I like it and the perfect amount of salty.  Would be happy to go again. All good that passed me looked appetizing!   May be a wait if you go for brunch or late weekend night but worth it!"}
{"text":"For a diner, it is pricy but the food is of pretty phenomenal quality.  The burger is on point and you can balance it out with a salad.  I love that there $4 seasonal is $3.53 according to the crumpled up receipt I found the next day.  I would definitely eat here sober!"}
{"text":"Years ago, before the current owners of the Lakeview purchased the restaurant, I went for lunch with a friend. It was sad to see what could potentially be a great space, being neglected. I can't remember if this was before or after the fire. I thought no one would turn the place around and it'd end up being demolished or gutted, like so many cool spots in Toronto end up.  Well that's all changed with the current owners. The Lakeview Lunch has a life and energy that was missing when I went with my friend many years ago. It's physically all fixed up, without losing the charm or sacrificing the wonderful wood detail in the bar, booths or fixtures.  The food is incredible and consistently great every time I've been in the past few years. The servers always surprise me with how nice they are considering that some of the clientele can be insufferable, annoying hipsters who talk as loud as humanly possible.  My only complaint would be that if you are in a booth next to a loud group, you won't be able to hear yourself.  Maybe the reno should have included some acoustical panelling.  Their Mac and Cheese is the best I think I've ever had. They have a good brunch. It's a fun place."}
{"text":"This place is not without its charms. It's got the whole old diner look going for it. And the diner food to go along with that look. The service, while friendly, is a bit slow. As if they forgot about you, went and did some errands, and then just recalled you were waiting for some food or the bill or perhaps more water. Still, the fact that this place is ALWAYS open, 24 hours around the clock, more than makes up for the slow pace the staff prefer.  I've been here several times, and sometimes this place is a miss for my dining companions. But honestly, if you've been out partying and are hungry? Great place for greasy, cheesy foods. You're hungover from last night? Not to worry, Lakeview can help you nurse that with eggs.  The menu might not be something that inspires me to go out of my way to visit. But I know Lakeview's got my back, despite my fickle devotion!  P.S: the deep fried Mac n Cheese Balls are the bombdotcom!"}
{"text":"I'm always more than happy to eat at run-down diners because they always have the best food. I even went with a club sandwich, a safe choice and my usual diner fare - but was sorely disappointed. The bread was bland, the crispy chicken almost too hard to eat, and the side caesar was wilted and barely tossed with anything. My spouse had the mac and cheese, which tastes pretty bland too. I'd so been looking forward to eating there. Probably won't be returning, now."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  The turbo is only $5. It's prepared quickly and tastes delicious.   A great \"go to\" place when you fancy a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is another one of those places that I really want to like. Chill atmosphere, daily drink specials, 24-hr food and wifi that works. Not to mention, it is a short jaunt from my house. Alas, every time I go there things go horribly wrong.   I have had several appalling experiences here.... including food that was sent back numerous times for the same reason and being outright ignored by our server. I won't go into details for brevity's sake, but in general this place has mediocre food and poor service. I would be perfectly happy to never return, but for some reason people keep dragging me there.   Lakeview, you could be so great. Smarten up a bit, yeah?"}
{"text":"Just another breakfast joint. Pack with people who look like artsy kind of people and who would ask the government to support their program cause they are starving artist. At the same time can afford to buy themself a 12 bucks basic breakfast.  I am a morning person. I eat breakfast every weekend. Coras, Eggpectation, Frans so on.   To me its just break fast, Two egg, fries, bacon whole wheat toast.   They taste the everywhere.  The only difference a breakfast will make for me if the waiter/waitress is awesome. At this place its alright. Can't complaint cause I don't think they spit on my food :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely OVER RATED! Tried it a number of times, and figured the appealing feature of the restaurant is its 24 hours, convenient parking across the street, and clean."}
{"text":"Was drawn in by the exterior look of this place - old school diner. The menu has a huge variety  from brunch all day to classics like Mac and Cheese, Tuna Melt and many more. The service was personal, friendly and still relaxed in the best way. I loved my entree (the mac and cheese) which came with a tasty and abundant side salad. I only wish I'd had room for one of the desserts, perhaps another time... Great value! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with a 24/7 resto - there's not much around, but love the fact that I know of one for late night munchies.   We just got dessert here after a huge meal at an establishment down the street. All they really had that caught our eyes were the Deep Fried Mars Bars and Reeses Peanut butter cup. Get the Mars Bar instead. However, I found the batter to be a bit thick, and wish there was less of it.   There was a pint special, but hubby says it tasted awful.   Other things on the menu look really yummy but quite basic, but I might be back from some comfort food goodness.  The original decor , but renovated a little is nice, but the booths are kind of uncomfortable - as if people back in the 30s were like half the size of us now and can squeeze into them. You can comfortably fit 2 average sized folks in there, but probably no more. The backs are very straight too. What they need in here is open windows and a big ceiling fan as we were almost dying of poor circulation."}
{"text":"I visited The Lakeview midday with a friend with high hopes. It was not busy inside at all, but the small patio was almost full. We were told we could select a seat, we chose one of the few available spots left on the patio. We ordered mac & cheese (no bacon), eggs benny, and a chocolate milkshake with peanut butter.   The service overall was slow, but our food came out relatively fast. The mac & cheese did have bacon on it, which meant I couldn't eat it, my friend said she was not totally impressed with the dish. The eggs benny was alright, but we both agreed that we would probably go for a sandwich or something else if I went back. Our milkshake did not come out before or with our food, so we inquired about it. The server said she would check on it and came back a while later to tell us they had run out of peanut butter cups and asked if we wanted to swap mars bars or oreo pieces. We were confused because we only wanted peanut butter and not peanut butter cups, so we decided to just get chocolate. The milkshake finally arrived and we both felt that it was only mediocre.   When we were ready to pay, we noticed that we had been charged for the peanut butter cups that we didn't want or recieve, so we went inside and had someone correct it for us because we were tired of waiting.   Overall, not the greatest dining experience for me."}
{"text":"Went expecting a great meal - after waiting 20 minutes on Sat aft, got seated (still looking forwArd to something good), ordered cornflake chicken sandwich and captain canuck peameal sandwich ( still looking forward to a good meal - like on d/d/d tv). Waited... Waited...waited. Almost an hour later, waitress came by and said sorry, forgot to punch in your order - it'll be out in 10 minutes tops...20 minutes later the wrong order came out for one of us. Canuck sandwich had brown dried out cold back bacon (\"o sorry...we'll give you more back bacon...not a replacement but more waiting) then chicken was fried to dark brownness (overdone...). Gave us a whopping 25% discount plus 10$ gift card....big whoop.... All in all a thorough letdown and disappointment. Never again."}
{"text":"The time: 5:00PM on a Tuesday  The problem: Hunger pangs  The solution: Lakeview Restaurant  This charming Dundas West diner serves up a mean chili (for those that like it mild be forewarned that they don't skimp on spice) and their salads aren't half bad either. Prices are exceedingly fair and our server was adequately attentive (it's a diner, I didn't require silver service!)"}
{"text":"I keep trying this place and the servers are great, they do their best but they are always under staffed. Came for the Netflix promo of Riverdale  for my kids but the food is always iffy and we even got to see a mouse this time. Ordered pulled pork comes from a box of boul a bag but two in a row were off.Why?Giving 3 stars because of staff not food."}
{"text":"Quirky retro space with some solid diner favourites. The pouting was solid, Mac and cheese was OK. Chicken and waffles looked tasty. The fillet mignon was tough- I do not think it was a filet. Service was friendly and helpful but very slow."}
{"text":"The service is amazing here, as is the food. Considering the size of the menu, the consistently high food quality is impressive. The daily $4 pint specials should be enough to get you in here. Get in there!"}
{"text":"I visited here a couple weeks ago after hearing really good things about it! I went around 830pm and waited around 15 minutes. Luckily, we got a spot inside to wait, as a ton of people showed up shortly after we did. We got sat at a table for two and our waitress quickly brought a pitcher of water and asked us if we had any questions. After looking at the menu, I decided on the cornflake club sandwich, and my friend got the fried pickles and poutine. We were both very pleased with our choices and I would absolutely get the chicken again! The fried pickles are up there with some of the best I've tasted!  This is a good late-night spot, or just anytime! I really want to come back to try breakfast. Plus, the prices are super reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Love the old feel of the diner  which is a draw for me and the food is always good.  My one issue is that with the standard breakfast of bacon and eggs is that you only get two strips of bacon--so make sure you order more on the side if you are a bacon fan.  Service has been quite good and friendly--I have been there a couple of times--once in the evening and once in the morning.  If you are going with kids do an early dinner the hip crowd gets in later with the great drink prices.....get there before 11 a.m. if you don't want a line up for breakfast."}
{"text":"The place itself is really cute, old and comforting. The food was pretty good. The shepherd's pie was awesome with a slight tang, the disco fries were so good too! We got the club sandwich because the server informed us that Guy Fieri ordered it on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\". The club was decent, not bad at all and the side salad was so good! The only dish we ordered that we weren't impressed with was the Mac n Cheese. It was cheesey for sure but not very flavourful at all.   Overall a decent place to hang out and grab a meal with friends.   *The bathrooms need work! The female washroom was pretty gross."}
{"text":"I went to the Lakeview for Brunch yesterday and it is a true gem!  The food was excellent!   And to top it all off they also have $3 Mimosas!!  I ordered the Freedom Toast and it was amazing!  French Toast stuffed with Peameal Bacon, Brie & Havarti cheese - I highly recommend!    I was told they usually have a long wait but we were seated within about 15 mins.  They were super busy and they still provided decent service."}
{"text":"Hip semi-updated diner in a getting-to-be hip neighborhood.  I got a shake and grilled cheese and both were pretty tasty, but probably double in price what they would have been had this been a regular diner.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is pretty cool, the food was pretty good, and it's nice to have variety like this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service experiences of my life. Late Saturday night wee hours of Sunday morn and it's -10oC or so we wait in line for about 10 minutes as the Lakeview is busy. Finally get in and wait again for a table. We sit and order a smoked meat sandwich, apple pie and mac balls. Food takes at least 45 minutes. Sandwich was cold and fries were tiny portioned. On our way out my touque was stolen as I can't find it in. Top it off I get home and puke out the sandwich. Emailed the restaurant no response. Called them and nothing on the lost and found. Overall terrible customer service and never going back again."}
{"text":"It looks so nice from outside....  Services are very slow! I came for an emergency thirst beer and it took the sraff ten minutes to bring it.  Food was ok, but more like a bar food... so definitely not the catch for me.  The positive might be the good beer selection, however my joy from that was destroyed by the bad smell (10pm) which would be comparable to a smell of a dirty bar at 3am."}
{"text":"Great food, great value.  This is an old Toronto gem. I appreciate an old school diner like this with plenty of antiques and memorabilia. The service was very good. I had the cheese steak sandwich with fries and greens - would recommend. I tried my friends order, cornflake chicken, which was also good. Loved the $4 drink specials!   The washroom is a bit run down."}
{"text":"Two aspects to consider about this place.  1)  Its a diner that is confused.  Too many menu items, it really needs to stop serving the items that the restaurant knows it doesn't do very well ... OR doesn't sell much of.  By simplifying the menu, food would come out faster, and people (at whatever hour / how many beers they've already had) can be served quickly.  Also the decor is old but the menu is a mishmash of different items (see the above point.)  2)  Its a 24hr restaurant... so depending at what time you come to this place, you'll either think its great, or you'll think that you've had better.  In addition the place is often busy... and gets eaters in waves.  So sometimes its hard to get a seat.  I'll say this much, the staff tries to be friendly.  They try to serve quickly.  The food is simple.  A pint of beer is cheap.   Some food items are a hit or a miss.  But you'll likely will always have the option of going here because it never closes.  3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"pulled pork sandwich/the tuna melt!  so good."}
{"text":"Had my first ever peameal bacon sandwich here. What a life changing moment."}
{"text":"The Lakeview has been slipping a bit lately.  When they just reopened under new management with their new menu, everything was stellar!  The last few times we've been tho, they haven't been living up to the standards that they set for themselves.  Mushy homefries, mis-cooked eggs (asked for poached hard, got runny snot).  Today's banana-bread french toast sounds amazing, but was dry, and generally unappealing.  FWIW, banana bread is too dense to make good french toast.  Hopefully they can pull up their socks and get back to the 5-star standard they were once at."}
{"text":"It's been at least a year or more since I have been to The Lakeview for a late meal, so that's where I headed last night. The place seemed a little more worn than I remember, a few bar stools may soon need replacing, and it was rather loud but that's normal from my experience. It was clean, and the service was quite fast for both food and drinks. As a cyclist, I also liked that I happened to sit under a bicycling picture.  I had two $4 Caesars and a bowl of Maple Leaf Poutine. The poutine was very good; it had sausage and both peameal and strip bacon. The $4 Caesars are one of their many daily drink specials, which also include a variety of wines and local beers. Overall everything was good, nothing special, but as good as most other places that are open 24hrs.  Total price was $20, not bad with the drink specials, but entrees and sandwiches seem to be a bit more expensive that comparable places. They also serve water in a glass bottle for you to pour yourself, so perhaps they think they are more upscale than I do."}
{"text":"The Lakeview sits proudly at the corner of Dundas & Ossington, and as such when visiting you may feel like you're experiencing a Back to the Future moment when everyone looks like they are from the 80's in their hipster attire.  I will commend this place for its selection of craft breweries on tap. I had a Great Lakes Orange Peel Ale first which was quite tasty, followed by a Big Rock Traditional Ale. Both tasty and only $4 as they were the daily special.  Things took a turn for the worst with the food though. Pulled pork so dry I needed to put ketchup on my sandwich to finish it! Thats right, ketchup on a pulled pork sandwich! This is something that should never need to be done. The fries would have been good if they weren't served cold. The mixed greens were good though, no complaints there.   Everyone else seemed to enjoy what they had otherwise, but the complete mediocrity of my meal definitely will prevent me from wanting to go back even despite the cheap pints."}
{"text":"You know what's awesome? When a bartender dissuades you from ordering a drink on the menu because \"it's really awful.\" I dig that kind of honesty. Granted, I should have known that the \"Et tu, Caesar\" at the Lakeview was going to be bad, considering its description: \"A Traditional Caesar knocked up with Onion Soup Mix, topped with celery & chive sour cream.\" However, it was one of those things that sounded *so* disgusting it might be right. But the bartender came up to my table after the server had taken my order and said, \"Don't. Order. That. Everyone who's ever ordered it has sent it back. The sour cream curdles at the top.\" AAAUUGGH. Thank you, mister bartender, from saving me from a horrid mistake!   The only shortcoming of this place is that it doesn't really suit groups larger than 6. Our party of 9 had to squeeze into two side-by-side booths, which made it a little  hard to mingle.   Anyway. My husband and I split the Lakeview Poutine, which was non-traditional but still very tasty (a mix of sweet potato and regular fries, frizzled onions, bacon, sauteed mushrooms). And when I needed something cool to quench my thirst, they were quite able to oblige my request of boozing up a chocolate milkshake with Bailey's and Kahlua. (If you go back, I recommend you do the same. Deeeeeelicious!)  Great service, boozy milkshakes by request, good drink specials, bartenders who don't want to see you drink curdled sour cream, and a fun atmosphere! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Service great, whole staff very friendly, willing to genuinely engage customers in conversations.   Breakfast meals I've had here have been delicious.    Only minor request would be to find a way to keep brewed coffee hotter for longer.  (And, time to spend some dough on rehabbing booths a little - and update the bathrooms!)"}
{"text":"i have come here for easter on this day. immediately i, notice on the bar there is salt, peeper, sugar, i am drawn to this. there 4$ dollar bear on this day has been called blank de champy it taste like perfume ... there is 2 french fries in my sweet potato. 1 of the servants speak german to a guy ,it feel controversial, especially on waster, like a rap song by m&m. the sweet potato has a little bowl for sticking into and i will say under the table and discreet that it is well worth your time to stick in the finger in the orange cream. i anticipate return for more cream"}
{"text":"My most recent visit to the Lakeview must have been an off day for the kitchen.  Popped in with the gf and her parents (the latter eat exclusively at big chain type restaurants, Red Lobsters, and the like)...  Gf had steak and mash, which was solid -- steak cooked medium rare as requested, tender, and good.  Dad had wings and fries, which he enjoyed.  Here's where things derailed a bit:  Mom had pancakes, two of which were burnt on the bottom.  Still, she said they were tasty and was pleased with her meal (I suppose if you're used to eating Golden Griddle pancakes, even burnt real ones are an imporvement).  Finally, I had mac 'n' cheese w/ poutine.  I ordered the poutine extra to share, but the server misunderstood and \"upgraded\" my side.  No biggee, but I REALLY needed the side salad.  Anyway.  Poutine was barely lukewarm, with undercooked (and stale) fries and cheese curds that were more like crumbled white chedder.  Definitely not authentic curds, despite what the menu promised.  Mac 'n' cheese was almost identical to Kraft white cheddar mac with the slightest dusting of bread crumbs on top.  Very, very disappointed in this.  Very bland, overcooked, and just plain wrong.  So bad, in fact, that I covered it in pepper and ketchup and just pretended I was 8 again.  I then ignored the price and enjoyed some nostalgia.  And, for the record, the $4 Cobblestone Stout almost made up for everything.  Can't beat that price for a pint!  Anyway, past visits to the Lakeview have been good, so I'll settle on a 3 star rating and just avoid these menu items in the future."}
{"text":"I love the Lakeview. They have amazing classics and everything you expect and want in a diner/breakfast experience. They do not have a view of a lake at all, but they do have all the diner sexiness plus all the diner hustle and bustle. It is busy. BUSY, with fun, diner like noise. Chatter, some clanging around, laughter, it is nice.  Lakeview works/operates like a well oiled machine, they seat you quickly and turn tables quickly.  Lakeview has a sexy as F dynamo kind of... Bartender? guy who invites you to join him at the bar to eat when there are no tables available, if you can, rock the bar it is a fun experience, especially if you are eating solo. You can also get a table from the lovely hostess, who if it is busy will take your name. I have never waited more than 5 actual minutes.   Food is great, I am currently eating a special medical diet. I asked for some substitutions, though I know it is not preferred in a diner setting, they were super accommodating and acted as if it was no problem at all. My Food was A+ Bronson, My dining companion had a HUGE burger!  He said it was the stuff burger dreams are made of.   I recommend Lakeview big time, 5*s.  5 STARS!  Update: cold gravy 2X in a row. YUK! Now 4 stars..."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great and really love the old charm of this lovingly restored diner. A staple toronto late night munch or brunch. Hearty, filling portions with something for everyone weather you;re in the mood to be a fatty or want to be health conscious."}
{"text":"Lakeview is oookkk but you'll wait here all day if you go on the weekend and there are so many better brunch spots to be waiting around in! I got their rookie blue smoothie which was pretty meh, and they used to have feta on their grilled cheese which they took off a while back. The waitress always told people to not get it with the feta (even though the feta was amazing) and now it no longer includes feta. I feel like she just had a personal vendetta against feta."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed my experience. New favourite deep fried pickle place. Really looking forward to trying the apple pie milkshake :) definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They lie, they are NOT 24hrs, don't go there!!   I live in Woodbridge and I came all the way here and the door was closed, I waved to the staff at the bar, he came to the door and told me they're closed because the manager decided to close early.   They should update their hours listed here on yelp because it's NOT right!!!  I'm giving them a 1 Star because they are liars."}
{"text":"It was really late like 4am we were on a bar near by and hungry we came here and ordered burgers, my Burger wasn't really good, I ordered the one with 3 different cheese (can't remember the name) and my man ordered one with a fried egg on it (his was really good) we sat beside the kitchen, big big mistake.   We could hear loud, really really loud hard core metal music, I have nothing against their music preference, however it's 4am we were kinda drunk/hangover and definitely tired, we both had a headache after. Our server was really present, we are probably not coming back"}
{"text":"Lakeview Lunch has been around for a long, long time, but were closed for the past few weeks (months?) due to renovations.  Well, those renovations are officially complete and they are once again open for business.  I'm giving Lakeview a 4-star rating mostly based on its environment.  It's great to have a 24-hour diner with an friendly staff in this neighbourhood.  Also, I enjoyed the food here, for the most part.  Bacon and Eggs are a staple dish that require a certain level of quality for any diner to earn its chops, and in my opinion, LL passes.  The coffee was pretty awful, but that means I'll be having an americano next time.  The washroom only had room for 1-2 people, and in a restaurant that looked like it could hold 90-100 people, that's not really cool.  Just something to be aware of for when you try out the new Lakeview Lunch."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is a'right with me. It used to suck, so I was glad when it got taken over by new management. It's nice to have a late night place in the neighborhood serving food. They also have a $4 beer special on tap every night (last night was Amsterdam Blonde and Steam Whistle). Food's pretty good, and so's the service.  Wish the fries were better and less burnt tasting, but overall, I like the Lakeview, especially after midnight."}
{"text":"3 stars during regular hours, 4 stars in comparison to other places after hours. Essentially, if it's 4am, and you're thinking 24hr McDonalds or Lakeview, I'd go with Lakeview.  I had their burger and with portobello mushroom and bacon so that was a pretty big winner right there. And despite being open 24hrs the prices were pretty reasonable and the food was prepared fresh, as far as diner food goes. I've seen some other 24hr places in the city use chips instead of fries or store bought pitas as \"flatbread\" pizzas to minimize kitchen staff so overall I'd say Lakeview is a good late night option."}
{"text":"Arrived @130pm for Brunch Sunday. After waiting about 15 minutes for a table, we were seated. We waited another 10 minutes for our drink order, 2 Caesars.... we also ordered our mains 1) benny Atlantic 2) massive breakfast.... 10 minutes passes and our drinks finally arrive. Service was very slow, the Caesars were great at $4 but very slow at replenishment. The food was okay. The eggs on the benny were hard poached.... and the English muffin not toasted. The eggs on the massive were suppose to be over medium, but came out poached medium. It came with 2 cute small pancakes ... no butter or syrup so they were a little dry and tasteless.  Not sure why this place was so busy.  Got our bill .... you guessed it .... waited another 10 minutes for machine ... Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I recommend the deep fried mac and cheese balls! The fungi salad topped with cornflake chicken was also very tasty. The cornflake chicken sandwich was a bit on the dry side which was disappointing because it seems to be a popular choice. Won't stop me from coming back though :)"}
{"text":"What a fool I am!  Here I stood before my favourite pizza joint on the kitschy Ossington only to discover that it would not open for another 30 minutes.      Alas, all was not lost for right around the corner from this unnamed pizza mecca, was the legendary Lakeview diner which boasts that it's \"always open\".  I strode in and took the first stool that I saw at the counter and perused the warm environment.  Welcoming, friendly, unassuming and lighthearted is how I would describe the decor.  But who on earth cares about diner decor?!?        The menu brings all of the standard diner fair along with some fun twists.  Although there were several breakfast and lunch items that I was curious about, I was sucked into buttermilk pancakes, with whipped cream, berry compote and maple syrup.  Why would I get something so mundane when I could probably muddle together the same items at home?!?  For the same reason that Godzilla decided to stomp Tokyo as opposed to New York... because the belly wants what the belly wants.       The pancakes were done well, the compote was incredible and the whipped cream and syrup did not disappoint.  The only request that I have is that they would look at a better quality of bacon as what was served, did the trick but wasn't anything to yelp about.     On a positive side, I don't live in the area.  For if I did, I would be a regular getting increasingly larger as I munched my way through their creative menu.  You can't go wrong here folks!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came in here with a friend late on a Saturday night. I love that it's open 24/7!   Our waiter was great, though I noticed some others doing things that I would not be cool with if they were serving me. (ie: nearly dropping food but catching it between their hands and bodies then repositioning it back on the plate before taking it to the table... eeek!)  The menu is solid, good variety. A bit overpriced in my opinion.  Good space, tunes, and whatnot.  The later it got though, the louder and more crowded it became filling up with drunkards clearing out from the neighbourhood bars. It was a great little place to meet and yap until then when it became so loud that I couldnt hear myself talk, let alone my friend sitting across the table. :) So we left.  Overall good place and I'm sure I will be back when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My fav diner in Toronto Roland is the best server ever! Cracks me up every time I come in. Fast service and good food for great prices and who can go wrong with 3 dollar mimosas!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a crazy hot afternoon & sat out on their sidewalk/patio. Staff was lovely and friendly. I had the chicken & waffles eggs benedict - it was GOOD. Covered in a sausage (tasting) gravy, I ordered some extra maple syrup (I love my sauces) and have been thinking of this meal ever since! I don't even know what my husband ordered, I was so enamored with my meal. Would absolutely try this place again, the menu is extensive, it was hard to choose!"}
{"text":"I came here because it was one the show diners, drive ins and dives on the food network. I wanted to give it a shot since I was visiting Toronto. It seemed like a local spot and it was open 24/7 which was cool. Only street parking and they accept credit cards. Our waiter was so nice he was a tall man with glasses i wish i got his name. He told us a little about Canada which was nice. So sweet! The food was a very good. I ordered the lakefront triple decker and the poutine! Both very good. I highly recommend their local beer as well. Only downside to this place was the bathroom. It was dirty and small. Needs to be cleaned and renovated. Other than that, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a fancy place, if it wasn't for the amazing service and good food I would've never came back (repeatedly). The food is standard diner food, and the service is great they are always so friendly and quick to help. At times it can seem slightly expensive  given the aesthetics of the diner and that the food is pretty typical BUT to me it's worth it for the awesome service and being open 24 hours."}
{"text":"It's about time I stop fantasizing about eating at this west-end institution ever since coming across it one night, and actually eat here for once. And so I did for lunch one sunny Saturday.  This classic diner retains much of that vintage 1940s charm, but is busy as hell. Classic diner fare and 24-hour breakfast coupled with new twists on diner food--and even oddities like deep fried Mars bars--keeps the area's hipsters and old-timers coming here.  The 'Lakeview Poutine' ($9.50) opened my eyes to the idea of using sweet potato fries in a poutine, but I wish they'd add more of it. It was a very big and filling dish, but not spectacular, especially with the overwhelming amount of thick starchy gravy, and the bacon bits that don't add much of anything. The deep-frield mac and cheese on the other hand, was yummy.  I'd imagine it'd be a great late-night west-end stomach-stuffing joint, much like Fran's in the downtown core. It won't hurt your wallet much either, not especially when they advertise $4 caesars.  {TTC: the 505 or 63 to Dundas/Ossington. If you can't find it on the northeast corner, what the hell is wrong with you?}"}
{"text":"The Lakeview is a place that can be depended upon to be always open, always beautiful, and always accomodating to boozed bellies (that is, in a state of over-zealousness around 3am or a state of withdrawl and regret around 1pm).  The patio out front seats about 20 people, and is always bathed in sunshine.  If it's too hot for you out there, head for a booth inside where the decor is like a handsome man who smells of cigars--beautiful, subtle, warm and classic.   I'm a big fan of brunch here.  $3 mimosas and $4 pint specials keeps your hair of the dog affordable, and most Sundays they do a special benny with havarti and Montreal smoked meat that is just freaking mouthwatering.  Service is friendly and capable. They actually listen to you when you request your eggs over- or poached-HARD. This is a godsend for yolk skeptics like myself. The icing on the cake--or rather, the sauce on your breakfast potatos-- is the Sweet Chili Mayo, which is always 'gratis.'  Munch dat brunch; you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I really, really, hate this place.  I can't stand a restaurant that has no integrity, whatsoever. I know this is a diner, so I also know that using the words \"integrity\" and \"restaurants\" maybe shouldn't apply here, and I might be inclined to agree if it wasn't for the high prices, shitty \"I don't care cause whatever man this is Ossington and it's cool not to\" service, and the pretentious restaurant jargon that's tossed all over the fucking menu; if you're gonna put canned mushrooms on your crappy 16 dollar burger, then call them canned mushrooms, not \"sauteed wild mushrooms\". I've been cooking for, and especially eating for long enough to know the difference, and that you're an asshole for using canned mushrooms.  It probably doesn't help that I live upstairs and have to listen to drunken retards running amok at all hours, but for the amount of money I've wasted in the vain hope that it will get better, I think I am pretty well within my rights to say fuck this place. If it wasn't where it is, nobody would bother."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch..oh where to go?  Check out the Lakeview (no view of the lake!).  It has the old school feel of the booths and a diner type feel.  The servers are pretty friendly and on Sundays they have drink specials - $3 mimosas!  I ordered the Turbo - friend egg with cheese, english muffins, salad, potatoes, and smoked salmon and capers.  I asked for it deconstructed since I really didn't want it in a sandwich form and they obliged!  So I ate it separately (yes I know that is weird, but watching too much Top Chef makes me feel I can do this).  The fried egg was ok, needs a little seasoning.  The potatoes were sliced thin and were so hard that some were inedible actually.  It was a shame actually because I was soo looking forward to the potatoes and smoked salmon the most.  The salad was nice since they put some blackberries on it so it gave a different flavour to what could have been a boring salad.  We waited for about 15 min for a table and then I think about 25 min for our food to arrive.  Which I think is a bit ridiculous since we all ordered simple dishes - how long does it take to cook an egg with no seasoning?  Overall if I lived closer I would come back and try a few different things on the menu - the disco fries looked interesting (fries with melted havarti cheese???  I am in!)"}
{"text":"Known for their apple pie milkshake.   They're huuuuuge. If youre going with a group of 2 or 3, just order one milkshake. If you dine in they will give you the cup they prepared it in.  It's a lot.  Their mimosas are $3. There are also man-mosas, and pitchers. The waiter didn't  accept my NY state ID  and had to go check upfront which was annoying.  The mimosa itself  is really good. Honestly, I wish I  got a pitcher because  I got more than one.  Bathrooms are tiny."}
{"text":"great hours!  food is decent but too expensive!  I guess you pay for the 'area/location/hours'.  Also a nice setting.  The club house i had last time; so average and way over priced."}
{"text":"The lakeview diner is a harsh mistress.   She's the kind of girl that orders the most expense pasta on a first date, the kind of girl that doesn't kiss you on the lips after sex, and the kind of girl that leaves you on the toilet for hours after a late night encounter.   Oh. That. Burn.   Went in last night around 1am to get my late night snack on with the wife, it was Wednesday, no line, half the sections blocked off, just how we like it.   Our server was a little bit of a robot -  If skynet launched tomorrow, he'd be leading the charge. That being said he was efficient and speedy - his mother was probably a blender.   We both ordered burgers - the standard (veggie style), and the majestic... Which is just the standard with bacon / cheese... +$4 price tag.   The food took awhile considering there weren't very many people in the restaurant - during our wait no food was coming out of the kitchen and no one was really coming into the diner... It was a little perplexing.  We got the food - as usually I always eat the salad / fries first... I don't know why I did this... But after a few pints it seemed like a good idea at the time.   The robot puttered over to do his quality check, haven't even taken a bite out of my burger yet... But we said things were fine.   Here's where she strikes, t ook a few bites into the burger and I noticed it was a little pink - which for me isn't the end of the world... But as I continued to eat, I noticed the more burger I bit into the more it moo'd.   The whole burger was severely undercooked ... I'm talking 50 shades of pink here.   First impression - I don't understand how you can undercook a burger that took 30 minutes to make - when it wasn't busy - at 1am - on a Wednesday night. If anything it should be burnt, right ?   Second impression - I'm an animal !  One of the other servers walked by and asked if I was done with the plate that I pushed off to the side - I said \"yeah I'm definitely done, the whole burger is pink.\" He then took the plate without a word, and went into the kitchen with robot to address the issue.   After that, nothing really happened... No apology, no one asked if I wanted something else, no one said anything to me. As if, they knew what happened was shitty.... And they chose sweep it under the rug.  \"Are you done ?\" was all I got.   Robot came back with the bill face down, \"here's... the... bill...beep beep zip zop\"   (I added the beep beep zip zop for tone), but the rest was spot on.   On my receipt, under my meal there was a \"911\" and \"$-3.00\"... Who the hell does that ?! Is that how we solve issues in the hospitality business ?!   If this incident was listed as 911, then why wasn't it treated as such ? Why didn't the establishment do anything/everything to serve and protect my hunger ?   3 dollars off a bill ?! Like come on, It wasn't even a percentage... It was exactly 3 dollars flat. Do you mean to tell me that someone came up with the equation that if we serve raw meat to someone that we knock off 3 bucks... What grand wizard conjured up that wicked customer service spell ?!   \"Here's the plan patron: YOU pay $14 dollars for a meal, well take 30 minute to 'cook' it, take a few bites, you'll discover that it has a pulse, we'll silently take the plate away and charge you $11?\"  AND BREAK !   Some may say that I just wanted to get my meal comped ... Yeah, who doesn't ? But, the long and the short of it is that they handled the situation terribly and didn't provide any options after blatantly and DANGEROUSLY messing up my meal. I should have been given an apology, offered a replacement meal,  given a discount, it taken off my bill, a milkshake on the house, anything that would remotely reflect some sincerity.   \"Are you done ?\"   Ha.  Yes I am done - with the Lakeview diner."}
{"text":"We waited 90 minutes to get our food and when it came it tasted like old grease. The servers are sweet but overall the experience was awful and the food was bad."}
{"text":"The Lakeview took a long time to reopen, and upon reopening they did not seem to be ready at all. However, since my first visit I have become a fan of the lakeview, and deem it a worthy choice for a casual breakfast, lunch, or after pub food option.  The menu is relatively simple - salads, sandwiches, burgers, all day breakfast, and they deliver them consistently good. Nothing here is special, but its a good, decent diner menu.  The interior has the potential to be great, but is only ok. I love that they have kept the old booths, however, the walls are just too bland, and creates a stale environment at times. I realise they are going for that queen west, dundas west simplicity, but when surrounded by white, it feels a tad tedious, and some nice classic pictures, or movie posters would do no harm.  Overall, I recommend the lakeview for a casual breakfast or lunch. Its old-school, simple, and consistent, with solid service to top it off."}
{"text":"We are from the states and saw this diner on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.\" We have talked about going here for a while, so since we were up here on a long weekend, we decided to go for breakfast (around 8:30a).   When we entered, the waitress asked us to seat ourselves at any table that was set. We were the only customers in the restaurant at the time and only a small section was open. This wouldn't have been a problem if they weren't working on lights above the tables. There were a few tiny booths set that had drywall or plaster ALL over the settings. We told the waitress and she didn't believe us. She wanted us to sit there. She finally looked and moved us to the back of the nearly pitch black restaurant. We were then served room temperature tap water (the kind you get out of the sink immediately without letting the faucet run to cool it down). She then let us know that the breakfast menu wasn't ready until 9a (what!?). Then I decided since I was on vacation, I wanted a mimosa.  A pretentious waiter with greased back hair came over to take our order. Asking for a mimosa turned out to be a fatal error. He scoffed and said \"Ontario liquor laws... Am I right?\" It took a lot of strength not to punch him in the face, but I did make it clear I had no idea. Then I ordered my pancakes that I would have to wait for since the breakfast menu was not being served yet.   As pretentious greasy haired waiter was typing in our order, the waitress was giving us the evil eye. We decided to get up and leave. In retrospect, we should have waited ten more minutes to really screw them over."}
{"text":"On a hot, muggy Friday evening, my friend and I met up for dinner at the Lakeview...no view of the lake. We sat in the patio, ordered beer - the beer listing is outdated as the Muskoka one I wanted to try is no longer available and eventually ordered dinner: the Standard and the Chelsea burgers.  The service was friendly, efficient and non-intrusive. The patio is tiny!  Surprisingly enough, it is not possible to overhear people's conversations. We had a great time catching up. Nice place to try out."}
{"text":"Pros:  Atmosphere  Location is nice Food served on time Comfortable seating Price is reasonable  Delicious food! The menu selection Chicken club Chocolate mint Milkshake!!! Open 24/hrs  Fast seating  Great for groups  Cons:  Staff service is mixed (either great or horrible) Noise level can be crazy  Cleanliness I guess since our waiter made a big deal about it LOL (see personal note below) Music played too many hit songs of the same artist (specifically they played only Michael Jackson- I've just had enough after 5 hits)   Summary: Better than Fran's for a date-worthy spot that you won't be embarrassed about taking your date.  The personal note below this paragraph set the mood for us ordering our food and thus a three star rating instead of 4/5. Long story short, the food was great! I took a photo of the food  and was satisfied like Buddha after eating. I had the club sandwich with fries and a side of gravy. I think my boyfriend had the cornflake chicken sandwich... ask for extra condiments on the side as the food is a bit bland without it.  Waiters are either great or bad.  Took forever to pay our bill, we had to beg to pay and scrambled to pay with cash to save waiting for the interact machine ...   P.S. Yes eat here but note that you may leave inheriting the undue stress that the waiters put on themselves ... seriously it's OK if the table is dirty and the customer basically demands you don't wipe their table (with probably a really dirty cloth in the first place)....  ^^final conclusion   PERSONAL note--- I usually have a great time however went yesterday & the waiter was very intense; he mentioned our table wasn't cleaned properly & we said don't worry about it. We honestly just came from a long bike ride  and could care less, especially since the table was clean to me. He said, \"well at least let me get that coffee stain for you.\" I said don't worry about it, but before I could assure him,  he went off and got a cloth. I said don't worry about it again as the table will just be wet. He said he needed to and wiped our table after we politely offered/said AND told him not to. We just wanted to order our food... THEN the hilarious and sad part; he ran off, grabbed about 2 dozen napkins ..... then wiped the small spot of water off our table.   Advice to that waiter: Chillllll it's okay. We love you if you bring us food. We were dressed for biking and are flattered you wanted to clean the table that was cleaner than us after biking around all day. Also it felt horrible that you forced us into the OCD ritual when we just wanted to relax. Maybe you were new? I hope so. Cause your service was really anxious even though when I politely asked you said it was a slow day......"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for brunch but my friends and I decided to come here for dinner after having a few pints of beer down the street.   This place does have a patio but it is quite small, so if sitting out in patios is your thing, then you are good to go. Now onto the decor, inside was like your average diner with the diner-like counter tops and cute little table booths just like the ol' days. Very retro, I would say. The place was kind of dim lit and discoloured but it wasn't that much of a distraction.   The menu was quite extensive with so many different options to choose from! We've got sandwiches, burgers, entree plates, brunch, dessert, drinks and the list goes on! It was really tough for me to choose something that I really wanted because everything on the menu sounded pretty good. I wanted a burger and the fish and chips and I didn't want to get both but guess what, I found the solution to my problem. The \"Boondock Fishwich\" was the perfect blend of the two! A fried filet of fish sandwich with tartar sauce! It sounded great to me so I went for it. My friends all got burgers and one of them went for the Shepherd's Pie.  The daily drink specials looked great and very tempting but I was not ready for round 2 of drinks, haha!  I was super hungry and the food took forever to come. I was getting weary from all of the waiting but nevertheless, the food ends up showing up after the long wait.  My sandwich looked incredibly appetizing and the sides looked great. Plating of the fries and the field greens looked kind of messy but hey, I can't complain, food's food, time to dig in!  Fries were great but it tasted just like any other fries and the field greens was something that could be bought at a super market. Now onto the fishwich, it was a great sandwich but it was definitely lacking something. The fish was cooked perfectly but it was so bland that it didn't even taste like anything. It was a shame but I still downed it down like a monster because I was so hungry!   My friend's shepherd's pie wasn't all that bad either. Flavourful and definitely wasn't as bland as my fishwich, makes me wish I had ordered that instead.  Overall, the food was ok, a bit bland but the service here was great! I'll definitely be back to try their breakfast items because the regular stuff seemed alright, nothing great but I've heard that this place is great when it comes to breakfast and I will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"The Lakeview has it going on!!!  As my YELP profile says, I'm a filmmaker and I get my work done at night - nothing pleases me more than an all night diner where I can lay out my MacBook and get some good writing done, while playing off the local energy  The Lakeview is an awesome diner for any writer! The tea and coffee are good and the food is solid  The diner has a very, 1950's, Americana-train-car feel, but it is also uniquely Canadian, with Bollywood posters everywhere and a diverse crowd dining  If you want to find Toronto's true soul, come here at 3 AM and enjoy  I will definitely be back  Love and peace all!"}
{"text":"I went to the Lakeview for a late night bite to eat and was only pleased by their Poutine, which had a nice gravy. I also had a \"benny\" aka eggs Benedict that originally came out with eggs that were poached too hard. The benny had crab cakes that were fried and barely tasted like authentic crab. The benny lacked any intriguing flavors and I recall leaving most of it on my plate. If it wasn't for the nice hollandaise sauce I doubt I would have bothered to try to eat as much as I did.   We sat on the additional seating section that was not where the bar was. Warning this section was hot as apparently air conditioning did not reach that area, or so it felt."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Lakeview. It's definitely a great spot to hit once last call has come and gone, but this usually means the place is packed of hipsters and the service decreases in speed considerably. Even when I've been here during slow hours the waiters are usually standing around and talking to each other rather than bringing me my cheque or asking me if I want another pint or more coffee. Regardless the food is pretty good, especially for a 24-hour restaurant. I keep going back so they must be doing something right!  But they have managed to mess up my order more than once. Sometimes when I get takeout and don't realise I'm missing something until I get home to my apartment at 5:00am. Have to mention how hit-and-miss the service can be... Some nights it's absolutely brutal."}
{"text":"This place always seems like a good idea. I went last night with two girlfriends. Service is always great. And the food for the most part was tasty. I ordered a bowl of soup and the deep fried mac and cheese balls. The balls were great! But the restaurant was cold, the soup was cold and the coffee was cold. My friend ordered breakfast with eggs over medium (too runny) my other friend had the cheesecake which we all admit was tasty. Also,  a woman threw up in the booth behind us, which the restaurant can't be blamed for but was gross none the less.   Really, this would be a four star reviews if they just turned the heat up on everything."}
{"text":"We stood at the front for about 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. One girl literally walked to a table near the door to check on those customers without acknowledging our presence. We were the only ones waiting on a Saturday afternoon for brunch.   The food was mediocre. Crab cake benny was far too dry and chicken waffle benny was way too heavy. $3.25 mimosa was nice but not worth the poor service and lower than average food quality. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Had the Brisket sandwich and the Shake with Apple pie.  Everything was Delicious,  cooked well and decent price.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  I'm a big guy with a big belly and had trouble sitting in the booths but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Are you FUCKING kidding me. Do not eat here. Disgusting. Ordered 3 sandwiches. It cost 40$. My sandwich the \" triple decker cornflake chicken\" was burnt, freezing cold and on  soggy cheap grocery store bread, not a bun as you would expect from a restaurant. My husband's sandwiches were undercooked pemeal also on cheap dollar bread. Made completely wrong. Thank god Uber was able to refund us."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to go back to this place after my initial and second visit. First time I went I had a burger and it was delicious. I don't remember what kind it was, but I do remember great toppings and fries that were  gone in about 4 minutes.   Second time there I was accidentally given the mushroom burger instead of the mushroom Swiss, but surprise surprise, it was also delicious! I actually had no idea and had eaten through half of it already.  Every time I go by this place there's line ups. Way too popular, but that speaks well for it. I'll be heading back when it's not so busy.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced for what you get.   $10 for 3 tiny pancakes that my husband consumed in about 7 bites and it did not come with the advertised \"mixed berry coulis\" that was mentioned on the menu. The \"fresh fruit\" that accompanied said pancakes consisted of a tiny strawberry cut in half and what looked like a clementine wedge. The chicken in my club sandwich was literally one centimetre thick, not exaggerating. It was all bread and a couple tomato slices. The other two dishes that our table ordered were nothing to write home about taste-wise, and also too expensive for what was received.   Breakfast/brunch for 4 came up to $75, before tip. Highway robbery for such small portions of mediocre food.   It's unfortunate because this used to be a solid spot back in the day, and could have been a regular place for our small family to hit up for breakfast (especially during the winter)...but unfortunately, we don't take too kindly to being ripped off.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here last night to celebrate a friend's return from Korea. All she wanted was poutine and that that's what we got. The poutine here is almost on par with the classic Montréal dish (not a lot of places in TO can make it like that). Good job guys and thanks a million for the sweet 4$ daily pint special."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in Toronto. Been there forever, open 24/7, broad menu. Most of my experiences have been stellar with free samples, laid back wait staff and decent quality of food. I usually love their poutine but was disappointed with the dish on Saturday (the last time we were there).  The atmosphere of a 50's diner is still the focus of the experience.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I think I need to come back. I came here late afternoon for a bite and cheap $3 mimosas with my best friend.  The mimosas were weak in the alcoholic sense, either that or I've built up my champagne tolerance. We split pancakes which were the most interestingly fluffy yet crispy things... I'm not sure if I hated or loved them. Our server was hot/cold and kind of hard to track down. I imagine it'd be a cool place to go at the end of   late night when it's more packed. My experience was average."}
{"text":"Service:  Diner.  Interior:  Dirty diner.  Food:  Let's say, \"ambitious diner.\"  Prices:  See Food.    The orange juice was terrible, but my \"Turbo\" sandwich was fantastic.  It's a fried egg on English muffin, with cheddar, garlic aioli, and your choice of sauteed wild mushrooms, strip bacon, or peameal.  I got mine with the mushrooms, and could not have been happier with the sandwich.  That's good because the potatoes were average, the green salad was average, and the strip bacon on the side was terrible (limp and flavorless).    While I was sitting there, some young guys started to assemble in a corner booth and I thought to myself, \"Jesus, is this a hipster convention?\"  I swear to god, they all looked identical, straight out of the guidebook.  Then, I kid you not, this older balding dude shows up and starts interviewing them.  Apparently they were a band!  Seven of them!  With an album coming out the next day.  I didn't catch the name (or any autographs, haha).  What a wretched cliche.  Of course they did not order breakfast, just coffee and water.  But twice they made Jagermeister jokes while I rolled my eyes.  Actually my eye muscles got a lot of exercise during that half-hour."}
{"text":"I can only review this venue in a late night, 3am, post clubbing capacity as it is the only time I have ever been. The reason I have a sort of fondness for the 24 hour diner is that it reminds of the the amazingness that is the US diner culture. I have memories of wonderful diners in every US state I have been in and the fact that there are some replicas in Toronto is great.  The first time I came here it was at about 3am and there was a line. In my opinion the bouncer has some sort of God complex typically seen in employees of hot nightclubs in Las Vegas, New York or Miami. I didn't feel such a complex was required in the queue manager of a diner in Toronto but he definitely had it. He let his friends or other randoms cut in ahead and was generally rather unfriendly. Perhaps this behaviour is more tolerable if one has had more drinks. The second time there was no line as I came around 4:30am and this method of entry was much more to my liking.  Both times I have had the grilled cheese with asiago and subbed in sweet potato fries. My other friends have ordered burgers and they are decent, generous portions. The first server I had was wonderful but my most recent was pretty inattentive, given that the place was less busy that usual. She also charged me a nasty extra $3 for the sweet potato fry sub.  So in conclusion, for a late night hangout to get a late night snack, sober up or continue hanging out this place hits the spot. It is also an excellent place to score a waiting taxi given that cabbies know most patrons leaving the venue at this time will be making their weary journey home.  I also heard Guy Fieri from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives recently filmed an episode here and sampled the apple pie milkshake (a whole slice of apple pie, vanilla ice cream and milk). I don't know how that would go following a Saturday evening of drinking but I am intrigued none the less..."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I started coming here in the early 90s (before you were born) and it was (surprisingly) one of the only places in the city where you could get a non-dairy milkshake. I always loved it here, great variety on the menu, good prices etc...I haven't been here for a few years, so thought I'd check it out. We arrived at 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday. It was half empty, no one else waiting to be seated, 5 servers all milling about the front counter, clearly seeing us and yet no acknowledgement (if you ignore me, I promise you, I'm not going away). I turned to my dining companion and said \"Do you see me? I see you.\" She confirmed that yes, I was, in fact, visible. After standing there waiting for 8 minutes (SERIOUSLY LAKEVIEW??), we were finally seated. Our server was great, friendly, efficient etc (young, blonde woman). However, after placing our order at 5:30 (I'm no fool - at this point, I was timing everything) there were only 4 other tables in the place, all having eaten before us, our meals didn't arrive until 5:44 (we didn't order anything unusual/taking lots of time to make). The food was okay, but by this time I felt not only disappointed by the lack of cohesion (not to mention the guy who apparently used to work here, was seated after us, and - surprise, surprise- received his food - not to mention the staff discount - before us) while his former work mates all gathered around, yelling loudly behind us as we STILL waited for our meals. Disappointed to say the least. This is precisely why I write these reviews - so that places of business who think they can treat customers/clients badly a) have a better sense of what's going on with their staff while they're not there or b) understand why they get negative reviews. I'm seriously disappointed. I'd rather spend my hard earned Canadian bucks on a place that doesn't think that we'll just go away if you ignore us. Don't waste your time, there are PLENTY of great places who will gladly serve you (even if you're not a hipster - which, by the way, is SO New York City circa 2009). Hmph."}
{"text":"I think the people leaving the negative reviews might be a little picky or had unrealistically high  expectations for an old school diner like this one. I'm a simple girl... I don't need an eclectic menu or a modernly decorated setting to enjoy a meal. That being said, I left The Lakeview full and satisfied in both food taste/quality and customer service.   It's a classic restaurant with a cheap drinks, lots of food to choose from and friendly servers. Don't go here if you're expecting fine dining like the Distillery District, or a hip atmosphere like Roncey. It's perfectly fine for what it is.   I ordered a mixed green salad, and a standard burger and fries. Pretty simple this time around. The veggies and fries were fresh and crisp, the bun was soft and the meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. No complaints.   It's 24 hours. Bonus if you live in the area.  Give it a try! Don't be too influenced by the poor reviews."}
{"text":"They have $4 caesars all the time, and $3 mimosas, which probably would make it a great brunch place. We went around 4pm and I had only fries, which were ok - but nothing special. Food felt like it was hit or miss, but the service was great! Our extreme poutine platter was mediocre, the highlight being the hamburger meat which was well seasoned, but forgotten initially on our platter. The waitress brought it immediately as soon as we had noticed.  The $4 caesars are pretty good - standard caesars. My friends ordered a slice of pie to share, and when the waitress brought it, she said it looked a bit small and grabbed another slice free of charge.  Definitely would go back for the caesars and diner vibe, but would rather try other food items!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Lakeview many, many times before, so I figured maybe I should finally write a review.  Obviously, the big attraction here are the absurdly cheap drink specials. (On this particular night, I enjoyed several glasses of the very tasty Spark House Red Ale for $4 a pop.) The food, however, is generally pretty consistent and exactly as greasy and filling as you'd hope.  We ate:  Coney Fries (Chili, Melted Cheddar, and Chive Sour Cream): I've had this on many occasions prior and I'll admit that this wasn't one of the better times. The chili seemed too thick somehow, which meant that the whole thing wasn't as irresistibly saucy as it usually is. It's still quite good, though.  The Lakeview Clubhouse Stack (Classic Triple-Decker with Cornflake Chicken, Strip Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, and Sweet Chili Mayo on Whole Wheat): Okay, now this I really liked. The sandwich is impressively crammed with ingredients and everything works together really well. The highlight is the cornflake chicken, which is flavorful and has those almost crispy edges that I love. The accompanying salad was pretty decent, too.  You'd think that'd be enough for two people, but after eating we were still feeling a little peckish, so we also ordered:  Philly Cheesesteak Poutine (with Sauteed Onion and Bell Pepper): After the somewhat disappointing Coney Fries, this really hit the spot. The plentiful cheesesteak atop the fries was definitely one of the better variations I've had of late, with the melt-in-your-mouth meat pairing perfectly with the generous portion of cheese. This one's a winner and I'm pretty sure it'll be replacing the Coney Fries as a regular order."}
{"text":"It looks awesome inside. But the food is bland and the service is really bad if you go late at night. Large portions though!"}
{"text":"Dear the Lakeview: you've been hyped up so much that my review can only be taken with a grain of salt, or maybe more than a grain - the amount served in your brunch dishes...  Tons of my friends are repeat lovers of Lakeview. They rant and rave about how great each visit is, to the point that I just had to organize a huge brunch outing with lots of people so to properly sample this magical diner. Unfortunately it was a bit of a let down, and that's me being a very kind reviewer.   Our group of 6 got seated relatively fast, considering the massive brunch line-up. We got one of the dimly lit booths in the back, but realistically it comfortably seats 4. One friend just had a knee surgery so we requested to switch spots and was repeatedly promised a relocation, but it never happened. The decor of the diner is great, but it's so chaotic on Sunday mornings that it detracts from the friendliness that a diner typically exudes.   Between all of us we ordered the poutine lakeview, clubhouse stack, cornflake chicken, standard burgers (x2), disco fries, fungi town and a side of crab cakes. I had heard that mushroom gravy was used in the poutine and I love vegetable gravy, but it ended up being oversalted and especially unappetizing with thin dried up peameal. The burgers were equally mundane and I was really disappointed with the crab cake, which also presented itself dried and shriveled. The chicken turned out juicy, but we were all chugging too much water (on account of the salt) by the end of our meal to notice. Is this why its revered as a brunch spot? Electrolytes galore for the hungover mob?   I plan to return again when it's less busy, maybe on a weekday, maybe in the evening. When there are places on the west side/Ossington like Mitzi's or Levack Block around, why the hype for the Lakeview?"}
{"text":"The server raved about the god damned Tuna Melt, but it was such piece of shit. Seriously.  This place is redeemed for being a decent booze-sponge hangout, but stay away from that fucking Tuna Melt."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews about this place but I can't recall having an outright awful experience. Except for this one time I found a bullet in my omelette.  Just had the tuna melt today and it was great. No bullets. The side salad was limp but hey, no one got shot and that's all that matters.  Had a Grasshopper Wheat beer. Came with a pretty big hunk of lemon. I put the lemon in my water. The guys at the table were pretty impressed.   I also like the cornflake chicken sandwich here. Try ordering it with a side of bullets and see what they say. Lol.  I only get the chicken and the tuna here. I hear everything else isn't that great."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard The Lakeview reopened for business.  Nowadays it seems that these comfortable, no frills, greasy spoons are closing at a regular pace, but usually this is due to either high rents or the family deciding to call it quits after many years. Since its reopening, the atmosphere of comfort is still felt, which is a great selling point for me as a return customer. I'm not sure if it's the dark woodwork of the bar, the retro appliances, the original fixtures, or the cozy yet stiff booths, but you feel at ease once you walk through the doors that few restaurants seem to able to capture.   I come to The Lakeview on a semi-regular basis, usually on a whim when I'm leaving a bar nearby and don't want to be tempted to eat at the 24-hour McDonald's near my house. It's one of the few restaurants where I feel very comfortable eating there by myself: I come in, sit at the bar, read my book or a newspaper, and enjoy a good meal. On a weekend evening, I'm usually not the only single person at the bar and sometimes I end up chatting to the person next to me or with some of the wait staff. So far, they've been friendly, and depending on which day or night I visit, I recognize a few of them and we'll end up striking up a conversation. But my visits aren't limited to late night ones, I come here for brunch, weekday evenings for a quick and easy dinner, and it's a reliable date spot too.  I don't remember how the food tasted before the renovations but the menu is certainly more sophisticated now. With each of my visits, I try to have something different on the menu but I'm the type of person that if I like something a lot, I have to repeat the experience again. So far, here are my impressions on what I've tried:   - The Turbo breakfast sandwich may looked greasy but luckily after a few bites it wasn't. It comes with a mixed green salad, sunflower seeds and a vinegrette. It's a good combo of grease and healthy, and perfect as a late night meal - The Quattro Grilled Cheese sandwich is a heart-attack waiting to happen. I love grilled cheese but feel that their fourth element - the feta - empowers all the other cheeses in the sandwich and therefore, it's the least of my favourite - The Lakeview Clubhouse Stack sandwich is simply delicious, and reliable sandwich if nothing else catches your eye.  - The Nighthawk: I had something similiar to this dish but the one I had was a special that day so the sides were slightly different. If you get the New York Striploin, please do so, it is absolutely delicious and will melt in your mouth like butter. It came with roots vegetables, wild mushrooms and a garlicky mash potatos - Poutine isn't filled with fancy ingredients but that's why it's so good. If you want simplicity, get the poutine - Root beer floats and sweet potato fries are late-night staples, I've had them numerous times and they're always a favourite - $3 Mimosas taste particularly divine on a weekend morning  The dislikes: There's one bathroom stall for the women's washroom. I'm sure it's the same in the men's washroom but I haven't had to go there. The one stall is particularly annoying when it's a busy brunch weekend, and I've also seen it not working properly. Again, really annoying.   Another dislike about the new Lakeview is that it's missing the large retro portrait of the three girls in green bathing suits jumping in the air. It hung (or perhaps it was painted) on the back wall in the main dining area, and I loved looking at that painting whenever my friends and I visited the restaurant. I wish that the new owners had either kept it or tried to obtaining it again, but it suited the space very well."}
{"text":"Expect longer than usual wait times and serving times when showing up later at night. Predominantly hipster crowd and an interesting place to eat post-partying.  Great poutine--suggest ordering as an appy and sharing with the group. Large portions with decent prices."}
{"text":"My friend and I had just finished working a night shift and decided to get breakfast.  We came to Lakeview and shared the Ossington Massive.  Seeing that we were the only patrons in the restaurant, we thought it'd be a quick in and out.  However after 30 mins at 8:15 am, did our food arrive.  The waitress explained that the kitchen was changing hands. Noted, but our meal was cold and stale. Sausages were burnt and cold...you would think freshly burnt sausages would be hot! Home fries tasted a day old, and our eggs felt like they had been at room temp for ages.  We aren't the picky types, however we could not find any positives in this experience. Unfortunately, we were too early to get mimosas...but I think it would have made the waiting time and food more bearable."}
{"text":"It's always open and has deep fried mars bars ... need I say more?"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that when I stumbled in I already had 3 beers in me, and on top of that I took advantage of their $4 Blanche de Chambly special, but I thought the Lakeview was pretty good.  I opted for a BLT, my friend had some sort of all day breakfast special.  Both of us licked our plates clean.  Add 2 beers and the bill came to $30 including tax and tip.  No complaints here.  Not the kind of establishment I'd frequent in the daylight, but it's a great post-midnight spot!"}
{"text":"I came here late on a Sunday night for the first time. I have heard about this place for a while. My wife had the corn flake chicken sandwich and I had the Freedom Toast, it was the brie that sold me. Overall the food was pretty good, but nothing mind blowing. I would come back again just for the milkshake. I thought it was pretty cool that they put slices of pie into your shake. We ordered the vanilla with apple pie and it was really good. I'd give it 3 stars, but the bartender/waiter earned an extra."}
{"text":"We kept passing by the Lakeview Lunch while it was getting renovated.... couldn't wait for it to reopen.   What an interesting place... a great location, 24 hour service, a fully stocked bar... the perfect combination.  Right?    My girlfriend kept telling me about how the place was the set for the movie \"Boondock Saints\", which is supposed to be quite a good flick.    How could it go wrong?  We arrive at the place.  It's jam packed with hipsters.   The ubiquitous collection of Ossington characters...  brooding men with facial hair, ironic tshirts and skinny ties, slightly unkempt women with beautiful breasts popping out of tight shirts barely hiding their tramp stamp tattoos,  a waitress that seems to have been teleported from 1955 rural Kansas.  So far, so good.  The menu looks phenomenal.  Very descriptive and interesting.   A delicious-sounding assortment of sandwiches and diner-fare.   We each order some of the more interestingly described entrees and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  An hour goes by.  The food never comes.   Eventually, someone comes by and tells us that there's been a mix-up in the kitchen and that the meals are on the house.   Very cool.  We get ready to enjoy.  Unfortunately, we don't.   The food really isn't that good.    Neither of us liked anything we ate or anything that we saw.      Very pedestrian."}
{"text":"I do like the atmosphere of this place, despite it being overrun with hipsters. The menu is also really exciting, but I probably just made a bad pick this time - DO NOT ORDER THE FISH AND CHIPS. The fish was kind of soggy, and the fries were nothing to write home about. The deep-fried pickles were quite lovely, as were the $4 glasses of Chardonnay! Service was good, and I got to overhear bits of a juicy conversation going on behind me, about this girl dating a married man. I'll be back, just not for the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you have time to burn and strong abs. Came in for brekkie with the hubby. Had a full hour. Got our meal at the 50 minute mark.   The booths are terrible. How does anyone sit in these? The benches are narrow and tilt forward. The table is too close, presumably to keep you from sliding off your bench. Second booth we tried was better. We saw another couple come in and move three times before they found a comfortable table.   Food was just okay, but overpriced for what you get.   On a positive note...if you have social anxiety, you'll love this place. The waitstaff almost never come by."}
{"text":"After party snacks and conversations! Almost a 5 star but had problems w burgers cooked too rare more than once. Everything else on menu Delish! Macaroni and cheese bites yummm"}
{"text":"This place is a guaranteed good time at any time of the day. During the holidays they have a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings. Not to mention the cheap drinks, mimosas are one of my go to's.   Deep fried pickles are delicious and anything you can crave the Lakeview seems to not disappoint. A toronto staple worth going to a few times and at different times of the day."}
{"text":"It was late, I was tired.  We had tried an insanely crowded and tiny hole in the wall across the street but were unable to obtain anything that was crammed full of essential fats and calories.  I didn't want to stand in a queue around the corner to hear a band I knew nothing about after stumbling off a touring musical contraption of my own.  I had to drive so I was sober.  Boo  Urns.   Having gotten that out of the way, I was pleasantly surprised by the chipper mood of the waiter and his patience dealing with myself, a drummer and a girl from the previously mentioned touring musical contraption who can only speak broken english at best.  The service was prompt and the food was good enough to get me to want to come back and try some more when hopefully I won't be feeling so jaded and bitter (and impoverished) from having to cram myself into the back of a bus for yet another touring musical contraption.  I chatted briefly to a friend a day or two later about my week-end and she commented, \"It sounds like you had a wonderfully hipster weekend!\"  I'm not too sure about that... How many people show up at this place in a tuxedo? (yes...that's my \"uniform\" for most gigs.)"}
{"text":"Absolute worst place. How the hell is this even a thing. I've been here during the day unfortunately...horrid...just horrid. It smells like burnt hot sauce and black mold. And they are open 24/7?....the food gets 100% worse at night... Close it down already it's over lived it's Boondocks Saints reputation."}
{"text":"If you like cheap eats at all hours that taste amazing and ALL DAY BRECKIE, this is the place for you. Love the Lakeview."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to get a drink so I suggested this diner since I had it bookmarked on Yelp for the longest time. I was surprised to see that they sell Stiegl radler so they were already winning me over.  I couldn't resist but to get some snacks to munch on while enjoying our drinks. We got deep fried mac n cheese balls and onion rings. I'm very impressed by the efficiency of this diner because the wait time was basically nonexistence. The deep fried mac n cheese were very cheesy which is right up our alley. The onion rings were one of the best onion rings I've ever had in the city.  The service here was awesome. Our waitress was super friendly and she made sure that everything was going well throughout our short stay at the restaurant. I can't wait to come back here to have an actual meal because I'm impressed by their food and service."}
{"text":"Typical diner fair.  The food was ok, but not great.  The lighting is so dim that you will need to pull out a flashlight.  And because of the lighting I could not tell if the place was clean or not.  The pricing was ok.  The service was ok.  Everything was just ok."}
{"text":"Might have finally found a place in Toronto which knows how to make a kickass Philly cheesesteak sammich, if you can excuse the burger bun they served it on (SACRILEGE!!!!) The side salad was totally kickass too!  Enjoyed the ginger lemonade...but was surprised that it cost $6!!!! On the ambience side, the place has a nice old school Jersey Diner feels, which you know...Home...  PS: One point deducted for the rather warm experience (no airconditioning or ventilation), and another point for a very confused staff...and really $6 for a virgin lemonade!!!"}
{"text":"The beer was cold, free-flowing and altogether too cheap. The waitress was warm, friendly and attentive. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"HIPSTERS, HIPSTERS EVERYWHERE! I'm serious. They're all sitting at the bar when you come in and go out. Good this they have some. Very large booths in the back away from the hoards of hipsters! The food is actually pretty good surprisingly. This place has been here forever and I ordered the ossington massive ( mainly cause I grew up in the area and liked the name) the food was fresh and there was tons of it! I was stuffed, I ordered the chocolate milkshake with Oreos even though I'm lactose intolerant the milk shake was good so it was worth it... Lol. The price is good for the huge portions you receive and this place is open 24/7 does it get better then that? If your ever craving a diner burger or breakfast any time of the day this is your place! Service is also superb! Will return!"}
{"text":"The immediate positives of the Lakeview is that they are open 24 hours (and also have a 24 hour breakfast like every good diner restaurant should have), and have an extensive menu. This is definitely a place you could keep coming back to.  I ended up at the Lakeview this weekend for Brunch, because Saving Grace down the street had a huge line, and has 5 tables, and they weren't seating anyone. I had always thought of going to the Lakeview, as I pass it all the time, and had only been there for a drink before, but then when it was on the recent Canadian episodes of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, and I saw something that I had to have... the freedom toast.  The freedom toast is an egg dipped baguette, with peameal bacon, brie and havarti cheese stuffed on the inside. Think of it as a french toast sandwich. You get a generous amount with 3 egg dipped sandwiches. Comes with maple syrup on the side for dipping or pouring. What I really appreciate with their breakfast items is that they all come with greens, fruit, and homemade chips (thin fried potato chips). The chips were great as they were big and not too oily. The greens and fruit really help bring some freshness to the plate, and make you believe you are really eating something healthy for you. The meal really has everything: bread, cheese, meat, greens, fruit, potatoes, maple syrup! So yes, I highly recommend it, and at $12.50 it won't break the bank either.  And lastly, the place is huge, so you probably will never have to wait for a table, and isn't that what we all want?"}
{"text":"What an amazing 24-hour diner right in close proximity to so many of Ossington's great bars! This place offers an abudance to choose from to feed any craving you just might be having on a late night after the bar, and they also pass as a great place to grab a morning/mid-afternoon breakfast.   I came here with a bunch of other Yelpers after a wonderful event and got sucked into their extensive menu of food. I was so impressed by all of the choices they had to offer. It also didn't hurt that they had a pretty unique cocktail menu. Having already had my fill of drinks and looking for something nice and greasy I decided to split the Lakeview poutine with a friend. This poutine offered a pretty good serving of fries including regular cut fries and sweet potato fries topped with classic cheese curds and feta cheese, a garlic onion crunch, a wild mushroom saute, peameal bacon and a succulant house gravy. It certainly hit the spot!   I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great bite to eat when in the area. I will certainly be back after this experience."}
{"text":"This is a great place to be if you're in the Ossington and Dundas area and craving for a late night diner. It's lively and energetic. The staff members are always in a great mood.   The milkshakes are amazing! The apple pie milkshake is so different than any other milkshake and even has apple pie pieces in it! For me, it wasn't too sweet but I really like sweet things in general.   I had the Coca Cola float (can't remember what it's called on the menu) and the little bit of caramel drizzle added was just perfect. Made it taste different than any other float I've ever had. Just sucked that the floats weren't refillable for the pop.   The burgers here are very good. My bf loves burgers and from what he told me, it didn't disappoint. He had The Lakeview burger.   I had the cornflake chicken and tbh, it wasn't that great. I could only eat half of it before I just had to stop. The meat itself; cooked in cornflakes; tasted like it was burnt and it was black. It was hard and just difficult to eat. Maybe that's how it was supposed to be? Either way, I wouldn't recommend the cornflake chicken.  All in all, like I said in the beginning, this place is lively and fun. You can even order free handshakes!"}
{"text":"If you're here at 3 am, then you're probably not the pickiest of eaters, and will devour scraps.  But, you're in luck, because you're in Toronto- the greatest city in the world- and the Lakeview, happens to have the most elaborate menu you'd expect for a 24 hour diner! Never had diner food taste so good. From the late night menu, I had the Fish and Chips, with Kimchi & Lemon Tartar, and they were absolutely delicious. The \"chips\"- fries- were perfect, and the fish was not greasy. The filet of the fish tasted very fresh. I certainly wasn't expecting gourmet dining at that hour, but that's what I got. My friend ordered The Standard, which was equally good. It was accompnied by rye bread, and strawberries. The meals were HUGE! The service was also excellent. The orange juice is fantastic."}
{"text":"D'you just pour that $3 special pint in a tall imperial -- maybe more -- glass? And did you just garnish my pastrami & burger burger with fried pickle spear at the top of the toothpick flagpole -- mighty pickled cuke tack in the wind!   On a Thursday night -- around maybe 10pm? -- there was maybe a 20 minute wait for a table, so we saddled up to the counter, which I enjoy much much more when alone or with another. And, on Valentine's Night... what's more adorable than a softly-lit late night diner together? Harry, Sally? Your regret was that you couldn't sit at a counter because you're not real and Rob Reiner needed a table in the middle of the room... but we all know... that's the worst table in the room. Plus, Harry, guess what... she picked me up from the airport the very first time.   The Lakeview has the proud distinction of being the very first place I spent Canadian money at, or, wait, maybe I was treated? Either way, first stop: The Lakeview.   And while I was told the Poutine here isn't the best... all it takes for me to be happy is to see potatoes in tube form dressed in the dark brown gravy like a slender Swede in Merino Wool.   Service steadfast. Lighting golden hued more than the fried pickle. Deco glass trimmings. Side pony & sleeveless hostess. Nicked wood. Employees ponied up next to us who took the gesture of scooting down a stool so kindly they concocted a pink boozy shot with pop rock rimmed glasses just for us. Not necessarily what I imagined to be the most romantic clink of glasses ever, but, hell, Canada, I've just arrived, and your Cupid (is it the same Cupid?) shot me right in my stool-wobbling rump at The Lakeview. In this lighting, I never want to leave."}
{"text":"Really, does this place need a bouncer?  Went here late on a Saturday night, in search of dessert. The very rude bouncer was on a power trip, so we opted not to go after all.   There was a small line, but every other restaurant seems to manage just fine without turning their 24-hour diner into some kind of exclusive club."}
{"text":"My friend ordered the cornflake chicken sandwich, which was delicious.  I, however, ordered the Le Plateau burger and it left a lot to be desired.  Dry, tasteless, blah.  Don't order a burger."}
{"text":"I finally gave the Lakeview another chance.  I showed up at 4am-ish, to avoid the crowds.  The chocolate milkshake was the BEST milkshake I have ever had in my life.  And I have had many a milkshake.    I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they make their poutine with vegetarian (mushroom based) gravy.  At the time, I thought the only problem was that they needed to make sure the gravy was heated up to a temperature that would make the cheese melt properly when poured onto the fries.  I later spoke with another vegetarian friend who told me that he had asked his waiter there to look at the ingredients of the gravy they use.    I was unpleasantly surprised to hear that it actually contains animal fat.  Way to go Lakeview.  I take back anything good I said about the poutine.  The Lakeview just might be the place for late night snacking, but they seem to be running an amateur operation.   I continue to meet folks at area bars and restaurants, and they all say that the food just isn't up to par.    And what's with all the menus smelling TOXIC???  Is it the paper they're printed on?"}
{"text":"I love Canada, I love Toronto especially, and this place just happens to be in Toronto, what do ya know.  I came across this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on Food Network. I was coming up to Toronto for a weekend trip, and the episode this place was on, happened to be the one I was tuned into. They were talking about apple pie milkshakes, yes, apple pie milkshakes. When hearing this, I knew I had to make it there.  The Lakeview is located in the city, however not in the main tourist part, so you will have to venture out a little bit. Located near a busy intersection, the Lakeview sits with their diner style restaurant. Walking in, it's as if you were taken back to an old fashioned diner, and I absolutely love it. There is also outdoor seating as well, for those warmer months.  I always always always, get a burger when I come here because they are amazing."}
{"text":"Eight adults for lunch. Four from Toronto, four from the States. Orders ranged from steak, to deli sandwiches, to the famous cornflake chicken, a portobello sandwich, and a Bestest.  The portobello was easily the best sandwich consumed. All the rest were just sort of okay. The cornflake chicken club sandwiches were more bread than chicken. The sweet potato fries were terrific. The deep-fried Mars bar was heavenly.  The manager Nancy and the waitstaff were charming and attentive.  This review is more about the food than the pleasant atmosphere and the waitstaff. The most celebrated item on the menu was good but not outstanding. We all came to the Lakeview after seeing it featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. We all agreed that if we lived in the local area we would eat there, but not necessarily become regulars."}
{"text":"Ahh Lakeview - quintessentially west ender late night/hungover brunch spot that is now all about the hipsters. From what this place used to be, to what it is now, i'm disappointed.  Food quality has really gone down. Menu offerings are no longer interesting.  Being 24 hours is now it's only saving grace."}
{"text":"I ordered the burger with a side of poutine. Burger was dry and I wouldn't order it again. Poutine was good. Pint of beer was the daily special, so that was a bonus.  Overall, its just a typical diner and food is ok. Nothing to scream home about and some menu items are hit or miss. I wouldn't go back out of my way. Prices are a bit more then a typical dinner too."}
{"text":"New fav place. Must go back. Let me explain why.  Open 24 hours.   Cheep great coffee.  Decor that makes me feel like I'm in a movie. A cool movie.   Yummy pie a la mode.  Done deal. I love it. Oh and apparently Tarintino once ate here? I believe it."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for Family Day breakfast and, although the place was packed with a huge waiting list, the staff were super organized and accommodating.  Great food (HUGE club sandwiches), lots of coffee and inexpensive mimosas.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"VIBE  I've only ever been here after midnight, so I'm part of the drunken hungry hipster crowd sprawling out from The Dakota, Communist's Daughter et al.  But for a 24/7 joint, this is one of the classiest. I live how they mix retro with modern, which completely capitalizes on their market. Plus, you can' t go wrong with the colour of powdered blue.   I EAT  Poutine. Pulled Pork Poutine, to be more specific. It's greasy, it's gooey, it's hearty. It's everything you want when you're craving poutine after 11 p.m and can't get it anywhere else. So basically the equivalent of a bed buddy but much more satisfying because poutine doesn't shy away from commitment. It's always there for you.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Late night. Not outta sight. Yummy poutine."}
{"text":"Great late night grub.  Ladies: if you need to use the loo and are somewhat inebriated, make sure you escape from breaking your neck on the protruding pipe adjacent to the door in that tiny, tiny restroom. In the unassuming words of our city's own Aubrey Drake Graham: \"Thank me later.\""}
{"text":"This place was suggested to me while visiting in Toronto due to the Diner show on the Food Network visiting the location.  This place was amazing!  We had the mushroom Benny, Eggy in a basket  and the Freedom Toast.  I can't even describe how amazing the Freedom Toast was!! The Benny was fresh with a salad and a side of chips.  I wish I lived closer because this would be my regular spot!"}
{"text":"3 stars for establishments who have been around for a long time, can't bombard a place with negative comments that's been curing hangovers and broken hearts for years right?  But this one time, I shall complain...a bit.. because their two berries were so disappointing to look at, let alone taste these failures beside pancakes that came out cold and bland and I could really go on and on but what did you expect from a place where staffers look fatigued out, that asking for water can lead to a resounding 'not worth it' feeling after placing a 20% tip because tipsy me was feeling generous.  My server was probably confused as well, he sounded like he had a chronic back pain that made life completely uneasy for the both of us so getting tipped probably had him thinking I was too drunk for my own good or I had crush on his charismatic yawning while he took down our order.  Point is, not a place I'd go back to on a whim or even being dragged into after long hours of debate on where to grab some late late grub after a night out."}
{"text":"i've been here twice and i'm at a loss as to why people like this place. the history? the atmosphere? the location?   old-fashioned decor can be charming, but not when things look like they're falling apart.  i'm not sure if there's no AC, if it's busted or if management is just too cheap to turn it on. nevertheless, in 29C weather, dining is unpleasant. actually, it was stifling to sit in the restaurant. good beer couldn't alleviate this.   the service is okay, but all things considered, lakeview is a waste of time/money and just a place that offers non-cheap, un-delicious calories. the food choices are typical diner, which isn't bad in itself, but the execution is horrible. the burger is under-seasoned and dry to the point of being crumbly. the fries are greasy and the salad is wilted.  i can't recommend this place to anybody. there are tastier alternatives close by."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is an old fashioned diner with a mid 20th century decor and feel. It looks well worn and enjoyed for many years. I ordered a club sandwich and a beer, and it was delicious. The menu has lots of choices like burgers, fish and chips, and some great brunch items. Clientele was business people, a few students and local residents. Service was friendly and fast. Comfort food in a comfy unpretentious place."}
{"text":"This place is worth a go! I went with a small group of friends on a weekend. We didn't have to wait long though it was full capacity from what I could tell. I started with a Mimosa which was delicious and not your regular mimosa using orange juice.  Sadly the day I went I had a really upset stomach so the only thing I ordered was sweet potato fries but they were great and much much better than their potato fries. Food here is very well priced, large portions, good menu.  I will have to go again and update once I actually get to eat something substantial!"}
{"text":"Man, I really adore this place.  I've been coming here for a few years now, though very infrequently. However, every visit has been outstanding. The diner itself is an old Toronto institution and if you're new to the city, visiting for a while, or are a resident who hasn't tried it yet, you better get your butt over there soon for a good meal and a chill time. The menu offerings consists of pretty standard diner fare from your favourite brunch eggs benny for your morning after a heavy drinking session, to comforting veggie chili for cold fall nights. But the food is great, they do everything their own way and a little differently than other places. Today, I had the Fungi Town salad with bacon. The confit roasted garlic on top was amazing and perfectly dressed. The menu is huge so I haven't tried everything but everything I have had was just great. You can also get classic old school diner stuff here like BLTs, burger and fries, and an old fashioned milkshake...I have yet to try one of these. I always think of the scene from Pulp Fiction in the diner when Vincent takes a sip of Mia's milkshake and comments on how it's a damn good milkshake, but it ain't worth the five bucks.  Today, I came here alone for a nice lunch and some coffee while I did a bit illustration work. I took a 2-person booth for myself and stayed a good long time without being harassed by the wait staff, but were attentive enough to ask me if I needed more coffee or another drink. Oh, and drinks are damn cheap here. My whiskey sour came up to $4 and it was a good strong drink. The Caesars here are also pretty decent, especially at under $10 a pop.   Service here is a little spotty, but nothing ever atrocious. I don't come here regularly enough to comment on how reliable the service is but it's good enough for me; no major complaints. The funnest thing about this place, though, is the fact that it was in the movie Boondock Saints. Check it out if you don't believe me!  This place is open 24/7 so you have no excuse not to try it out. The food is great, prices are very reasonable, and it's just a nice place to be when you just want to take a break from it all."}
{"text":"The burger was dry and the poutine was a bit salty, but other than that everything was pretty good. The burger was yummy other than being dry and it appears to be made of fresh patty but I could be wrong. The service was fast, and there was a lineup out the door with a bouncer! Our server loves the place, saying he used to come here before he worked there and now he still loves it. That says a lot because many people wouldn't eat where they work.  The cost of a burger that came with a side poutine was about $15 plus tax and tip. Not cheap for diner food but I'm guessing the premium pricing for being a 24-hour joint that caters to hungry, drunk people."}
{"text":"I love being taken to the places the locals dig.  My cousin states they have the best poutine, though I only stole a couple bites off her dish, I would have to agree.  I had this amazing club sandwich, and a local microbrew whose name I've already forgotten.  It's the epitome of a classic diner."}
{"text":"When did Lakeview Lunch become The Lakeview? Oh how the times are a-changing! I used to frequent this dingy greasy spoon when I was living on Ossington. It was the go-to for all day brekkie regardless of whether it was two in the a.m. or p.m. After just one visit post-revamp though, I am already convinced that a change did this place good.    The face lift given to the original (and therefore now considered vintage) furnishings has given everything a polished Pleasantville feel. The waitresses of old have been replaced with enthusiastic servers who seem to thrive on the glow of the light bulb and desire nothing more than to serve you happiness on a plate.   The updated menu is larger and shinier than ever with new tantalizing descriptions and even includes a considerable selection of wines (by the bottle!?), local draughts, and specialty beers. Our server had me at the soup of the day, \"corn chowder\", but then he announced the draught special:  \"Creemore\" and I was reduced to nodding and salivating. The sweet, sweet, sweet potato fries were naturally sweet and crispy and served with the most flavourful ancho-chili-garlic mayo ever. My late night dinner date did the honours of testing out the all important hamburger and milkshake which were reported as tops too. I also ordered a free handshake and was immediately served a resounding smack of high five with a side of hearty chuckle.  The Lakeview might not be just down the street from my place or even feel like the same place I used to love anymore, but it's different and that might just even mean better."}
{"text":"A bowl of chili after walking to the Lakeview on a cold night is highly recommended.  What's with the coded dots on the floors in front of the booths?"}
{"text":"Place has been around since beginning of time. Institution as far as classic diners are concerned and still gets rammed on weekends. They still keep to the roots as seen clearly in the outdated decor... but the charm is still there. Food menu is massive! Be prepared to spend 15 minutes just picking stuff out.   I ordered fried chicken with a poutine, and split a bunch of different appetizers. Nothing memorable except chomping into a frozen drumstick that night.. but I am sure it was a one off. Good selection of local craft beer. Probably go back again one of these days."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place or my first pick for pub fare, but Cheap drinks, all day breakfast and a diverse menu... can't really go wrong if you're just out to get hammered and pig out on salty snacks.   Sweet potato fries are nice and thick..   The Caesar was a bit salty for my liking and the wine is not so great.. but again, $4 .. you get what you pay for.   Beers are good and cheap. They have drink specials for every day of the week."}
{"text":"Oh, wow!  I don't know what happened... Had this been our first experience, it would also have been our last.    Based on our first visit, I was completely looking forward to going back.  It was noon on a Sunday, the place was pretty busy so our twosome had to wait a few minutes for a table.  No problem!  We were still seated fairly quickly as two other booths close to ours were being wiped down.  These booths filled with a party of 4, and a party of 5 while we placed our order.  Our drinks arrived and our waitress came by a few short minutes after having sat down to ask if my boyfriend wanted a refill on his coffee.  And then, nothing...  Just shy of forty (40) more minutes passed and our waitress breezed by several times, not once did she make eye contact, not once did she check to see if we wanted a refill on our drinks (I actually could have used a second OJ).  And then... the party of 5 who arrived AFTER us received their food order.... hmmm...  We flagged down our waitress and mentioned that we had been waiting for quite a while for our order.    Now, had 'I' been 'HER', this is what 'I' would have done: I would have smiled and cheerfully apologized for the wait.  I would have topped up the drinks, I would even have made the REFILLS complimentary, and I would have said that I would go and check with the kitchen to see about the wait.  And WHY would I have done this?  Because I USED to do this.  I waitressed all through college, and admittedly, I sucked at it.  I was the waitress that was completely scatterbrained and disorganized.  I was the waitress that would confuse orders and forget which table ordered what.  But you know WHAT?  I was the waitress that regulars always ask for.  WHY?  Because I had a good attitude and didn't make my problems or the restaurants problems my customers problems.  People LIKED me, and ATTITUDE goes a LONG WAY.  But since 'I' was not 'her' and 'she' was not 'me', this is what really happened: she cringed, she sighed, she looked annoyed and in a bit of a huff stated very matter of factly that the place was busy and each patron could expect a 20 to 25 minute wait.  And then she walked away.  STRIKE ONE.  Shortly afterward our food arrived.  Yay!  ... But... no.  I had the french toast with fresh fruit on the side (2 slices each of melon, grapefruit, and orange).  I don't doubt that the fruit WAS fresh, it tasted quite fresh, but the top few slices were somewhat dried out.  My french toast was not hot, it was warm and dry.  My boyfriend had the eggs and sausage with mixed greens and the same sliced fruit plus sweet potatoes on the side.  The fresh stuff was not so fresh just like mine.  He didn't comment on his eggs, the sweet potatoes were practically burnt to a crisp and the sausages were ROCK HARD.  I am not even kidding here people, he barely ate half of each piece.  Our assumption was that the meals were likely sitting under a heating lamp for an extended period of time.  The waitress never came by to ask how our meal was, or to see if we needed a refill on our drinks. STRIKE TWO.  Partially out of prolonged hunger, partially because we just wanted to get out of there, we wolfed down as much as we could eat (we both left food on our plates) and flagged down the waitress for the bill.  My boyfriend pointed out his barely touched sausages and told the waitress that they were ROCK HARD and therefore could not eat them.  She said she would check with the chef, then returned all of about a minute later with the bill.  Wow, that must have been a quick conversation!  No explanations, no apologies, no comps on the bill of any kind, just dropped it on the table and walked away.  STRIKE THREE.  Mediocre food and terrible service, a complete 180 from our first visit.  I am undecided if I will ever return."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us went after working @ the CNE Casino until the wee hours of the morning to have breakfast before heading to bed....The place has a lot of character and looks like it has seen better days but the reputation for the quality of foods allows most to overlook the decor or lack there of... I had an incredible appetite and ordered The Ossington Massive... It was all I expected and then some...Service was very good and the entire group was impressed with their breakfasts as well..."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been back to the Lakeview.  I'm pretty sure last time I was there, they weren't serving booze.  Stopped in for a quick drink and snack before a friend's show at the Dakota Tavern.  Liked the cozy booths and old time diner decor.  Great looking menus that look like place mats.  I was an instant fan of their drink specials - daily pints, mimosas, caesars and soda based mixed drinks all for $4.  Their draft selection wasn't anything to sneeze at either.  I promptly ordered a Muskoka Dark Ale and traditional poutine ($7).  Poutine was okay, not the best but definitely passable.  Service was good and quick.  The Lakeview is back on my radar for cheap drinks/snacks and 4am brunch cravings."}
{"text":"Expect to wait.  Today, my friend and I waited about 25 minutes for a seat (they fucked up and bypassed us so we had to wait a little longer... although, we ended up getting the better table anyway).  And then, we waited another 25 minutes or so for our food.  They were apologetic but it would have been nice for them to offer us something for waiting so long.  Good customer service, y'know?  But seriously?  The food is soooo amazing, it's almost worth the insane wait time.  And really, if you go anywhere else in the area, you'll probably have to wait a similar amount of time anyway.  I had the Eggs Lakeview, which was delicious, and felt a little healthier than the regular Eggs Benedict (rather than Hollandaise sauce, they serve it with a \"jerk yogurt\").  It was pretty tasty and the mixed greens were really great... the dressing does so much amazing stuff to a salad!!  And they've got sooo many delicious brunchy alcoholic drinks!  Overall, I'm giving them 4 stars because I keep going back!"}
{"text":"I had the porky burger with sweet potato fries which comes with Pulled pork came on it and it was really good only down side was that the pulled pork didn't have much if any BBQ sauce on it. Other than that the food was great and cheap.our server was friendly and speedy ; always coming to make sure everything  was good. will definitely come back here again :)"}
{"text":"I used to like this place because of their sheppards pie but I had it tonight and it was the most disgusting thing I've had. It tasted quite sour and the smell was pugnant. My husband had the club sandwich and found it quite midiocre. There wasn't enough spicy mayo on it. Also, the young man who had a comb over and some tattoos on his arm who was serving us spilled water all over the table not even apologizing or offering us napkins let alone offering to clean it up. Quite sad how the service and the food has really gone down. Although, there is a server there named Katelyn and she is the best! On the busy night of New Years, she still had a lot of energy and was very nice. She apologized if she was running a bit behind which is to be expected on New Years Eve."}
{"text":"Went for late afternoon meal.  Ended up having the traditional breakfast.  Simply two eggs and bacon but it was delicious.  I love that they grill the fresh toast so it's soft and a little crunchy at the same time.  came with plenty of salad and fried potato slices which were delicious.  Atmosphere was edgy diner and the staff was very friendly.  Diner food done well!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great spot! Food was delicious! The Freedom Toast is awesome! Service was good, quick in and out. The food was on the table within 10 mins or ordering."}
{"text":"While visiting my sister we picked the Lakeview for dinner since we weren't looking for anything fancy. The decor is nothing special, typical diner look that could use a little love.   Drinks first. I had a Tangy Wishniak (vanilla ice cream, ginger ale and grenadine). It sounds weird but it was REALLY good. My sister had a $3 mimosa which was a decent size for three bucks. And my fiancé had one of their many craft beers.   The food however, I was expecting more from it. I had the fromage a trois (a grilled cheese) that was delicious but I was expecting a much larger portion from a diner. My fiancé had pancakes which were HUGE and they looked delicious. However you had to order extra syrup with a $2.50 charge. Finally my sister had a burger with coney fries. The burger was a decent size, but the fries weren't a sizeable portion. The taste of everything however was pretty delicious.   All in all it was an okay experience. The servers were more focused on their friends and each other but were nice."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place... & i'm not impressed at all.  The menu for one was way too overwhelming, and of course in the dim lighted dining room that made it harder to focus.   It is priced on the higher side. We tried the mint chocolate shake and that was good. Very flavorful. Didn't lack in any mint or chocolate taste. It was 6.99? Most shakes at restaurants go for that price anyways.   We got this deep six on the menu which offered a variety of different finger food that equaled to 6 different foods. This wasn't worth it at all.   The beefeater onion rings were super cold, the sweet potato fries were more on the burnt potato fries side, the chicken wings were very hard and tasted burnt. The deep fried mac n cheese was ok. the fries were alright as well.. and i don't eat pickles lol.   Everything had the same burnt taste to it. With a really hard crunch. I think it's time to change the oil?   I don't think i'll ever be back. The comfortable looking booth seats aren't as comfortable. They go downwards which is pretty hard and awkward to sit on.   The service was meh"}
{"text":"This diner has a bouncer. What kind of diner has a bouncer? Absolutely ridiculous and rude to be met by a hostile man guarding the door when you are hungry and need food and no other place is open.  Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I will need to try this place again because I caved to peer pressure at brunch and had a burger. For some reason, a weekend just isn't right if you start it without eggs! Burger was really good, not too fatty tasting. I had a latte to finish which was ginormous, would have been nicer smaller and stronger, but, my search for a Melbourne-style latte in Toronto will continue! It was super busy, we waited for about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. My Torontonian friend warned me its full of hipsters so I eagerly awaited to see if Canadian Hipsters are the same as Aussie and Kiwi Hipsters. They are :)  I will review again once I try their eggs!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is truly the epitome of a diner. Service was very slow, although our server was very polite and friendly.   My boyfriend and I ordered deep fried pickles, their regular burgers, a chocolate milkshake, and fries. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal, and maybe I'm just picky but I did not enjoy my food... Their burger was very dry and in 4-5 different pieces instead of 1 patty. The beef was crusty on some edges, and cold. They dont add any sauce like mayo, so that wasn't helpful (I'm sure they would've given me the mayo if I asked). The burger had a big wad of purple onions in the middle, and sad bits of pickles here and there. Their fries were soggy, milkshake was aiite, but their deep fried pickles were decent.   Altogether the meal came to about $40 before tip.   If I ever go back, I wont be dining sober."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am a sucker for old timey diners and I love the decor here.  It can be full of hipsters, but I have been a few times on weekday mornings when it's nice and quiet.  Service has been good every time, and you can't beat their $3 mimosa!  Everything I've eaten has been good, not amazing, but good, and their menu is varied and has more than just standard diner fare.  And the best part: they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few more times now and it's begun to grow on me.  I absolutely love their milkshakes and the chocolate peanut butter shake hits the spot every time. I can't say enough about the $3 Mimosas (except they could make them bigger) and I adore the deep fried pickles.  The service is good but beware the Ossington strip 1am-3am rush Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Came here on Canada Day for brunch and it was quite busy. I don't think they were expecting it as there were about 3-4 servers. We were seated within 15 minutes, but the wait for food took a while.  I got the chicken and waffle benny while my boyfriend got the disco poutine. The chicken and waffle benny was okay but I would have rather just had chicken and waffles. The hollandaise sauce was more like a salty and tangy mayo. The chips and salad were okay, but fries would have been better. The disco poutine was not at all what we expected - fries, some gravy, shredded cheese, a sausage cut into 3 or 4 chunks, and some scrambled eggs on top. For the price we were expecting a lot more substance.  Would only come here again to try the mac n cheese balls."}
{"text":"I had one of The B.E.S.T sandwiches of my life here the other night.  The B.E.S.T consists of Bacon, mElted havarti, Spinach, and Tomato, so its basically a BLT with the lettuce swapped for spinach and havarti melted all over.  As a side I had the chili which was also very good.    The service was good, but not great, as the server walked away once while I was trying to ask him a question.  He was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Always Open. I come for the satisfying twin turbos with my choice peameal bacon. Not that spinach, salmon, or portobellos don't make great options. Sweet potato fries served with a spicy mayo tantalize my taste buds each and every time. I can say bad things, although line up are bummers and the music could be lower.  The Lakeview is the one of the BEST 24hr restaurant in Toronto. period ."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the years. Nice space harkening back to the classic diner days of yore. My cousin and I each had the cheese steak sandwiches. Smaller than anticipated and served on a hamburger bun. My previous meals have been breakfasts which were much more satisfying. Tip : the booth tables are narrow, so be prepared to knock knees and rub noses with those seated across. Not cool."}
{"text":"24 hours eatery... Lakeview might not serves the best poutine or has the best services or the nicest deco...   But in the middle of the night and you have some cravings for snacks for whatever reason.. or your Yelp friends just want to chill out somewhere after Elite event and want to have some more cheap booze... Lakeview is a winner!   This place was so busy on a Thursday night..... Services can be a little slow but at least they have free WIFI just ask for password.   Thanks fellow yelpers that shared a table with me let me took photos of their food and even let me try them all...........   Onion Rings  Poutine  Pulled Pork Poutine  Some sandwiches?  Fried Mars Bar   That sounded like a complete meal with appetizers, main and dessert?   I'll be back to Lakeview if I am in the area when nothing else opens...but there are so many interesting places for food in the area..."}
{"text":"After multiple trips to this 24 hour diner, I can definitely say I am a fan. Great service, reliable quality and relaxed atmosphere make this a great place to get a good meal any time of the day. I've tried many different drinks and dishes and I have yet to have anything less than satisfying. Great prices make everything even more delicious! I recommend the milkshakes, deep fried pickles and Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"As much as I want to love the Lakeview, I think I just can't. I had one good brunch here and one good dinner. Besides that, I've had a bunch of crappy meals, including a burger that had a strange soil-like taste to it, and the saltiest poutine in my life.  Staff are always soooo nice and helpful (especially the night staff!), but I think the kitchen needs a lot of work. The poor servers always have to apologize for them, for how long the food takes to cook or how a bunch of the menu items are \"sold out\". I feel like the only way they can change this is with a new menu, and better food. Then, maybe the kitchen should learn how to get food out to a full restaurant within a reasonable amount of time.  That said, they have cheap drinks all the time, and the place is a decent venue to have a couple beers before heading out. Although it's freezing in there sometimes! Drink more to be warmer."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for brunch and dinner. Really good diner food but wasn't a fan of their macaroni and cheese. The blue cheese taints the whole thing. Expect a long wait if you come for brunch on the weekend. Also the pancakes are amazing and the pulled pork sandwich was delicious and huge."}
{"text":"It's not the cheapest or the best, but when I'm near the ossington strip and drunk, I ALWAYS think of the lakeview.   Onion rings are surprisingly amazing (I've had a lot of onion rings in this city), so are the burgers, and heaven on earth: the deep fried mars bar, gotta have it. It can be hit and miss, the eggs benny was awful and watery, Most things are slightly overpriced for their quality. Plus I've never met a staffer here that's been nice. But in the right settings the lakeview is all you need to feel good."}
{"text":"First time visit on Tuesday. My wife had been here once before and she wanted me to try it out. We  came for breakfast. The decor definitely could use a makeover. Nice old building but I think with a little freshning up could be a lot better. Was a little dark in there and kind of had a funny smell. Server was friendly. Food was just okay a little over priced. Kind of weird that they serve you a green salad on the side. A definite first for breakfast! .Not sure that I would hurry back."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto with my father 2 summers ago. That was the best vacation of my adult life. Vacations as an adult were not too hard to beat considering the arrest at spring break, age 21. My father passed away 2 months ago. I decided to retrace our steps and went on a pilgrimage to Toronto. I drank a substantial amount to drown out the memories and pain. I needed food to soak all of that up. I ended up at The Lakeview at 3 AM. I had the burger. It tasted like a gyro. I felt like I was Tom Waits and my life was Nighthawks at the Diner. This was a great place."}
{"text":"This place is an older looking joint with a modern diner menu. Everything is freshly made and it is served extremely fast. Got to try the Freedom Toast  which is the most popular item. The only downside is the restroom situation -- small and disgusting."}
{"text":"It's worth updating when I've branched out of my standard go-tos (fries, Turbo egg sandwich) and n0m-ed down on something truly delicious at The Lakeview:  the tuna melt, y'all.    Not too densely mayo-y, complemented by a coriander pesto (don't knock 'til you try!), right amount of cheese playing off the celery...this was good eatin'.    The service is still spotty, the go-to standards are still predictable, but the tuna melt deserves a little buzz.  N0m it; n0m it good."}
{"text":"The Lakeview is a 24-hour diner at Dundas and Ossington. They serve all day breakfast, brunch from 9-5, sandwiches, burgers and confusingly inexpensive cocktails. Though you might be tempted to sample their 2007 Flat Rock Reisling (you won't really), the smart money is behind their sub-five-buck mimosas and bloody caesars. There are even cheap pints. You can get drunk here, morning, noon, and night. Huzzah!  AND you can eat at the same time. All the food here is of the genre and quality of \"hangover remedy\" so you won't cater your wedding with these guys. It's passable fare. I ordered a cornflake battered chicken sandwich that once inside my gut made a beeline for my aortas. I can't remember what it tasted like so take from that what you will.  The decor is art-deco faux-but-not-exactly-faux retro hipster 24-hour diner. You know what I mean. Decent place for lunch but better for hanging with the post-bar spillover crowd.  N.B. You can barely see the lake from here.  Obligatory Title Pun: Gain some PERSPECTIVE at the Lakeview.  Menu Readability: A four-column one pager in a respectable clean typeface.  Need to mention: If there is a look precisely between JJ Abrams and Jonah Hill, our server had it. An extra star for that. (But then subtract a star forgetting the deep fried Mars bars (not that we would have eaten them anyway (perhaps that foresight deserves an extra star (let's call it even.))))  What this place teaches me about myself: Mimosas. Always."}
{"text":"The lakeview poutine will fix any glum mood."}
{"text":"When Roma's closed down (I religiously went there for their Philly cheese steak- I knew I had to find a new spot and this one may just be it).  Atmosphere: Cute diner feel, could use a bit of a reno without stripping it of its look.  Service: This is a huge hit and miss. I sometimes cringe going there due to my fear of being greeted by the dirty blonde waitress...but I suck it up. The first time I went there it was nice enough to sit on the Patio. The service was extremely laid back but our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu and accommodated our minor tweaks to our meals.  The second time I went- the (dirty blonde-ish) waitress was horrible. We barely tipped her (which I almost felt bad but I replayed our experience in my head and felt no pity again). It took her first of all 10 minutes to come to our table to take ONLY our drink orders and she just walked away (we were clearly ready to order as well,- since we sat there with numb asses for that long). Finally 35 minutes in, we receive our food. I asked for ketchup, a refill and extra napkins only to get them when I was finished my meal. (finished my meal as in another waiter took my plate and she still came with ketchup and napkins- hmm guess I need a spoon to eat my ketchup with now?)   I was literally furious at this point (not to mention the amount of times she walked passed our table with a blank look on her face)  Anyways, many times after that the experience was great.  Food: I was not crazy about the mac and cheese balls to be honest. Nothing about them stood out for me. The philly cheese steak is the only other thing I have tried on the menu besides the mac and cheese balls. IT IS AMAZING. The bread, the shredded steak, the fries and house salad- amazing. It is just a filler for my tummy and never disappoints.  If you are looking for delicious food (at any time of the time), but you are not in a hurry- go here."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. $4 Caesars, $4 beers, $3 mimosas. Disco Fries. Breakfast. What more could you ask for really? The Lakeview always serves its purpose. Delicious food, cheap drinks, good service. The decor is diner appropriate, nothing to write home about,  but endearing in a way!   The patio is great in the summer, and the large interior means you rarely have to wait for a table. And because 24 hour dining establishments aren't a plentiful in this city, I find myself here a lot...and always leave satisfied! Ch-ch-ch-check it out!"}
{"text":"For the first time possibly ever, I visited Lakeview at a reasonable hour instead of in the middle of the night. I think it might have been 7pm? I was toggling between about five different menu items but finally settled on the o' standard - premium grilled cheese sandwich (four cheeses!) and sweet potato fries. Total cheese overload but great for a once in a while indulgence.  I agree with Angela H that the menu paper had a revolting smell. I love the design of the menu - really, really pretty typeface and layout. It's almost a shame to soil it with your greasy hands.   Also, I was astounded to learn half price mixed drinks on Wednesdays - that means mojitos are like $5. Steal!"}
{"text":"Mac N Cheese balls here are so good! Deep fried balls of noodles and cheese. This place has great diner food. I always get the B.E.S.T. (Bacon, cheese, spinach, tomato) and add cornflake chicken. The fries are pretty good, just not loving the Caesar salad, it's often over dressed and too garlicky.   Our last visit here they made mistakes with two of our orders. This place is always jam packed and cray busy so I wasn't surprised  but they were great about compensating for their mistakes.  The atmosphere is great, it doesn't feel squished once you're inside and does have an authentic diner feel. Only downside- one ladies washroom stall = always a long wait.  The poutine here is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Tough to call this one. While I appreciate the heart strings the Lakeview has on its regulars, the fact remains my experience there was nothing above pat.  $4 caesars always help, but a foul smelling burger won't have me lining up again, but I'll take the blame for ordering that one during brunch (at 1pm no less)..."}
{"text":"Just your normal breakfast. Nothing to special to rave about, typical diner food. Strange...I had 5 mimosas and didn't feel boozy at all (and I'm a light weight) So I'm not really sure what was happening there. Watered down perhaps? I do recommend the Cesar, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm updating this review now as I've spent more time recently at my local haunt (long live The Lakeview) than usual, and it really is a 5 star establishment.   The drink specials are consistent the food is decent, but we really need to call out the servers. They are run ragged and are always fun, positive, quick and happy to serve you. Even when you're not at your best.   I've also recently taken to their breakfasts, and their omelettes are fabulous and go great with their maple breakfast sausages and $4 Caesars. Hooray.  There's nothing finer than eating in your diner..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best drunk food you can find in toronto. Only issue is it's cash only... at least they have an ATM though"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every dish is amazing. Any sandwich with spicy mayo is golden in my books. PLUS $4 pints own my heart. Whenever I'm craving some good ol' comfort diner food, this place fits the bill.   It is a bit of a hipster magnet, but it's Ossington and Dundas. What do you expect?  Also, open 24/7. WINNING!"}
{"text":"This place is open all day long has a variety of delicious divey/dinery food. I've only tried the Lakeview Benny (crab cakes Benedict) and the Turbo (with salmon and cappers), so I can't speak to everything on the menu but those two were awesome."}
{"text":"Perfect place for late night eats AND you get to continue drinking??!!  Count me in! We were a large group, and maybe a little rowdy, but our waiter was supremely nice and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm trying to remember why I was here... oh.. right.. afterparty food.  I am odd that I don't like to eat during or after drinking. So to be here after (too much) tequila, greasy food?? Nope not me. I know. I AM ODD I GET IT.  So everyone ordered some nice stuff: (this is from the Latenight menu) - The Standard $9.25: Two eggs any style with choice of Maple Sausage, Strip Bacon, Peameal Bacon or Grilled Portobello. - Le Plateau $14.50: Burger with Melted Havarti, Strip Bacon, Fried Egg + Fixings. Served with Classic Poutine - The Lakeview $13: Peameal, Melted Cheddar, Grilled Portobello, Onion Ring + Fixings  Greasy cheesy food right?? They LOVED every bite. Every single bite!   And you know what I ordered? I had the Fresh Cut Fries $4.25 (haha) plus House Gravy +$1.50 (hahahaha), and I ate ONE FRY out of this (hahahhahhhhahaha). I dipped it in the gravy (which was AMAZING by the way) and I was done.  I took it home.   Had it for lunch the next day.  Staff during this hour (Thursday 10pm) were so busy, the place was packed! It was hard to flag down a server. But they were very friendly and helpful. And fast (when they do notice you!)  Love the decor as well!!"}
{"text":"Went there after a night of drinking (Thursday) for some grub.  Service took a bit longer but probably because it was pretty busy.  Food was alright.  Standard diner fare but it definitely hit the spot.  Has a good old-school feel to the place."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was on a Tuesday night and I was looking to get shit faced on the cheap. I was also hosting some guests from out of town who would accompany me on this journey of shitfacedness. The Lakeview suited my demands quite nicely. It was rainy and cold but still the place was jammed.   I've had the breakfast here which I thought was pretty decent (but there are other options in the area) but what I like about The Lakeview are the cheap drinks and because they are a 24-hour diner. Their mimosas and caesars are solid for four bucks a pop and dangerous when you are sitting and socializing for extended periods. Getting up is the fun part..."}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfast I have had, the sausage, bacon, and pancakes where undercooked, I was thinking that when Guy Fieri ate here they must have paid him off, this place could be so much more, but you need to have decent cooks. I have worked in the food industry, and holding meats is a huge no no!!! Needless to say, I was here about 5 years ago, and it's still no good, it's just an old restaurant, and people who are nostalgic will go, but please either go to Fran's, or if you want a good bacon sandwich go to Rashers around the corner, both of those locations don't take short cuts to prepare a meal. Also the staff talking about travels gave me a bit of a headache, I understand if it is in regards to serving customers, or to the running of a restaurant, but the mundane conversation is just adding to the noise of the place. The best thing that I ate was the water, and that was curtesy of the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"YUM!!! The apple pie milkshake. and the food amazing. and place overall is quite simple place to grab a bite to eat and drink."}
