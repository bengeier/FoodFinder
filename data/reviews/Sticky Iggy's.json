{"text":"Soooo good. And my kids voted them best food truck ever!!! Sweet and savory! I was surprised at how much food you get for the price as well!!!  Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I love these guys. We hired Sticky Iggy to work a large brand activation at CES 2018 and they knocked it out of the park. Iggy worked with us to fully rebrand his truck for our client and worked with us to create a custom menu that coordinated with our client's product offering. They were so so easy to work with, Iggy made sure to keep us in the loop for many months leading up to CES and also helped us work out onsite logistics to insure his food truck could meet our menu offerings / attendees. The intense detail and high-quality offering - THESE WAFFLES ARE UNBELIEVABLE! - made the event exceed all expectations and we ended up breaking our goals thanks to Sticky Iggy! Such a PRO, such an excellent chef, so creative and all around just good good good people. Work with these guys if you can...and def find em so you can get at those waffles!!!!!!! Thanks, Iggy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and great service!  You can't go wrong with their signature Chicken N' Waffles. The fries are awesome, too. And they're quick - I've never had to wait too long at all.I always enjoy when Sticky Iggy's comes around!"}
{"text":"Chef Iggy takes chicken and waffles to a whole new,level. I just found hin at the food truck extravaganza,at on Fort Apache and Sunset that happens every Friday night from 5-11 trucks rotate. I had,chicken fingers dipped in waffle batter with ice cream drizzled with maple syrup. OMG those things should be illegal. They were amazing. If you like chicken and waffles you need to search out chef Iggy. You can find him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram"}

 I booked this truck for my daughters 13th bday and was not disappointed neither were her guest.
  You can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"So impressed! 2 chicken tenders & 1/2 a waffle for $5!! It's the Sticky 5 Special! Must try!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELISH!  I had their chicken and waffles and the chicken was cooked PERFECTLY - nice and crunchy breading and the waffles were awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Had there chicken and waffles today at the MGT event. That was some good eating. I would for sure recommend giving them a shot at your next party."}
{"text":"Holy crap, waffle battered fried chicken?!?!!? Okay, this food truck wins. 
      I'm not really one to eat vehicular based foods, but today was junk food lunch day and they were close by and it smelled so good and I was tricked!! 
      They were fast, my food was made to order and piping hot. The truck was clean, the girl who took my order was friendly and sweet. The man behind the fryer was friendly and nice. And my waffle chicken fingers and fries were SUPER GOOD. 
    Were they tasty? Yes. Do I regret eating them? Yes. Will I do it again? Yes, but it will be at a time when I can take a nap immediately afterwards. 

Waffle. Fried. Chicken. For. The. Win."}
{"text":"The food truck came to my workplace. I feel like they came unprepared. We waited in line for 15 - 20 minutes and still no one was there to take our orders. A few people just gave up and got cup of noodles from a vending machine instead. 

I really like chicken and waffles in general but their chicken and waffles are just okay. The butter is on the waffles so they got soggy pretty quick. The chicken was tender. It's definitely not worth waiting for 15-20 minutes plus to get the food. 

I would still prefer chicken and waffles from Skinny Fats to this place if I'm in vegas; otherwise, I would vote for roscoes in LA."}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my, oh my!  What's not to love about Sticky Iggys?  Hired Iggy to come to LVA, surprise my daughter for her birthday and feed the cast of the show she's rehearsing. 30 hungry teenagers!  Everyone raved about the food!  The burgers, waffle dipped chicken, fries...delicious, quick and big servings!  

Find this truck and eat up!!"}
{"text":"AWSOME FOOD!!! very clean and great service. Catered for our office, there was only one guy and he pumped out the food really fast!! 3 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I am a local wedding planner and had Sticky Iggy's truck at circus themed wedding here in Vegas. I cannot say enough good things. The guys were so accommodating to us. They adjusted the menu to fit this event perfectly. The food was amazing, the execution was awesome and price point incredibly fair! Thank you so much for everything you did! I look forward to working with you again in the future!!
