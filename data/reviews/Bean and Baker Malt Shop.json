{"text":"This place is awesome! I was so disappointed when Bickford Flexitarian closed and my expectations were high for Bean and Baker. Although the vibe is SUPER different, it's a welcome change! They can make everything on their menu vegan. I had the coconut ice cream float in homemade cherry cola (so good!) with coconut whipped cream on top. The decor, music and sharing a float made me feel like I was in a dream. So so so good."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff are so helpful and excited to talk about their menu. All their sweets are delicious and made in-house. Bickford Park is steps away so - sour cherry pie picnic in the park works :)"}
{"text":"The Bean & Baker looks like it popped out of the pages of an Archie comic, and the offerings are good enough to turn me into Jughead. It's great to have a reliable spot that's open before 11am near Bickford Park, and the coffee is respectable and inexpensive. The owners both work there, and can answer any of your questions about their retro menu.

The Wisey's Pies, old-fashion sodas, and butter tarts are all stellar, but definitely order a hand-blended malted milkshake first. I learned that malt is a nutritional supplement made from dried grain that was particularly popular during the Great Depression. I interpreted that as \"malted shakes are good for you.\" The malt adds a toasty depth of flavour to the shakes that makes them addictive. Try it with french vanilla ice cream so you can really appreciate the flavour. 

It's also worth mentioning that this spot has the friendliest staff I've encountered in Toronto. Between the owners, their staff of wholesome teenagers, and the menu, getting ice cream at the Bean & Baker will do a lot more for your seasonal affective disorder than a pint of HÃ¤agen-Dazs. 

The location has had a lot of turn over in the last four years, so my fingers are crossed that they make it through the winter and open a patio in the spring."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I've returned on multiple occasions and have always been impressed by the quality of the items I get.  Most of my visits have been for ice cream, milkshake or floats but I've recently started to sample the 'baker' items and I have really been blown away.   

Beef pot pie - Ahhmazing.  wonderfully rich and flakey crust surrounding what tastes like a rosemary and tomato filling.  Plenty of beef and didn't find any pieces with grizzle or fat.  

Chicken pot pie - Also Amazing.  Traditional pot pie flavour but the flavour somehow seems more intense than other pot pies.  I think there are additional seasonings.

Sausage roll - why is this soooo good?  The spicing is terrific and there are onions in it.  I think she might make her own sausage out of ground pork.

Turkey sandwich - A simple sandwich that was just made well and with care. Fresh bread, deli style turkey meat, toasted on the outside and served with 2 gherkins.  I may need to try another since my friend 'tasted' then ate most of it.  

Milk chocolate skor cookie - buttery sweet and delicious.  A perfect cookie.

Chocolate malted milkshake  - I've had this the most of anything (~8 times).  I'd recommend getting it in a traditional fountain glass (dine in) so you get the whole shake + the overflow.

Strawberry Hibiscus Float  - Yummy and so much fun.  A must try.

Chocolate egg cream - This chocolatey soda drink might not be for everyone but I happen to love them.  Their technique is very good.  They make them with a little more soda water than I would (I tend to use a little more milk) but this is consistent with how other places like the Brooklyn pharmacy make them.  This is a very fun drink to get here and I'd recommend trying it if you haven't had one before.

Ice cream cookie sandwich - Quite good, but you can have this anywhere.  If this will be your only visit I'd suggest going with something more unique to the place instead.  

ice cream cone - same comment as above

Ferrero Rocher Brownie - Not that into this one.  The base is good but the nutella, hazelnut and chocolate chunk top had a bit of an odd taste.

In conclusion,  you should go here.  Also, I want to marry Liezel who is an extremely gifted baker.  Too bad for me she is already married."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! 

Liezel makes the best desserts in the city hands down! Her lemon meringue pie is the best I have ever had with soft gooey meringue over a tart lemon filling. The smore's pie is another one of my favourite with a rich chocolatey filling over a graham cracker crust and these delicious puffs of marshmallow meringue on the top. Simply amazing!

The hand-made sodas here are all incredible too. What a difference it makes to taste real ingredients rather than the artificial stuff that most sodas are made from. 

Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Was in the 'hood and popped in for a chocolate malt milkshake after reading all the reviews. Amazing!! Best milkshake I've had in a long time and the staff are above and beyond friendly!! Would highly recommend. Next will have to try their delicious looking pastries"}
{"text":"Cool little spot easy to miss.
Had a rootbeer float, shake, and a butter tart
All of it was good

Float is made with all natural soda and the butter tart was so fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Root n Cola Float (Kawartha's French Vanilla)
Lemon Rickey Soda
Lemon Meringue
Smores Tart

So we just had a huge dinner and decided to come here for dessert.  Wish we had a smalller dinner because the desserts were absolutely delicious.  Lemon Meringue was light and fluffy, Smores was very rich (the wife had this I'm not much for chocolate)  The homemade sodas were surprisingly a very nice touch with the desserts.  I thought it might be a mistake and too heavy but I was glad I had it.

Best part - The Staff!!  INCREDIBLY friendly, patient, and just made us feel so comfortable! This is absolutely important to us as it often determines whether we would come back to a place.....and we will.....SOON!"}
{"text":"Lovely vintage decor. I had the soup and sandwich which were quite tasty and very reasonably priced. I will definitely be making this place a staple!"}
{"text":"Second time being there, love this shop sooooooo much! People are nice and friendly, serve you with a smile :)
They have one signature milkshake flavor changes every month or you can pick whatever ice cream flavors to make into milkshakes or sundaes.

I tried The Canuck milkshake - flavor of this month. Made of maple vanilla ice cream with butter tart filling and pie crust, top with caramel, whipped cream, mini butter tart and cherry. It's just right and not too sweet, personally don't like caramel but I did enjoy it."}
{"text":"A great little tribute to the quintessential '50s ice cream parlour. The malt shake was incredible. Will definitely return to try a sundae ... or perhaps the banana split for 4! A few more savoury options - even just fries - would be an added bonus."}
{"text":"Such a great experience :). 
The two ladies serving us were so pleasant and helpful. It was my first time being at the shop, and my boyfriends second. I ordered the cookies & cream vegan/dairy-free shake and it did not disappoint. It came won't all the fixings - whipped cream, chocolate sauce, cookie crumbs and a maraschino cherry. I had high hopes, and it was definitely one of the best shakes I've ever had. It was filling and light at the same time. Now, I can't speak for the dairy one, personally, but my boyfriend gave it a 11/10. The small size is more than enough!! I could have split it in half !"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and accents the neighborhood perfectly!  

I was waiting to get my emissions test at Guan's, just down the street, and wandered across this adorable milkshake shoppe.  It is conveniently located on a Harbord street corner with ample parking around. I met the owner/pastry chef and she mentioned that they had opened only two months ago. Both her and the other server were lovely. 

I love the decor... It channels a 'back in the day' kind of vibe and it is situated right across from Bickford park, so, perfect for a stroll afterwards.  

I bought a cherry pastry pocket, which might have been a mistake because it was so good, that it might be addictive. I'm impressed so far.  :)

I'm looking forward to coming back one night for a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Total hidden gem. Adorable shop set up and uniforms. We tried three different shakes, all amazing. But, the mint chip was definitely my favorite. All the baked good look amazing, and we had great customer service."}
{"text":"Bean & Baker could not be any cuter if it tried. It occupies the space that The Bickford Flexitarian used to be in, and they have done a wonderful job of making the space feel inviting. They have vegan options, including vegan whipped cream! The servings are enormous, the staff is a delight, and the atmosphere is A+. Go for the extra malt, you will not be disappointed. 

Extra lovely: The first time I visited, one of the people working came out and made a balloon animal (a dog!) for one of the kids in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little place! Delicious ice cream and shakes."}
{"text":"Perfect place for good old desserts, traditional style. 

New beautiful old school place on harbord street. 

Home made desert with natural flavor. Unbelievably good tasting butter tart and burnt marshmallow ice cream. 

Reasonable prices with no embellishment. 

Great service. 

Perfect for a date !"}
{"text":"To be honest, I can't rate the bean.

But, their hand poured sodas are absolutely fantastic, their in-house baked goods are great, (sweet and savory), and their ice cream (Kawartha Dairy I think) is well served.

On your next visit, ask for a mixed soda, it's not on the menu, but a lime ricky + orange is our current favourite."}
{"text":"I have always loved Bickford park and Grace street, with the houses raised on a slope. Walking through and by this community-oriented park gives me a really good feeling. Without knowing anything about Bean and Baker, I was narcissistically intrigued by the name as I walked by on opening day. I've been around for Linux cafe and Bickford Flexitarian at the southeast corner of the park and was curious to see what this new incarnation would hold...

There are checked floors, red chairs and red bow ties - you've entered the colourful parts of Pleasantville or the Wizard of Oz. I treated myself to a house made soda (flavour: hibiscus - $3) and was easily persuaded to try a baked good (a huge and rich bacon and pecan butter tart - WOW  $4.25). A lot of effort has gone into this shop and I am hoping that they do well. I think families would enjoy bringing their kids here. Remember how much you used to like places like Licks when you were younger?? This is even better because there isn't forced singing (mind you I wouldn't be opposed to the Beach Boys playing out of the speakers) and there IS artisanal flair and quality. 

The staff are noticeably enthusiastic and sincere and it's pretty adorable how they wear the classic hats and outfits. Everything is made in house except for the savoury New Zealand style pies from Wisey's and the ice cream from Ed's Reel scoop. Their sweet hand pies are apparently tasty, as well as cute and only 15 are baked each day. Get 'em while they're hot!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of the old Malt Shop in Yorkville, before it was demolished and turned into a condo. Since then... WHOA, over 15 years ago!  ...I have missed visiting a place to have a Malt or a float in Toronto in a venue that had that 50's Retro vibe. 

Now, the new and as far as I know, only Retro 50's malt shop in town is quite the location. Strong reds and a bright white accent can be found throughout the decor, not to mention the staff's uniforms and soda hats, it all has that cute kitsch factor. They do focus on drinks but have a few select pastries to pick and choose, although not many. 

During the Summer, Bickford park across the street is a wonderful place to go and sit if you want to avoid remaining indoors while a beautiful sunny day blasts outside. In fact, I used to do this very thing when I used to visit the previous 2 cafe joints that used to exist on this very location in the last 3 years.  

Now, the reason why I am bringing this up is because the B&B location is fairly removed from any major hub like the Annex to the north, Little Italy to the South and the Harbord Village near Spadina, and as such I can only imagine that outside locals, traffic would be in general, very slow. Which is something that perhaps is reflected in their prices. 

Since visiting in the past, I have noticed their prices slowly crawl their way up to the point that it is getting hard to justify, the trip, the limited goods, smallish space and the drinks themselves. Even when you take into consideration the friendly staff. 

I mean, $8 for a float? $7 for a malt? 
Come on. 

Even here in the Yelp photos of this establishment, another Yelper took photos of when floats where $5.25, that is around a 50%+ increase and the place has not even been open a year. Whether the pricing had not been finalized in the Summer or they discovered they are not selling enough, those prices will hurt their bottom line. 

Since most people will start to think of them less as something to have often, 'cause they are delicious, and think of them as something to have seldomly as a \"special treat.\" Again, hurting their bottom line, since really, the main reason most customers would come and what sets them apart is NOT their drip coffee. 

I am certain their overhead is higher than a regular coffee shop, the location they are now has been known for having higher than usual turnover possibly due to limited traffic and I doubt their locals will be buying $8 floats for their families on every visit. 

Although the B&B is cute, has that retro charm and the couple who owns it are very friendly... 
where they stand now, I do see them having issues in the future if they continue at those prices. 

I wish them the best."}
{"text":"So cute inside and the girl behind the counter was very friendly! The baked goods all looked delicious and the prices are pretty standard!

I actually went in and asked if they had apple cider, and they had it! It just was not on the menu! Made my day! 

I have it bookmarked to come back and try their shakes!"}
{"text":"Retro decor in a busy residential neighbourhood flushed with kids during baseball / soccer night. 

Interesting would be their made on premises pastries. Ice cream is just very average as it's just Kawarthas Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Fresh, light and savory crust for the win! Had a butter chicken pie. Because I enjoy punishing my metabolism. Fantastic service, cute ambience and delicious coffee. Will be going back as soon as I've worked off the abundant serving of perfectly crafted pie!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great empanadas and the warn cherry pie pockets ever.  But - those milkshakes?   I've never had one better!  This place rocks."}
{"text":"+Yay! They do terrific New Zealand meat pies and excellent coffe. Definitely going to support this local business."}
{"text":"Love the 50s diner look. Clean place. It's very family friendly with all kids getting their sugar fix like me. The staff was very friendly and courteous to bring my drink when I was sitting. I went around after dinner. The place is very busy since it's tucked in the neighbourhood outside 

I got a salted caramel truffle milkshake. I actually got the last pie and the last bit of ice cream for the milkshake so I consider myself lucky to get the populars. Friends got banana boar and strawberry milkshake. Apple pie pocket to share for the table. We all liked our drink. Rich and creamy. Loved the crust of the apple pie pocket. The flakes didn't fall apart and the apples were cooked well and it's  not saucy which I like. I'd definitely get the apple pocket pie again and maybe try a malt shake the next time."}
{"text":"One sip of their delicious chocolate malted shake and I thought: \"My mother would come back from the grave to drink one of these.\" Very surprised by how delicious and creamy it was."}
{"text":"The baked good are amazing. One of the best desserts I've had. The ice cream is amazing.

Saw a couple of kids in baseball uniforms eating the grilled cheese and they look perfect. And only $3.75.

The egg cream was awful though. I think the soda is the issue."}
{"text":"Love this place, great addition to the neighbourhood. Yummy Kawartha ice cream, amazing Wisey's pies (try the butter chicken), old-fashioned soda fountain. Would be nice if they had a few more savoury options!"}
{"text":"Best carrot cake I've ever eaten, hands down. Great spot with amazing coffee, shakes and desserts. Plus maybe the friendliest guy in all of Toronto, which is high praise. If you're anywhere close to here, do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Terrific service at this 50s vibe malt diner. The decor looks straight out of an Archie Comic book with staff uniforms to match. Service was attentive and they poured one order into two glasses since my friend and I were sharing a chocolate malt. Nice touch with extra whip cream and malt ball!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Had a root beer float and was delicious! Next time going to try a malt snake"}
{"text":"Pros: They make their own ice cream toppings, pies, tarts and seltzer, and have egg creams on the menu.
Cons: They don't make their own ice cream, and don't have wet walnuts or U-bet chocolate syrup for the egg cream.

Neighborhood spot w/ affordable sundaes w/ lots of topping options (except wet walnut). The people behind the counter are friendly and loaded my small sundae up w/ two scoops of ice cream (chocolate peanut butter and caramel kettle corn), whipped cream, chocolate and caramel drizzle, crushed malt balls, skor bits, homemade candied orange peel, coconut whipped cream (different from the first whipped cream), and maraschino cherries. According to my SO, her chocolate shake was really good."}
{"text":"Best Birthday Cake ever! The staff as super nice and always willing to help.  They made me an amazing Wonder Woman cake and it was delish!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at Bean and Baker today.  The staff was among the friendliest that I can recall and seem to take genuine pride in their shakes, floats, etc.  They were also very sweet with my little niece, making sure that she got the \"right\" color of straw, etc.  Everything was delicious and the decor is very cute."}
{"text":"Adorable vintage diner with amazing milkshakes made with Kawartha's ice cream. This place is intimate and fun and I love that it's mainly focused on desserts and milkshakes with occasional savoury options like grilled cheese and soup. 

Can't help but feel like I'm in some movie whenever I'm having a milkshake here"}
{"text":"This place was great! We were craving milkshakes and this place did not disappoint. I'm dairy-free and they had a bunch of options for me too! 

We started off with their savoury dairy-free curry veggie pockets which were really delicious, and perfect because we wanted to eat something before getting our dessert.

The milkshakes! Oh boy. Okay so they had pie flavoured milkshakes with tiny pies on top! My boyfriend got their Blueberry Pie Milkshake and was blown away! I had their dairy free strawberry shake and I thought I would have to forgo the whipped cream to make it dairy free; NOPE! They topped mine with coconut whipped cream, sprinkles and a cherry on top! It was the quintessential old school milkshake look that I wanted.

All in all I'd come back here in a heartbeat and am so glad we discovered it on a whim. The customer service is A+ but I mean how could you not be happy working here?"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Wish we lived closer so I can try all their flavors of in house soda! If we ever visit Toronto again I know we will be swinging by here."}
{"text":"I visited this place and had a malt. A vanilla malt. They made it extra malty because I like malt. I was very pleased with the extra malty vanilla malt. This place has nice people making nice things and this place would make you feel nostalgic for the 1950s if you're old. But I'm not that old so it just reminded me of what old people think about when they go to old places that are no longer around."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on the weekend. We thought we would try out a few old fashioned sodas and sit in the park and chat. 

The drink: we had the lemon Ricky, cherry cola, and a chocolate malt. All were really tasty and prepared right in front of you. 

The restaurant: SUPER clean and ultra retro decorations. The staff were insanely friendly and the fella at the counter chatted with my mom for several minutes about their food. 

The best part was about 20 minutes later the owner/manager (not sure) came down to the park with free pastries from the cafe and thanked us for visiting! Talk about customer service. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than Bean and Baker. The food, shakes and atmosphere are pure delight.  They make you feel young and fun, and are so very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for a snack when I had time to burn before an appointment. I didn't expect to experience an old fashioned diner. I had a chicken pocket that was pretty good, but I was eyeing the milkshake menu... I came back with my girlfriend and we each had a shake... To be honest, before Bean and Baker, I didn't think you could make an out of the ordinary milkshake, but Bean and Baker did just that. I don't want to ruin anyone's surprise, but I highly recommend trying one. Best milkshake in Toronto, and wonderful top-tier service both visits."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great shakes and floats, plus the coffee is good too! Coconut-based dairy-free options (3 ice cream choices and whipped cream) too."}
