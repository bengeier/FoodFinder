{"text":"We live on the lake and have been here a few times. The dock gets full but we have parked there once. Fish fry is good and their seasoned fries are tasty. The outdoor seating is a plus as halverson's is not on the water direction and Springers is. The bar is large and the bartenders are friendly too."}
{"text":"This is was my third visit to Springers in the last 9 months.  It is also my last visit.  What kills this place for me is the customer service or the lack thereof (with one exception at the end).      Bar service - While the drinks are always decent, the bartenders are neither cordial or inviting.  With as busy as they seem to be on a Friday night, I don't expect much, but one guy in particular always seems to have a chip on his shoulder and is a bit mouthy about it.  Every time I've been there I've been unlucky in having to deal with him.  The time spent at the bar is like being in purgatory with the knowledge that if I just bide my time I can move on to the dining room which is the light at the end of the tunnel.         Host/hostess/manager - On my last visit we were told a 45 minute wait to be seated in the dining room.  This wasn't a big deal because we expected it. Unfortunately 1.5 hours go by and we still hadn't been seated so we checked back in with the host/hostess.  One explained that everyone on the list with their name crossed off, including ours, was called/seated.  When it was obvious to them we hadn't been seated the other claimed our name was repeatedly called and we didn't come up.  The manager even got involved and she shared a similar I-don't-care attitude as the host/hostess.  At this point we felt hassled because not only did they not call our name but made it our fault.  A customer focused response would have been to simply apologize for the inconvenience and seat our party as soon as possible.  Maybe even throw in a free round of drinks to keep your customers happy.  Dining room/wait staff - I have always had good service in the dining room.   Food - The breaded and battered fish fry has always been really good.  It is what drew me back to Springers a second and third time.    In summary, Springers isn't someplace I would ever recommend nor will I ever go there again.  The negatives about this place far outweigh the positives in my opinion."}
{"text":"The service seemed a little slow but she was friendly. The fish tasted ok but I could tell that this was not made to order. The bottoms were separated from the fish and mushy when they came out.  We were here around 5:30 and it wasn't super busy.  Seemed as if they tried to get ahead for the night and cooked some before the order. The French fries were for sure ready to go before the order was up as they were warm at best when they came out and after one piece of fish, they were cold. Maybe an off night but would probably come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Bring your ear plugs and avoid the bar.   Worst old fashioned I have ever had.  Helen Keller could mix a better one...of which I had her deafness by the time I left because it was so dang noisy in the dining room.  Salad was good... bagged lettuce with a nice mix of vegetables on top.   Cold sugar -coated donut hole was an interesting accompaniment.   Blue cheese dressing and a donut hole...hmmm...sign me up for more.  Fish was great...hot and steamy...like a night I recently spend in Thailand.   Great view of the lake.   If you aren't into water...plenty of butt cheeks hanging out of the daisy dukes to enjoy amongst the wait staff.    My oldest had a cherry Pepsi and a hot dog...he left happy.  My youngest loved staring at the ceiling fan.  So...lake, fish, butt cheeks...three thumbs up.  Drinks, noise,  donuts...not so much."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have found delicious prime rib made right. Old fashions included. Never had bad service or a bad meal after many years of dining there. Love going there and definitely a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Tonight tried Springers for the first time. Good atmosphere.  Dining on deck lakefront was very popular.'  Baked fish very good.  Smelt very bad, the breading was thicker than to fish."}
{"text":"We've been going to Springer's for years and have loved the Friday fish fry.  Unfortunately, the past few times we have been very disappointed in the service and the food.  We don't mind the long wait for a table, but waiting another hour once we are seated for our food and then it comes to the table cold makes this one of the worst experiences we've had in a long time.  To top it off, there was another long wait for the bill.  Two and a half to three hours for a couple of pieces of fish?  I don't think so.  It's going to be a long time, if ever, before we make it back to Springer's."}
{"text":"As someone not from WI, recently wanted to try the whole fish fry experience. Although mileage-wise, Springers is not far from Madison, it doesn't take long before you feel like you're in a more rural area. We went for dinner on a Friday last month, and because it is next to the lake, I wish I could have seen what it looked like during day time. Although there were other fish fry options for us, Springers is on the casual side and has the room to accommodate larger groups. The wait wasn't terribly long, and even the hostess wanted to watch the end of one of the March Madness games.  I ordered the beer battered fish fry with a side of hash brown. While it was good and I would go again, there wasn't anything that stood out too much in particular. Service was friendly. Ample space for parking."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. Completely unprofessional. Came before an hour before they closed and made a scene when I asked for a drink. Will not be going again. That's for sure."}
{"text":"The view is amazing (no matter ehat time of year), the staff are friendly and the food is great.  I perfect lunch-hide-out!  Though it is kida hard to find, you'll be glad when you get there.  Nothing fancy, but certainly great!"}
{"text":"Could be four or five stars but for the service.  We have gone here many times but if they don't closely supervise the teenagers working for them  there are too many mishaps."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a beer and an appetizer.  Location is great, outside sitting was great, service was a little slow but very good and friendly.  The fried pickles were much nicer than expected.  Would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"This is a nice lakeside restaurant serving a variety of food.  We stayed in a Bed & Breakfast in Stoughton, WI and Springers was recommended as being a good place to dine.  I had the Tender Filet and it was well prepared and tasty,  My dining companion had a Top Sirloin and indicated that it was nicely done.  Both were served with a Baked potato and salads.  The portions of the main course are healthy and filling, but not so overwhelming as to make you stuffed.  The prices are reasonable for what you get and the service is fine.  When in the area, this is an excellent place to consider for dinner as it sits right on the water and you have good scenery to look at.  One caution - it is hard to find unless you know it is there.  However, if you are hungry and looking for a good meal, I think you will find it quite satisfactory."}
{"text":"Great place with fantastic service and food. It overlooks lake Kegonsa. The interior restaurant /bar is smoke free. They have a nice patio area where you can smoke outside. The food is wonderful, and you are served quickly. No complaints on this place. We will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Eating here as a vegetarian sucks. I know it's not a \"vegetarian restaurant\" but even McDonalds has better meatless options. Now they have sacked the Veggie burger (that was just a simple boca burger to begin with..but at least it was something.) If the Veggie Burger was returned, I'd at least give it 2-3 stars again. The sides with the meal are pretty boring but I do like the free appetizer type food that comes out."}
{"text":"Food was perfect and tasted fantastic. Hashbrowns with cheese and onion is the best side! The onions make It, nice caramelized onions, saut√© perfectly. Only down side was we didn't have a salt shaker to start but we to one."}
{"text":"We always like to come to Springers on Friday for their fish fry until a few weeks ago. We came to meet our friends and put our reservation in for four and went out to wait on the deck for our friends. The place was busy like it always is on a Friday and we were happy to have a drink and wait. When we went outside, there was one man band playing, it was good but very loud so we went to a table that was farther away and ordered drinks while waiting for our friends. When they arrived we had a drink and told the waitress we had reservations inside and asked if the fish fry was available outside and she said the fish fry was available, but it wouldn't include the salad bar or bread and that it came in a basket with fries or fry chips, no baked potatoes. So with those items not included we asked the waitress if it was cheaper, assuming the salad, rolls and potatoes were not included which she said of course.   So we all ordered a fish basket with fries and more drinks. When our dinner came the fries were under cooked and soft. The fish was good and the it starting raining hard so we had to run inside with our basket and eat standing up, which was not a problem. The problem was when we got our bill we were charged $12.95 for a soggy fry and fish basket, the same price of what you would pay inside, out of the rain with a salad, rolls and baked potato. We asked the waitress why she charged is the inside price and she had to check with other waitresses and said they are the same price.   We were very upset that she had lied to us before dinner where we could have waited for our reservations.   On our way out I couldn't leave without speaking to someone higher up on how we were wronged. And spoke with one lady who confirmed they were the same price and the the head lady who really said the same thing and was rude talking and having fun with staff during our conversation.   I think the customer service needs a refresher course on how to treat the guest who is spending $100 on dinner and drinks with their family and friends! An apology would have been a good start!   We will definitely be looking for a fish fry with a fair price for either a sit down dinner with a salad or a fish basket elsewhere.    Please..... Anyone heading to Springers for a Friday fish dinner please keep this in mind!"}
{"text":"Great possibilities but vy far the worst live music on earth... Food is good, venue a bit worn down, wait staff is aces, management is terrible."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some refreshing drinks and poppers with an order of mushrooms!  The poppers and mushrooms were great. Bar has a good choice of adult beverages!  Great place to just relax!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday evening and had a nice time. Four of us had very good meals.  Two prime rib dinners, one regular size and I had a queen size,  both were exclent. One perch dinner that had six large portions of fish with a lighter batter and also very good. One had a BLT also very good. Conclusion, just go there and you will have a nice time and leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for breakfast, my wife and I were both pleasantly surprised.  I had the prime rib and eggs which I thought was outstandinng for the price.  The decor in the dining area leaves something to be desired but it's a Wisconsin bar on the lake, so it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food is pretty rock solid with a notorious fish fry. Beyond that the service is mediocre at best and the drinks range from weak to horribly strong. Very little consistency and the overall bar atmosphere is rather boring due to the lack of customers and music. I would recommend this place if your in the are and look for an average meal."}
{"text":"Way way way better than I anticipated...very peaceful relaxing view of lake kegonsa..wait staff was friendly and efficient and the food was really good..I had a bacon cheeseburger with curly fries...the burger was cooked perfectly and the curly fries, were quite possibly the best I have ever had in my life, and I consider myself a curly fry connoisseur."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time finally and loved sitting outside right next to the water!  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  Had the nachos (made from homemade potato chips) and they were to die for!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Great burgers. Excellent house-made chips. Perfect summer lakeside patio dining. We'll be back to try the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Best. Views. Ever.  We love coming to Springers in the Summer, and eating on the shaded patio overlooking Lake Kegonsa.  Well behaved dogs are allowed on the patio, too! My dog sure enjoys it.  We both ordered grilled sandwiches, turkey with swiss; and hot ham and cheese. Both were large and nicely browned. Nothing to complain about here.  When given the choice between fries or fresh potato chips, we both sprang for the latter.  Just wished the chips had been more seasoned, at least with more salt?  Even though it was around 80 degrees at noon, it wasn't too hot on the patio due to a lovely lake breeze and sun shades.  If you need a GPS to get there, I suggest driving to Stoughton first---then set GPS. We didn't do this, and ran into trouble with hwy MN being closed   :(  Get out there and enjoy a lakeside lunch, people!! Dogs welcome!!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've been here, maybe 50 times over the years. It didn't always go by the same name, but the recent improvements have been great.   It's the local watering hole on this side of the lake. Lots of locals here and they will take a look at anyone that's new. The staff is always very friendly. They have pool, and some video games the last time I checked. The bar area is separate from the restaurant.   Food has always been good here. Great beer, drinks here, etc. prices are fair but do get expensive for some of the specials.   Overall, if you are on this side if the lake, stop on over and have a brew and burger, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Food was great and portions were huge!  I had a veggie burger, and my husband had a bacon cheeseburger with curly fries.  Service was underwhelming or I would have given 5 stars. Nice quaint place to eat by the water."}
