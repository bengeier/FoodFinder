{"text":"Nice and clean little Sports Bar located in the Delta Wing.  Nothing super special about this place just another airport bar with a few wines and a couple of beers and good selection of Sprits - Good people watching place that is super convenient to Delta Gates."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to relax after a long trip back home before going into the city or home great people and food everything about this place is good except you can only go hear in in the airport with a ticket change your policy so people can come and enjoy without flying"}
{"text":"Sorry.... airport food at the bottom end and overpriced. Uninspired burger. Fries edible not memorable and very limited selection of draft beer at a premium price.  and staff.... well... not rude but not overly welcoming. Got the sense they were working there to earn a paycheck that is all. Will hit McDonald's instead next time which is 50 feet away in the same concourse... that pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"I am in the Pittsburgh airport on average once a month. I typically don't have a lot of extra time to spare so I have never tried the Sportz bar before.   During this trip I had about and hour and half and decided to try it.  There are 2 locations in the airport;  one in B and another in D.  During late afternoon and evenings,  there is typically a fair amount of people.  I got a drink and the Pirates Melt (fried mahi mahi club sandwich) with fries.  The good:  the Mahi Mahi sandwich was actually very good and had better flavor than I expected.   The drink was good and had a decent shot in it.  The staff was friendly. The not so good:  the prices seemed high even considering it is in an airport.   If you're not sitting at the bar,  service can be a little slow.   The menu has a variety of options but not as many as other comparable restaurants in the airport.  I would go back but would make sure I had at least an hour to burn."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger and fries were good, but keep your credit card receipt.  I grabbed lunch with 2 coworkers while waiting on a flight.  Server initially brought 1 bill , but we asked for it to be divided.  She happily did and we all signed our tabs for our portion and headed to the gates. Problem started when I got my credit card bill and found they charged me the full ticket.  I checked with the others and they were charged only their portion.  I called several times and was told by Mike who identified himself as the Asst Mgr that he would check things and call me back.  No return call and then no answer when I called. I travel a lot and eat out all of the time.  First time I have ever had this happen.  Not a lot of money, but still not right."}
{"text":"Excellent airport spot with great service and really yummy food! Try the \"Steel Curtain\"- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere. If you turn your back to the concourse you can almost forget you're in an airport. Food smells great but I had already eaten. Had a Jack and coke double and it was still weak. Tried the Thunderhop beer and it was a decent IPA. Overall good feel to the bar. And I saw Evander Holyfield. Sweet."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in the Pittsburgh airport...   The burgers are great especially the pretzel bun burger and the homemade spicy ketchup is very good. Service is fast and on point!!!"}
{"text":"After an exhaustive day where I had no time to eat, I stumble by my gate and see my flight has been delayed. *sigh* Right next door was the Burgh Sports bar so I went in and grabbed a seat. Very quickly, a friendly waitress comes over, takes my drink order (just a Diet Coke) and gives me a menu. I'm tired and hungry and everything is a slight variation on the norm, which is not good when you aren't in an adventurous mood.   I love a good club sandwich; toast, bacon, lettuce, tomato. But wait! The Burgh Club has none of these in it. I ask the waitress for her recommendation and she pretty much recommended them all. So I got the Burgh Club with fries. It came very quickly.  Oh my gosh! I do believe it was perhaps the best sandwich I've ever had! The bread is done on the griddle in thick slices, perfectly crunchy. A lot of chicken sandwiches have a huge, tasteless chuck of chicken. Not this sandwich. The chicken was in perfect balance with the aioli and coleslaw. But the key was the breaded and fried pickles in the sandwich. The combination was simply perfect. And crispy fries done in peanut oil with a great seasoned salt...  The waitress said every sandwich there is like that. Unexpected goodness. While I hated my flight getting cancelled, The Burgh made it a bit more bearable."}
{"text":"Not the place for vegetarian diabetics. Service was thoughtful but my under-heated \"veggie burger\" (made with rice in it?) did not even have a decent flavour. And the salad was wilted. I've made this mistake before. Hopefully lesson has been learned."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in PIT, I'm going to order the smoked chipotle quesadilla again.  It was amazing.  Little bit of spice and a great flavor.  You must try it.  My wife had the omolet which was good.  The potatoes that came with it were amazing.  Gabrielle the bar tender was amazing."}
{"text":"The Steel Curtain is a hearty kielbasa on a pretzel roll. The fries aren't bad. Prices are competitive but not over the top like some restaurants found in various airports."}
{"text":"The honey Sriracha boneless wings here are amazing. I'm not normally a fan of Spicy food but these wings have changed my mind. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Great spot for a rest during travels."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here waiting for our flight. He ordered a beer and I ordered a sofa water. When our bill came, we were charged $2.75 for the glass of WATER. The waitress refused to remove it from our bill. Pathetic. I have never been to a bar where they charged for water. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Staff is nice, I had the buffalo boneless wings. It was chicken fingers with a sauce on it.  Not too good. Other than that fries were ok, drinks were fine.  Ok place to stop if waiting for a plane. Just don't eat the Buffalo wings."}
{"text":"Since my co-worker and I usually grab lunch before our flights home every week. We're starting to get tired of eating at TGI Fridays, Bar Symon and Quaker's Lube so we decided to give this a shot. Ehhhh.... it's aight. I ordered the \"Steel Curtin\" which I really think it's \"Curtain\" and someone just mispelled it ... but hey, I may be wrong. That doesn't happen very often :p. The \"Steel Curtin\" is a split Kielbasa sausage topped with two Pierogies in a pretzel bun. The pierogies were okay and the pretzel bun had a slight sour taste to it. I just ate the sausage and the cole slaw. This price tag was $12 -- I would recommend going to Bar Symon or Friday's over this place. Now we know and knowing is half the battle. ;)"}
{"text":"So there I was hungry and having time to kill before I had to head to my gate for the boarding call. Wherever should I eat?  I waked down the concourse and I decided to check out the Burgh Sportz Bar. I sat down at a table and a waitress came over to take my drink order. She had a great knowledge of what was on tap. She suggested that I try an IPA which I can't remember at this moment but I can say that the beer was quite refreshing.   I ordered the \"Pittsburgher\" medium well with a side of Coleslaw. The burger was a classic bacon cheeseburger from a pub but it really hit the spot. The cooks did a great job on the burger. The bacon was crisp and the sauce was out of this world.   The prices are relatively inexpensive and the orders are made quick which is great since a majority of their clientele are on time restraints when it comes to eating. You can get a good meal for under $15 which is often hard to do at an Airport.   The ambiance is a Sports bar at an airport. They had at least 6 tv's tuned to numerous sports channels. which featured either events or sports talk shows. The radio had a good mix of classic rock and top 40 hits however if you sit closer to the Airport side of the restaurant you can hear the Airport's \"Classical\" music.   I enjoyed my experience and I would definitely stop again! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I must start by saying I did not eat or drink anything at The Burgh.  We had an hour or so before our flight boarded to grab a bite to eat. The Burgh was closest to our gate. Although we usually try to avoid eating meals at the airport due to prices, we were starving. We sat at a table with another couple who was traveling with us, making a table of four. The place was busy, but not all of the tables were full. One of our tables had an empty beer glass and receipt from the previous patron. We were in plain line of sight of the bar. There seemed to be two servers working the tables, but also going back and forth from behind the bar. One of the servers went to the table next to ours to hand them their beers and shortly after food. She did not greet or acknowledge us at all, though she looked right at us. We figured she was busy, so waited patiently. After another 10 minutes or so, I stood up and approached the bar, grabbing a menu myself. One of the servers said, I'll be right with you.   Bottom line: we waited 5 more minutes or so, and when no one came, we got up and left. It doesn't seem anyone cared. Even if it was busy, there is no excuse for not at least greeting a party who has arrived. Service was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito, substituting chips instead of potatoes. I'm not sure why the food was all black & red instead of black & yellow, but no complaints on the taste! No skimping on the bacon. Chips were not out of a bag, but freshly made and still hot. Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this \"Sportz Bar\" in the Pittsburgh airport \"C\" Wing.  I wanted something on the lighter side before my flight to DC, so I stopped in for a beer and a quick bite.  The menu had some pleasant surprises on it.  I was really intrigued by the \"grilled tacos\" with roasted leeks, artichokes, salsa fresca and guacamole sour cream..  It turned out to be terrific! I decided against the grilled chicken add-on for $3.  It really wasn't necessary.  I got three loaded grilled tacos for $8.95.  They have a FULL bar for those needing a hard drink before their flight.  They had about 4-5 draft beers on tap including domestic and foreign selections and tons of bottled beer varieties.  The server was very polite and prompt.  Altogether my experience was pretty darn good.  Would gladly return for more of those deelish-us tacos."}
{"text":"We stopped here as part of a Yelp tasting event.  My boyfriend and I are chicken wing fans, so we were excited to sample the honey sriracha boneless wings. They were crunchy and flavorful and did not disappoint. The sauce was spicy in a warm way, not in a overbearing way. I could see them being a crowd-pleaser even for those who don't normally choose spicy foods!  The employee was very friendly and explained the wings to us. It may seem silly, but I was impressed that they made us feel special and gave us actual plates and large napkins with the samples because I was getting sick of eating in my hand! Haha.   The inside was clean, modern, and inviting. And how can you go wrong with a Burgh-themed bar??  I would come back again to try out more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes this is my fave in PIT. As far as food goes it was alright. It's new so I'm sure it'll take some time before the metaphorical dust settles.   FYI I'm gluten intolerant. If you wanna follow my reviews this is always the underlying question to answer \"Can I effing eat here without being a giant PITA?\"  Yes. Salads, nachos, and tacos appear to be gluten free. The BBQ chicken Strips are not. And I'm sure all the burgers can be prepared sans bun. (But aren't you tired of eating your burger naked like that?)  I was way impressed with the size of the salad. I was starving and I ate. I was full and could not finish it. My only complaint, well I have two, is the chipped chicken is really hard to eat because the pieces are so tiny and the stack the plate oddly. It goes (l-r) chicken, lettuce, vegetables. Trying to mix it and get the dressing blended makes a big mess. If the salad was mixed or the chicken was chopped/cubed, I wouldn't have mentioned it.   The other thing is there's no cheese on the salad. Not a mood killer, I jut really like the cheese. And really, don't all house salads come with a spot of cheese?  All in all this is a good place if you're in the B Terminal waiting on your plane. It's much less busy than the places up in the center area, but I'm sure this place gets busy with the \"happy hour\" or pre-flight gamers. (I am of the latter, pre-flight gamer type.)"}
{"text":"Next time I'm in PIT, I'm going to order the smoked chipotle quesadilla again.  It was amazing.  Little bit of spice and a great flavor.  You must try it.  My wife had the omolet which was good.  The potatoes that came with it were amazing.  Gabrielle the bar tender was amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my coworker for lunch.  Since we are often flying out of PIT we decided to try something new and The Burgh Sportz Bar fit that perfectly.  The inside of the restaurant is what you would expect from an airport restaurant with a large bar area and a dining area that was only slightly bigger.  To go with the burgh theme they had various Pittsburgh pro and and college pennants, pictures and memorabilia hanging on the walls.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the kielbasa and pierogies.  The menu said this consisted of 3 pierogies, kielbasa and braised red cabbage with sides of stone ground mustard, jalapeño sour cream and cole slaw and it came out exactly as described.  I first ate the pierogies which looked terrific with a nice golden coating to them.  The outside was nice and crispy while the inside was soft and tasty.  It also paired well with the jalepeno sour cream even if I didn't get as much jalepeno flavor/heat as I would have liked.  After finishing those I started in on the kielbasa which was on a bed of cabbage.  By itself the flavor was rather flat and not too great.  Thankfully the stone ground mustard had some terrific flavors which went well with the kielbasa.  Once I uncovered the cabbage I was able to try it and found it to be really bad.  Bad enough that I had no desire to eat it even though I normally love braised red cabbage.  Last but not least was the Cole slaw which also wasn't very good.  It wasn't as bad as the braised red cabbage but I wouldn't have eaten it if it hadn't been the only vegetables that came with my lunch.  The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't come back here again in the future.  While the service was friendly and the pierogies good both of my cabbage based sides were not that great tasting."}
{"text":"Descent beer list... good appetizers... and cheerful service... What else could someone want or need if in need of a beverage and snack before boarding their plane? I'm a fan and will definitely stop back in the future!"}
{"text":"Silly me I based my expectations for price off the airport's statement that prices are the same in the airport as outside the airport, WRONG.  For 7days no matter where we went , outside the city, the most we paid was $6 but average was $3-4.50  Airport $8 but for \"ONLY\" $3 more you get a double, little did I know a single was $8 .  I don't even pay that in the local SF bars and my singles look more like a double there.  Lastly a tall doesn't mean a double.  Note to self, drink more before you arrive at the airport.  Too pricy and sadly I don't even feel my two doubles."}
{"text":"Food is good fairly quick. I ordered the Pittsburgh with the side of Asparagus, but it came out with fries. Atmosphere is typical food place in airport. Service was ok, if it's packed go someplace else, I had to go to the bar to get a menu and see if someone would come to my table. Tip I would order the Pittsburgh but ask them not to put butter in the toast, it's a bit greasy."}
{"text":"I have walked passed this place for the past 3 years thinking it was just a phony tourist \"local bar\". Thought their food couldnt possibly be any good. Well I was completely surprised at how incredible the food was! I ate the boneless chicken with sweet siracha, and a hot dog and fries...the breaded chicken  tastes a lot like some good hooters chicken but better, and the hot dog was very similar to a steak and shake hotdog with a grilled bun. They both were super good! The food was made with someone who obviously cares about the quality of what is coming out of the kitchen as even the presentation was nice. I didnt care for the fries, but I am super picky about fries, and i am sure others will like them, (they kind of taste like oreida seasoned fries which i dont care for) I don't write many reviews, but this was so good that if you are looking for a place to eat while waiting for your flight, you will not be disappointed. The food here is very good."}
{"text":"a few interesting local (and not) draft beers (not your typical generic swill they usually have at airports. Very friendly and helpful staff. Haven't tried the food - wasn't that hungry; but they should expand their offerings and have some fries and other bar snacks (currently nothing of that sort on offer)"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang if one goes to the airport early.  Good beer offerings; did not try the food actually.  If one likes being at an airport early to avoid road congestion, this is a great stop."}
{"text":"Sports bar/restaurant in Pittsburgh airport.   Service was quick and good was great.   Ordered the Pittsburgher which comes with fried pickles, Cole saw, and French fries on tossted sourdough bread.   Also substituted the side of fries for asparagus for $2 more.  Meal was excellent and inexpensive!  Definitely coming back when time permits!"}
{"text":"The waitress was so nice, engaging, and helpful. I ordered a chicken club sandwich. It was very tasty and the fries were good. They didn't try to rush me out to get new customers in and let me sit at the bar a bit and read my book while I finished my food. Prices were very fair for airport food!"}
{"text":"Can't ask for much more at an airport bar.  Affordable menu. Friendly bartender.    Just wish they had larger tvs."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was ok-ish, price was just stupid.  1 piece of toast with my 3 egg omelet containing onions and the lowest price mushrooms you can get.  The onions turned and unfortunate black because of the low grade almost black mushrooms.  Looked pretty gross but tasted pretty good.  The other side, which was potatoes were 7 or 8 cubes of a potato to go with my 1 Slice of toast.  I've had beers here before and it's cool as a sports bar, but I'd go practically anywhere else for breakfast.  My waiter was real attentive and seemed to be on top of everything all the customers needed."}
{"text":"This place is called a sports bar and has six televisions showing, among other things, a dog show but no NCAA sweet sixteen. Boo hiss"}
{"text":"Andrea rocks!  I'm grew up in the Burgh but haven't been back for decades and she made my heart smile!  Killing me to leave but she made my last moments here all the better.  Great drinks, bountiful, delicious food... This is what Pittsburgh is all about.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped over here as one of our passport stops on the recent Yelp event. We were greeted warmly and got to sample some of their wings. If I recall correctly one was honey sriracha and the other one was more on the spicy side.  Both were very good! We really liked them! The staff made us feel welcome but time did not permit us to stay longer and learn more about them. The place did look nice and appears to be nothing more than your typical sports bar.  They have sit down service so it would be a great option if you want to relax, enjoy and meal and have a drink."}
{"text":"Da Burgh is da bomb!  Stopped at the B gates location while waiting for a flight out (they also have a location in the D gates) and had a great time.  I had a craving for an old-fashioned after having an amazing one at a restaurant downtown and the bartender wasn't that familiar with how to make one, but she said she'd give it a shot.  I thought that was super nice and it turned out okay.  Also, I'd just run the Pittsburgh Half Marathon so I wanted to reward myself with chicken wings and the boneless buffalo wings were super tasty.   Additionally, sitting at the bar, I met a ton of nice people from all over.  With great service, tasty food and a fun atmosphere, I'd consider flying back to Pittsburgh just to hang out at the Burgh Sportz Bar!"}
{"text":"Definitely would return. Leaving on an airline from a different terminal (A) and this is in D. Not a huge walking distance compared to O'Hare or Newark .  Very friendly staff. Talk and you will talk, stay quiet and privacy is respected. Get the quesadillas with everything. Don't expect a restaurant. It's not."}
{"text":"Good beer, good service. Extremely overpriced food. \"Kielbasa\" was slightly above quality of an Oscar Meyer hotdog. $12 entree was the size of a small appetizer"}
{"text":"I end up in the Pittsburgh airport a few times a year on business. It's never a great time due to having to drive for several hours before I even get to the airport and the the hassle of security.  Bur the Burgh gives me something to look forward to as I wait for the boarding call l. The beer on tap is already great and a nice mix. But the highlight for me is their  one less Buffalo wings. Crispy and light and spicy. They are just the best.   After a plate full of wings and a few beers, I'm in a much better mood and ready  for my flight. If you are stuck at Pittsburgh Airport, try out this place out!"}
