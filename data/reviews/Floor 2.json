{"text":"Soooo good! The service was amazing! Let Jarod pick your meal...he knocked it out of the park! Best meal we've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Just perfect.  Devon was our waiter and he helped us to select the perfect line up.  From the beef tartare small plate and battered anchovies on the salad, to the pork belly and sea bass, each bite was fantastic.  We shared 6-7 small - medium plates and were equally pleased with the portions and prices.  The service was top notch, engaging without being overbearing.  We will be back with friends to try some of the larger plates."}
{"text":"We went the night after Floor 2 opened and had such an amazing experience we didn't stop talking about it for days. We thought the decor and bar was incredible and were immediately impressed by the comfortable and elevated style of the dining room. We started with a round of cocktails and everything was delicious and unique - the Lunch With Joe was a major hit with our group. The refreshing taste of the prosecco combined with the smoky rosemary flavor was only complemented by the presentation. We then sampled a variety of the appetizers. Among our favorites were the mushrooms, scallops, squash, and a twist on the Pittsburgh classic pierogi. The chicken dish was mouth-watering and tender. Just when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, they brought our dessert - of course we couldn't turn down trying the white chocolate and berry Pavlova, rice pudding, and chocolate cake. Between the four of us, there wasn't a morsel left. Overall, a top notch dining experience in a place that is far from budget breaking! The menu has fresh, locally sourced food, an amazing hand picked wine selection, and cocktails that will have you coming back for all of your occasions! My new Pittsburgh favorite!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition.  I'm not going to waste characters comparing to it's horrible predecessor. Fl.2 is simply a gem. Top notch well-conceived cocktails, elegant space, happy and helpful staff, and the food.  I've only tried the burger - which was a decadent treat - the menu has plentiful listing of more elegant meals - but I went for the burger at the suggestion of the bartender - and it was ... unreal.  This takes kinda the crown from Chicago's Longman & Eagle or Owen& Engine for perfect hipster burger.    I'll be back.  A lot."}
{"text":"The new ambiance is really impressive and a job well-done.  The wine/cocktail menu is creative and interesting.   The food menu is a good start but needs to grow to accommodate a wider variety of tastes. In addition the food needs to be better described so you have a sense of what you're ordering.  As the restaurant works out their kinks, the obvious food delivery timing problems will work out - things like a 20 minute delay on one entree and a 25 minute delay on a side dish won't happen for too much longer I hope. The food itself was delicious and some of it was hot and perfect and served on time.  I wish the server had been a little more apologetic for the obvious problems. Overall there is hope that we will have another great restaurant on the scene prompting guests to return over and over. For now, as the server suggested, they need to work out their process as they are only a month old. They also need to realize that as the customers, we need to believe they're trying."}
{"text":"My first visit after it changed from Habitat to Floor 2. Since its in the same space it still overall feels the same but I am a fan, has an open kitchen you can see from the dining room. Service is still good, but a bit inconsistent; very quick service when I sat down and ordered, but went a good 15 minutes after receiving food with no one checking in on us. Main course (family size fish) and sides were delicious. Bread and butter is an extra $4, a little bit nit picky for an expensive restaurant to begin with. My $10 drink was almost all ice, so was not impressed with that, and the desserts were bland and very small portion size.   So a solid 4* in my book with the food being delicious and service being generally good. If you want a drink, just get a glass of wine; their cocktails are overpriced and watered down. And go get dessert at the MilkShake Factory a couple blocks down; much cheaper and you'll enjoy it much better. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was spectacular! (Dom, I think?) Try the almond croissant! Will be going back."}
{"text":"We went to fl. 2 last night with a party of 8. The ambiance and service was fantastic. The host greeted us immediately  and took us right to our table over looking the kitchen. Our server Katie was amazing. Three of our guests were running Alittle late so she took the time to thoroughly go over the menu and explain the courses to us.  The food came out rather quickly which was wonderful since we were very hungry. Once the rest of our guests arrived their orders were promptly taken and came out really quickly as well. We stayed to enjoy another drink and the desserts. The chocolate tart is fantastic. We also received the Japanese cheese cake for our friends birthday. We will definitely be back and hope we have the pleasure of Ms. Katie serving us again"}
{"text":"Fl2, in the lovely Fairmont Hotel was a great choice for Brunch before heading over to the Benedum to see a Sunday matinee of Waitress! Brunch started with a yummy Bloody Mary, followed by a delish version of Avocado Toast. Our server was pretty much perfect! The atmosphere has a great vibe. I would most certainly return as there was much left on the menu to try. Good friends, good food, and maybe you  will be lucky enough to score a seat by the window!"}
{"text":"First time having breakfast here and the best softest moist omelet I have ever had and I love omelets.  The fluffiness of the omelet was amazing. Spinach and ham dices were tucked in the middle. The bacon was thick large and chewy. Very large diced Potatoes will come along with it.  I was stuffed and I eat a lot for breakfast.  Definitely two thumbs up for this breakfast item.  Jesse was excellent in his service. Will have breakfast again here on my next stay."}
{"text":"Went to Fl.2 for lunch and shared a bunch of apps, entrees, and desserts, and so was able to get a good sense of the lunch menu/food.   Overall, a much better menu than habitat and better makeover to the restaurant, including the new bar, which is pretty Grand.  Here are the dishes I tried and the grades.  1. heirloom carrots. B+. Very solid appetizer. The sweet ricotta on the bottom made the dish. Wished the carrots were cooked more, as the server said they would be blistered (but they weren't). I would order it again.  2. Chickpea fricassee. B. My table mates liked this a lot more than me. I thought it was average. The tomato base kind of obscured garlic aioli.   3. Chicken and Brie tartine. B+. This was a fresh open faced sandwich, with argula and roasted chicken. Very large portion. My only complaint was I didn't get any real Brie taste in it-- would up the brie (and aioli) and decrease the amount of chicken. But overall, very solid.  4. Hamburger. A. Burger was great. Liked how it was on a sesame seed bun. I'm not sure, but I felt like they may have sous vide it, as it was really moist. The shoe string fries were terrific!   5. Steak frites. B. Good flavor to the steak, but was disappointed that there was no chimichurri sauce, as advertised. I guess they cook the steak in the sauce, but didn't really get that flavor from the dish. But an overall good steak, cooked properly. Same great fries.  6. Beignets. B. Just okay. I thought they didn't need the chocolate sauce in them, as there already was a honey sauce on the plate.   7. Babka. B-. Too dense for my taste. I'm not sure if a babka is supposed to be like that. But good  flavor.  8. Fruit tart. A+. I may be a sucker for a good tart, but it was terrific. Creamy lemony base, fresh raspberries, and perfect crust. Really nice dessert.  9. Coffee. A+. Not sure where they get their coffee, but it's first rate.   Service was a tad slow, but otherwise fine. Overall, a huge improvement over habitat and I would recommend giving it a shot. Will have to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"First time hotel guest at the Fairmont and since it was kind of late on a Monday I thought I'd give this highly rated place a try....  Unfortunately should have taken a walk.   Beautiful space- food was very good - pretty good size crowd. All off to a good start.   Now the not so good. Looks like there is one run ragged woman behind the bar serving the whole place. Everyone I talk to at the bar is asking what department I work for at PNC bank and isn't it great that we get 1/2 price drinks and free apps   Bottom Line- whoever is running this place might want to consider staffing properly for the headcount not the revenue because you're going to end up with a  bunch of guests at the finest hotel in Pittsburgh wondering how they ended up in a college bar inside. I'll wait half an hour to order wings and a draft colors light but wouldn't expect it at a place of this caliber.   BTW- the food was very good and the woman behind the bar did a fabulous job of making the most of a bad situation."}
{"text":"We just stopped in for the first time and it will not be our last. Abby was great and the other staff as well. We appreciated the attention to detail in the restaurant. Unfortunately we were only there for a drink but after looking at the menu we will certainly be back for dinner on our next trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Located inside the Fairmont Hotel downtown this place has a nice atmosphere for a special night out.  We went for Sunday brunch and it was very busy.  The menu has a lot of options and I went with my traditional eggs, toast, potatoes and sausage.  They would not let me substitute bacon for the sausage-chef does not allow substitutions which is annoying. The forgot my toast and I had to wait a while to get jam, ketchup and salt and pepper.  Others in my party got the romaine steak salad and were very disappointed although the presentation was spot on.  The breakfast sandwich served with a side of potatoes got rave reviews.  The brunch entrees are pricy are just ok for what you are paying for."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and found it to be the absolute best restaurant in Pittsburgh. My wife and I live here in town and have eaten at almost any place you can imagine, from hot dogs to foie gras, dive bars to exquisite dining and Floor 2 takes the prize. The place itself is beautiful, the staff is excellent, and the food is flat out amazing! HIGHLY recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for a private event, but also ordered from the bar and off of them menu during the event. When I first got there, I went to the bar to get a drink. It took 18 minutes for anyone to come over to me, no one gave me a menu or water. I actually had to borrow a menu from someone next to me at the bar, which is no big deal, but it seemed like the bartender was purposely ignoring anyone from the private event.   When the manager finally came over to take my order, someone I knew had shown up. Even though we told her we would be on separate checks, she put both drinks on my check anyways (more on this later).   We were seated for the private event, and I asked for a waiter so we could order off of the menu. Our waiter Don was amazing! This was the only good thing about Floor 2, in my opinion. He was helpful, friendly, and nice to us.   We ordered a simple green salad, that is supposed to include apple, arugula, and parmesan. What came was a plate of arugula, with little to no dressing or anything else. It tasted like arugula with water on it. We also ordered a cheese plate, this was good, no complaints there. Finally we got fries. They were cold, and there was nothing special about them anyway.  So, I go to close out with the waiter and he tells me that the bar will not let him transfer the tab and I have to go pay there, which is fine. I go to the bar, where I can hear the bartender now complaining about the people from the private event. He walks around me, not making eye contact and then finally says I will get to you in a minute. When he finally comes over I ask to close my tab and he tells me that both drinks are still on it, I tell him again that I only had one drink, and he gets the manager. They cancel out the ticket completely (from what I can tell), and then recharge me for my drink, which would be fine, but it is no longer happy hour, so my $5 beer rings up at $9, but at this point I am sick of the guys attitude, so I just pay and leave.   Really, this was a bad experience. I left having overpaid and went to get dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends. We parked over on the blvd of the allies in a parking garage and walked straight through market square. I wasn't sure what parking would be like but I'm glad I opted for $6 instead of the valet parking.  We ordered a few things to share off the menu...the cheese tray, simple green salad, french fries, and a few appetizers. Overall I thought the food was just okay. Maybe the entrees would have been more flavorful? The menu was quite pricey but I expect that downtown in a hotel. I tried two different drinks...the sangria and the cuvee brut champagne. The sangria tasted a bit watered down but man that champagne was tasty!!!  The restaurant/ hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many great places. Not sure I would come back for the food but they do have good happy hour drink specials."}
{"text":"We came here when visiting Pittsburgh because it came with a nice view. I'll be honest and say that the view is eh (just the streets of downtown Pittsburgh). But everything else was a treat. It had a classy, vibrant, yet modern feel with fantastic service and a lively ambiance. They say tapas style but I'd say the portions are pretty big compared to what I'm used to in DC.   My favorite dish of the night was surprisingly the chickpeas! They were perfectly cooked in a impressive savory tomato-balsamic herby sauce. The sauce had depth and kept us coming back for more.   The other dishes we got were mouth-watering also, from the ratatouille to the sea bass with a nice crispy skin to the pork belly."}
{"text":"I had the braised lamb. It was outstanding. We also had sides of brussel sprouts and roasted cauliflower. Both sides were good. I preferred the brussel sprouts.   Would recommend this site and definitely get the lamb!"}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with the food here. The appetizers were good but ordered the steak salad for dinner and it left much to be desired. It was all bitter lettuce with a few pieces of steak. Not the best."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch on a Saturday, lamb gyro. Lamb was a great choice. Excellent service, atmosphere and nmmenu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"While the bar and restaurant were truly a beautiful space the service really turned me off to this place.  Came for a private event which seemed unorganized and fl2 completely unprepared.  The bartenders were totally unwelcoming to our group.  The male bartender completely ignored us if we had a free drink ticket and even though it took 3 separate tries and a total of about 40 min I was able to finally get a drink from the female bartender- which if I'm being honest- was not worth the wait but it might've been the sour attitude that made it not so tasty.  It's not like I wouldn't have tipped but it was a real struggle and it seemed like they were actively trying to be rude by avoiding us so I didn't tip but I would've!  It was not a good look for them and made me not want to return.    While I appreciate the opportunity to check out a new place with the private event (co-hosted by floor 2) I really felt unwelcomed and more like we were a bother - I really don't know why they hosted if they didn't want us there.  Out of the 5 things we sampled I enjoyed the chick pea bite as well as the pork belly bite - although I don't think they're on the menu anyway but they should be because they were good.    I wish it was a better experience because I would love to support Floor 2"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.. Great location.. Great view...  Lots of potential for it to be an IT spot.. And service was friendly too.  BUT  Maybe it was just a...  One off...   However....  For us...  It...  Was.....     So.....    Gosh....   Darn...   S  L  O  W . . ."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this restaurant for my husband's birthday, and it did not disappoint! Though it's obvious from photos, the new design is absolutely stunning. Both the bar and main dining room are beautiful spaces and were full when we arrived, which added to the excitement. Our server Katie did a great job explaining the menu and making suggestions. We ordered oysters, chickpea fricassée, simple green salad, agnolotti and striploin. The oysters were very fresh and presented beautifully with fresh shaved horseradish and two homemade sauces. The fricassee was the surprising favorite of the evening - so flavorful and a great start to the meal! The agnolotti and striploin were also standouts. For dessert, we had the pleasure of sampling 3 dishes from the kitchen: the pavlova, japanese cheesecake and chocolate tart. Our favorites were the pavlova and cheesecake - both very unique and so yummy! I would absolutely recommend saving room for dessert. Despite it being quite a large meal, we left feeling satisfied but not stuffed. Loved how many of the dishes were vegetable-forward. Hope to come back soon for brunch!"}
{"text":"A gorgeous space with a very courteous staff! While the service was wonderful, the food was a bit lacking. Among our five, we ordered the Pupusa (2 thumbs up), the Breakfast Sandwich (great), an American Breakfast (standard) and two would-be grilled romaine steak salads. Given the recent romaine issues, the chef substituted what we were told would be a mix of spring mix and iceberg, but was more akin to bok choy or something similar. Unfortunately, the bitterness of the lettuce far outweighed any semblance of steak taste, though I'm not sure it was that much to speak of, unfortunately. This doesn't mean I won't try Floor 2 again - the space alone is worth the trip! But tread carefully on this particular \"Floor.\""}
{"text":"I had dinner at Floor 2 last week for my birthday and it was such a treat! We had reservations for 7:30pm and were seated right away. There were a few occupied tables in the bar area and people scattered around the bar, but the dining room was mostly empty.  It is, as other reviewers mentioned, an absolutely gorgeous space. The high ceilings and warm lighting give Fl2 a very upscale feel.  I adored the details such as the open kitchen with the hanging copper cookware and being able to see the chefs at work, and the fact that our table was set with mismatched place settings that somehow seemed to work perfectly together.  We ordered the tartare and a bottle of cab to start. The app came out fresh with thin, but crisp crackers and a whipped spread.  While I'm not typically a fan of tartare, this was good and was light enough to not fill us up, but curb our hunger and make us excited for dinner.  I decided on the sea bass entree which came over a type of stew - mussels, calamari and potatoes in a red base.  It was so flavorful and cooked to perfection.  My date ordered the lamb and totally loved it.  I tried a bite and it was smokey, tender and a little spicy.  Great flavors and an even better presentation.  As the evening went on, more tables were occupied and we got to see some other dishes come from the kitchen. I think if I came back, I'd try one of their salads because they looked so good!  We finished with the apple sherbet dessert and while I wasn't keen on dessert at first, it was incredible.  Definitely something to try if you get the chance to come here!  Our service was great and our waitress was very engaging.  She offered excellent recommendations and was extremely accommodating (asking if we were on a time constraint or had the evening to enjoy the food and atmosphere, etc).  Overall it was a flawless visit and I wouldn't change a single thing.  Absolutely recommend if you're looking for a nice experience in a beautiful setting with great food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Excellent brunch. Loved the avocado toast and cinnamon roll with duck. Tables are too close to others.... Aisle very crowded near kitchen area. You feel like someone will knock your food off your table. Noisy. But the food is the star."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and found out that they have great appetizers. I've heard good thing about the brunch menu. After trying out the appetizer, I think I will comeback for brunch or dinner. The atmosphere and music are great as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a post graduation brunch. Not at all bad. The highlight was actually the cocktail. The bartender knew her ish! She made me a perfect caipirinha with the right amount of sweetness and like. Perfect for that humid brunch time!  The graduate had a Smokey floral cocktail which was absolutely mind blowing, forgot the name. Having said that I Doubt you'll go wrong with the cocktails   For the food, nothing outside the ordinary for a brunch menu. I had the quiche in which the eggy custard was well seasoned. The crust was a little too overdone but not bad all in all! My buddy had the chicken crepes and I wish I had gotten those Bc the shredded chicken and aioli they served the flakey pockets in was just delightful.   Overall the winners in my opinion are the ambience (beautifully decorated and swanky) and the cocktails. The bar is pristine and the bartender was fantastic !  The food is good and won't be steered wrong but again nothing that crosses Barriers. If I was a hotel guest I would be more than thrilled to have this at my doorstep !"}
{"text":"Delicious food and revamped concept here! I had the striploin steak, which was prepared exactly to temperature. However, it was a little more broiled than grilled and I would've preferred more of a grilled taste. I also had the rice pudding dessert, which was great. It had a granola and brûléed citrus topping that really enhanced the taste and flavor. They were also running a $5 wine special and the wines were delicious!  We did have an issue with our service. We had a 6pm reservation in advance of a 7:30 show, which we communicated at the beginning. We were one of only a couple tables in the restaurant so it shouldn't have been an issue. There was some glitch with our dessert order and it came our very late so we ended up being late for our show."}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant in Pittsburgh! Good vibes. It's located near Benedum center and Heinz Hall, so it'd be nice to visit before the show. The servers were very nice, and food came out in timely manner. Drinks are on point. Food was good, but was not surprising."}
{"text":"This place it top notch and a great place to have coffee and dessert. Greg our waiter was amazing and so personable. The atmosphere is awesome with the open kitchen view. Highly suggest just to stop and get cocktails and a light dinner. Not very busy because people don't know it exists yet."}
{"text":"Floor 2, or fl2, to use the proper name, is the beautifully redone restaurant in the Fairmont hotel. The limited menu is hard to categorize, but I'd probably call it modern American. There's a raw bar, several small plates, a token salad, a few mains, and several optional sides. We shared the chickpea fricassee, which was enjoyable but could have used more ciabatta. We each had the lamb shanks. They were excellent. Our shared desert was the pavlova, but without the coconut. It's a nice light desert but not a great treat. Drinks were a glass of French Chardonnay and a bottle of Spanish merlot. The wine choices are limited and, as is the current fashion, creative, but very expensive and lacking traditional items like affordable California Chardonnays. fl2 is a good special occasion spot, but not for the meat and potatoes crowd. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cocktail after work. Great selection of liquor. Love the Art Deco feel and decor. We cashed out, laid our cards down, and then signed the receipt and walked out. Surprise we're given the room receipt as if we were guest and then chased down like we were \"dining and dashing\". The hostess said it happens all the time - either she was trying to make us feel ok which wasn't necessary or it really does and they should be more diligent."}
{"text":"It was my first time in this space since it was changed from Habitat. The space looked really nice and the bar looked really cool; I would have insisted on sitting there if I wasnt going for lunch. Our server was nice and helpful. She came to check after each course to make sure all of our needs were met. My friend and I started with the Heirloom Carrots, which were really good paired with the ricotta and greens. I got the grilled romaine, however because of the E. coli scare with romaine, they had a different green and it wasn't as good as it could have been. Something less bitter would have been preferred BUT it's better than getting E. coli so I'm still happy. The horseradish/blue cheese sauce was really good too; the flank steak was cooked well but had a few pieces that were just fat. My friend got the bib salad with salmon and really liked it. We're really excited to go back and overall enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"I had business colleagues in from San Francisco who were staying at the hotel. The renovation of the restaurant was impressive ; hence, I thought the food and service would have also improved. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Our server started off exceedingly attentive, but then we didn't really see him after the appetizers were served to us. Additionally, I waited 40 minutes for my drink and was told there was only one bartender. That's no excuse ; they should hire another bartender. I hope they correct these problems or they'll fall prey to the same demise that the former restaurant, Habitat, did."}
{"text":"Fl. 2 is second to none in the downtown Pittsburgh brunch market.  It is clean, offers a contemporary ambiance, and most importantly--delicious food at an affordable price.   I had the chicken meatballs and my fiancé had the avocado toast.  Both were large portions, delicious, and reasonably priced.    Compared to Or the Whale and Meat and Potatoes, Fl. 2 wins every day of the week (and especially on Saturday and Sunday)."}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp event. The location is great. It's located downtown In the Fairmont Hotel on the second floor. The decor reflects it's pricing. For Pittsburgh, I would still say it's somewhat pricey. The ingredients are local and so are the recipes. We had a special sample appetizer menu so I can't speak to the quality of the overall menu but what I had was delicious. We had ox tail and pork shoulder.   Again, I didn't order off of the menu but I would recommend giving it a try based on what I sampled."}
{"text":"Super Underwhelming restaurant.  None of us enjoyed our food. Very overpriced . Drinks were fare. Do not order the burger... sea bass, scallops or pork belly . Will not return. The  onion soup was awful. There was no flavor to it whatsoever . Very disappointed. My boyfriends sister in law ordered a burger and fries, and I mean cmon it's not that hard to screw this up but it was Awful ."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. My wife and I had 5 \"to share\" plates.  My order of preference; Pork Belly (a must have), wild mushrooms, Brussel sprouts with bacon, Sea Bass with calamari and mussels and Octopus. All entrees were very good although the octopus wasn't the most tender I've had. The cocktails are creative and delicious. Nice ambiance and exceptional service. Our tab with tip was ~$150 which felt about right for the quality of the experience."}
{"text":"My waiter has forgotten about me. No refill on my beer. He brought the dessert menu and then deserted me. I had the steak salad. It needed some seasoning. It was pretty bland. I have seen others make similar comments on other items. They'll have to step it up. There are too many good places to eat downtown."}
{"text":"The food here is a solid four. Our service, while friendly, was legitimately abysmal. We started the evening while standing at the host desk for several minutes while a hotel guest, who seemed to be flirting with him,  asked the host dozens of questions about the place - the host noticed us but at no point made an effort to acknowledge us or say he'd be with us in a moment. Another staff member came up, saw us waiting, and also ignored us. Seated, our server took our drink orders, then came back, said our drinks would be right up, and wanted to take our orders. We had a few questions and wanted to confer, so we asked her to come back. She came back ten minutes later, still not bringing us our drinks, and said she was ready to take our order. Again, we inquired about our drinks, and she again said they would be right up. We ordered, and she headed to the POS to put in our order - still no drinks. Finally got our cocktails (VERY GOOD)  about 20 minutes after were were seated and were left no time to enjoy them because our apps were dropped soon after. Tartare and winter vegetables, both very good. No serving utensils were offered. I find this really odd for a restaurant that emphasizes sharing. We scraped the food off of the share plates with our forks. Our server returned and we asked her for a wine list. When we had questions about the wine she had to ask the manager to come over, and we were grateful that he did because he was not only helpful, he also cleared our empty dirty plates the server had neglected when she dropped the wine list. He brought our wine out right away and our entree course soon followed. Mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The broccoli rabe we ordered never made it to the table. Our shared entree was the trout. Again, we were offered no serving utensils. Tell me how you would divide up a whole fish with a butter knife. After taking a shot at it, we flagged down our server and got two spoons and a sharp knife. The food was delicious but the trout was really difficult to portion out because the skin was tough (but tasty) and hacking away at it was frustrating. The server came by to ask us how we liked it and we mentioned we would not order the trout again. She came back and said that her manager would like to buy us dessert (very nice) since we were unhappy with the fish. She cleared our plates, and then brushed off the table on to the carpet WITH HER BARE HAND, smearing mashed potato across it. She brought our dessert settings, set them on top of the smear of potato, then realized that was kind of gross, I guess, got a rag, picked up our flatware, wiped the table, and set the flatware back down.   I didn't like my dessert choice (sounded better on the menu than it tasted), but my husband had the chocolate tart and liked it.  The manager stopped over and we mentioned that our server was really very nice but needed some training to have the polish the place seems like it is trying to achieve. I hope they make it because the food is really good and that manager was working his butt off!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best meals I've had in my life! I had a few friends come in from Las Vegas who work in the food industry there and they were really excited to see what Pittsburgh had to offer. The idea to go to dinner was pretty last minute so a lot of well known places were booked up. Luckily, on Open Table I saw a reservation for Floor 2 open that night.   The first thing you'll notice is that the place is beautiful. You feel like you are in a Mad Men episode and nothing you are wearing is cool enough. Everything is shareable which is the way everything in life should be. We ordered so many good things. Some of my favorites would be the chickpea fricassee and the agnolotti. The pasta was perfectly cooked  and delicate. Plus, anything with brown butter is beautiful. The food was impeccable, the vibe was amazing and the service was fantastic.. Out of close to 10 dishes, there wasn't a single miss. I can't wait to keep going back to this place and eating everything possible!"}
{"text":"Had a very delicious meal there. The waiter just ordered us several dishes off the newly constructed menu. Excellent flavors and presentation. I can truly say these guys care about great food and service. I will Be back"}
{"text":"Gorgeous spot to grab a drink. I love me a specialty cocktail and had a hard time choosing one. My husband got the Kai rise and I went with  Lunch with Joe - just next time i would skip the smoked rosemary (just didn't appreciate that type of scent/taste) and the chickpea fricassée. The chickpeas were rich and creamy and the bread was delicious. The bartender and server were really nice and had great suggestions while we were going over the menu. Can't wait to come back and try other cocktails or maybe brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I highly suggest allowing the waiter to customize a meal for you. Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner and absolutely loved this place! The atmosphere and attention to detail is impeccable in all aspects of this restaurant.  We let our waiter choose our meal with a little guidance on our part and he did a fantastic job. Every plate was unique and delicious.  The wine list is special and curated really nicely. The staff is super knowledgeable and can guide you to the perfect wine and food for your mood.  We are looking forward to coming again very soon!"}
{"text":"Exceptional.  I went as a group to fl 2, and I just had a great time all the way through. The restaurant is located on the second floor (yeah you guessed it) of a hotel, and the hotel+restaurant aesthetic is just amazing. Fl 2 is super modern, clean, and so open. The bar has one of the most beautiful displays I've ever seen, and overall, the space is just overwhelming in polish.  My waiter was super cool, and was very attentive with our table. As for the food, wow for the selection. They have all the favorites, from salad to steak, and even vegetarian favorites (ratatouille!) and fun seafood options like mussel. If you come with a group, you'll definitely be able to experience the amazing array of food options.  I had a table full of food, but some highlights were the chickpeas, which if you like a tangy, sour feel, is very fun. The ratatouille was amazing, which coming from a meat lover, means a lot. The veggies weren't sliced thin like they do in the movie, but they were baked well and the sauce was just so wholesome and comforting to eat. As for the other entrees I chose, I wasn't too impressed by them. The 28 oz ribeye had high expectations, and I thought that the meat just wasn't seasoned fully and seared well enough. The meat quality was good, but the texture was a bit tight and it wasn't too savory chewing through the meat. The sea bass was alright, but the jumbalaya choice for the soup was a mistake in my opinion. Mixing in calamari, mussles, and even potatos (???) into a tomato soup was quite a weird combination with the bass, and I wasn't too happy with that.  Overall, the presentation and atmosphere really makes this place a must if you happen to be downtown in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. The bar was wide open.  Service was great. Prices were reasonable. Got the french omelette and a side of seaside tomatoes. Esposito got the breakfast sandwich and the stuffed french toast. We enjoyed this."}
{"text":"Lovely! I stopped in on a chilly morning a few days before Christmas and had a simply delightful breakfast experience.   The space is bright and airy with big windows that look out toward Market Square and downtown (especially cool with all of the holiday lights that are up right now).  The staff -- from the hostess, to the lady who walked me to my table, to the waitress -- were gregarious and full of smiles (always a good thing when you're not quite ready to \"morning\"). The coffee was strong and piping hot and my breakfast -- avocado toast with poached eggs and cherry tomatoes -- was just wonderful. The bread that all this was served on was dense and flavorful (not sure its origin, but really good and hearty) and the eggs were *perfectly* poached.   In all, a terrific breakfast experience and I'll be back soon to check out the dinner offerings!"}
{"text":"That was some boring badly spiced food.   Let's start with the good - the bar and restaurant are lovely, good ambience. The mocktail made for me was very delicious. Our server was great. My date liked the octopus.  But as a vegetarian, I was disappointed in my meal of small plates. The brussel sprouts were drowing in salt and lemon (they ended up comping us for them, so maybe I shouldn't complain). The cauliflower had a great texture, but was essentially flavorless. The chickpea fricassee was some chickpeas in a bowl with a thin watery sauce and two slices of bread with tomato. I like bread, so I ate a slice of that, but I could barely choke down the chickpeas."}
{"text":"Great place and great change from the old Habitat restaurant.   I had the lamb which was very good with the bone marrow cut so you can eat it.    My wife had the mussels and my 8 year old had one of the better burgers he has had.     Chef Julio came out and talked to us and really takes pride in his work.    We got the rice pudding for dessert which was lite and refreshing with a orange flavor."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the food was great as well. Instant favorite. They had a very creative and tasty take on French toast. Ordered a second to take home."}
{"text":"1 word....Amazing! From beginning to end it was an incredible experience! Some of the best food and service in Pittsburgh. Highly recommend trying the bone in ribeye, fries, and ratatouille! They also have an exceptional raw bar!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so wonderfully decorated. It so clean and fresh looking, very inviting. The bar area is also beautiful with comfortable seating around the bar. I love all the windows and the ability to be able to look out over town while sitting at the tables. I shared only a few items off their menu. The simple green salad was very good, perfect amount of dressing. Their shoestring fries had a good taste to them. I actually put them in my salad and that was delicious, not really the restaurants ' style though haha. They are fancy in their presentation and price. I also had some of the fromage and charcuterie and the cheese was really good along with the mustard and honey comb."}
{"text":"Shared the Octopus and Sea Bass and it was excellent!   Beautiful little bar/restaurant.  Definitely cant wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The atmosphere was modern and cozy. Highly recommend to anyone in Pittsburgh. We WILL BE coming back. The waiter picked our courses, and we were NOT disappointed. Go to Floor 2!!!"}
{"text":"Bougie done badly.  (Over-wrought, over-thought, not very good cocktails. Over-priced, too trendy wine list. Did not try the food, unimpressed with the dessert menu.)"}
{"text":"Bar and restaurant really redesigned to take advantage of the 2nd floor location with plenty of windows surrounding it. Had appetizers and drinks at the bar. Flatbread with carmelized onions was delicious. Great creative menu with lots of locally-sourced ingredients."}
{"text":"Floor 2 is beautiful! The interior itself is worth coming to see. I had brunch here recently with friends. Was surprised to see how empty they were during Sunday brunch hours. A few of my friends got a juice off their great juice menu. I got the \"Lunch with Joe\": prosecco, lemon juice, elderflower, smoked rosemary. I don't think I'd ever had a drink like that before. It was definitely very, very smokey, and overall pretty good.   For my entree, I had the lamb gyro, which I thought was disappointing. The lamb tasted really bland to me and I only ate about half of it. The portion size was large though! The gyro came with a generous serving of fries, which made me happy. They were very simple and good.   Our server was very friendly and conversational.   Taste | 3.5-4 Atmosphere | 5 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 4 OVERALL | 3.5-4"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Sunday brunch and when we arrived, we waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated, as the hostess was nowhere to be found. It was not at all crowded and several bartenders stood there and did nothing to acknowledge us or get someone to sat us until we spoke up. When we finally were seated, the table was dirty. We asked the hostess if someone could wipe the table. The hostess got someone, who told us that the table was clean and just stained and then proceeded to demonstrate this by wiping a mark which came clean. When we pointed out that the mess came up, she said it was a stain and walked away. How do you not only refuse to wipe a table, but try to show how it's stained, then upon learning it's not stained, you walk away?! SO RUDE and SO GROSS.   The actual service from our server was really great! He made sure that we had everything we needed and check on us often. He was the best part of our visit, as the food was lackluster and bland.   I don't think we will be back, and I would urge others to not waste their time and money."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Saturday. When you walk in, the grand bar is the first thing you see. The dining room has an open kitchen and a wall with the Pittsburgh skyline. We both started off with the zero proof cocktails. I had the berry smash, which was raspberry, blueberry, mint, lemon, and soda. The drink was beautiful and delicious. It was sweet but refreshing as well. My friend had the clean and green, which was very light and cleansing.   For brunch, I had the poached eggs, which was oxtail jam, spinach, gougere, and hollandaise. Wow, this was definitely one of my favorite versions of eggs benedict in the city. The hollandaise was heavenly and the gougere was a nice change from a traditional english muffin. My friend had the avocado toast and enjoyed her meal. She had just wished hers maybe came with a side. Overall, an excellent place to grab brunch. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is that our server forgot about us. Once we got our food, he never came to check on us, refill our water, or even give our check. I had to ask another waiter to get him to get our check."}
{"text":"Floor 2 has replaced the Habitat in the Fairmont hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. I met up here with some friends and got an opportunity to sample some of their offerings.  Among the things I tried were ratatouille, Brussels sprouts, charcuterie and cheese board, flatbread pizza, French fries, and some pita bread. I was very pleased with these foods and must give a thumbs up on most of these items. The portion sizes of these plates were generous so I was able to share them with the people I was with.  This restaurant is pricey since it is located in an upscale hotel so expect to pay above average prices. The restaurant has a full bar and it gets very noisy in here that it is difficult to maintain a conversation. It is very decoratively arranged with both tables near the bar area and some in the main dining room.  I was glad I had the opportunity to dine here. Located on the 2nd floor of the Fairmont hotel in downtown Pittsburgh it is an easy walk to Point State Park or if you are headed to the Clemente Bridge to PNC park. The hotel has their own indoor parking as well."}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised how great my lunch was here! Not because I was judging them based on the former restaurant here, Habitat (okay, maybe a little), but because I came for lunch. I am never very excited about lunch. I love breakfast and dinner. Lunch is usually boring!  It was not boring here, I'm happy to report! I had a delicious rotisserie chicken salad. It was on a bed of bitter greens, but the honey dijon dressing really balanced everything out. It was also complemented by a generous sprinkling of pomegranate and apple slices.   Service was friendly and the ambiance is modern, yet warm. I like the updates they made because it seems sleeker and fits in well with the hotel. I'm excited to try dinner there now!  Celiac/Gluten Free review: They were super accommodating when I told them I had celiac disease. They don't have a GF menu, but they can accommodate dietary requests, which is nice (they said they don't even have peanuts in the kitchen because of allergies). I'm happy to report I did not get sick, so no cross contamination concerns and I'd feel comfortable coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day. Great place. Really nice presentation. Good value $75 4 course meal for the holiday. Drinks were on point. Fine dining (technically new American?, I have no idea) establishment and food was delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had been excited to try this place for a few months but our visit was very underwhelming.  Overall, I would probably give the food 3 stars but our server diminished the experience substantially.  Coming off as a very self-aggrandizing expert, he insisted on continually making recommendations for items we didn't want to order and said he was known for \"picking meals for the diner\" on his own.  Most of his recommendations were for the higher priced menu items.  When I ordered the burger, he recommended the steak which was approximately twice the price.  When we asked if there were dinner specials, he said the only \"special\" was the different serving styles of the various waitstaff.  Our party of 4 tried to humor this strange fellow but by the time our entrees arrived, we were sick of his act.  On another note, the roast chicken and oysters were delicious. All of the other items were decent or unmemorable.  The Brussels sprouts tasted identical to what I make at home.  I'm a good cook but still, you expect something better at a classy place.  For the high price of this restaurant, we expected much better. We dined at Spork the same weekend and every element of that meal blew Fl. 2 out of the water."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, thanks to yelp I found it located in the Fairmont hotel next to Market Square.  We went around 2 on Saturday afternoon, and were greeted soon as we walked into the hotel, then took the elevator to the second floor.  To our surprise there was a 20 minute wait even though there were several tables open.  So we opted to sit in the bar area. The bartender was fantastic, seeing I was very pregnant she offered to make me a mock-tail. Which was so delicious and refreshing to have someone go out of there way to make my visit nicer. Then we placed our orders and my husband got the Short Rib burger and I got the pasta. We also ordered the french onion soup, and to our surprise it came without the typical melted cheese, but instead had bread stuffed with melted cheese on the side.  The Pasta was homemade and looked like a smaller serving but quickly filled me up.  My husband loved his burger and you could actually see and taste the short rib.   This was a great experience and our bartender made it even better. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. Love the denim apron outfit the waitstaff wears. Highlights: scallop crudo, octopus, broccoli rabe. Can't wait to come back."}
