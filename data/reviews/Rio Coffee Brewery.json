{"text":"Been going to the drive up/eat in coffee shop since it opened a few years ago. The prices are a little high but the quality is exceptional! A member of the staff explained to me they only grind enough beans for the day then dump the rest. Fresh beans are ground everyday! They always have weekly and seasonal specialty drinks...some are common some are unique. Staff is more then happy to suggest their favorites. 
As for the food...bakery is always fresh and looks homemade. The chicken salad is amazing!!!
Service is friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"Coffee here is decent and I would recommend only for that. I got the smokin' chicken sandwich or whatever it was called and to my dismay the chicken was Tyson, ready grilled, fake ass, chicken. I realize many places do this, however, I also got a fiber bar which was explained to me as being home-made. This was after she told me how she disliked packaged fiber bars because of all the bullshit that's put into them. So my question is why are you then serving fake-ass ready made chicken?? It's not hard to make a chicken breast and you can pre-cook them and freeze them so I don't buy the convenience argument. Take some pride in your establishment and make REAL food. It's hell of a lot easier to make a chicken breast than a fiber bar from scratch. 

I may come back for coffee but I'm leaning towards boycotting on principal. Staff is friendly and service is quick so no knocks for that. If you're going to open up a place and serve good drinks and baked goods, don't half ass it, especially on some chicken breasts. 

Just to clarify how easy it is to make chicken breast, here is my recipe: 

-season with s&p 
-oil in pan, doesn't matter what kind in this case because anything is better than the bullshit chicken you're serving.
-sear chicken both sides until brown
-throw in the oven at 350 to 400 for 30 to 45 mins. - you may need to actually do some work to dial in the temp and times.
-if convenience is an issue make them ahead and freeze them, again frozen real chicken is better than fake Tyson bullshit. 

p.s. there was bacon on that sandwich too and I think it was also pre-made horse dick but cannot be certain because there was so little on the sandwich. 

Sorry Rio, you're coffee is good (the fiber bar wasn't bad either) but don't cut corners; it's lazy and insults your customers' intelligence.  That said, if Rio uses real food it could easily earn 3.5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This cafe certainly does not deserve 4 stars !  The omelette was very disappointing. A slice of processed cheese and deli ham is not my idea of a fluffy omelette. The smoothie was so sweet I couldn't drink it. That can't be healthy. And the hash browns looked like the frozen kind you put In a toaster. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Good coffee,outstanding apple muffins . Easy drive through service and friendly staff. Free dog treats at the drive through"}
{"text":"Amazing little caf√©. Has everything you would expect from the larger franchises, with a cozier feel. Could not ask for more! Plus, happy hour after 3 pm?!"}
{"text":"First off, the OMELETTES. They are so good! I'm personally a ham and cheese fan (as a huge fan of cheese by itself), and so I highly recommend them. They are packed with deliciousness, instead of those typical bargain omelettes in which you have to swim through oodles of egg to even reach a bit of ham. 

The coffee is another notable favorite, I'm pretty sure it's why most people go here, understandably. If you are one of those people that wants to support the local place vs. the consumerist international chain, then this coffee shop can hold its own against Starbucks. 

However, as stated in earlier reviews, the staff is rather rude. Honestly, this is my only hang-up for Rio. Other than that, it is a very cost-effective place to go for breakfast on-the-go."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and great staff. Skip that Starbucks line, support the local shop and enjoy a great cup of joe. 

Food wise - the Greek yogurt parfait is really good as well as their panini's. They have a drive through which is convenient if you're on the go. If you're ordering food make sure you call ahead, the food is made from scratch not prepackaged like Dunkin."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, friendly staff, great food!  I have been going here since I moved to Avon lake a few years ago."}
{"text":"Out of towner here who did not expect to find such a cute independent coffee shop in Avon.  Coffee was tasty and the staff was very nice.  The restaurant itself has a very comfortable feel.  There is a bookshelf full of books to read and hidden in a corner were a number of board games, which would be great for a rainy day.

Coffee was above average but not great.  Certainly better than Starbucks.  Didn't get to try the food but the menu looked promising.  Also interesting that a local coffee place has a drive through.  I guess bonus points for people who don't like to get out of their car."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop. Cute, locally owned and with a drive thru, I would expect something like this in Ohio City or River, maybe-- but not Avon Lake! I buy all my delicious whole bean coffee here! Friendly staff. Perfect."}
{"text":"First visit, so will edit if I go back. Coffee was really good and wait staff very friendly. Ordered a western omelette which was a Weight Watcher 9 pt. Meal. It came with canned mushrooms (yuck) and a crazy amount of cheese with what appeared to be two eggs. The frozen patty fried hash Brown really turned me off after they sold me on ordering the 12 grain bread. 

The egg salad was really cold, too sweet with overload of relish and in need of a salt. 

Not impressed except for the nice seating and free WiFi, which I did not stay long enough to try. Expensive breakfast and left hungry. Might give it a second try, but not impressed."}
{"text":"I will stop by for the occasional drive through latte, but we ventured there once to eat on a weekend and the service was SUPER slow and all 3 of the staff members looked like they wanted to slit their wrists. There were no smiles, no courtesy to the customers and it felt very awkward while there. I'll continue to get drive through drinks, but won't venture there to eat breakfast again."}
{"text":"I always stop here anytime I'm working in the area. The breakfast menu is awesome and always made to order. The coffee is da bomb and the workers are always quick and pretty nice. The price isn't that expensive. Btw the breakfast menu is all day! They also have a convenient drive thru. Can't go wrong with rio."}
{"text":"Such a great find!  We had to grab a quick breakfast and the sandwiches were great, coffee and pastries delicious.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Avon Lake and was thrilled to find a local coffee/sandwich shop just 2 streets away from my new house.  My first visit in, I ordered the Turkey Grinder.  It took about 10 minutes to get the sandwich, so I was really expecting something delicious. I was very disappointed. It was so generic; plain bread, unseasoned, and standard cheese slices.  For $7.00, I felt totally ripped off. 

A few weeks later, I decided to give them another shot, so I ordered the Italian Panini.  Two words:  absolutely horrible!  I took 1 bite and the sandwich completely feel apart from the excessive amount of cream cheese.  No lie, my hands were drenched.  The meat was chewy and gross.  Needless to say, I threw it out immediately.  At $8.00, it's a total joke. 

I'm officially putting a fork in Rio. Hopefully they can bring some new items to the table in the future.  Until then, you can find me at the Subway across the lot."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, the owners work there everyday. A true small business. Perfect little place in a great small town. It may sound silly but I love the tuna sandwich. And for breakfast we always get the bacon-egg-cheese bagel. They make it right every time. Prices are higher than you'd expect but definitely reasonable for the quality and service. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area and looking for a nice little quiet lunch."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  Large beverage menu for a place this size.  And some interesting flavored coffees.  The day I was there the Flavor was Coconut Cream.  My latte was good, not great.  But the coffee cake cinnamon muffin (incidentally that was as large as my head) was delicious.  Hit up the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Service is slow during lunch, but the food is delicious. Their coffees are on par with Starbucks."}
{"text":"Rio treats us like a family and our dog loves the attention he gets in the drive through!"}
{"text":"I have totally begun a love affair with this Avon Lake gem. I drive twenty minutes from Westlake (usually the scenic route) on all my work from home days to grab a iced vanilla latte made with skim, its fabulous and not too bitter.

Rio is situated out front in the Drug Mart parking lot, in front of Kenilworth and a Subway on Walker Road. Best part? They have a drive-thru. But, be careful that you don't enter the drive-thru going the wrong way! I definitely almost made that mistake my first visit.

On most of my trips to Rio, I've gone inside to order. I just like the atmosphere. The staff is welcoming and friendly and I've never felt that overly pretentious vibe you can get at some other independently owned coffee shops. Rio just keeps it real.

Rio carries lots of whole coffee beans for purchase including some Rainforest Caramel Crunch, Hawaiian Coconut Cream, and some delicious Kona Blend, among others. They also offer a selection of Torani syrups and various other Rio swag (coffee cups, travel mugs, etc.).

The sunlit patio (see pictures) is a great place to sip an iced brew on a warm day. Inside you will find a quaint seating area with comfy chairs and tables, with shelves stacked high with random books and board games for your entertainment pleasure. Rio also has free WIFI in case you're trying to get some work done while fueling up on some caffeine.

Let me also mention you enter Rio from the front of the building which happens to face Walker, which confused me at first - but what else is new. At least there's a sign that directs you to the door - so I must not be the only one that has felt this way. Every time I enter Rio I really feel like I'm finding something unique and special. Its definitely a great locally owned place.

Rio carries a TON of food options. And like Cara has said it does seem a bit Sysco-y, but! they make up for it with the care they put into preparing it for you. The boyfriend and I have gotten breakfast to go more than once and our selections have been super tasty (a bacon egg and cheese croissant and a sausage egg and cheese wheat bagel). Rio's pastry selection could be a bit better... it makes me sad that they don't appear to bake on location like some other coffee shops do (hello, Arabica of North Ridgeville). Most of Rios pastries (muffins, danishes, lemon loaf) look like they came from Costco.

A fab thing about Rio is that the website and menus inside the shop include approximated Weight Watchers points. I love the effort they put into serving health conscious fare.

All in all I cannot pass up my iced vanilla latte on any trip. It's not bitter, it doesn't make me overly jittery, and it isn't overly sweet - its the right mix of everything I want my morning brew to be. If you live close, or are up for a nice little ride out to Avon Lake, check them out!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly and overpriced.

I love to try new coffee shops so when I saw it I had to stop by! There was no customers when I stopped by and I got terrible service. Guy was rude and unfriendly. Not very willing to help me find a coffee I wanted and didn't want to take time to make me food from the menu. Charged me over $9 for a 16oz iced coffee and half a sandwich. When I asked how it came to that priced he said the iced coffee was $3.59 plus each shot of flavored syrup was 99¬¢ so because I wanted white choc and English toffee it was $2 more, so I paid over $5 for a small iced coffee with a little flavor and it didn't even taste that good! Plus a $4 HALF sandwich! Very disappointed. I should've just went to the nearest Starbucks. 

The one star can be for the sandwich, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have always gone to the pull up window (a plus in itself). I love supporting local coffee shops, they always seem to do something differently. This is no exception, they have a huge menu with a lot of food and fun coffee drinks. The service is great and as an added bonus, they have little dog treats for my pups when they are in the car with me. Great place to stop if you are over Starbucks or panera and want to support a local business."}
{"text":"Very good chocolate and caramel iced mocha. It was about $5 which is more then Starbucks. Other then the price the drink was delicious. I went thru the drive thru and the barista was extremely friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Nice place, comfortable. Local. Very friendly. Great food selection, it was busy. 

They have coffee. No pourovers."}
{"text":"Raven's review pretty much says it all. Very good. My husband is usually the one to say everything is just \"average\", but he said he really enjoyed his chicken bacon wrap. I have had the chicken pesto wrap and the light turkey sandwich before and I really enjoyed them both. A lot of times I hate eating out due to thinking about all the calories I'm consuming, but I can eat there with no worries!They try to make a lot of their items \"weight watcher\" friendly and include the Weight watchers point values...which is a plus for me :) Oh and the coffee is really good too!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced breakfast and coffee. I frequent here often; it's much better than Starbucks! Go Local"}
{"text":"Really love this local coffee shop! It's my go to place in Avon Lake.   Coffee is great- lots of beans to choose from!  Great breakfast sandwiches, too.  Not to mention, a very comfy seating area with both tables/ chairs and a couch.   There's a wall of books, with a take one, leave one theme.  

It's a great spot to meet up with a friend over a coffee, to sit and work, or catch up on your reading.  Really encourage everyone to check it out and support local!  The owner is a really nice guy!"}
{"text":"I feel like I cannot fairly review this place without a return trip, but I'm sure I'll be back. 

I stopped in here to do some work last week while the bf ran some errands. It has all the amenities that you're looking for in a coffee shop-working place: free, fast wifi and caffeinated bevs. 

What, you need more? 

Jason had no complaints about his latte and I was happy as a clam, surfing the net for work purposes. The outdoor patio was huge and didn't look too shabby. 

I saw a few people grabbing some lunch, but nothing really stood out to me, presentation wise. It all looked sort of generic and Sysco-y. This observation could be totally wrong, though, considering I didn't actually eat anything here. 

Either way, I'm sure I'll be back here if only for the fast wifi and to properly finish my review."}
{"text":"All day breakfast sandwiches! Delicious coffee and a drive thru! Great place for a lighter, fresher lunch and coffee! A little bit expensive for what it was, but not outrageous. Cute indoor and outdoor seating areas, although I could see it getting crowded. Was not crowded at 1:00."}
{"text":"I love this place! The omelette's are amazing! And the Ruben is my favorite thing to eat there, I get it every time. I love how this place is so modern, yet so cozy. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great drive thru (and sit down) breakfast spot.  Love their wraps"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here, thanks Yelp! The coffee was incredible, so were the omelettes and we finished with the amazing New York Cheesecake (and we're from NY!)  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you're not paying attention, you can easily miss this gem. Their cold brew iced coffee was very good but more expensive than the national chain competitor. They did, however, offer better sugar free flavor options. I also got a turkey guacamole wrap, which was nothing special. Since it is local, I don't mind spending a little extra. Everyone who worked here was pretty friendly and kind. I liked enjoying my coffee and wrap on the patio they have. I kid didn't love spending 12 bucks on one iced coffee and a semi decent wrap!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it's semi local to where my wife and I live and it's not a starbucks.  My wife got a mixed drink with coconut of some sort that she liked, which again starbucks doesn't carry so she was happy.   They had a few choices of coffee brews for the day, and I just had a black coffee.  I liked it, but I couldn't tell you what kind and it wasn't burnt. All for a fair price, couldn't ask for more.  I would come back, there was a fine amount of seating, with tables reserved for people who want to come and eat lunch.  Lots of board games and books for those that want to kill some time with some friends.  Also, I probably won't use it but there's a drive through, which can be frightening if you're sitting by the window as some people really can't drive."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee beans and nice staff, also love the amounts of choices and flavors available for drinks"}
{"text":"I love Rio Coffee! Their daily flavored coffee is as good as I've ever had anywhere. They offer a great variety and their prices are fantastic. The staff is very friendly and quick to offer suggestions. They have a nice extensive menu with many different choices - including low-fat options. They also deliver! My only complaint? They don't offer Dave's Homemade Chili year round. Rio = my favorite coffee joint!"}
{"text":"For a drive thru breakfast- very good.  Had ham & cheese omellete.  Capucchino very good"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches and good service at right price. I had hot chicken wrap sandwich and loved it. Coffee is fresh and place is clean and welcoming. Great to have lunch or breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Small and reasonably priced, but I found the staff rude.  I personally do not care Starbucks style coffees.  Rio's has a wide variety of coffee, so asked for mild coffee like Maxwell house or Folgers.  This didn't sit well with the cashier who went on to tell me that they only serve \"Good\" coffe.  I don't need a hassle...all I need is a cop of coffe.  I won't be back."}
