{"text":"I really dig the peeps here(been visiting for almost a year) but today just rubbed me the wrong way. When I first started going here they offered $5 shakes with the option of a tea for an addl $2. Sometimes I would get the tea but not always since it's a bit much while I'm working. Fast forward some months and I go in and I'm forced to get them both for $8 which again I wouldn't mind doing sometimes but not all the time. Now let's talk about today, I go in and wow the place has been transformed into a space with a dope Cali vibe and I'm impressed! I start chopping it up with my normal peeps while I'm marking off my choices for(tea and shake) and once my they are done and I ask how much(thinking it's the same $8) I'm told that it's $11, what the heck! I paid the money since my drinks were already made but the old me wanted to get in my vehicle and drive off! Why wouldn't I be told that the price has increased when I have been a regular for so long? It was deceitful and wrong and I can't see myself returning, I will just go back to my smoothies which contain more than powder and water."}
{"text":"Really neat option.   Its more of a powder, get the drink you really want vs the ice cream ones like Pulp.  I really like the concept and will be back"}
{"text":"The shakes and teas are awesome and the staff was super helpful! The only reason I'm posting is because I'm confused by review about pricing. Our total for a tea and a shake was $16. $8 each.  From looking at different reviews of both this location and their sister location people have been charged anywhere from $11, $14, to $16. super aesthetically pleasing inside with lots of white space maybe add your pricing to the wall/ order form to be consistent. Skittles tea was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! They sell health smoothies with really awesome flavors! Try the Banana Caramel! By far my favorite. Everyone is also very friendly!"}
