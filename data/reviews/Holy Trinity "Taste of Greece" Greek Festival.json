{"text":"I absolutely love this festival. I've been coming here for the last 5 years. The food is great. The desserts are homemade. The baklava is so yummy and they have this dessert which has filo pastry on the bottom and custard on top. That is why I keep coming back. There's music and dancing and they have Greek dinners as well as gyros and they serve alcohol too. I highly recommend never missing this summer food festival."}
{"text":"This festival is amazing. First off, everyone is SUPER friendly. There are long lines but you don't even notice because they move so fast. The food is amazing, totally legit. Best Greek food i've ever had. The souvlaki, souzoukaki, and pastitsio are ridiculously good. Outside they have gyros lines, amazing.  Try one 'yinzer' style with fries."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite food festivals in the summer. I've gone two years in a row now and I am looking forward to many more years! The event is so well organized, and even though the lines are long, they are set up very well and move fast. The food is SO GOOD, and that really is an understatement! I could eat this all day every day for the time period it is going on. Also the prices are amazing for the amount and quality of food you get.

They have the food separate into either inside the church or in a few tents. Before you walk in they have maps that point you to where everything is and also the menu for each location. This year they even had pictures of what each dish looked like, so you could decide before you made it up to get your food.

I wish they had a call in ordering option but I am sure in time they may get this. Also they do sure beer and wine! SO along with your tasty food, you can have a drink!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, my lamb was cold. Plus overpriced, $25 for a meal. I've had better and it's unfortunate that Pittsburgh doesn't have any decent Greek restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this festival for several years now. A couple of things to note: 1. the food here is as Greek as it gets 2. The food is quite amazing 3. It's a very reasonable price 4. The people from the church are amazing and fun 5. The event is extremely well organized with a band, dancers, tents with items for sale, and an amazing Greek culture atmosphere! 

Would highly recommend dropping in to try authentic Greek food from great people. It's a great way to spend an evening! Mark this festival on the calendar for next year!"}
