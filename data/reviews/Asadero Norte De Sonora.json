{"text":"My son told me about this place. Said the the food was excellent and the tacos were a WOW!!.  We were out together and decided to have lunch there and to our surprise they are closed on Weds.

A  few weeks later I was in the area stopped in to have lunch. The tacos were amazing and everything else that came with the meal.

I stopped in again yesterday and the food was great..

It's worth the drive and you will NOT be disappointed and the prices are good.

I don't write a lot of reviews, but the time to do this is well worth it.

Try it once, you will come back for more.

{"text":"Based on reviews I thought the food would be excellent both in flavor and quality. We had carne asada tacos and there was almost no flavor at all. Plus, two of the tacos had big pieces of gristle that were unedible."}
{"text":"Amazing, I'm not even a meat eater and this place was great. Had a bean burrito. The frijoles were great. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food, all the way around. This is the kind of place you expect to have paper towels on your table, and you do, and you'll need them and love that you do. I lived in DC for a few years and there were a lot of pollo a la brasa joints all around there that I became addicted to, and miss.  This is very close in flavor, if a different cultural tone. Totally recommend this for an inexpensive, delicious, and low-maintenance meal with close friends.  Knowing basic Spanish is probably helpful."}
{"text":"The best Mexican I've had, and now that I'm in Seattle, what I miss most.  I just can't believe Chipotle has so many people stand in line for their burritos a short distance away when this authentic joint usually has a table open.  Enjoy, for my sake!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems hiding in plain sight.  The food is star of this place and for good reason - it's delish.  They prepare their meats over mesquite charcoal which imparts a deep, rich flavor.  I love the carne asada caramello chico.  Basically a quesadilla but so much more at the same time. Imagine hot off the grill carne asada sandwiched between queso blanco and two freshly made flour tortillas slathered with their home salsa...yum!!! My friend loves their pollo asada burrito - it's huge and packed with flavor in every bite.  The location will no doubt turn some people away but if you do make it through the door you won't be disappointed.  In fact, it's one of those places that should be featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Awesome food that is budget friendly."}
{"text":"It would of have been nicer if they would open the windows or have outside tables almost cooked my eyeballs out because of the smoke also they took for ever to give us our food."}
{"text":"Driving by I never would have stopped here. However the reviews were good so I tried not to judge this book by its cover.

The bean small soup they give was very good. Tacos were soso I've had way better. 

Although service was good, I'd have to pass on a return trip because it wasn't very clean. The outside of the building is a pretty good indicator of what you'll find inside."}
{"text":"Great food, two of us shared the 1/2 paradilla made up of carne asada, barbacoa and al pastor. Yummy. Came with 7 tortillas and definately more than enough for 2 people.
Barbacoa was tender and juicy and flavorful and so was the al pastor. Carne asada wasnt' as nice as the barbacoa but still great. 
Horchata was creamy and nice but wasn't the best one in Phoenix but the barbacoa was definately the star of the lunch."}
{"text":"sum of the best tasting and smelling chicken, A+ in service and food,could feed a whole family for $20 will be back for sure.....Parking is a little iffy and place gets packed quick......"}
{"text":"Pros - This place is so good! We always get the platter with 3 meats.
           The ribs are so delicious too, they are my favorite thing on the menu!

Cons - They have only one salsa, which isn't that good and you come out smelling               like burn from all the smoke in the air."}
{"text":"The lady's who work her act like they don't get paid. They are so rude the food is amazing but there attitudes are so rude will never return and will tell al my friends to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was our go to weekly taco joint when i worked downtown. I miss going there! One of my old coworkers nicknamed the place Valuetown. Literally got two full tacos, chips, salsa, guac, bean soup for $4!  or 3 for like 6$  It was so cheap! and so good. 
Super authentic, family run. little divey mexi place. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran food!  Carne Asada, tortillas, chicken, beans, etc were all bomb!  My wife and I are picky when it comes to authentic Mexican food and have wanted to try this place for a while. Well worth the drive for us and we will be back."}
{"text":"I was born in San Luis RC, Sonora. You can't be born more up north in Sonora than that. I lived 30 minutes form my hometown across in the USA for about 32 years total, so when I say that this is EXACTLY how a taqueria in Sonora smells and tastes, you know I'm telling you the truth.
Before I tried them my favorite taqueria in Phoenix was Asadero el Toro, followed by Tacos Chiwas, but it will be a while until I return to those two, because Asadero Norte de Sonora just has that hometown taste and feel. The only thing missing was the taste of charcoal on the carne asada, it tastes cleaner than the San Luis carne asada, but sometimes you just miss that charcoal taste, still, thats nothing that should deter you from eating here every time you want tacos. The beans are great, the cabeza, pastor and asada tacos are also great. GO HERE! GO HERE NOW!!!

OH BTW, the jamoncillo at the check out was so creamy and sweet, it was perfect as well."}
{"text":"Smell is amazing at the parking lot!! Though don't expect luxury parking (very small). Lunch was great looking forward to seeing what else is great!!!"}
{"text":"Best food Everrrrrr  great customer service."}
{"text":"Great grilled Mexican food!  Small, not fussy place, family oriented.  Chicken was amazing, my husband had the grilled lengua, cabeza, and beef. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in all of AZ. No frills, cheap, and to die for delicious. Salsa is always fresh and excellent. Tortas and tacos are amazing. Love it."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken burrito and a bean/guacamole/pico de gallo/cucumber burrito, plus a medium and  large horchata drinks. Generous sizes on food and beverages. Came with a pinto bean soup, chips and salsa, and plenty of cukes, red onions, and lime. We both enjoyed our meals. Our waitress was attentive and obliging. The smell of the grilling smoke is almost worth a visit. Near airport car rental so great place for a quick bite before hitting the road."}
{"text":"Excellent Carne asada and traditional atmosphere. Food takes a while because it is made fresh and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"So delicious! I love it! Highly recommend it if you're craving Mexican food. I was working in the area and decided to stop by.  I love their Torta Pastor but I'm sure everything else is just as delicious. A plus is just the Torta alone is very filling. It's a great, clean and yummy place."}
{"text":"Da bomb. Such good food and delicious horchata. The people who work here are super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"If you like hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants that serve mind blowing amazing food, then you'll love this place. This place is the real deal. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"As far as delicious and affordable Mexican food goes, Asadero is king. I have had everything here from the Parrilladas to the Pollo Medio and never been disappointed

As a student in Phoenix, I probably ate here once a week (or more) for 4 years. The staff is friendly and the ambiance perfect enough to put down a quality burrito or plate of tacos. In my opinion, this is the best Mexican food that Phoenix has to offer. 

Their charro beans and Chile de Arbol salsa are life-changing. Stop reading this stupid review and go there now!"}
{"text":"Everything is relative, right? I don't want to give four-stars to a taco place, but as far as taco places go, this is one of the best in Phoenix. You need to know what to order though. Don't get the beef ribs, they are tough and chewy. Make sure you try the carne asada tacos, the cabeza tacos and a Mexican coke. You may also notice that the tortilla chips suck and come from CostCo. This is bad for tortilla chips, but good for the restaurant. They don't have a deep fryer, so they can't fry chips. But then again, they don't have a deep fryer! I bet there is no microwave in the kitchen either."}
{"text":"I had the 1/2 parilla and it was enough for two people.  I can't think of anything I didn't like about this place.  Fantastic food and very reasonable prices.  I'm looking forward to visiting again during my next trip to PHX."}
{"text":"Totally surprised by this place. From the outside it doesn't look like much - perhaps even a little run down. The amazing smell hits you as soon as you open the doors though. Amazing food, and the staff is super friendly. Everything is made fresh so make sure you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"Received Chips & Salsa and some Beans when I sat down! I ordered 3 Tacos (Beef, Pastor & BBQ) they came with fresh lime wedges, cucumber & Guacamole! Legit! All tasted fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's all relative. If this place was back home in SF, I'd probably give it 5 stars.  But in a city full of excellent, cheap Sonoran joints, this one rates 'very good' in my estimation.

I tried the chicken burro on a recommendation thinking it would be one of those dinky little burros I usually get here in Phoenix. But this was a full-sized affair; not Mission burrito big but enough to make a meal out of. 

Not knowing that, I also ordered a couple of tacos. The carne asada wasn't as flavorful as the best I've had, the old original America's Taco Shop on 7th. The barbacoa was lovely. 

Their chips reminded me of Fritos but the red hot sauce and little cup of frijoles a la charra were outstanding. So was the guacamole that accompanied my tacos. 

Next time I come here, I'm going to get the 1/4 chicken like just about everyone else in the place was eating."}
{"text":"Holy cow, I didn't realize I hadn't had the chicken here when I wrote my first review.

This place has become our unofficial work conference room.  Everyone is drawn to the magical chicken - moist and tender, with a crispy skin that bursts with flavor.  And ridiculously cheap - $10 for the whole bird, with fixin's.  The frijoles charros they serve before meals is worth the trip alone - I don't know what they do to them (it definitely involves bacon), but they are fantastic."}
{"text":"This is one of the best nondescript eating gems in Phoenix.  I've been coming here ever since my days as a student over a decade ago, and I'm still always amazed at the quality AND the quantity of food that is served here.  Any LA peeps reading this now who have been lucky enough to eat at Pollo a la Brasa in Koreatown?  Then you know what I'm talking about!!!

First off, the smells and aromas of the wood-fired chicken cooking outside is the first hint that you are about to partake in something special.   Forget about the sketchy exterior or the plain interior of the restaurant - you're here for the glorious chicken and nothing else.  Second, the perfect combination of mesquite-grilled chicken skin, juicy dripping meat, and equally tasty accompaniments will make you wish that you could live close enough to walk or bike here everyday.  Everything is fresh and authentic, and the value of the food here has no equal in Phoenix, except for possibly the Taqueria Los Yaquis food truck on Camelback.  

Restaurants like this is the reason why foodies exist."}
{"text":"Was here for the weekend and we were starving when we landed, after we got our rental car we looked for a place to eat nearby and this place had great reviews. Passed by and the place seemed kinda iffy but decided to give it a try anyway. Gotta say the frijolitos they give were really good, thought it was a good sign of the deliciousness I was about to have. I ordered an asada torta. The meat was pretty bad, had a whole bunch of those hard chewy bits. Just thought this place was ok. The only thing that would make me come back would be the beans lol."}
{"text":"Best beans! Best tacos! Very friendly. Never over packed. I love how they give you a snack before they bring out your meal.. This was the first taco spot I visited when I moved here from California and and returned every time I'm. Craving tacos..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best chicken I've had, you can taste the smoking, and it's not dry at all. Beans are great. Salsa is spot on. My only con is it took a while but I just assumed they were actually hunting the chicken in the back, that's how fresh it tastes."}
{"text":"My to-go street taco spot in the entire Phoenix valley. Fast service, yummy tacos and amazing prices! I visit this place at least once every month for my taco fix. Place looks like a hole in the wall place but tacos are really authentic and worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely authentic. The meat is great try a parilla, you can choose from three different meats."}
{"text":"Asadero continues to be great stuff.  In our household, we are now mesquite chicken addicts.  We usually order a whole chicken- it's definitely enough food for 2-3 hunry people, and just over 10 bucks... and we throw in some extras, too, like quesadillas.

Great little restaurant- cheap, family owned, a really good value, and delicious food.  One of my favorites in the Valley."}
{"text":"Trying New Mexican food restaurant with wife. This one is not one I would have normally come too looking at the outside. The previous reviews on yelp are what brought me into the door.

Long story short
Customer service was great
Food was better then I thought it would be. 
Only gave 4 stars due to parking and cleanliness."}
{"text":"FORGET ABOUT THE PARKING SITUATION! YOU ARE HERE TO EAT REAL MEXICAN FOOD! 

Extremely delicious, this is what AUTHENTIC is like. The moment you step inside, the smell of the grill and the food takes over and transports you to Sonora (or any other state in Mexico you'd like) and its pure magic. 

Prompt service that defies that of other places. Appetizers free of charge: chips and salsa, good salsa btw, and a small cup of frijoles rancheros, which you have to try with crumbled chips and salsa in the mix, makes them spicier and adds more flavor.

Best bets here are their wonderful carne asada torta, quesadillas de carne asada, pollo asado, I havent not liked any of the stuff I have had here. If this place were inside the W per se, it would inspire a chain of restaurants. 

Forget about the location, forget about the parking, forget about the fact that there might be homeless people outside, this is what true food tastes like in Mexico, and us Mexicans are lucky to have this place here in the Valley."}
{"text":"The best street tacos I've had north of the border. I had al pastor and beef and they were overflowing. Great charro beans - I ended up drinking the broth it was so flavorful. Don't let the location or the parking lot comments scare you away. We had no problems with the parking and the location is easy to find. Great hospitable service with quickly-served food at reasonable prices!
I forgot to mention the chicken - so flavorful wrapped in tortillas with some guacamole.
A new favorite spot on my way home from work!"}
{"text":"Great chicken burrito.  Store bought chips and possibly salsa too.  That was disappointing.  But go here for the chicken.  I'll definitely try a whole chicken (or two) to go next time.  Go early to avoid sketchy street parking."}
{"text":"Simple and super delicious! The chicken is tasty. The asada is delicious! The barbacoa is juicy and full of flavor. This lil hole in the wall restaurant never disappoints."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack. Two tacos, a side of grilled onions, free cup of beans and free chips and salsa came to under $6. Amazing deal. I had a pastor taco and a barbacoa. The pastor was very respectable, but the barbacoa was amazing, some of the best I've ever had. And the beans, with a subtle smoke flavor and tiny bits of meat in the broth, were a slow-burning hit as well. I just wish I had had time (and folks with me) to try a parillada. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"The half-chicken I ordered came with warm corn tortillas, salsa, guacamole, fresh cucumber slices and charro beans - and of course, a bowl of tortilla chips as starter. For the low price, it was quite a lot of food; they're pretty generous here. The mesquite-roasted chicken here is the best-tasting chicken I've had in a very long time. The salsa was more savory than what I've had in most other Mexican eateries and the guacamole was the thick creamy type - not the thin guacamole taquero served in taquerias. The charro beans were not quite as hearty or tasty as I had expected, but I'll give that a pass because the rest of the meal was really delicious, very filling, and quite inexpensive. It's a popular place (for good reason) but be aware that parking is very limited."}
{"text":"I came here based on my co-worker's recommendation for Mexican food in the Phoenix area. The restaurant was not too hard to find and there was plenty of parking when we arrived. Friend of mine ordered 2 beef tacos and 2 chicken tacos and I ordered a chicken taco and the chicken torta. Overall we preferred the chicken tacos over the beef tacos and the chicken torta that I ordered was extremely tasty. We would even go as far to say that these were some of the best tacos that we ever had and both of us have been to plenty of Mexican restaurants in the past.

If I ever make my way back over here I would like to try either the quarter or half chicken as that seems to be a solid choice based on the pictures here. I'm not sure if this is the best Mexican food in the area or not given that there are so many options available but either way this place is really good and definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"probably one of the best mexican restaurants i have ever ate. the food is pretty awesome, close to authentic but not quite. Their burritos are pretty big, so trust me it will be more than enough. and the best thing is their PRICES, yes their prices are super cheap. You could get a mesquite grilled half chicken(w/guac, ranchero beans, salsa, cucumbers and lettuce on the side) for $6.24. its enough chicken to feed two people. they also have 1/4 chicken, and whole chicken for more people. my favorite meat here is the Al Pastor(marinated pork). its probably the most authentic flavor of Al Pastor that comes closest to tacos in mexico. 

with tacos and combo meals you get the choice of corn or flour tortillas. Take it from me and trust me on this, get the flour tortillas. their corn tortillas seem to be the buy at the grocery store type. nothing special. If i had something negative to say, it would be that their corn tortillas really suck.

overall still 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great value and really good food. Taco platters are fantastic. Fresh tortillas and a selection of meats  with onions and peppers. The food is good, but not great. But for the money it's a great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, this is a great and affordable place to eat. The meats are so tender and the spices are fresh to eat. Literally everything tastes fresh off the grill. The guacamole is fresh and tasty. You feel like you're literally in Mexico . I'd definitely recommend this place to any person looking for food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very good meat.  Tried beef, chicken and pastor.  All high quality for low price.  Temperature inside was a little hot, but worth the heat."}
{"text":"This was not great. Not even good. Just ok. The meat is very hard. I just expected more based on the reviews. Meh"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food! Great prices and great quality! Cant wait to go back. 

This place is the best!"}
{"text":"Great value! I got a quarter chicken and my boyfriend got a half, and I'm pretty sure we spent less than $20. The borracho-style beans served with the entree were very good. But the chicken, the chicken was to die for. Grilled to perfection. The complimentary chips and salsa were good, but the chips tasted like they came out of a bag rather than made fresh there in the restaurant. The salsa was different from most, almost like a marinara. Very sweet. Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. Great portions and the food is great! I always get the full parillada that serves 3-4 people. You can get different meats and it all comes with tortillas, bean soup, guacamole, and salsa. You prep your tacos to your like. I defiantly would drive across town for the carne asada. Service is great, family owned and my waitress Alma was very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my oh my! Your mom, dad and tío don't make better food than \"Asadero Norte De Sonora\" that was the best I've had here in Phoenix. I'm originally from Yuma where the tacos taste like this. Mmmmmmm mmm! Oooooooo-weeee! It was warm in there but i don't care food was too good to care."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Good pork taco but carne asada had a lot of gristle (spelling?) in it. They did not have ANY chicken cooked and said it would be 30-45 minutes. Oh well. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Asadero is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. It's a must-visit every time we go back to visit. It's a small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with delicious food. I'm grateful to yelp for Asadero getting it's name out there more. Years ago, it was a word of mouth type place. Co-workers introduced me to it, I brought friends and family, and they'd bring their friends, etc. and it was like sharing a precious treasure, because their food is that good."}
{"text":"This place has bomb ass chicke. Great deal! Real mexican food! It's that authentic hole in the wall mexican food you're looking for!"}
{"text":"Ate here during Super Bowl week with some work buddies. 

Now I'm a gringo who's married into a Mexican family. I love and eat a lot of authentic Mexican food. I found Norte De Sonora to be just ok.  Maybe it's because their brand of authentic Mexican is from a slightly different region than my family's.  For example I've never seen cucumbers served on the side with salsa  

in any event the salsa was descent with a good kick. I had 3 tacos and each had good flavor.  

Chips and salsa were kind of weak and guacamole is small, leaving you wanting more."}
{"text":"Ordered the two-meat platter and chose the \"rib\" and the \"beef\" options. The rib was a little sparse on the meat, mostly fat. The beef/steak was a little dry and underwhelming as well. The meal came with guacamole, lettuce, limes, chips, salsa, and fresh flour tortillas. Overall, for $8.50, it wasn't bad at all. Not the best I've experienced, but certainly an excellent option if you happen to be passing by."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food.  The burro is not stuffed with all the added fluff like you get at other Mexican food places.  My Pastor burro was stuffed with meat, onions and cilantro.  The beans were an added surprise.  My husband had three different tacos and said they were all great.  Do not go in expecting the type of food loaded with rice and cheese, come here to experience authentic flavors and styles."}
{"text":"Twenty minutes for 4 tacos?!?! Haha yeah should've gone to the taco truck across the street. The tacos were not horrible but then again were nothing special especially with $1.90 tag....."}
{"text":"Rarely do I give a 5 star review and this place probably deserves it the most out of any place I've been! 

I give it 5 stars because of the authentic ingredients, amazing taste, incredible service, giant portions and awesome value! 

I've never seen a combination of all of the above like this place. This IS your \"hole in the wall authentic Mexican cuisine GEM\""}
{"text":"What a gem discovered thanks to Phoenix New Times naming it one of the Best Ten Tacos in Phoenix. Couldn't have been more correct.

Did exactly as New Times suggested and had THREE \"Taco al Pastor!\" Ambrosia! Waitress service, in spite of my not speaking Spanish, confirmed that I had made a great choice and also suggested I try the Coca Cola Mexico. (More on it later)

When the Tacos arrive they are quite lovely and just as described. Beautiful red-orange thinly sliced pork, obviously well marinated on perfect corn tortillas (my choice) topped with onion and cilantro. Homemade salsa, fresh lime and cilantro as well as some beans in a fabulous pungent liquid finish off the Presentation.

Don't let the barebones dining room turn you away and I can promise you won't be sorry.  My rule of thumb is that I won't do good Review unless I visit twice (will do a bad one after only one horrible visit) but I have taken that rule way too far with these Tacos from heaven. Let's just say my car can find Asadero Norte de Sonora on its own!  Check the hours because they are a bit strange but GO.

Now for the Coca Cola from Mexico. I am a former Coca Cola addict (NOT Diet), but hadn't had one in several years, because the last was absolutely awful and made me wonder what I ever liked about Coca Cola! Never had Coca Cola from Mexico. Different? AMBROSIA! I could become addicted to it, as well as this very special \"hole in the wall\" and its Taco al Pastor!"}
{"text":"I can't say how much I like this little place, but I'll try...

I have to agree with Paco, as you need to forget about the lackluster parking -- you're there for their FOOD, so quit whining about parking -- go there when others aren't. Simple as that.  I always go there during off-peak hours unless I'm nearby and want a great carry out meal.  I made the mistake once of going there on a Sunday, and I didn't even bother trying to go in, the parking was way too jammed for my liking, and I'll skip going to any food joint if I know it's jam-packed crowded.  I think if you try to save this place for off peak times, and tailor your schedule accordingly, you'll be in for a very pleasant surprise.  I don't do ANY food establishments when the general public's doing their fever-pitch rush hour thing. And Asadero isn't big enough to support that kind of crowd anyway.

I have never had ANYTHING but a GREAT MEAL there.  Hands down, it's one of my favorite places to go.  I don't know of ANY place where you can get a better fire-grilled chicken meal -- my favorite \"can't go wrong\" meal is their half chicken, with a REAL bottle of CocaCola in a heavy glass bottle.  The staff, as one review commented on, mostly don't speak English -- and yes, although their menu's (mostly) in English, I think anyone's smart enough to know how to use that index finger of yours and POINT if you're having a language problem.  I'm from NC, and most of the time I'm clueless as to what's what on the menu, not being very good at Spanish.  All that being said, whenever I do manage to go there (and I try to go there at least once a month) I order a basic meal, and usually buy a whole chicken dinner for two and make it last for several meals at home.

A LOT of attention to detail's given by Asadero, how can you go wrong when you order a half a chicken, and as usual, you're brought tortilla chips (although from a bag, they're great anyway), salsa (that's not exactly homemade, but it IS good), and a small bowl of their bean soup, that's LOADED with great spices, herbs and veggies, mixed with a broth base... when your meal arrives (and it's usually quick in coming) you get your super-great-tasting chicken, guacamole, lettuce, sliced cukes, radishes, a few key limes, sliced Bermuda onion, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I'm a hot pepper freak, so I always ask for a couple jalapeños off their grill to go along for the ride.

Since I'm always solo, I've always been super-impressed with the gigantic meals ordered and put on a stand on the table so everyone can share -- but there's no doing that when alone, so one day I hope to get a few friends to try some of their mixed grill meals.  I can't say enough about how much I enjoy Asadero Norte de Sonora -- I'm not a big fan of Phoenix as I'm a basic small town guy (and love actual WEATHER), but one of my favorite things about the area is how great the Mexican food is around here.  And seeing a close Mexican-American friend told me she and her husband go their for a 'down home' type meal, ever since I took her up on her advice I've been a very regular customer.

I'd take ANY review with less than 5 stars with a huge chunk of salt; you can't please everyone all the time, and some can't ever be pleased at all.  I feel if you pay attention to what I said about Asadero (especially WHEN you do go), you'll be glad you went there, and will be a repeat customer just like I've been for over 3 years now!"}
{"text":"Decided to pay this place a visit after reading Phoenix New Times 50 best tacos in the metro Phoenix area (they were ranked 16 in the list). Being ranked so high, I had to visit. The review raved about the parilla which consisted of three meats of your choice, beans, guacamole, salsa, and corn tortillas. I was actually a bit disappointed of how the ribs weren't succulent enough to fall off the bone  and beef asada was a bit chewy. For the variety and price you pay for, it's actually not bad. I paid $25.45 for the parilla with all the condiments to go. I will come back and give this place another try but will definitely choose different meats next time. The aroma of smoked grilled meats is just too tempting."}
{"text":"Our standard order is two whole chickens (dos pollos entero). We have nicknamed it Dos Pollos. For about $25, you get enough to feed 4-5 hungry men. There are lots of other things on the menu...but were sold on the chicken. We take out if town guests there and when they see how humble it is, they think we're joking. Then they go in, eat and know why we take them there. Go there. You'll love it."}
{"text":"After you eat here, just once, you'll be wrecked on eating tacos anywhere else in Phoenix.   Take 3 friends, and order the \"special\" where they bring a char-broiler to your table with 3 different kinds of meats.  Like $24.   Order guacamole.   It's actually guacamole, not mush.  The salsa is fantastic.   Kind of a rough neighborhood, but close enough to downtown you'll be fine.  Brush up on your Espanol and be prepared for some of the best eating you've ever done."}
{"text":"Great food,  great prices, and large portions. Definitely worth going again. The Pastor was very tasty  as Carne Asada."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick, easy meal off our flight, we found this place minutes from the airport. Each had 3 tacos. The pastor and BBQ were fantastic and the chicken was tasty if a little dry. 

Guacamole and chips are recommended. 

Simple, honest, and delicious. Go for it if you're looking for what the southwest does so well!"}
{"text":"Boom! my old favorite mexican food place closed awhile back, but this place easily takes my favorites list by storm.

Had the torta pastor and pollo asado burro. Both very delicious. Don't worry i didn't eat both...that would be horrifying. Servings are huge, the place smells EMACULATE! (what you expect an Asadero to smell like). I loved walking in there and getting the most beautiful aroma of bbq'd meat. MMMM

would I go. Yes! the trick is going when they are actually opened. I totally lucked out on this instance. I've only seen it open 3 times and I've drive past 100's of times. maybe i have bad timing. Anyways definitely note worthy on Phoenix's authentic mexican foods to try."}
{"text":"I am not adventurous as to try out places as I travel through a town but we picked some friends up at Phoenix airport and they wanted to try something so they started looking and decided this is where they are going. I walked in and it wasn't overly cool and the ventilation wasn't the best and I'm thinking this is not my thing. But the waitress came over and she was just the nicest lady and we ordered and got our food and it was delicious!! I would definitely go here again but do plan on leaving there smelling like food. I had a pastor taco which was great. The salsa was tasty. With everyone's meal came a small cup of hot bean soup. I am not much for beans but my husband ate mine and his both and said it was so good. Our friends at carne asada burritos and tacos and said they were amazing. So if you like true Mexican food your going to like this place."}
{"text":"It's in a sketchy neighborhood and the parking lot is tiny. The place is small, but the service and food are good.  It's the tiny street tacos and they're a little under $2 each.  The pollo one was dry, but the pastor and asada ones were good as was the quesadilla. It's near the airport so that was nice to grab it go."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite of mine since my first visit. If you can get past your upper middle class expectations of decor and can focus on the food, you will not be disappointed. It's authentic. It's delicious. And I can feed a family of four for $15."}
{"text":"You dont come here for the decor or the parking and maybe not even the service.  You come for the food.  I typically get the half chicken which is quite a bit of food.  I dig the beans too.  They also serve the coke in bottles which is made with real sugar and they taste much better.  Service isnt great, they're a bit slow and parking is terrible but the food is really good.  I have yet to go and NOT get good quality food.  If you want good authentic mexican food, you need to try this place, just dont expect much else."}
{"text":"The parrillada is delicious.  It comes with a variety of choices, among which you can choose three, I believe.  The only thing I'd think twice about are the costillas.  The ribs are actually incredibly delicious, but there is barely any meat sticking to them.  It's almost all bone.  It's kind of torture because of how good the little meat on them actually is.  All the other options are very good.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"My family and I happened to be driving by and decided to stop by for lunch.  I'm so glad we did! Place was busy which was a good sign.  

Absolutely your proverbial \"hole in the wall\" the food is what counts at a very good price.  

The service was excellent, the waitress came by several times to check on us.  

Upon entering, we could smell the charcoal roasting meat.  We ordered chicken and a mixed grill.   The chicken was moist with great flavor, and the mixed grill came out on a small tray with charcoal under it to keep the meat warm.  They served the .5 liter Coke. 

We are very satisfied and will absolutely return to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone can give this awesome spot anything lower then 5-Stars!!!!!
I drive for almost 2 hours one way to come to this gem of a taco/parrillada spot. It's small, quaint, parking can sometimes be an issue, feels like I'm in Mexico eating in a restaurant in TJ or Puerto Peñasco. The atmosphere is family friendly including the vendor that comes around selling home made bread and the the guy that plays the guitar singing Méxican folk songs and corridos on the weekends. The food is on point! I've tried everything on the menu and I've yet to be disappointed. The ribs are Beef Mexican style on the grill and not the american versión so don't expect them to fall off the bone you have to bite and enjoy the awesome ribs. I highly encourage anyone to come and try this sweet hole in the wall I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for local hole-in-the-wall places. This restaurant certainly fits the bill. Though known to the locals no doubt, it's definitely off the tourist path. Served is Mexican-style Pollo asado with all of the usual accompaniments among other traditional
Mexican favorites. 

Simple, understated and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is much like any place you'll walk in all through Mexico and Central America - I need places like this whenever I get sick with wanderlust.

Order the whole chicken and some carne asada tacos.  The food is amazing, their salsa is top notch, and they REALLY know how to cook up some carne asada.  You'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I had the 1/2 parilla it comes with your choice of three meets chille torriado sevollitas asadas and tortillas. The barbacoa was great and the pollo asado was really good as well I really did not like the asada nothing special needed a bit more seasoning. The complimentary porked beans were awsome and the guacamole on point. I love  that they don't charge an arm and a leg for extras. My meal was enough to feed 2 people and it was only 17 bucks. The red salsa is a bit sweet but wait for the kick it's surprisingly good if u like spicy food."}
{"text":"The beans were amazing. They were brought as an appetizer  with the chips and salsa. Salsa was spicy and tasty but chips were mediocre. Tacos were tasty, machaca  was my fav. Good find, would go back."}
{"text":"best chicken and carne asada ever, weill in Arizona. if you like Sonora style food this is the place to go.  love their salsa and their tortillas.  only downfall is because everything is made fresh you will leave smelling like mesquite wood.   Great service and food."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican restaurants I've been to. Tacos 10/10, tortillas 10/10. Consistency 10/10."}
{"text":"This was a save since the restaurant we first went to the chef walked out!  It was a suggestion from my son's co-worker. It's a small establishment, and was very busy but we got a table within minutes.  We shared the parilla and it was very good and just enough to fill us to the brim. Wonderful tortillas, excellent beans and the meats were perfect. We'll be back, often! Great wait staff as well."}
{"text":"Got say to say..this place is SOOO good takes me back to San Luis Rio Colorado Sonora.GOOD FOOD!..:)"}
{"text":"Fresh food. Clean. Friendly service.  It's a bit shabby on the outside but don't let that stop you! A hole in the wall restaurant with some great food!!!! The beans were my favorite! Had to order a side to go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another hit when I landed in Phoenix and was looking for some good Mexican.  I got an assortment of tacos (they said the flour ones are better, so did that) and at $1.90/each, they were off the charts.

Great value for money and amazing food and service."}
{"text":"I must be one of those \"chumps\" because I just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible. First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. 

When you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. 

Probably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type \"grilled steak\" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall restaurant, this place is great! Friendly staff, delicious food, good value for the prices. Whole beans were hot and fresh tasting. Caremello with carne asada, delicious! Taco de pastor was pretty good, chicken taco outstanding! I would definitely come back! Salsas lacked kick. Grade: A-"}
{"text":"We really liked the parillada that I ended up sharing with two other people. It comes in a half or full size. We got to pick three meats  with the full size and chose the  chicken,pastor and carne asada. We could have also picked lengua,beef Head and another meat i can't remember. I am not usually a big fan of pastor but this pastor changed my mind, it was very tasty. The chicken was really delicious and the carne asada was on point too. We had the choice of corn or flour tortillas and the platter also had several grilled vegetables piled on top- green onion, tomato and Guerito Chiles. They also gave us a plate with fresh cucumber, red onion and a bowl of guacamole. 

The three of us ate for $25 (including drinks) and even had to take food home because we could not finish the full size platter. Very good value and plenty of food. 

I would have given them five stars if they had more salsa choices, I personally love a good Salsa de Molcajete and that would have been a perfect compliment as it is a roasted type salsa. Their salsa was just basic and nothing to write home about. 

Also, it is very loud in the restaurant and hard to hear. So, we kept our mouths full with good food and kept the talking to a minimum since it was hard to hear. LOL

Asadero is on the southwest corner of Monroe and 16th St and the parking is a tight fit and very limited. However,  there is an empty parking lot on the other side of Monroe on the northwest side of 16th street that we parked at (as did several other families) and walked the short distance across the street. The only bad part about parking there was coming out after dark and seeing a suspicious guy lurking over in that lot. His body language implied he was up to no good, so be careful if you park over there because that parking lot is not lit at all and as overgrown bushes and trees with a low wall surrounding it making several places to hide behind. 

I am from Los Angeles and to go out to get some decent ethnic foods, you have to go to certain neighborhoods that sometimes are questionable. When doing so, you must be vigilant while in those type areas.  I felt I was back there coming out of the restaurant so,  I was  already very vigilant coming out and spotted the guy right away before we walked over there.We had our guy friend drive from the restaurant lot to the one across the street and the creeper guy got spooked and took off. 

We will go back for sure and will be a place to stop when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Best place for lemonaide and good barbacoa and beans . Reminds me of eating at a taco shop in Hermosillo. Price is good and atmosphere is unique. Decent price and delicious food."}
{"text":"Awesome lil taco shop, great food and great prices. The salsa and fijoles charros are awesome, wish the chips were home made but still delish."}
{"text":"Great food and the drinks were prefect!!!
Service was fast and friendly at a great price"}
{"text":"Best Asadero in Phoenix. We eat here as often as we can. It's a 40 min drive for us, but well worth the effort. Great chicken, pork, and carne asada. When friends come in from out of town this is our go to place!"}
{"text":"My previous review stands and remains 100% accurate Disregard the optics of the neighborhood and the building and ear here. Clean, friendly folks and the food is authentic and well above what one should expect in this price range. Just do this, you will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Omg the carne asada tortas are so good! I love this place. I have been here for take out a few times. The service is great, the food is even better!"}
{"text":"I had to pick my mom up at the airport, and decided to grab some lunch at this joint.  I had read about it before, and finally made it down this way to get some chicken!

I walked in and was immediately assaulted by the smell of deliciousness!  It was even a little bit smokey in there!  That was a good sign!  There were maybe a dozen people sitting down eating lunch.  A quick glance at their tables made me start to drool.  I couldn't wait to grub!

I walked up to the register to place my order and this is where I ran into just a wee bit of a problem.  I asked the lady if I could order a half chicken, all white meat.  She got a little confused and called over to another lady working there.  She informed me that they could do two 1/4 chickens with white meat, but couldn't do a half chicken all white meat.  Why does it matter, you ask?  A quarter chicken is $5.50, and a half chicken is $8.00.  Way better value/deal for the half chicken.  At most other Mexican pollo places I have been to, they will let you get the pieces you want for the same price, or maybe charge you an extra buck or two in order to substitute all white meat.  Not here though.  Kind of lame, definitely more expensive, but whatever.......  I was dead set on getting 2 breasts and 2 wings for my lunch, so I went with the 2 quarter chicken meals.  My total came out to $11.91.  I took a seat and waited for my food.  About 5 minutes later, they brought out my plastic bag (yeah California....take that!  Plastic bag...and it was free, lol jk) full of my lunch.  I took it to the car and when I closed my door, my car was engulfed with a lovely smell. 

I drove down to the airport cell phone parking lot, undid my bag, and inside was a bunch of stuff!  A container of frijoles, a little thing of guacamole, a little thing of hot sauce, a tin foil wrapped pile of corn tortillas, and my styrofoam box of chicken.  I did notice that there was no fork in there.  There were 2 spoons in there, but no fork.  WTF?  Lame!  Also, since this was \"2\" 1/4 chicken meals, shouldn't I have received double of all the condiments?  (I didn't NEED an additional order of beans, guacamole, hot sauce and tortillas, but still....if you are going to charge a la carte, shouldn't you get everything like it was \"2\" separate orders?)  Anyways......  Here is how it was.................

Mexican Grilled Chicken Meal-  First of all, I just want to say that this was the best chicken I have had yet in Phoenix!  This chicken reminded me of my San Diego joints, and was even better than most of them!  The chicken had a beautiful red/orange skin on it and it looked amazing!  I picked apart most of the chicken and separated the bones.  I took a bite into the breast and hit all the textures right away.  Crispy skin, slightly dry (I prefer a drier chicken over a moister chicken...this was in the middle kind of....fucking delicious!), but had the perfect flavor!  It was SO.DAMN.GOOD!  The wings were real small, but still packed great flavor, too!  I kept taking my pieces of chicken and alternated dipping them in the guacamole (tasted just like what I make at home....avocado, some salt and pepper, and some onion....very simple and very pure!) and the hot sauce (nice heat, vinegar based hot sauce).  The plate came with a little salad, cucumbers and onions but I didn't eat those.  Even though I am trying to limit the carbs, I had to try the tortillas...I had 2 of them and they were awesome, too!  I finished my meal and was smiling from ear to ear!

Overall, this was a great lunch! 4, and not 5 stars just because I was a little upset that they couldn't accommodate my all white meat request without having to go the a la carte route, and the fact that they didn't give me a fork on a to go order.  Considering how good this chicken was, those are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.  I'll just know how/what to order next time.  The chicken was flat out amazing!  I will definitely be back!  It's a drive from Surprise, but this may be my new chicken spot in Phoenix.  Man, it was great!"}
{"text":"My new favorite joint! $15 worth of food fed three people, including drinks and chips, and left me so full that I couldn't even drink a beer after wards. 
Wasn't impressed by the bean burrito, but the meat was fantastic-soft and packed with flavor. 
I agree with Paco-you're here to eat, not fixate on parking; this isn't Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"This place has some delicious chicken! Their charro beans & flour tortillas are fantastic too. The service was good and everyone was friendly. I love salsa & typically like it spicy, but their salsa was a bit too much for me. I wish they had another that was more like a chunky, spicy, pico de gallo. If the salsa had been better, I would have given 5 stars.
Tips for newcomers: It's a sit down & order place. When you're done, you just go up to the podium and pay, they won't bring a check to your table."}
{"text":"Straight up best Mexican food I've ever had. amazing food. I got the Diced Steak signature plate thing....Comes with 6 small taco shells. It's so friggin good. Just do it."}
{"text":"Best burrito in town!!  Especially the Pastor Burrito. Great beans and chips for free."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot. The grilled chicken is some of the best in Phoenix. Highly recommend if your looking for good authentic Mexican Downtown."}
{"text":"all you chumps who rave about the \"authentic\" mexican \"fare\" at carolina's need to calm down and head over to this joint on 16th street. their parilladas (grill platters) come with your choice of grilled meat(s) on a hot bed of coals, with guac, radishes, cucumbers, onions, salsa, tomatoes and two kinds of beans on the side. the $9 half order (with up to two kinds of meat) is plenty for two. 

parking is impossible, and the first time we went there these two homeless dudes came in and stole the tip some other couple had left for the waitress. we felt bad so we left her a 50% tip, but she didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Out of all the small local asadero / taqueria in the downtown Phoenix area we have tried, we continue to return! They have consistent, quality and authentic Mexican food! The service is always friendly and fast. Do not be deceived by the look, or the lack of parking, the food and service (bilingual) is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Simple, great tasting food, aptly named for its northern Sonora style . The frijoles charros are a wonderful start. Fresh limeade, tacos de asada--authentic feel at a great price."}
