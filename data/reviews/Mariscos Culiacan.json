{"text":"Food was good, not the best or the worst ceviche. Friendly waitress, clean restaurant , and good size portions. My dad enjoyed his fish ceviche and pescado a la plancha. Flan was ok, think they get it from another restaurant came in a sealed tupperware. Bathrooms were clean and plenty of room to park."}

{"text":"I was very impressed with Mariscos Culiacan!  This AUTHENTIC Mexican food/seafood, not just another knock off Filibertos.  I had a Pescado Entero (Whole Fish, Fried), and it was fantastic!  My brother had the Carne Asada Plate, and I can say that the meat was actually grilled, not pan fried like so many places.  I would highly recommend it!"}
