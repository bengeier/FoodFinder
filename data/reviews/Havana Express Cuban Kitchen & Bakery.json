{"text":"Alright, so today was my 2nd try here, and I'll give it to them, they are new and still working out the kinks, cool I get it. Now the 2nd time coming, I really gotta say that the workers who are working the line up front NEED to communicate with the cook in the back, or at least write the orders down so that way people aren't only getting half of there order and the cook not knowing about the other half. This happened the first time, and now the second time, not with just me but with others too, getting the wrong order or not all of it. Also, when the cashier handed me my sandwiches and I didn't get my fries with it, they were trying to tell me it doesn't come with fries? Uhm, then why does your menu say \"Sandwich combo's served w/ French fries\"? Luckily I believe the owner or manager stepped in and corrected it by giving me my fries, little annoying but ok.   Now, the food is good, but nothing super crazy. I'm a fan of the Frita Cubana (Burger), good flavor and the sauce is very flavorful. I also ordered the Pan Con Lechon (Pork Sandwich), now this was a huge let down cause it looks good but it had no salt or very little, nor any sauce to moisten the meat at all, it was just bread and shredded pork. Could have been a fluke with the cook cause he did look a little flustered with orders, but come on now that's basics. The fries that I did end up getting were steak fries, again with no salt. Bummer.   In all honesty, I do feel the place has potential, but it just seems like there are a lot of people who are very inexperienced working there that are hurting the business, not to mention it's \"Cash Only\". The place inside looks nice, and spacious but maybe instead of investing in how the place looks, maybe throw some attention to staffing, at least with an experienced kitchen worker who knows how to multitask and communicate with his cook so that way orders aren't being forgotten.   I wish this place the best, maybe they'll figure it out later down the line, but at the moment, I can't say I'll be spending my money here."}
{"text":"Havana Express is a 2 out of 5. Food is bland, and you only get 2 sides (versus 3 sides both at Carlito's Cuban Food # 1 and El Tinajon. Also, the workers at Havana Express are terrible when compared to the family operation at El Tinajon and the super efficient and friendly workers at Carlito's Cuban Food # 1. I had hoped Havana Express would be OK too but I am not likely to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was awful, super greasy food and just didn't  taste well but the owner Sergio was the worst, he should make sure that people don't understand Spanish when he is making snide remarks, about customers in his establishment. Sorry that i wasn't able To give 0 stars"}
{"text":"Just went 12/11/17 staff was super nice...yes it is only a cash establishment...so hit the atm before stopping by you cant miss out....I passed by for some treats and picked up a few....Africanas...señoritas...tartaleta.... panetela borracha...I will definetely need to stop again to try the rest of the YUMMY treats they have...they also have good music playing...the food looks good and will have to try it on my next trip there...keep up the good work Havana express!!"}
{"text":"Just because I feel like a jerk with 1 star because they were nice but service isn't great, wait too long for my food. Prices aren't bad but then the food reflects the prices. Food was indeed bland and fries were chewy. Nothing I ate was fresh. Felt like a leftovers meal. Just being honest. Never really ate cuban food so def disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not alot of flavor but I guess thats what you get with fast food. It be nice to know cash only before you stand in line for 10 minutes before they show you a little sign that says \"cash only\".  Service was ok. Just opened so ill give you another try pretty soon. Im all about supporting my Cuban community,  but please get it together. Thank you."}
{"text":"Me encanto la comida!!!!! Tienen buen servicio y buena variedad. Se los recomiendo. Esta acogedor y en una muy buena zona."}
{"text":"I had seen this place a while ago. Stopped by a few times to see if it was open. Nothing. Then my friend and I were running errands and noticed people inside so we decided to stop and order cafe con leche ( coffee with milk) and a guava pastry.   Delicious!!! Coffee was hot and sweet. Guava pastry was crisp and recently baked.   Customer service overall can definitely use a pick me up.  Following day went in again. Ordered the same thing cafe con leche but instead of a guava pastry I ordered toast with butter. Took them 30 min to get that ready!   This place has great potential! They seriously need to get someone to train them and figure their stuff out."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The price is right. The service could be better, but they are just getting started."}
{"text":"This is my second attempt to eat here .The first since they had the flood service is still really bad after standing at counter for 5 minutes finally girl asked for my order.I ordered the roasted chicken combo she had no idea what that was after several times showing her on the menu i just gave up and walked out.She thought is was funny no wonder you don't have any customers i wish arbys would still be there."}
{"text":"Found my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. The service, the welcoming feeling, the delicious food and the prices.....should I keep going?  Sitting here eating hearing the Cubans speak around me gives me that home feeling and I love it. I will be back for sure. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a great place to eat Cuban food and a great price with excellent service."}
{"text":"I like to support my cuban community, and like many Cubans a cuban sandwich is the perfect lunch meal. Unfortunately this place is not great, or good. Or even mediocre. I had the cuban sandwich and it was just terrible. Bread was not cuban bread, way too much mustard, Swiss cheese was not melted there was a ton of ham and barely any pork (lechon). The taste was awful, or rather lack thereof. I wish it ended there. But it goes on to even the smallest of cuban items. The ham Crogueta were mush inside and so soft on the outside it fell to the ground. I would be upset if it was worth it. But it wasn't, seeing it fall to the floor was a blessing. This place is spending alot of money on the facility, they need to spend money on quality. I'll give them another try, but with 3 other cuban places up the street is gonna be hard for them to stay open. Save your money and go to Cuba cafe where the food is a bit better. I recommend this place to make a trip to California and try a Portos cuban sandwich. Maybe they'll learn how to make it. At this point, I'll just stick to making them at home. Thanks for trying. Wish this place the best."}
{"text":"OMG. The BEST Cuban food I have ever had. And I've been to several in town. The Pecadillo empanada was unbelievable!! Thanks."}
{"text":"Puro Fuego! La comida me dio ganas de tirar mi suegra la suegra de la casa porque ya no lo ocupo! La comida es rica y muy accesible económicamente hablando"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Prices are AMAZING! Food is AMAZING!! Portions are AMAZING! Esta muy MUY bueno!!! Pollo Asado, papa relleno, maduros etc.."}
{"text":"The food is good I keep on coming back and it doesn't disappoint. Yeah there are communication issues but they pack your plate with food like you are family. Really great price"}
{"text":"Great new Cuban place! Nice atmosphere with old boom boxes, car emblems, and Cuban memorabilia on the walls. Awesome food too! :)"}
{"text":"Muy delicioso!!!! Los tamales muy ricos 100% recomendado. Su atención al cliente muy buena, son muy amables."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place so much I go every weekend with my family. The food is delicious and deserts are to die for. Pricing is very good and affordable .  The manager William Villanueva is so helpful team player always helps his staff clean or help ring up customers. Very nice person. Food is always fresh here not like Carlito restaurant where food seems like it's reheated from day before though out the day. And you come smelling stinky and have to have a shower right after you eat there. Also what I love about Havana express is that they have so much Cuban culture in there restaurant. Another plus is that they have AC . That's a big plus for me especially living in vegas with this heat is AC. Carlito it's super hot inside there only a few tables to eat at and your sweating while eating your food. I really recommend this restaurant ignore what these other comments are saying it's a great restaurant. Very clean , people are nice and have amazing food. If your looking for something to eat that's authentic and cheap come to Havana express they really take care of you with there large portions."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch... it was ok. I was headed out for my 2nd visit. Health department was there and my visit was cut short, owner better step up and run the business or the doors will close."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY BUSINESS!!! (before you drive there go to ATM lol) So far so good, went in yesterday (12/9/17) had a Cuban cafecito (basically a cuban espresso) and some dessert. I'm not the biggest fan of Cuban food, but the little that I tried was amazing. They just opened so it may be a little chaotic but it's very good and Extremely affordable!!! My cafecito and dessert was under $4!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for quick and affordable cuban food that tastes like a home cooked meal and not an overdone restaurant style. Mainly you are served food from whatever they have prepped on the food line and it's always good. I seem to be there a lot because it's good. Only drawback is everyone has heard about it so there might be a line."}
{"text":"I really like Cuban food.  Just like eating at someone's home, flavors & cooking styles may vary among restaurants.   I had a great low cost meal on Th 5/17/18. Service was great. I was greeted right away & allowed time to decide on my meal (I hate being rushed).   I had the pollo asada, moros, & maduros  (Roast chicken, black beans & rice cooked together, fried ripe plantains).  This $5 combo: Real food, was good, the price was right.   I'll be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"We were out doing some work and looked it up. Came in the place was very clean, we were greeted, and w ordered two traditional dish, Fricase De Polo, and Picadillo, with black/red beans, tostanes. All we can say Wow! Large portions, food was freshy cooked. We ordered traditional cuban expresso coffee. We higly recommend this place all the way from Los Angeles."}
