{"text":"Ok full disclosure. In my youth, I have had plenty of the famous dirty water dogs in nyc. It's a taste treat you'll never forget. The dog I had today took me back. It had that wonderful snap when you bite into it and the flavor and spice combination of the meat made me think about grabbing a couple outside GCT. The mistake I made was loading up my dog. I ordered it with too much stuff which took away from the star of the bun. Speaking of bun, I think this one is too big which is part of the issue when there's too much stuff on top. Next time I'll probably just order mine with mustard and onions. That should be just about perfect for this dog."}

{"text":"I ordered the 11\" hot dog with chopped onions and ketchup. Nothing too special, but it was so good that I had to go back and get another before leaving! Very nice people and a bonus for accepting credit/debit card. We have new food trucks visit our workplace every Wednesday so my colleagues and I have sampled quite a few hot dog trucks. All of the other hot dog trucks are way over-priced so I'm glad this truck was reasonably priced. It's no Costco deal, but for convenience and deliciousness, the few extra dollars is well worth it! This was a great food truck and I'm hoping they make it back soon."}
