{"text":"A seasonable evening with the lady brought me here.  The concept is great, the menu has a diverse offering for all tastes and appetites.  We tried the cherry bombs and salmon roll to start.  Both were unique in their own right, but they tasted great!  They have a chefs menu that changes daily based on seasonal ingredients.  This was fantastic.  Great spot for a date, intimate  lighting and cozy seating.  Worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 8pm on a Friday. Since it was our first time, we got there a little early to sit at the bar and have a drink. Quality service behind the bar.  Sat on the patio. It was really cool to see this newer addition to Cleveland. Sitting on the patio and seeing all the foot  traffic was unexpectedly cool. University Circle did a great job developing this area. Go Cleveland!  Servers were slammed but our server Rebecca was great. She gave solid suggestions and always checked up on us.   Food was really good and well priced. Smaller plates were a good fit for us. If you like deviled eggs you will enjoy their two variations on the classic, but they still have a lot more to offer on the menu.  Going back next weekend."}
{"text":"Great food.  I mean the menu is fantastic, with so many tasty options.  I loved my chicken curry.  Anything with lamb is delicious at Crop.  The trout is outstanding.  My wife thinks the noodles are underwhelming, but not everything can be great.    I do find that the service is really, really slow.  The waitstaff is attentive.  You get your water class refilled quickly.  But be prepared to wait a long time after you order to get your food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - upscale casual. Service - good; waitress was very nice, service was prompt Deviled eggs - great, similar to Crop Restaurant  Calamari - great, similar to Crop Restaurant Warm Salad - ok flavor, not my favorite.  I almost ordered this alone without the salmon, but glad I did not! Ribs - great Salmon (large plate) - large portion, cooked just right, flavor was ok  While there is nothing wrong about this place, the flavor was just ok, nothing terribly special.  For the price, I'd probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great and attentive service - from reservation to waiter. Great drink menu - cocktails, wine and beer. Amazing food (as usual!)  Basically like the original crop but more causal atmosphere! Love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate here on a Saturday night. Our previous experience a few months ago was terrific, but this time it was off...way off. First, the hostess sat us right next to the door and we had to request to be moved.  Then, we were informed that the menu had changed over to the summer one. There were about 3 pages of alcohol and only one page for food. There were also no specials for the night and they no longer had sushi. We were very disappointed and had a hard time finding something on the sparse menu to eat. He ordered the burger, nothing special. I got the Cropicana bowl that the server described as having lots of vegetables. When it arrived, there were no veggies and 3 small shrimp that they were charging $1 for each. I ended up sending it back because it was flavorless and ordered the chicken sandwich. Again, nothing special. We really had high hopes for our second time around, but unfortunately we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We have had great meals here before, but tonight's dinner was disappointing. The pasta dish was too spicy (one of our party couldn't eat her meal at all) The black bean and rice dish was the only vegetarian option, and the beans were spicy and the rice was unseasoned. A lump of shredded cheddar helped. The special was blackened scallops, so that's another spicy offering. The braised short ribs were so dry as to be inedible. One of our party received the wrong meal. The drinks were good but took a very long time to arrive. When the appetizers arrived we asked that a second round be delivered with our main course, but they did not arrive until we were half way through. We won't be back unless the reviews improve."}
{"text":"Good food, even better drinks! Amazing service. Going back, for sure. Shared some small plates -- calamari, pork belly bites, spring rolls. All delish. The atmosphere is relaxed ... Perfect for what we were looking for. Double thumbs up! I've been to CROP and I would choose this place first every time."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. \"Crap Kitchen\" almost ruined Summer Solstice for us. Waited over an hour for DRINKS. We walked out. Damn shame. Great location, nice ambiance, but overall terrible experience due to possibly the worst service I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"The best calamari appetizer we have had. Also, great ambiance (casual but classy). The meatloaf sandwich was bomb."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Crop Bistro and was worried about being disappointed, but my worries were unfounded. The menu was eclectic but entertaining and service both at the bar and from our server (Laurynn) was outstanding. The relaxed, open environment was very enjoyable and I will definitely return.  Well done all around!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Must try the pork belly appetizers. Too full for dessert but must have the egg nog bread pudding next time."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic addition to the Uptown/University Circle neighborhoods. Recently went here on opening night. Thought I would give it a try after being a long time fan of Crop Bistro. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The food was inventive and delicious. The mussels are a must! I was also excited to see that there is a rotating selection of sushi and sashimi. Great selection of wines and cocktails as well. The space is relaxed and inviting, with an assortment of seating including large communal tables. The bar is great for catching any of the upcoming cavs games, and it features a large pool table, which is hard to find in the uptown neighborhood. I will definitely be coming here often. Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I thought the service was very good, but the food just was not that great. I had the meatloaf sandwich. It came out very quickly but the roll was soggy from the sauce. It says \"sriracha mayo\" but the spiciness does not come through. The spice of the meatloaf is overpowering and whites out any other flavors."}
{"text":"Wonderful eclectic and fun beer and wine list along with an open nice patio. Service was right-on and my 3 courses worth many returns. I hope to be in Cleveland again so I may return to Crop Kitchen. I drank and IPA and 2 tasty Saisons. The soup was massive, vegan and filled with flavors. I wrote notes on the warm salad hoping to duplicate it at home and the udon noodle bowl as tasty and most Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"We tried Crop Kitchen last night for the first time.  The atmosphere was fun and it was a beautiful place.  We had two appetizers:  goat cheese dumplings and belly bites.  Both were excellent!  My husband had the curry chicken, which he loved, and I had the beet salad which was also delicious.  We also had a pear dessert that was delicious.  We met the owner and his son (chef) Stevie.  Both were friendly and nice.  Our server, Frank, was outstanding and made it a great experience."}
{"text":"The food is truly sublime. The service is friendly and exceptional - thanks Matthew!!. Loved it! Go with friends, family or colleagues - they'll all love it!!"}
{"text":"This review is about the state of affairs at Crop Kitchen.  Since I've been eating and drinking there, I've had continuously great service and conversation from the bar staff and host staff.  I've usually gone for happy hour after work.  The food has been very good and the price points are a good deal.  But there has always been a lurking, sinking feeling to the place as if there is a rift.  Since last August, they've gone through four managers.  The general vibe is a mix between malaise, disorganization, disregard, and distrust between management and the staff.  This then feeds to the customers.  I have always gotten the feeling that the staff are underappreciated and underpaid.  These are my impressions every time I've eaten there and my friends have noticed these things too.  So, let's emphasize, the staff are really great (except for a couple) and the hostesses are terrific, it's the management that makes me wonder how long this place is going to last.  The solutions are simple, pay your managers better, respect your managers more, and give them the authority to run the place rather than it coming from the corporate top down.  That would help a lot."}
{"text":"I had a pretty poor (albeit limited, so I'll refrain from giving 1 star) experience here. It's the cheaper alternative to Crop Bistro downtown apparently, but \"cheap\" is honestly relative, I'd much rather pay the higher prices for Bistro than here.   Service was excruciatingly slow for an arguably quiet night in the restaurant, it wasn't packed by any stretch of the imagination. Probably in part due to our waiter spending more time flirting with the girls at our table than actually taking our orders.    I ordered the \"pic mac\", a $13 pork version of the Big Mac at McD's. Honestly, probably one of the worst meals I've ever eaten at a restaurant in Cleveland. The sandwich itself is tiny, and the pork was the driest, most tasteless cardboard I've had the good fortune of having to choke down, and there was definitely not enough else in the sandwich (including the sauce) to make up for it. To be fair, the potato salad it came with was excellent.   Definitely not worth a $16 bill for 2 hour (yea you read that right) dinner that consisted of one tiny awful sandwich. I would much rather buy like, 4 big mac's instead, I'd say they even taste better. Maybe the other dishes are good, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"After coming here one more time, I can pretty confidently say there isn't much that will bring me back. The deviled eggs are good, yes. And the burger I had was good, but nothing extraordinary. But, I think there's just something wrong overall here. I can't put my finger on what is exactly bringing the place down, but I can say what is causing trouble. The decor is weird, the food is lackluster, and the service isn't the best.   I feel like I'm in a confused restaurant. Does it want to be a sports bar (pool table and TVs) or does it want to have a low-key, focused-on-the-food atmosphere (dining tables and farmer's market art on the walls)?  Aside from the atmosphere, there's the service. The service I had the first time was good, the second time was a little lackluster, the third time was horrible. The bartender was busy flirting/socializing with some other customers and I got the wrong beer. Then I had to wait quite awhile for her to come back after getting distracted again. She just seemed like she was in a different world and didn't really care about us as customers.  Then there's the food. Aside from the eggs and burger being OK, there's the tofu mushroom \"burger\", which was actually really difficult to eat and lacked flavor. The truffle popcorn was pretty meh (popcorn is pretty much my favorite food and I can say I've made better). And the prix fixe menu on NYE wasn't nearly what I expected of this place.   So, to recap: the only thing I've REALLY liked here are the eggs, which I'm pretty sure I can make at home. Not a fan."}
{"text":"This place was delicious & very affordable! I totally recommend it! Get the meatloaf!!! Best meatloaf I have ever tasted at a restaurant! I ordered the braised pork, and although it was quite tasty, I wouldn't order it again.  For appetizers, we had the chile deviled eggs (had a little kick to it) and pork spring rolls! Two delicious apps that held us over until dinner arrived, literally right after we finished our appetizers.  I cannot wait to go back to Crop Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful late-night meal there with friends recently.  Custom crafted cocktails and an extensive beer and wine menu made for a difficult drink choice!  For a meal, I chose the fried chicken sandwich served with a side of couscous.  The sandwich had a unique flavor and the chicken was pounded out flat making for a nice texture and lots of fried surface area.  The couscous was outstanding with a light dressing on top.  Great spot for a bite after movie viewing at the Cinematheque."}
{"text":"Very glad I visited. I got a flight of beer which was a nice start. The pork bites were absolutely amazing! Definitely try those for an appetizer.  They have great variety in food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So disappointing! They try to do too many different cuisines and it's all mediocre. Our table had the burger, sushi, and the udon noodles, and everything was pretty meh. I appreciate that thy are using high quality ingredients, but you can't just stop there, you have to know how to use them. Wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"The beef udon was incredible. I also like the interior design of the restaurant. Definitely would like to visit again."}
{"text":"Location - 5 stars Ambience - 4 stars Service - 5 stars Goat cheese dumplings five stars** Must Have! Deviled eggs - 3 stars I wouldn't order again. Warm Salad - 5 stars, I would order again.  I would come back."}
{"text":"After driving past the new Crop in Uptown a week ago, I made a point of heading up there this past weekend to try it out.  Before going of course, I checked out the Yelp reviews.  I have to say I went into this assuming I was going to give a glowing review.  The previous Yelp reviewers were mostly positive, with most of the dissenters being around service and decor.  Online reviewers in general can be a bit, ummmm, snobby sometimes and I thought that might be what was happening.  I should have trusted my fellow Yelpers, as (with one exception), I think you pretty much nailed it.  Food is pretty decent.  I didn't find it incredible, but it was definitely above average.  Kind of what you'd expect for a casual, upscale place.  What's dragging my rating down is the service.  We sat at the bar and the server that initially waited on us was abrupt and definitely had better things to do than wait on us.  While others stepped in here and there to take orders and remove plates, overall I found the wait staff not to match the level of service the kitchen was trying to set.  So on this I agree with other reviewers.  At least one review mentioned the decor.  I didn't find this to be a problem and in fact thought the place was laid out pretty nicely.  It's not luxurious, but then again, I think they're going for a more casual vibe so it works.  Menu-wise is where I might have a small issue with layout.  If you look at the menu online, it looks fairly small.  There are actually quite a few daily specials.  The problem is they are chalkboard specials and the chalkboard is high up on the wall.  Like - right below the high ceiling on the wall.  Pretty inconvenient.  Not a major issue, but just inconvenient.    So all in all, definitely a place to try and form your own opinions.  For me I have to give it a solid 3 stars for average - food slightly above average, service below average."}
{"text":"Our first trip wasn't exciting. We had our dinner this weekend, ordered Tea noodles and sushi. I may not recommend this place based on my first visit, but will update my review if I happen to have a better experience later on.  Tea Noodles: I was not aware that it would be cold, I thought it would be hot as regular noodles (I should have read the menu carefully). It was a disappointment.  Sushi: We ordered Tempura and California rolls. Tempura was OK, I didn't like the California roll. Wasabi was bland, it missed that specific flavor (not sure how to describe that flavor). They do not have low sodium soy sauce, which was surprising."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I've given four stars to despite being disappointed in my main course.  But let me explain. And let me start with a cocktail that features a giant piece of candied bacon draped over it. That would be the bourbon-based \"Mr. Figgy\" ($12). I don't need to elaborate, do I?  And then lets move to the appetizer -- Goat Cheese Dumplings ($8) which were surprisingly light and fluffy, looking more like gnocchi, and they came with shiitake mushrooms and a miso vinaigerette that created a solid umami taste.  Jeannene had the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon ($21)... hold on, at this point I want to point out that this was the most expensive item on the regular menu so you get the idea the food is quite affordable... now, as I was saying the salmon was lovingly grilled as was a half of pear that came with it. Fried black rice and a Sweet Tamari reduction also complimented the heavy fish.  So, they obviously know how to season their food so I was a bit disappointed in my Chicken Curry Rice ($16). It was perfectly cooked but quite bland when I wasn't parceling out the dab of siracha sauce that was on one corner.  But I'll chalk that up to a lone bad dish, not a bad restaurant and the dessert confirmed that -- a slice of whipped pumpkin, honey oat and chocolate ganache ($7) -- had three or four textures working in concert while all the flavors blended perfectly.   This is a successful effort to take the concept of a high-end restaurant and make it less expensive and more casual without sacrificing food quality (not counting the chicken curry)."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. We ordered sushi (california roll) and shshito peppers as apetizers, and the curry chicken and beef udon noodles as entree. Everything was fresh, tasty, and the portions were right. Thewaitress, Rebecca, was really good: she suggested the curry chicken and the carrot cake as dessert, with honest opinions on everything on the menu. The price was definitely worth it. We'll suggest this place and come back often!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the day before I moved out of Cleveland. It's a really huge space with tall ceilings and windows. Service was largely impeccable, though I'd expect that since we came for a weekday lunch and there weren't too many tables (hard to tell, it looks as though there are 100 tables in this place!)  1. Truffle popcorn - fun appetizer. The popcorn is unsalted and there's balsamic and Parmesan cheese on top. Use your hands!  2. Mac 'n cheese with pulled pork - Delicious and I don't even like mac and cheese (I don't like crazy amounts of cheese). The bbq pulled pork was a tasty addition. The only thing was that my friend and I both wished the sauce was thicker so it'd stick to the pasta better. Instead, we were left with a pool of cheese sauce at the bottom. Maybe the roux wasn't as well-made?  3. Crop Kitchen burger - nothing special to write home about. Delicious, and came with the side of the day which was wild rice. Not a fan of the rice, so I ate the salad on the side while my friend ate the rice, haha.  Overall, a good experience that wasn't too expensive for lunch at a trendy sort of place. I'd come here again if I didn't already move out of state...haha."}
{"text":"I just returned from NYC where I had a lot of amazing meals, but Crop Kitchen blew away all of my NYC meals. We celebrated a good friend's birthday tonite and it was perfect from beginning to end.  Our server Matthew was professional, knowledgable, warm and fun, and really added to our wonderful experience.  I'm a vegetarian, one friend is a flexatarian, and one is a carnivore, and we all had excellent options.  We started with the roasted shishito peppers with lime and sea salt, plus miso orange popcorn. Our handcrafted cocktails were unique and delicious... The pumpkin applejack martini called Sleepy Hollow was perfect for a cold winter's night and the stone fruit Cosmo was like no Cosmo I've ever had, in a good way.  The space is cosmopolitan yet cozy and cool. Free valet parking if you're dining at Crop.  My warm autumn salad was out of this world plus healthful, my one friend raved about her fish tacos, and the birthday girl said her hangar steak was out of this world.  I am a bread pudding aficionado, and I'm not exaggerating when I say the caramel bread pudding with roasted banana gelato was the best I've ever had.  Thank you Crop Kitchen chefs and Matthew for an unforgettable birthday celebration for a special friend. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The girls and I came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my birthday.  None of us had been before and it was something we really wanted to try.  I'm definitely glad that we did!   Walking in, Crop Kitchen had a really cool vibe-there were floor to ceiling windows, chalkboards with daily specials, and big, wooden tables.  It was pretty full for a Thursday and was, consequently, loud but that just meant people were enjoying themselves!   The waitress was very attentive, and we all had water poured before we even had a chance to settle in.  I ordered a \"blood and roses\" drink which sounded very creative on the menu and I knew I had to try it.  I loved the muddled fruits and how the blood orange worked with the bourbon.  One of the girls at the table who also ordered one didn't like it as much because she thought it was too sweet, but I thought it was really nicely balanced.    For my meal, I got the meatloaf sandwich... I was scared that I made a mistake on the first bite since it was just a crazy amount of Korean BBQ sauce, but that was not how the rest of the he sandwich was... Once the siracha mayo flavor came out, I was super happy.  I think I could have just bought a bottle of that and been happy!  I also LOVED the dressing on the little salad that was on the plate; I only wish there was more of the greens!    The waitress brought out dessert for my bday, and it was the perfect end to dinner.  The creme brûlée bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and toffee drizzle (my mouth is watering just typing that!) was just sweet enough without being overpowering!  There were a ton of other desserts that sounded scrumptious as well so I'd really like to explore that menu.  Welcome to university circle, Crop Kitchen! We're glad you're here"}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant ... They took the sushi and the blackboard menu out and you are left with sheer crap ... Let me repeat sheer crap menu ... What a mess ... Do yourself a favor ... Don't come and maybe someone else will open a good restaurant here ... Wow disappointing"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal at Crop Kitchen. Our server, Matthew, provided excellent advice as we made the difficult choices from among many flavorful Fall cocktails and delicious entrees. The shitake sesame mushroom soup was divine!  Curry chicken, pasta with roasted cauliflower sauce entrees were delicious, as were pumpkin creme brulee and the chocolate sweet potato trifle. Spacious seating, pleasant atmosphere, great service, nice assortment of options at various price points. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and had a good experience. They had a decent selection of beers available, and the happy hour apps were tasty. We got the truffle popcorn and he shishito peppers, both of which were very tasty! Only real complaint was that service was a little slow- there weren't too many people there, and it took a while for us to get our drinks after we ordered. We probably would've gotten another round of drinks if service was faster so we'd have more time to take advantage of the happy hour prices. Overall, not bad, but a little slow."}
{"text":"The Beef Udon Noodles! Oh man, the beef udon noodles. Seriously delicious. So far I'm not patient enough to wait an extra 30 seconds to take a nice photo of it because I see it and just need to eat it really fast. Also I really enjoyed the Soft Wedge Salad. It's a super classy start to the udon frenzy."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! I went with a group of 8 and we sampled a bit of everything. It was all fabulous. I got the pulled pork Mac n cheese to eat and I tried Christmas on Mars for my beverage. It was so good, i have never had anything like it, spicy and refreshing! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"With a couple of visits under our belt we feel comfortable encouraging others to give Crop Kitchen a try. There is a lot here, menu, chalkboard specials, sushi specials and drink specials. That makes this a perfect spot when one person is hungry and others want to graze and drink. In addition, the staff is knowledgeable and amiable. Is is a pleasure to eat here and it is well worth a try."}
{"text":"I must preface this by saying that the only reason this is a 3 star review and not a 2 star review is that I came for happy hour. If I'd paid regular price for the meal that I had I would have been pissed.  I came in at about 3:45, the restaurant is open for lunch through dinner which is nice considering a lot of places close up at 2 or 3 to reopen for dinner service. There were only 2 other parties in the whole place, which I chocked up to the weird time, but I thought there would be more people considering the location and they have happy hour.   Anyways. I came specifically for the happy hour, after checking the website I came after 3 because on the website it says the happy hour starts at 3:30PM. The sign out front said that happy hour started at 3PM. The bartender, who was apparently at the end of his shift, said that it started at 4PM. WHICH ONE IS IT CROP KITCHEN?? Since it was almost 4PM I shrugged it off and perused both the regular and happy hour menu.   As far as HHs go they have great deals, the discounts on food are fairly steep and they have a decent selection of beer and wine as well as half off well drinks. It WOULD be a go to if the execution was anywhere near what I would expect for a sister restaurant to Crop Bistro.  I ordered the single burger w/ bacon and a canned beer (21st Amendment Saison, which was the most fantastic part of my meal). The burger, while juicy and well cooked, was nothing special. The toppings which I can't remember off hand but sounded unique and flavorful were pretty bland and didn't really add much to the burger. The bun was straight up stale, which was surprising for obvious reasons.   They don't have fries, which seemed a little weird to me, but the serve all the sandwiches with a house salad and the side of the day. The side of the day happened to be wild rice salad, so I ended up with 2 salads. Both were pretty good for what they were, but both were weird accompaniment to the burger.   In total the bill came to 10.50 not including tax, but the burger (the regular burger is a double) is normally $14 and the beer is usually $5 or $6. I would have been very upset if I'd paid $20 bucks for something so mediocre. I've had better burgers at dive bars with better ambiance and decor. The service was also pretty nonexistent as well, though the bartender who took over was courteous I barely saw her.   The decor is weird, and the space looks like a really nice college cafeteria...  actually it looks like the cafeteria at my alma mater. It's a cheap imitation of Crop Bistro, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My experience here was not horrible, but I was honestly expecting WAY more. When I went, they were out of almost every single item my friend and I tried to order. The calamari was just eh. The deviled eggs are the bomb and I  could eat 100 of the wasabi ones, but other than that, just such a sub- par experience.   We had probably the most horrible server of all time.He had no clue what he was talking about when we asked questions, wasn't going to tell us the daily specials until we asked, never asked how anything was and when he gave us the check and we paid- just POOF, gone. No \"thank you,\" \"have a nice night,\" zip, zilch, nada. He was terrible and needed a lot more training before being put on the floor. So disappointing.   I would give it another shot, but man was I let down......"}
{"text":"Food was creatively designed and tasted delicious. Service was excellent. Enjoyed that staff from all areas of restaurant asked how my experience was. Coat check was a pleasant surprise. Plenty of space for groups. Lots of room for menu exploration. Pure water that wasn't just plain old tap water."}
{"text":"came here for dinner after an evening at the art museum. food was fabulous (had the vegetarian maki special) and the service was . no complaints whatsoever, very accommodating the vegetarians, great location great cocktails. would totally recommend"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice  now since they've opened.  There have been +'s and -'s both times.  This restaurant could really be a nice addition to the neighborhood and add some variety, but the cooks need to get their shit together in the kitchen.  First visit: got the salmon appetizer and rib-eye steak.  Salmon appetizer was tasty, had some nice flavors.  Steak had a nice char-grilled flavor, but was well-done when I ordered medium rare.  Regardless it was a tasty meal, and I felt it offered something different to the neighborhood.  Second visit: popped in for early dinner/happy hour.  Ordered sushi roll appetizer and the CK single hamburger.  First the bad... the sushi roll.  The rice was grossly under-cooked.  I was having to bite through hard grains of rice.  Brought it up to the staff, who really seemed disappointed I was disappointed.  I usually don't send food back to the kitchen unless it is something they can fix (i.e. not cooked enough) or it is completely inedible.  I didn't ask for the item to be removed, but I think in this case it would have been appropriate for the staff to take that off my bill, which they didn't, sadly.  On a good note, the hamburger was really nice.  Good flavor, juicy, and actually very satisfying for me even though it was only their half portion (1 meat patty instead of 2).  To top off the meal, ordered the sweet potato/chocolate desert... that was worth coming back for.  So, overall, restaurant has potential, but right now their cooks suck.  If they keep overcooking their steaks and under-cooking their sushi rice, they won't be selling much of either.  I will wait probably 6 months before coming back to this restaurant.  If my next visit isn't great, it will be my last."}
{"text":"All the hype made me try crop kitchen. It's a good location, complementary valet is a plus but I was there for dinner and I must say that part was mediocre at best. I ordered one of the pasta specials, the duck was kind of chewy. If I'm playing $20 for an entree I expect it to be a lot of food and might I add \"tasty\" I had to crane my neck to see what was on the specials board, some of the people I was with didn't eve bother with it and just ordered off the menu. Bottom line, try it once. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area a few days ago looking for a light meal, so we decided to check out Crop Kitchen for Happy Hour.  We decided to share the Black Bean and Tofu Burger ($6, HH pricing). I wasn't totally sure what to expect because while I've had a lot of veggie/soy/black bean burgers, I don't know that I've ever had one with tofu in it. Anyway, it was delish, and the texture was good (I sometimes find black bean burgers to be too soggy for my liking). It also came with a yummy side salad and potato salad. The salad dressing was especially good.  They had a decent selection of snacks, heavier fare, wine and beer at HH prices. They also had a few yummy sounding mixed drinks on special.  Our bartender was really awesome. Nothing on their dessert menu really caught our eye, so he recommended a few bakeries in the area to us. He then patiently gave us directions two or three times (we're not from the area and suck at not getting lost). The place he recommended was great, so we were very appreciative. Service during our meal was also fast."}
{"text":"Well I'll start with the fact that the price point could be lower or the food better. My experience is never that bad and I think it's because I don't eat meat. I've went 2 times now and each time my friends were pretty underwhelmed with there dishes.   Also, they have a chalk board menu that varies and there standard menu is pretty short. I've had the veggie burger and it was good. The burger came with a salad that was basically just lettuce and wild rice that could cut the roof of your mouth but the flavor was good.   I also enjoyed the calamari but it was pretty inconsistent. The first time I had it the portion size was great for sharing and it had a salad feel with the seaweed,  but the next time it was small with barely any seaweed. The flavor is great though."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. After living here for 5 years, this might be my all time favorite resturant.   Apps: pork belly bites are amazing. 5/5. Five deep fried pork belly chunks. Goat cheese dumplings are ok, not out of this world, but ok, had better.  Dinner: first off, the double patty ck burger is real solid. YOU MUST ASK FOR PERSIMMON BBQ SAUCE WITH IT. Of course, the buns are already delicious with aioli and the pattys are super tender. It does not come with fries, thank goodness! Instead it comes with 2 sides, a side salad and a side roasted potato, which goes so well with the persimmon sauce.  The  ribeye special is huge. My friend have up trying to finish it. So being the great friend i am, i ate it.  So good, so good. Sharing is caring.  The roasted bet salad is light, tastey and satisfying. I also ate this. I am not a glutton.  Heard the salmon app is good as well. At least the platter looks so pretty.  Woooohooo its a great resturant!! The best in the area hands down. Yipee!!"}
{"text":"I am a Crop fan but this one is not a winner in fact you should go anywhere but here if you are in the University Circle  area.  Our server was bubbly but forgetful, our drinks sounded better than they tasted and the food was fairly priced but just not good.  This place should close and rebrand as its not up to the Crop standards and is just hurting their downtown brand which is a must go."}
{"text":"Very good. Fresh and gourmet. We had pork tacos, sushi, wedge salad, tomato basil chilled soup. All were delicious! Nice atmosphere ... Especially on the outdoor patio. Wait staff were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"First.   After a long day. Matthew (our server) was a welcomed face!!! Service was amazing and the food was fabulous!!!! Perfect way to end a long day with an amazing ambience km the patio.  Thank you to Mathew and the entire crop kitchen staff for turning this frown upside down!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going on with the crop brand but things are not ok. We came for a Thursday evening meal and there were less than 20 people in the entire restaurant.  From walking in to actually getting food it took over an hour. We had to go to the bar and ask someone for our bill. Normally I would address this with a manager immediately but he was too busy hitting on a girl at the end of the bar to be bothered."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed, especially considering the other reviews. Will probably give a second chance. To begin with, the draft beers come with no explanation, all are unfamiliar which is great, but the waiter seemed unable to be of assistance in recommending anything as he was unfamiliar with the drafts as well. So I just got a bottle of Great Lakes. Oh well, not a big issue... But the inconsistencies continue. Next, I order the pasta special: Ohio City fettuccine, with a roasted tomato sauce, arugula, and shrimp. Although I typically do not like fettuccine, these noodles are fresh and flavorful. Nice! But where's the arugula? There is no arugula. Why do you list arugula and not put any? Too bad, arugula would've provided a nice balance to the somewhat overbearingly smoky sauce. The worst offender, however, is the shrimp. I understand cooking shrimp in the shell makes for more flavorful shrimp. Good. But if you're going to peel some of the shrimp, please peel all of the shrimp. There were about 5 prawns, some had half a shell, some had a whole shell, some had no shell. When the shrimp are covered with sauce, it's hard to tell which have a shell, and even harder to take the shell off.  Finally, the pasta special was listed at $22, but showed up as $25 on the check. I guess not having arugula or fully peeled shrimp adds value? The waiter remedied this, but come on.  My friends really liked most of what they ate. The meatloaf was apparently amazing. It's just too bad this place hasn't figured things out yet. When they do, should be pretty good."}
{"text":"To start off, their cocktail menu was very interesting as well as fairly pricey. When I questioned our waitress about the wine list, she clearly had not been well informed about their different types of wine and could not accurately answer my questions.  My salad and soup were both very tasty, however my white bean soup (which was about $11 dollars) couldn't have been more than 1/2 a cup. I would only expect this at a much higher-scale restaurant. My mom's fish was reportedly average. It was served on mashed potatoes which was a little strange, however she liked the mashed potatoes more than the fish so I guess it was a good surprise.  If they want to be considered worth their pricey menu, they should ramp up their cafeteria-like decor and improve the knowledge of their wait staff."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm so excited about this place. It's the perfect addition to the area- it feels like a \"nice\" place that would be in Ohio city/Tremont, is huge and great for groups (get those birthday plans going) yet cute enough for dates, and has very reasonable pricing.   We ordered a beer flight (yum), beef udon (not too impressed), and burger (good, standard). We also obviously got dessert because we always do, and the bread pudding was great.   While the food certainly didn't blow us away, there is a lot more to try on the menu and honestly the ambiance here is enough to warrant a great review. In an area filled with fast casual, this is the fun, trendy restaurant with an inventive menu to keep you happy on this side of town. I'll definitely be back and will update you fellow yelpers when I do. In the meantime, I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Last year we were so impressed with this place we returned as soon as we started our second trip to Cleveland. And again it was a great experience too. The only regret is that we didn't find the dishes with the hints of an Asian flavors in the new menu that we loved so much. Now the menu is strictly New American/Italian. But still what ever we ordered was very yummy and creative. We'll return on our every visit of Cleveland and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"What a great addition to University City.  Contemporary atmosphere.  Excellent food  and drinks.  The pork sandwich on challah bread was delicious.  The spring rolls were great.  The drinks and desserts are innovative.  This particular part of town does have steep competition with L'albatross and Washington Bistro nearby."}
{"text":"Crop Bistro had a baby and she's really cute!  Love the new location of Crop Kitchen. Uptown is quite the happening place these days. The place has a good trendy but casual vibe with a large bar and high ceilings, not to mention extremely friendly and attentive staff.   Four of us came here in November on a Wednesday night, so I'm sure the menu's changed a bit since then. They have a modest selection of wine and beer. We ordered the goat cheese dumplings to start. These were good but not wow, however I liked the added mushrooms. I ordered the cassoulet. It tasted like traditional cassoulet with a twist - a pork belly twist!! I love everything pork belly. The boneless thighs were a bit too fatty for my taste (if you know me well then you're probably shocked that I said something was TOO fatty). The dish itself was delicious - rich and savory and quite heavy as I ended up eating half of it the next day (still tasted good). A word of caution - it's pretty salty. I sampled a bit of everyone's entrees cause I'm greedy like that. My BFF ordered the warm kale salad - which was definitely my favorite of the night. It's a salad I would be happy to eat regularly, which doesn't happen often. The chicken curry rice was tasty but not amazing, but I did like the black rice that came with it. The udon noodles were okay.   Overall, I wasn't blown away by the food but it was definitely good, and cheaper than Crop Bistro. Service was great and I'll definitely be back for their happy hour. Can't beat the location!"}
{"text":"Do not get the warm salad...it was unbearably \"earthy\". However, the double decker burger was pretty good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place could have so much more potential but the cafeteria like setting and decor bring down the whole experience."}
{"text":"Someone said they seemed to mis spell their business name crop: replace 'o' to 'a'. That might be a little brutal but I agreed somehow in taste."}
{"text":"Flawless.  Appetizers - tried the wasabi deviled eggs and the calamari with seaweed and they were both wonderful.   As an entrée I had the steak and it was perfectly cooked, topped with truffle butter and with mashed potatoes and asparagus as sides.  The wine list is long and filled with several good wines to pair with the different entrées the restaurant has.   It's a great addition to the options in Uptown Cleveland."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for dinner after work on a friday. There is good and bad. First good, our appetizers were great! We got the goat cheese dumplings and chile deviled eggs. Second good, we got to eat outside. They have a pretty nice patio where you can enjoy some of the other night life going on. Third good, our server was SUPER NICE. Ok now on to the bad. My bf got the meatloaf sandwich. The meatloaf was decently tasty. But the hoagie it was on was really mediocre. Not a super good combination of flavors/textures. Second not so good, I got the tacos and they were a little dry and lacked some flavor. More pico de gallo and lime sour cream please! So anyway. Our apps were good, main course, not so much. So we gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Crop kitchen is a new favorite, for sure. I stopped in and enjoyed the free valet, cause parking in the area on a Friday night is a hassle. Excellent option. We had no reservation, so the only spot was at the bar overlooking the kitchen, lucky us! To make up for the view (which wasn't bad as all the food morsels looked amazing and the cooks seemed to be having fun) they have the sushi/cheese board specialist crack jokes to you, and she was really funny, and give you free cheese bites and rolls. Awesome experience.  And this is before I even get to the food! Get the pork belly app, it is amazing. I'm hesitant to call it sweet and sour sauce because of the cheap Chinese food image that conjures, but it is a sweet and sour and savory flavor that is like none other. In addition to the perfectly cooked morsels of unrendered bacon, it comes with some finely sliced veggies that work as healthier options to deliver the sauce to your mouth wondrously.   I got the burger, which was a hands down great Juicy burger on artisan bread, but after trying the other food and realizing the culinary expertise available, couldn't help regretting not splurging more. My girlfriend got the roasted pork with sweet potatoes, and it was phenomenal. Nice seared outside and pulled pork tender on the inside. Succulent.   But being a Wisconsinite, her favorite thing in the whole place was the aforementioned free cheese. They had max 365, a sharp cow cheese from Wisconsin that was some of the best cheese I've had, and a nice smoked cheddar. Getting the board and belly next time!   Oh, and it was pretty typical bar prices for food just as good as at their flagship \"crop bistro\" in Ohio city. Heaven sent, just wish they had this when I still lived in Coventry!"}
{"text":"This place needs to change its name.  I can't even really believe this place is associated with the other Crop.  And now that I know it is, there is a good chance I won't be going to the other Crop again either.  The story goes a little like this - 2 happy couples walk in and get a table...  Then they wait, and wait, and wait - and finally flag someone down for a drink.  We took advantage of the time we had to go through the small plates in detail and figured we should order while we had this guys attention.  We received our drinks and food - the drinks were good - except I ordered a Makers Mark Manhattan on the rocks - there was no garnish, and no bitters.  The appetizers came - everything was way under seasoned - everything needed salt.  We ended up being stuck for about 30 minutes - with nobody willing to take our order.  We needed drinks too.  Here we are, 4 young (35 is young, right?) professionals with american express cards ready to spend baby - yet we can't even get someone to take our order.  Finally we flag a server down, he takes order for another round of drinks and dinner.    Dinner - was the worst.  My gal ordered the tempura cod sandwich - which should be renamed the tempura cod sashimi sandwich.  It was gross, undercooked mess.  I ordered the burger, which was again under seasoned and over cooked.   Our friends meals were also just blah.  Talk about disappointing...  So, I had to talk to the GM or whoever was running this place.  I ask the server to get him - he comes over.  It was very clear he was in way over his head and lacked experience.  Someone he knows must own the place.  I explained to him our experience, he listened, but really did not know how to handle the situation.  He took off the sandwich off our bill - and offered to buy us a round of drinks and left - but he never told anyone to come over and take care of us.  Instead he went back and yelled at our server who then took it out on us by walking by and avoiding eye contact with us.  It was the strangest thing ever.  Then I see the manager sitting at the bar drinking and eating with a girl - while we are stuck waiting for a check.  We paid the bill and walked - and I had a long internal argument in my mind if I should call american express to dispute the charge."}
{"text":"I love this place's partner restaurant in Ohio City, so I had to come check it out for their grand opening!  Basically, this restaurant is like a mini version of Crop Bistro, in that it offers appetizers, salads and main courses very similar to those at the main Crop restaurant (and at similar prices).  The difference is that it also offers a selection of sandwiches, which are priced ~$10-12.  We had the spring roll appetizer, which was pretty good, but needed the dipping sauce for enough flavor.  We also tried the Pig Mac, which is a play on the Big Mac except with three different types of pork (pulled pork, cutlets and bacon) instead of beef.  We also had the CK double double burger, which is your more typical burger.  Both were very tasty, especially the Pig Mac! They were also decently-sized and came with couscous and salad.  The service was not bad, considering that the restaurant just opened.  They did bring the wrong food out to us, but they caught their mistake before we had a chance to tell them.  The decor is modern and very different from Crop Bistro.  On the way out we noticed there was a little bar area with a pool table.  All in all, the restaurant lives up to the Crop name!"}
{"text":"We had an incredible dinner and waiter. Ask for Matthew as he was a fantastic waiter and gave wonderful suggestions and service!"}
{"text":"Food scene in Cleveland has produced some great places to eat. This is one of them. Located close to Case Western, not only the food and draft beer list exceeds expectations, but the environment and service do as well. Portions are adequate and GF options are available."}
{"text":"This is an awesomely affordable spawn from the food Gods of Crop, in Ohio City.  A group of us went here before seeing a show at the Cedar Lee. Their menu mainly consists of Asian and Southern soul food. My sister got an Udon noodle dish, while I got the Pig Mac, which was loaded with Pork, Bacon, Pork, and BACON. Obviously, this put all other pork sandwiches to shame. Everything at our table was above expectations. To get some veggies in out diet, we ordered Shishito Peppers to start, which came with ginger salt. It's the little flavor additions like the touch of ginger in this salt that really make Crop's food special.   Oh, and of course I got a cocktail. The Mr. Figgy. Served at Crop as well, this is on the top of my list of favorite drinks. Draped with luscious candied bacon, it serves as a nice amuse-bouche.  If I lived on the East side, I would be a regular at this joint."}
{"text":"Had a terrific casual meal at Crop Kitchen. Fried chicken sandwich was yummy as were the ribs. Great value, good service. Maybe they can dampen the sound down a little because it did get a little loud. But there was a great, happy vibe and we'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"If you don't want to faint from sticker shock at Crop Bistro, Crop Kitchen is a nice alternative. You'll probably average about $10-$15 less per person at Crop Kitchen. I came here with a large group of friends and had a fantastic time, mostly because the ambiance is perfect for a faux-fancy night out with buddies!  The service was unbeatable with informed and funny waitresses, totally armed to deal with the never-ending-questioners-about-menu people in my group and the vegetarian and vegan folks' requests.   I enjoyed that the daily specials were projected high up on a chalkboard. I've always hated listening to waiters go on and on about daily specials--who has that kind of attention span to listen to every spice and garnish used in a dish? I'm a bigger fan of reading the specials for myself.   As for the food, it was pretty darn good. I had the Fire Roasted Uku special of the night. This fish was FREAKIN AMAZING. It came with lentils and tomatoes soaked in a coconut curry. DELISH! The fish was pretty mild, so it's perfect for those that don't like strong fishy flavors. The curry was the perfect balance between sweet and savory, and the portion size was just right. Definitely a hit! I also sampled some of the eggnog bread pudding that a friend ordered and thought it was creamy and decadent. Definitely wished I had ordered it too!   The only reason I'm not shelling out 5 stars is because my drink, the Uptown Punch, was just a downright disaster. I was expecting coconut and pineapple flavors and instead was greeted with a heavily alcoholic concoction with little to no flavor. Somebody was extremely heavy handed at the bar that night!!   Overall, the food, ambiance, and service were pretty darn good. I'll be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Delightful staff, lovely outdoor patio set away from the street, great location right off campus,  large portions, tasty in-house soda, nice commitment to seasonal and local fare, creative menu with delicious food and without pretensions.  I recommend the homemade veggie burger (very filling) and the eggplant app (fried fresh and served with flavorful sauces).  I hear there is Thursday-night music. We shall be returning."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Cocktails are bad. Service is good. I would not recommend this place. The staff was courteous and the service was fine however the taste of the food was just absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The meatloaf was a tad on the salty side but it wasn't distracting. The beer list is also awesome. Our server was very friendly and offered helpful suggestions. The sweet potato and chocolate dessert was surprisingly delicious. The atmosphere is also quite nice and the prices are reasonable for what you get. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the uptown area during one of those outdoor festivals.  The Crop Kitchen had a table at the event and advised me that happy hour was going to go on all night at their restaurant.  I thought it would be a perfect chance to try the place out.  Pros:    The patio area is absolutely beautiful.  Great place to hang out and people watch on a    summer night.  The sangria was amazing and during happy hour it is just 5$.  The service wasn't bad at all.  The waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable.  All other service staff that refilled our waters and took away empty plates were pleasant.  Cons:  I ordered a well done burger and it came out burnt. I suppose Crop is one of those places that equates well done to burnt.  The salad that came  with my meal was literally just lettuce and the wild rice was room temperature at best.   In order to alleviate my hunger I decided to send the burger back and order a medium well one.  I pretty much closed my eyes and ate it because I don't like that much pink in my burger.  The burger was OK.  The salad that came with my replacement burger not only had lettuce but there was dressing and some other toppings.  The rice was cold...ice cold.  I asked a server if I my rice should be cold and he assured me that it should have been but I am not convinced considering the first serving was room temperature.  We also tried the calamari as an appetizer.  It was a little to salty for my taste.  I might revisit Crop during happy hour for a sangria but I will get my food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Crop Kitchen was a horrible and terrifying experience. As someone with a severe food allergy, I take extreme caution when I dine out. After alerting the waitress of my peanut and nut allergy - she came back to tell us that they might cook in peanut oil. Might, is not an acceptable answer. She then brought the chef out who assured us that my food did not contain the food I am deathly allergic too. He assured me the dish I planned on ordering for my main course was also safe. When my meal came, I took a bite only to have a family member with me discover there was a nut in my dish. I immediately spit out the food and luckily was okay. When we franticly wanted to speak with the chef he claimed it was oversight and miscommunication understanding what kind of allergies I have. His \"mistake\" could have cost me my life. I write this post to let other people with severe food allergies that this restaurant could not have been less attentive to my allergies. Please don't make the same mistake as I made."}
{"text":"Crop Kitchen is a nice addition to the University Circle area.  Now, this isn't the same level as Crop, but I like how it adds a different flair to the area.  I've always been a fan of Crop. So when I heard there was going to be a different style of Crop in the same place where Accent was- well, just had to go!  There's been some good and bad items I've tried, but it's overall been good: - Green Tea Soba Noodles- tasty and the noodles are cooked well. Flavorful and light. I didn't think I would like them, but I actually really did. - Orange Miso Popcorn- not really a fan. It was definitely orange-y. I rather have the balsamic popcorn at Crop actually. - Smoked Braised Pork- wow, this is great dish. The meat was tender and the sauce was just delicious. Recommend! - Chicken Curry Rice- well cooked and well done. However, just didn't think there was much to it. I did like the black rice though. - Beef Udon Noodle- it was good. I thought it was a bit pricey for what it was, but it was good. - Cedar Planked salmon- also very good. It was a special of the night, but it was definitely tasty. - Baked Apple Drink- no. Way too strong. Not sure if they dumped a whole bottle in there, but I felt like I was about to be lit on fire. Could have just been that night though. - Microbrews- nice selection!  So, overall, I still give the place four stars. It's nice, has a large variety of food, and can please any crowd- to the daters, to the people who want to watch sports and play pool, to the people who are just interested in happy hour.   Park in the parking lot behind CLE Yoga though- it's free after 5pm. Definitely try Crop Kitchen-it's a nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. Nice hours for happy hour - 3:30-6:30pm, perfect for those who end work a bit later. They also take reservations for happy hour! Free valet parking. Nice options for seating - if you have a group, there are high top individual tables so you don't have to cluster around the bar. The downside is the happy hour menu isn't that much cheaper than the regular menu. We ordered beers - $3.50 - had the option of a brown sugar IPA and cider - cider is light and refreshing although bf thought it was watered down - IPA was nice as well with hops. Ordered tater tots with pulled pork from the happy hour menu - expected actual fried tater tots but these are soft sweet potatoes instead - pulled pork was nice as well - nice flavors but not blown out of the water - good deal for $5. Also ordered the pork spring rolls - 8 small pieces for $6? It was good, light, but nothing overwhelmingly impressive. All four of us each got the CK single patty burger for $6 - good deal - 1/4lb patty and comes with two sides - house spring salad with balsamic dressing and potato salad. Burger was average. The sides were average. Overall, food was good but nothing impressive. 5 stars for the service (seating, happy hour hours, free valet parking), 2 stars for limited menu, and 3.5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"I have been to Crop twice. The first time I went for happy hour and I really was not that impressed. Happy hour prices were great, but the food was bland. I decided to give Crop another try before I reviewed, I went for dinner, and still was not that impressed.  Some of the items on their menu are really good, and some of the items on their menu are not. Presentation is the most appealing part about the food in this restaurant. Dinner prices are average for a upscale farm to table establishment. One thing I did really enjoy was their fresh juices/soda.  Both times I went they were hosting events near the area by the bar/pool tables/bathrooms. There is no separate area for this so it becomes extremely noisy in the main indoor dining area when they are hosting events. Mixed feelings to say the least, not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"The slowest service on the planet.  Our group of 10 was only able to order one round of drinks because it took a half hour to get our first round. Also took forever to get our food.  I would not recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"A cool vibe in a cool part of town, but the food just wasn't there, not for the price. The black bean tofu burger was bland and such a mess I never got to pick it up once.  The daily ramen special (bacon, mussels, okra, egg) was super-yummy. The sushi was just OK.  I just think that, in this price range, everything should be top-notch.  $70 for three lunches (no drinks, no desserts) exclusive of tip.  I give them this: we were not rushed and allowed to sit and talk as long as we liked."}
{"text":"Rebecca was amazing at assisting with my lunch group!  She allowed us to order ahead, planned our seating arrangements, and everything was ready when my group showed up.  Our server was helpful, and accommodating to one of our late co-workers.  Have I mentioned how terrific the food was? OMGosh!!! The food was amazing! I strongly recommend planning any meal with them."}
{"text":"Great little place to add to the options near the university.  And happy to have a fine-dining option in addition to the French place near-by.  It's a slightly more casual/comfortable kind of fine-dining option.  The food is fantastic, and on par with some of the best in town.  But the mood is casual, comfortable, chalk board specials, walk-in wearing jeans, grab some great food/drinks, and chat it up with friends -- kind of place.  I got the ribeye special, it was well cooked, seasoned nicely, served with a porcini mushroom sauce. He got the chicken cassoulet - came with sausage, pork belly, and beans.  Both dishes were very good.  We ordered pear tarte for dessert, and it was warm, sweet, melt-in-my-mouth yumminess, and came with a scoop of melting vanilla ice cream.  Great meal, we'll definitely be back.  And service was top notch on this blistering cold and snowing night... even though I brought in a huge puddle of snow/water into the restaurant with me, and we didn't get out until 45 minutes after closing.  They were consistently courteous, spot-on with regard to the amount of attention, and quick to replace a glass of wine that had gone bad.  Not their fault -- wine often does go bad whether it's from sitting in an open bottle, or due to less than optimal conditions during shipping/storage.  Either way, everything about the night was perfect -- except the crazy snow storm outside.   ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear this had opened in Uptown. I was there a day or two after it opened to get the CK Burger and loved it. The drinks are great (Sleepy Hollow and New Fashioned). I highly recommend the New Fashioned and Mr. Figgy. One of my girlfriends was thrilled to find her favorite white wine on the menu and said it isn't usually on many menus. The food is consistently good (goat cheese dumplings, deviled eggs with pickled ginger, chicken cassoulet, the tofu and portabello sandwich with outstanding potato salad, strawberry sorbet and holé molé ice cream). Not as impressed with the sushi. The veggie tempura sushi was bland (and I had ordered a California roll but the server mixed up my to go order), and spicy tuna roll was just ok. I have been enjoying eating my way through the menu. The servers are personable and really friendly. The kitchen consistently turns out great food. Welcome to the neighborhood, Crop Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu choices where even the finicky eater can find something delicious. Great wait staff, attentive and helpful. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food is so-so. The menu is pretty bland and everything has a smokey taste to it. We tried the mussels, goat cheese dumplings, and some of the main entrées and everything taste the same. Service was pretty bad too- our waitress didn't know what she was doing. It is a little pricey too."}
