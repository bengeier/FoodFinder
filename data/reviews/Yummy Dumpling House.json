{"text":"A very small, casual spot with a short, 1/2-page menu that serves mostly dumplings.
Prices are not bad, averaging at about $8 for 15 plump dumplings with two or three filling options.  If you keep your expectations in check, it's an OK spot to drop in if you're in for a quick and cheap dumplings meal."}
{"text":"The pork wonton $4.99 you get 10 pieces of wonton in a nice broth! Home made and perfect size. I don't like my wonton too big, a good portion of shrimp and pork. Whether it's a hot winter day craving for dumplings or a soup after work. One of my favourite dumplings in the GTA. 

The owners are so friendly. I always come here when I crave for dumplings! This is another one of those hidden gem that you might find it that you like it so much and don't want to tell anyone!"}
{"text":"A great local family runned business! Parking and seating, and ventilation in the small restaurant is a bit challenging, but this is certainly made-up by quality ingredients and food. It's great they have a small/limited menu, which really creates focus and consistency in what they cook. Great to see and find a quality dumpling joint that's not all the way in Scarborough or Markham. Lastly, I didn't check or confirm, but I think the restaurant also sells frozen takeout options, which is a plus. A definite return option for those who enjoy a quick, simple, and local dumpling option in North York area!"}
{"text":"Very neat and clean restaurant! I sat near the kitchen and got to see how the staff cook the food. Surprisingly, all of them wear gloves, continuously clean the kitchen, and always use tools when handling food. The food was okay and there is not much selection on the menu. The place only takes cash and debit (with minimum $10 of purchase)."}
{"text":"I tried the Chinese cabbage and pork dumplings and potato slices with chili sauce. I thought it was pretty good. I kind of wish there was either more Chinese cabbage or a little less ginger as out of the 15 I ate, I probably really tasted 2 or 3 dumplings with that distinctive flavour of Bok Choy. Nevertheless, it was still good. The potato slices I had really enjoyed, it was a really hot day that day and it really cooled me down. I loved the sourness from the vinegar."}
{"text":"An excellent place for dumplings and soup! The dumplings were indeed yummy and filling. We ordered 2 wonton soups- the serving size was bigger than I expected, pork fried dumplings, chicken fried dumplings, and the green onion pancake. Everything was fantastic and was served piping hot. You can watch your food being prepared in the kitchen. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Good pork dumplings 
Wanton soup is good. Highly recommend the seaweed garlic salad and the chefs special pork and Chinese cabbage dumplings 

Service is extremely good. Great for quick and tasty food"}
{"text":"It's a very small scale restaurants, easy to order and pick up if you live nearby. The taste and and the size of the dumplings are among the average. Overall it's a good option when you need a convenient and quick meal."}
{"text":"Great place for quick dinner and lunch. Always packed at rush hour. The owner runs the restaurant, very friendly and nice people. The food is great. Some people might find it a bit authentic. But definitely good for Northern Chinese dumplings. Excellent price for the amount of food. I believe everything is handmade. The place is small so take out is more convenient."}
