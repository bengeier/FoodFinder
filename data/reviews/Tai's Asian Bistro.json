{"text":"Came in on a Friday night. Not many people. Ordered at the counter & sat down at a table. Food was served very quickly & brought out right when it was ready. Food quality was excellent. Crab Rangoon was light & crispy. Sushi was fresh. General tsos chicken was very good. Pad tai was fresh & you could taste all the distinct flavor a of peanut, lemon, & spice. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now because my coworkers like it.  The portions are huge, but the food is icky-blah.  Skip it."}
{"text":"IMHO the best House Lo Mein in the area. Love the food, the service and the price!"}
{"text":"This was a go to when I worked in the neighborhood. Love the dinner special- a good price for lots of items."}
{"text":"Came here under the recommendation of a friend who's been here a couple of times. From my experience with Asian eateries I know it can swing two ways, but this place serves good Chinese food. We ordered from the 'Family Dinner' menu. This list really caters to the family, they have selections ranging from 3 to 6(?), might be more, dishes, depending on the size of your 'family'. So with that you get a choice of what you love to try.   Food is decent enough. I love their spicy chicken wings in claypot. Note: The wings are not the boneless wings, something to keep in mind if you want to save some hassle during your meals. But most Chinese places serve traditional wings, and I love them. Our next dish was a stir-fry green vegetable. Tasted fine, not much to say for this classic. We also had the steamed fish. The selling point of steamed fish is to preserve the 'natural' taste and texture of the fish, for that reason you need to use fresh ingredients to make it work well. Unfortunately they fell a little short in this aspect. That said, though, it's not easy to get fresh seafood in town, so I give them some credit.   At Tai's you place your order and pay upfront at the counter. You go take a seat at your table and they will bring the food out once they are ready. Pretty easy and efficient system. Sometimes when they are busy, they might tend to look around a little before spotting your table. So keep an eye out for the items you ordered, and give them a shout-out if you see them with it.  One comment I have is that their atmosphere in terms of ventilation needs some improvement. They have an open kitchen concept, so the kitchen is completely open to the dining space. As you can imagine with the amount of stir-frying and stuff going on, the smell of food and spices can get pretty strong. Though it might be cool to watch you food being prepared, at times it could be a little too overwhelming for me and my clothes."}
{"text":"Best beef and broccoli I've ever had! Good seasoning and texture is what you would want it to be. Service is fast as it is made to order. Cute dining area too"}
{"text":"Three stars is fitting for this place. Nothing was excellent, the prices were reasonable, the service was okay, though I thought the interior was far nicer than a \"hole in the wall diner\" as described in some other reviews. It's really a clean, moderately nice Asian restaurant (not so common I suppose). Nonetheless, it's a good lunch spot for a cheap and filling meal, but the quality is not supreme nor are the prices the cheapest you'll find.  Bonus: They have an authentic Chinese menu, though none of them are listed on the lunch specials, so you will have to pay a little extra."}
{"text":"really authentic chinese food!!     I mean the place is not fancy, but price is really reasonable. Their food is the best i ve tried in madison, it reminds me of homemade chinese food :p"}
{"text":"From a Chinese perspective, this restaurant tastes OK, but I have to say it's the best tasting Chinese restaurant in Madison, that why I'm giving five stars."}
{"text":"My roommates and I love this place! Their hot n sour soup is really good and I really like their steamed dumplings and fried rice. They're super nice and quick when you call for take out. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The ingredients are very fresh and plentiful and the prices very affordable. Thais spicy chicken was excellent as was the won ton soup. The egg roll was greasy with only bean sprouts and carrots in it. Sometimes it's totally orange inside. It could use some chicken or pork or some other flavors. Portions are huge. Other menu items we've had have been good also but certainly not outstanding-I can't even remember their names. We've been there at least 5 or 6 times so far."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced FRESH Asian food.  I usually have the lettuce wrap and spicy wantons.  I have also tried the chicken and mushrooms which is full of fresh vegetables.  The best part is you get a lot of food for your money.  I always have enough for at least two meals."}
{"text":"Decent place. Good food and prices. Only bummer is that they don't do deliveries anymore.  I've been to this place more than 10 times. And I have to say, every time has been a nice experience. Their food is always authentic, and the workers seem nice as well.  Would recommend this place to anyone who wants a taste of authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I am here at least twice a week. Most dishes are authentic and prices are VERY reasonable. The staff is friendly as well. Recommendations include the crispy chicken, szechuan spicy fish (this might not be on the menu), clams in black bean sauce, flounder home style, drunk ginger spare ribs, stir fried pea tips."}
{"text":"Could not be happier I decided to give this place a try. The only reason I did not come earlier was because there is a lot of ethnic food in the area with better ratings on Yelp. However, don't let this place's 3.5 star rating fool you, this is place is a solid 5 stars.  If you come here, you can expect more food, more flavor, and a lower price than any other ethnic restaurant nearby. And if you decide to eat in, the interior of the restaurant is surprisingly modern and clean. And while some people have complained that this place is \"Americanized\", I would have to respectfully disagree to an extent. Yes there is a tad bit more oil and sugar in some dishes than an authentic Chinese dish, but this place uses nowhere near the amount of grease or sugar as the truly Americanized Panda Express. I actually feel good after eating this stuff! ...and besides, who said Americanized automatically meant bad? ;)  Anyway, this place has become my new go to place for lunch and dinner when I am in the area. I would highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant yesterday while shopping in the Whitney Way area in Madison, WI.  Great food at reasonable prices. We had Sushi and shrimp tempura. This is informal dining where you order your food at the counter. You can see the cooks/chefs making the food right there. Their menu is extensive."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town. The typical Americanized stuff is better than basically anywhere in town and the more traditional dishes really shine through. The Japanese is competent as well and I enjoy getting bento boxes with a Chinese dish as the main item.  Tasty, inexpensive, and unpretentious; it has been consistently good every time I've eaten there over the last several years."}
{"text":"This place does not get the credit it deserves. First of all, if you're looking for a fast food American Chinese (General's Tso, etc) greasy, type restaurant, then this is not the place for you.   Ambiance is not great and of course service is so-so, what do you expect out of an Asian place, but the food is one of the better options for Chinese food in Madison, as there are not many.   What other place can you order a special for 2 and stay under $20 for dinner. Also, there is a hugeeeeeee variety to choose from. You can order dumplings, to Korean short ribs, to noodle soups, to an amazing steamed fish. If you're ordering the usual thing you can get at a fast food Chinese place, go some place else. If you don't know what to order - look around you at the other Asians.   Each visit is enjoyable. BTW, did I mention that the portions are huggge! Best deal, great prices, and anything to choose from."}
{"text":"We arrived into town at about 9 pm, too late to be served at one Asian restaurant that was closing a little earlier than we thought.  Someone at that restaurant (we weren't sure if they were simply eating there or were connected to the management) recommended Tai's as the place they go to for Chinese food.  An unassuming storefront, but boy was the food good!  Highly but subtly spiced just the way we like it.  Had the salt and pepper calamari, eggplant in garlic sauce, and spicy beef, and all were memorable.  Worth the stop!  We'd definitely come back if in Madison."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice! Definitely does the trick every time. Great value overall."}
{"text":"Great food and cheery, helpful counter staff. Decor is nothing special - plasticky and serviceable. Give your order at the counter and sit down. Big screen tv above eating area. Your clothes will smell a little fried after eating in. I'd advise takeout."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Restaurant in Madison  I've eaten at Tai's Asian Bistro at least 20 to 30 times in the past year and have never had a meal that was less than good.  I recommend Tai's Spicy Chicken - crispy thin strips of white meat in a light but crispy breading (might be deep fried, but it's crispy, not greasy and nothing like the  thick, heavy, spongy, and oil-laden breading one often encounters on General Tso's or sweet-and-sour chicken), in a slightly sweet, slightly salty, garlicy spicy sauce that is excellent, a perfect blend of its component tastes.  The pork lo mein is also terrific with lots of pork and vegetables, and the Singapore Chicken, the Sichuan Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken are all very tasty.  I like the fact that they allow substitutions of ingredients and will make the dishes extra spicy; the lo mein, in particular, tastes excellent extra spicy.  All vegetables are very fresh, as well, and are usually cooked perfectly, no raw, but still fresh and crispy, not overcooked and mushy as they often turn out to be in mediocre Chinese restaurants.  Service has been good, except for a few communication problems with, surprisingly, the one behind-the-counter employee who might be a native English speaker, who has nearly screwed up my orders several times. I guess I've become a regular with the more regular counter employees, though, who have welcomed me with a smile and ask \"The usual?\" (i.e. Tai's Spicy Chicken with broccoli substituted for the usual zucchini, which, incidentally, I recommend requesting).  I've never had the sushi there, but they seem to have a good selection.  I've seen several noodle dishes brought out to tables of Asian customers that looked excellent.  In summary, I think this is a terrific Asian restaurant.  It doesn't have the best Chinese dish in town (that honor goes to Happy Wok's Double Cooked Chicken), but second-best is still outstanding, and everything there that I've had is very good to excellent."}
{"text":"Friendly help, fast service, many choices--too many actually--jack of all asian trades, master of none, so to speak.    I get nervous ordering raw fish  from any restaurant with a dirty floor and filthy windows.  Prices match other places with table service and non plastic utensils--so why not have a better experience? Oil may not have been hot enough, got quite the tummyache afterward from the grease of the tempura.  The takeout options seem to appeal to the young crowd."}
{"text":"Good food here, this place knows how to make good asian food and in my opinion,  makes the best crab ragoon in the city"}
{"text":"This place has your standard fare and much more. For such a small establishment, I was impressed by how many things they had on their menu, including sashimi and whole flounder. It was mostly hit-or-miss -- ordering sashimi at a place like this will get you exactly what you would expect: not super fresh, but not rancid either. I had another dish that was essentially fried pork ribs in a sweet, garlicy sauce, which wasn't bad. I liked their tofu and veggie dish a lot, but then again, it's also pretty ordinary. For the price, you could do much worse.  One real exception: their bubble tea is TERRIBLE -- they heat the bubbles in the microwave so they end up really chewy and almost crunchy in the middle. Understandably so, it's not their specialty, but they charge you as much as a real boba tea place, if not a little more."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Everything I've had was flavorful and just the right portion.  Their Pad Thai is a bit off from other restaurants, since the noodles are not the traditional style. Some liberties are taken on some other dishes as well, but none of them taste bad. I've come to prefer their take on everything.   Also, the staff is friendly. It's a family running the place and they treat you like a guest in their home. They will hand you the remote to the TV if you're the only one there at the time.   Their kitchen is well kept. It's always a good sign when the whole kitchen is visible from the dining room.   Lastly, their lunch specials are a great deal. Good food for less than $10 wins me over evey time."}
{"text":"Service is very good. They helped suggestions when I asked and didn't rush me while I stood at the counter trying to decide. Once ordered, the food comes out super fast. I witnessed a table of two getting their food right after they sat down. Yes, super fast!!   Food wise, I don't know. I have a hard time debating between a 2-3 star rating. This was my first time there, and I wanted to try a couple of dishes but as I was there by myself I opted for just two entrees. I ordered the spicy chicken with the help of their suggestion, a bowl of beef pho at the suggestion of another customer in line, and a coconut bubble tea. I got the bubble tea relatively quickly and I can still see clumps of coconut powder in my drink. I mixed it up a bit more and I took one sip of it. It was just not to my liking and set it aside. Next, I got my pho bowl and I don't even know what to say. It had absolutely no taste, not even salt. It tasted like a bowl of large noodles and basil in hot water. In my attempt to make it more edible, I added soy sauce and sriracha but that didn't do much. I was so tempted to go up and ask for fish sauce (they never came back to ask how it was) but decided to wait for my next entree instead. The spicy chicken came out last and it was the complete opposite of my pho bowl. Although the chicken pieces seem fresh and crispy, it was drenched in an overwhelmingly salty sauce. I picked through the chicken in search of the few pieces of zucchini to help tone down the flavor. The white rice that came with it soaked up a lot of the sauce so that didn't help. After finishing the four/five pieces of zucchini and I got tired of wiping off the sauce from the chicken, I gave up. I ended up dumping everything in the trash.   I really didn't want to rate this place so low, but it was a disappointing lunch. I should have just stayed at the mall and eaten the food at the food court."}
{"text":"Amazing home style Chinese food! The crispy chicken is so juicy yet crispy. I honestly dream about this chicken. The food comes out super fast and is very well priced. I'm still thinking about how delicious that chicken was."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the positive reviews.  Thought maybe we'd get something other than typical Americanized Chinese food.  Unfortunately, no, and the food was so salty that we could not finish it."}
{"text":"My preferred choice for Chinese on the West Side. It's not the best ever, but it gets you inexpensive lunch with sizable portions.  If you're ordering from them, stick to the Chinese dishes. The rest is okay but...uh.. stick to the Chinese dishes. I particularly love the Fish with Eggplant, the Crispy Fish, and the Braised Beef with Tofu."}
{"text":"After trying several other Chinese-style restaurants in Madison, I have to say for the price this is as good as it gets. There are other places that might have more authentic options and style, but they tend to be pricier with not much value added. Tai's Asian Bistro is a bit more modern than traditional, but it totally gets street cred for the sticky tables and consistently hard-working staff.   Come with several friends and order family-style, roughly one dish per person, that way you can play duck duck goose with your food. Ma po tofu, Singapore noodles, sesame chicken, GOOSE!  Disclaimer: their regular menu has neither ducks nor geese, but apparently they do serve Peking duck if you give them advanced notice."}
{"text":"The Chinese food here is among the best Madison has to offer. Order from the family style menu because it is much more authentic. The atmosphere is very casual and almost looks like a hole in the wall diner. However, the food more than makes up for this. I highly recommend if you're in mood for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"We stumbled in here knowing nothing about this place.  We happened to be in the area and the kids and I were starving.  I wasn't quite sure how ordering went - there's a counter and large poster like menu, and stack of takeout menus, but also a ton of tables that made it look like a full service restaurant.  Honestly, I still have no clue.  We went up to the register and ordered - lettuce wraps and chicken lo mein.  Both were great!  The noodles stood out and my kids devoured them.  I also noticed a small sushi bar but I saw no menu.  All in all - a good, well priced place.  I'm not in that area often, but I wouldn't hesitate to head back in if I was."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Madison WI is not a place of Chinese gastronomy. Coming from a much larger city, I know great Chinese food. Tai's is one of the few fairly good places here. On the plus side, the food is good and is brought to the table piping hot. Also, the staff is always friendly. Negatives: Despite lots of dining tables, the place (like most Madison Chinese) is not \"eat in friendly\". Bowls of food are often served without serving spoons. We almost always have to hunt down serving spoons, and the ones available are only tablespoon size. Also, there are numerous menu versions (three I've seen), making ordering a confusing experience even for repeat customers. No one menu has the complete offerings. If take-out Chinese is your thing (Madisonians seem overwhelmingly a take-out crowd), this might be the place for you. I value a good dining experience. Unfortunately, Tai's falls short here, hence I knock my rating down a star."}
{"text":"So my friends and I went back and ordered a slew of food, mostly chinese, korean and a plate of sushi. Not bad, better than expected."}
{"text":"Drunk. Ginger. Flounder. IMO this is one of the best dishes in Madison. A wonderful sweet sauce with a perfectly fried whole fish covered in garlic and cilantro. Crispy fish corners with tender juicy insides. Goes perfect with a bowl of white rice.   Tai's is an unassuming spot on the westside in one of those strip malls that don't seem to get much traffic. Honestly the drunk ginger flounder is enough to make my mouth water and get me in the car to come out here. But they have other really delicious dishes too like their roast duck and steamed seabass.  If you are looking for nice garlic-y dishes, affordable pan-Asian (mostly Chinese) food, and a full belly....this is the place."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Their menu is saturated with deliciousness and it's incredibly easy to find something for everyone. I love their eel sushi... YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Tai's Asian Bistro offers a potpourri of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine (I may be missing some other ethnicities on this list). They aren't necessarily good and won't leave you with a wowing impression, but if you're stuck in Madison, you can't complain. Plus, when you're with a group of people that can't decide what kind of Asian food you want to get, you get to choose which Asian goodness you want to indulge in at Tai's Asian Bistro.   This place offers affordable items on the menu and their lunch and dinner specials are worthy of note. However, I wouldn't recommend the sushi here. In addition, based on my food-tasting experience here, it seems that the Chinese dishes are the most authentic (i.e. they taste like the food from restaurants that specialize in Chinese food). The other ethnic dishes are okay, but definitely tastes a little off from other restaurants that specialize in making those ethnic dishes.   All in all, at Tai's Asian Bistro, you'll find all assortments of Asian food and discover varying levels of how they'll taste."}
{"text":"This place needs a little more love.   Located in one of the most empty strip mall in Madison, you would not expect authentic and good food by its appearance. But they do. Not the best Chinese place around, but a solid choice for the west side. The main draw for me is the incredibly low price.   My suggestion is sticking to the \"Family Dinner\" section on the their menu (the section with ABC combinations). You can get three decent entree dishes with $25. A very good deal. I recommend the fish dishes.   Now there's A-Mart in the same plaza, Hy-Vee across the street, drop by this place and give it a try."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite at 3 p.m. on a Friday. It was my first time there and the staff was very friendly. I ordered the spring rolls and hot and sour soup. Then I saw the sign for bubble tea and since I never had one before, added a Thai tea one to my order. The soup was outstanding with big pieces of tofu and large chunks of mushrooms. The spring rolls were nice too. Light and fried, but not greasy. And the bubble tea? I am now a believer! It's was not only tasty, but fun to slurp those tapioca balls up through the fat straw. I will definitely be back again for one of those babies! I also can't wait to try their other starters and full dishes. Great place."}
{"text":"Tai's bistro has been long time favorite of mine since I moved to Madison.  I always took out never ate in there.I usually order family dinner to go.  I can pick from various options and reasonably priced.  The food quality is very good and consistent.  This is well above average Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"We bought two dinner box specials and a thai tea bubble tea. Firstly, the bubble tea was mediocre. It was too sweet and some of the bubbles were undercooked and some were overcooked. The pad thai was not even pad thai. The noodles were pink and was very soupy. The pad thai didn't even taste like pad thai. My sauce at home is better. The sushi was basic California roll but the avocado was greying. In addition, the fried rice was in chunks but it was okay if you put a lot of Sriracha on it. But it was the best thing in the box, along with the crab rangoon which was average. The sesame chicken was what you could get at any fast food joint. The salad was drenched in \"Italian\" dressing and felt like I was eating at McDonald's. Overall, the Sriracha was good and allowed me to consume the products. Not worth $10."}
{"text":"Well, I have to give them credit for the quantity of food they give you at the given prices. Good Lord. Of the three times I've been there I legitimately am concerned that my takeaway container is going to break from the sheer weight of the food.  Having said that, the quality leaves something to be desired. I most recently got Donburi, which is supposed to be simply fried meats on top of rice and egg with maybe some vegetables mixed in. The rice and egg was fine, but the breading on the meat was so soggy it eventually made me gag trying to eat it. In fact, everything kind of seemed like it had been made first thing in the morning and thrown under a heat lamp until I made the mistake of buying it in the afternoon.  There's a few dishes that are a bit safer, I think. Generally the more simple, classic Chinese food will do you well. Otherwise you may as well go to Chang Jiang."}
{"text":"Tai's is worth a try!    Plenty of parking with a nice space next to the Half-Price books on Whitney Way. Order at the counter, grab a table and the nice folks will bring your order to you.  In retrospect, this does seem to be our go-to place near home.  We know it will always be good and fast.     The last year or so we have primarily been getting a variation of their family meal. For a set price, you can choose from a two - six person meal.  They have three categories of entrées to choose and mix and match from.   As an example, we had the three person family meal tonight and the variation we chose included four items - - one item from column A, two from column B and one from C. We chose crispy chicken, spicy beef, Singapore rice noodles, and Shanghai bok choy, all for about $35!  Everything was awesome and we had plenty for leftovers. I highly recommend that combination.   The people here have always been super nice and great; the space, clean, comfortable and casual.  The food and service have been consistently good.  We have been visiting since they opened. (Feels like at least 10+ years).   Prices are reasonable for Madison and there's a variety of things to suit most anyone through a variety of Asian dishes.  For example,  Mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, Korean barbecue short ribs, pad thai, Japanese bento boxes, sushi, and Vietnamese pho noodle soup. They also have items for the more adventurous such as whole steamed fish, fried frogs legs,  and other things off of their traditional Chinese menu. Boba tea, too!  We love Tai's and the nice folks there.  Really a hidden gem on the near West side.   Given that they have been so consistently solid for us over the many years, I must give them an Yelp extra star. So four Yelp stars!  Give them a go!  See you there!  Yelp on!"}
{"text":"Close to my work, so I tend to go there rather often. Nice folks and a wide variety of pan-Asian cuisine. Thoughts on certain dishes:  Beef noodle soup (haven't had it in a while): Pretty good; I've had better in Taiwan but it'll satisfy the craving.  Lunch bento box: a very substantial amount of food for the price. Some of the dishes are deep-fried with breading and thus really make you feel sluggish afterwards; I suggest avoiding them.  Fried noodles: Huge portion, and good to eat. Recommended.  Tofu dishes: Again, large portions, stay away from the deep-fried varieties.  As far as Chinese places go in Madison, it's on the top half. Stop by if you're in the area looking for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Does the trick, they even have tapioca drinks. I'm happy to have a place on the west side where I can grab a quick tapioca tea. Order your food up front and pay, then they either bring it to you or call your order for you to pick up. We tried the Udon soup and the spicy chicken which was great. The red bean tapioco smoothie was really good too. Spring rolls are chinese (fried) style, not the Vietnamese style we were hoping for, but still tasty with some sweet & sour sauce.  Had a tough time finding it by the address since google maps is not updated enough to know it's in the Copps shopping center yet.  You can see the menu here: http://www.taismadison.com/menu.html"}
{"text":"We love this family run business. The food is authentic and makes me miss my mom's cooking at home. I wish they deliver but they're so good the drive is worth it. My favorites include the Crispy Chicken, Pea Tips, and the Drunk Ginger Spare Ribs. We also like that we're supporting a local family and a local business. In the afternoons you'll see their kids studying or playing at the tables closest to the bathrooms. We see the same family members working here every time we come so you're supporting a hard working family when you eat here."}
{"text":"Hey, this place is great! It's cheap, it's yummy, I don't ask for more. These are what I usually order the many times I've gone there:  Chicken Wrap Lettuce Korean Short Ribs Black Pepper Chicken Honey Walnut Shrimp  Slurpppp, delicious!"}
{"text":"God dammit.  I'm a man who hates throwing away good food. I was raised to finish my plate every meal, yet I STILL found the urge to toss my entire meal away.   My lady and I got the crab rangoon, chicken with cashew nut, and honey walnut shrimp. The crab rangoon was fine, but the entrees made us question the supposed \"authenticity\" mentioned by other reviewers. We're talking flavors and texture here. The chicken with cashew nut had a sauce that was prominently salty, a bit savory, until it all just disappeared in a way that screamed MSG. The dry shrimp looked deep-fried, but upon closer inspection, we noticed the fried batter was bendable. You gotta wonder if this stuff was pre-packaged in a freezer just minutes prior and microwaved for service.  We left full on cream cheese and Spotted Cow. Hasta nunca."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's quick, reliable and super tasty. I wish they'd deliver but their takeout and in restaurant eats is pretty great.  Favorites:  pea tips, double cooked pork.  Honestly, I haven't regretted anything I've ordered here."}
{"text":"I was invited here by my cousins, who have eaten here many times. After reading some of the reviews that were very uncomplimentary I wondered if I would be sticking to a salad and forgoing lunch, but the ten of us ate 'family style' from the varied menu. From the bok choy salad to the eggplant and tofu to the 'drunken' fish to several other dishes it was wonderful. Flavorful and nice portions. My conclusion is that perhaps some diners didn't know how to enjoy this cuisine."}
{"text":"First time trying. The meals were 'ok' nothing fantastic. The vegetable fried rice was really dry and crunchy, low on vegetables except the uncooked broccoli. The sweet and sour chicken tasted a little like fish and was pretty greasy. My mother in law states the chicken vegetable platter was 'ok' the vegetables we're almost raw, the chicken was 'good' the sauce was not great. My husband got the Pad Thai and he stated it was bland."}
{"text":"Love their dragon sushi roll, it is one of the best in town. The service is more like self serve. but staffs are very nice. THe food portion is huge, tasty too. I don't like their bubble tea at all, powder based, don't order it! Overall it is a good place to go!"}
{"text":"Updating my review to five stars. I have been here numerous times and it has lived up to how much I liked it the first couple of times. This has got to be some of the freshest Asian food I've ever had. They make everything to order, and it is fresh, light, and not greasy. Highly recommended for casual dining."}
{"text":"This place is so Americanized that even the ma po tofu is mediocre. That's usually a safe order at Americanized Chinese restaurants that specialize in cloyingly sweet dishes in heavy sauces, even when it's not on the menu. But, here, the mapo tofu comes in a thick sauce that's merely somewhat spicy.  Even more strangely, the sauce was sweetened by Hoisin sauce, instead of being pure szeuchuan chili oil (or, for that matter, having any szechuan chili oil at all). The tofu was larger, harder, and firmer than you normally get in ma po tofu and, instead of being topped with ground pork, they use a frozen vegetable mix of peas and carrots.  It's always a bad sign when a Chinese place serves sushi, or branches out into Korean or Japanese. This place does all of the above. I should have known better."}
{"text":"Amazing food,it is literally the best chinese food I have ever tasted I highly recommend this place to everyone. It's totally worth the money"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the portion and value for what you're paying...a lunch bowl that costs ~$6 will fill anyone up  That said, this place is a pretty typical Chinese place that offers typical Chinese dishes with quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Madison. Their selection is quite extensive: Thai, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. They also have gluten free and vegetarian options. For gluten free options, make sure you let them know that you have a gluten allergy and they can make almost any of their dishes gluten free. It's difficult to find Chinese and or Asian foods with gluten free options, so this is a good place for that option. I also love that their prices are affordable. I always get their beef pho because I love pho. I grew up eating pho Vietnamese style, even though their pho is more Cantonese style, it does not disappoint. Anything you order from their menu is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We noticed this hole in the wall around lunch time on a Saturday, so stopped in to grab a menu. The place was packed (much of the clientele was Asian, so that is always a good sign!). Passed one table with two ladies who were sharing a platter of fish, a whole fish - just the skeleton remained (another good sign).  We went back the next evening (Sunday night), and the place was empty! Slightly worried, we placed a massive order. By the time we were eating, about 5 other tables were filled. Plus take out orders being called in. The staff was hopping.  1. hot Jasmine tea - pre-brewed, had obviously been sitting in the large thermos for a LONG time. Very strong, and very bitter. Was going to complain, but the staff was really busy - I decided it wasn't worth it. 2. Spicy tuna roll - very spicy! Tasty, also has cucumber in it, but the consistency of the tuna was like pureed mush. Not a fan. 3. Buddha roll - peanut and avocado with a tasty sauce. Has potential, but it was just whole peanuts with the avocado - basically felt like we were just eating straight peanuts. Since we were ordering a ton of other dishes, we held off on some of the more exotic rolls, but we'll be back to try them soon! 4. Wonton soup - broth was rather bland (that is all my mom let me sample so I can't speak to flavor of the actual wontons). 5. Tsing Tao beer - skunky. Boo. You may now be wondering why I have given 4 stars to this place. Well, here we go.  Many of the dishes that we ordered are not on the regular menu - they had a separate \"Family Menu\" printed out and available to all: 6. Clams in black bean sauce - oh. my. goodness. I haven't seen this on any other menu in town. My favorite dish! It was an absolutely HUGE order. And soooo good. Some red and green chilis were also mixed in, so it had a bit of spice. 7. Singapore chicken - hubby got this one - nice spice, he was happy. 8. Pork ribs in black bean sauce - pai quat for those of you in to Dim Sum. Another huge order. Another big hit with the table. 9. Roast duck - wow. Really good. Nice and juicy, not greasy at all. Served with a nice sauce on the side. 10. Bok choy - stir fried with a light garlic and [I think] oyster sauce. Yet another huge order. We ate a ton of it. 11. Seafood noodle soup - nice broth, lots of seafood - shrimp, clams, scallops, shrimp balls. An absolute ton of noodles. My dad ordered this - he ate about 5% of it due to the rest of our feast, and took the remainder home.  There are so many other items I would love to try on their menu...though I'm afraid I'll be drawn to those clams every single time! We will definitely go back, again and again."}
{"text":"When first looking at the website and menu for this restaurant I was not interested in trying it at all. But out friends asked us to dinner with them at this restaurant so felt obliged to go. After looking at the yelp reviews I felt a little better about trying it, though I still had my reservations.  When we walked in the place it seemed fine, not too large in size and there were plenty of customers. Every person dinning there was of Asian decent so we thought that the restaurant might be more authentic. You seat yourselves and order at a counter as you would at a fast good restaurant but then the food is brought out to you (which we do not know how they remember what goes where because they do not give you numbers). The menus do not have any description of the food/entrees. It dies arrive fairly quickly unless you order their Dinner Special Box, which seemed to arrive 5 minutes after everyone else's meals.  I did like their crab Rangoon because it wasn't fried to long that the shell was too hard, but my boyfriend disliked how greasy it was. I was also not impressed with their egg rolls and he said they were okay. I ordered their Healthy Option of Chicken and broccoli (steamed chicken & veggies with white rice and sauce on the side). It was okay but the broccoli was not cooked enough and the sauce was very bland in taste as was my friends Sesame Chicken. My boyfriend had the Sichuan Beef that had broccoli, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and zucchini. I tried a bite of the beef and broccoli and my mouth was on fire! The broccoli holds in/absorbs lot of the spice, but my boyfriend mainly disliked how raw and uncooked the broccoli was.  Price was fine and the restaurant seemed cleanly enough but I've had better Chinese. I would not return or recommend others."}
{"text":"Decent little gem in the area! We have always driven past but never stopped by before until going with a few friends. First of all, this is not a place to order that satisfying Chinese-American takeout food that everyone craves once in awhile I don't think (such as orange chicken, lo mein, etc.). Secondly, everything is self-serve (grab your own bowls and plates in the corner and clean up after yourself).  We ordered several dishes from one of the combos and had pea tips, popcorn chicken, sauteed clams in black bean sauce, Asian style BBQ ribs, and fish in spicy oil. The pea tips were excellent as was the popcorn chicken. Sauteed clams in black bean sauce is always salty so it was as good as any place. The ribs were delicious but very fatty in my opinion, which made it tough to eat. The fish in spicy oil was the most disappointing part of our meal. It was bland and the flavoring was very one-dimensional. Four of us finished these five dishes without any leftovers, but the prices were very fair.   I'll definitely come back if I want a family style meal and definitely will try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"We're regulars here.  The food is always good.  Over the few years they've been around business has steadily grown,  but I don't think the staff ever has - they seem to have the same number of people in the kitchen on a killer busy night as a dead one.  Thus, when you dine in the wait can be long.  Tips: Skip the bubble tea and dinner plates.  Steamed pork buns are tasty."}
{"text":"I adore this place. zen zen taste and this place are my go to spots when I want some authentic chinese food in Madison. I think this is one of the more traditional chinese restaurants in the area. They have a chinese-american like menu as well as a more chinese-oriented menu. They have combo dinners for 2-8 people that are good to try. There are plenty of choices and most of them are pretty delicious. Stand outs include their fish, korean bbq ribs, and their pea tips (I always get this). We come here almost at least once a month.  If you're looking for the more traditional chinese experience, come here!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to think that it is, in fact, too much to ask to get a decent Chinese chicken dish on the west side of Madison (after a couple years I've only found one reliable place). Tai's is yet another place I can cross off the list for having seriously sub-par meat.   I ordered the sesame chicken. The portion size was hefty, the container felt like it weighed a couple of pounds. Unfortunately, the contents were so awful I can't even give them points for serving me enough for several meals.   My first bite was just a little guy (many of the pieces of chicken were enough for several bites), and I was immediately put off by the texture - well, really the lack thereof. There was no discernible difference between the meat and breading, which I find problematic. The taste was also lacking - it didn't taste like chicken, and there wasn't much to the gooey, blaze-orange sauce.   The next piece of chicken I went for had a disconcerting dark spot under the breading and glaze. Since there were some greens mixed in, I thought maybe a leaf had gotten stuck under the batter - but no. After cutting into it, I discovered it was dark grey meat. I skipped to the next piece, and noticed it too had a dark spot. Cut into that - same story. The next piece? Almost all fat and connective tissue. Now, before you go, \"this girl is dumb, it was probably just dark meat!\" - no. No no no. When half of the chicken chunk is white and half is not, there's something weird happening. Also, why does it have no texture? At all? I shouldn't be able to gum chicken without choking.   Yuck."}
{"text":"When I came here for the first time I was totally amazed: we ordered a set for 5 people and every dish was so yummy that it reminded me of the local flavor of my hometown Taiwan! The set contained 6 courses and unlimited rice so we had a great variety of food here and were really impressed.  The second visit, however, has somewhat changed my impression. Everything was just the same: cordial & fast service, clean environment, but when I started eating I suddenly realized they certainly put a lot of MSG in almost all dishes..  I can feel there's an unnatural, excessive enrichment in the flavor which made me quite uncomfy..:(  It would be kinda unfair to underrate this place simply because of the MSG issue, given that their price/quality is absolutely well balanced in terms of a casual bistro. My advice: if you're checking out this place don't forget to ask them not to use MSG. I'll probably give it another chance if things get better without MSG."}
{"text":"The big draw for me is that they have boba! Nothing special about it, but it does the job. As for the food, I got the Beijing beef. It's listed as a spicy item but personally I found it mostly sweet and only a bit spicy (though that may speak more to my preferences, and I've never had Beijing beef before either so it may not usually be very spicy). The texture of the beef was unusual. I found it to be very soft and mushy, not like a cut of gourmet meat but more like textured beef substitute. I ordered it as a bento box, which comes with 3 pieces of sushi roll. FYI you don't get to choose what kind you get, it's just a standard imitation crab and avocado. The rice used seemed pretty stale though. The fried rice also had bean sprouts, which is a first for me. They also seem to have used non-stale/old rice for the fried rice which means it was more moist than usual, another oddity to me. Like any good Chinese restaurant though, the portions are great; I ended up having to take a doggie bag.   In short, I was disappointed by the Beijing beef bento box; other items may be fine. The boba is a big plus if you like it. If you're looking for Chinese though, I'm a much bigger fan of Chang Jiang near Woodman's, which is exclusively Chinese and has a much wider menu selection, similar prices, and has consistently had good food."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've eaten here.  So I'm hoping this will soon be updated to reflect a better experience; but I really felt as though I had to send out this one to the masses.  A coworker has been raving about the bento boxes, sushi and crab rangoon here for a while, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I looked online trying to decide, and spotted a gorgeous picture of Pad Thai on their website- it had tons of scallions, was a nice, natural pad thai color, and generally looked appetizing.  I recognize that the pictures rarely match what is served, but this was really a giant disparity.  I ordered crab rangoon and pad thai to go.  When I got back to the office, I dug into the rangoon.  It was easily the most amazing crab rangoon I have ever had!  I don't much care for fried foods in general, and even less for rangoon.  But seriously, I could have ordered three apps and happily made a nice big lunch out of those. (They're quite tiny).  Then, I opened the pad thai, served with a side of fried rice.  The color was shocking.  Now, I've seen a pretty wide variety of colored dishes claiming to be pad thai- and I definitely lean towards the orangey ones.  But this is Ronald McDonald Red.  Marinara Red.  Like the Yelp insignia red.  I had ordered it with chicken, and tried to pick through to find some- couldn't tell the difference between egg and chicken; also, there were clearly tentacles in my dish, fried up with whatever passes for protein.  The noodles were inedible.  I have no idea what they were supposed to be flavored with, but it was so gross, that as hungry as I was and for the money spent, I couldn't even TRY to FORCE myself to eat them.  Revolting.  The fried rice wasn't flavored at all.  Not soy, not salt, nothing.  I had to eat something besides rangoon, and since this was the least offensive of the two dishes, I dumped the rangoon sauce on the rice and ate only what it touched.  $10 spent, crab rangoon out of this world, pad thai absolutely disgusting, and throw-away fried rice.  I hope the next experience is better, since I'm going back for the rangoon."}
{"text":"Great Asian cuisine at Tai's.  Love to carry out.  Lunch AND dinner portions are, um, hearty, if you will.  I love their stir-fry, and the counter staff seem happy to see me ... well, happy to see everyone.  Even the cooks acknowledge your presence.  I'm also a big fan of their carry out containers.  The place has great parking, too."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place.  Although cheap, the cheapness also stings in the quality of service.  The girls are flighty, and very rude.  We walked in the place at 7 pm the first time we came here.  There were nearly 9 tables free, but not a single one of them had been bussed.   We ordered our food, but could not sit anywhere.  When I politely asked the front girl if she could maybe quickly clean a table, I got a rude response, and a \"can you wait a minute?\" in a curt tone of voice.   All in all, we waited a total of 30 minutes without anyone cleaning a table off.  I had to take the dishes off of one table and place them on another.   The table we sat at was covered in greasy brown sauce, but so was all the other options.  I bit my tongue as I watched as the same gal I told to help us clean off the table, drop off our food, without offering a quick wipedown of our table.  It was really atrocious.  I was totally disgusted with this, but the food was ok, and cheap so we decided  we'd still try again, this time opting to carry out instead.    The second time, my fiance ordered sushi and PLEASE do not order this, unless you want second rate large overstuffed rolls that have no flavor or technique in their presentation.  (the gals are the ones responsible for this as well).  I feel bad for this establishment, because I think the poor service and the total MSG that others have written about on here will be the death of their dreams.    Hopefully they will read this and try to save their dream.  But I doubt it.  The only saving grace may in fact be the dumplings here.  Other than that, save your money.  It's just not worth it, and the people running the place won't be too inclined to make you happy either."}
{"text":"Came in 45 minutes before my sister had to start her shift so we wanted a quick bite. We were greeted and my sister ordered the pad Thai and I ordered the roasted duck. After about a 5 minute wait, our food was served! So quick! My sister's pad Thai was definitely Chinese inspired Thai food so it wasn't what she expected (obviously, don't order a different cuisine from another cuisine) but it wasn't bad. My duck was delicious! Crispy and juicy with a side of rice for only $12! I will definitely be coming back for my duck!"}
{"text":"Meh. Good in terms of \"Chinese\" food but nothing special. I don't recommend the Chicken and Broccoli. As usual, it's drenched in sauce. Fried rice is pretty good."}
{"text":"You come to this place for its authentic Chinese food. This review is for the reference of Chinese students who won't order orange chicken or broccoli beef. You need to order from the Chinese menu. Every dish that I have tried so far has been delicious. Portion is huge. Place is clean. Service is super fast. The only drawback is that it's a little far from campus area. But this place is way better than ichiban and Fugu. So if you really miss Chinese food, travel a little bit and come here!"}
{"text":"When in doubt, Tai's will always be there.   This is my go to place when going with a group of friends and simply crave for dinner that makes everyone leave with a happy belly. This would be a good switch if people want to try something aside from Ichiban or Fugu - both has great food as well, but the flavor can be too intense and similar at times.  At Tai's, I always ordered from their Family Dinner menu (where we choose x number of dishes from different columns labeled A, B, and C). This is the list that would give you their most authentic dishes. Aside from the shrimp and flounder, most of the selections here have great flavor, great portion, and literally freaking fast service.  After going here frequent enough, my recommendations are:  - Salted & pepper calamari - Fish in chili sauce - Braised beef - Black pepper beef - Crispy chicken - Double cooked pork - Stir fried pea tips  As I always said, never judge a restaurant by its facade. Come, taste, and experience it yourself"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a West Madison strip mall, Tai's Asian Bistro makes the most of location.  While little natural filters in from the small windows on the front of the store, the use of red paper lanterns and colorful lamps imparts a soothing vibe into the space.   The restaurant appears better maintained that many of the Asian food joints in town, with its freshly painted walls and matching dark wood of the chairs and tables.  Also impressive is the gleaming stainless steel of the open kitchen, which buzzed with activity during the heart of the lunch hour rush.  I ordered at the counter, found an open table in the relatively large dining area and after a ten minute wait, a server delivered my food.  The lunch menu is surprisingly affordable, with many tantalizing options priced as low as $5.85.  I opted for the Korean BBQ short ribs and was thrilled with my choice.  The thin slices of bone-in meat were lightly marinated and had a hint of smoke.  While it took a little effort to get the meat off the bones, I was rewarded with a mouthful of satisfying flavor.  The fried rice that accompanied my BBQ, while not spectacular, was better average.  Pro tip: Tai's does a booming carryout business during the lunch hour, so consider calling in your order in advance of your visit if you are looking to do a quick lunch.  I'll definitely return to explore more of the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The menu here is enormous! It's almost overwhelmingly so...there are very American dishes like general tso's along with various intestine options; basically, there is something for everyone.  I went here to try one of the lunch specials for take out. The box came with sushi, salad, fried rice, and a main (Korean BBQ is what I selected.) Service was quick and friendly - no troubles there. My expectations were not exactly met with the meal itself though. The salad was iceberg lettuce with some sort of Italian dressing which I thought was very odd. The sushi was 3 rolls of a take on a California roll - nothing too impressive. The fried rice was a little oily for my taste as well...the Korean BBQ did have great flavor, albeit a little hard to eat with so many inedible parts - but very tasty all the same.   I probably will go back to try some more of their immense options, however, I will probably stay clear of the \"bento box\" and go for the plate."}
{"text":"Really good Asian food! Super fast service and take out! Wide variety on the menu and reasonably priced! Go to take out place for sure!"}
{"text":"Very nice variety for the money. Daughter asked for and got seafood soup with all fishballs. Lots of vegetarian options. Tempura roll was quite good.  Don't bother with the bento boxes. Avoid the sesame chicken--fatty and not tasty at all."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Go to Copp's next door and get a frozen burrito. You will be better off.  Ordered the curry tofu. It was disgusting. The sauce must have had at least 1/2c of cornstarch in it, but not even a whisper of curry (despite being identified as spicy on the menu). No veggies other than onions, which is irrelevant because even better veggies would have been rendered inedible by the cornstarch sauce.   They have a newspaper review hanging by the soda machine. I can't imagine why they hung it up as the review is not good, but of course by the time I read it I'd already ordered. A shame that they didn't read the review and make an effort to improve upon the failings noted. But that review was 4 years old. If they haven't fixed things yet, I can't imagine they ever will.  The pre-fab fortune cookies were fine."}
{"text":"love coming here! they have a wide variety of dishes on their menu. we usually get the fish dishes like the drunk ginger flounder (they also have a sea bass option) and the lightly sauteed Shanghai bok choy. they also have a nice roast duck that tastes fresh and soft, although it can be quite fatty. look for the discounted meal options if you order multiple dishes from their menu. if you are craving for hearty meals, visit this spot on the west side. your tummy will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving Tai's Asian Bistro either a 3 star or perhaps 4, but I think it can solidly be a 3.5. Overall, there are a lot of authentic Taiwanese food here at a semi-affordable price. There's actually so many selections on the menu, that it can be overwhelming trying to pick what to eat.   We're dined in a few times, but more often than not, we usually just order take out, pay at the counter and leave. The restaurant as a whole has a lot of seating available, however it's not a typical dine-in, with a waitress taking orders at the table experience. All orders are taken at the counter and paid up front, and then if you eat in, then it'll be served directly to your table. Otherwise, you can take a seat and then grab pick up to go.   The food is quite typical of an Asian stall food, and the quality of the food is decent for the type of establishment that it is. The duck noodle soup that I got today had a rich beefy broth, with good proportion of duck and noodles. The noodles was a bit sticky in the sense that it was stuck to each other, but nonetheless delicious in combination with the broth, duck meat, baby bok choy veggies and bean sprouts.   I specifically asked for no green onions as I always do, and was assured that the dishes no longer comes with green onions (even though in the past it did and I had to send it back to the kitchen only to have them try to remove the green onions from the fish as opposed to making a fresh dish). So for that, I am glad that I did not have to send the dish back since it was made right the first time around.  The one thing that I'd recommend is to pass on ordering any of the bubble teas, it is not fresh ingredients and the tapioca is hard to chew. Even the way that the cashier lady makes it makes you weary of drinking it (she used water and ice from the soda machine on the side outside the counter, hot from from the container inside, and then milk from underneath the container).   Look at the menu ahead of time, and place a phone order in advance, so you can grab a meal to go. It's a good place for when you're carving more authentic Asian cuisine at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 12 times over the past few months. Fairly inexpensive Asian food with the only bubble tea available on the west side of Madison make it appealing. A few dishes have been great, like the honey walnut chicken and fried dumplings, and a few not so good, like the pad thai. The staff seem friendly, and given the price I just overlooked the odd chaos. By chaos, I mean that your food will come in no particular order, and each dish might come out separately. The dumplings might come after the main dishes - I just rolled with it. The kitchen has not figured out how to make one table's dishes timed correctly, and that hasn't changed over the past few months.   I have always seen a large Asian clientele, and that's great for them. However, it seemed to me that sometimes the Asian patrons were getting hooked up with their food before us whites, but I never saw an actual pattern, and like I said the kitchen is not well timed so I never worried about it.  Until tonight. We ordered dumplings, two main dishes, and two bowls of white rice. The dumplings came out first, and I had to call the woman back because we had no utensils, napkins, plates, etc. She brought back utensils, but no plates. My guy went up to get them. As we were eating our dumplings, a party of 6 Asian Americans came in and ordered. As they sat next to us, the woman working the register brought out our main dishes - but no rice. When I asked where it was, she said they were out. I have never, ever, been to an Asian restaurant that ran out of rice, but this one is pretty chaotic. She said they were making more.  We start picking at our main dishes (because they really needed white rice to eat!) when I saw the woman bring a large bowl of white rice to a table behind us, who had been seated before we got there. Good, I thought, it's cooked. So then the woman brings over another bowl of white rice - and sets it on the table next to us. It's for the table of Asians who arrived at least ten minutes after us, have no other food on their table, and with whom the lady jokes for a minute. She then heads away, ignoring us.   My husband went up to the counter to ask where our rice was. The woman says there isn't any ready, and he asks why the other party got some, when we were clearly next in line, had our main dishes, and they had nothing yet. She acted as if she could not understand the issue. Finally, a few minutes later she wanders over with rice and asks if we want it. We declined.   As a White chick, I haven't been discriminated against often, but this really, really felt like discrimination. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise!  I expected your typical run of the mill Chinese restaurant taste but the food has a nice kick to its flavor. Although it's not entirely different from your other local Chinese restaurants, I would probably say it's one of the better establishment.  Many Chinese places have a musty old sticky food smell but I actually didn't sense that when I stepped in.  The establishment felt clean and as a customer, I could see the food being cooked right there.  It may not make much difference to some but I just feel that much better when I see it being cooked in front of my eyes.  The turnaround time was very quick to get my food and I was acknowledged right away with a smile!  Pretty impressive for a Chinese restaurant amiright?  The food was definitely fresh along with the vegetables.  The pad Thai was ok tasting, not what you would expect a traditional pad Thai dish to taste like but it had an original flavor that's inviting.  The hot and sour soup tasted wonderfully as if the chef made it perfect that day.  The sushi was fresh and tasted better than I expected.  It had a nice, but not overpowering vinegar kick to it.    This was my first time here but if every experience was like today's then I would recommend this to everyone! Thanks for reading!"}
