{"text":"Everything about our recent dinner at Spice was excellent ... my wife raved about her stuffed avocado entree, and I very much enjoyed my Lake Erie walleye. The appetizer selections that we shared with our friends were also deliciously well executed.  The warm atmosphere, the wine and cocktail selection and attentive service rounded out a terrific dining experience at Spice."}
{"text":"The most delicious brunch I've had in Cleveland. So so SO good. I can't say how wonderful of a meal this was.  The Peach Bellini was great. Fresh and not too sweet. My husband's Spicy Mary was a little too chunky for me but the flavor was good. I also ordered the juice of the day, which is from the juice place nearby.  We started with the Apple Cinnamon Beignets. They're not exactly the same texture as a New Orleans beignet but still very tasty with the goat cheese dip.  The Toastado plate was amazing. Every bite was full of flavor and made me want to do a happy dance with every bite.  The Dixie Benedict was also amazing. The eggs were PERFECTLY runny, (which is a peeve of mine. I have come across WAY too many places where the chef overcooked a poached egg). The smashed potato side was crispy and also seasoned to perfection.  I can't wait to go back for another brunch and eventually a dinner."}
{"text":"The brat burger here was unlike anything I've ever tasted.  I can't wait to go back for another one.  The service was pretty great, too."}
{"text":"Great food!  The place was pretty dead for a Thursday night.  The deco was intimate, cozy and somewhat modern. The menu was awesome!  Plenty of seasonal choices with locally sourced food.  I ordered the duck burger.  I don't exactly have a standard bearer for duck burgers, but this was well prepared.  The service was great too! Not worthy of 5 stars but Definitely a strong 4."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, nice beer and wine list. Server could have done a better job-one of the 4 oysters served was rank. Server was informed and no action to rectify was taken. After that got the drink wrong. Apple crisp had a mealy texture and the ice cream served on top poor quality.    Quality of food and service did not match the menu prices."}
{"text":"Delicious! Started with the \"baby it's cold outside\" to drink and it was very good. For an appetizer, we got the focaccia. It came with an olive tapenade and a chickpea purée. I definitely could have eaten the whole thing by myself. For my entrée, I ordered the tea hill chicken breast. INCREDIBLE. The presentation, the taste, it could not have been better. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Take the 3-star rating with a grain of salt and as a reflection of my abbreviated dining experience.  Spice Kitchen was the Fine Dining Group's third installment for 2013. I arrived late, missing out on cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. Plus we skipped out on dessert (Sweet Moses was calling our names).   I made it in time for the mushroom beignets and what must have been a spectacular cheese board. Both were wonderful as was the tomato bisque. I will be going back to try the other items on the menu.   The highlight for me was the striped bass which was perfectly seared - crisp on the outside, tender and seasoned on the inside. It was a beautiful piece of fish that was beautifully cooked. The parsnip mash perked up the dish, a gentle reminder that fall was here. Loved everything about this dish!  Properly prepared fish is my benchmark for a great restaurant.  We passed around a risotto dish. It was tasty but not memorable. My fellow diners and I usually share our dishes but the bass was the overwhelming favorite that evening.  Service was efficient, friendly and attentive. Warm ambiance in the main dining hall. We were seated at a large rustic table, reminiscent of vineyards in Tuscany or Napa. Centerpieces were garden flowers and other botanicals along with mason jars of preserved vegetables.   I enjoyed my dining experience. Though I do need to revisit Spice Kitchen again to size up the wine selection and courses -- including the profiteroles."}
{"text":"If it were an option, I would probably give Spice a 3.5.  Went here after work for happy hour and sat at the bar.  I was unimpressed by the decor, which seems to me a random assortment of trinkets and knick-knacks with no real theme.  I was impressed by how large and wide open it feels compared to some other restaurants in the neighborhood.  I believe I was ordering my drinks and food from the manager, and he seemed pretty knowledgeable and eager to engage in conversation.  I will say that the whole place has a very congenial atmosphere: both the customers and staff were very talkative and friendly.  The main problem here is that I was underwhelmed by the food.  It is a little pricey at $20-30 plates, which wouldn't normally be a problem if they were worth it.  Between myself and my date we had 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  My entree at least was both a very small portion and a little more bland than I would expect from a restaurant named \"Spice.\"  I was hungry again about two hours after I left.  Certainly not what you want after a $100.00 bill."}
{"text":"I went here with family and it was delicious! All of our meals were cooked perfectly. We started off with the polenta fries and mushroom beignets and they were both amazing! We all wanted more. A few of us had the stuffed acorn squash and it was fabulous! The flavors were perfect. My fiance had the rabbit ravioli and he loved his dish. It was seasoned to perfection. The cocktails we ordered were all also very delicious. I love how they have a garden next door with fresh ingredients. We would like to visit this restaurant again for brunch in the near future!"}
{"text":"Sat by the bar both times and had incredible service and cocktails. Such a comfortable atmosphere that we stayed a couple hours and ordered 8 or 9 shared plates on the first visit. Next time had equally great service and the menu had changed so we sat through about the same length meal with multiple shared plates and it was great. The dumplings, fried green tomatoes and fish cake definitely were standouts. Phenomenal bartenders."}
{"text":"Spice is always a great choice! The menu is seasonal with much of the food coming from the restaurant's own farm. Service is very good and knowledgeable. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came by myself because I wanted to see the band playing on the patio and Beardyman was at football. Staff gave me some looks that were a bit questioning but I like eating by myself.   I've eaten at Spice Box many times and thoroughly enjoyed their Dyngus Day fare. This time eating at the actual Spice restaurant has been extremely pleasing.  I ordered the crudite board and a side of fries. All of the veggies were  from local farms (they listed which ones for me). They were served with a yummy green aioli and a pesto made from veggie tops and deliciousness.  Everything was excellent. The fries came with a jalapeno ketchup. So good.  Will be back with Beardyman and we will continue to enjoy Spice's other appearances in the community."}
{"text":"Pricey but it is by far the best dining experience I've ever had. Dave, our waiter knew a lot about the meals and drinks offered here. The food was fabulous! The burger was amazing and the ravioli too! Worth the price!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal capped off our day-trip to Cleveland. Although we loved our little bowl of sweet olives, it seemed that the fried polenta sticks were the snack to order, judging by their presence at almost every other table. The wine-by-the glass selection is good. We each enjoyed a perfectly dressed salad, the one with a 6-minute egg and the one with beets. My husband's duck burger was a good choice, served medium, but my game hen was too salty. Bread is an extra, and we didn't need it. Do not miss dessert! The rosemary smoked cream puffs were perfectly devine. All-in-all, a well-spent two hours."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with another couple.  1st time there and it won't be the last!  Food was excellent.  Service was okay - we had a waiter who hovered too much including taking our napkins away while we were sitting and engaged in a conversation.  Plus he tended to remove plates prior to us being finished.  On the other hand... The hostess could not have been more gracious! Even the bartenders shouted buy when we left! Had a Cheers moment!  The soup de jour was a cauliflower bisque and it was outstanding. We all had different entrees and we all loved our meals. Atmosphere had a good energy.  Again we will be back with more friends!"}
{"text":"Quality was very good, portions were quite small, especially the $11 salad. Not enough veggie options for me, very animal protein based entrees. Would like to see more plant-based options."}
{"text":"So had some friends in from NYC and Cuyahoga Falls and we decided to take them to Spice Kitchen.  It was a fantastic evening from the wine selection, polenta chick pea fries, mushroom beignets, delicious spicy corn bisque, walleye, to the ribs.  We always have a great meal here and the staff is out of this world friendly.  This space has held a few different restaurants over the last couple years and we couldn't be happier that Spice landed in our neighborhood.  Friend them on facebook as they post specials and we have switched dinner plans to go try them.  We weren't disappointed.  If you are going to dine in Cleveland, you need to go here."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Easter Sunday and had a great experience. We were able to get a large table for 8 and despite how busy it was, our waitress was very attentive. The food was great. Everything was fresh and they had good vegetarian and meat options. Also came here for happy hour a couple times and loved it. The drinks were good and our bartender was really nice."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place.  Visited on a slow Sunday evening (they have happy hour even on Sundays from 4-7 I believe!) and experienced exceptional service. The bartender that served our table really knew his stuff and provided thoughtful answers to our questions about the menu.   We ordered the bread service which came with a delicious lardo spread, house made jam and some mozzarella/green olive concoction. Each of these toppings were amazing, but the jam was exceptional! I wish I could buy some to take home.  My friend ordered the seasonal flatbread, which was so simple, but incredibly delicious, and I ordered the wild boar belly and polenta. Both of these items came from the happy hour menu and were equally delicious and filling. Great happy hour pricing for the portion sizes.  I will be back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, gracious, me oh my! Pig and Whiskey Wednesday is the best accidental walk in find this summer! The staff is on point, being able to explain awesome fancy dishes to a layman like myself and not miss a beat. The kitchen staff takes pride in their creations and it shows. Now onto the swine...... Succulent, smokey, with the right touch of both sweet and heat. BEST DAMN TATER SALAD this side o' the Mason Dixon line. If libations are in your que then be it wine, beer, or whiskey, this joint will show you a trick or 6. Anyone who is up for a great time with an awesome staff, this is a definite stop on the so good it makes ya want to box it up and live on the street with it!"}
{"text":"The Polenta \"fries\" are good. The $21.00  Pappardelle Chicken was good except for a few pieces of dried chicken.  If you are charging your customer $21.00 for chicken and pasta; the dish should  be damn near perfect. (I buy  Giant Eagle rotisserie chicken for $6.00 and I have yet to find a piece that is dry).  The Margarita was good.  The service was friendly.  We will probably eat here again because we want to support small businesses in redeveloping urban areas.  However, let's hope that on the next visit,  all of the chicken on my plate is moist and tender."}
{"text":"1/2 star really. We were really excited to try this place out, given the vegetarian and vegan options. The waitress- No explanation of menu was given. Did not take take the time to review specials for drink and food, until we asked. Took an amazing amount of time to realize the sangria drink was out. She walked by us multiple times without asking for our order. Total of 25 minutes until we had A drink on the table and still missing one. The hostess super apologetic and sincere. Perhaps we will try this place in the future."}
{"text":"Beautiful service, beautiful patio, beautiful food. Hanger steak with naan is the way to go."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Cleveland! Sat outside on the patio, it was a nice and quiet atmosphere (which was in contrast with the atmosphere inside, which seemed a bit noisier and very busy). Our waitress was very attentive and walked us through the menu, making appropriate recommendations based on our interests--and we were very pleased with everything she recommended!  For starters, we chose an assortment of appetizers so that we could get a good, well-rounded taste of what Spice is about: mushroom beignets, cheese board, pork rinds, and soup of the day (a corn chowder with chili--it was so good!) I've got to say, I was impressed. There aren't that many restaurants in Cleveland that get me excited about food, Spice definitely defied that. I'm excited for their seasonal menus and to see what else they have in store."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. Service too. Need some artisans breads or crackers - something to take the edge off when waiting for your main event."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal from start to finish. The cocktails were well crafted and carefully considered. The wine list was immaculate and both bottles that were recommended to us were excellent. And then the meal, oh my... melt in your mouth delicious. The spice, seasoning, and savoriness of all dishes was amazing. Our waitress Alexandria made great suggestions and everything we ordered was so perfectly prepared. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Spice a few times since it opened earlier this year and it's been a great experience each time.  The food is fresh and flavorful and the service is top notch.  It's a bit noisy but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  If you care about the food you eat and the way it is prepared I highly recommend Spice Kitchen & Bar."}
{"text":"My wife and i had a wonderful time! The food was amazing and the menu as fresh as could be! Service was the best we had anywhere very pleasant and the waitress very knowledgeable about the menu. We would good back to here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I would NEVER recommend this restaurant.  We had a reservation for dinner Saturday night.  Toward the end of our evening, the manager came to our table and said she \"didn't want us to think she was kicking us out,\" but that they needed our table for another reservation, and she would be happy to \"facilitate\" a drink for us in the bar.  We were paying like everyone else.  We started out with appetizers and were finishing our dessert, and it was still less than 2 hours, which is not that long considering its an evening affair.  Absolutely rude and unacceptable."}
{"text":"So I visited the Spice Kitchen + Bar for the first time Friday July 5 and I love it and highly recommend it......I had the pleasure of meeting Dave H. who makes AWESOME DRINKS....wait did I say AWESOME DRINKS.....I was introduced to a new vodka OYO Stone Fruit.....simply marvelous.....the atmosphere is divine very classy and upscale...my next visit I will try the food......the bar is open until 2 a.m. but they are closed Sunday and Monday....So stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Having been here once, I like almost everything about Spice. I am hoping to return and reinforce my positive opinion soon. The chickpea and polenta fries are probably addictive (my friend and I like to pretend to be restrained and, er, \"healthy\", but within five minutes of finishing our order, we were seriously considering another one, even though we knew we had entrees coming and needed to same room for Sweet Moses), though I wasn't a fan of the dip they came with (no big deal- they really didn't need anything else). I told the bartender I \"wanted to try a red wine and learn something about what kind of wine I like\" and he was extremely accommodating and poured a delicious, reasonably priced wine, in addition to providing some wine education.  My friend had the potato cauliflower ravioli and I tried a bite. It was quite lovely, though in my opinion I had the winning dish (the brined pork loin). It came with a fabulous sauce and more importantly, candied garlic and bacon. The pork was cooked perfectly, and the whole meal just made me happy."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Food is of good quality and taste, drinks are well-drafted and the atmosphere is pleasant. Nice place for a date night or fancier dinner with family or friends."}
{"text":"100% Dishcrawl Approved!  Spice Kitchen and Bar jumped on board the very first Cleveland Dishcrawl and did not disappoint. They provided fish tacos, mushroom beignets and a ridiculously delicious curry soup over jasmine rice in the warm, intimate space.   Chef Ben took the time to speak to our group in depth - and even fielded questions. Spice does more than  \"just\" provide seasonal, local, and fresh food in a unique way - it is a friendly place with personality, from Jess who fielded the details of my event, Dave the bartender who calmed my nerves, and to all the waitstaff that scrambled to serve 40+ people in a very short time frame - THANK YOU!    I will be back!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious food that holds its own among the other great restaurants in ohio city/tremont.  not to mention delicious old-fashioned cocktails, friendly service, warm decor and mason jars!  we ordered the mushroom beignets (piping hot, melt in your mouth), polenta chick pea fries (OMG), squash risotto (love the apple on top) and chicken with spaetzle and each course was better than the last.  the place also has a lively bar on friday and saturday nights.  i will be back.  with bells on."}
{"text":"First time here, incredible food! We had the biscuits and gravy, Dixie benedict, duck burger, omelet du jour--all delicious. Plus impeccable service and farm-to-table sustainability. We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Visited Saturday night just before 10. Called ahead and the hostess informed us there wouldn't be a wait for 2. Found a spot on the street very close to the restaurant.   We were greeted immediately and given our choice of tables. We sat in the bar area. As opposed to other reviewers, I thought it was very warm inside. I was too warm actually, but it seemed to cool off a little later on.   Our server was Raquel (if I remember correctly). She was really friendly and on top of everything we needed. We ordered drinks and they came out pretty quickly.  The drinks were excellent.   We had the chickpea fries and flatbread as a \"main\" course, and soup and salad to start. My caesar salad was delicious. Very peppery, lots of cheese. The chickpea fries were not my favorite, just because the texture was not my thing. The flatbread was very good.   I guess I didn't bring my A game in the appetite department because I had no room for dessert. I will definitely save room next time."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I will be back for sure. Only thing wrong the waitress didn't know what was on the cheese plate we ordered, otherwise this would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Spice is a high quality dining experience. Delicious, expertly prepared food in a comfortable atmosphere with knowledgeable, friendly, attentive staff.  The quinoa hash for brunch is so good!"}
{"text":"Eh, they are okay. Food is so-so but pricey. Drinks are excellent. We have gone there three times and we are at about 50/50 on our experience - both food and service. For the $$$ - go to Luxe. In fairness though--- every event we have gone to that Spice has catered has been excellent."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best food I've eaten in a long time! Everything was extremely delicious and outstanding! The best chicken confit ever. Roasted cabbage-- amazing! Wonderful desserts and cocktails. Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful setting. Can't wait for next visit. Keep up the fabulous work, Bebenroths! Truly impressed with your restaurant, your farm and we are so glad you are close to home!"}
{"text":"Great service, great menu, great vibes. I got not by the spice bug and cannot stop going back!"}
{"text":"The food was quite good and was plated nicely as well.  The pork chop was a large portion and cooked perfectly.  Prices were what you'd expect from a farm to table style restaurant although I was a little surprised that the cup of soup was $8... they may have called it a bowl, but it was a cup.  Overall I had to drop the rating a bit for the flighty service of the waiter.  There were significant periods of time where he disappeared... he took our appetizer order but then was gone until we were done with it, and even then about 10 minutes went by before I was able to get enough other servers' attention to maybe rouse him to come back to us to take out entree orders.  When we first arrived it was nearly empty so there's no real excuse for that level of inattentiveness on his part.  As we progressed through the meal, other older and significantly louder diners showed up as well.  The way the tables are arranged and the style of the decor makes it difficult to have a normal volume conversation with the person across the table from you.  I'm not saying people should have to whisper to one another but it seems like most of the other customers around us all thought they had the need to orate their stories of intrigue in the Cleve."}
{"text":"Service was very slow, and our server basically ignored us, even though the restaurant was not busy.   Food was good when it eventually arrived."}
{"text":"Classy place and a unique menu. I never leave here unsatisfied for primarily vegetarian and vegan dishes. Very hearty and healthy! They also have plenty of meat options but one look at the menu and it caters more to the veggie kind...atmosphere is tasteful and minimalist."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious....unique flavors presented in a beautiful way.  Each dish is thoughtfully put together with the finest ingredients.  Our son is a foodie and travels the world. His description...superb!  He had the shrub cocktail and raved about it.  He had a special pork dish that he said was fantastic. I had the hanger steak and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great dinner with my wife and friends. We feasted on the appetizers, only to be full by the time our entrees arrived. Stuffed peppers with chorizo were great with just enough spice.  The cheese board was the best I have ever had, and the cornbread with jam was also good. Server was great and answered all our questions with patience and a smile.  Thanks Spice for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday birthday brunch. Started with the Morning Joe. Can't remember what was in it, but it was very tasty.   Had 2 appetizers, a chorizo and egg flat bread and a Scottish egg (see pictures). Presentation was crazy good, but the taste of each was just so so. I started to ask myself why they call this place Spice, as both were a bit bland.   And then the main courses came out.  Yum yum yum yum yum!  I had the hangover burger, an andouille patty with a fried egg and apple jelly on the bun. Delicious. Came with seasoned fried potatoes that were good on their own, but when dipped in the side sauce were very good.   The boy ordered a steak and blue cheese omelette. We split each and it was very good too. Didn't care for all the greens in it, but the steak was sliced thin and tasty. Also at our table was the popover pancake, chicken and waffle, and the vegetable hash. Not a plate went back to the kitchen with a stitch on it.   Service was very good and attentive."}
{"text":"I came here because of restuarant week. I wanted the mushroom goat cheese beignets, which were awesome. Then I got the lamb+beef meatballs, looked good, smelled good, tasted meh. Dessert was apple walnut banana pudding; it looked good, but tasted  underwhelming.   Service was attentive. I got the \"bartender's choice\", but  the bartender didn't bother to explain what was in it. For a hipster bar that's kinda disappointing. It tasted like a whiskey sour with orange zest. $6.   $39 price tag+ tax&tip. They charged $11 each for appetizers, entree, and dessert. Not worth it. 3hrs after dinner, I'm hungry again.  I could have just ordered the mushroom beignets for $7."}
{"text":"Came in last Friday dining for the first time.  I made reservations, but it wasn't too crowded when we arrived. Sat outside on the patio which is nice, but love the decor of the inside.  We had happy hour wine ($5) for a heavy pour with the chicken pesto flatbread and chickpea fries.  We shared their feature entree of braised beef with beans and swiss chared.  Honestly the food was amazing.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  Oh, and we split the Peach & Blackberry Cobbler with vanilla ice cream and it was perfect.  Waitress was fun and knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food, as usual, was very good. Our server Robert should have stayed home because it appeared he wanted to be somewhere else. I regret tipping 20%."}
{"text":"Excellent farm-to-table meals, with a garden right in the back parking lot (as wel las the owner's house)!  Dishes are inventive and fun, whether they be the appetizer selections or the main dishes.  Craft cocktails were also well put together and their Happy Hour menu is quite reasonable with plenty of choices (both meat and meatless options).  Experience here (from beginning to end) was good both times we've been.  A bit on the pricey side (for what it is), but I think that is probably offset by the quality of the ingredients.  well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Loved my acorn squash stuffed with mushroom risotto entree. Wonderful mix of flavors and very filling dish. Service was great and ambiance was date worthy. Would definitely come back next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this highly reviewed restaurant. We really admire their commitment to local vendors and non GMO foods. Went for dinner before Fleetwood Mac concert.  Service was friendly and prompt, atmosphere was comfortable. Great first impression.   Here is what we ordered;  Mushroom beignets; light, airy pretty tasty. A touch greasy, but hey, it's fried and I think they do it as well as it can be done. I thought these were good but could have used a little more mushroom filling.   My wife got the potato and ramp ravioli. The vegetables on top were perfection. The sauce was great. She felt the filling was a little bland and could have used some more seasoning.  I got the NY Strip sandwich. A well seasoned strip cooked to perfection over a perfectly butter toasted piece of thick cut bread. The sauce was awesome. The bleu cheese was pungent. The fries that came with it were very greasy and I did not care for them or finish them.  Also had the overpriced Spice Acres salad. Very small, light but flavorful salad with goat cheese. I enjoyed it.  They had two specials I wish we had ordered. The English pea risotto and the curried carrot soup both sounded interesting. Overall the food was good. I think Spice Kitchen needs a little more spice and the fried elements are just a little greasy. If I could do 3.5 stars I would. I will try it again and update my review. I really hope to change it to 4 stars because I really want to like this place more. I definitely like what they are trying to do.  If you like this place try Blue Door in Akron. Same ideas, just slightly better food IMO."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in Cleveland. Sunday Brunch & then Westside Market makes for a great day!"}
{"text":"I got the burger and two Old Fashions.. Service was quick. I sat at the bar. I wasn't that hungry but couldn't find a small dish that I wanted. That may just be me.  I ordered the burger and wasn't very satisfied. It cost about $15.  You expect an exceptional burger at the price. Sadly I was disappointed. As soon as it came, the bottom of the bun was soggy with grease. I ate it as it fell apart in my hand. After I paid the check I asked her to mention that to the chief... Suprisingly, she said, \"I know!\""}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Food and service is excellent. I highly recommend the Chef tasting along with the wine pairing if you want to treat yourself to a fancy dinner. It is worth every penny. I will definitely be returning to dine again."}
{"text":"I understand the Saturday night rush, being understaffed in the kitchen but when a bus boy mouths off to a table that has waited 2 hours for our food - that's completely unacceptable.   Most restaurants would try to comp out the entire meal after the wait time and the terrible service but no, we still paid for the drinks and appetizer.  Thanks, Spice.  Not suggesting this to anyone."}
{"text":"We joined friends for brunch and we all were pleasantly surprised by the interesting food choices and combinations. Mimosas were delicious! I love that the building is being repurposed into this really funky, eclectic, hip restaurant! I appreciate that the ingredients are locally sourced and as fresh as possible. Parking was a bit of an issue since it is located in residential area but we managed lol!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review only of my initial catering experience provided by Jess in helping me plan food and food presentation for my wedding.  Let's call a spade a spade...I can be one tough customer.  I expect people to be creative and go beyond what's printed on a menu.  I want people to challenge me back.  And I certainly want people to follow up in a timely manner.  Jess has nailed all three of these areas.  What impresses me about Spice in addition to their flavor profiles and creative menu items is their food presentation.  Their taste level is awesome, and they know how to artfully present food.  It's the best work I've seen in years.  Their menu is chock full of locally sourced items and I love this.  I didn't want to serve pedestrian food or mediocre-tasting food (so typical of weddings, right?), and Spice fits this bill beautifully.  In meetings with other folks I am working with to plan my wedding (floral designer, linens, cake, etc.) all of them know Jess and hold her and her work in high regard.  I am so excited for them to deliver one hell of a great food experience at my wedding!"}
{"text":"I am speechless.  If I were a musician, I would write a song about my experience. Or if I were a poet, I would write a poem.        First of all, the atmosphere and decor is so lovely, calming, very easy on the eyes. Everything was continuous and made sense decor-wise, loved the gorgeous mirrors that went all the way up to the ceiling, the lights, the....everything was beautiful.        Now the cocktails, I had the Sage is Just a Number, oh my god it was the most delicious cocktail I've ever had. It was so light and refreshing, it had sage infused gin, lemon, and luxado, I think? It was beautiful and SO good, and came in a cute little glass. I would have had another if it weren't $12, one was well worth it, but I couldn't bring myself to get another one.          On to the 'small plates,' our sweet and knowledgable server suggested that we get two small plates and an entree, all of which most people share. We got the seasonal ravioli, which had something similar to ricotta in it, I think, and was on delicious roasted and pureed yellow tomatoes, very good. The other small plate we got were the mushroom beignets. When I die and go to heaven, those beignets are going to be the first thing I eat. It was love at first bite. The mushrooms were pureed and mixed into the dough so you don't bite into a giant chunk mushroom, but you get this sweet sweet taste of the fresh mushrooms and homemade dough. It was paired with goat cheese creme fraiche, I could eat that creme fraiche by itself. I will never forget those beignets, I might propose to those beignets actually. Beignets, I love you.       Our 'substantial,' or entree, was the salmon. It came with a horseradish puree, charred greens (I think), and roasted beets. Oh my god, all of those flavors, what a symphony in my mouth. The horseradish puree was perfect, it was not overwhelming at all and tasted so good with the charred greens and roasted beets. It was an emotional experience, tasting all those harmonious flavors at once.       Lastly, for dessert we had the pork lard gingersnap ice cream sandwich and the home slice (which was the chef's whimsy of cake for the evening). As if this food experience wasn't enough of an emotional rollercoaster, the gingersnap ice cream sandwich took the last of my breath right out of me. Yes, the cake was incredible, but that ice cream sandwich....maybe I'll propose to her instead of those beignets. It was smoky, sour, sweet, but not too sweet. Just hitting the high notes of all your taste buds, incredible.       So dear reader, if you are looking for a moral to this story, here it is: this restaurant works hard to make you connect with your food, sourcing the ingredients locally (nearly all is grown in the Cuyahoga National Park in Brecksville, one of the only National Parks to allow such a thing), and boy do they deliver. Each item now is a distinct memory in my mind. P.S. get the Sage is Just a Number cocktail, Mushroom Beignets, and the Pork Lard Gingersnap Ice Cream Sandwich. It is pricey, but so so worth it."}
{"text":"Spice K+B is an amazing staple of the Cleveland brunch scene. I visited on a late Saturday morning, and it was packed with people from nearly every demographic - young, old, groups of hungover friends, couples, old friends catching up, etc. It really felt like being in the heart of Cleveland.   The décor and the ambiance is untouchable. It has a Southern/East Coast charm, decorated with flowers and amazing wooden tables. Our coffee was served in mismatched cups that looked like they had been thrifted (mine was a Christmas cup) - an amazing touch! The waitress was extremely attentive, had tons of recommendations, and kept my cup full. The dining room has a large window that provides great natural light, which is perfect for those Instagram photos!   The menu was incredible - it took us a while to decide because everything looked so yummy. We ordered the monkey bread to start off with, and OMG. If you ever need to absolutely order something, this is it. It was AMAZING. The flavor of the day was carrot, and I really just want to go back and try every seasonal flavor. The outside was perfectly crunchy and the inside was perfectly gooey, soft, and dense. There was a touch of citrus, and it came in the perfect portion for two. You NEED this monkey bread in your life! I promise.   For the entree, I ordered the salmon benedict, and my boyfriend ordered the mushroom hash with brisket. We recommend both, but as is indicated in the name of the establishment, the food is seasoned so well that it kinda burns after eating it for a while. I couldn't finish my potatoes (which are AMAZING: crispy and soft at the same time) because they burned the roof of my mouth. Yet, the food presentation was incredible, and you can tell that the chef takes great pride in his/her work. If you stop by their Instagram (@spicekandb), you can see some of the creations whipped up in the story. It's really a foodie heaven here!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be passing though Cleveland and had the chance to eat at Spice Kitchen + Bar. Ingredients are sourced from the owner's farm located inside Cuyahoga National Park and other local farms so \"fresh\" is an understatement. I love food and love to eat and the meal I had at Spice is one of the best I've ever eaten! Started with the polenta + chickpea fries and I could have eaten a basket full of these. Next was the grouper brandade and again I could have eaten a tub of this. The pickle plate was really unique and delicious. The beet + radish salad was perfection with just enough dressing to accent the taste of super fresh veggies. My buddy was kind enough to share a taste of his chicken confit with its delectable mole sauce and I was feeling jealous because it was outstanding until I tried my lamb shank and was blown away leaving NOTHING on my plate except the bone. I also had a seasonal cocktail that I forget what was in it, but WOW!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  It's great to know that they have their own gardens and chickens!  None of this frozen, reheat, throw some sauce on it, call it a day restaurant.  Everything was awesome!!!! Fresh Food, great presentations"}
{"text":"Just an ok restaurant. Not too many options for food, especially for vegetarians. Food portions were also extremely small and staff is not too familiar with how big their meals are. I ordered a starter and asked if it was enough to feed one person and our server said probably. When I received my \"meal\" there was a tiny sample portion of food. Way too pricey for what they have to offer. The thing I liked most was the drink options. Lots of unique drinks to try."}
{"text":"Not an extensive menu, but plenty of great choices. It was hard for me to decide what to order. Split Apple Cinnamon Beignets and they were good, nothing super special. The Dixie Benedict was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Spice is always great. Decent service, fantastic food. Everything is fresh, locally sourced and most importantly delicious. Something as simple as their pickled plate was fab. Have never had a bad meal. Oh also-any of their speciality dinners are amazing. Went for a wine dinner and it was outstanding."}
{"text":"Such a neat spot! We sat at the bar and enjoyed the \"bartender's choice\" cocktails during their Saturday happy hour and a cheese board. The bartender was SO helpful while helping us build our cheeseboard and the accompaniments / presentation was amazing! Great find in a not so great area but totally worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Both in food and cocktail the freshness can be tasted. This is one place I would stress to not alter your menu selection, for every plate is executed perfectly. The space is calm and relaxing perfect date night or intimate conversation."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Had a rustic, romantic, casual feel to the place.  With a name like \"Spice\", you would figure the food have a lot of flavor and use spices that you may not have heard of or considered using.  However, it was not the case.  The food was straightforward with little spice use, and instead it let the food broadcast its natural flavors and aromas.  We started with the polenta chickpea fries....AMAZING!!  They were really good...I wish I had the recipe that way I can make them whenever I wanted to.  We split the charcoal chicken (they charged some extra money for splitting it for us), which was decent but didn't really wow me :(     Overall, the place was decent and good spot for a date.  But I did leave thinking I could've saved money and had a better time across the street at Happy Dog."}
{"text":"We were recently in communication with Jess in the catering department for our upcoming wedding next fall at a location in which an off-site cater was needed.  Though in the end we signed a contract with a venue who had in house catering I was very impressed with Spice of Life Catering.  Not only was Jess prompt in her replies; but she helped guide me through the process (which seemed very daunting at the time!) and made me feel very confident that if we went forward with them for catering services that we would be well cared for at our wedding.  I couldn't recommend them more highly and should I need a catered event in the future there is no doubt that my first call would be to Jess.  Thanks again for everything!"}
{"text":"I give five stars for the food and drink, four for decor (I'm just not a big fan of the burlap and Mason jar vibe), and three stars for service. We had an excellent experience with the food.  I got the burger (unique and enjoyable sauce and cheese combo) and my husband the scallops, which he liked. Unfortunately, our server was cold and inattentive. Could have just been that he was juggling too many tables, but it definitely downgraded our experience."}
{"text":"Wish I would have taken pictures of my food! It was amazing! I had salmon and hub had beef. They were both amazing. The atmosphere is good. The service is thoughtful. Somehow our appetizer order never got placed but we got complimentary dessert! It was so good! We had the chocolate waffle and some chocolate marshmallow thing!? This place is pretty pricey to eat here frequently but it's is so worth the $!"}
{"text":"GET TOGETHER - A serious health scare can put things in perspective. A mother of a childhood friend is recovering and being three thousand miles away left me feeling helpless. I hadn't seen her in over thirty five years nor my buddy in twenty three and this had to change. When I returned home to Michigan last Friday, I had to make a trip down to Cleveland to see her. After the visit, her son and I went to dinner at one of his 'favorite new restaurants'.  Parking in the lot, they've checked off one of my gauges of a good restaurant experience. A smoker is set up in the parking lot and it smelled GOOODDDDD...an interesting space on the corner, you step up into an open restaurant with the bar on your right and the dining area through an opening around to the left. Trendy visually, a brick accent wall and nice fixtures with wood floors create a contemporary look and feel. Tall windows let natural light inside and you can also see into the kitchen from the street on approach.  Our service started with an attentive who told the story of the restaurant's philosophy (farm to table, local ingredients and an evolving, seasonal menu) with a little bit of the arrogance of a hipster establishment. We had a varied set of dietary requirements: 1) a low-salt diet; 2) digestive sensitivities; 3) a pre-teen; and an elderly guest.  Our choices were (in reverse order) - Potato + Ramp Soup ($8), Dry Aged Beef Burger ($18) one for both the pre-teen and elderly guest, Ansen Mill Rice Grits ($23),  Market Fish (Salmon) and a New Creations hanger steak ($28). My hosts started with the bread service containing a bread with heirloom grain, a locally grown vegetable of ramp in pesto form, a cultured butter dusted with black sea salt and a seasonal tomato jam.  A highlight of the visit was the handling customer service issue, that is often mishandled but in this case was not. One of the burgers was cooked a little too rare, although someone in the party had asked for medium well. Our server Jeanna, who did a great job of describing the menu also had the unappealing quality of talking down or feeling impatient to customers with pretentious 'restaurant talk' -- telling our guest who said she didn't want to see pink if possible \"the chef cooks this medium rare\"-- instead of reassuring or coaxing an undecided customer to a meal they'd enjoy. She reluctantly took it back to fix and came back to mention the chef is making a new burger for us.  The rest of us finished our meals by the time the burger came back BUT in the meantime, a manager (not Jeanna) came by and apologized for the delay AND offered her a free desert. When we asked Jeanna for it at meal's end she had no idea what we were talking about. She checked, brought out the desert to go and despite this, the manager's gesture made things right!  My meal was the hanger steak cooked to medium rare perfection, an arugula salad, naan bread and pickled red onions garnished with dill. Very tasty and well balanced meal of sweet and savory flavors on gathered together on a large round plate that screams high end. Compliments to a great effort by the chef and his vision. Reminds me of home (in Los Angeles).  Prices were on the high side but you can work around the higher priced items if on a budget and definitely perfect for a 30-year reunion."}
{"text":"So amazing! Such a lovely brunch, plus the interior and atmosphere were amazing. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. Beautiful presentation and such kind service. Already want to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my meals at Spice...as an Ohio City resident I can say it is hands down my favorite restaurant in town.  This past weekend I had the pleasure of having spice cater my mothers birthday brunch at my house.  It was spectacular!  Jess, who coordinated the event, was more than helpful and extremely organized.  She literally took care of every little detail so that my friends, family, and myself could just enjoy the fabulous food and atmosphere that spice created for my mothers birthday.  I loved that the entire meal was prepared right in our kitchen by the chef Ryan (who was sweet enough to explain to my kids what ingredients he was using and even letting them nibble on some of the food while he cooked)!!  For brunch we had stuffed french toast with jam and maple syrup, breakfast burritos (made to order), cheesy mushroom grits, potato hash, and local cottage cheese with fresh berries.  We also had them prepare a meat and cheese tray and also freshly made pita chips with hummus and blue cheese dip for us to snack on through out the day.  The table that Jess set up to display the food was breath taking, it was so pretty I almost didn't even want to mess it up by eating the food...but it smelled to fantastic to not get a huge plateful!  It was worth every single penny and I can not wait to use them again for our next catered event!  Thank you spice for making my mothers birthday absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Spice has been a Cleveland favorite for years. But this is my first time for brunch. What a great way to experience their creative and fresh menu at such an affordable price. Still thinking about that smoked salmon benedict! Al fresco on the back patio is a pretty great way to spend part of a summer Sunday  afternoon."}
{"text":"The bar was really good. The drinks were delicious and reasonably priced. However, the prices for dinner were pretty steep and you dont get much food. It was really cozy and intimate."}
{"text":"Had the great opportunity to eat at Spice a few weeks ago on a layover in Cleveland. I have to say that the food and staff were amazing here. The freshness and uniqueness of the food was on par with any of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. Everything you bite into has a flavor of having been recently picked, killed and prepared. The decor and setting are also very inviting. A twist and combination of modern, rustic, clean, and inviting. Continue the great work Spice, I plan on making this a normal stop on my layovers."}
{"text":"After a day of exploring Cleveland, my sweetheart and I popped in for happy hour on the patio a few days ago. I had the stuffed avocado and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, while my sweetheart opted for the carrot cake and Irish coffee. Savory and sweet... we balance each other perfectly. Everything was delicious. The toasted quinoa on the warm stuffed avocado was a revelation! I must have exclaimed, \"Quinoa can taste GOOD!\" a dozen times. The wine was a perfect complement to the creamy, buttery goodness in front of me. My sweetheart proclaimed the carrot cake to be as good on the sweet spectrum as mine was on the savory. Better, even, as my avocado could have been improved by a lighter touch with the mustard that formed the foundation. The wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive or overbearing. We are looking forward to returning for a full meal soon!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to experience Spice. Atmosphere is amazing. Menu is limited but substantial. I was so sure that dinner would be phenomenal but service was painfully slow and far too descriptive, drinks were okay, and the food was very sub par. I ordered the special, pumpkin ravioli with chestnut cream sauce. For some reason one side of the ravioli was browned which made the pasta awkwardly chewy. The cream sauce was a bit chalky from the chestnuts and they said the pumpkin was seasoned with rosemary which was undetectable. Tasted like a frozen meal that I could have purchased for a quarter of the price. I am so angry that I spent what I did there. Very, very overpriced. No thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent farm to table  restaurant with a wide variety of dishes on the menu. We went on a Thursday evening and sat at the bar as we didn't have a reservation. Nightly promotion was half price wine bottles and we split something recommended by the bartender. The happy hour menu listed other offerings with reduced prices - we first tried the goat cheese gnudi (similar to gnocchi) with beet purée and pickled apples. Amazing. Other two dishes were the seasonal flatbread (ham, cheese, divine crust) and pork dumplings (rich, complex flavor) The service was friendly, helpful and efficient. I'll definitely return as there were many menu items that I still wanted to taste."}
{"text":"It seems like whenever we think about eating out on the Near Westside, our thoughts usually turn to Luxe but then we are reminded of Spice and last week we were glad that we paid this place a visit.  A great patio -- after all, there's only 5-6 weeks left in the Cleveland patio season -- featuring pots of aromatic herbs along with large umbrellas to keep back the blazing sun is a good start.  The cocktail menu had several inventive options -- Jeannene had one involving strawberry infused vodka -- but I went with my usual Old-Fashioned though our server reminded me of the option of rye instead of bourbon -- something I enjoy but rarely think about as I've become accustomed to restaurant bars not realizing that's a thing.  The menu isn't that large -- there were 13 appetizers but only 6 entrees -- but everything we chose was excellent. We shared a cheese board and I usually judge that on the accompanying items instead of the actual cheeses since they are almost always the same -- a soft cheese, a bleu cheese and a hard cheese. This one was no different though there was the addition of goat cheese pearls floating in olive oil and peppercorns and the cheeses came with a tangy strawberry dipping sauce, a fresh piece of honeycomb (loved by a bee that had joined our table), dried apricots and plenty of sweetly coated almonds for texture along with the crostinis.  I was disappointed that they were out of the walleye even though we were there at 5:30 on a Saturday but they more than made up for it with a halibut over golden rice that was one of their specials. This might have been one of the most perfectly cooked halibuts I've ever had as the outside was an ideal golden crispiness yet the inside was still very moist. I barely had to use my knife to cut it. The moistness was echoed by the fluffy rice and pieces of mango (I think) that were in it. Along the edge of the plate was just a touch of a creamy white sauce that added to the summery lightness of the dish instead of drowning it.  Meanwhile, Jeannene opted for two appetizers for her main course -- raving for days about how good her roasted corn agnolotti tasted while just being OK with the mushroom beignets.  So this meal will help us to keep Spice in mind the next time we are looking for a place around Gordon Square."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. The toast of the day was an ancient grain with a smoked duck spread and poach egg was probably the best breakfast item I have had in years!!!  If they have it get it!"}
{"text":"I have been here too many times to count. It is truly one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Spice Kitchen during restaurant week. The service was outstanding and the food was AMAZING. Farm to table restaurants are awesome, and they fact they most of the food used at Spice comes from farms close to to Cleveland makes it even better. We will definitely be back to try to tasting menu!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed breakfast on the outdoor back patio. Then environment on the patio allows you to escape the urban reality and transports you into a rural garden like setting. They offer many farm to table options. We enjoyed the potato hash and the omelette of the day. The added brisket to the hash was amazing. Without the brisket the dish was not something I would likely order again. The hash was kind of bland. The omelette was very good although the chorizo was scarce. The service was great and our overall the experience was positive. We will likely return to try their dinner menu sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I met my girlfriend here for drinks on a Saturday night.  We didn't have reservations but the hostess ushered me directly to a table.  I ordered a drink for myself and my friend.  Our waitress was nice & didn't bombard us while we chatted.  We ordered the cheese plate which was presented beautifully and full of divine local cheeses.  I ordered the beet salad which was also very good.  My friend ordered the  risotto.  She said it was perfect!   I enjoyed my \"meal\" here and I hope that Spice manages to stick around longer than the others who have come and gone from this location."}
{"text":"I ate way too much because the menu looked so good I couldn't decide on just one thing.  I started with the winter squash flatbread. Then I moved to the butternut squash, pine nut, and goat cheese veggie dish.  For my third course I got the pork dumplings.  And finally for dessert I had the mocha cheese cake with whiskey whipped cream.  I will be back in a few weeks to do the same thing with their brunch menu."}
{"text":"We went for a special night out with 12 adults.  We had family in from LA and Dallas.  All are used to great food.  This held up to their standards and then some!  This was my first time going, but I had heard lots of good things.    We all started with a cocktail.  Everyone trying out the different drinks.  Then on to a good wine selection.  We ordered at least 10 appetizers.  We loved everyone of them.  Then we ordered probably 5-6 unique dinners between the 12 of us.  Everyone loved their dish.  We had between all of us a couple of the duck specials, a couple of the Duck burgers, the veggie dish, several walleye dishes, the guinea hen ravioli dish.  Everyone truly enjoyed their dish.    Then we got a couple of the desserts.  We did the s'mores and the Rhubarb crisp.  Everyone at the table smelled the S'mores.  The camp fire smell was great.  However, of everything we ate, we liked dessert the least.    The only reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5 was our waitress.  It was like she couldn't be bothered to help us.  She never even came by to ask how the food was.  She didn't even give us the appetizer special until after we ate our appetizers.  My favorite, other than just the look of disdain she seemed to care with her, was when we were getting our entrees.  we had about 5 of the 12 entrees delivered.  She dropped off the 5th and went to the table next to us to take there order.  Granted, I know she had help getting the food out, but, this is your table, she should ensure everyone gets their food.  We ended up waiting on the 12th entree a few extra minutes after everyone finally got theirs.  My other favorite was that we ordered appetizers in sections of the table so we could all have things we liked in our area.  We had several orders of humus down a very long table.  She had them but it all on one tray.  Made no sense.  All in all, we loved it.  I would absolutely recommend it.  I would ask for a different waitress the next time though, or hope she was in a happier mood."}
{"text":"I just have to give a shout out to the wonderful folks at Spice Kitchen & Bar for the Santa brunch they hosted this past Sunday. It was so wonderful to have a holiday event in a small, relaxed venue, with wonderful food and a very nice, laid-back Santa. There were Bloody Marys for the grown ups and a cookie decorating station for the kids. (And beignets, gingerbread pancakes, southwestern eggs benedict, mushroom hash with shortribs. Sigh.) At a time when everyone is talking about restaurants shunning kids, it was nice to have ours so warmly embraced. No wonder the Bebenroths are on the 5 Most Interesting Chefs list! Best part of our holidays so far. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Service. Great food. Great drinks. Can't ask for much more. They even have a stand at the peninsula farmers market with burritos that will literally blow your mind. Worth the trip in any direction. This place makes my spring go BOING! Love the changing menu. I could go on forever.   SPRING SEED-"}
{"text":"After our last experience at Spice we were invited back to give it another go. While a bit reluctant we decided to try one last time.  This time it was like a totally different place.    We were greeted promptly and seated as soon as we got there. Our server was at our table within a minute to tell us about the daily specials.  I went with one of the drink special that was wonderful (vodka and orange something? I forget exactly).  Drink was cold and delivered promptly.    For our meal, we started with the pork belly which was fantastic! Could have eaten a plate of the orange whip it was served with.  Followed that up with the tomato salad. Would have like a little more tomato but the ones on it were amazing and you could tell they were farm fresh!  My husband went with the walleye which I did try and was good.  I went with the corn agnolotti which was AMAZING! It was only available as a small plate though which made me sad as I would have loved to feast on it!  It was sweet and tender with a bit of greens to compliment that and just amazing.  Our server was attentive and prompt, completely different experience from our last visit.   We appreciated the opportunity to give it another try and it will be a place we consider when given the opportunity to go out.   Thanks for a wonderful meal with great service."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the following for our 'date night' on March 27, 2012:  Cheeseboard Bibb salad Lamb shank w/ greens, mashers, & pickled squash Steelhead flatbread  We were pleasantly filled.  Steelhead Flatbread was our favorite, followed by the salad which was composed of crisp ultra-fresh greens.  Nice tight menu so hard to go wrong.  Lots of daily specials focused on seasonal eating. Knowledgeable and attentive wait staff.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing atmosphere!  They were understaffed tonight so service was a little slow.  They were very apologetic and friendly."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior decoration.  Intimate atmosphere with a good balance of classy/trendy and casual.  Good quality of food with the perfect seasoning and classic presentation!  I had market fish (salmon for tonight) and brandy something for desert  (cannot recall the exact name. It's chocolate based and come in a glass.  Good for two person to share), sooooo delicious!!  My friend and I had a great time!!!   We are first time there but it definitely scored top on my list.   Also they seems to have an amazing brunch menu.  Cannot wait to go back there and try more.  They also offer happy hours with different promotion each night."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience. The incredible combinations of flavors and textures were inventive and extremely appetizing. I was there with a large group and everyone was raving about their meal. From start to finish everything was superb!"}
{"text":"I've now been to this place twice - on a Wednesday night and on a Friday night. I was originally going to give 3 stars just because their food is good but a little pricey (however if you notice on their menu, most of their ingredients are grown in Cuyahoga valley so that's pretty stellar!). On our most recent visit, I bumped it up solely based on customer service. We chose to sit at the bar so we chatted a bit with the bartenders and they were so pleasant and accommodating! We had a couple of special requests and they didn't seem put out at all. They even remembered us from the last time we were there which was nice.  Spice has delicious, unique cocktails and a great wine and beer selection. They also have great happy hour deals that I recommend fully. Tuesday's are $10 burger and beer, Wednesday is all day happy hour, and Thursday's are 1/2 priced wine and cheese. Definitely go during a happy hour!  Their atmosphere is dim and cozy but it's a good sized restaurant so feel free to bring a group. Overall, we won't be going there all the time due to the price but we will absolutely be coming back for the happy hours or for a more special occasion!"}
{"text":"It's hard for my expectations to be exceeded when my expectations had already been so high, but Spice did so with a wonderfully delicious Valentines Day dinner. Everything about our first experience was great, from the friendly staff to the beautiful and relaxed atmosphere to the delicious and well prepared food.  This meal was one for the books. We opted for their 4 course tasting menu, one appetizer, two salads, two entrees, and a dessert to share. For our starter, we got the hummus platter, which was delicious. I loved the presentation and that veggies were served alongside the pita. Crushed almonds were also served on the platter, and provided a perfect crunch. That's one thing I noticed about the meal, they put a lot of time and effort into all the elements of every dish. Something as simple as almonds with hummus to provide a little texture shows how much care and thought these chefs have put into every dish.  For the salad course I got the kale and apple salad which was dressed with a whole grain mustard dressing- awesome. My date had the fried oyster salad, which he also loved.  The main courses, and the true stunners in my opinion were the lamb for me, and the lobster ravioli for him. My lamb was divine- so tender and flavorful and satisfyingly savory. It was accompanied by bitter greens, which provided a needed contrast. My date loved his lobster ravioli, and described it as rich and delicious. We both cleaned our plates. For dessert we chose \"dessert sushi\" and fun, creative, unexpectedly delicious final course. It was beautifully presented and tasted awesome.  I'd also like to mention that I can't have any dairy products and the entire staff was incredibly accommodating to this restriction. Our server was extremely patient and took time to consult with the kitchen about what they could prepare for me. I was able to order from their regular menu with only slight substitutions. I really appreciated the extra step they took for me.  One of the best meals I've had so far living in Cleveland. I absolutely loved the seasonal, local approach they take with everything they do. I'm looking forward to coming back every season and experiencing new menus."}
{"text":"**BEWARE THIS IS A LONG REVIEW**   First let me start by saying that this is the best restaurant on Detroit avenue hands down!! From the moment I walked by earlier on in the day and was able to see into the kitchen to coming back, because my boyfriends daughter had recommended we try it, I was blown away!! To see the kitchen come alive when we came back for dinner in the evening was magical. The kitchen seemed so calm and the staff just flowed so well. We were greeted very warmly by the hostess and were given a table in the bar area on a Saturday evening without reservations for four people right away!! Our waiter/bartender was phenomenal as well!! He was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and even made me my own cocktails because I couldn't for the the life of me figure out what I wanted to drink besides scotch( I really wanted a scotch cocktail)!! He definitely didn't leave me disappointed with his concoctions he came up with for me!! Very accommodating staff for last minute group of people and needy diners, such as myself. We ordered a variety of starters and it when everything came out we immediately dug into everything!! The presentation of every dish was on point!! The Brussels served on the stalk with that aioli they make was to die for, no doubt!! Such a unique way to start my boyfriend's birthday dinner with friends and family!! The atmosphere was simple yet elegant and wasn't over the top as to not distract away any attention from the food!! The concept of farm to table is one that has been perfected by the head Chef!! I follow him on Instagram and it is really cool to see where your food is coming from and to see how passionate he is about maintaining a high quality of produce that he chooses to use in his kitchen!! The menu is simple yet complex on its own!! It showcases the kitchens techniques!! I can't wait to come back and try another special!!"}
{"text":"There was nothing to find fault with here. Everything was really amazing. Maybe... my favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. Not a huge number of vegetarian options but what I had was delicious. The avocado toast was tasty. The beignets were a sweet way to start the meal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The space is beautifully designed."}
{"text":"My husband and i went here last friday 2/17 about 6pm and the place was about half full. we did not have reservations but were seated in the bar area.  the decor was very on par with other rest in this area.  we started out with the trout flatbread that the waitress told us was smoked.  the trout was more like lox and not smoked. my husband enjoyed this alone as i would not eat it.  as we were waiting for our entree's 2 other couples were seated on each side of us.  the chef came out and greated both cuples as friends.  while we were still waiting for our entree's, appetizers started pouring out for these 2 couples \"the chef wanted you to try these\". all the while i am waiting and hungrier by the moment. (this really pissed off my husband and I - maybe the comp meals should be seated in a special place away from paying customers) i asked the waitress if the \"chef\" was out talking to friends, who was in the kitchen cooking and she responded that there were several chefs back there!  after about 30 minutes, we recieved our entrees.  for $12.00 I got the risotto which had no meat and was about a 1 cup portion. it came in a small soup bowl and was undercooked not to mention very runny and i did not even get a spoon to eat it with.  my husband got the sea bass which was about a 4oz portion atop squash puree for $24.00. it was fishy and dry (overcooked). maybe the chef was busy with preparing his friends meals.  when we left, we were still hungry and had spent $54.00 before tip for these 2 \"entrees\" , 1 appetizer and 2 beers. not to mention the place was emptier than when we came in at 7pm on a friday night.  why could we not have been seated in the main dining area? may have been a little warmer too.  for these reviews, this place should be packed on a friday at this time just like XYZ and Happy Dog across the street!  we live downtown and frequent many rest in gordon park, downtown, ohio city and tremont. this has been the absolute worst meal for the money spent. we will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here recently on a date with my husband! We enjoyed our time here at Spice and thought everything was pretty solid. Spice has a wonderful vision and mission to use as much local goods as possible. Turns out Ohio is a great place to do this with all our amazing local farms!  Our favorite appetizer was a special: fresh halibut chowder with lobster oil. MM. It was good! Please make this a regular menu item! The flavor was really great. 5 for the chowder.  We also had a 3 local-mushroom pesto flatbread with goat cheese. The mushrooms were oyster, chantrelle, and one more I can't remember...the mushrooms were fresh and good tasting. 4 for the flatbread.  I ordered the Spice Acres Polenta with ratatouille and eggplant puree, which I think was a vegan dish. The polenta was fried rather than creamy, a good complement to the puree and ratatouille. The eggplant had a pretty strong flavor, but it was intriguing enough to keep eating.  My husband ordered the special - fresh trout (that day!) with sweet potato puree. This was amazing!!! They gave him the entire fish -- something you don't see very often except in authentic Chinese restaurants (mmm). I loved that they did this because I feel that we were able to enjoy every aspect of the fish, from the regular filet to the cheeks, etc. It was also served like someone had just caught it, fried it up, and served it. So great.   Overall, we enjoyed our time. One thing I noted..they don't give complimentary bread, so be sure to order some appetizers if you are coming in hungry. Other than that, be enjoy the local and fresh dishes!"}
{"text":"Not horrible but not amazing.  I'm willing to give it another try because I really want to like it.    Our plans changed so we arrive 45 minutes before our reservation.  It was a weekday and the place was almost empty so we didn't think it would be a problem but the hostess insisted we wait at the bar and have a drink before being seated.  We thought that was a little odd but obliged, after all, there was a happy hour (not available in the dining area).  Happy hour was nice - they had an amazing $5 Rosé.  The bar, which seemed to have 3 bartenders and was dead, took about 15 minutes to make my husband's drink - he chose the \"bartender's choice\" although the bartender didn't know what it was.  He drank it.  It was OK, although we are still unsure about what it was.    Finally our table was ready - there were only 4 other tables occupied so again, it was weird we had to wait.  Maybe they only had one server and needed the extra time to catch up?  The server was super sweet but didn't offer us the specials until we asked.  She gave us each a complimentary glass of champagne as it was our anniversary, which was really nice.    The food was good, but the menu was a bit more limited than I was expecting.  Due to an allergy, my husband was limited to the burger - not the fancy meal he had hoped for on our anniversary, but it was fine.  He likes burgers.  Unfortunately the burger came covered in his allergen, which he had specifically discussed with the server.  They had to remake it.  It took so long they had to remake my meal as well.  Maybe I'm a diva but I didn't want to eat my meal in front of my husband while he waited for his.    The remade meals finally came.  The food was good.  Not great.  For the trouble they gave us a complimentary allergen-free dessert, which was really good service, although it didn't taste too good.  They also removed his dinner from the bill without us asking, also really above and beyond of management.    So, I give 3 stars for the decent food and the complimentary champagne and the proactive management for removing an item from the bill.  I deduct 2 stars for the weird start with the hostess and the bar drink experience and for the food not being as amazing as all the other reviews will have you believe.  Also for making our anniversary a little awkward.  I look forward to giving it another go, maybe in the summer when their gorgeous patio is open and on a weekend, when they are more prepared with exciting dinner specials."}
{"text":"I went here after finding an apartment in Cleveland. The food was really good. We got the cornbread and chickpea fries for apps and they were delicious. The cornbread is served with some sort of rosemary bacon butter which I didn't eat because I'm not a bacon person. The cornbread is enough for 3-4 people (think a 6\" circle of it).  I got the Bibb salad and the potato stuffed ravioli and spinach puree, both cooked well and in season. A friend of mine and my mom ordered off the restaurant week menu and weren't disappointed. The apple cobbler is amazing and the ice cream with it is home made! Definitely a restaurant to go back to, but it is a little bit pricey end.    The service was good and we had everything come out the way we wanted!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour!! My friend and I came here on a weekday afternoon and we were seated at the bar immediately. I ordered the special happy hour cocktail, which was a bourbon cranberry with a hint of honey. For $6, this drink was totally worth it! It had a kick of bourbon at the end of each sip, but the sweetness of the cranberry balanced this kick perfectly. I highly recommend this! We also ordered the mushroom beignets, which are to DIEEEE FOR. There is a crispy outer shell with a soft and creamy center. The dipping sauce was a heavenly mixture of honey and goat cheese. MMmmm!   Price is fair and service is wonderful, so I'm definitely coming back again for their amazing happy hour deal!"}
{"text":"I had not previously eaten at Spice, although I had attended a number of events catered by Spice, and at each one, the food was spectacular.  (A private party at the Spice Farm was especially wonderful.)  So I was really looking forward to a Saturday dinner at the restaurant itself.  The menu is not extensive but does offer interesting and eclectic selections.  I am fussy about fish entrée.  After college, I spent a summer working on a fishing \"factory trawler\" in Alaska -- and in addition to incredibly hard work and marginal slave pay -- we got to eat the best fresh fish, expertly prepared, forever-after making it difficult for me to be satisfied with restaurant-prepared fish dishes in the Midwest.  With that background, I nevertheless ordered the Spice pan-seared Halibut, knowing that Spice had pleasantly surprised me in the past.  OMG!  That piece of fish was the BEST fish dish I ever ate, including anything I ate fresh in Alaska.  I could not believe it!  It was simply perfect.  I will return to Spice again and again.  And the fact that it is a farm-to-table venue, is simply another plus in a wonderful offering."}
{"text":"First time dinning at Spice Kitchen and l'm glad we decided to try it out. We arrived a little after 7pm and were seated right away with no wait. Our waitress had waters and menus out quickly and our drinks were served up timely, I went with the one of the drink specials a bourbon and Campari concoction that was way to easy to drink  while my wife went with a glass of wine.  The mushroom beignets were first on our list as appetizers, Crispy brown on the outside and tasty all around with a nice side dipping sauce. My dinner choice was the Pork Belly  while my wife had the Salmon. The Pork Belly was amazingly good and the side of greens and root veggies paired and cut the fatty goodness of the Pork just right. My wife enjoyed her Salmon and the bite I stole from her very good.  We'll definitely go back for brunch/dinner with plans of running through the small plate choices, if I don't go for the Pork Belly again. Service, food quality, taste and ambiance puts Spice Kitchen on my list of places I would recommend and return to for dinner."}
{"text":"We were very happy with our meal here. While expensive, everything tasted great and we got some unique flavors. Our party decided to go the route of sharing several small plates and then a few of the entrees. I loved the pickle board because they had so much variety of things I would think to crunch on...pickled water melon rinds? Squash? Really satisfying. You could taste the veggie through the briney goodness still. Another standout was the charred broccoli--if they are serving it the Calabrian chilies, it might be too spicy for you, but spicy is my middle name. I am a definite carnivore but am just realizing my favorites were the vegetarian options. For richer apps, the mushroom beignets were creamy and smooth, the chicken livers were also very nice. I have to admit, the small plates were so good, they almost didn't compare to the (completely fine) entrees; I barely remember what we got for them (besides the French fries--WOW!). My only critique was that service was pretty slow. It took forever to get food and drinks (not why I can't remember the entrees, I actually wasn't drinking alcohol myself!) We were fine taking time to visit with each other, but having a drink to sip on while waiting for food or to order food I think is important."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to have to write this review! But we had a really bad experience at Spice this weekend. Spice did not deliver what I am sure they are capable of! First off - the space itself is AWESOME and so pretty. Gorgeous decor and ambiance, great design and beautiful patio space - I love how they decorated and it really is the cutest little brunch spot. However, the service was really bad. Worst I've had in a while. That's the only way to put it honestly. Our waitress was nice and apologetic, but the ball was dropped over and over. Two people in our group ordered bloody Mary's that took over 20 minutes to get and we had to ask for them again to get them to come out. Another person ordered an appetizer of monkey bread and it didn't come out until AFTER all of our food did. I ordered the breakfast burger cooked MEDIUM and it came out nearly still moo-ing (photo attached). Two others ordered burgers not prepared correctly but they didn't ask about theirs since we felt like we were already complaining so much and it was awkward. I got a new one but took it home since we had to leave town and had a long drive ahead (visiting Cleveland for a wedding). What was truly unacceptable is that someone in our group has a SEVERE dairy allergy that literally could kill him (not exaggerating) and so when he ordered the hash, he explained no butter or any dairy could contaminate it and they said no problem. His food came out with Parmesan on top... had he not noticed, we would've been rushing him to the hospital because his allergy is really that serious. Again, they brought out a new one... but it was bad. I ordered coffee and waitress told me that my Bloody Mary was being taken off my bill... that would've been great, but I didn't order one! Since we had a party of 9, 20% gratuity was automatically included. I wouldn't have left that if I had a choice. It would have been nice for a chef or manager to come apologize to our table, since our waitress was clearly overwhelmed with all the problems we had start to finish. I am from out of town so I won't be back, but if I lived in Cleveland, I wouldn't be going back. Very sad to have had this experience!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was absolutely fantastic and the drinks were excellent. The 3-star rating is more about portions. We first enjoyed the pickled plate and selected cheeses for our table of four. The baby sized portions, meaning not even a full ring of pickled onion was delicately shared among the four of us. While there were other dainty portions of rhubarb, onion flowers, and such it seemed barely enough to share, especially since we also shared a selection of 3 cheeses. Each cheese portion was likely no more than an ounce.  Again for four, we each had all but a taste.   Three at our table ordered the walleye. Now, we are familiar with Great Lake walleye so to have a portion the size of an iPhone was somewhat of a letdown. The presentation was exquisite and the flavors were amazing. Good thing we had ordered extra asparagus.   Lastly, our server really played up the farm raised pork, to the extent that I was hoping for short ribs or a nice pork chop would be on the menu. Surprisingly, there was no pork to be had.   Overall, food and cocktails A+, portions C-"}
{"text":"Our visit to Spice Kitchen was simply a great experience. Our waiter, Robert, was not only attentive throughout the evening but also particularly helpful as we made cocktail and meal choices to start our experience.  I enjoyed finding a winter beer from Anderson Valley to go with my meal that started with a flavorful salmon chowder. I followed that with the \"porkstrami burger\". Great sandwich but the real winner was the accompanying coriander fries that were crisp outside and fluffy inside. Good stuff.  Everyone else enjoyed their meal and agreed that service, food and atmosphere all add up to a must return visit."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that the Toast Special was one of the best things I've ever eaten. No joke! I want to go back to spice just for that! House made brioche, dill cream cheese, arugula, fried capers and cured salmon. Absolutely amazing!   Everything else about our brunch was A-ok! (Hence my rating.) Entrees were tasty. I would have loved the Korean waffle to be crispier and less heavy. The mushroom hash was a little dry; my fried egg was overcooked and not runny. Service was incredibly slow. Coffee was plentiful.   All in all, I'd come back just for that toast.... I'll see ya again, Spice kitchen."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday for lunch and it was delicious!  We had excellent service and great recommendations for food.  Both of our dishes were amazing - delicious, flavorful, and generously portioned.  The decor was great too- very natural and fresh. I am planning on taking friends here soon and I am excited to share it with them!"}
{"text":"Spice is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland.  The atmosphere (sit on the patio if you can), the food, the drinks - all 5 stars.  The fact that it's farm-to-table and they grow their own produce locally makes me love this place even more.  I would highly recommend this place for a date night.  My boyfriend and I started with the Blueberries and Spice Acres Greens salad and a cheese board that came with a variety of meats, crostinis, sprouts, pimento spread and an amazing jam. We were blown away by how well all of the ingredients went together and how fresh everything tasted.  We were pretty full after our spread of appetizers so we finished by splitting the short rib, which was also incredible.  Everything was presented very well and the service was friendly and knowledgeable.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Used to go & enjoy the specialty drinks, service & good food. Went for the first time in a while & things have really gone down hill. Don't know what changed with them but it wasn't for the better"}
{"text":"Service was slow, omelet was overcooked prices were too high. Portions weren'ttoo big except for the potatoes which were awesome. coffee was good too. Somewhat of a disappointment for a Father's day brunch visiting from outside Cleveland"}
{"text":"The best french fries I've had in decades! I like my french fries to have a crispy outer shell, with a little bit of potato inside that is soft and steamy. I like them on the edge of just-about burnt, and slightly greasy. Potato \"wedges\" are the bane of my potato-loving existence. These fries were incredible, and the perfect pair to the juicy burger.   I don't usually order a burger and fries, not because I don't like them, but because I really like really good burgers and fries and I have been let down in the past. But this place was great! Once we ordered the assorted pickles, and they were super delicious, I had a feeling the burger and fries would be equally satisfying. And it was!   Parking in this area can be a bit hit-and-miss, but 1000% worth it for those epic, incredible, french fries!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Always consistent, always relaxing, and always excellent! Recently had the cold beet soup as a starter...the best ever! Had a hard time deciding between the red snapper special or the vege plate, so I asked our server to surprise me and I cleaned my plate clean... I was pleased with the vege plate! The mushroom bread pudding was divine!!"}
{"text":"The food is a 3.5 out of 5. The bugs are unnerving. The stuffed avocado is delish. A sirloin should never, ever be $22 especially when it comes with arugula and a pita. No matter how well it's cooked. Our waitress, Nadia seemed either drugged or drunk. She was not attentive at all. Every single person (who worked here) walked by us repeatedly yet never asked how our meal was or if we needed anything. I'd come back for the chickpea fries and avocado but probably not for much else."}
{"text":"On the plus side, gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan items are clearly identified on the menu. Downside, only vegan option is appetizer plate of pickles. Seriously. When I asked I was told that two of the salads can be made vegan. Honestly didn't stay to try the pickles as I was hungry for dinner. I think menu may be seasonal so there is hope for the future perhaps."}
{"text":"I had the burger, it was one of the worst burgers I have ever eaten. Not just the flavors but the bread was burnt. The dessert I had was also meh. I will say that the service was great, I was with a large group and the waitress accommodated us very well, even with our separate checks. For the prices I don't think it was worth it personally."}
{"text":"I first peeked in through the window of Spice while walking out of Happy Dog and immediately put it on my bucket list. But this view really doesn't do the interior justice: you don't get the warm glow of natural light melting with the bulbs, the open but still cozy rooms, the fresh blooms on the tables. It's surprisingly spacious inside and tucked away in the back is a patio - one of two places at which you can take advantage of Happy Hour deals (4-7pm), the other being the bar.   We made reservations for three on a Thursday night but I think we would have been fine without them. Here you can yourself without being crushed by the crowds of W 25th or E 4th, or worry about accidentally bumping shoulders with your coworker trying to squeeze through tables. You can even park in the back parking lot - for FREE! The staff was professional and a tad too eager to check in on us and offer more menu items, but helpful as we navigated the menu. Probably not the best to bring the kids though, as I could easily see judgment creeping into their eyes while watching a rambunctious child.  Knowing we were heading to Sweet Moses down the street later, and also wincing a little at the pricing, we split several appetizers. The Polenta Chickpea Fries were hearty and tasty, with or without the not so spicy remoulade sauce. We had to take videos of the breaking of the poached eggs on our Daily Flatbread, which similarly satisfied. Their bacon has a bit of sweet smokiness that's not to be missed if you eat meat! But the group favorite was the Roasted Corn Agnolotti: thick, buttery agnolotti pockets stuffed with an airy corn and cheese mash and baked, atop a fresh salad sprinkled with crispy bits of baked cheese that even I, a self-proclaimed cheese-disliker, enjoyed. I had to exercise extreme control to not eat all two agnolotti myself...   Enough with the food Helen! Tell me about the DRINKS. Well. Unfortunately I can only tell you that the cocktail list very much piqued my interest, but that I had to settle for a beer from their extensive list. Spice was offering a Rosé flight the week we went there, and I'm sure more delectable deals are on the way."}
{"text":"I find myself waking up in the middle of the night craving the polenta chic pea fries or the mushroom beignets or BOTH at the same time. Soups are constantly rotating and superb. Fresh Fresh Fresh. Oh and the seared chicken breast is like no other chicken on the planet. Think Tea Hill poultry prepared by outstanding culinary pros. The airline cut has a teany weeny bone in it giving the crispy skin and buttery moist white flesh an extra punch of flavor. I miss Spice. Can't wait to return upon my visit to C L E  Pros= locally sourced. Spice grows most of their veggies featured on the menu"}
{"text":"I love Spice. The service is always wonderful and the menu is fantastic. The use of sustainable products on their menu is a great feature. The outside patio has a wonderful ambience. We have taken our children too and they loved it. A neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"This one is in Gordon square district. It is trendy and spacious. Good drink menu between $10-12 for cocktails. Extensive wine list. Service was efficient. The soup of the day was very tasty. Polenta and cheese fries were yummy. Salad was very fresh. The butter squash vegetarian dish was very flavorful. The chicken confit was salty and one need to acquire a taste to like it. Overall a good fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Yum- O! Spice Kitchen has made its way to the top of my list of favorite Cleveland eats. It has a shabby chic and somewhat modern feel which reminded me of a restaurant I would stumble upon in Manhattan. The only complaint I have is that it got SUPER loud in there, I don't know if it is the  acoustics of the building, or what...  The food was superb. We started with the polenta fries and they were a hit with everyone. The sauce that is served with them is delicious, even though they don't even need it. For my entree, I decided to go with the perch dish and I am SO glad I did. It was such a refreshing and different choice than I am used to. It was cooked and spiced to perfection and the corn complimented it so well. I cannot wait to try different items from their menu as it changes."}
{"text":"I've been here for Dungus Day, appetizers and couple months ago stopped in for a burger.    Burger was the best I've ever had. Ordered med rare and came out perfect. They grind the meat in house! Bun and fries were done right too."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, it smelled like something wonderful was cooking in grandma's kitchen. The decor, at first glance, is shabby-chic. Nice, but after a while is cliche as that trend has been exhausted entirely too much.   The hostess was passive, at best, ignoring us completely after  I said 'hello' and was then, literally, pushed aside so a couple behind me could be seated first, with no reservation on a Friday night! The couple was nice enough to notice what had happened and requested my dining partner and I be seated first. The hostess regarded us as if we were a major inconvenience for her, seating us in a dark corner by the kitchen. Gee, thanks.   For being all about sustainable, organic food I was AMAZED there was NOTHING on this menu for vegans or even strict vegetarians. Being a vegan, I expect this from some places, but did not expect it here. I was extremely disappointed. My dining partner, a definite omnivore, also found nothing he felt like eating.  Our server spoke to us as if we were small children, unable to read the menu. For what felt like a decade, she took us through a few dishes; none of which sounded appealing, then WALKED AWAY MID-SENTENCE to service a neighboring table and did not return to the floor for another 15 minutes. When she did return, we ordered a glass of wine and a simple mixed drink. My wine glass came dirty and with a few pieces of cork, not to mention the wine had turned. Rather than pushing on with our meal, we asked for the bill. After a practical interrogation as to why we weren't staying, our server handed over our bill.  Upon our leaving, the hostess met my smile with a SCATHING look. No words.   We ended up going to Luxe, a wonderful restaurant which we frequent often. It's everything Spice should be, but most regrettably, is not."}
{"text":"Had heard rave reviews...here is mine: Good: nice space, friendly hostess/bartender. Cocktail with rum, cinnamon, nutmeg was very good. Arugula salad was fresh and had  great dressing (although I had asked for it on the side). Strip steak had great flavor. Not so good: steak and other entree (which was just a crepe appetizer) took way too long to come out, especially with only 4 other people in the restaurant). Consequently, both meals were just barely warm. We did not send them back, but, did let the waitress know. She said \" I will let the kitchen know\". But, it pretty obvious that she just took way too long to pick it up and deliver. May try again, may not."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but it took over an hour for entrees to arrive. They were super apologetic and bought us dessert which was appreciated. I know us 'Mericans are used to way oversized portions, but Spice's were ridiculously small. I'm fine with smaller portions when it's quality food but come on! We got mushroom beiniets as a app luckily and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner on a Friday evening and caught the end of Happy Hour which included some of their great starters. My friend & I shared the hot, puffy, crunchy mushroom beignets. Then we each got a cup of the cold beet soup - which is stunningly beautiful as well as delicious.  For dinner my friend got the Buckwheat noodles with winter vegetables and raved about the perfect bom choy and ate every drop of the broth. I added chicken to the Preserved Squash Risotto. It was creamy and well balanced, but definitely needed the boost of protein to make it an entree. I'm not sure what \"preserved\" meant, since there were only a few pieces that were identifiable as butternut squash, but there was no significant flavor component I would say made it stand out.  While the brown paper table cover seems homespun at first, once the water and iced tea glasses start to sweat, the paper begins to hold too much water and becomes very unattractive and impractical.   The service was attentive and the reason I am not giving 4 stars is the limited menu.  I understand concentrating on doing a few things well, but with the a la carte nature of the menu as it stands, it can become very expensive to assemble a full meal. With Salads at $8 and entrees with protein at $22 or more, It's just something to be aware of. There was also no fish offering on a Friday during Lent, just a PEI Mussel dish that seemed to be more of a starter.  A lot of folks ordered the Andouille Burger which looked good going by - and might be something I'll try in the future.   I would definitely come back - making sure to hit the Happy Hour to get great starter prices and to try their Spring Menu - since they're finishing up the Winter Menu right now."}
{"text":"This is one of Cleveland's best restaurants but it is a bit of a hidden gem in that it's a bit out of the way and there aren't a lot of parking options around here so it is easy to pass up.  The food is always new and excellent. The interior is modern, bright and new. The cocktails are above average for a restaurant although they are not the focus.  Do your best to sample at least something from each course. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"wow this place is amazing! one of my favorite places in cleveland already.  firstly, love the design and decor. very clean and simple. we went for brunch. one of the only places in the city that has brunch on Saturday as well as Sunday.  Oh the drinks were yummy. I had something orangey and bubbly.  the food was delicious. I had a mushroom asparagus migas. the table shared the lemon sour cream beignets. although they tasted more like really delicious doughnut holes. like the best doughnut holes ever. my friend had the Korean BBQ chicken and waffle. i can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in CLE. Love the mushroom beignets and stuffed avocado which is not always on the menu but should be. Chickpea fries are great too."}
{"text":"Wow farm to table in Cleveland. Well done! Farm to table can sometimes be a pretentious hippy loving filled experience but this one was definitely tasty and enjoyable.  Looking at the menu I definitely did see some Korean inspired items, like the pork belly items.  We had the table side tea where they. They bring you a basket of loose leaf teas and steep it for you in a small teapot.  We shared a plate of beneigts which had a goat cheese flavored dipping sauce which was an amazing mix of flavors!  I then had Benedict with pork belly which was delicious.  And the hash/potatoes were a great accompaniment.  The space was airy and   plenty of seating.  It was nice to soak up the sun near the windows and enjoy a nice meal.  All the servers were super nice and polite and very attentive.  Would definitely come back for brunch or even check out their dinner menu.  I definitely want to try the bread of the day as well."}
{"text":"What a jewel of deliciousness. Farm to market sourced ingredients and clever and innovative use of current harvest ingredients. The mushroom beignets are other worldly... The cold cucumber soup with Feta & herbed olive oil did disappoint. Eclectic selection of interesting wines that don't break the bank make this little spot the lapis lazuli  of Lakewood."}
{"text":"Spice has been on our list for several years now, we just hadn't pulled the trigger. Why? Some laziness, but mostly because it's a pretty pricey establishment and if we're gonna drop well over $100 on dinner a special occasion would be a necessity. We decided that our 15th wedding anniversary was just the thing to get us over the activation energy need for this reaction to occur.  We had reservations at 6pm and when we arrived the place was already bustling. The front bar was playing host to the typical dressed-up after workers happily exchanging horror stories and office gossip after another long week. We were ushered to the main dining area and seated at one of the tables toward the front windows.   The decor is rustic and classy. Exposed brick and ductwork, hardwood floors, reclaimed French doors separating the two dining areas, muted colors - it was both comfortable and upscale at the same time. It's clear that a great deal of effort went into designing the interior but it didn't feel at all contrived.  The service was, how to put it gracefully, professional yet cold. This is one of the main reasons that Spice missed receiving my top mark. Our waters were constantly refilled and plates were cleared in a timely fashion, but our server was quite aloof. I don't recall a single smile or bit of conviviality coming our way. She did her job well enough, but nothing more.  On the adult beverage front, the selection doesn't disappoint. The draught beer selection is small but effective with several local selections from Platform Beer Co. and Fat Head's Brewery and the bottles list offered up several rare treats of which I was quick to take advantage. Brouwerij Liefmans Goudenband? Yes please. I was also surprised by how reasonably-priced the beers were. As for cocktails, it's a different story. If you're going the craft cocktail route, it's best to get your gold card ready. These creations start at $11 and go up to $14. A glass of wine will set you back about $10.   Minor Annoyance - Places really need to ditch the whole mason jars as drinking vessels thing. They just don't work. The threads on the lip get in the way and don't feel right. Stick with drinking glasses meant for drinking.  We started our meal with the bread service ($4) and the mushroom beignets ($7). The bread was fresh, soft and delicious, ciabatta-style and topped with thin slices of sun-dried tomatoes and flakes of sea salt. The crispy, fried to perfect golden beignets were addictively poppable and the goat cheese creme fraische made the perfect dip.  My wife and I shared the soup of the day ($6) which, if memory serves, was a smoked corn bisque. I may not remember the exact type of soup but I do recall the intensity of flavor, the buttery smoothness of the puree and the perfect seasoning. Whatever it was, I'd get it again.  For mains I went with the honey glazed hangar steak ($32) and my wife the breaded and fried walleye ($24). My wife was pleased with her dish, the fish well-prepared, crispy breading, tender & flaky meat paired with a thin-sliced quick-pickled cuke and a side of house-made tartar. I was less in love with mine. There were several missteps in execution on my dish that, weren't it for the $30+ pricetag, I may have overlooked. The meat itself was overcooked and quite tough with the improper slicing of this particular cut aiding and abetting the crime. The fingerling potatoes were also inconsistently cooked with several verging on crunchy. I did enjoy the level of heat provided by the fresh-tasting salsa verde and sliced shishito peppers.  For dessert, it was to be the \"Home Slice\", the Soup du Jour pie style. It just so happened to be a bourbon pecan pie a la mode at the time of our visit. An easy decision for two such pecan pie fanatics. Their rendition was spot on. Not overly sweet with the bourbon adding a nice grown-up feel to the classic. The vanilla ice cream was velvety smooth and exactly the right supporting actor for this cast. A wonderful end to a somewhat spotty performance.  Spice is a very nice restaurant with a great deal going for it. The space is beautiful, the use of fresh, locally-sourced ingredients is evident as is the attention to detail in (most of) the dishes we sampled during our visit. Unfortunately, standards shift when it comes to eateries that play on the far end of the price spectrum, and I simply couldn't let several glaring missteps pass by without taking them to task. Yes, I hold restaurants like Spice to a higher standard. It's their lot. What are the chances for a return visit? Right now, I'm still undecided."}
{"text":"The wife and I went to Spice last night and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal.  The decor was very tasteful with nice touches in the details.  The art-deco bar was still in place and filled with a lively crowd.  We sat in the middle dining room next to a large window that looked out onto Detroit Avenue.  Very pleasant.    The wife ordered a drink with gin and st. Germain, which was well made.  I had a Troeg's Mad Elf on draft.  The Mad Elf was a steal at $6 for a pint.  We started the meal with squash soup and the mushroom beignets.  Both were perfectly prepared and presented.  The soup was incredibly rich but was provided a nice balance by the accompanying chili oil.  The beignets were by far my favorite.  Deep fried, yet light, and filled with a rich mushroom flavor.  Absolutely fantastic.    The entrees were also great.  We got the special cauliflower ravioli in brown butter and the buckwheat noodles with mushrooms.  The ravioli were also very rich, but not in a cloying way.  The flavor was outstanding.  The filling was velvety, and the pasta nicely browned.  The noodle entree was also very good.  The noodles were properly chewy, and the mushrooms were earthy and fragrant.  Nice broth also.  Service was very prompt and knowledgeable.   All in all, the meal was perfect for a winter night in Cleveland.  As I understand, the menu will change from season to season, so I hope I can look forward to enjoying this new addition to my neighborhood year round. (Hopefully the new management plans on retaining the excellent patio)"}
{"text":"Spice Kitchen + Bar is a wonderfully trendy restaurant along the Detroit shoreway in the same stretch as many awesome establishments such as Sweet Moses, the Superelectric Pinball Parlor and Happy Dog. I've been eyeing this place for a bit, so I was excited to finally give this is a shot. This review is for brunch.  The ambiance was excellent, especially at the time, there were fresh flowers everywhere. The service was friendly and prompt. Everything looked good on the menu. This seems to be a well-loved establishment, so why three stars? If you're reading this, better find a chair and sit down...  Let's start with the Korean Fried chicken and Waffles. I loved the flavor, but the fried chicken was dry and rubbery, like a government-issued chicken fingers school lunch. At this level, I'd except juiciness and melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, but it wasn't the case. The waffle was also overcooked and crumbly like a cookie, instead of soft and pillowy. You're better off with Chick-Fil-A strips and waffle fries instead of this dish. I did love the creative twist on the popovers presented as pancakes, that one was good. Maybe I should've ordered the pork belly, that one is hard to mess up.  Due to the sheer reputation of the place, I'll give this another shot and update my review. Maybe it was an off-day. Maybe they do dinner better. Maybe this is better as a bar. I don't yet know. All-in-all, for now, 3 stars."}
{"text":"The gumbo is amazing!  Spicy food for sure!  Large selection of $3 happy hour drinks.  Trendy place.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times. Every time I go the menu is new and fresh--It is a great place to go in the winter for that reasonjust . Most recently, we had reserved a large table for a family brunch--they customized a menu for my party. Everyone was impressed. Dad gummit, even the cocktails are made from scratch."}
{"text":"The chickpea fries were an amazing inventive dish and must not be missed when ordering, otherwise the menu wasn't terribly exciting."}
{"text":"After working for 12 hours setting up the Republican convention I needed a really good yet healthy meal. I went by myself sat at the bar about 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. The hostess let me know the time while she told me the specials. I ordered a chilled cucumber soup special  and the red fish special.  The bartender Marta totally hooked up the perfect Chablis to compliment both dishes. She also offered great suggestions for the first time tourist to Cleveland. I can't even begin to describe how amazing both courses were!!!! To say they were delicious is an understatement!! The chef/owner Ben happened to be at the bar right after I  initially ordered so I was lucky enough to apologize for arriving so late and thank him for feeding me after a long work day. I am here for two weeks and plan on visiting a few more times it was that good!! Thank you all for the perfect meal and a chill vibe!!"}
{"text":"Just say yes and GO!!!  You will enjoy the vibe, the minute that you walk in.  The bar is fun, along with knowledgeable barkeepers with a fun attitude.  Great drinks!  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The BIG win is the food.  Unique flavors, an ever changing menu as their ingredients are locally raised.  Simply a delight!  We have been there 3 times in the last 8 months."}
{"text":"Horrible! Go here if you want to pay almost $200 for a meal worth \"maybe\" $40. We got the Valentine's Day special 4 course meal dinner for 2. The waitress clearly explained to us at the beginning that the $65 total price included 4 courses for 2. The entree was smaller than if you got it off the regular menu, the desert was over the top and tiny. Now it gets interesting.. We got our check and it was double of what we were told the special cost, completely senseless. Had to talk to the manager about the poorly communicated prices. All in all - I wouldn't go here again or recommend it to anyone. Try crop kitchen or south side diner instead."}
{"text":"Interesting reading the reviews on this place.  Most are very complimentary, and a couple are downright scathing.  My wife and I came here a few weeks ago on a recommendation of a very good foodie friend of hers who said this was her favorite place.  She wasn't wrong.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Food was outstanding, especially the gnocchi.   I am big fans of Parallax and L'Albatross, and I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"I'll save this update for dranks--because it's worth an update for that very reason.   I frequent XYZ Tavern down the street at least once a week. Well, sometimes when I leave XYZ, I'm not ready to go home and an additional cocktail sounds amazing. Enter, Spice.   I love that the bar is right up front. I'm typically able to hop on a bar seat quickly and order. All their house cocktails are phenomenal. And when I say \"phenomenal,\" I'm not just some annoying chick claiming everything with that word. Nope. These dranks are effing glorious. And sometimes, I just order a dirty martini, which they also do up like a boss.   Next time you're in the area and are looking for a delicious cocktail, head over to Spice. And also, just try to sit at the bar (even with a tummy full of food) and NOT order the mushroom beignets..."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and good service. I just didn't think the food was that great and a bit expensive for what we got. I remember I got a butternut squash salad. The squash was a bit cold and therefore felt undercooked. I can't even remember what else I got.  Not many options for vegetarians.  Dessert menu was so so, we ended up walking down the street to Sweet Moses instead.  I ended up reminiscing back when this spot was Snickers and had delicious mac n cheese."}
{"text":"OK, it may have just been that everything happened exactly as planned. A total fluke. At any rate - the evening was lovely. Here's why:  The boy and I went for Friday Date Night, and curbside parking was available lickity-split. We didn't have reservations, it was happy-hour and they sat us on their patio. The temperature was perfect and there wasn't a need for sunglasses because it was shaded nicely.  Everything else is happenstance. I happen to like Santigold. I happen to enjoy Polenta, Mushrooms, and eggs on my pizza. I lived in Louisiana for far too long - so I happen to enjoy beignets. My weakness happens to be french fries and I also happen to like dry Rose's.   So, you gotta believe me when I say that it just so happened, that the Pandora station played Santigold and similar artists - and they had this awesome Rose' that was dry like a Sauvignon Blanc. And the tapas plates that really excited me where these mushroom beignets, that tasted more like a homemade cream of mushroom soup inside of a lightly breaded mushroom! The chickpea polenta fries were structurally really neat - very dense, seasoned and battered well, and served with an awesome little remoulade sauce. The flatbread itself had an interesting texture - it was a thin crust but not so crunchy that you'd fear losing a tooth; A great crispy texture that offset the runny poached eggs on top. Local cheese curds and bacon finished it off. It was delightful!   Service was wonderful. Everyone that spoke to us was sincere and welcoming. The waitress was really knowledgeable about the menu items. She sincerely enjoyed interacting.   Can I go there again tomorrow!?"}
{"text":"Spice cooks tasty farm-to-table food at special events too. We wanted food cooked on site at The Ballroom at Park Lane, not hot-boxed.  Spice has great choices, and everything was delicious, right down to the cake.  We had a few ingredient restrictions that they were able to meet.  Janna is professional and compassionate.  Got to the restaurant to get an idea of what they could add to your special event."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure. I couldn't believe this place wasn't more crowded on a beautiful Saturday evening. We got a seat out in the back patio and enjoyed some happy hour treats. Walking out into the patio felt like stumbling into a secret garden. Rows of planters and fresh herbs filled the pergola planter. We sat at the small bar and ordered cocktails which were both delicious (forgetting the names now but one was garnished with fresh thai basil and the other with lavender). We tried the Lake Erie Creamery Pearls (more \"goat-y\" than I usually like my cheese), the happy hour burger with an egg on top, and the flat beans.  The food was amazingly delicious and beautifully plated. We will have to come back to try the chef's tasting menu.  Happy hour is Tue-Sun from 4-7 with very reasonable prices for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date night. The food was wonderful and very thoughtfully made. We had several starters, but the standout was the cheese board which we added a variety of meats to."}
{"text":"Wow. Had no expectations going in as we found it in the Cleveland Independents deck of $10-off cards. Ended up having happy hour; wines for $5, other drink specials, and select starters from the menu a few bucks off. Love that they print on their menu something along the lines of \"These items come from our farm this week.\" All ingredients seem fresh and of good quality. Our favorite was the Lake Erie Creamery Pearls - beautiful presentation of goat cheese balls in a small jar of olive oil along with crostinis, apple slices, dried fruits, and candied pecans - yum! We also tried the flatbread, mushroom beignets with honey goat cheese creme fresh (different and very tasty!) and the pappardelle. All were great. Service by the bartender Tony was attentive and informative but not intrusive. Looking forward to visiting again for a rose-tasting or a Sunday night chef's whim dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend during restaurant week.  Located on Detroit near Gordon Square, Spice Kitchen is a great location with really good food.  Spice takes the farm to table ethos seriously and adds culinary skill and presentation flair.    Spice is two rooms with a sexy atmosphere, white walls with photos and natural accents are set off with subdued lighting.  The Art Deco Bar is well worth noting.  Service is relaxed, but friendly.  The menu varies with the seasons and what is available and best; Spice has a farm in the Cuyahoga Valley as well as a garden behind the restaurant.  Since it was restaurant week, we both ordered off of the list.    I had the mushroom beignets which were small crispy dumplings sided with a honey goat cheese dipping sauce.  The beignets were good, but I was expecting more of a mushroom flavor, it was there, but very subtle.  The dipping sauce was good, slightly sweet with a hint of goat cheese tang.  My friend had the goat cheese salad which she thoroughly enjoyed.    For the entree I had the roasted walleye; two beautiful fillets of perfectly cooked whitefish, served with roasted rainbow radishes, apple slices and a vibrant green hummus sauce.  The dish was a treat for the eyes, perfectly presented, with great simple flavors.  The flaky walleye was moist and flavorful, the radishes and apples provided slight sweetness and a nice crispness.  The sauce was subdued, but brought the dish together.  My friend had the hoison glazed brisket, which she absolutely loved.  For desert we both choose the chocolate pot de creme, which was a delicious velvety chocolate custard, my biggest issue was that there wasn't a bigger portion.  A wonderful chocolate ending to a great meal.  Spice Kitchen is well worth a visit, especially if you are looking for a relaxed romantic dinner; the food is excellent and the presentations are a treat for the eyes.  Flavors are simple and direct, a bit subtle for my taste, but exceedingly well done."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious! They introduced me to rabbit for the first time and I couldn't believe how tasty it was. Really nice food combinations!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Honestly, their food is incredible, and their service is top notch. Do yourself a favor and get the mushroom beignets. You will not be disappointed! Their cocktails are also really nice. I have been to Spice probably 5 times in the last year and have but once left disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow everything that hit our table was amazing and the service was amazing too! We got a salad and some absolutely incredible ravioli.   Plus eating food that was grown in the CLE is so nice! Yay eating local!   The single downside was the foam that came with the ravioli fell flat quickly as it was quite dense, but overall a stellar experience! I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"David, the bar manager, is adorable!  It just needs to be said.    Not only is he engaging, he really knows his stuff when it comes to making the perfect drink.  From kombucha to limoncello and dirty martinis, David's knowledge is impressive!  He delivers said information with a smile and undeniable charm.    I am also impressed by this and other Cleveland restaurants that serve thoughtful, fresh, local food, and seasonal menus.  I hope the trend becomes a lifestyle across America.  The presentation, flavor, and experience of this kind of cuisine brings undeniable joy.  This was the second stop on our food crawl for a friend's 31st birthday, and it was top notch.  The three of us shared plates of beet salad with roasted hazelnuts, seared raviolis on a bed of pureed spinach, and mushroom beignets with honey goat cheese crème fraiche.    Charismatic bartender, clever cocktails, quality bites.    Undeniably, we didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for dinner or just hanging out.  The food is excellent. Small plates but big flavor"}
{"text":"Love this farm to table neighborhood gem.  The back of the menu shows were the food is sourced, which is really fun.  The menu is eclectic and delicious, the ambiance of the restaurant is like a Chicago city place.  Outstanding food and service.  Love the decor and everything about it.  Sorry I missed the patio this year, but will try when it is warmer again."}
{"text":"I went with a wife and a friend last night.  It was a decent experience.  Service: 5.0 - Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Everything I expect.  Ambiance: 3.0 - It was a little cold.  Otherwise, the decor was average and the lights were very dim.  There's nothing I did or didn't like.  It was just average--it looked like any other modern west-side restaurant.  The place is very clean.  They have a huge place, but they seem to like seating people in the bar area.  I would recommend they try to put more people into the dining area.  I felt a little too much like I was at a bar.  Menu: 3.5 - The menu is small and focused, which is fine and expected given the focus on seasonal ingredients. But, it could use a few more meat options given the size of the menu.  The food all looks good, but there wasn't anything on the menu that blew me away at all.  Food: 3 - I started with the garbanzo bean fries.  It's felafel in stick form served with a chili mayo they make in-house.  The mayo was great and the felafel did and ok job at mimicking a french fry (crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside).    I had the pappardelle special, which included house-made pasta, a cream sauce, parmesan, mushrooms, and asparagus.  The sauce and the veggies were very good, but nothing to write home about.  The pasta had a good texture, and it was the widest pappardelle I've seen (I liked that), but many of my pasta strands were stuck together.  While the texture of the pasta felt like fresh made pasta, the flavor just wasn't there.  I don't know if the pasta was lost in the sauce or if it needs more eggs or what, but my Italian heart was longing for the missing flavor of the pasta.  What really surprised me was the portion size.  This was a half-size portion at most other restaurants.  I don't expect to get a massive bowl of pasta, but at the same time, I want to get my money's worth.  I don't recall the exact price, but $14 comes to mind.  I think it was really worth about $9.  My friend got the same dish, but he added chicken.  They used skin-on airline chicken (de-boned breast but with the leg bone intact).  The chicken appeared to be prepped with skill, the skin was perfectly rendered and crispy, and it was well seasoned and moist.  Anyone can cook chicken, but the chef showed a bit of skill on this one.  It really made me think of how they need more meat on their menu because I bet the chef has the chops for some great meat-based dishes.  I have no clue how much he paid for the added chicken, but I know it was too much.  The price of the dish should have included the chicken, IMO.  My wife had the andouille burger.  It was good, but just like the other food, nothing to rave about.  Good flavor, good texture, and the side of chips had a hint of chili seasoning.  I don't think it was worth $13.  We skipped desert since we were full.  Overall, we were satisfied, but the price point was just too high for what we got.  I get that the freshest ingredients and from-scratch food costs more, but the dishes just didn't rise up the level that would justify the cost.  I wasn't upset with  my meal or experience at all, I wouldn't tell someone to avoid this place, and I'll be back when the menu changes next.  However, I think the food needs a bit more creativity to get out of the 3-star bracket in yelp ratings."}
{"text":"I went for brunch this weekend and it was fantastic!  As other reviewers have said, everything is fresh and local down to the grains that go into their homemade bread.   I had the dixie Benedict - a variation on a Benedict that had pork belly and a biscuit.  It came with some delicious potatoes.   Their juice of the day was a fresh pressed watermelon-lemon-ginger and it was super yummy too!   Everyone in my group loved their meals and the service was spot-on.  I can't wait to go back and try dinner here soon!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good meal before a film at Capitol Theater and wanted something other than Luxe (nothing against it though). Spice was exactly what we were looking for. No wait. Cool vibe. Great service. Amazing food! I had the chicken and I swear EVERY bite was as good as the first....so tasty! Go there soon."}
{"text":"Visited Friday evening with my boyfriend and had a wonderful meal: great food, great service, and great environment.   I ordered the mushroom and ricotta ravioli and it was slightly undercooked but still tasted amazing. Our server was very enthusiastic and knowledgable about the menu and the restaurant. She recommended a great wine pairing with my ravioli and I was very pleased overall with the evening."}
{"text":"What a great gem on the Detroit Shore-way!  This is  an actual, genuine farm to table restaurant!  We loved everything that we tried!  The menu changes all of the time to keep up with what they have fresh at their farm.  Our service was spot on and we had a fabulous time."}
{"text":"I will admit, I don't always understand all the ingredients in the dish I choose.  But, I have faith in this place that no matter what i order, it'll come out Devine!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed at spice. The menu changes with the local produce the food is excellent. We had eggplant ravioli that melted in your mouth with flavor. Nothing is standard the flavor combinations are unique. I just wish I could go once a month!"}
{"text":"First time to a Farm to Fork restaurant and I was impressed with selection of apps and entrees , everything was good! Worth the try."}
{"text":"Total let down for brunch. SLOOOOOW YO NO service. Hostess apathetic. Food was fine when it finally came an hour after ordering. Service terrible. Attitude is pretentious. No coffee or Water refills. $175 for 6 adults and 2 kids. Hipster homesteader, cooler than thou vibe sucks."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Cleveland. Dave runs a tight ship and is proud of the food they serve and the staff they employ. The menu has changed with the seasons, but my current favorite is the grilled avocado with couscous."}
{"text":"Brunch here is wonderful. Tried a newer addition to the menu - the Fried egg + Chorizo Tostada - and it was excellent. It was a layered meal, so every bite was delightful especially the blank beans in the meal. The ambiance is also worth nothing, it was filled with light, touches of fall and overall uplifting. Service was a little slow, not terrible, but still could have been more speedy. I asked for hot sauce when my meal arrived and was half way through my meal by the time the hot sauce arrived. All in all, a definite Cleveland brunch must."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for breakfast with my daughter and had a nice meal. She got a mimosa to start with and the breakfast crepes while I had  a pork belly benedict. We had some blueberry beignets to start our meal that were hot and delicious!   Our waitress, Mandy, was very nice and helpful! Love \"The Giving Tree\" tattoo!    Our meal took a bit longer than it probably should have - a table next to ours that was seated later had their food out 10 minutes before ours which was strange.  My breakfast was terrific- loved the hollandaise with the creamy yolk of the egg and salty pork belly with the crunch of the English muffin. I would get that dish again!   My daughter's crepes were ok, but after trying my benedict she said she'd opt for that if we stop in again!    All in all, this was a great breakfast with a super staff...we'll make it back again!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously spectacular! The food, the atmosphere and the staff are all just wonderful! I'll be returning, and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a food show and had this place recommended to me from some of my fellow Cincy chefs. I'm very glad we went! The decor is super simple and warm. The moment I walked in the door, the bartender greeted me with a big smile and a hearty hello. The server was also the host and quickly seated us in a nice quiet area. She was obviously really busy being the only server on but she still took the time to make us feel welcome. She immediately took our drink orders and gave us suggestions and the specials. The back waiter was also really friendly and made sure our waters were always full!   We ordered a ton of small plates. The pickle board, the walleye brandade, ramp and cheese beignets. All of them came out quickly which i loved! I loved the beignets. They were crispy, light and airy, and just packed with flavor. The walleye was good, but the chips were overly salted as was the brandade, and I do believe salt is love. Heck I have it tattooed on me! But it was still good. The pickles were nice, all very distinct in flavors. My personal favorites were the pickled and grilled shallots and the carrots.   I decided to go for the special for my entree. I love getting specials because i have found it really says a lot about the kitchen. The duck to my surprise was cooked medium well. I am accustomed to med rare being the chef temp. Though I prefer mine med rare, I enjoyed the dish. The skin was crispy and seasoned beautifully!   For desert I decided to go with the house slice. This was explained to me as a lemon poppy seed cake with buttercream. It was very disappointing. The presentation was just a slice of layered cake on it's side on a long plank of wood. It was so dry I felt like I was eating a cracker. The buttercream literally tasted like salty butter. It was like eating a saltine with salted butter. To make matters worse, when I told the server I did a like it, she said \"was it dry?\" And then proceeded to tell me I wasn't the first person to say that. This brings up the bigger question \"If you know it is dry (meaning the pastry chef not the server), and complaints have been made, WHY WOULD YOU KEEP SERVING IT!?!?\" The server made no issue of removing the item from the table and the bill.   Other than that, the food was enjoyable as was the service and the ambiance. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a food snob, but I was a little underwhelmed by Spice Kitchen +Bar. I dropped by with my boyfriend for an early dinner on a Saturday night (after making a reservation - thank goodness!).  We started off our meal with the mushroom beignets. I love mushroom everything, but these little puppies were just ok IMHO.  For my meal, I got the vegan entree on the menu - a roasted mushroom accompanied by roasted winter vegetables with rice and a parsnip puree. It was a really flavorful dish. But...on the lighter side. Yes, a mushroom can be meaty...but my meal left me wanting something more.   I did have a couple excellent drinks. The pressed to impress was appley and delicious. My boyfriend had a drink special made with fresh peach puree and that tasted more like a boozy smoothie, but he liked it. His ribeye was just ok in his opinion. But he can be a steak snob.  I hope to go back and try other menu items since Spice uses fresh, local ingredients. I'd especially like to go back in the summer and have grub fresh from their garden!"}
{"text":"Ben Bebenroth is one of our favorite chefs.  The dinner was delicious.  The pickled ramps are spicy and sweet, and the mushroom beignets were great as always.  I had the New York strip steak and enjoyed it greatly.  This is always a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  It was a cold, snowy winter day around Thanksgiving and Gordon Square looked completely deserted - seriously - but this place was full of people.  The ambiance was hip and upbeat and I really liked the decor around the bar area.  We had tried to make reservations earlier but it was all booked, so we had to settle for a table at the bar.  But that didn't detract from our experience at all.  Anyways, my group of friends and I wanted to order everything on the menu because it all sounded so good.  Nothing disappointed - everything we ended up trying was amazing.  We tried: - Mushroom beignets: salted and fried perfectly - great finger food. - Flatbread - Oxtail butternut squash gnocchi: I don't think I've ever had gnocchi this good.  Dunking the gnocchi into the oxtail broth is key. - Roasted salmon: I really liked the sweetness of the asian pear in this one. - Roasted chicken - Apple cobbler (special): They sold out of this right after we ordered it.  It was warm and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. - Apple upside down cake  The only downside to this restaurant is it is a bit pricey.  But it's definitely worth every cent."}
{"text":"Spice was great. The ambience was wonderful and the food was spot on. My boyfriend and I had the ribeye and the goat cheese gnudi. Both were fabulous, gorgeous playing, complex flavor profiles, and cooked to perfection. The only thing I didn't love about Spice was the service. It was incredibly slow and in general it seemed like they didn't know much about the menu or how the food was prepared. Other than that I had a great time at spice and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Can we say WOW? Ate here last night with my family.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, the service was GREAT, the food was AMAZING, desert was PERFECT.  I can go on and on...  Everyone in our group loved the food and experience. We loved it so much that we had to thank the chef personally.  Only downside is the cost but it is worth every penny.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Thimble sized over-priced drinks.  In general, over-priced.  I wouldn't put it in the top 10 let alone \"best restaurant in Cleveland\" - Jimbo"}
{"text":"Always \"the best meal I've had\" at Spice. I had the pork chop which is available at the time this is written (the menu is always changing for the season), and it was phenomenal. I was swayed by our waiters suggestion that the pork chop was particularly good over the burger as his preference. I was easily swayed by him due to the virgin drink I had asked for (surprise me!) which was amazing as well; it again was one of the best meals I've had.  Always top notch at Spice, they know what they are doing, and you can't go wrong with farmer direct to table!   A++ keep it coming!"}
{"text":"Friends in Cleveland finally got a reservation at this spot.  Apparently this can be a tough reservation.  There is a small parking lot with street parking also nearby.  Interior is nicely done.  We were seated at a table for 8 near the bar area.  Half of the party arrived early and we were seated at the table which was nice.  We ordered wine and cocktails from the full bar while we waited.  Menu has items for vegetarians and meat lovers.  Our group had steak, salmon, and chicken entrees with various veggie small plates and soups.  Atmosphere was kid friendly.  Service was good but seemed to slow a bit as the tables filled.  Surprisingly, gratuity was not automatically added for such a large party.  Cost was mod expensive with most entrees around $24 - steak was $30.  When I'm back in Clevaland I'd like to visit again."}
{"text":"Went with three other people, and we had a pretty wide variety of dishes. There's a lot to like here, starting with the local, seasonal and small menu. The prices are pretty reasonable and the menu is creative. The mushroom beignets were particularly good, as was the papardelle dish. The vegan entree, labeled \"buckwheat noodles\" indicated a mushroom broth, but I didn't expect it to be a full-fledged soup. It was nice and substantial, but not exactly what I was hoping for. That was really the only hiccup in our meal. Service was good, and the handful of beer taps were of high quality. I hope this place overcomes the curse of its location."}
{"text":"Came here with 4 people. Some prices are considerably high for what you get portion wise. The bread service was very good tasting but $7.00 for 3 pieces of bread, really.!  Had the pork shoulder confit. Again very good tasting but the cost was high for what you get.  I am not looking for a buffet, but I would like to leave a restaurant without feeling hungry. The desserts were awesome, which made us feel a little fuller. Maybe your opinion will be different, but now I know what to expect."}
{"text":"Called ahead repeatedly to make a reservation but no answer. Service was terrible, took 3 hours total on a not so busy Sunday morning. With empty tables everywhere we watched people come and go while we waited to be seated. We decided to order a drink at the bar and sit down which took 10 minutes. Once we were seated we waited 1 hour to get drinks. My group was so mad they wanted to order Happy Dog because they knew it was fast and good. Luckily our food came out hot and was great. Skip the salmon Benedict and get the country one. Our waitress spilled water all over me probably due to the happy dog comments but we only saw her 4 times during our hours there. There were tons of people running around to clean up and refill waters and coffee, maybe they just need to communicate more. Or maybe it's  just bad karma or maybe she was just having a bad day. We still tipped her 20% because the entire group has worked in the restaurant industry, but we won't be back. They didn't seem to care at all so we can take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everytime I've been, the service is friendly, attentive, and down to earth. The food is always amazing and with happy hour specials, you can taste some of their food at a reasonable price.   When I go out to eat with my father, our family orders for him and he eats. When he ate gets, he scarfed it and wanted more. This place is fabulous."}
{"text":"Really impressed by the space. Great vibe. Very quiet; perfect for a weekday birthday dinner for my mom with the family.   Attentive service, our server (Patrick?) was pleasant and funny. He gave us the specials and definitely \"read\" our table well.   Cocktails were great. I had the Peter Rabbit, my mom got Spice's take on a Dark and Stormy.   Green curry soup du jour was a slam dunk. My rhubarb salad was over dressed but a great appetizer portion. Very fresh.   My mother and I both had the Walleye. Maybe I'm spoiled by Cleveland's rich food scene but I was severely underwhelmed. The cornmeal crust was bland; saving grace was the relish on top. My little brother got the steak. His words? \"Skip it\". My dad  had the seasonal special, a chicken breast atop wild rice. He said it was decent. No \"wow\" factor.   Dessert, however, was phenomenal. We split an ice cream bar and the s'more eclair. The smokiness on that eclair was perfection and it was served in an adorable jar. Points for presentation, Spice.   Final result? I'll be back for dessert after dining down the street at Luxe."}
{"text":"cute restaurant in the old former haunt of snicker 2, la boca, etc. nothing seems to have lasted in this location, let's hope this one is the exception!  chickpea polenta fries and mushroom beignets, 2 appetizer selections, are soooo good, i could have eaten them for dinner! i can totally understand why they've gotten klnd of a cult following......loved them! had the walleye entree.....delicious, flaky fish, properly cooked, but the highlight on the plate was the super sweet, fresh corn with scallion oil and seasonal beans. i could have eaten an entire plate of the corn. so delicious, so fresh tasting. you can clearly see that it had been lovingly cut from the cob in house.  dining partner had the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with a north caroline mustard style bbq sauce.....very good, very unique. dessert was on special that night; a peach and blackberry cobbler with in house made blueberry ice cream. simply delicious. the crust was SO buttery. i could have eaten the blueberry ice cream, alone, and been content.  overall, good place to go....menu is very limited, service is friendly and attentive. drinks are unique and well prepared......i would like to see this restaurant succeed and become a staple on the cleveland restaurant scene....."}
{"text":"Dear reader, I didn't even know this neighborhood existed. As a dedicated west sider, there's not much I visit between Tremont (my well documented vice of choice) and my neighborhood haunts. Sweet Moses is where this neighborhood ended for me, until I was dragged into Spice by those claiming it to be the next big Cleveland eatery.  I'm a serious bonehead, sometimes.  Spice Kitchen is magnificent. It's an enormous space, featuring lots of well spaced and private tables in 3 separate eating areas. The bar area is also of good size, and boasts lots of carefully crafted fancy cocktails and craft beer selections.   The food here rotates regularly to feature locally sourced produce and offerings, and reflects a remarkably whimsical approach from its chef. They produce food both from the local area (local farmers, WSM) and literally, from the local area. (The neighborhood) The menu is short, but doesn't misfire on any of its offerings. My group tasted the walleye, the ribeye, and the pumpkin risotto-eye. The steak was DECADENT in its red wine reduction, featuring small bits of crispy pork and a richness which paired perfectly with the hash/fennel salad it plated with. The walleye was buttery and flaky, truly standing out in the cauliflower puree and exploding with flavor. The risotto, to all intents and purposes, was perfectly pumpkiny. (Note: I don't typically do squash/pumpkin/etc dishes, so I don't want to pretend to know how it fared to typical dishes of the sort)   Service was exceptional and the decor lent itself to more of a quiet and intimate romantic vibe. Date nighters will instantly get their juices flowing. (Which sounds disturbing, come to think of it) It's the kind of spot that lends well to visiting regularly and trying the seasonal offerings as they come."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for some time, but the prices were always off-putting enough to make it too excessive for just the average night. Finally, an occasion came and I brought my parents here.  The menu is small, but everything we had was delicious - I had the melon salad, polenta, and my folks had the walleye and the ribeye. Each received rave reviews (especially the walleye - creamed corn concocted by the hands of angels), and the cornmeal pound cake never had a CHANCE against us. Even the coffee is good. I'm prepared to save up money for the next time I can dine here.   Also, the atmosphere is SO cool, and the service is superb."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Cozy, unique atmosphere. You have to get pork dumplings for? an appetizer!! One of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"We went here for a happy hour event, and greatly enjoyed our evening! Parking was tight, but we found a spot in their lot. For the event, we had our own bartender who was making specialty cocktails that were delicious and unique. One of my favorites was Sweater Weather-honey vanilla OVO vodka, pierre ferrand curaçao, house spice orgeat with lime. The staff were so friendly, and happy to chat about Spice. The cheese board was full of different cheeses, fresh figs, sugared nuts, breads and crackers-plus the display was beautiful. I thought about sticking around for dinner, but the menu was a bit on the smaller and pricier side, while I was just looking for a quick bite. However, i am looking forward to going back for date night to enjoy dinner!"}
{"text":"Overall very average.  Came for dinner and for the cost wasn't worth it. Dumplings were delicious. Salmon was good.   Polenta fries, pork chop and oatmeal cake dessert were all okay. Drinks were also average, pretty unimpressive actually.  Ambiance is cute but we were seated very closely to other tables which seemed very unnecessary for how not busy it was.   Would come back for happy hour bc it seems like a good deal and the food isn't bad, but wouldn't recommend regular dinner."}
{"text":"Spice Kitchen is a find. It's a find for anywhere, not just Cleveland, but for a restaurant in this area to focus upon local, sustainable farming practices, having its own farm, having relationships with local farmers, and having a seasonal menu is exceptional. The back of the menu features a map of their farm, exemplifying the farm-to-table experience with produce (I didn't sense quite the same with the meat, which is not to say that it isn't, but I don't recall the producers from where the animals were sourced referenced on the menu). What's more, the food is delicious. While a commitment to organic produce and practice has not yet rooted itself into the consciousness of even these purveyors, Spice is a restaurant worthy of patronizing and a delight to enjoy. As I live in an area of the country that has a birthed the local, sustainable, and organic movement, a friend of mine suggested we try it out when I came to town.   There were a couple of things that caught my attention from the moment we walked up. First, there was a sign outside promoting the \"Botanical Bar\" in the garden. The second. amazingly, was that this place wasn't packed for a Saturday night. Without a reservation, we had no trouble being seated.   The Botanical Bar is something unusual, housed on the patio - only open from 4-9p - that serves specialty drinks (not available inside) that are concocted from botanicals that Spice grows in its own garden. Among the three of us, we tried seven cocktails, mostly from the Botanical menu. I only remember the Lavender Mojito, and despite that it was made from Bacardi Rum (not my favorite), it was delicious. There was a botanical margarita that I also had, but I can't remember specifically from what it was comprised. One of my friends had a bourbon-based drink. I've never met a bourbon that I liked, despite its increasing popularity, and didn't track the ingredients. I do recall, however, that he enjoyed it.  As for food, I am vegetarian; my friends are not. Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten-free designations are clearly marked, making it easy to navigate the menu for those who embrace those lifestyles. As a vegetarian, I appreciated Spice's knowledgeable and conservative designations. Vegetarian items weren't so marked if, for example, they were fried in oil shared by non-veg items.  Vegetarian options abound, and they were mostly very good. We started with the Mushroom Beignets, the Pickles (which is pickled vegetables, not pickles themselves), the Rainbow Farms Tomatoes, and the Wood Grilled Zucchini. The beignets were sublime, perfectly fried bites of fungi fulfillment, complemented perfectly with a goat cheese creme fraiche. The wood grilled zucchini was delightfully charred with a ricotta top, breadcrumbs, and pine nuts. Its only failing was that it was so small and that we could have devoured far more. The tomato plate, about which the server waxed poetic, was delicious, though not as life-changing as we had been led to believe. That said, I would recommend it.  The mains, to me, were less impressive, but perhaps that's because I am vegetarian. I shared the Roasted Beets and Grilled Endive with one of my companions. Again, the server sang in four-part harmony about its brilliance, but to me, this was my least favorite among the vegetarian samplings. It was accompanied by a maple-almond butter, which to me, was simply too sweet and overpowered the dish. The gentleman who shared the beets also ordered the Soft Shell Crab, a special, which he loved.  His wife ordered the the Smoked Mushroom and Beef Burger, which she, too, thought was well-prepared, if not the most creative among the menu's options. Of course, I tried neither of these.   Vegan options are limited. Perhaps the kitchen can adapt. I'm not vegan; I didn't think to ask. If memory serves correctly, there were only two options - the pickles appetizer and the roasted beet entree, neither of which I'd be compelled to order again. There was a chilled cauliflower soup I would have liked to have tried (as well as another soup on special, also vegetarian, that sounded good).  I might try the local cheese plate.  The flatbreads, while somewhat commonplace, looked incredible from a distance, and I could easily branch out to investigate those samplings - as well as ordering more zucchini - should I ever return with this same menu.  I'd love to see a commitment to organic. I'd love to see more vegan options. I'd love to see Spice's vision catch fire in Northeastern Ohio. I imagine the menu changes seasonally, and there's little doubt that the offerings come winter would be more root vegetables and less fresh bounty from the glory of summer. Still, it's fresh, interesting, well-executed, and unique.  Not inexpensive, but well-worth the splurge.  If one is an omnivore, there's even more to sample.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Really great food in a casual, refined atmosphere and the staff is great. Our server was outstanding. She had great suggestions and really took time with my Dad and I. Do yourself a favor and have a meal here. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"What sold us on Spice of Life for our wedding was their local, sustainable focus and presentation. They were great to work with throughout our planning process, the food was fantastic, and presentation was like nothing you've ever seen before (they give new meaning to \"buffet\"). We also appreciated how with the couple of snafus we encountered Jess and Ben jumped to take care of us completely. They were a pleasure and while we don't plan on having another wedding, we'll definitely be visiting the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I came to this wonderful restaurant for Sunday brunch with my parents, who were visiting. As soon as I walked in, I loved the vibe and decorations. Despite being packed, the restaurant felt spacious and all the employees were friendly.   We ordered the beignets and they were great. It had the right amount of density but airiness. I would have liked a touch more sweetness, but it was otherwise awesome and freshly baked. The creme fraiche that came with the beignets were the highlight and really helped accentuate the texture.  I liked the mismatched mugs/cups that the coffee came in, and I appreciated how our server kept refilling (old school diner style) our cups. Of course, I had to order a mimosa and that was obviously very good. The cups tied in with the whimsical nature of the establishment. We ordered the salmon benedict. Now, this dish was awesome. The eggs were perfectly poached and the side of potatoes really stole the show. I couldn't stop eating them.   The pork belly benedict was also delicious, but I think my father found it a bit too heavy due to the biscuit base. However, the pork belly was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of saltiness and an element of sweetness to it too.  Finally, I ordered the special omelet, namely because it had lamb bacon on it. The eggs were airy and fluffy, and they were wrapped around several avocado stalks. The side of freshly cut fruit was a perfect complement.   Overall, this is a wonderful establishment in Cleveland and the farm-to-table concept is well executed. I would totally visit here again!"}
{"text":"Meets the definition of \"farm to table\". Every appetizer was amazing--the bread, beignets, and mushroom flatbread. The only reason I gave it four stars was because the entrées somewhat missed the mark. Still good but the appetizers were the star of the show."}
{"text":"It was so delicious! The mushroom beingets are a must and I don't even like mushrooms. The burger and steak were both amazing- I loved the salad paired with my steak as well. And the pita! We had the peach upside down cake for dessert that was also good. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"After my initial visits I have been to Spice several times. I simply had to update this... to share that Spice has quickly become one of my favorite Cleveland restaurants!  The bartender Magda is wonderful and charming, and knows how to make many an extra special drink. They have a very nice patio space. The service in general is superb. The food is extremely consistent ....and top notch every time. I enjoy trying their specials, and the happy house which runs from 5:30-7 is superb!   So glad this place is more then holding their own in the new world of Cleveland food based night life.   BIG FAN. A+"}
{"text":"The idea behind Spice is great, and I came in expecting to really like this place.  Fresh, local grown/raised food, served in an upscale fashion.  Unfortunately this place misses the mark.  Not only did I try and order 4 different beers to have the waitress tell me they were out, but I ordered the steak which came pre-cut(??).  By the time it got to me it was cold!  For the most expensive thing on the menu I expected a much better meal."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and had a great time. Service was quick and friendly and entry items were packed with flavor and expertly cooked. Definitely will come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!  For our 3 year anniversary, bf and I decided to try this place based on excellent reviews seen on Yelp and heard from some other people. I was also excited to try it as when I called for reservations, I asked to be seated in a place where we could sit perpendicular. Hostess promised that we could sit at a 4-seater, and was really warm and inviting on the phone.   So we go there today. Hostess shows us to a small 2-seater table squished between two other diner pairs. Ummmmm... where's the 4-seater that they promised?!? Hostess says all the tables were booked and that information was not written down in their books. So we sit on a wobbly 2-person table for the entire night, while all around us, 4-person tables were completely empty. A group of 3 walked in, and didn't have reservations, and got to sit at another 4-person table. Sure, I understand that if they're really busy, we should sit at the 2-person. But, 1) they promised, and 2) they were NOT BUSY.   Server was new. Asked him about the menu. Most of his response was: I have not tasted this. Unacceptable.   Food - subpar. Ordered chickpea fries and mushroom beignets. Did not care for the goat cheese. Just average for entrees - nothing special. The kicker is that when we had 2 chickpea fries left, a server comes up to us, and says \"Your entrees are done. Do you want me to pack this up for you?\" Why the rush??? I have never ever had anyone interrupt me in the middle of appetizers to ask me if I'm done, and if I wanted them boxed. If they had been paying attention, they would have seen that we were still eating, and never once put our forks down for like more than 30 secs.   Ordered roasted chicken and open face bbq sandwich. Chicken was very very bland. Came with red sauce and gnocchi. Gnocchi was definitely nowhere near as good as the ones from Chinato's. These were very doughy and tough. Seemed like a mishmash of different flavors, none of which complimented each other. Tasted like something I could make from a can. Open face bbq sandwich - bread was burnt. If this was on Hell's Kitchen, Gordon Ramsey would have slammed his fist down, and had a hissy fit. Way too mustardy and acidic, even for me, and I love mustard and vinegar. The red cabbage on top did help in reducing the acid. Salt and pepper chips were good, but tasted like warm bagged potato chips.   Drinks - hard cider was sour. Bf did not like his pale ale.   Skipped dessert. Could not handle anymore.  Also, before I finished the last 3 chips on the plate, another server starts taking the plates away without even asking. He just comes up and says, \"let me take these out of your way.\" My hand was still on the plate reaching for a chip as he swoops in to grab the plate away.   For $67 after tax, I expected a lot better. Will not be coming here again. Poor food. Poor service."}
{"text":"Leaving a group of friends and a vendor who was picking up the tab at Market Garden to hit Spice (alone) on your way home isn't the easiest way to check out a new restaurant in town.  But I did it.  And I am sure glad I did.  I figured I'd know at least one person in the place, either at the bar or one of the tables.  Nada.  I shot a quick glance at all the people sitting at the packed bar. Then  I did a quick walk through the newly renovated space, sure I'd find a familiar face at one of the tables.  Nope.  So, I checked the ladies room to see if they'd fixed the horrible lighting that used to be in there.  A quick cursory glance told me they had. Not quite the fix I'd hoped for, but better than what it was.  Then a friendly employee asked if I needed help.  I hesitated for a second, not sure what to say.  Keen to sense my desire to stay even though I didn't know anyone, he says, \"Hey, I know the bar looks like it's packed but there's two employees sitting at the end and it's our policy if a patron comes in, we seat them.\"  Awesome.  I can't think of a better way to get great service than to displace someone from their bar stool as they're enjoying a beverage.  Before I could protest he was seating me where a couple of what would typically be considered as friendly faces, used to be seated.  Turns out Rachel, Ben and Gina actually were happy I'd stopped in on my own and were only too eager to offer me their recommendations on what to order.  The Malbec was exactly what I was craving after having just had Market Garden's new 'All Fuggled Up'.  The Preserved Squash Risotto is cravable.    Many eating establishments have graced us with their presence at 5800 Detroit.  Given their warm staff, friendly atmosphere and delectable menu, let's hope this one is here to stay.  Thanks for welcoming a lone patron and good luck and prosperity to you guys.  -Gina"}
{"text":"Amazing locally sourced creative cuisine in what has up to now been an unlucky location for restaurants.  This chef has broken the curse!!  Highlights are the risotto, local cheese plate, chilled beet soup, and amazing tacos.  The atmosphere is upscale but relaxed and cozy, with a natural flair.  Their special cocktails are worth a look - the last time we were there, I had a strawberry cocktail with cracked black pepper.  Yum!  They just opened a great patio in the back, and it's lovely for drinks or dinner on a summer evening.  Also, bonus points for offering the happy hour menu on the patio!  We've had nothing but friendly, efficient service, and creative food here, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I love about Cleveland. A hip spot with fantastic food that won't blow your budget. We came on a Saturday, and this place was packed. Lucky we had a reservation and were seated right away. My husband and I loved it. But I can see bringing my Dad here and his thinking that it's too loud and too dark. (I always wonder when I'm going to get to that age. Shudder at the thought.) Ambiance was great and had good energy. The food was great and service couldn't be beat either. Our only regret was that the bar was packed after dinner so we couldn't stop for one last delightful artisinal cocktail. Oh well. Next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times over the past few years.  Always solid and always good service in the bar area.  I've had the mushroom beignets, the pork skins with the IPA vinegar, various salads, etc.  Highly recommend any whiskey cocktail paired with walnut butters when they have it.  Good area to be in since one can galavant on foot between here, Happy Dog, and Toast."}
{"text":"I love this place. You have a different experience every time you go since the menu changes frequently to what vegetables are in season. The food at spice lives up to the expectation in the restaurants name...food is so flavorful and the atmosphere is great! GreAt patio in the warmer months!"}
{"text":"So good.  Stopped in several weeks ago for dinner and drinks and again tonight for just drinks. Everything we've had has been so good. Some of the best cocktails in the city and delicious food! My favorite is the Terragon Wild cocktail!   David is a fantastic bartenter/mixologist and everything he makes is delicious!  A great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Brunch is amazing, dinner is amazing, the drinks, dessert - everything you really can't go wrong. They also have an awesome happy hour that goes until 7pm which is later than most places. I highly recommend Spice to all my friends and family because the farm to table quality of the food is outstanding and the it is delicious. Been here several times and plan to return for many more!"}
{"text":"While not needed on a Friday night, you can make a reservation right here on Yelp (though not Open Table). The patio, though right off the small rear parking lot, is fenced in and quiet. White lights criss cross over top and a variety of seating options, including couches, encourage you to stay awhile.   Our server was friendly and helpful in making menu decisions describing the size and flavors of dishes and mentioning her favorites. The food came out relatively quick, but the speed at which the bar produced drinks was abysmal; you forgot you had ordered a drink by the time it showed up. Rosemary's Baby Mule however was good.   For dinner we got 4 small plates to share. The flat bread was the largest of the four. The current one on the menu, different from what is posted online now, was a mushroom flatbread. I enjoyed that and the corn stuffed dumplings the most. While I'm usually a massive fan of charcuterie boards, this one, while piled with items, wasn't the freshest tasting or the most enjoyable and no mustard was presented as listed on the menu. The pirogies were my least favorite. There were three to an order with spinach and cheese inside and a heavy cream sauce on top.    Overall I much preferred my last brunch experience (5 stars on food, fewer on service) compared to dinner."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Spice. They have nailed it in terms of food, atmosphere and service. Their back patio is perfect for the summer months in Cleveland. The fresh specials are always delicious. Tonight we had their rosemary focaccia bread service and mushroom beignets as starters. Both were incredibly good. As our main meals I had their special, which was a flaky white fish served with puttanesca and my boyfriend ordered the burger. Both were very flavorful and prepared perfectly. My favorite dish of the night was their basil cheesecake. It's everything you could want from a dessert; fresh, bright, creamy, really just truly delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing..... the local cheese board was unbelievable.... service was great   Had Salmon was really good ..."}
{"text":"We went here for Valentines day. The service was very good. Got our reserved table right away, got our drinks right away, and didn't wait too long for the food. I also didn't feel rushed. The interior is cozy and they have a nice looking bar as well.  They have some interesting appetizers but the dinner menu was a bit small. We ordered two appetizers, the mushroom fritters and the pork pot stickers. Both were very good. I preferred the pot stickers.   For dinner I ordered the lamb shank with polenta. The lamb was braised to perfection. It was tender and juicy and fall off the bone. The polenta was creamy and good. My wife got the noodle bowl which she said was delicious.   I'd definitely go back. It would be a convenient place to dine after a movie at the Capitol."}
{"text":"A Saturday night date, we got the lamb burger and the pork chop special. Both plates were so delicious! Juicy, tender, flavorful. The fries were great with the burger, and the mashed potatoes, kale, and smoked Apple butter added great flavors to the pork chop.   Service was attentive, atmosphere was intimate.   Ps, oatmeal cream pie for dessert...Y-U-M!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch with a group of 15. The service, table set up, and food were all incredible. I'd go anytime, but I also strongly recommend this restaurant for larger groups."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I came here for drinks a few weeks ago. The cocktail menu was interesting to say the least. It was certainly a fun evening.   We each had one drink before going to our next stop for dinner. The pricing for the drinks seemed fair. The place has an awesome ambiance.   I'm holding onto the fifth star because I didn't try their food, and I don't think I want to. I looked at the menu, and nothing, at all, looked like something I personally would enjoy. I'm sure the food is delicious, but their menu doesn't appeal to me personally.   I would totally come back here again. I definitely recommend this place for a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate because I had high hopes based on prior reviews, and maybe it was just a sloppy uncharacteristic night.  But I won't be going back after such a disappointing night.  I ordered the Walleye, and the flavor profile was spot on.  The combination of ingredients were well-complementing, it should have been a great dish.  But from the instant the plate was presented, it was 'off.'  There was a clear lack of attention to detail: the pieces of fish were falling apart and looked like it was sliced (if you could even call that slicing) by a kid with 2 left hands. The plate was covered in sauce everywhere and looked a general mess.  One tries to overlook such silliness as presentation if the food is amazing.  But I couldn't even eat more than the first 1/3 of my dish -- it was sooo salty! The bf LOVES salty, and even he said it was too salty.  I was drinking so much water just to try and eat the dish, the server refilled my water 4 times for me to eat the 1 piece of fish.  The bf had steak.  The steak was cooked well (he always orders medium, and it was medium). It was seasoned well and served with potatoes, mushrooms, and some green that I can't recall.  The dish was covered in a sauce that once again, was way too salty.  We managed to pick off all the sides that were covered with the sauce and eat the steak with the veggies that weren't sauced.  Maybe they accidentally salted the dish twice. Maybe the person running the pass was doing it for the first time and too overwhelmed to check our dish. Maybe they were understaffed in the kitchen and they found the service to be too much on this quiet weekday evening.  Maybe it doesn't matter, and I'll be finding dinner at one of many other excellent restaurants in town.  The flavor combination should have been a good one, I like the farm to table fresh food dining idea, and the restaurant looked nice... But wouldn't eat here anymore.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Seems like the perfect casual comfortable neighborhood joint on the corner. I'm not from that neighborhood but i'd certainly come out and visit when I can. Relaxed in the sense that drinks are served in mason jars and the decor is farmhouse home-y. I love that the menu is seasonal and tries to rely on locally grown produce as well as produce the owners grow themselves.  The food is delicious. We started with the mushroom beignets, which were interesting concept and for me in worked. We had the seared chicken breast (by recommendation) and ribeye. I'm not a big fan of ordering chicken when out--most of the time seems bland. But Spice did it right and it was perfectly rendered and delicious with the side of spaetzle and vegetables. My fiance kept stealing my food. The ribeye was equally good and most importantly cooked right to what we requested. To finish, we had the chai pot du creme with shortbread. Great end to the evening."}
{"text":"The service in this place was so slow. I was one of only a few patrons on a Saturday afternoon and it took forever to dine and check out.   I ordered the Apple beignets and the Dixie Benedict. The beignets were great, the goat cheese dipping sauce was a little strange, but complemented the sweet flavor well. The Dixie Benedict, was extremely disappointing. I love eggs Benedict so I was excited to try this new take on it but it wasn't good. The pork and biscuit was good but the fried egg wasn't fried. It was just burnt. If I can sound snobby for a second, it's not hard to cook eggs, but to cook them well and as listed, is another thing. A fried egg is not a burnt egg but that's what my egg was. The hot sauce hollandaise didn't taste hot or like hollandaise. Lastly, the smash Browns...I'm not sure what they were. Was it a baked potato that they mashed after baking? Was it large hash browns? Not entirely sure but either way, it had no flavor.   The food wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. Maybe brunch isn't their specialty. I would consider returning to try their dinner menu in the future but my expectations are pretty low coming in."}
{"text":"It is a real treat for me to visit a restaurant such as Spice which is so committed to a full expression of the (hackneyed though the term may be) farm-to-table ethos.   I loved chatting with my favorite vendors at the North Union Farmer's Market this past Saturday morning knowing that the same fresh, local produce, cheese, and meat my husband and I buy for our home would be served to us that evening when we went to Spice for a celebratory dinner.  As we were celebrating a special occasion, we really went all out and, as a result, experienced a sampling of at least one item from each section of the menu. The seasonal items were enjoyed included:   - Peach and Bacon Salad with whipped House-made Ricotta  - Pan-Friend Mushroom and Pork Dumplings  - Wild Mushroom Tart - Spicy Gumbo - Basil Cheesecake with Peach Coulis - The Piece la Resistance: a 42-Day Aged Cumin-Rubbed Skirt Steak  Every morsel of each above-listed dish was par excellance! It was truly a meal to be savored and one which we will think back on fondly for some time.  We enjoyed wonderful service to accompany the incredible food. The staff kindly accommodated our request to be moved to a less noisy portion of the dining room upon arrival.   As an aside, I would dispute the $$ price-range rating of Spice's listing here on Yelp. A meal at Spice is strictly a $$$ affair - and worth every dollar! To keep within the $$ range one could order an entree only - no drinks, appetizers or dessert - but I fail to see the point in that!"}
{"text":"I visited Spice Kitchen + Bar on Sunday 4/8/18 because I woke up and wanted a really good brunch and this place never disappoints.  I've been to Spice a few times (for brunch only, I still have to try dinner), but have never posted a review. After working and living in Cleveland for years, I can say without a doubt that this is definitely one of the top contenders for the best brunch in Cleveland, if not the best place to go.  The farm to table dishes are delicious.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting and if you come early, it's not a chaotic mess like some of the other popular restaurants in Tremont.  The staff was also very friendly and seemed to operate like a big family.  The general vibe here is very pleasant.  I ordered the biscuits + gravy with mushroom tuffle gravy and the sausage add on.  This is listed as a \"beginning\" on the menu, but was just the right amount of food for me.  I had tried other menu items in the past, so I wanted to try something different.  The dish was very tasty and it arrived quick which was nice as well.  I also ordered a seasonal juice mixture that included watermelon, pineapple, mint and ginger, that was also nice and very refreshing.   I'm including a picture of the smoked verlasso salmon benedict and seasonal fruit beignets in my review as well.  These were from a prior visit to Spice, but I figured I would smash them into this review.  The benedict was one of the best i've ever had and the \"smash browns\" aka potatoes that come with it are really really good.  The beignets were top notch as well.  I definitely would get those again.  Overall, I highly recommend Spice to anyone looking for a delicious brunch in Cleveland! It's hard to go back to mediocre restaurants after coming here."}
{"text":"Before I went to Spice, it was introduced to me as the best restaurant in Cleveland. It would be unfair to every other restaurant in the city if I, too, declared Spice was the best only because I haven't seen all the north shore has to offer. Still, Spice HAS to be up there. I got the steak special, forgot to snap a picture, but it was like butter!   Surprising, we didn't wait, probably because we went to dinner early--around 6:45. The service was even better than the food, by the way. Thanks, Keith!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Sunday brunch. I've been here once before for dinner but we sat at the bar and it was an odd time of day, so I don't want to call upon that experience for this review.  Three of us came for brunch on Sunday - we made a reservation through Yelp! and that was a very easy process. They were ready for us when we got there which was nice.  First, the service was great - my water and coffee cup stayed full throughout the meal and everyone was very friendly. Loved that.  For a starter we shared the biscuits and mushroom gravy. Since I don't eat pork, I was thrilled that they had a gravy that was not pork based! It was very flavorful. Loved it. The biscuits are buttery and dense but flaky at the same time, just like a good biscuit is.  For my meal I got the mushroom and squash migas. Very very nice flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My meal was a 5 star meal.  My sister had the cured salmon and eggs and she seemed to like it. Was a very large portion as well. The hubs had the french toast - it was kinda dry but the flavors were there! and the apples on top were very tasty.  The prices were fair for the portion sizes and this place offers menu items that are slightly different for the run of the mill breakfast place. I definitely want to come back and try a few other items - (namely the chicken and waffles). Overall, I was very satisfied! Thanks Spice for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Chicken entree was a bit overcooked with the chicken kinda rubbery and the potatoes hard like it was under a heat lamp for awhile. The scallops entree however was cooked well, seasoned tastefully, and had a great combo of ingredients.  I was impressed with the locally sourced and season menu options.  Service was a bit slow but it looked like our waitress had a 12 top party she was also attending to. I will come back again to update my review to see if this is consistent."}
{"text":"This is my first review in a MINUTE but I love, love, love Spice, had a wonderful experience last night, and I'm trying to take a stab at this whole regular Yelping thing :)   So my boyfriend and I came in on Sunday for our anniversary after making reservations on OpenTable. Spice made sure to give us a friendly call the day before to confirm our 7:30 reservation and as a courtesy let us know that there would be special menu on Sunday night. A+ customer service right there.   We went to a movie at the Capitol down the street and got out wayyyyyy earlier than we had initially thought. Not usually my style but there we were, on our way, and almost 40 mins ahead of our rezzy. So I called to give them a head's up and said we'd have no problem chillin' at the bar until the table was ready. When we arrived it was a really light crowd. Atmosphere, as always, was on point. I love how they serve water in mason jars and the fresh flower arrangements they display in little glass vases are always a really lovely touch :) The bartender was friendly, handed us the special menu written on a slate slab in chalk, and talked us through one of their specialty cocktails using juice from Daily Press. As soon as my beautiful, frothy, tart, and delicious citrus-y drink arrived (see photo) we were walked to our table by the even friendlier hostess who wished us a happy anniversary.   At our table, we were given the run down on the menu options. To be completely honest, we were like 'da f@#%??' looking at a few of the items described before us. But our waiter was awesome and talked us through just about everything, answering any and all questions we had. Taking his suggestions, we decided to be adventurous and get some appetizers: brussel sprouts and gratin potatoes as well as an order of sunchokes. What are sunchokes, you ask? Apparently, he told us, they're sunflower roots. Also called the Jerusalem artichoke, they have the consistency of an apple crossed with a potato. Intriguing. Sunflowers are not only my favorite flower but I also, coincidentally, just got back from Jerusalem. So we went for it. HOLY DELICIOUSNESS. They came out baked, seasoned, and oiled to literal perfection. Definitelyyyyyyy try these if you get the chance. The brussel sprouts/gratin potatoes were fab, too, but these were A++++.   For my entree I ordered the super yummy pumpkin/pork ravioli (see photo), which I initially thought was sort of an odd pairing. It turned out to be fan-fricken-tastic. I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the flavors went together. The sunchokes were hard to beat, but I was very happy with my selection. After seeing 'The Revenant,' my bf decided to go the Leo route and order bison. Just an average Sunday, tryin' some bison. It was rare (more to his liking than mine) and had a really flavorful marmalade on top.   Long story short, it was a fantastic overall dining experience. Food, atmosphere, drinks, and service were superb. The ONLY reason I'm giving my review 4/5 stars is the fact that there was a particularly noisy party of 4 in our immediate vicinity :\ Not necessarily the fault of Spice, but we could hear every single word they were saying to each other. It was quite obnoxious and unfortunate. Maybe that's the downside of going on a slow night? A few loud people can come in and slightly diminish an otherwise cozy, romantic, wonderful experience. But well done to Spice, though! Truly. You'll definitely see us again soon :)"}
{"text":"Spice is an excellent establishment, and brings a lot to both our bellies and city.  Great food and knowledgeable staff, perhaps the best of each in the western hemisphere (at least west of the Cuyahoga).  I'm a big fan of the Steelhead flat bread - delicious cured salmon, local mixed greens and lemon drizzle.    The atmosphere is elegant enough to feel like a \"special\" place, however also casual enough to avoid any sense of pretension.  I imagine this balance will prove attractive to a more diverse customer base than more explicitly formal venues like Crop on Lorain.  Their emphasis on local and sustainable sources for their ingredients (as well as only serving dishes based in seasonally-growing options) ensures you won't be eating the usual processed foods or anything from too far away (distance-wise).   The entrees taste made with love, rather than haste.  I highly recommend Spice and expect great things as word of mouth gains momentum!  Looking forward to the spring menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food. Went here for date night. The two of us had one appitizer and two nightly specials posted on the board, and one entree. It was the perfect size portions for the both of us. No doggie bag here! Rich, flavorful, fresh, but not heavy! We ordered:  Polenta frittes (my favorite choice)  Squash soup - delicious flavor Pierogis - had a pleasently great combination of beets and onion topping Rabbit ravioli - wild and slightly gamey, but suburb flavor with no heavy thick sauce (Thank God!) O Baby it's Cold Out cocktail we ordered twice because of its tastiness Dirty martini recommendation was on par  Rye cocktail (forget the name) was great also!    I do have to comment on the service and atmosphere as well. Very attentive, friendly , and quick staff. Bonus, the place is beautiful. Great job, guys and dolls! Can't wait to go back."}
