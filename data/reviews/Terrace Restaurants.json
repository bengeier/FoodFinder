{"text":"Went for breakfast today for the first time. I had the steak with egg whites, hash browns and a biscuit.  The steak was juicy and tender.  I usually ask for my hash browns to be well done but not here.  They were crunchy on the top just right in the middle.  The way I like them.  New spot definitely."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is wonderful place for brunch. My husband took me for my birthday brunch and we had lovely time. It was weekend so we had to wait for sometime before we got seating but trust me it was worth the wait. We ate so much we could hardly move :) I guess this is best way to celebrate birthday! I loved their famous Red Velvet Waffles. Great Service and great food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We go at least 3 times a month for breakfast.  The food is always delicious and timely.  The kitchen staff is top notch. The waitstaff is very professional and friendly.  We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Kids favorite of all brunch/breakfast places we have been.  Had eggs Benedict, quite good! At our table we ordered waffles.  Blueberry pancakes and a order of French toast.   Oj fresh squeezed.  Coffee excellent"}
{"text":"We ave been here for breakfast and dinner several times.  It's really good food and really creative.  Family friendly too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in all of the food that myself . Visiting Charlotte for the weekend  and wasted my time at this place. The only reason they received two stars one for the hostess and the Cupcake Latte I ordered. The food was awful I spent $50 bucks for two people and neither one of us really enjoyed anything. It was hard to see all the people lined up to get Inside and not tell them how the food taste... While i did NOT any eggs I didn't not have to. This place did not make the cut!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Terrace Cafe for the first time. When we arrived we were told the wait would be around 35 minutes. We weighed our options and decided to stay. It was very cold and rainy so we waited right inside the cafe. As we were waiting we noticed that the seating arrangements made no sense. They seated two people at a table for four, when a family of four had been waiting for a while. They did this multiple times then had to push two tables together to seat families of three or four. We also had to ask if our table was ready as it had been over 35 minutes. Once seated, our waiter quickly introduced himself and asked for our drink order. Next, he asked for our meal order. Our food came quite quickly, and it tasted pretty good. My older sister ordered pancakes, and was very impressed. My younger sister ordered two animal pancakes, an egg, and bacon. She was also very happy. Both my parents ordered chicken and waffles, and enjoyed the food as well. I ordered a red velvet waffle with a side of grits and bacon. While the food was good, it was not amazing. Enjoyed the experience but the 35 minute wait was not quite worth the food."}
{"text":"Could not even eat the egg whites because they were so oily! Gross! Don't think I will order from here again..."}
{"text":"It's busy, but once you get tagged \"Best Breakfast in Charlotte\" you'd expect that. Exceptional coffee, food, ambiance, and service!!! Top notch!!! It is all well worth the wait....and yes the red velvet waffle was that good! : )"}
{"text":"Food is really good.  But, the service is extremely slow. For some reason, they have difficulty with large groups.  Strange for a breakfast and brunch restaurant.  If you have plenty of time and don't mind a long wait, this is definitely a great option.  If you have a group of six or more, call ahead."}
{"text":"I was staying nearby and wanted a yummy spot for breakfast, yelp told me this was a good spot. I was not disappointed. I was there around 9am on a weekday, so not very busy. All the staff were super friendly and accommodating. I really like how the menu has some funny, quirky items, like the red velvet waffle (what I had and holey-moley was it awesome!), the banana split yogurt parfait, and a chocolate covered cherry latte. The food was very good and service great. When I told my server I thought the latte was not flavored enough, she took it back and added more syrup.  There was a lot of seating, but I could see why this place might get packed with people at peak times. I will be going back here again the next time I am in Charlotte for sure!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Charlotte I like to visit local spots like this due to the lack of non-chain restaurants in the queen city. Stopped by on a week night wasn't packed at all. Decided to try something new off the menu, squash ravioli which was really good, the dessert was even better.   Many are aware of Terrace Cafe excellent breakfast (served all day) but the lunch and dinner selections are worth the try. The service was great as always. Our waiter definitely made the right recommendations. The laid back atmosphere, on this night was a plus the lights were dim throughout the restaurant which made me look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles and chicken was a good portion and very delicious, I will definitely keep this on my favorite food list. Staff was attentive and setting was nice."}
{"text":"I decided to start writing reviews again. Here is the first one.  Not sure if the restaurant's name changed. I ate at Terrace restaurant for lunch 4 weeks ago while in town.   Food: chicken waffles - flavor is decent, but was dry BLT sandwich - Looked and tasted as if a 10-year old child made it Soup - Can't remember what type, but do remember it was lukewarm Steak fries - Had to chase down the waitress to get it. 5 (literally) bandage-size fries came out on a small worn-out side plate...  Bill - Waitress told us fries was included as a side, but then charged us $5. Had to ask her to remove it. 5 for 5 bandage-sized fries???"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My friend and I went for brunch and to share giggles and it was the perfect place. She ordered the red velvet waffles and I ordered a turkey salad. When items arrived my mouth watered just a little due to the great presentation of the food. The salad was just not any ordinary salad the warm bacon crumbs mixed in with their homemade dressing and bread crumbs was so yummy.The staff was also very nice."}
{"text":"Visiting NC and friends recommended Terrace for breakfast. Very family friendly. I ordered the fried green tomatoes and southern sausage eggs Benedict. Husband had shrimp and grits. Both of us really enjoyed our meal. The fried green tomatoes were out of this world delicious. This will be our main spot whenever we visit."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I went were,  but my mouth is still watering for the lemon poppyseed French toast.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Terrace Cafe for lunch a few times, but recently tried it for dinner.  I was a little disappointed they weren't serving the red velvet waffles at dinner time, but I went ahead and ordered from the dinner menu.  The chicken was delicious!!  I was not disappointed!  My husband said his mussels were excellent also."}
{"text":"The customer service by our waiter and the manager was completely inept. You would expect a complete apology and regret from the manager when you informed them that our kids ate MOLD from the fruit. Same type of mold you see in strawberries left in your fridge.   No type of communication or sincere apology. We were asked \"WHY\" when we cancelled our order. Well...what do you expect.   We aren't the type to complain as my wife and I have been servers in the past. But, we do know how this should have been handled.  Edit...similar review by Mai T in March. So please issue your standard apology reply here."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday morning and we were sat upstairs.  It took forever to get someone for our water, to take our order, for the food to be served, and even for the check.  The breakfast here was nothing to write home about.  Had their egg benedict, but they put whole grain mustard in their hollandaise sauce - which gives it a very sour taste instead of the slight hint of lemon juice - and it's just wrong.  Overpriced for the subpar service and mediocre food.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The location of the place is really nice.  The staff pleasant and the food even better.  Definitely worth the effort!"}
{"text":"Like a previous reviewer, I was underwhelmed with the Full Breakfast that I ordered during my first visit to Terrace Cafe last week for lunch.  It wasn't bad, but for half the price I had the same thing at The Original Pancake House  this morning and enjoyed it just as much or possibly more.  Granted, I could have ordered something with a little bit more imagination, but if a restaurant can't handle simple things then I have to wonder whether or not it can handle more complex items.    The hummus appetizer we ordered arrived with sesame seed covered pita for dipping.  Unfortunately, I can't say much for the hummus because it was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of the sesame seeds on the pita.  I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, so I took one bite and left it at that.  My companion ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and really enjoyed it.  He also enjoyed the hummus more than I, but he likes sesame seeds so....  Thanks to a $30 gift certificate from Groupon, our lunch tab was only $18.00.  (I paid $12 for GC and left $6 tip.)  Without the GC, our tab would have been almost twice as much.  I'll try Terrace Cafe again because I have another gift certificate.  Hopefully next time I'll be as pleased with my meal as some of the other reviewers."}
{"text":"Well, where to begin... so we ate there at around 9 on a weekday, Rather slow time of the day, yet you couldn't tell from server presence. Real nice guy that served us. He started out super nice and approachable, then he just vanished after opening spiel. This is when it's crumbled, bad food plus lack of care on staffs part. Shrimp m grits, shrimp grotesquely undercooked, and it was possible either microwaved or boiled. . Nastee!!! Then my friends hash browns we're burned on outside yet chilled in center. This is when you know that nobody is concerned is when all the shrimp are still on plate yet grits r eaten. One would think to ask if there was something wrong with the dish, being main component was not ate. SERVER SIMPLY HURRIED ALONG AND DROPPED CHECK, NOT ONCE ASKING HOW OUR MEAL WAS. POOR FORM. LACKLUSTER STAFF WILL/AND DOES BRING THE RESTAURANT DOWN. A CHARISMATIC  SERVER WOULD OF HANDLED THIS WITH CARE AND WOULD MAKE ME NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM, NOT HEIGHTEN CURRENT SITUATION."}
{"text":"Terrace Café red velvet waffle was delicious!! The scrambled eggs were good and the fruit was fresh. I also had dinner at Terrace Cafe before but the red velvet waffle was the highlight of my food experience."}
{"text":"The service here is awful. Walked in and asked for a table for 5... the hostess didn't take my name and said to hold on 'right there' for a few minutes. I literally stood about 5 steps in front of the stand. After about 15 minutes I went up to her and she stated, \"oh I thought we seated you.\" Then she took my name. We waited for about 15 more minutes and in that time one of the members of our party began feeling sick. He went to lay down in the car when they called our name. We stated that we had four people now - and they said they could no longer seat us because they had a 6-top... and we would require a 4-top. We did not want to be moved to the back of the list AGAIN, so we went to get our friend from the car. After about two minutes, our friend returned and when they brought us up to our table... we were at a four seater with an additional chair jammed into the corner.  This is after them telling us they could not seat us w/ only four people because they reserved a larger table. We saw the larger table open and asked the hostess if we could move there and she said, 'she's just doing what they told her' and when someone in our party suggested we should leave after all this she said, 'that's fine' and walked away without saying anything further. We were left standing in the middle of the restaurant. We looked over the banister and saw they had moved on, seating other parties. It should also be noted that there were MANY MANY open tables. As we walked out, the manager saw us leaving and didn't say a word. A member of our party had to ask if he was the manager. As she told the manager what happened and he did not say sorry ONCE. I have been here before... and the food is good... but it is not worth the headache. The hostesses clearly do not give a sh*t and have no idea what they're doing, and the manager doesn't seem that concerned either.  We went to McDonald's across the street instead and received better customer service there. Seriously."}
{"text":"Had brunch at the Terrace Cafe on a recent weekend morning. It is a bit ironic that a place called the Terrace Cafe doesn't have any outdoor seating, but my understanding is that the other location does? We waited about 20 minutes for a table and were seated upstairs. Our waitress was very friendly and personable (Julie, I think.) I had the salted caramel latte, which was delicious, as well as the biscuit and gravy with fruit salad. They make the sausage in house, and it was very good. The dish comes with one large biscuit, smothered in their cream sausage gravy. I was a happy camper. My one complaint was that the fruit salad was a little bit warm - I would have preferred it cold and fresh out of the fridge. I'm sure we'll return for brunch, but I'd also like to try some of their lunch and dinner offerings -"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Terrace Cafe but it won't be my last. Everything was pleasant. The inside is a nice little cafe atmosphere with two levels to it. From the time we walked it we were greeted with friendly smiles. Our wait was only 30 mins so that wasn't bad. I had the Red Velvet. Waffles with Fried Chicken. Everything was deliscious. The chicken wasn't over cooked and had a great flavor to it. The Grits were just how I like them, nice and creamy. The Mimosa was even great. I look forward to coming back and trying the Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Food was great the red velvet waffle was awesome!!!! If you visit the Queen City you should try it out"}
{"text":"Drinks were delicious, food didn't live up to the hype.  Shrimp and grits were the worst I've ever had and the fried green tomatoes were descent.  Greeters were awesome but waiter kept disappearing and not checking in on the group... All in all I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Waffle with Cream Cheese drizzle was perfect. I was worried it would be overwhelmingly sweet but it wasn't at all. It was surprisingly light, yet flavorful and I wanted more. I also got the chicken to make this more like a chicken and waffles but I wasn't a fan of the chicken. It was a piece of fried chicken breast. This wasn't a deal breaker for me. My hubs had the shrimp and grits and they were good. We will return here and it is a good place to try out."}
{"text":"Boring menu average food"}
{"text":"The food here is nothing short of amazing I love the shrimp and grits the red velvet waffle and  drinks. Always great service and great food I have been many times"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I's favorite breakfast spot. Pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, or ever give 5 stars, but I had one of the BEST breakfasts I have ever had at Terrace Cafe. I'm a big fan of red velvet cake, so when I saw they had a red velvet waffle, I had to try it. In a word: AMAZING. Not too sweet, light fluffy batter, cream cheese \"syrup\".... Like nothing I've ever had before. I ordered it with fried chicken, which was a boneless, generously sized crispy piece of all white meat, served on the side. I put it on the waffle for a pure decadent taste experience. Yum, yum, yum!  And as a side note, my order came with hash browns, which were some of the best I've ever had. Obviously they were fresh, shredded by hand with just the right amount of onion mixed in for flavor, and fried to a crispy golden finish on top. My boyfriend is kind of a picky eater, and he could not stop raving about how great the hash browns were.  Excellent service, full bar (I had a mimosa), and a nice comfortable atmosphere (we ate outside) all make this place a \"must visit\" whenever I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've had all great experiences trying new restaurants in Charlotte until this one.  The best way to describe my experience would be like when you get overcharged for a buffet at a fancy hotel. I ordered the \"chef's special hash\" for $15, which was very plain, simple, and small. Eggs, hash browns, and a few peppers.  I looked at my plate and told my wife, \"this is something we could have easily made at home\""}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before? Cute place with a great atmosphere. Their menu has a great variety.  I had their Hawaiian Chicken Salad Croissant Sandwich. Yum! I had their vinegar based coleslaw, which I loved. It's how my mom makes her coleslaw...but mayo slaw lovers my not be a fan.  The price is pretty decent. I'd rather go here for a couple extra bucks and quality than the Panera across the street.  I hear their breakfast is awesome too. Red Velvet Pancakes?? Awesome!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast. The Terrace Cafe is a must go there culinary gem. Wonderful, satisfying, and unique breakfast fare. A red velvet waffle topped with a light cream cheese drizzle was placed in front of me with a perfectly cooked piece of boneless fried chicken. The waffle was magical; not too heavy and not over-the-top sweet. It was decadent. The chicken came out piping hot and was cooked perfectly; moist and encapsulated in a light and crunchy breading; the kind of breading that inspires you to pick the remnants up off the plate with the pads of your fingers. The chicken was so delicious, I ordered a fried chicken eggs benedict. The same amazing chicken with two perfectly poached eggs; not to runny, not too hard. And the hollandaise sauce was rich and light all at once and didn't over-power the eggs.  The staff here is amazing. They have incredible coffee that was served to us by a coffee genius named Ben. The heart atop my cappuccino stayed until I finished it.  Our waiter Chris was fantastic and friendly and very patient with my food indecisiveness. Patrick the chef as incredible. It's obvious the staff here care about their product and their service. I can't say enough about the wonderful experience my husband and I had here. Counter area seating is first come first serve but if you do encounter a line, you must wait. It will be worth it.  There are not enough stars to give. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to say I was not a fan of the service, but it was a Sunday brunch and quite packed so I'll definitely return for another try.   I went with a friend, he ordered an omelet, I had a quiche. The food was wonderfully executed, the portions we perfect and the atmosphere was excellent.   We were excited to try a dessert, but in the haste of a full section we asked for dessert menus and the waitress had already prepared the check. Que sera, sera, I walked out in a great mood with a full stomach.   I can't wait to go back at a less busy time to see what the atmosphere would be like in a different setting!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast we've had in Charlotte! The service was amazing!  The food was great! Kaitlin our server was awesome! Definitely coming back to eat again! Nothing like this from where we're from."}
{"text":"Delicious! Attentive wait staff. Food came out really quickly. I really enjoyed the upper level seating."}
{"text":"Dont believe the hype with this place  Red Velvet Waffle with chicken!!! The cream cheese drizzle on top of the waffle  was decent. Chicken was two small tenders and not enough meat to be satisfied. I couldn't eat the hash browns, it smell weird and were under cooked. The waffle was tasteless and a bust.  The food  was a big disappointment and definitely not worth paying $18.00! It looked much better than it tasted.   Dont waste your time coming here. It is located in a nice area, but the cafe is very small with limited seating and looks outdated for the area.   Go somewhere else if your craving chicken and waffles. There was another location in Charlotte that sells it for $5.00-$7.00 with great reviews. If you choose to go here and feel disappointed after. You can only blame yourself, you was warned"}
{"text":"Personally, I did not enjoy my salad. Went out to dinner with a group of friends for my sister's birthday... Our waiter forgot to put in the order for my boyfriends food. So he sat while everyone ate. By the time we got it everyone was done eating. We took his food to go instead. The waiter didn't even give us a reasoning and wasn't willing to accommodate us for the inconvenience, and to top it off, gave us an attitude when we asked to speak to the manager.  A basic plain caesar salad was $6. I had iceberg lettuce, croutons, and added chicken.... $15. $11 for a piece of chicken?? All in all, never ever ever going back there. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Over priced. The atmosphere sucks. Loud. Cramped. Portions of food are small... Leave you feeling hungry still. Would rather just go to Chili's."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! The hubby and I have been twice for brunch and both times were amazing. Yes the wait is long but it's worth it. The mimosas and bellinis are on point and the fried green tomatoes are perfect. My absolute favorite is the red waffle and chicken. It's not too sweat and the flavors come together nicely."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here! Everything is always delicious. This time we tried the fried green tomatoes... Sooooo tasty! Hot and crispy with spicy dipping sauce! Service was excellent. Definitely our favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places in Charlotte! Right down the road from my home, this places never disappoints. The service is always top-notch and the staff is extremely friendly.   I always get the Red Velvet Waffle with extra cream cheese drizzle (no shame) with a side of cheese grits. HEAVEN! I go to school in New England and I'm always overjoyed when I get to come home and head to the Terrace Cafe."}
{"text":"Peeking out from the corner behind Taco Mac in Piedmont Row is Terrace Café. With a menu boasting S'mores French Toast and Red Velvet Waffles, there is often a wait list of people seeking an indulgent breakfast on weekends.  If there is no time to lose waiting for the hungry masses who beat you there, visit on a weekday, when there generally is not a wait.  Don't want dessert for breakfast? No matter, there is something for every taste and moderation level. Terrace Café even has a few dishes decorated with the seal of approval from the Harris Y Express and YMCA nutritionist. There is an obvious partnership there, as post-Y workout customers clad in sweats join groups of SouthPark soccer moms dining among local celebrities at Terrace. No, not Ric Flair (WOOO!) this time, but jack-of-all media, Jon Wilson (WILSON!)  According to the clearly over sat server, the Red Velvet Waffle is their breakfast bestseller. It is surprisingly airy and moist, and the well-portioned cream cheese drizzle is just the right amount of sweet to keep that nagging \"sugar belly\" sensation at bay.  Eggs Benedict and cheese grits that rival those at The Flying Biscuit are stars of the savory menu choices, and dishes are presented beautifully on geometrically angled platters. Seasonal fruit tops off the gluttony, and beverages are served in curved glasses that look like they'll tip, but due to the magic of physics, do not.  Your full belly may make you tip, though, after sampling the fine foods at Terrace Café."}
{"text":"Atmosphere good Service excellent Timeliness average Accomodating Food average- bisquits and gravy ok but we've had better.  Trademark breakfast casserole was good, not great - a little dry and overcooked.   Trendy. Value for price was ok.  Bacon was awesome - nice & crispy.  Steak was average - little guy added ketsup.  Service staff awesome Atmosphere awesome Food good.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good experience for dinner date. Definitely was pretty empty/quiet. Go for brunch if you want it to feel like a \"terrace cafe\". Food's always good. Server accommodated paleo request to boot!"}
{"text":"This will be one of my staple brunch spots when I'm in Charlotte!! When we first walked in there was no wait on a saturday afternoon around 2pm and parking in the garage was free. First off let me say this restaurant provided AMAZING 5 STAR service. I went to brunch with my sister and cousin and our waitor so so kind, attentive, and quick! I ordered the popular red velvet waffle with chicken and cheesy grits! The chicken was really good and seasoned I pretty much forgot about the waffle lol it was about $17.50 for my food alone kinda pricey. I liked the chicken I don't think I'll get the waffle again. But all of our food was good!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience, vibe, and the food. Enough said."}
{"text":"Coffee fantastic. The guys at the bar, Chris and Ian, are always cheerful and attentive. Breakfast is a must, my Mom just adores the strawberry waffles."}
{"text":"Their is nothing more that I can say about this place except GO there and try it. We were driving thru the Charlotte area and found this place. What a gem...I got the Red Velvet Waffle and it was simply divine. I also tried my sis's shrimp and grits and my niece's omelet was outstanding. I can't wait till I am back in NC again so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles I have ever had! The wait on a Saturday morning around 11am was only about 20 minutes. My friend and I ordered the mimosa special for $8 and it was delicious! I decided on the chicken and red velvet waffles. Making it red velvet was an added cost, but absolutely worth it! The chicken was boneless and tender, while the heavenly waffles also came with a cream cheese icing sauce. I can't wait to go back for brunch soon!"}
{"text":"Finally found a good breakfast place in Charlotte!  Came here for my birthday brunch a few weeks ago and all I have to say is that the Red Velved Waffle was pretty amazing! My boyfriend had an egg white omelet, which was pretty tasty and the French Press coffee was yummy too!  I cannot wait to come back and try the French Toast!"}
{"text":"Oh what good Breakfast food!  Great stop after the Saturday morning Farmer's market.  Or stop before the mall opens.  Did both this morning.  Breakfast casserole is my go to.  Unbelievable pancakes...dare you to finish the plate!  Great grits, omelets or just standard breakfast plate.  Wonderful wait staff too"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for brunch.  Ask what the homemade jam is that day and if it sounds like something you like, be sure to get toast!  Hashbrowns are phenomenal as well as the banana split parfait.  Caramel coffee cake is dangerously addictive."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed... We were hungry for breakfast and it got the job done but didn't deliver beyond that. Our server has a bit of a 'tude. But hey, we're fed and caffeinated. The coffe cake was really good if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I always get to Terrace when my family is visiting from Australia and it never disappoints. Now don't get me wrong I am just as happy being at waffle house when it comes to a hangover cure so I'm not a brunch snob but this is a great place to have a meal.  Only giving it 4 stars because the staff can be a little grumpy and I have had a few grumpy hostesses when I took my baby and stroller in. Otherwise the food is exceptional and the bloody Mary El Diablo is the best thing to happen to the bloody mary."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for breakfast and was I in for a surprise. If you are looking for some unique breakfast selections and a very nice atmosphere, check it out. It's a great addition to the South Park area.   I had a fine experience with our waiter, food was served quickly and as ordered. I tried the chocolate smore french toast. This plate is huge! Way more than a normal person could/should eat in one sitting. But, maybe a good idea to share. Or perhaps they offer a half size if you request it? I think I will try that next time. It is absolutely delicious by the way, especially if you are a french toast addict like myself. I am always going to restaurants and trying whatever unique french toast offering they have come up with. This one certainly did not disappoint. I also tried some of my husbands grits, and they were to die for."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The atmosphere was warm and the service was great! I will most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I had the red velvet waffle, fired chicken and fruit. I loved the cream cheese icing on the waffle. I didn't care for the fruit. On the down side, our waiter Seth was very dry and gave is a vibe he didn't want to be there. Poor service that day but greatttt food!"}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch last weekend with some friends. I've been to Charlotte many times before but never tried this place before but read good reviews about it! There's a parking deck right beside the restaurant which was very convenient. It was a 45 minute wait but the area the restaurant is in was very nice and it was a nice day outside so we decided to just walk around while we waited. After about forty minutes we got a call that our table was ready. The inside was very nice and quaint. There is an upstairs area that allows for more seating. I ended up getting the red velvet waffle with chicken and a side of fruit. Also I was stuck between getting the dueling mimosa and the regular mimosa. I asked the waitress and she told me the dueling mimosa really wasn't that great and recommended the sunshine mimosa so I ended up ordering that and it was great! Also my food was absolutely delectable!!! The chicken was boneless and very tender and well seasoned. The waffle was soft, light, and fluffy and the fruit was ripe and not too ripe! All in all, this place is a great brunch spot with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Tried it for family brunch while in town for a wedding, there was 35 min wait for tables but our group was 6 sat down in bar area right away. Ordered the famous red velvet waffles with fried chicken - waffle was soft but flavor was good (sweet) but the fried chicken batter was crispy, flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Subpar food...chicken and waffle, quiche...omelet and even simple eggs. Asked for over medium with sausage and fruit...they delivered runny eggs, bacon and no fruit.  The chicken and waffle was supposed to come with a side...I asked for grits and they never delivered.  We will not return."}
{"text":"This review is for dinner, two stars is generous. We were seated in a dark, small space upstairs even though it was empty. The service was slow and very immature. I had the crab bisque which tasted like water with flour, and the halibut which was massively overcooked, sandpaper dry and tasteless. Really bad, won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has great southern food with a modern twist. I absolutely would eat here again. Fair price points for all dishes. The smothered chicken is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. Red Velvet Waffles are to die for. Today I had the Turkey Omelet, I absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"food was great!!service suck!!our server didnt even refill our water until it was time for us to go.he had to send the bus boy to do it.we notice the whole hour we was there he was just to busy flirting with this two young ladies .we felt totally ignored the whole time we was there.yea great food but not worth going back is service suck!!food took about 20min and the cafe only had about 3 tables on a friday night!"}
{"text":"Gourmet breakfast, delicious and inexpensive. Excellent service in nice atmosphere and free parking."}
{"text":"Very nice place, lovely wait staff, great location. the place is pricey, but overall has good food and good atmosphere. its a tad chilly in there but rather be chilly than hot. our waitress was great, i asked to try a sauce before ordering the eggs benedict. which was good but not fantastic, the canadian bacon is good, i just was surprised how thick of slices they point on there. i could have used just one of them sliced in half, kinda overpowered the Benedict. cant wait to try something different next time, the shrimp and grits were amazing according to my mom. it comes with fried spears of okra on the top of the shrimp and grits. lovely place, will return."}
{"text":"After a long and treacherous New Year's Eve (picture being cut off at the bar below Gastro Lounge, and continuing to drink out of a Stella can tucked in my trenchcoat)-- well, yea. We needed breakfast recovery. So to Terrace Cafe we went.  The notorious \"wait\" ensued. We weren't the only hungover ones, and as the rain drizzled, we recanted the night before, before being seated 30 mins later.  We spotted about 6 open tables as we're led in, we wondered why we weren't seated earlier.  Ordered foamy cappuccinos, and fresh squeezed OJ. Started feeling the road to recovery.  The menu looked great. We wanted to order everything. But I stuck to something I've missed, poached eggs. We ordered:      Eggs Florentine.     Full breakfast, and     the Cajun Shrimp Omelet.  My eggs were perfectly poached, which made me happy. The Hollandaise sauce actually tasted like Hollandaise sauce. My English muffin however was a tad over fried and hard. Oh well. Overall tasty. Good salad. Good hash.  My friends dug their meals. The Cajun Shrimp was a bit too pungent of a thing to eat hungover (eggs and fishyness...) but seemed OK. Bit over the top onion-y.  Finished. Service was just OK.  Bit pricey, but the best hangover cure. Will come here again.

{"text":"As soon as I walked in I was awed by the amount of people on both levels. This is always a good sign. We were seated quickly (party of two). The waiter was very swift initially and quite friendly. I ordered the (house made) sausage egg and cheese buttermilk biscuit which came with a choice of hash browns, grits or fruit. I went with the hash browns. My cousin ordered the red velvet waffle with chicken - I should've ordered that! The biscuit itself was just ok and so was everything on and around it. I was thinking house-made sausage had to be something spectacular like Neese's... not so much. To be honest, Bojangles has a better patty. Of course I had to taste the chicken and waffles and the chicken was so tender and moist and the waffle was just sweet enough to not need any syrup but not so sweet that it caused a diabetic coma. As we were waiting for our food, I noticed the hostess walking with a half-empty plate of food ( I guess she was headed to the kitchen??) and she grabbed something from the plate and ate it! That threw me for a loop considering the ambiance given off by the restaurant. Other than that, I was pleased by the wait staff. One waiter who was not serving us even offered to check to see if our car was still on the street - apparently there are certain hours for parking on the street without being towed. Overall, I had a good experience and I will give it another try. I just know to avoid the basics and go for something more extravagant if I want some flavor."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast/lunch places in Charlotte! The chicken and waffles is like Heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"Delicious! OMG, the red velvet waffle was mind blowingly good! Everything is a la carte so I ordered a side of the inhouse made sausage... shut the front door! It was an explosion of flavor! I will be a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. First of all we drive 45 minutes just to eat here if that tells you anything. The food is amazing. They have a huge variety and the service is top notch. Super clean too. I think you can dine outside if you want but we never have. A must try for anyone who loves brunch and a vast gourmet menu!"}
{"text":"We just paid a $50 breakfast for two and were seated in the employee break-room AKA upper level left side, outside the server station. During our meal, up to 8 employees congregated in that space to take a break, eat, stand around socializing and prep food.  At one point, the manager dropped in too.  One suggestion: The owners/management need to build a separate employee break-room or avoid seating patrons in that area and train employees appropriate server etiquette when patrons are in view. Customer service 101."}
{"text":"Warning:  Do NOT go here for breakfast.  Dinner is okay but breakfast is probably not a good idea.  I have to say that their mochas are tasty (when they are hot)"}
{"text":"I hate writing negative commentary on local businesses, but I was really disappointed in how Terrace Cafe treated us at breakfast.    We are big groupon users, and I have NEVER had an institution think twice about fully honoring a *purchased* groupon just past its expiration date before now.  There is a first for everything I suppose ... this is just incredibly short-sighted.  The whole point of a groupon is to get someone to try something new, in hopes that they will become something of a recurring customer.  I regularly hold breakfast and lunch meetings in the South Charlotte restaurant scene, and thought Terrace Cafe might be a good place for such meetings.  But they have lost my business with this foolishness.  Incredibly frustrating.  The food itself was fine, though I think the hype has more to do with the nice ambience than particularly wonderful food.  I had the acclaimed red velvet waffle and found it ... okay.  Just okay.  It was dense (which makes sense for red velvet) and dry.  It certainly wasn't *bad,* but it just didn't come across as anything special among waffles.  Different?  Yes.  Delicious?  I wouldn;t go nearly that far.  My wife thought her eggs, biscuit and grits were done nicely.  And we both enjoyed our fru-fru coffees.  The presentation was attractive and the service was better than the somewhat mixed comments you read about this place, probably because we went on a Tuesday.  So overall it was good, but not the *amazing* we were hoping for.  (These are honest opinions on the food and experience, formed BEFORE the groupon nonsense occurred at the end of the meal.)  Honestly though ... if you're rating this place specifically on food is it meaningfully better than the nearby Original Pancake House?  Not based on what we tasted today.  Now the setting is in a difference league entirely ... but the food itself wasn't a special draw.  Given the OPH's standing as an excellent place for customer service and a good place to do business breakfasts, Terrace Cafe might be well served to think a little more broad-mindedly about how they treat their would-be customers."}
{"text":"I lived upstairs from Terrace Cafe in corporate housing for my first couple months in Charlotte. Since we were still settling down, we got take-out from Terrace Cafe a LOT. Here's how it went: Look for menu online.  Call in order.  Walk downstairs.  Get food.  NOSH.   Here are some of my faves:   -- NC Trout with tempura green beans (DROOL!  Fast food places should replace fries with tempura green beans!) in a pineapple soy burre blanc.  The trout is super flaky and fresh, and the burre blanc so sinfully rich, it could make a cardboard box taste good!  -- Pork Tenderloin with black eyed pea succotash and jalapeno jam.  Tender and well seasoned, and the succotash and jam give it a nice sweetness.   -- Vegetable Plate.  I know, sounds sissy, but it's delicious.  A potato side, a side of tempura green beans (see, there they are again!) baby carrots (with the little green stems attached, nice touch) and asparagus.  Trust me, you won't miss the meat.   -- Bibb Salad:  my favorite starter here.  Mandarin oranges, pears, Crasins and the kicker... fried goat cheese!  Add fried goat cheese to...oh yeah, that cardboard box, and again, a delicious dish.   -- Fried Green Tomatoes: served with pimento cheese.  \"Nuff said.   The reason why I don't give TC 5 stars, is I had some just OK experiences for breakfast and lunch.  (Please, don't hurt me, Terrace Cafe diehards!) The famed red velvet waffle and banana pecan french toast were just too sweet.  I'm going to get a CAVITY sweet.   The lunch I ordered was a vegetable soup with olives...and the turkey sandwich was just that.  A boring turkey sandwich.  (Olives I think is one of those foods either you like or don't like, and it should be indicated on the menu or by the server if something has olives or not.)   The service is always friendly and pretty on-point.  The ambiance too is inviting and warm-- both levels.    Don't forget to check out their deals-- like buy-one-dinner-get-the-second 50% off certain days of the week!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. I went in there once and the server was so unprofessional me and my friends didn't even see him other then when he took our order, the server serving at the table beside us had to go get us our drinks. Then when it was time for the tab the server charged me and my friend for the same tab, I called back twice to tell the manager what happened the first time he told me to wait second time I got out on hold then hung up on. If you are gonna eat here just get the food to go. Me and my friend both have bank account statements to prove that we were charged twice. The server that we wanted to tip didn't even get the tip that we left for him because the server messed up while charging the cards. I am a broke college student and now I am $67 short. That was going to go towards my water bill. Never again. The server should get fired, he started cussing right when he got to our table smh. HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! The fried green tomatoes with pimiento cheese is absolutely to die for! Also the omelet you make yourself is amazing with goat cheese!!"}
{"text":"The best brunch in Charlotte!  The red velvet waffles, berry split, fried green tomatoes, were beyond outstanding! Worth the 40 monwait!"}
{"text":"RED VELVET WAFFLES AND FRIED CHICKEN!!Wow wow wow wow wow! Simply amazing! Great food! Great atmosphere! I really enjoyed my meal! Thanks so much for the awesome service!!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best places to have a weekend brunch in Charlotte period. Rarely do you find this level of consistency in a food place without breaking the bank. Service is also great and their attention to your needs is . One thing to keep in mind, this place is popular so expect some wait, but I suggest you do, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for breakfast brunch. Try the Red Velvet Waffle!"}
{"text":"The location was a little out there but it was our first time we went there and it was amazing food! We had the omlett with pancakes and both dishes were incredible! The service was also quick and friendly which made us definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Shrimp n grits!!!! WOW was this food excellent......great service, and the Piedmont center is beautiful. Such a refreshing change from Chicago. This was walking distance from my hotel, the Renaissance. The coffee was excellent as well; I tasted a salted carmel latte. The cafe menu is extensive, and the food menu had a good variety.  I also tasted the filet medallions and eggs meal, the steak was cooked perfectly and was tender. My shrimp and grits was the highlight, however. I got the sauce on the side (I do not like very spicy food, and that BBQ sauce WAS spicy), and it was perfect. The chorizo and fried okra were delicious in it. Such an innovative dish.  Next time I am in Charlotte, I will return!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! I had the Steak and eggs entree with hashbrowns.. Great food quality.. Definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Terrace while visiting Charlotte and really enjoyed it. I liked the ambience and feel of the restaurant. My honey had the shrimp and grits with a mule and I had the crab cake benedict with a cranberry mimosa. The wait wasn't too bad considering it was a Saturday afternoon. However, I will add the young hostess should be a bit more attentive as they check in and seat guest. Two couples that arrived after us were seated before us and the buzzer they provided didn't go off. All in all, I'd still return."}
{"text":"First of all their food is slightly better than adequate.  Called the day before spoke with the Manager who told us to come in with our party of 15 and they would make sure we sat together.  Showed up waited for all 15 people to make it, when they did not show we ask for a table for 10.  They split us into two booths.  The whole idea was a get together.  The managers response was \"what do you want me to do\", nuff said.  When a manager of a restaurant says that the other obvious problems become much worse.  The 4 hostesses never smiled welcomed us or said goodbye or thank you.  The waiter had a lon gotee that everyone was afraid would fall in our food.  He never smiled and never said thankyou.  If semi-good food with real bad service is what you want I recommend this restaurant.  The owner needs to hire workers that smile and thank the customer who pays their wages."}
{"text":"Had the famous red velvet waffles and chicken with fruit salad. It was delicious and the fruit was fresh. Absolutely no complaints.  Meant to review last time I went, this was actually my third time going and I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great experience. I tried the red velvet waffles and fried chicken. The waffle isn't extremely street and the cream cheese sauce was a great compliment because it wasn't too sweet as well. the fried chicken is a thin breast and not a wing. The staff was very courteous and patience. I will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"Lunch Spot when in South Park!  I was eager to try the Terrace Cafe having gone to school with the guy who now owns it and Ive been promising to try it.  I took my grandmother to lunch there on a Thursday around 12pm and walked right in. The front door staff seemed a bit distant and robotic, but walked us to the table up the stairs. We sat overlooking the first level and were approached by our bright and friendly server, Vivian.  We looked over the VAST menu and teetered between lunch and breakfast. Both looked Great.  We chose lunch. Granny ordered the Hawaiian Chicken Salad-Salad and I ordered the Mighty Corned Beef. Both were of good size when they arrived. Granny's salad was a Large scoop of delicious, Pineapple-laden creamy chicken salad that was Super fresh and light, over top of crisp mesclun greens. I wasn't sure what the dressing was, but it was sent on the side (love that) and granny didn't even use it.  My Mighty Corned Beef was just that! A beautiful sandwich of HOT Corned Beef, Chef's Slaw, Russian dressing, on perfectly toasted Marble Rye. Served with Thick Cut Steak Fries, this was a MEAL to write about (that's why I'm doing it). Although we were full, the dessert tray (nothing beats a tray) was brought over. The dessert portion sizes were great, small enough to have a few bits if sharing, and large enough to not feel ripped off! We shared the Blondie and it came out HOT, with a perfect scoop of vanilla and flavorful.  Service was perfect, food came out fast, drinks stayed full, it was overall a wonderful time."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite restaurants to eat brunch. The food and service is excellent here. The only downside is they don't take reservations and the wait is really long so make sure to get there early."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant while on vacation in NC. I had the Shrimp & Grits and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!! It was spicy, but the creamy grits cooled off my mouth! I couldn't get enough of it!! I would recommend this place to anyone and the next time I am in Charlotte, I will be visiting this restaurant. It was fabulous!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last Saturday night. Couldn't decide what we wanted to eat and saw an add for them in Southpark magazine. Oh what the heck.. The place is rather unassuming from the outside. We arrived at around 6:30, and I would say around 40% full. The wait staff is very friendly. The first thing that grabbed my eye, was their wine list. The prices are very competitve! We had a nice bottle of pinot for $38! I saw an Italian wine on the menu that I paid $130 2 weeeks ago, and it was going for $75. On to the food,,, the menu was quite good and the thing that impresses is that all the food is organic and humane. Big plus! I had a chicken dish that was very tasty. My wife had a tender loin with a jalepeno sauce that was just right and not overpowering. I enjoyed our dining experience and would return definetely! A couple of things,,, lights are a little bright for dinner and they need some type of background music. The atmosphere was some what generic. They have a big breakfast and lunch crowd, so will be curious how they will compete in Piedmont Row(especially with George's opening up)"}
{"text":"Went again yesterday and again it was excellent.  Still high quality, consistent, good service, everything you could ask.  I had the steak salad, wife had breakfast, daughter had banana pancakes, all great.  Consistency counts."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times I had excellent lattes. I've also had both the red velvet and lemon poppyseed waffles. Both were phenomenal. Good service, too."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with three other people.  I ordered the closest thing to regular Eggs Benedict (EB) I could find, and paired it with Earl Grey tea. The EB was miserable. EB is a classic dish for a reason. There is no benefit in trying to switch it up. The hollandaise was made with whole grain mustard, which destroyed the best part of the dish. The meat disks were about the diameter of a golf ball, and I don't even remember what the bread/English muffin was like.  Our server was a bit lukewarm, and, once things got super busy, the amount of time between visits to our table became way too long. Table mates sat without beverage refills for a while.   The space is pretty nice. It's bright and clean, but I could have certainly done without all the religious paraphernalia and signage at the host stand. If I wanted to deal with that, I'd go to a pancake breakfast at a local church. Couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday brunch with family. The food is pretty good. It was very packed but the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"My husband and myself with another couple came here this past Sunday for brunch. Very delicious and nice experience.  When we walked in, they had a 15 minute wait, which is not too bad for a Sunday brunch time. We were seated quickly and placed our order for drinks. The guys got French Press coffee. Only snafu of the day. Even after sitting for 5 minutes the french press coffee was the color of tea and had no coffee flavor. The waitress said there was new bar staff that day and they had been messing up drink orders all morning. Fortunately she switched it out for regular coffee for them.   My husband and I ordered an omelet with chorizo, salsa, and goat cheese with hashbrowns and a side order of biscuits and gravy. Our friends order the hash scramble of the day and a chicken and egg biscuit. The omelet was fantastic!! I also appreciated that they gave us some type of jam for the bread. It seemed and tasted homemade to me. The biscuits and gravy were definitely the winner though! Our friends even ordered one when they saw ours. Super delish!  Overall fantastic service and meal."}
{"text":"I am not much of a breakfast person, but this place was great.  It is a bit pricey for breakfast but worth it.  The red velvet waffle is to die for, and the grits were the best I have ever had.  Definitely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"After landing in Charlotte, all I wanted were some good grits and brunch. Terrace Cafe was a wise, wise choice!  Kenzie K. and I were here on a Saturday morning, with a 45 minute wait. Clearly, everyone else in Charlotte loves brunch a much as we do. Luckily, there's a nice little waiting area outside and you can also order some coffee or drinks from the bar while you're waiting.   Now, I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to benedicts, but the Sausage Eggs Benedict (eggs, sausage, and Hollandaise on a biscuit) with cheese grits was beyond tasty. We also got the Fried Oyster Salad (it's a salad so it's definitely healthy, right?) Overall, great food and I wish I was able to try more of the menu when I was here!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best brunch place in Charlotte. They offer a wide variety of menu items and everything I have tried is outstanding. My favorites are the biscuits and gravy, red velvet waffle, egg casserole, and usually any hash special they have. The Bavarian cream stuffed French toast is all out of this world, though it is extremely rich. The red velvet waffle is very unique and delicious. It is perfect even for those who don't like super sweet, the cream cheese frosting drizzle adds enough sweetness to not need syrup but doesn't over do it. Really you can't go wrong with anything here. Drinks are great too! Service can be slow on occasion and there is always a wait, but in my opinion the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Easy walking distance from the Renaissance Southpark hotel. Healthy beakfast selections look tasty as well.  The food was good, even superb but $42 (before the tip) for breakfast?  WTF?  Was here with the GF on a quick trip to Charlotte.  Granted, this is in the South Park area which is quite trendy and upscale but still, 42 bucks for omelettes, juice, coffee and pancakes...helllllllll no.  Won't be coming back here unless it's on the company dime."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for breakfast. We were seated immediately when we walked in at around 9 am, but it was definitely much busier when we left at around 10 am. Their benedict was okay. Poached eggs were slightly overcooked. Side of grits was very bland. The kid's pancakes were in the shape of animals, which is cute but they were also small. My favorite thing that I ordered was their white mocha. I could drink that every morning."}
{"text":"I hate going out for breakfast because I don't eat eggs, but this restaurant has changed that!  Lemon Poppyseed Waffles... so good!"}
{"text":"RUDE, RUDE AND RUDE!!!!  Seamed it was an inconvenience for them to even seat our party."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for Sunday brunch. The menu has a lot of options. Shrimp and grits is too good. Their red velvet waffle is excellent!! Orange juice is really fresh squeezed OJ!"}
{"text":"Terrace is great! I work very close and love to walk over for coffee or a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich some mornings. Its always very fast and the service is great. I have also been to numerous lunches there and have never had a bad meal. Highly reccommend if you are in the Southpark area for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Average breakfast fare...had pancakes, eggs, hash browns, and ham. Nothing special..."}
{"text":"This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" takes us to the Terrace Café located in the Piedmont Town Center in the heart of SouthPark. This multi-use Town Center features shops, restaurants, offices, and residential properties arranged in a walkable community.  We arrived at 12:10 on a Saturday to a 75 minute wait. Honestly, we debated leaving but decided to wait and that was a great decision because it turned into a manageable 40 minutes. We had a great view of the industrial style loft area and the charm that comes with this type of structure.   Terrace Café offers a wide variety of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. While waiting, we noticed that most of the dishes coming out of the kitchen were breakfast. Although they looked appetizing, we opted for lunch.  We started with an appetizer of Fried Green Tomatoes served with a warm pimento cheese dip.   The Fried Green Tomatoes arrived quickly and were crispy outside and tender inside with a slight vinegary taste. They were great. Even my wife, who really doesn't like tomatoes, enjoyed them. I think they could serve the cheese dip on anything and it would be great.  I ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken tossed in hot sauce and served over braised collard greens and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was outstanding, crispy and tender, but the mashed potatoes took the prize as the best component of this dish. They were light and creamy with just enough lumps to let you know they were freshly made. The collard greens were a combination of sweet and vinegary, and tasted great. The portions were huge, and definitely not for someone who doesn't like heat as the Nashville hot sauce lived up to its name. Dora here. Definitely a \"forehead slicker.\" lol.  My wife ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant, a Hawaiian version of chicken salad on a fresh croissant served with lettuce and tomato and sweet potato waffle fries.   The chicken salad, made with cream cheese instead of the normal mayo, included grapes, pineapple, pecans, and mandarin oranges. The sweet potatoes waffle fries were a first for us, but something we'd definitely order again.  I finished off my meal with a Peanut Butter Cup Latte and my wife chose the Tiramisu Latte. Both were excellent and a great way to cap off our meal. Dora here. Lip-smacking yummy!  Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for someone looking for a unique restaurant offering exceptional food. I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. The restaurant was reviewed by Food Blogger Ernie Hiers. For other reviews see dorahiers.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"Food was good and atmosphere was good.  And apparently Friday night was $5 glass of wine night!   I am already predisposed to love any place with breakfast all day anyway but the menu was a good mix of other options as well.  I had the red velvet waffles with chicken. Yeah pretty awesome. My wife had the strange-sounding but delicious crab cake BLT.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to everyone! They close their breakfast and brunch at 2:30 (which is a bummer) and reopen later for dinner. I love everything on their menu but some of my all time favorites is shimp & gritz, fillet Benedict, salmon Asian salad, crab cake blt and the red velvet waffle. Their servers are just the sweetest!"}
{"text":"Last weekend me and a few friends went here for brunch, visiting out of town. The atmosphere was amazing I didn't feel like unwanted there, the managers really helped out the servers there as well. Very nice place for brunch and it isn't expensive .. I will be back"}
{"text":"I have now been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and all 3 were amazing.  At breakfast, my party all tried a bit of everything...one dish was better than the next.  The pancakes were the best I have had in any restaurant in years and the quiche is beyond description.  No doubt why this place was voted best breakfast in Charlotte. At lunch, my dad had salmon with steamed veggies, which was a genorous  and very tasty lunch portion, and I had the hummus appetizer and grilled cheese.  If you enjoy hummus, this one is not to be missed.  Portion size was LARGE and hummus was delightful.  At dinner, we ordered from the Valentines price fixe menu; we each had crab bisque, filet mignon, lobster and dessert; all were exceptional.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed....TRY TERRACE CAFE!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes. Strike 1: After waiting for 45 minutes we asked the hostess where we were in line and she told us we were next, yet we were not called next and got completely skipped over for an incomplete party when there is clearly a sign at the front that says they don't sit incomplete parties! Strike 2: they didn't have silverware, coke, sweet tea, clean dishes, nor did they have clean glasses. Strike 3: the food was completely flavorless. Not quite sure why people eat here. Our server was overwhelmed with other tables and barely even spoke to us. I think the only thing I enjoyed was my glass of water and my walk out of the door!  Update in response to the owner: A busy restaurant explains the lack of supplies but being skipped over in line is complete incompetence by the hostess and the other staff members up front. And the other party was still taken to their table despite us calling the hostess out on her error prior to them being seated."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try their red velvet waffle because waffle is one of my absolute favorite food. What a disappointment. It just tasted so plain and normal to me. I don't think it tasted any different than any other place. We may try it again sometime but we were definitely not impressed the first time."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, waiter was on point. Clean restaurant, with nice decor. Very friendly atmosphere..."}
{"text":"The food was just meh. The \"atmosphere\" relatively non-existent. It does appear to be a very family friendly place, so I guess that's a plus. I ordered the veggie omelette, added cheese, subbed grits & a biscuit. The dish was intended to be healthy, but I did my best to change that. Unfortunately the food was just incredibly bland. It was disappointing, especially because of the cost. If you're going on a weekend, get there early, it gets packed. I don't think I'll be back though."}
{"text":"I went here specifically for the red velvet waffle. Sad to say I wasn't impressed. It was just red. No coco flavor or anything that resembled red velvet cake. It was a well prepard waffle although. I would go back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Other than some over salted spinach, both our meals (Dijon chicken & chicken and waffles) were awesome. The whole menu looks fantastic and I can't wait to try other menu items. Service was impeccable, and the ambiance was very nice. It's too bad there is no outdoor seating it would perfect on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"So, I feel bad submitting this review but I'm doing it anyway. I'm in Charlotte often and Terrace used to be my go-to breakfast spot. Two previous visits I went to the Ballantine location and was so disappointed. Went to the Piedmont location this time and was disappointed as well.  3 strikes: your out! Table not cleaned well, server was less than welcoming, had to ask for silverware after food was served. Quality of food has declined sharply. Same tempting recipes in a nice atmosphere but my food was so heavy on the cooking grease (Chef's daily special Hash) that's really all I tasted, daughters poppyseed French toast was burnt on one side, sons eggs were cold; asked for over easy on 2 eggs, 1 yoke was broken and cooked hard and other yoke was in tacked but pretty much hard too. Regular coffee was barely warm, and cup came with lipstick stain from previous user. Second cup of coffee I ordered, decaf this time, was same low temp. The bill was a steep $125.00 for 6 of us and honestly IHOP would of (& has) done a better job for much less  $$.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has really good food, but not enough selection in my opinion. I came for brunch and was expecting to be wow'd however the waitstaff was a few fries short of a happy meal, if you know what I mean. Go for the food but disregard the service. I recommend it but would not come frequently."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! We went for my birthday and the waiter was awesome and attentive. Both locations have consistently good food. Only thing I would recommend is a little more seasoning on the grits. Everything else was flavorful!!"}
{"text":"So sad. This location is excellent. The food is above average. The decor is lovely. The service...ugh. Why? Why? Why? It's so easy to fix?!? SMILE a little!! Even my teen-age sons said that our server didn't look like he enjoyed his job very much. Couldn't get refills on coffee to save my life. I admit, it was brunch...so coffee is a crazy request! He really missed out too. I'm a 50% tipper if the service is at least fair - as I understand everyone has a bad day. But NOBODY was smiling. Everyone looked miserable. And if your servers are miserable, that means your management is miserable. And if your management is miserable, than I certainly don't want to add to the funds of an owner that makes people miserable. Will give it another go, as I try to give everyone a 2nd chance, have even experienced a couple of turn-arounds...but man - it could be such a warm, successful, happy place...{sigh}"}
{"text":"I'm very confused how this restaurant has positive reviews. We just finished our third (and hopefully last) time eating here, and every experience has been disappointing.  From mediocre service to poor quality food, this restaurant is a miss."}
{"text":"I love brunch! But I don't go often because I hate the wait. Fortunately, I was hanging with friends one weekend in Charlotte, so I feeling particularly patience. My patience paid off, because the food here is awesome. First, I'll comment on the atmosphere. The Terrace Cafe is decorated to look Italian, which threw me off a little because then I was expecting Mediterranean food, but I felt warm and comfortable here. They could have a little more seating for those of us waiting, but the wait wasn't really that bad. When we did sit down, we ordered mimosas, and they came pretty quickly. I got the waffle with strawberries on the top and I was oh so happy. My friend ordered a shrimp omelette, and I was jealous because it was so good. Next time I come, I'm getting that omelette! With a waffle on the side."}
{"text":"Has Potential  The Terrace Cafe in South Park has a good foundation going but could use a little polish. The inside is decorated tastefully and the restaurant itself was clean. The waitstaff was very nice but it was slow considering the fact that it was a Thursday and the restaurant was somewhat empty. I ordered the Bavarian Stuffed French Toast Sticks, while the flavors and spices were delicious and it was cooked very well, there was very little cream inside the toast itself and only stuffed on one side. One out of the three sticks didn't have any cream in them at ALL. Second, I also tried the house made sausage which flavor-wise was amazing! But they were extremely over cooked and very very dry. My friend ordered the Red Velvet Waffles which I had a bite of, they were very good and well cooked so no real problem on that end. Has potential but could use a bit of polish around the corners."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! How can you dislike a place that has bacon bloody Mary's and red velvet waffles? Everyone is so friendly and outgoing. I wish I had the time to eat here every week!"}
{"text":"my husband and I came here on a saturday at about 12:45 and it was packed! we waited for about 45 minutes and were then seated. We started with the fried green tomatoes but when they arrived we had no silverware, then when we got silverware the fork was dirty. the tomatoes were okay. hubby loved them though. We got the eggs benedict, hash browns, cheese grits, and red velvet waffle. I wasn't a fan of any of the savory items and I usually like eggs benedict. Again, my husband loved it though. The red velvet waffle was the only thing that wasn't just below 'okay', it was delicious! If you like red velvet it's a must have. and it surprisingly wasn't as heavy as i expected it to be, it was perfect. I'll be back just for that and to give the other menu items a try"}
{"text":"We arrived at Terrace Cafe on Sunday around 1pm, that might be where we went wrong.  My expectations were high after reading all the reviews online, but we did not seem to have a great food experience.  The BEC (Bacon, Egg and Cheese Biscuit) I ordered was decent at best - the biscuit was rock hard.  I took the top off and ate the bacon, egg and cheese open faced, luckily they were all good.    We also ordered the California French Toast (orange flavored french toast).  The only orange flavor was the mandarin oranges in my fruit cup.  The cranberry orange butter was good, and the toast was cooked very well - thick toast, a little overcooked, but there just wasn't much flavor.    We also had the Breakfast Casserole which was good.  The menu said it had a pastry bottom, but the bottom of ours was just the eggs, no pastry bottom.    Great service.  Maybe we just came too late or on a bad day, but the food was just not that impressive.  For more on this review check out: http://hungrytotravel.wordpress.com"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing! Specifically the big breakfast... The only thing odd here is the parking situation but the service has been great the few times I've been here the atmosphere is great even though it is rather tiny in size but don't let that fool you"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars as our experience was not good.  We arrived early on Sunday so there was no wait. Our waitress came over quickly for our drink orders and then disappeared for about 15 minutes after giving us our drinks. We did not receive refills our entire meal. By the time we received our food it was cold. The red velvet waffle is overrated but it probably would have been better if it were hot.  Our waitress never came over to check on us or to ask how we were. We had to ask another waiter for ketchup.   We ended up waiting for our check and when we tried to get her attention, she blatantly ignored us. I would not return to this restaurant and I am glad we didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is mediocre at best for dinner.  I have to assume the good reviews are based off a breakfast experience because our first time dinner experience was blah across the board.  It felt and tasted like an upscale cafeteria experience... not good."}
{"text":"Great time with friends and food was good. Could tell it was a new cook... Things were on the overly cooked side this visit but still one of my favorite spots of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went for a walk to find dinner and happened upon the Terrace Cafe`, Ian C assisted me with some suggestions and I asked which would hold up as I walked back to my room. Ian offered the chicken strips. He was very friendly and courteous.   When I opened my container I found enough food for two! It was very good and more than I could eat. I hope to return for breakfast and would recommend anyone to try the place tucked around the corner from all of the other more fancier restaurants."}
{"text":"I had a feeling from their menu that Terrace would be a winner and I was right. We showed up at 10am on a Saturday as a party of 2 and waited about 20 minutes. Our waitress was bubbly and very attentive. The food was a bit slow but nothing egregious and she was very apologetic. We had carrot cake pancakes, a veggie omelet, and a side of chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes are so fluffy! A great spot."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times that Yelp steered me wrong.  We stopped for lunch today prior to a nearby doctor's appointment and ordered the Angus Burger along with the Creole Filet Medallions.  I should have said something immediately when the latter arrived, as the meat was most certainly not filet.  I think it was sirloin.  It also was not medallions, as it wasn't a round cut, the sirloin was simply cut in half.  My companion said that the burger did not seem to have the taste or texture you would expect of Angus meat either, while the fries were too heavily salted.  The service was fine but having sirloin passed off as filet is pretty inexcusable."}
{"text":"I heard about Terrace Cafe not from Yelp or friends in Charlotte but from a friend in Texas and my sister in Indianapolis. When both of them mentioned Terrace Cafe's Red Velvet Waffle, I knew a meeting with said waffle would be in my future.   And today was that day. When I rolled up to Terrace Cafe, it was right before the churchie crowd and for some reason, I was expecting them to have a huge patio but no dice--just an inside dining area with an upstairs and downstairs.   I shouldn't have even looked at the menu but did against my better judgment and started to feel conflicted. I've been wanting that damn red velvet waffle for the past few months but then I started to see other tasty items like S'more french toast, a variety of eggs Benedict, etc but stuck to my guns and got the waffle.   It was everything I dreamed of and more. And from fear of going into sugar shock, I finished 3/4 of it and threw in the towel.   I had a skim latte which was smooth and light and priced the same as a Starbucks latte. The french press wasn't too shabby either. Service was fantastic and right on point. I definitely recommend this place for brunch--be sure to get there early though--they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"STOP, PUSH THE DIRECTIONS BUTTON, DRIVE HERE NOW!  This is a breakfast experience not to be missed. I think I might throw a tent up and stay here for a while and try all their items for the next several days. I ordered the banana/pecan waffles. They were amazing! They were perfectly prepared, fluffy, not doughey, flavorful and not too sweet - definitely gourmet. The menu is diverse with options to satisfy even the pickiest eater. Service was prompt and courteous. Cafe Au Lait was perfect. Can't say enough about this restaurant. We will come here every time we visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review about the other location, but I had to come back and write a review about this location as we were there just this past weekend per a request of my sister and brother in law when they came to visit.  My sister ordered the red velvet waffle, good as always.  My brother in law ordered Eggs benedict and a side of the biscuits and gravy.  Their gravy is one of the bests that I have ever had, I will have to remember to get a side of that in the future!  Kevin has some pork quiche.  I liked this much better than the quiche that I had last time at the other location.  This one was cooked better and just had a much better flavor.  Fantastic!  I had the special waffle - it was a cinnamon bun waffle.  It was the best waffle that I have had, and I really wish they would put this on their regular menu, it is fabulous!    My only complaint was that it took awhile for us to get seated, but food was fast and excellent!"}
{"text":"We came a little after 1 on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was pretty full but we got a table right away. Despite how busy the place was there was kind of a calm ambiance, which my hubs attributed to strategic not-so-bright lighting and color scheme.  It feels like a nice place.  The sanitation rating inspired confidence too. I got a strawberry waffle with sausage, he got the quiche of the day (ham, cheese, broc and tomato).  My waffle was tasty, but then again, most waffles are.  The sausage patties had a little zing to them.  Hubs' quiche was promising but seemed to have been sitting for a little too long.  He said my quiches are better - to which you might say, of course he did, but he's more the type to say \"hon, you've got to learn how to make this\" if that is more true to the situation.  They had other items that looked interesting - crab benedict, for example, and some of their breakfast sandwiches - but between us we were neither wowed nor wigged out. The place is neither a deal nor highway robbery.  Overall it's kind of average."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is a gem.  Everything was fresh & delicious.  The staff was professional & friendly.  We will absolutely be back many times."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot!  The service was great and sooo nice. Loved my egg white turkey omelette! And the banana pecan pancake was really yummy. Their biscuits are a must too."}
{"text":"I came here to visit family and they suggested this place. Long wait, but the service was fantastic. I ordered a hot chocolate that was absolutely delicious. Food was good but there was quite the wait for it. They almost forgot my soup appetizer, but apologized for the wait. A different daily drink every day; since we came on a Monday we had mimosas. They are famous for their red velvet waffles, but their lemon and poppy seed French toast is amazing!"}
{"text":"We stopped in a for quick work lunch.  The service was prompt.  Even at 11:30 there was a good number of people already there which was a good sign.  The food was pretty good.  We had a variety of dishes.  My coworker really liked the shrimp and grits while my fried chicken sandwich was pretty good.  If you are in the area this could be a solid option."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Wednesday evening at 6:30.  Me and my friend were a bit surprised to find that when we arrived we were the only people in the restaurant but this resulted in extra attention from our server. We started with the fried green tomatoes which were pretty good but not amazing. Then for our entrees I got the chicken and waffles and my friend got the shrimp and grits.  I've had some good chicken and waffles and although these did not quite reach the spectacular level it was still delicious enough that I would go back to get it again!"}
{"text":"I go to the Ballentyne location all the time, and my food is always great. However, I have had several bad meals at this location. I stopped by for lunch, and waited 15 minutes before someone came over to greet me. I then waited over 30 minutes for my food to come out. The waitress kept saying that it wasn't ready yet. When it finally came out, it was not only overcooked but it was ice cold. There was also some sort of orange sauce splatted on my plate from someone else's meal. It was gross. Obviously, it had been sitting there for a long time. I didn't have another 30 minutes to wait for them to remake the food , I just wont be returning. This isn't the first time I've received cold food here."}
{"text":"This is the one place I like to bring out of town guest. It never disappoints. Customer service is generally good but today our servers seemed preoccupied but the he food is always delicious. Today I was freezing in here since I forgot my jacket, but everything else was exceptional! My favorite breakfast place in Charlotte!!! The red velvet waffles is delicious, I always get extra drizzle, but I generally don't use syrup because I'm not a fan of super sweet!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning about 10. Got one of the last empty seats. When we came out there was a crowd waiting.   Food was good. Ordered the crispy chicken biscuit. It has some heat to it. The hashbrowns were ok. Nothing special. My husband really enjoyed his red velvet waffle. And my parents enjoyed their omelets.   The waiter left something to be desired. No personality. Made weird comments and never checked on us once the food was delivered. My husband didn't get his side of hasbrowns until after he had finished his waffle and we all needed refills.   The water also has a weird taste."}
{"text":"I visited Terrace Cafe with a friend while on an extended layover in CLT (it's only about 15-20 mins from the airport). The restaurant was a tad difficult to find, as it was tucked into a complex of office buildings interspersed with other restaurants among the buildings and courtyards. Anyway, parking was simple and free in the neighboring garage, so that made life easier.  The restaurant interior is fairly roomy. It's a large loft-like space with extremely high ceilings. It almost felt like there was a lot of wastage of space in the setup, but it worked if loft-like is what they were going for. Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a more intimate ambiance.  The food was good...and unique breakfast selections! Normally you get the usual breakfast options, but Terrace Cafe has some interesting versions and flavors of pancakes and french toast and waffles and the like. They also have a variety of omelettes, among other breakfast choices.   My friend and I ordered the banana pecan french toast, the egg white veggie omelette, and a side of hash browns to share. The banana pecan french toast was interesting. They literally took banana bread and lightly coated it in french toast batter. It was good, but a little TOO sweet. Perhaps one of the other many french toast flavors would've been more suitable. The veggie omelette was great. Very healthy, not overly oily, and perfectly done. The hashbrowns were tasty and very crispy.  I'd recommend this place as a breakfast place to anyone visiting the Charlotte area. I really liked the variety and unique flavors of breakfast foods available."}
{"text":"Wow, less than impressed here! Placed a to-go order on the phone for mushroom crostini, shrimp po boy with no side and sweet tea. Showed up, was told to check with the bar. Bartender gave me unsweetened tea, had to ask for sweet and lemons. Got the sweet tea, had to ask again for lemons. And a straw. Didn't check the bag as I had to get back to training. Yummy smells had me digging into the bag in the car, only to discover no napkins and no utensils. Got back to training to eat, mushroom crostini was literally amazing, best thing about this whole experience! The po boy on the other hand sucked! 5 whole shrimp, no tarter sauce despite it being listed on the menu, very stale roll, slimy arugula and soggy fries."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best brunch I've had. I got the Lemon Poppy Seed French Toast and it was like eating lemon cake it was sooo good. Only items I didn't enjoy was the Turkey Bacon, it was too dry.   My girls friends each had waffles and chicken and no complaints from anyone! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I went here with my son for dinner one Wednesday night. I wasn't very hungry so I asked the waitress if I could have a waffle only (not wanting the 2 fried chicken breasts with the Chicken & Waffles). She said that wasn't a problem. Well, when she delivered the bill I was charged $17 for the waffle.  I reminded her I only got the waffle and I thought the price should be adjusted. She told me they didn't have time to \"customize orders\". The manager wouldn't take the time to come over and address the issue either. It was a very slow night in there (so he couldn't use the excuse he was too busy). There were only 2 other tables with customers in the  restaurant.   I will never go back here because my compliant was not addressed. The waitress couldn't even comprehend what I was telling her and the manager didn't want to be bothered."}
{"text":"10/17/15 Me: I need a Saturday brunch spot that kicks butt.  My friends and coworkers: You must go to Terrace Cafe!  Me: Well Ok!  Brunch is my favorite meal. I've been spoiled by all you can eat, everything included brunches...thanks DC :) so it's hard to find anything comparable to that experience in another city. I went ahead and decided to give Terrace Cafe a shot since it was so highly recommended by my friends and coworkers.   We arrived around noon and were seated within ten minutes of arrival. I put my name on the waitlist while my friend parked the car. Our table was ready before she entered the restaurant; the waitress stated that all party members, even though it was just two of us, need to be present before being seated. Luckily, my friend stepped in the door a few minutes after the news so this requirement didn't pose a problem for the beginning of our dining experience.  Our drink order was taken and we were given a few minutes to look over the menu. I asked the waitress for her recommendations, she told me two of her favorites but really didn't sell me on either as her recommendations were short, sweet, and lacked detail.  I was a bit surprised by the lack of information and decided to go with what looked good to me :).   My go to breakfast is French Toast, eggs, sausage or bacon, and hashbrowns.  Here the French toast stands alone as a menu item...bacon, eggs, etc are ala carte. This one little detail definitely influenced my final decision. I went with the Full Breakfast (Two eggs over easy, chicken apple sausage , cheese grits, and  substituted one slice of French toast for the two pancakes). Oh yeah, they have strict guidelines for substitutions and there is a charge to swap the pancakes for the French Toast. The French Toast was dense and lacked flavor. I saw what looked like cinnamon and maybe nutmeg sprinkled atop the bread but definitely did not taste it. The chicken apple sausage was delicious; I would definitely order that again. Finally, the eggs over easy and cheese grits were the most well prepared breakfast items for today's visit. Based on recommendations from trusted sources, I was expecting a better breakfast experience. I hope that my next visit will be more eventful."}
{"text":"There aren't as many great places to eat in Charlotte, so the few that taste exceptionally good, are usually busier than the rest.   The Terrace Cafe gets super packed during the weekend brunch service rush, so get ready for a bit of a wait.  PROTIP: The tables in the front near the bar, in the waiting area are first-come-first-served; so if you want to avoid an hour plus wait, snag one of those seats.  Onto the star of the show: the food is pretty solid here. The red velvet waffle was delicious and would highly recommend adding the fried chicken to that order. Otherwise, the food is very much brunch-like foods.   The service was spot-on and we didn't have to wait very long for help. The coffee here is superb as well and tasty.  Pros: great food for Charlotte Cons: the wait during the weekend is absurd"}
{"text":"All I should have to say is...S'mores French Toast!!! But, then this wouldn't be a review!!   We ventured in for a late lunch a while back it wasn't very busy with just a few tables in there. I had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich it was ok nothing that really stood out to be bad but not that good either.  I forget what my boss ordered I know it was a special, but he didn't care for it. My sister had the Quiche it was ice cold and then had to sit there with nothing to eat because the server wasn't around...when he did come over he ran to the kitchen to get it fixed she said it was of course much better!!   Now the real reason this place is getting 3 stars is because of the S'mores French Toast that we decided to have for dessert!!! OMG this was ridiculously good!! I highly recommend it not for your entrée but to share with others as a dessert because it is huge and sweet!!"}
{"text":"Best food for breakfast! I love their coffee and I've tried many different breakfasts and loved them all. The staff is great with service and very friendly. The wait is never too long either."}
{"text":"Food: I had the red velvet waffle, grits and biscuit & gravy.  The red velvet waffle is soft and not the crispy kind that you may get at some restaurant. On top of the waffle, they add white chocolate sauce and strawberry. Overall, it's pretty tasty. It's probably my fav thing here this far.   Grits is pretty blend. There's not enough seasoning on it. I may ask to upgrade to cheesy grits next time.  Biscuit and gravy: the biscuit is crispier than I would like. It's not those soft and fluffy kind. The gravy is pretty good. It has real chuck of ground beef not bitty tiny piece of ground beef which I can appreciate.   Customer service: the wait time is about 30 mins when we got here this morning. They promptly let us know when the table is ready. Our waitress is really attentive. The food came out in 10 mins. We are pretty happy with the service.   Location: The place is easy to find and free parking is right next to the building."}
{"text":"Great brunch! Gourmet waffles, French toast, pancakes, and wonderful service. Will surely become a must-have for us!"}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is a nice hip place for Brunch. We came on a Sunday morning and had no wait but it filled up quickly. We had two versions of their eggs benedict. The service was attentive and quick. Halfway through my Crab Cake Benedict I noticed an accumulating burnt flavor from the burn on the english muffins. I had already eaten half and it wasn't so noticeable that I didn't send it back. Otherwise I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely amazing food, probably one of the best overall restaurants I've been to in Charlotte.  My last visit I had the special Jambalaya, which was amazing. There was plenty of shrimp, the grits were cooked perfectly and the onion peels were a really nice touch.  The shrimp and grits are also great, however the Tuna is probably the best thing on the menu. The kale & cranberry salad complements the tuna perfectly.  Definitely would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The hummus appetizer was great as was the lemon poppy French toast. Cute atmosphere and great service too"}
{"text":"In the words of my mama, wooooo child! Lol the best breakfast I've ever had hands down. The red velvet waffle was perfect! The chicke was well seasoned and the hash browns were fresh and on point. The mimosa didn't lack anything and actually gave us all a slight buzz. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals as well. From what i was told they had the best steak and eggs in the world. The steak was a small portion though. .. sort of pricey in all for breakfast but well worth it... th ey have a great selection. I would like to return and try a few other items on the menu...."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! Have been here twice for lunch. Food was great both times! Wait staff does a great job. Everyone is very friendly. Awesome looking food for breakfast too!!"}
{"text":"Ok Terrace Cafe. The food was pretty good. The hash brown are shredded and they don't have any onions on them, I suppose you can ask for that if you wanted it. I ordered the steak benedict, the steak came out cooked the way I asked. Unfortunately it came out with scrambled eggs, I sent it back and it came out like it was supposed to. My friend ordered the strawberry and french toast, it was decent. The BLT \"was good\" \"it tastes like a BLT.\" That was the feedback from the BLT. I ordered an iced coffee with the brown sugar flavoring. It was decent. Our server was slightly forgetful, he jacked up out order and it took him a while to bring things we asked for. All in all the consensus at the table was our food was good. At the time we got there we didn't have to wait, if we would have, I think the rating would have been lower."}
{"text":"The below review was written by my husband....  Went on Sunday. Supposedly, you can't make reservations for Sunday, but I heard people doing \"call aheads\" ... which is the same as a reservation in my book! Put name on list for 15-20 minute wait. Waited more that 20 minutes. Went inside and asked for update. Hostess said she texted our phone twice with no response and then deleted our spot. We received absolutely NO texts. This happened to 2-3 other people that I personally witnessed. Other groups of more people arrived ahead of us, ate and left before us (on a day with no reservations). The chicken apple sausage used to be two links (I think) and now it's one link cut lengthwise. The crab cakes benedict were ok and my wife's pancakes were ok, but they didn't say that the cakes came with powdered sugar by default which is something she doesn't like. So, the wait and the \"ok\" food are enough of a reason to not go back for Sunday breakfast for quite a while. We loved our server and the hostess seated us immediately after I asked for an update. So, I'd have to say that the service was decent, but was  the overall experience compelling enough to warrant a return visit (any time soon)? No."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles, tasty. Sunday brunch is a zoo - but worth the wait. Great coffee selection. Fresh, simple foods. Service needs some work but all in all a good thing going over at Terrace."}
{"text":"Seriously, there's just not too much more good stuff I can say about this place that the other reviews haven't mentioned.   So I'll just keep it simple and tell you what I like:   My absolute favorite item here is the Red Velvet waffle and of course you HAVE to add the chicken. It's the combination of sweet and savory that keeps me coming back again and again. I'm always changing up the sides but you can't go wrong with any of them.   I've never been disappointed here. This place is good for friends, out of town guests and good ol' Sunday brunch.   Get yourself there."}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast here for the first time and loved it!! My wife LOVED the shrimp and grits, and I really enjoyed the eggs Benedict. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back again to start our day of right!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was absolutely delicious. I'm giving it a 4/5 because they wouldn't allow me to substitute the pancakes for a waffle when ordering the full breakfast. So I ordered the chicken and waffles instead and it was really good!!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Charlotte, no competition.  This place get absolutely packed on Sundays. Come early and bring yourself a book or buy yourself a few Bloody's. Or both. They have a Diablo (extra spicy), bacon Bloody and regular Bloody. I always get the bacon Bloody with a little extra spice. The latte's are also tasty and come in flavors ranging from blueberry to peanut butter. Can't speak on the blueberry, but peanut butter is phenomenal.  Unfortunately, they removed the s'mores french toast from the menu last year, which was my favorite, but they still have the famed red velvet waffle. Yes, you can also add fried chicken. Yes, it is as good as it sounds.  Grits are fluffy and creamy. Hashbrowns are shredded and deep fried - probably not made in house but still pretty good.   The biscuits and gravy and bacon, sausage and cheese sandwiches are delicious as well.  Go here. Seriously."}
{"text":"I've eaten at TC once before for brunch and have been wanting to make it back. They have great mimosas, cocktails and a famous red velvet waffle!  This time, we went in for brunch on a Friday. They do brunch M-S until 3pm, which is great. We need more places in Charlotte doing daily brunches! The hubs got a chai tea latte, which was very delicious. Perfect amount of foam and spice and not overly sweet. Also, it's served in a nice comfortable large mug.  I went with the Florentine Benedict with a side of Canadian Bacon. Pro tip: add the bacon to your benedict. Delicious and adds a whole new savory flavor dimension. The Benedict was very good, and the home fries were crispy, just as I like them! I stole some bites of my husbands lemon poppyseed French toast. It's served with icing and berries and comes with 3 pieces. I found the French toast slightly too crumbly, but my husband loved it!  Service was decent, though it was pretty busy on a Friday afternoon. Next time I'll have to get the fried chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe has a quality brunch menu.  The food is well seasoned and flavorful.  They are located in a nice walking area if you want to get a few steps in before or after the meal.  Their crab cakes eggs Benedict is my favorite dish on the menu.  Always delicious.  I've heard the red velvet waffles are amazing so I can't wait to try them on my next visit!  They have amazing shrimp and grits.  Be careful if you don't eat pork, they do put sausage in it.  I always substitute mind with the chicken sausage instead and it still tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I used to really like Terrace Cafe but the food and service has been declining. Our last visit was the last straw. It was a weekday morning so tables were readily available. It took a long time for the host to come back to the stand. That is fine. But the weird part is the two bartenders who were not busy at 10:30am looked at us like we're annoying - like we were interrupting their conversation. Then multiple servers made eye contact with us and walked by. Wouldn't it be normal to say good morning, we will be right with you? I truly felt like I walked into a private function and the dirty looks were to get us to leave. I was so close to leaving and I should have. We were taken upstairs and seated at a 2 top as close to a booth with very young and loud children. Then a table of four with a screaming child from the start was seated next to us. The other table dissolved into full blown on the floor meltdowns. We asked to move to the side of the top where no people were when we were originally seated. We quickly learned the upstairs is the child section as that section then had kids too. It was impossible to finish the crab cake Benedict given the screaming - meltdown screaming. Downstairs, there was not one table with children. Given that the food is mediocre at best, this was just unacceptable. When I asked the host why he would put two adults in the section that was clearly filled with kids, he said it was part of the rotation but did notice the tantrum  occurring on the floor. Oh well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast. I couldn't finish my steak and eggs so I took the rest to go. It was still good later on as a snack. The staff was polite. The atmosphere was peaceful."}
{"text":"Customer Service: My family and I have eaten at Terrace Cafe on many occasions, and never had the need to say anything negative about our experiences. We have always gone during the morning or early afternoon hours. On last Friday, (1-2-15) we ate at Terrace for dinner.   The cafe was mostly empty except for 3 other tables of patrons. My family placed our orders and my husband and I asked for \"sweet\" tea. First of all, the waitress took about 15 minutes to bring our drinks which I thought was very odd, considering there were so few patrons in the restaurant. When my husband and I tasted our tea, it was unsweetened!  Mind you, as I mentioned earlier, we have eaten at Terrace many times and have ordered their sweet tea most of those times. Each time, it has been appropriately sweet, even to the point of being too sweet.  This time however, the tea was definitely unsweetened. We told our waitress and she apologized and bought us out two more glasses of \"sweet\" tea. Again we tasted out tea and it was just like the first glasses, UNSWEETENED!!   This time, my husband walked to the front and told the waitress the tea was still unsweetened. 10 minutes later she comes to our table and says, \" I'm sorry but I don't understand, I usually don't drink tea but I tasted the tea and thought it was sweet and my co-worker tasted the tea and she also thought it was sweet!  Are you kidding me!!!!! So what she was really trying to say is that there must be something wrong with our taste buds because we, the employees think it's sweet!! Mind you, I have tasted Terrace's \"sweet\" tea and it has always been appropriately sweet! I ended up canceling my drink order and just drank water.  So, here are my comments  to this situation:   Firstly, as your patron, please don't insult my intelligence by putting the burden of proof on the customer. In this situation, the customer is ALWAYS right! (Customer Service 101).  Secondly, The manager on duty usually comes to the patrons table whenever there is a dispute or misunderstanding of some type with the patron. The manager on duty never approached our table.  Thirdly, repeat customers are bred as a result of repeat positive customer experiences, even during challenges.  Finally, My family and I initially went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner but had to wait 1 1/2 hours for a table. This was the reason for our dinner trip to Terrace. Terrace is known for it's long lines during breakfast hours but I wonder why there was hardly anyone there during dinner hours???? Hmmmmmm just an observation!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast. It's been said over and over... Get the Red Velvet waffle!! We ordered it as an app so we could both enjoy. The breakfast casserole was wonderful. My BF got the Low Country Boil Hash special. Only came with 4 shrimp tho. For $16 I would expect more than 4. That's the only reason I give 4 stars. I really liked our server. He seemed really busy but never made us feel neglected. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Confused as to why this place is highly rated. Solid 3 stars at best. Service was great, but the food was mediocre. Our selections (chicken and waffles, french toast, and some egg soufflé) left us underwhelmed by the lack of \"taste\". Wouldn't  return."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast. Never disappoints. Best biscuits and gravy in Charlotte. The staff is always friendly and have never gotten anything by great service. My go to restaurant for breakfast."}
{"text":"It's amazing the atmosphere & the great food fits right together if you love brunch/breakfast like i do it's the best spot"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! The food and the waiter.  Other than the crazy NC law that meant I couldn't have a brunch mimosa this is one of the greatest brunches I have ever hat!"}
{"text":"Hello....anyone there? That's what we kept asking when we could never find our server. The food is pretty decent but the service is awful.   If you're looking for breakfast I would go somewhere else. An hour meal takes you almost 2. For breakfast! Would not recommend"}
{"text":"The first time I went to this restaurant about four years ago, I was blown away with service, the atmosphere, the variety on the menu and most importantly the food. We ordered their pancakes, fruit, shrimp and grits and a few other items. They were all amazing. We had a bit of a wait for our table but it was well worth it. (This was the South Park location). Then we went a second and third time and the wait was particularly long, the service was very average and while the menu didn't seem different, the quality of the food was significantly different. So we decided to try the Ballantyne location and we were shocked at the difference between the two locations. The Ballantyne restaurant didn't have as long of a wait and the menu was the same, but the restaurant itself was not very clean, the food did not taste good and the atmosphere was crowded and not very friendly. I have not since returned to this restaurant at either location."}
{"text":"I have been to the Ballantyne location for lunch before but I've yet to experience the legendary brunch I've heard so much about. Apparently everyone else has heard a lot about it because there was a 30 min wait. In fact they stayed on a wait during the entire time we were there. That's always a good sign.  We were seated at 11:30 and our waiter was right there to take care of us. We both got caramel lattes. I was impressed by their amazing coffee selection/espresso bar. It's not often that you find that in a restaurant. The coffee was delicious and came complete with some foam designs.  I got the eggs Benedict and it was delicious. I also got a side of the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese. They were awesome!! My friend got the full breakfast and she enjoyed it. Service was excellent from beginning to end. Worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of yummy breakfast options. Only been for breakfast and service was good. Busy on Sundays which I'd expect. Terrace cafe is definitely one of my top breakfast spots."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast or lunch. Bloody Mary's with bacon... What's not to love.  I try to visit here every time that I'm in town. Red Velvet waffles with fried chicken are a sweet and savory treat for breakfast.  For lunch I've enjoyed the crab cake BLT or the Nashville fried chicken.  Both are delicious and filling.  Service is fast and fantastic. This is great little cafe."}
{"text":"A must for breakfast! The staff is friendly, the restaurant is very clean, and food is always fresh and delicious! There is typically a wait on Sunday mornings but if you're willing to wait it's worth it.   Try the omelette and red velvet waffles!"}
{"text":"I have try pretty much everything on the menu. The chicken and red velvet waffle is the best in my opinion.I had to take a moment to admire their latte art because it is just too cute!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and decided to visit while I was in Charlotte and was not disappointed. It is great for breakfast. I enjoyed the quick and friendly service despite the long wait lines (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars) although I will say it was completely worth it. I ordered the signature red velvet waffle with cream cheese frosting/syrup and it was especially delicious with a side of fruit. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"I love this place! I loved that we were able to grab bar seating on a Sunday at noon the moment we walked it. We were able to \"skip\" the line because of bar seating. YES! I felt awesome because of this. Bar seating was definitely a great experience especially for our first time at Terrace Cafe as the bar is right next to the kitchen. I can see the chefs working hard to ensure that the plates of food are set correctly before sending them out to patrons to enjoy. I enjoyed observing the chefs work while I enjoy my meal.   FOOD - Steak & Eggs || two perfectly cooked filet medallions, two eggs, and choice of either grits or hash browns -- I ordered both. I requested my filet medallions to be medium and they were just perfect. I ordered my eggs over easy and placed them on top of my sliced and toasted croissant. I was scared my hash browns were going to be soggy and not crispy so I ordered them to be well done or extra crispy; however, I found out that this is not needed as mine were too crispy. The Steak & Eggs were just perfect. It's a must order. I'm craving it at this moment! - Eggs Benedict - Filet || two filet medallions, two eggs, and hollandaise sauce all on top of biscuits with a side of hash browns. Very nice twist to eggs benedict. If you're craving steak and eggs benedict at the same time --- you should try ordering this.  - Long Island Peach Tea || Adult Drink -- very good and very strong. i love the twist that they have to the traditional Long Island by adding Peach flavors. - Pineapple Guava Sangria || Adult Drink -- this drink was very light as it only has white wine and is mixed with lots of fruit juices like guava and pineapple. Something you should order if you're looking for a light adult drink with your meal.  SERVICE/AMBIANCE/LAST NOTES Service was impeccable. I know we sat a the bar and service should be the best since we are right next to the kitchen, but I can see that if we sat at a regular table, our service would be impeccable as well as you see the servers working hard to get food out to patrons. The restaurant is surprisingly very spacious as there are tables upstairs and downstairs. Parking is free as you can park around the complex. If there is a wait, please see the hostess, give your name and phone numbers and she will text you when you're table is ready.   Overall, this is my favorite restaurant by far this weekend and I will definitely come back to visit Charlotte because of Terrace Cafe. Many friends suggested that I should try the Red Velvet Waffles with a drizzle of cream cheese -- which I will try on my next visit as it is a very popular item!"}
{"text":"Honestly, can anyone in their right mind rate this place below a 5?    Lets break it down for someone who hasn't been here:  The food is ALWAYS (and I mean every single thing I have ever ordered) right and tastes great, even when they are slam packed, which is often.   There are some fun things on the menu (especially breakfast) that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  Ex. red velvet waffle, WOW  The staff is always busy but always friendly  My only complaint is that they are so damn good they get busy and there is often a wait but I can't hate on them for being too popular!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waffle was good flavor but very soft more like a pancake.  Latte was very good.  We also had an omelet which was good along with nice crispy hash browns.  I am giving a 3 because of our waitress.  Service could have been better.  The waitress wasn't the friendliest, when we asked questions she answered very fast and seemed annoyed when we asked her to repeat what she said.  She didn't come around to our table much to check on us either.  Because of the lack of good service it took away from the experience.  The food was good and no real complaints but service needs work."}
{"text":"May I vent first thing about Piedmont Row, not Terrace Cafe?  I was all excited about trying TC, I decided to meet  one of my friends for an early lunch.   I hop on my bike, a brand new orange Electra Townie no less and park it in between Terrace Cafe and Dolcetto, two businesses that we should frequent so they can thrive.  Don't you know some man from somewhere does not like my bike locked  to a light post, rats me out to the security guard and there is a ruckus to get me to move my bike.We had already been seated and ordered and our food was on the tray on the way out of the kitchen.  I am in the restroom and  my friend sees them shaking my lock and  looking at my bike, she goes out and they tell her to park it somewhere else.  My friend said, \"our food is on the way, can't we move it in a minute?\"  It had to be taken care of that instant.    What were they going to do?  Fine me?  Tow my bike?  Jeez.  I moved it, but now I think I should have protested.  WTF?  Anyway, back to the matter at hand.    Terrace Cafe....  When I arrive, I  order some coffee, my friend shakes her head and makes me try her coffee first.  WEAK.  Am I the only person that hates weak coffee in a breakfast establishment?  I don't want cowboy coffee, I just want some decent coffee.  So, I order a latte.  A beautiful latte comes out.  Yeah!!!   I vacillate between breakfast and lunch, what a big decision.  Lunch wins, I decide on a half sandwich and 2 soups.  Interesting.  The concept of two soups, why make a decision, have both!!!  Boo, they were redundant.  Two broth soups.  The server said chicken noodle and vegetable.  Maybe it was my Campbell soup upbringing thinking veggie soup was tomato, my bad.   The BLT was thick sourdough bread, one slice was soggy, they were slathered in butter and then barely toasted.  Tomatoes had been in the fridge.  I think they care, but maybe just need some honest feedback.    My server was very nice and sincere and she was appalled that they made me move my bike. Even the security guard thought the guy was crazy too.    Did I mention I had to move my bike to the back of the shops at Piedmont Row near the YMCA?    I will go back to Terrace Cafe, they did have cocktails, so I am going back for breakfast and a bloody mary.  I will park my bike near the Y, so the uptight man can get on with his work and not be bothered with the eyesore of my Townie parked at a light post. GASP.  Follow up: went today (2oct) with another friend, we sat at the bar and ordered bloody marys and an order of onion rings.  The bloody marys were fabulous and garnished with bacon, need I say more?  Since my return, the coffee was much better!!!"}
{"text":"My friend had eaten here and told me how she got food poisoning because half way through eating her food, she found that there was mold on the fruit. She told them about it, they apologized, she paid, the end.   I thought by her telling them about their spoiled fruit, they would be more careful about it. I was craving their SEC biscuit today and wanted the fruit as a \"healthier\" side. Biscuit was good as usual and I even checked the fruit to make sure. It looked good but as soon as I picked up the raspberry, there was a blueberry underneath covered in mold!!!! Ewwwwww! I can't believe it happened to me too!!   I was so upset I took the cup of fruit back to show the manager and his respond was \"I apologize, do you want another cup of fruit?\" Was he waiting for me to say \"Yes, please give me another cup of fruit full of mold. I've been waiting all my life to eat that!\"?   How about give me back the money I spent on that nasty cup of fruit that I don't want? But of course he didn't offer. Of course I had to pay for that with the mold in it.   Please stay away from this location! Bad fruit and bad management overall."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because the pictures looked great however it left me a little disappointed. I took a seat at the bar while I waited for a table during a busy Sunday brunch. Service was good and I ordered a Terrace Bellini which was fantastic. After a little while, the table was ready so we were sat in the dining area. I ordered the red velvet waffle with fried chicken (which I had eyed hungrily while sitting at the bar with order after order of these going out) and my girlfriend ordered a build your own omelette with vegetables. My food arrived but it was a little cold and not as good as I had hoped. The chicken skin wasn't crispy but had good flavor. I tasted my girlfriend's omelette and it tasted like they hadn't used any salt at all. This place definitely has potential but they need to work on their execution."}
{"text":"Ok, so we had been trying to get to this restraunt for a few months. We decided to go last night for my fiancee's birthday, and was that the biggest mistake we ever made? Yes. The night started off with ham and pimento cheese sliders which were so salty, I must have gone through 2 waters and an unsweet tea just to wash the taste out of my mouth. The barbacue sauce on the frenched chicken drummette's was waaaaaay to sweet and overpowered by the amount of ketchup and sugar they must have made it with. For dinner, the fried southern chicken came with green beans that had absolutely NO seasoning, mashed potatoes that were too salty, and gravy on the chicken that was salty. The filet came with a sauce on it that tasted like sh*t. I mean, there was no other way to describe it, and when I'm spending $25 on an 8oz filet, I at least want to be able to eat it. I mean, it was so disgusting. The sauteed mushrooms, I actually had to put salt and pepper on them. I have NEVER EVER done that at a restraunt. It's like they don't season half the food and overseason the other half. No balance anywhere. The dessert wasn't as bad, but how can you mess up a cookie? Especially one that Cracker Barrel also has but their's is way bigger and costs $5 less. The red velvet bread pudding wasn't that bad but it was way too thick and pastey. It was the WORST experience I have ever had with food at a restraunt. They need Gordan Ramsey so bad, wow. DO NOT EAT HERE. I'm paying for it today. O, and the waiter was so awkward, just kind of hovering around our table. Really strange."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. Both times there was a wait, it seems as if there is ALWAYS a wait on a Sunday late morning/early afternoon. The service is nice. The food is great. The first time we had the stuffed french toast. IT WAS AMAZING! When we returned, it said they were french toast sticks, not sure why they changed it. Also, the first time we had the chicken and waffles. IT WAS AMAZING! The chicken was fried to perfection and the waffle was so yummy.   This recent time we ordered the Lemon Poppy french toast, which tasted more like a pound cake, but it was AMAZING! We also ordered the special for that day which was a chocolate chip waffle, with white chocolate drizzle. I was also amazing and not super sweet or chocolatey.   This is in our Yelp \"Favorites\" collection."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Decor: A+, Staff: A+, Food: A+!  Just ate a delicious \"full breakfast\" (scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, & 2 pancakes + fruit cup). So yummy! Hashbrowns were perfect! Just the way I like them - shredded! Matt was a great waiter, too!"}
{"text":"Used to come here on a regular basis- admittedly it was always for breakfast or lunch. Went for dinner last night and was extremely disappointed. Has this place changed ownership? Something has gone awry. Wine had to be sent back. Calamari appetizer came out cold and chewy. (When it was replaced with a hot version, it was delicious though.) Half of our party's entrees were delicious- but half came out completely cold.  We finally gave up sending cold items back. What was going on in the kitchen?? Service was so slow I had to take mine to go in the end. Server was pleasant but slammed. Manager does not go out of his way to be particularly pleasant. This used to be one of our go-to restaurants.  Not any more."}
{"text":"Yum this place is so good.  I had a chance to stop in for lunch and I was just as impressed with my lunch selection as I was when I had dinner here.   If you get a chance the roasted red pepper & gouda soup is out of this world amazing.  This place is hopping during lunch.  The food and service were both excellent.  Now I must make it back for some brunch next time."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday around 930am and it was perfectly open with tables available. We walked in and were seated immediately. I've been to the Ballantyne location several times and have loved it.   Ordered the BBQ Chicken quiche for my entree and where I can say it had great flavor, it definitely lacked in structure. Think it was just a matter of being cooked long enough, but it was definitely falling apart. Also, the dressing on the salad as a little wonky. I did love that the fruit on the side had the option of being all berries. Big plus.   The rest of the meal was stellar per usual. Killer oatmeal, hashbrowns, orange juice, and silly, tilty glasses.   Keep it rockin', Terrace. You've got a space in my heart. Cheers."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that opened up in the trendy mixed use (residential/commercial) area called Piedmont Row.  Very close to South Park mall.     A very welcomed addition!  Although I stopped in at lunch time, they have a great breakfast menu.  Will is great to have another option other than the Original Pancake House in the S Park area.  Lunch was great and the service was friendly.  I sat at the bar area and ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  Was cooked perfectly.  Sitting at the bar, you could see the kitchen area and you could tell they were still working some of the bugs out on the computer system and still perfecting the food presentation.  Still, there was nothing that prevented the service and food from being wonderful.  I can not wait to get there for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The red velvet was good,but I've tasted better...Just being honest...The server was on point...The shrimp and grits was very good...I must say it was different...So Come try them out...Nice environment and very nice people"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!  Had the fish and chips and it was amazing!  Huge portion of fish.  Definitely want to try the red velvet waffle!  Crab cake appetizer was great too.  Really enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna jump right to it. Today was my last visit to TC. I have been coming here since around 2009, 10 and it's dived into a giant pool of mediocre. I'd say over the last 3 visits they have pretty much missed on everything. Today, we literally had the overall worse service  EVER! We waited over 45 minutes to be seated and people who came after us were seat before us. Once seated, we waited for water/drinks. After our food was served, we waited for utensils, we waited for coffee refills,  we waited for our check. We pretty much blew a whole Saturday on breakfast. They were very slow at cleaning the tables around us as we ate and those tables sat empty longer than expected. The larger parties received quick service and more attention and had I'd been paying, I wouldn't have left a tip at all. I felt totally disregarded as a customer from the moment I stepped in, until I walked out. There are much better breakfast /brunch spots in Charlotte. I will spend my time and money there."}
{"text":"This place has to be the best breakfast/brunch spot in Charlotte. Omelets and hashbrowns are great."}
{"text":"A la carte pricing isn't my favorite thing but the food is good. Nice atmosphere, parking, not bad...."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Terrace after reading so many great reviews and also because of the vegan breakfast they have on the menu. To say that I was disappointed doesn't even begin to describe my experience. Our server was not only condescending and not very knowledgeable about the menu, she was not attentive at all. In fact, she came across as bored. Her behavior was an immediate turnoff. The food was \"okay.\" I'm sure the non-vegan fare is amazing but the vegan offering wasn't seasoned well and was over cooked. I had to ask repeatedly for my coffee to be refilled, and they kept giving everybody in our party the wrong order. It was a chaotic nightmare.   The only saving grace was that my company was fantastic so the conversation made the very poor service tolerable.   I will not be returning, at least not to the Southpark location. Perhaps the Ballantyne location has better trained servers."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Charlotte I come here. I have never been disappointed. It gets packed though and there can be a wait. It is well worth it.  The location is great because you can park in the deck and there is always parking. It is a smallish place, but they have some seating upstairs and a small bar as well.  I love the bloody mary here. The best anywhere. I love the hash browns and the red velvet waffle - OMG - to die for! Really good coffee drinks and great service.  The last time I went, some friends were in the area and wanted to join us, but we only had a table for 4. So we asked the server if we could add 3 more people and they moved the tables around to accommodate us, even though they were pretty busy at the time. I was really happy that they were able to do that, since I was visiting and wanted to be able to spend more time with my friends.  I have had dinner here as well and it has been awesome, but I keep coming back to the breakfast because it ROCKS!!!!  I wish they had these on the west coast!!!"}
{"text":"The red velvet waffle has to be my favorite. The atmosphere is nice, and the service is good. If you want to try new things there are a lot of twist to our regular entrees; such as, their chicken salad. Also, if they have tomato bisque, it is a must!"}
{"text":"Long wait on Sundays If you are interested in going for Sunday brunch, make sure to get there early/reservation. The food was ok.  I had the French toast.  Northing great or bad about it.  It was just French toast. I'm giving it more stars based on the ambience of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Remember the days, when you thought you had to eat at Waffle House, IHOP, or Cracker Barrel for breakfast on Saturday or Sunday mornings?  Not so much because they were especially great or anything, but maybe because you knew they were there for you, and could be counted on to provide a hearty and delicious breakfast, time and time again.  WELL, those days are over my friends.  Say, hello to Terrace Cafe.  I'm usually not one to dote over the intricacies of the decorations and feng-shui of a place, but Terrace Cafe truly has a remarkable interior.  The second you walk in, you are transported to a wonderful and peaceful cafe seemingly somewhere in the  Mediterranean.  My gf and I arrived there around 10am on Sunday morning, and were seated immediately with no wait.  We were taken for a nice walk throughout the restaurant, and upstairs to a table in the balcony overlooking the entire restaurant (see pics).  For breakfast, i ordered the Steak and Eggs w/ hash browns and an English muffin.  I order this every time I go here, maybe just switching up the English-muffin for toast.  It's not that I think the other menu choices will be less than satisfactory, but because the Steak and eggs are out of this WORLD!!  It comes with 2 or 3 eggs any way you like, and two steak fillet medallions (see pic).  These little medallions are as good as any steak I've had.  No sauce needed.  No knife needed.  Just good, tender beef.   My girlfriend ordered a pecan waffle with the fresh fruit cocktail as a side.  She loved it.  The waffle was cooked to perfection (I just had to eat some).  Warm syrup was also brought to the table just before the food arrived.  She loved the waffle as well as the fruit.  Explaining that the fruit was fresh and sweet.  As for the service...It was magnificent.  Nothing else needs to be said.    I'm a fan of everything about this place. Ive been here three times (all for breakfast) and have had tremendous dining experiences each and every time.  I do not have a single complaint about my dining experiences there - ever; in the three times I've been there.   Terrace Cafe is the BEST BREAKFAST SPOT IN CHARLOTTE!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a wonderful find!!  I visited the Terrance Cafe for brunch one Saturday and it was wonderful.  My boyfriend had a Bloody Mary, it was garnished with a piece of bacon (he loved it) and my mimosa was fantastic.  The blueberry fritters that they were handing out were to die for and my sensible egg white omelet was to die for."}
{"text":"The service torpedoed this review from 4 stars to 3. I went for breakfast and my eggs were cool when served. Not good. The staff made an effort to replace the eggs. I wouldn't say it took long to get the replacements, but by the time the warm eggs arrived, the rest of the meal had cooled down.  I went ahead and ate the breakfast and it would've probably been really good had it been served piping hot. To give the benefit of the doubt, Terrace was VERY busy which means they must get it right most of the time. Maybe it was just bad luck for me. My girlfriend did enjoy her breakfast.  Anyway, aside from that, the atmosphere of the place is quite nice. Its contemporary American and very lively for a morning spot. I'd probably give them another shot if I lived in the area but I was jut passing through.  Oh, and the final nitpick, the bill charged for 2 orders of eggs. The staff removed the additional order."}
{"text":"So glad i found this place!  I am big on brunch and was looking for a new brunch spot in charlotte and this is certainly it! I had the red velvet waffles and they were absolutely delicious and very filling. Everything ordered at our table was great, i will definitely be back. A+ for the presentation as well, i love food that looks almost too good to eat  Highly recommended for brunch."}
{"text":"I am incredibly disappointed to give such a poor review. I was so excited to try this place, especially the crab cake blt. I do have to note that the flavors of the dish were fine, not wonderful, but good enough to pay for. However my mother found two short black hairs on her plate. Neither of us have short black hair. The inexcusable part was the manner in which it was handled. The server was rude and unapologetic. And shockingly only half of the cost of the meal was removed from the bill. It is pretty standard in my opinion that when a dish is deemed inedible due to sanitation issues, it should be completely taken off."}
{"text":"I found the Terrace Cafe with a \"Weekday Brunch in Charlotte\" Google search. I had a friend in town for a job interview and we were in desperate need of a brunch spot. I was ill-prepared for just how many restaurants only have weekend brunch. All of that to say, my expectations weren't super high.   We began our brunch with the only downside of the experience--an extremely long wait! There were empty tables all around and folks were moving in and out somewhat quickly, but it. took. forever. Luckily, the wait was worth it. I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle. I was both excited and nervous about the choice. I mean, I LOVE some red velvet ANYTHING, but I'm also not a huge fan of exceedingly sweet dishes--especially for breakfast. I'm the girl that can only handle like 1/4 of a cupcake at a time. Max. The waffle was DELICIOUS, though, and just the right about of sweetness without being at all overpowering. My friend ordered the Lemon Poppy French Toast and was equally impressed! Our waiter was exceedingly charismatic, attentive (without being annoying), and just wonderful!  It was a somewhat accidental stumble-upon adventure. But, it was an all-around great experience and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"went to terrace cafe for breakfast this morning for a quick meeting.  i wasn't starving so i ordered a bacon/cheese biscuit which came with hashbrowns.  the food was good but not great.    the cafe was pretty busy for a wednesday morning and our waiter had a party upstairs so the service could have been better but i'd probably give it another try when i have a bigger appetite."}
{"text":"Call me a rebel, but I think their dinner is better than their brunch.  I've had brunch at Piedmont once and brunch at Ballantyne once and both were great (my friends love the bacon in the bloody mary) but dinner is some of the best upscale Southern food I've had.    The only reason I don't go more often is sometimes I'm too hungry to endure the wait, but if I plan ahead and make reservations it all works out."}
{"text":"What a unique and delicious place to go to for brunch on a Sunday morning (or any day really)! I went into terrace restaurants so excited to try their unique and drooling breakfast items and it didn't disappoint. They have so many things to choose from and if anyone is in NC, I will tell them Terrace Restaurants is a must go to! In addition, for it being Sunday brunch, it was not packed at all!  Tried: Fried chicken and red velvet waffle Carrot cake pancakes * BOTH were spot on !"}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte about a year and a half ago and this is where I take all of my visitors for breakfast or brunch. The chicken and waffles here are the best! The grits are really good and so are the fish and chips. They do not take reservations so there is usually a wait but it is worth it! Sometimes you can get a seat at the bar when you first go in."}
{"text":"My experiences with the food and drink are far better at weekend mornings/brunch service than on weekdays. On good days, the bar makes a very tasty chai. On not-so-good days, it's watered down and not blended well. Recommended dishes: red velvet waffle, Terrace French toast, bacon or pecan waffle. The s'more waffle is too sweet for a meal, it works well as a dessert, though. The service has always been good even when they're slammed. If you're planning to go Sunday for brunch, plan to wait for a table due to this place's popularity, but it's worth it of you plan for it.  They will not seat you until your entire party is present."}
{"text":"Seth, my waiter, was super cool. Red velvet waffle, fried chicken & cheese grits are like Holidays status like yo very own mama or grandma took they time to welcome you home type meal!!"}
{"text":"I really like this cafe. For once, a restaurant that exceeded my expectations. If I'm ever back in Charlotte I'll make a return visit for brunch.   Prices are right. Service was great. Food is done with care.  My mother ordered the beef soup and a half order of a turkey sandwich. The beef soup surprisingly came with collard greens in it, and the turkey sandwich was filled with grilled onions, melted cheese, chopped turkey, and crispy bacon.  I ordered the Egg Benedict Floratine and I appreciated the care that was taken with the dish. It came topped with crispy fried onions, and the spinach was correctly sautéed.   Only complaint is the chairs need an upgrade, and the lower level dining room floor plan could have been designed better without placing restrooms facing patrons as they eat."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. I have only been for breakfast but it is amazing. I got the waffle and fried green tomatoes, nice portion.  Coffee is good. Quality of food is outstanding. For the price can't beat it. Will be back."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles and chicken are the only dish I can personally speak for as I can't seem to try anything else.  The waffle is nice and crisp on the outside and soft moist and flavorful on in the inside.  The cream cheese drizzle is the icing on the cake, no need for syrup.  The chicken is extremely moist and well seasoned and fried to perfection.  I get ranch as my dipping sauce and it  too is delicious and fresh made.    The sweet tea never disappoints and they also make a delicious cup of coffee.  My kids love their pancakes and bacon.  My husband enjoyed their shrimp and grits when he's not getting chicken and waffles.  I have found the food and service to be better going during the week vs. on Sunday's for brunch.  This could be because of the crowd for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Overrated!  Big long line on Sunday and sadly, it wasn't worth the wait. Although was our waitress was nice, she was not attentive. The fried green tomatoes had no flavor. My crabs cakes were burnt and too salty. The hash browns were only toasted on only one side and the remaining were snow white!!  My turkey bacon was totally limp and undercooked. Mimosas had no garnish and no bubbles."}
{"text":"This is an wonderful breakfast/brunch restaurant! The turtle latte is a must! We always get the Steak Benedict and they always cook it perfectly! We've order the following:  Banana Pecan Toast - this was delicious but definitely on the sweet side. If you don't like sweet items, do not order this.   Steak Benedict - this was my favorite! Ordered with a side of hash browns added mushrooms, onions and cheese on top.   Spicy Chicken Biscuit - this was spicy! The pimento cheese is a great combo BUT the ghost peppers aren't a joke.   Shrimp and grits - this definitely had a true Cajun flavor."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for brunch - any time of day, every day! The food is delicious and the restaurant itself is classy and quirky.   My favorite thing to order is the red velvet waffle - everyone should try it at least once (AT LEAST!!). I wasn't as impressed with the Banana Pecan French Toast, which was drowned in maple syrup to the point of being as soft as apple sauce. Nonetheless, at least the flavor was still good. I've also tried a latte here before (I forgot the flavor), which was tasty and had cool latte art.  I read a lot of review with complaints about long lines, but each time I've been I've gotten a seat immediately. I went on weekdays both times and the first time I went was after 1pm while the second time was after 7pm."}
{"text":"So when we first got here we waited quite a while (my party is a group of 7) . We watched several party's be seated and receive their food . In the same time we didn't even get a drink order for ten minutes , come to find out there was a party of 16-20 that was seated quick and received their food ( explains why it took so long) . My table didn't get to order at the same time until the manager showed up (who was friendly).  The food was really good . Everyone enjoyed . However the service was slow and w happened to be the only ones left in the restaurant waiting to end our service . Regardless , if you have time to WAIT . Cool."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to munch on quality food.  EZ parking, warm interior, wide selection, and friendly staff make 4-stars a no-brainer IMO.  I'm a simple breakfast eater, mostly due to diet restrictions, so I cannot comment on their sweet stuff (although those red velvet pancakes were popping up on every table--damn those high carbs!).  My omelet was cooked perfectly and served piping hot.  I opted for some cheesy grits which were OK (everyone said try the hash browns but I panicked and forgot).  My server, Julie, was a joy and I hope Mgt notices her contribution.  Thanks for a well-rounded experience.  I'll bring Lori next time and sit upstairs sipping mimosas while holding hands :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times in the past and it was pretty good.  I went this week and it was terrible.  The food just didn't taste good and came out sort of warm.  The staff seemed too busy taking pictures of stuff that day and we were one of only 3 tables of people.  My friend asked for some salsa to try to add some flavor to her eggs and there was a $3 charge for it on her bill, which she was not told about ahead of time.  I had several $1 charges on my bill for random things also not mentioned to me.  My omelette and my one year old's kids meal was $30."}
{"text":"The food was good but if you're going there on a weekend to sit at the bar, don't expect the best service. It took at least ten minutes for someone to actually come over and say anything to me. I had to yell to someone over the noise \"can I get a menu?\" Finally when the girl said she was coming to wipe down the area where I was sitting, she never came back so when I saw her again I had to ask if she was going to wipe it down. She said \"we're super busy I'm so sorry I'll get to it as soon as I can.\" She finally came back five minutes later wiped it down and finally asked what I wanted, 15 minutes after I'd arrived. Then some woman, who is barely dressed, halter top, skin showing, boobs out, THE WORKS, comes in, sits at the bar, takes off her expensive sunglasses and places her expensive purse down, and all the staff behind the bar come rushing to her asking what she needs, does she want water, how's she doing. Its funny because even with all her expensive possessions, she was asking \"well how much if I do this or that?\" If you can afford those expensive glasses but can't buy some eggs, get your priorities in order. All I can do is look like \"well perhaps next time I'll show a little more skin and flash a flirty smile so people will wait on me hand and foot.\" It's amazing what people will do when they \"think\" customers have money. This is crazy. I thought I left crap like that in Atlanta but I guess it's all the same in Charlotte. (ps chick took a pic of her food to post on Soc media when it came, wow. Real classy) Thanks for the omelette tho, Terrace Cafe. -Sincerely, Frustrated ISU Doc Student on a writing break looking for good food and service"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch and dinner us actually pretty good. Red velvet waffle is to die for. Must try if you are looking for a great Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I have only ate here once but the food was great. I had the shrimp and grits. It's a tad pricy and can be very busy with long wait times! I would still go back..cute atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The recommendations were right on the money here...I also had an outstanding server whose name is Tashi...thanks for the great service"}
{"text":"Every Sunday I try to convince myself to branch out and experience a new brunch place in Charlotte. And every Sunday without fail I'm back here again. I just can't get enough of this place. The Bavarian Creme Stuffed French Toast and Red Velvet Waffle are currently dueling for top spot on the sweet side. The Southern Biscuits and Gravy reigns supreme as far as savory is concerned.   The food is 5 stars all the way, but the service has often left something to be desired. Granted, I'm going during what I imagine is their busiest time on their busiest day of the week, but I always feel a bit like an inconvenience to the wait staff.   I also struggle to understand a brunch place that doesn't incorporate bacon as a preset side, particularly with their sweet dishes. When asked if the hash browns or grits that accompany the waffles could be switched out for bacon, I've always been told no, not even for an extra charge. And $4.25 is just too extravagant a price for a few strips of bacon.    Apart from those aspects though, I've always left overly full and overall pleased.   Pro tip: if visiting on a Sunday at prime time, put your name on the list and walk around the corner for a manicure at Cachet. By the time your nails are drying, you should be getting a text that your table is ready."}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time today, and it was awesome. I had the chicken and waffles which were delicious! The chicken was some of the best I've ever had!! I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Good job, Terrace Cafe and all who make you who you are.  As a connesiuer of fine brunch establishments, only Toast Cafe in Davidson delivers a comparable breakfast.  I applaud your effort and achievement in the breakfast arena.  The wait, which I expected, was worth it.  The decor was unconventional, a mesh of three themes, diner/cafe/loft.  Although you would wonder how those concepts can be welded together into one , Terrace Cafe you have pulled it off."}
{"text":"I had the \"RED VELVET WAFFLES\" with cream cheese drizzle. Talk about light, fluffy and delicious this waffle was terrific, it came with a fried chicken breast which to me was a little dry, but hey it's a chicken breast. LOL! The restaurant was very busy, we went on a Sunday around 1:30 PM even though they were crowded, we were seated fairly quickly and served in a reasonable amount of time. We had a group of 10 and our waiter was very good. I would also recommend you get the white mocha coffee"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my wife for valentine's weekend breakfast.  The adventure started with one of the rudest hosts that we have ever encountered. Waited while he sat people he knew in front if us and empty tables were visible. Waitress and wonderful food made up for the awful host. Try the red velvet waffles.  They are fabulous."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've been to Terrace before for breakfast and it was good, but skip this restaurant for dinner. Not enough bread for our table and it took forever to take our order. They were severely understaffed for dinner service. Waited at least 20 minutes for our waitress to return our bill so we could pay and leave. Our waitress wasn't at fault: it was management who gave her no support."}
{"text":"Pretty standard brunch options. Average wait for Charlotte. Love their coffee; they serve Magnolia which is locally-roasted. Family-friendly; good amount of parking in the garage."}
{"text":"Big portions and very good food. I had the biscuits and gravy he and my partner had the crabcakes."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles!  Scrumptious!! The waffles are thick and fluffy. The chicken is hot, crispy, tender and juicy inside! Add hot buttered grits and Tadaaaaa!  Service is fast. Parking is plentiful. Prices are very good! Food is delicious and there are a lot of options to choose from. Breakfast, sandwiches, entrees, sides, u name it! They have it!"}
{"text":"I had a 5 hour layover in Charlotte last week so a friend picked my husband and me up at the airport for a nice breakfast. Hence how we ended up at the Terrace Café. What a treat that ended up turning into.  I had the sausage gravy over biscuits. I'm a big fan of Bob Evans S&B but don't live near one now so I'm always looking to top the deliciousness of those. The Terrace Café exceeded my expectations. The biscuits where light and fluffy and the sausage (made fresh in their kitchen) was tasty but not greasy. The perfect blend of flavors in a light creamy gravy. It came with a side salad which I thought was a bit weird for breakfast and then regretted that I didn't eat it since later my husband and our friend told me it was really good with a light dressing that was actually complementary to the meal (so what do I know?).  Our friend had the eggs benedict which he raved about and my husband had the full breakfast which included eggs, bacon and pancakes. Being quite the connoisseur on pancakes my husband raved about them.  The only complaint I had was that I thought they must have been packing meat in their dining room because it was FREEZING in there. When I asked the waiter about it he told me that apparently it gets so warm in the afternoon that they have to keep it cool in the morning. That's great for the afternoon diners but why should I have to be uncomfortable to accommodate later diners? We were all uncomfortably cold and left as soon as we were finished eating which was too made because we would have liked to hang out a bit have more coffee and visit. My husband even said that by the time he got to the end of his meal it wasn't warm any longer. Now THAT'S cold.  Overall though the food was wonderful and I'd definitely recommend it. You may however want to try it in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food.  Honestly, our server did not have a lot of personality but he was incredibly efficient. I'm fine with that. The food is definitely worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Not too long of a wait, but a packed house, which was a good sign that Terrace Cafe is the place to be on a Sunday for brunch.   Took my mom and her friend here since I've heard this is a great place to eat and treat! The atmosphere was very nice, spacious, and gave off a warm feeling. The food was very good! The coffee, however, not the best.   The service was attentive and we never felt neglected for one second.   I don't think they offer valet parking (like many of the other Piedmont Row restaurants), but the garage is right next to Terrace.  All in all, great place and I will be back...just not for coffee."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is a great brunch spot.  We stopped in here a Saturday morning/afternoon to get some brunch and of course mimosas.  We you first walk in, you see a bar, some seating on ground level, and then an exposed upstairs which is where we sat.  This place just feels new and clean, while still having some charm to it.       The food here is awesome.  I had the red velvet waffle and the lady had the eggs benedict  The egg was poached nicely, but the red velvte waffle reigned supreme. I honestly wanted to lather my body with the cream cheese drizzle, though I don't know what unwanted person I may attract.      The food, mimosas, and the service were great.  I aso distinctly remember the odd shaped glasses for some reason. The only thing that put me off a little bit is the price.  It was a bit higher for brunch, but you do get what you pay for.  Overall I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my fiancé and my cousins. It was soooo good! The red velvet waffle was amazing! I was hesitant to get it because I'm not crazy about red velvet but I was feeling adventurous. I also got a side of cheese grits with it and it was heavenly as well. One of my cousins got the shrimp & grits and she loved it! On top of the great food, our waitress was really funny and down to earth! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the red velvet waffles and the chef's hash.  Both were amazing unique and very flavorful."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great but the food was horrible. I ordered the breakfast casserole and it was dry and cold in the center. Instead of removing the dish from my bill she asked me to leave a customer service complaint. I highly recommend that you try the other location as this one doesn't provide good customer service."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant yesterday. The service and the atmosphere were wonderful. The food was also fantastic! I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the red velvet waffles. Both entrees were very delicious! I really loved everything about this place!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant twice now and have gotten the crabcakes benedict.....my mouth jumps for joy when I receive this scrumptious plate of tastiness!!! So good. I can't wait to move on to other entrees. But until then....I'll keep asking for the \"crabcakes benedict please !\""}
{"text":"We loved this place! My boyfriend and I went there for brunch and the food was amazing. This place is so cute and even has an upstairs overlooking the downstairs. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the few servers that we came in contact with weren't really that attentive and almost acted as if they had something better to do. Not too pricey but the food is worth it anyways. Definitely would go here again because of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers after a nightshift and the food was delicious. I had build your own omelette with a side of grits. The omelette was very good, the grits were okay but nothing special. The mimosas were delicious, cost about $7 and were worth it. Great place and we will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I was in the Ballantyne area visiting from San Francisco, CA when I stumbled upon this cafe. OH MY!  I don't think there's enough or even the right words in the English dictionary to be able to describe the delectable flavors of this incredibly tasty restaurant. I ate there FOUR times while I was in the area.   I has the following (not necessarily in this order): - Salted Caramel Mocha with soy milk - Coffee shops of the west coast (specifically SF) please contact the chef for the recipe and let me when you get it! This would replace my beloved long term addiction to Peets Coffee. And that's saying something! If you like salted caramel and chocolate and coffee, this is a drink worth trying.  - S'mores French Toast - I don't think I could ever get this again since it was too sweet for me but despite that, I felt like I was sitting around a camp fire enjoying s'mores. Take a  trip back to childhood and try this treat.  - Garlic Hummus - Had this with co-workers and while we all really enjoyed it, we all agreed it wasn't that garlicky.  - Fennel Pollen Dusted Grouper - This was incredibly good! Although I wish there was a bit more asparagus on the plate but I am sure that's my California self showing.   If you want to take a journey with your tastebuds, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Wow, is all that I can say!   I visited here while on a long flight layover in Charlotte.  I journeyed here based on Yelp reviews and I'm glad that I did.   I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Pasta with a side of fried green tomatoes.  My daughters ordered the crabcake benedict and pancakes.   Everything was fresh and DELICIOUS!   The fried green tomatoes were nice breaded and seasoned and not at all greasy, served with a remoulade sauce and pimento cheese (yum!).  The pasta was prepared perfectly, large shrimp, al dente pasta, wilted spinach and diced tomato.  My daughters enjoyed their entrees, including the side of cheese grits and hashbrown patty that accompanied their meals.  We shared the bourbon pecan tart with vanilla ice cream which was absolutely divine!!!"}
{"text":"Location: 4/5 Located in the Piedmont shopping plaza, close to the South Park Mall. There's a lot of other restaurants there like Taco Mac so parking can take a little effort sometimes.   Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3.5/5 Pretty simple. Think American diner decor, not too dated or contemporary but not really modern.   Cleanliness: 4.5/5 No complaints. The establishment was pretty well maintained. Minus the RSVP buzzers. I think a couple of them were broken so the host/hostess had to come outside and yell out the names of the parties a couple of times. Not a big deal.  Service: 5/5 Our waiter was really attentive and nice. Water was refilled and orders were taken promptly even with a full house.  Food: 5/5 Biscuit and Gravy - Phenomenal. I mean super delicious. You can get a half order for $3. It's well worth it. (Southern Fried) Chicken and (Red Velvet) Waffle - The potential diabetes is well worth it. I kid. This sweet, savory waffle is amazingly delicious and the perfect combination for the tender chicken breast. A filling brunch for the fat kid in all of us."}
{"text":"Standard line up of foods.  I've been here for business breakfast and lunch.  Nothing exceptional, but ok"}
{"text":"This place is finger licking good. A very nice setting and the food us very good! Portions seen to be big. The red velvet pancakes are a must have!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and enjoy the food and service. The only complaint is that when the restaurant is packed the tables feel very close together."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The wait can be quite long but it's so worth it. The red velvet waffles are everything and I highly suggest the sausage and gravy. I have never been disappointed when I come here. Luckily there's 2 Charlotte locations but so hoping they would consider a third in North Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great healthy and flavorful options. I need to remember that brrrrr its always cold in there. Pretty noisy for a business lunch but I always end up havng biz lunches here. Must be the killer service and breakfast all day options!"}
{"text":"Their bloody marys have bacon!  I love Terrace Cafe for brunch on the weekends! If you love egg benedict dishes you have to try this place. The florentine is my favorite, but they also have a benedict with fielt medallions! Some of their specials include salmon benedict and crab cake benedict. Make sure to let them know how you like your eggs poached...Sometimes they'll come out a little too done."}
{"text":"I'm happy.  This is the first time I had breakfast and now can couple that experience with the many lunches and some dinners here.  All experiences were good.  This is a cafe with a full bar.  Nothing fancy, but it is comfortable with a good menu.  The breakfast was basic with some nice spins.  I had a three egg, must have been small eggs at that, omelet with hash browns and toast.  Juice.  The omelet was just fine, but small and the hash-browns were outstanding rounds of crispiness on both sides.  Bravo!  The surprise spin was strawberry jam, which I first thought was a form of ketchup.  I don't like strawberry jam, but tried this guy and it was terrific.  Just mushed up strawberries with just enough lemon and sweetener to bring out their best.  I must say that I inhaled that jam on a piece of rye bread and it was like dessert.  The waitress, Melanie, told me that they have some other home made jams that they rotate each week or so.  Last week I missed blueberry mango.  Yes, I sure did.  My wife and I especially like their lunches.  Menu has great plates, salads and sandwiches and all meals have fried green tomatoes available.  Dinner menu is not too different from lunch, just a few other main plates.  Nice atmosphere, good for first dates, business meals and simply a place to get fed and have a few drinks...perhaps.  They do a good job and you will like the flatware, glassware and plates. You will see."}
{"text":"I looooove brunch food. Usually our weekends I find myself at the stove making eggs with goat cheese and chives, but today I wanted to be lazy and have the hubby take me out. So we ended up at terrace cafe. From the outside it looks like a small store type place but the indoors is huge with an upstairs loft like feel! We had to wait a few mins so I got a mocha royal espresso athe bar and the huuby got the bloody mary! They were pricey but very yum. Once we were seated, hubby ane I quickly decided on shrimp and grits for him and the full breakfast (eggs, bacon, pancakes, hash browns) for me. The shrimp and grits were phenomanal. I might get the next time. My breakfast was good too....you can't really go wrong with the classics. The star on my plate was definitely the pancakes. Sooo good. All in all a good brunch experience but the drinks are a lil pricey for the size. Will be going back to try other meals."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend a few times now and it is officially confirmed... 5 stars. If you want mind blowing breakfast this is the place. Be ready for a wait on the weekends. The word is out that this place is good because there is always a crowd. Our waitress was great too!! Ask for Savanna she was quick and accurate and always smiling and made our experience all the better! Try the stuffed French toast! Wow!!!"}
{"text":"First time here getting breakfast.  Really good!! Loved the three egg mushroom and tomato omelette.  My wife had the scrambled eggs, pancakes, etc.  Loved the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Very good food, good service.  Value, not so well.  Every item I've had there has been of really good quality, but I always seem to come away with a feeling of paying too much for too little.  I'm a guy who likes to eat (uggg, dieting now) and when I find good food I like to have it in decent quantities, I didn't feel like I was getting enough.  Example: I had their burger and fries.  The burger WAS of a decent size, but the fries, not so much.  I work in PTC so this is a place I can walk to, but to be honest, I don't go here for lunch anymore.  The one exception:  Morning coffee/breakfast biscuit $5 takeout special, was a big biscuit with whatever you want in it and a decently sized cup of coffee.  Update 10/28/2013 - I'm growing to like this place more and more, based solely on the above mentioned takeout special.  I get it, this place caters to folks who want a more upscale breakfast, and by all accounts, they deliver.  Their offering of the value breakfast makes the value proposition more."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Lots of different options including breakfast for any meal! The interior is nothing exciting but the service and food is always on point. Definitely a great spot for any meal."}
{"text":"Service friendly and quick  Atmosphere light but a little noisy.   I had the BLT on sourdough which is a favorite of mine.  I also had the grits that were warm and good and fried green tomatoes. They weren't as good as moms but were very good.   I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, it was for a Yelp event and at the time I felt the restaurant was five star potential. The service was on point and the food was good. However upon revisiting the restaurant a few weeks later, I can't say I can stand by that initial review. I think the first time I was there the restaurant was ready and was in stage. They had everything prepared. But that's not the way life is. My blended review would be to say the restaurant is a three star. I say that because on top of the wait, it took us forever to get our food. We sat there for 40 minutes with no food in sight. When the food did come out, the avocado put on one of the plates for garnish was rotten. Most of our food were luke warm and the service just want present. I might try this place again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  Great menu (breakfast served all day).  Nice decor and cool upstairs seating.  Lots of variety on the menu.  The eggs florentine perfectly cooked poached eggs, breakfast casserole was delicious with a little kick to it, but not spicy. Service was attentive and not intrusive.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The good: Chicken & apple sausage. Yum! The bad: VERY limited gluten free options. The waitress wasn't willing to work with me. I ended up ordering off the a la carte menu. How difficult would it be to add a plate with eggs + protein + fruit/side."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a late Sunday morning.. There was a long wait (we expected that)... We started out with a Bacon Bloody Mary which was pretty good... After reading all the reviews about the red velvet waffle, I just had to try it. And... I was not that impressed. The waiter told me to try it without syrup which was what I did, it was on the dry side, and not that flavorful. Overall, it was ok."}
{"text":"The wait to be seated for brunch on Sundays can be long, but well worth the wait! I was one of a party of five and we purposely ordered a little of everything on the menu, so we could all sample one anothers' food.   From the red velvet waffle, to the butter pecan waffle with pieces of banana mixed in the actual waffle, to lemon poppy seed french toast topped with fresh fruit, to fried chicken, to chicken sausage, to fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese, to biscuits, to  cheese grits - EVERYTHING was perfectly prepared and taste sooo good!  Don't even think about eating modestly if coming here! Prepare to pig out and to have your taste buds awakened!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got the lettuce wraps and bf got the omelette..nothing to write home about.  Service was MEH...but the one saving grace of this restaurant is the red velvet waffle...no syrup is needed with the cream cheese frosting drizzle. So moist yet crunchy I fell in love. Delish!!  I do give this restaurant \"props\" for it's vegetarian options."}
{"text":"TRY THE RED VELVET WAFFLE AND FRIED CHICKEN!!! This was my first go at at chicken and waffles in the south and I may be ruined for life. I would have licked my plate if I thought people wouldn't stare.  We got seated immediately and our waitress was super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Today was my second time eating here, and there will definitely be future occasions when I do so.  I normally like to go to a new place every time but this place is so tasty that I decided a return visit was in order.  On my first trip I ordered the monte cristo, which they cut into six small pieces and is simply outstanding.  Today I had the chicken and waffle, which was excellent.  The chicken was very juicy and the waffle is above average.  The coffee is very tasty, and the service is excellent.  My roommate ordered the shrimp and grits which were lovely, and today she had the biscuits and gravy, which were creamy doughy goodness.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Might just be one of the best breakfasts I've had in my entire life. Everything about our meal was pure passion. My woman had the chicken and red velvet waffles (so good I always had an orgasm) I had the chef's skillet and lemon poppy French toast which put me in heaven"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend a few days ago. There was a bit of a wait (~20 min for a table for 2) but it was absolutely worth it. The menu is really big and included options for vegetarians, which I really enjoyed. The place itself was really nice and the service was splendid. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles which he LOVED and I had an omelette which was amazing as well. If you can ask for the biscuit, which was one of the best parts of my breakfast, simply deeeeeelisssshus."}
{"text":"This place! There were 3 of us in our Saturday brunch party, and we had a 15 minute wait around 1130 am. NOTE - they take reservations, but not for weekends.  We chose this Piedmont location - great area, not too crowded, and free garage parking literally next to the restaurant.   The place has a super cute, classy feel to it. There are 2 stories, and we were seated upstairs.   My sister got their stuffed French toast and it was unbelievable. Slightly crispy on the outside, soft otherwise, and the filling was delicious. My other sister tried the red velvet chicken and waffles - the waffle was one of the best red velvet waffles I've tried - drizzled to perfection with cream cheese.    I tried the Nasheville hot chicken with the sauce on the side! The chicken was a large, boneless piece and the sauce was perfect - not overly spicy, but definitely with a kick to it. I switched out my side to fries which were probably twice fried, but that much tastier, too!  Service was great and quick! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This was a super disappointment from all of the rage I have heard. Service was slow and your could see multiple employees eating Doritos behind our table \"hiding.\" I was super embarrassed when I brought guests from Raleigh here. I had spoke about how great this place looked. The food tasted like something we could have gotten at Denny's. The hash browns were cold with no flavor or salt. My biscuit was burnt on the bottom and very dry. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday at 10:30am. Was not worth the wait at all."}
{"text":"Led astray by The Charlotte Agenda and Yelp. This place was mediocre at best.   Unremarkable food and drink: Flavorless but expensive mimosa, bland crab cake eggs benedict, fine fried green tomatoes. My friend found the shrimp and grits less than edible. Just-okay cheese grits, but The Flying Biscuit has spoiled me there.   Slow and spotty service: We stood in the middle of the restaurant while our hostess checked tables after she already told us to follow her. They were out of Splenda. Didn't bring my coffee until the end of the meal, and had to ask three times for it -- and then again for cream.   Why would people eat here? I don't get it. Sorry I subjected my friends to this subpar brunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place for brunch when he looked up terrace cafe.  I am not big on breakfast foods and was not all to thrilled.  He insisted so we went.  LITERALLY BLEW MY MIND! Everything was delicious from the drinks to the food.  My Bloody Mary was the best thing I have ever tasted,  the peanut butter latte was so delcious we ordered two.  The red velvet waffle was amazing and the steak and eggs we scrumptous! We also ordered brushetta and I highly recommend you doing the same.  The service was also great and friendly.  I will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like to give a place at least 3 chances before I rate them. This place looks and feels nice but the food is worth maybe a third of what they charge for it. Yesterday I paid $15 for runny oatmeal and thin little pieces of Turkey bacon. I've had sandwiches, grits, and of course, on my first visit, the doughy overhyped subpar red velvet waffles. I barely ate half of it, along with a runny omelet. I don't know what all the hype is about. The staff isn't even that great. On a positive note, the food usually looks really good."}
{"text":"Three of us ate brunch here Sunday afternoon.  We came in and were told the wait would be 45 minutes. We waited about 30 minutes to get seated because many people on the wait list had left.  When we were sat we all ordered waters and one person ordered the house Bloody Mary.  Waters came out quickly but the Bloody Mary took about 10 minutes.  When it came out it had no garnish and looked lack luster.  We ordered our food, a Monte Cristo and two chicken sandwiches.  I was really excited about the Monte Cristo because I used to get one at another restaurant but it was taken off their menu.  The chicken sandwiches were described as served with skillet potatoes.  We waited close to 30 minutes for our food.  When it came out they told us it would be a few extra minutes for the skillet potatoes.  My Monte Cristo was so salty it was almost inedible.  The hash browns that came with it lacked any flavor and were more like the consistency of mash potatoes.  The chicken sandwiches were okay at best.  The skillet potatoes came out and also lacked flavor and were sitting in oil.  When the bill came there was an extra dollar charge for the skillet potatoes...that were described as served with the sandwich...and came out late...When we asked about the charge the answer we got was yes they come with the sandwich but there is an extra charge.  Needless to say we were very underwhelmed and will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on our first trip to Charlotte before we moved here on a recommendation from a friend. The food was excellent and I can't wait to go back and try the red velvet waffle!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I am picky with omlets but loved mine with spinach mushrooms bacon and scallions. Also we had the red velvet waffle, strawberry stuffed,French toast and sausage and cheese grits. Haha favorite was the fresh sausage and cheese grits. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This was a very poor experience. The menus clearly stated drink specials but manager refused to honor. We have eaten at the Ballantyne location and it's always been good but food here was mediocre at best. All the salad dressings were like custard and the waiter said there was something wrong but never offered to change out meal. Kids meal clearly stated milk was included but charged extra because chocolate milk was ordered.  Worst part was when we told manager about issue with drink price, charging extra for chocolate milk and the salad dressings being bad he could care less.  Being a business owner I would never let a person like him deal with my customers let alone be in charge! Now it makes sense why place was empty while restaurants all around it were busy!"}
{"text":"Great food and coffee nice interior and employees"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast/brunch place. Be fair warned that its pretty crowded and we had to wait a good 30 minutes be seated at noon on a Sunday. The food was delicious and the service was good as well. Overall I was pleased."}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the omelet and chicken sausage. The coffee cake was awesome!  Our server went above and beyond.  Thank you Joan!"}
{"text":"The food here was great! We had their renowned red velvet waffle with fried chicken and Canadian bacon eggs Benedict. The only complaint was the service, it took a while to get seated -so we stood at the door for a couple of minutes-."}
{"text":"Wait was longer than we were quoted, but food was all as good as we had hoped for. Hubby had the red velvet waffle with fried chicken and loved it. I had the steak and eggs and it was cooked perfectly. Our server was fantastic and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Wonderful - French toast was perfect. Only complaint is no butter margarine was used."}
{"text":"During the Holiday season, my family and I enjoyed an amazing meal at Terrace Cafe.  It was my second visit there and I was so excited to take my girls back for a treat.  As with my first visit, the food was phenomenal and the service matched the food.  Our table was well represented with egg dishes and sweet bites...two orders of veggie omelet, a California Waffle, and Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes.  The coffee is good and the wait staff was on stand-by for refills.  This was a great way to spend some quality family time together."}
{"text":"Get to Terrace Cafe stat if you are a professional brunch'er life myself.  The brunch was delicious.    I've actually been to Terrace Cafe twice.  The first time I got the signature red velvet waffle and chicken.  It was mediocre at best.  Nothing special about the waffle and the breading of the chicken came off as soon as you cut it.  I hate that!  So fast forward to six mos later and my brunch crew decided to go to Terrace.  I was like cool - I hear folks rave about it, lemme give it a 2nd shot.  The french toasts are awesome.  We all got different kinds.  Mine was by far the best.  It was the seasonal pumpkin.  The lemon poppy seed was good, but a little dry.  They have removed the banana nut french toast from the menu.   We inquired about it and were told it was gone, followed by our server saying \"everyone asks about it.\"  So why would they remove something so popular.    So why is this place not 5 stars?  Well I can't forget the mediocre first experience.  I also hate  'no reservations' and the fact that they won't seat you until your whole party is there.  I have a perpetually late girlfriend.  4 of us arrived and waited, and waited and waited...they would not seat us until the 5th got there.  That is an annoyance.  I can understand why, but they'd rather leave those booths empty then seat us.  Here's why I say that.  When girlfriend finally arrived we were seated upstairs in the only tables (booths actually) that could accommodate more then 4 people...well all of the booths were empty.  So my question is why 'hold' them and make us wait in the coffee bar.  Did they think we were lying about having the 5th person?  It just didn't make sense and was irritating.  They also got one of the orders wrong.  Service seemed frazzled. We never had the same server twice actually."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have breakfast - from their eggs Benedict to the famous red velvet waffle, everything is delicious and up to par!  I'm not a fan of their grits, but to each his own. This place definitely gets four stars! Atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Definitely a great eat in the South Park area!"}
{"text":"Went there about 3 years ago and it was awesome! Back this weekend and it was Dennys on an smaller location and with higher prices. Service was bad. Empty glasses and dishes were never picked. Zero attention to detail and food quality and taste were not what we remembered from our first visit."}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the BEST breakfast I have ever had in my life!  It has such a hustle and bustle vibe, but not one that stresses you out.  The restaurant itself is warm and inviting, and you can tell that it's owned by good people.  Regarding breakfast, they have a full coffee bar with a bunch of delicious lattes on the menu!  They also have a fun and exciting food menu that has a little (or a lot) for everyone.  There are traditional plates and some that burst with flavor!  I was also really impressed that many things are made in house, like their sausage.  It was delicious!  You may need to wait before you get a table, but gosh it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is one of the best brunch spots in Charlotte, the wait will be long, but it's WORTH IT. My last three visits I have ordered the banana nut French toast, with extra bananas... I'm not sure why the extra bananas part is so complicated but it hasn't been right any time I've ordered. I've been requesting that the bananas be cooked with the French toast and topped with the syrup dressing, but this just hasn't been the case. I probably will stop ordering this dish but there are plenty others on the menu that will make this brunch experience great."}
{"text":"Delicious food - Great Service at BOTH locations.  Breakfast ROCKS"}
{"text":"We came during Sunday Brunch. It was pretty packed. We got seated upstairs, and this was actually my second time here at Terrace. After hearing my parents rave about this place, we decided to go with them and sadly it wasn't the best.  The food was alright, but what really brought our visit down was the service. We literally saw the waitress three times the whole time we were there.  Once to ask for drinks, second for the order, and last for getting our bill. Literally no service at all.   The funny thing was that upstairs, you can sort of see what staff is doing... And let's just say our waiter was having her phone out, watching videos, and distracting other waiters of doing their job...seems like having a grand ol' time. I mean, who wouldn't like that? Go to work, only work a little... And then get tipped? I still tipped, but nothing like what I usually tip.  For food, I got the breakfast casserole. I thought it wasn't bad, but felt like it was missing maybe a sauce as it was a little dry on the outside. Maybe a gravy? I don't know. It was missing something I felt. It came with ketchup, but it didn't fulfill what was missing. It came out like a block straight from a casserole dish, which was what I was expecting, but then when you bit into it... it just tasted dry."}
{"text":"Don't know if it was a particular rough day or normal brunch.  Based on other reviews it seems like they are always busy so that doesn't explain the bartender that had a meltdown while we were waiting to order. He actually threw a lime. Service was great once seated.  Food came out luke-warm and needed seasoning.  Then again prefer that to over-salted.  Might give it another try or maybe not given the many other options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am going to start off by saying my experience today was one for the books. The restaurant was very busy so expected to have a longer wait than normal but thats all I expected. Unfortunately that was just the beginning of a bad experience. Our server took our order (Biscuits & Gravy w/ Loaded hash browns and Filet Eggs Benedict). Asked two times for waters still none. Finally the meals come out about 30 min later and my egg yolks already broken w/ English muffin soggy mess served Luke warm. To make things worse the Biscuits & Gravy were cold! Got ahold of mgmt since our server had not checked back in on us since taking order almost 45 min ago...  Matthew Thompson(Asst General Mgr) was very responsive and corrected the situation with a smile - giving us hope again. The food came out hot this time but was missing all the loaded part to our hash browns. He informed us would fix it on the bill and we were happy without it; just too hungry at this point. The food was averaged and felt it lacked flavor - wasn't impressed at all.   This next part is what pushed me over the \"edge\" to write this review. The General Manager (yes head boss) treated me with such lack of respect as a human let alone a customer of his. I asked him for our check for our server was missing. He handed it to me and I informed him of the issue and the loaded toppings on the hash browns needed to be removed (over $7 charge - no biggie but when told they would felt like it should be done) he then looks at the receipt and say $39 I got this (rude sassy tone) and rips the receipt in my face! The server, hostess and busback couldn't believe  what just happened. I was so taken back I just walked away, got my family and left. I will never never be returning to an establishment that feels it OK to disrespect a customer like that."}
{"text":"This was my first brunch experience in Charlotte and it has yet to be topped. I was really in the mood for some hot chocolate and it was perfection.   We were waiting for a table, but ended up getting lucky and sat at one of the bar tables. I don't think I've ever had a better waiter. He was so attentive, gave us amazing recommendations and genuinely wanted to make sure that we had the best dining experience.   On top of the amazing service the food was delicious. We had the quiche, pancakes, eggs, hash browns, and bacon. Everything was amazing, especially the quiche! I would recommend this place to anyone and often do!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way to IHOP when I said let's try something different. I want real breakfast and a real dining experience. The Terrace Cafe didn't disappoint. We found it by doing a google search and said anything beats IHOP. I had the shrimp and grits, my daughter had the egg omelet and my husband had the steak and eggs and we all shared the red velvet waffle which was especially light and yummy! HANDS down one of the best restaurants we have been to since we moved to Charlotte 6 months ago."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a coworker. The reviews on yelp and the unique menu selection is what enticed me to try this place out.  The service was good - they seated us right away.  I ordered the infamous red velvet waffles.  They were a little too sweet for my taste, but good.   The atmosphere was homely feeling. It was small, quaint, and nicely decorated.   I would recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. If I'm in the area again, I would revisit this place."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience here today. Our server was rude and very inattentive. The food was not hot and was not good. While ordering we asked the waitress if they used shell eggs or powdered eggs and she claimed they used real eggs. It was obvious that the eggs were some type of egg beater/powder as the consistency was not those of real eggs. I would not recommend or return to Terrace Cafe. Our waitress was Carley."}
{"text":"Back again as tradition would have it. In town for the Charlotte Cup and the customary celebration feast of coach with competitors.  I am here annually and this time I ordered  just the chicken and red velvet waffle while my company tried buttermilk waffle, lemon poppyseed french toast and shrimp and grits. I could see a few modifications were made on the dishes like the addition of hush puppies and reduction of spicy gravy. Our server was pleasant and service was on point until the food came and my company kept ducking because the food was passed around across our faces and servers reached over our plates instead of around us to the left or even from behind. You lost a star for that because it was obvious we were getting annoyed."}
{"text":"While on our roadtrip back home from Boone, NC we decided to stop in Charlotte for a good breakfast and may I say I was soo pleased with the search results on Yelp. We decided on Terrace Cafe and everyone in my family was pleased with their meal. My husband ordered the eggs benedict with crab meat, although he didnt say much his silence and facial expressions said it all, oh the fact that the plate was clean within minutes. My kids shared and devoured the full breakfast,  which was definitely a full breakfast;  scrambled eggs, bacon,  hash brown and 2 pancakes. And I had the chance to try their Belgian Waffles with fresh fruit which were so delicious, fluffy, fresh, warm and not too sweet. To add to our experience our waitress was very nice and helpful. Oh and service was very quick, we must've received our food within 10 minutes,  which I thought was awesome, especially when you're with a toddler full of morning energy."}
{"text":"Thought it was pretty good.  First time going here after I had heard a lot of great things so I suppose my expectations were pretty high.  That being said I wasn't compelled to come back here with haste.  I had the Chicken and waffles which I found to be just okay.  I did enjoy the mocha though and the also thought the biscuits were above average.  Also kind of expensive for breakfast food, but I'd be happy to pay if it was worth it.  Probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Coffee is a 5-star. Service solid. Nice place.  Breakfast very good. Had an omelet which was well prepared with good ingredients. Very tasty. The hash browns were the ordinary shredded potatoes without much flavor. The toast was dry. For a place with an interesting menu with things like a red velvet waffle and shrimp and grits, the sides served with my omelet weren't up to par. The place has a lot of awards displayed around their doors and a large group of regulars that come for takeout before work. The staff knew their standard orders and prepared them quickly for these folks on the way to work. All in all, the coffee, atmosphere and service will keep me coming back but I will avoid the ordinary sides and order the more unique items off the menu."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service could not have been better.  We went on a Saturday and were seated quickly at the bar.  The chicken and waffle was great.  We also had the shrimp and grits and the red velvet waffle as well.  Each were wonderful.  The accompanying chicken breast is moist and delicious. If I lived in Charlotte, NC this would be my new favorite place for breakfast / brunch."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Terrace Cafe last Sunday. I'm glad we got there early ( 9 am ) as a long line was waiting when we left.  Food was delicious and so much that we could not finish.  We 4 should have only ordered 1 order of fried green tomatoes instead of 2.  We had 4 different items and they were all great.  Service was also excellent.  I would definitely return.  French press coffee was not as good as I would have thought  but that's probably because we did not wait long enough.  Also it gets cold quick in that glass pot."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte visiting and a group of us went here for breakfast and it was great.  The resteraunt is in a nice location and the staff was friendly.  The food was excellent and everything was very fresh also the fried green tomatos are worth a try!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place! It was my first time, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes cute restaurants with good food.  The Good:  1) It's a great location! I am staying at the Doubletree Hilton Southpark and it was maybe a 5 minute drive. I had considered walking, but the forecast called for rain. I don't know why people complained about parking. Yeah, I had to drive to the fourth level of the parking garage, but it was completely free. Especially given the area, the parking situation was great.   2) Decor. It had a cute feel. There was a chalkboard with drinks listed which was cute. I love chalkboards. Also, I sat at the top level over looking the restaurant, so I was able to look at everybody's food and drinks before I ordered.  3) Food. The most important part! It was extremely hard to decide what to eat because I wanted everything (in part because I'm visiting from upstate NY where you can't find chicken and waffles, grits, biscuits and gravy, etc). I decided on the red velvet waffle with chicken, a side of fruit, and a half order of biscuits n gravy. I loved the waffle! It had cream cheese frosting on it. Not much, just enough for sweetness. I didn't even add syrup. The chicken was a little dry, but it had great flavor and was very crunchy. The biscuit and gravy was good. It wasn't salty, but was creamy, the biscuit was fluffy, it was just nice. The fruit was ok.  4) Service. The hostess was nice. I called before  I came, and the hostess was helpful with all my questions. My waiter was just ok. He didn't seem too happy to be there, but he did take back the one item I didn't like (lemonade) and didn't charge me. I will say, though, he was a lot nicer than many other waiters I've encountered in this area.  The Bad:  1) The Lemonade- Since I've been visiting NC this week, I've had much of my favorite fast food, Chick fil A. That being said, the bar is pretty high for lemonade, especially at the price they're charging for it. I expected a fresh squeezed lemonade with real sugar, but I think it was some kind of mix, maybe Minute Maid. It went back.  2) Cupcake Latte- They had several flavors, including Peanut Butter Cup latte, but I've never had cupcake flavor so I went for it. It was plain. It just tasted like a really sweet latte. I'll pass.  3) Dessert- Yeah, I had dessert too (but I got it to go, don't judge!) I got the pineapple upside down cake, which has a layer of cheesecake in the middle. It came cold, which is fine since I was taking it and could heat it later. It's good, and really sweet. The pineapples on top are amazing. But it was $7 for a small slice. Not that I needed a lot, I just feel like it's overpriced.  For the red velvet waffle with chicken and side of fruit, biscuit and gravy side, pineapple upside down cake, and cupcake latte, I paid $31. Not too bad I guess. I really liked the place, so I'd go again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for at least four years, this place is a hidden gem in South Park, the food is always fresh and delicious, breakfast is the best, on weekends it can get busy in the mornings, the service is superb, never had a disappointing meal here, he menu has plenty to choose from. Their omelette is really good, try the spinach and feta cheese. French toast variety is ample, yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Went on a thursday at noon and it was pleasantly crowded.  I had the special, which was red pepper pasta with scallops, and it was heaven!  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  My dining companions loved their lunch as well, the crab cake blt, and the lemon chicken.  I really wanted the spicy bloody mary, but had to go to work, so the waiter brought me a taste of the mix.  It was great, spicy, but not too spicy.  Will be back to have this drink at some point.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"So, it's a Saturday morning and I'm in the kitchen making over-easy eggs accompanied by toast, baby tomatoes and fresh basil and my boyfriend in the living room says, \"you're cooking? I thought we could go to brunch.\" Oh... okay. I never say no to brunch so stopped in my tracks and plated the \"breakfast appetizers,\" considering it a good idea since any good breakfast place in Charlotte seems to have a 20-30 minutes wait.  I was right. We drove down to South Park and put our name in (30 minute wait, as anticipated) and decided to do a little shopping at the Container Store while we waited. We're getting pretty good at fitting errands into dining based on location. Anyway, once 25-30 minutes had gone by we headed back to Terrace, where the hostess was ready to take us to our table. Perfect timing! We were seated upstairs overlooking the restaurant and ordered coffee and fresh orange juice. I had the shrimp and grits (I'm becoming quite the southerner) and we shared a side of the red velvet waffles... OMG. Both were so amazing. I'm not even a waffle person when I brunch, but these were stellar. Also, give me something cajun with a side of okra and I'm a happy girl- big fan of Terrace's shrimp and grits. I left full but surprisingly not feeling TOO full- we still had a lot of errands to run that day. Oh, Saturdays!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying this, if you are in a group of 5+ you will wait a while to get sat. Why you say? Let me explain. As we are in town for Memorial day weekend our friends decided to come check this place out, so we just decided to tag along. Get there and wait is already at an hour- hour and a half, which by Atlanta standards is ok to me, so we decided to wait. An hour goes by, nothing, so my friends decide to check with the hostess about 1:15 of us waiting, just to see where we were, to her replying \"you still have 15 minutes left to wait\"? Huh? What? Isn't that estimated time just an exaggerated amount for us to wait? Or plain leave so you don't have to deal with a large party? As you can tell, the mood slowly started going down hill, and attitudes started flaring. Now, i'm no stranger to waiting, but to tell me how much time i still have to wait? Were you trying to seat us or no? Either way, right at 1hour and 35mins we get called and proceeded to get sat down. Mind you, tons of groups went ahead of us. Either way, we started placing our order to a waitress that couldn't seem to focus, kept looking at us and paying attention to the next table, which she stopped in the middle of us giving her the order to go help the next table, and then coming back. Huh?? Moving on, 35 mins later we got our food; i got the Monte Cristo which was actually pretty good, nice twist with the french toast. Paired with that was some coffee, which I could have been better off with. Tasted more like gas station coffee. At this prices why not have top notch ingredients? Lastly, we paid and got out as quickly as we could. If you have about 2.5hrs to blow just waiting and to quickly eat then this is the place. I don't think i'll make the effort into coming here again. Educate that staff with better customer service practices."}
{"text":"Popping into Terrace cafe during the early afternoon lull on a Saturday was (and is) a good decision. Previous reviews and co-worker experience frequently mentioned THE WAIT during peak breakfast/brunch hours. Thankfully, Terrace serves breakfast all day and I can eat breakfast any time of the day so being there during 'normal' brunch hours really doesn't mean much to me.  We were greeted by multiple staff members and seated immediately upon arrival. We were informed of the drink and food specials of the day and I decided to start off with a glass of pineapple-guava sangria. OHMYYUM. I inhaled this drink, it was so good. I wish I had written down the ingredients in order to recreate it at home...and I wish the glass was bigger.  I had a hard time deciding between the eggs benedict and omelet options so I decided to get some helpful advice from the friendly (and patient!) waiter Ian. I ended up going with the crab cake eggs benedict on a biscuit - per Ian's advice - with hash browns.   While I waited for the food to arrive, I took a peek at the other diners' meals and everyone else (well, it wasn't that many people) was ordering breakfast, usually one of the waffle dishes.   The eggs benedict was delicious! The crab cakes were meaty and the biscuit was a nice touch. I opted for the hollandaise sauce on the side and that was good too. The hash browns were crispy and came out already seasoned with salt + pepper.  This probably had a lot to do with the time of day that I visited but service was so well-paced and friendly. Oh as a random aside, I noticed that they keep stevia in the raw packets on the tables. I happen to use stevia in the raw on a daily basis for my everyday coffee so seeing it available at Terrace made me irrationally happy.  Terrace cafe was delicious and I really enjoyed my time dining there. I cannot wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"I had the intention on going here and ordering the chicken and waffles... as soon as I saw they offered a RED VELVET waffle, my mind was made up. Red velvet waffles and friend chicken... weird? NOPE! It's a match made in heaven. I got a side of cheese grits and turkey bacon and cleaned basically every crumb off my plate. Also, do not get me started with their chai latte. Absolutely amazing. I swear I still have dreams about my meal, MUST come back very soon. Great service and even better food!!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but my last few visits to Terrace Cafe have just been ok... certainly not worthy of the 5 stars I gave them a couple of years ago.  During today's breakfast visit, the fella and I sat at the bar. Our server was kind of arrogant and yet didn't know what was in the Berry Split I ordered (my usual). Thankfully, another server overheard him and corrected him. It also took him forever to bring our check, and we finally had to stop him and ask for it since he was too busy talking to the other 3 guys behind the bar.  When I got the Berry Split, it was literally half the size it used to be. There was one, small dollop of yogurt and maybe one banana split in half. Sprinkle on a tiny bit of granola and fruit, and that was it. However, they certainly didn't lower the price; it was still $11! The fella ordered a small OJ, which was $3.50 and maybe 8 ounces. Yikes. His benedict and grits were fine, but there just wasn't anything stellar on this visit or our last few. Pretty disappointing since this used to be my hands-down favorite breakfast in town."}
{"text":"We came for Saturday brunch. Service upstairs was horrible. Looking down it seems that the downstairs service were on point.  The upstairs servers were looking at a video on our server's cell phone, joking around in the kitchen area by the stairs. Our water was never refilled. Coffee was refilled once (it was also cold) by the team leader (I think since she had an earpiece).  We saw our server at our table three times: when she took our drink order, when she gave our drinks and got our food order, and when she finally gave our check. I think we could have just walked out and not pay and no one would notice.    Thinking back to my food, I didn't realize my order was incomplete. I ordered the Southern style Benedict with the optional sausage gravy. The gravy was missing."}
{"text":"Super cute, well decorated restaurant. Was more upscale and put together than typical breakfast places without the stuffiness. Had a cute upstairs seating area as well that overlooked the bottom level. There was also a small bar area too. The parking deck was right beside the restaurant and provided easy parking and access to the restaurant. Also appreciated that they text you when your table is ready.   FOOD:    I got the spicy chicken biscuit with hash browns (I added the peppers and onions to mine for $1 extra). And it was okay. The biscuit was awkwardly large and crumbly to eat like a typical biscuit, would have been better suited as an open face dish. But the flavors were good, was a little spicier than I had anticipated. My boyfriend ordered the full breakfast and absolutely LOVED it. He isn't a huge pancake person but said those were some of the best pancakes that he had ever had!  SERVICE:    The two hostesses at the front were very friendly and gave a very good first impression. Our waitress was nice, and did a good job. Nothing over the top. The manager did come over and check on things, which is always a nice touch. I feel that the manager coming around isn't as common anymore.   OVERALL:   It was a nice, enjoyable breakfast. Will we be back? Yes! Will I order the same thing? No, it was good just not amazing and would like to try some of their signature waffles next time."}
{"text":"Free parking and the garage is RIGHT next door. Friendly, attentive, and wonderful service. Casual, clean, comfortable environment with decent prices on the menu. Food is good, although I can't say much about a belgium waffle and potato hash browns. I wish I tried something more unique to Terrace... I hear the red velvet waffle is one of the most popular... so original! too bad I can't have red velvet."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I went out for a girl's weekend and we all ate off of each others plate everything was so amazing I enjoyed the food thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles!   I totally get the hype of this place, it's very cute with great service and even better food. The waffle was delicious, especially with the soft butter they serve it with. And the fried chicken was surprisingly good-- I'm picky about chicken and am always worried it will be too dry, but this one was really juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm such a foodie when I travel so I love to look for the awesomest creations when I'm out of town.  I was looking for a breakfast spot on yelp and stumbled upon this place, known for their red velvet waffle.  Yes please!  BF arrived here at almost 9am on a Friday and did not have to wait.  We were hoping to be in and out in less than an hour because we had a flight to catch.  Service was quick and on point throughout the meal.  Not only did they have red velvet waffles, but you could also order it with fried chicken!  So of course I had to get the fried chicken n red velvet waffle.  BF ordered an omelet with a side of fried chicken (one thing I love about the South: you can order fried food anytime of day!). My red velvet waffle was topped with cream cheese drizzle which complimented the waffle well.  The fried chicken was mediocre, but still a pleasant meal nonetheless.  There were a lot of other yummy breakfast options on the menu that looked pretty good too.  I may need to come back if I'm ever back in Charlotte for business."}
{"text":"I visited here for brunch on my last trio to NC. The food was great. I had the red velvet chicken and waffles. A delicious take on the brunch favorite. I especially enjoyed the cream cheese glaze. I also tried the shrimp and grits. Pretty good as well. Although I was pleased with the food the service was not very good. The hostesses did not communicate well during the wait and once inside our food took forever. Our waitress only checked on us one time and for some reason they could not take the okra off the shrimp and grits. The lack of service overshadowed the food."}
{"text":"The red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle and fried chicken were amazing! Cheddar grits were so creamy and good. My daughter enjoyed her kid's meal of animal pancakes, bacon and eggs. The restaurant was pretty cold, however. I had long sleeves on and was freezing. Would definitely recommend and plan on going back for the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"I came for breakfast. Let me tell you their shrimp and grits is freaking amazing!! I would definitely come back and try them out for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Gem... You're welcomed by smiling faces and quickly attended by their very friendly  servers ( Maureen, Corrine, Doug and Julie) just to name a few. Of course when they are busy you will have a wait which is well worth it. The menu choices are ample and creative and always satisfying ( Thanks Mark, EC). They are suggestive and always on the money with them. They have consistently fresh ingredients that always come through in whatever you have there. If you happen to be a frequent patron there you will feel welcomed as if you were family and friends each and every single time. Management is present and always checking in on you ( Thanks Mike) and making sure each and every experience is special and a good one for everyone that comes in. Thank you to everyone that makes our experience an AMAZING one every time."}
{"text":"I think everybody in Charlotte already knows how great Terrace Cafe is but I'll still go ahead and remind you. Once again this morning, my breakfast here was 10 out of 10 as well as the restaurant itself and the service.   The food was fresh and it was served very quickly despite how many people that was already there. I had the famous red velvet waffles and chicken, with hash browns. The mimosa was tasted great as well.   All in all, Terrace Cafe is still my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I always have high hopes for brunch. Checking Yelp beforehand, I decided Terrace Cafe would be worth trying. It certainly did not disappoint.  Terrace Cafe is one of the few places that I know of in Charlotte that does brunch on Saturdays. They also don't take reservations, so expect a wait due to its popularity. I went with my boyfriend at 11:40AM on Saturday and were seated within 30 minutes.  Their bloody marys were good. Warning: the Diablo Bloody Mary was very spicy, but the others were of normal intensity. We ordered the shrimp & grits, chocolate chip waffle, and biscuits & gravy. The shrimp & grits was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce they had. The waffle was a good cake-y consistency (I prefer it that way). The biscuits & gravy were to die for. And I've grown up in the south my whole life.   All in all, I had a good experience. Food was good, service was quick and accommodating, and the restaurant had a good vibe to its decor."}
{"text":"DO NOT order takeout from this place. The staff is either incompetent or just have zero regard for ensuring customers get exactly what they are paying for. Twice now we've ordered pick up and both times half the order has been wrong or parts of the order were missing.  Each time, our order was read back to us and was correct.  Not sure if the kitchen staff is illiterate or if no one is capable of doing their due diligence of checking orders COMPLETELY before handing them off to the customer but this will be the last time we waste our money here.   The best part, the manager on duty has zero idea how to handle situations like this. He made no attempt to apologize for us having wasted our time and made no attempt to try to keep us as customers. News flash, what your employees do or don't do in our case, reflects just as much on you as it does them."}
{"text":"I've had fried chicken and waffles before but none like this! The Red Velvet Waffle and Fried Chicken is to die for!!! The chicken is seasoned perfectly and the Waffle isn't too sweet! The eggs and everything else are great too! This brunch spot is a must go to!!"}
{"text":"Love!! Love!! Love!! This place!! The breakfast is amazing no matter what you order. Service is great and so friendly."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for burch!!! I came here for brunch for my bday and it was a great start for my new day :)   First of all, very convenient for parking, as soon as you walk out from the parking lot, and it's on the right hand side!!! This restaurant is way bigger then u thought when I see it from outside, upstairs and down stairs wherever you prefer to sit.  The service was great, the waitress was super friendly and sweet!!   As for the main part- food. So I ordered the red velvet chicken waffle with hash brown , then an egg white vegetable omelet with fresh fruit. I have to say what we ordered were just Perfect!!!! The chicken from the waffle was amazing, so crispy and moist, the waffle was phenomenal, really well done, the fruits were so fresh, egg white omelet just so clean and healthy non greasy!!!! Over all, fresh ingredient and perfect cooking just makes me happy:)))"}
{"text":"Am I in Heaven?  I think I'm in love with this place.  One of my besties' took me to this place for brunch and that's when I fell in love.  Yeah, I went there for the Red Velvet Waffles w/ cream cheese drizzled on top because it sound intriguing but that wasn't the highligh of my experience.    When we walked into this beautiful establishment, I loved the soft and easy low-key tones of the restaurant.  I felt like we were in a movie.  Although it was packed, the ambiance was very relaxing and comforting.  The star of the show for me was definitely the chicken apple sausage (which is made fresh at the restaurant).  It is so delicious that I am still at a loss for words!  It is definitely something that you'd have to try for yourself.  So let me back up a bit,  I ordered the red velvet waffles, chicken apple sausage, and stone ground grits w/ cheese.   Lately, I have to admit, I have not liked anyone's grits besides my own, but let me tell you...if you're craving grits and you don't want to make them yourself--give this place a try.  I personally cannot wait to go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday afternoon and the wait was extremely long which is understandable for after-church. We got a cup of coffee at the bar while we waited, but for 2 black coffees it was almost $6?! That kind of set the tone for what was in store. It was very busy, and the service was pretty good. I got the eggs Benedict and they were okay. Ordered the fried green tomatoes as a side. Not sure what spice/s they use, but no one at our table was a fan. We ended up throwing them away, which I so hate to do. Nothing here makes me want to return, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was AMAZING   No need to think about it...just dine here and savor the taste of perfection"}
{"text":"Great food and delicious cocktails. Had a coffee infused drink how I wanted it! Absolutely delicious! Ordered the full Breakfast.... delicious! Good costmer service and the food came pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Outstanding Chicken & Waffles!   Only weird thing was the alternative music and town square setting.  Service was fantastic.  Serving sufficient to feed my wife with a to go box."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food. No complaints on that. However today, my wife and I decided to meet there for brunch and the customer service was totally off. I got there first, received my buzzer for our table, and waited like everyone else. Cool. 45 minutes later the buzzer goes off because the table is ready. I turn in the buzzer and prepare to be seated, and I let the hostess know that my wife will be here in 10 minutes or less. She says, oh well I'm sorry but we can not seat you until she comes. Wait, what? Yes, you said there was a party of 2 so you have to wait until she gets here. I asked why and she says its policy and gave me the buzzer back. I waited 5 minutes and had to go back up to the desk. I'm trying to understand why I can't sit down. I said look, I've been standing here nearly 45 minutes and I'm ready to sit down. There is not another party of two, and if I said it was just me you would still seat me at a table with at least two chairs! She says well that's our policy and you already told us its a party of two so I'm sorry! She says look behind you you can sit right... Too late someone's there now! By then my wife walks in and I ask for the manager. Surprisingly, the hostess, Tasha says she is the manager! My wife asks where is your manager then. Tasha says oh he's already gone but there is his card, call him! It won't change anything! I said you know what, I'm hungry so let us eat so we can go. I'll just call the owner. She says well his name is Stuart and he lives upstairs! I was pretty pissed and it took everything in me not to be disrespectful back, but once seated we did call the manager Patrick I think. I'm starting to believe maybe she was right because although he apologized and said Tasha was wrong, I don't feel as if it was handled correctly. Very disappointed in this service today! Gotta do better to loyal customers!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I've been busy and I haven't had a chance to do this review like I wanted to.   My boyfriend and I went to Charlotte for a day trip & found this place for a brunch before we hit the road. It was Sunday, therefore we alreeeeady knew it was about to be a wait. What is convenient for this location is that rug parking garage is right next to it. Therefore, if you're with someone, drop them off so they can get a table then park and come back down. For our wait, we did the text message system and I thought that was very savvy. We were told we had to wait 25 minutes. We ended up waiting around 40. It's brunch, what do you expect lol?  I always enjoy looking at the menu prior to me sitting if there's a wait. Like why .. wait to get waited on when you were already waiting. This location had a menu on the outside of the building which helped speed the process up.   As we were waiting I saw that this restaurant had won awards. So in my mind, their bar just raised. When you walk in there was a bar where you can order your fun drinks and pick up your togo orders.   I feel like one of my favorite parts of the restaurant was how we got to sit upstairs. We got to look over the. .. wait for for it. .. TERRACE LOLLLL.   Our waiters name was Brandon. He was pretty cool. While ordering, he actually made me excited for the food. We waited, not very long actually. I ordered banana pecan french toast with a side of hash browns. YES CARBS.   The toast came but I had to wait almost 10 minutes for my hash browns. I was a little disappointed. Why? Because I like eating everything I ordered at ONCE... and well. . I like taking photos of my food & it was missing lol. When I got the hash browns I was little. .. ehh idk. It didn't have annnny type of seasoning. They were bland. The french toast was a yes and my boyfriend didn't have any complaints about his food.   So it's time for us to leave & we needed to use the restrooms. If you have read any of my previous reviews, bathrooms are a big deal for me. To me, they are a reflection on the cleanliness of your kitchen area. An example, yes the kitchen can get chaotic, however for safety concerns, they need to be managed to make sure that the health and safety is kept up. . whaaaaale. . the bathrooms at this location weren't \"everything\".  There was barely any tissue and it was \"placed\" on top of the roller when clearly, you could just place it. .. alright anyway. Stuff was all over the floor, etc. I understand that yes it's brunch, yes it's a weekend, yes it's busy. . however there needs to be someone checking it more often when the traffic is higher in the restaurant.    Overall rating: 3.5.   Pros:  - service, GO Brandon  - atmosphere  - quality of food   Cons: - bathrooms  - prices for side items  - no seasoning on the hash browns - food was \"forgotten\" and had to wait.   I know for a fact that when in the area again, we will be back."}
{"text":"If you have never experienced the red velvet waffle, you should! I have been here a handful of times and am never disappointed with anything that I have gotten! I've had there red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle...its amazingly light and fluffy and so flavorful. I also have had there Eggs benedict florentine. Its so good too, the hollendaise sauce has a whole-grain mustard in it which gives it a unique flavor. And last there bacon bloody mary is wonderful! What's not good with bacon in it... The staff is always friendly and the food never takes a long time. I recommend making a reservation though if you go on the weekend. They get busy, fast! This place is just plain good. I can't wait til I go back again! -SK"}
{"text":"It was good, but I didn't think it was anything special. Was it worth the wait? Not really, but I'm not saying it was horrible. Just not a place I would recommend. On the bright side, our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here, I had the shrimp and grits with a velvet waffle and it was delicious. Our server Julie was also amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly not the biggest fan of the famous velvet waffles, I prefer the breakfast bowls. The brunch food is great and I've eaten here 3 times. Never had any bad service. Would return and recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place whenever I'm in town. The hostesses were rude when we walked in and we're more interested in their conversation than greeting us. The waitress was nice. Chicken and red velvet waffles were delicious, but not as good as I remember. I feel like the chicken portion has gotten smaller since my last visit. The cheese grits were great."}
{"text":"Very family friendly! That counts for a lot in this house. Breakfast is the only meal that we actually attempt to eat out with 3 preschoolers. Last week, the wait on a Sunday morning was almost 45 minutes but once we were seated our server was incredibly prompt and attentive. I was most impressed when my 2 year old ordered a hot chocolate and they brought her a mildly tepid version - kudos for that! The kids menu is simple and priced right - $5. They added chocolate chips to the kids pancakes for$.50. The kids' meals all came with a huge dish of beautiful fruit. My husband ordered an omelet special and it was fantastic. I ordered the banana pecan French toast and it really was too sweet for my taste.  Today we had no wait but the service was slightly less fantastic. My husband was served coffee with no cream or sugar and our salt shaker was empty. Our food was excellent but I was ready to bus my own table at the end because my kids were so antsy and the check was nowhere in sight. My husband finally had to give in and just take the kids out while I waited for the check. Still our fave breakfast place - will probably be back soon!"}
{"text":"Terrace cafe has been one of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte, but this week, I had the pleasure of sampling some of Terrace's new dinner menu, and thank God....grits are included!! I've always loved the grits here; they aren't to soupy, not too grainy and they are now a part of a shrimp and grits dinner menu item. I also had an interesting salad that included two colors of beets and a very delicious dressing. To top it all off , I enjoyed a gluten free peanut butter cheesecake that was so good I lost track of time eating it, zoned out a little."}
{"text":"Umm so yea! This is definitely the spot for breakfast if you're in Charlotte. I was between the chicken and waffles, French toast & egg white omelette. I decided to go with the poppy seed lemon French toast w/ a side of fried chicken. Most definitely worth it, plus a cappuccino!  The terrace had a cozy vibe & customer service was awesome. Can't wait to go back, we need places like this in Raleigh!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is a favorite breakfast spot! Red velvet waffle is too yummy!!! The pricing is fair and the service is good. On the down side, there us usually a long wait - especially on weekend mornings and the coffee bar isnt that great."}
{"text":"The food was okay, not great. I ordered the terrace biscuit, and I love biscuits but in my opinion this was too much biscuit, I wish they would've used a more equal portion of biscuit and egg. My husband got the stuffed monte cristo, he also said it was only okay. Our little girl got the spice donut dunker, and she didn't eat it. It had way too much spice in my opinion. The coffee was good, and the waiters were excellent. We sat at the bar and everyone was super nice, me and my little one were drooling over the fruit, one of them handed us each one. I also liked how attentive the staff was there. However, my husband dropped me off at the front so I could reserve a seat, I was told you cannot reserve until your whole party is there, which I can understand. I stepped to the side and waited for my husband and daughter. Two minutes later, another woman walked in, and I don't know if it's because she was white but they were ready to seat her even though she had clearly said a party of 4 (she was alone). The hostess saw me glare at her and set the menus back down, then proceeded to tell her the same thing. Because of this reason we chose to sit at the bar, and because of this reason I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Terrace Cafe and the secret seems to be getting out. I went a little early and put our names in, so we were seated almost as soon as the rest of the party arrived, but I heard wait times of up to 45 minutes quoted and people were actually staying! What does that tell you about how yummy their food is? That people are willing to wait & have a morning beer at Taco Mac just to eat there? Worth waiting for!  Anyway, I went for brunch with 3 other ladies and we all found something that sounded (and tasted!) excellent. However, I think I've written before about how good their food is, so I will take this opportunity to highlight their coffee. I never thought of them as a place to go specifically for coffee, but wow, they have upped their game on that front. My latte was perfection and one of my friends called her cappuccino \"the best she'd ever had.\" Yum, will return. :D"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped in for a quick breakfast.  Had the Southern Sausage Benedict.  Basically an Eggs Benedict with sausage in place of ham and a biscuit in place of the muffin.  The biscuit was a little dry, but the meal was tasty."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is a neat spot tucked into the base of a mixes use residential/office building offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. The decor is inviting with bar, ground, and upstairs seating options. By all accounts the waitstaff was very helpful and the entire environment was very warm.   We stopped into the Terrace Cafe for breakfast. The menu is varied and it offers a nice selection. We had a couple of omelette's and the shrimp and grits. The omelette's were stuffed to perfection and prepared perfectly. The portions were generous and the house made jam was amazing. Being from Pennsylvania, I have no clue what good grits are or how to prepare grits but these were fantastic. The dish was spicy, and the texture and consistency seemed spot on. The coffee was good and they were quick to refill.   The only slight downfall is price. You are getting quality food so the price for breakfast  is going to be a little more than traditional breakfast spots. If you are like me, and do not mind, check it out. Overall, the Terrace Cafe was a really fantastic breakfast spot and I would love to check it out for other meals."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience when I go to Terrace. It's one of my all time favor brunch spots! I love their red velvet waffle and chicken!! I get it just about every time I go for brunch. I've also had a breakfast drink...kinda a spin on the mimosa....there but I can't remember the name of it. It has grenadine and pineapple juice though and it's delicious! I've had their fried green tomatoes and they were very tasty as well. Honestly, I've never had anything that I didn't like at Terrace."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very welcoming and it was jammed packed on a Sunday for brunch but the wait wasn't long and the food was delicious! I ordered the red velvet waffle and fried chicken and it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First time at the Terrace Cafe and I can say that it definitely live up to the hype.    I am rather discerning about my desserts and red velvet is my favorite however I rarely find a really good red velvet anything. With that said, the red velvet waffles were amazing.  Light and fluffy; kinda opposite of how a red velvet cake or cupcake is but it works.  It is flavorful and the cream cheese icing is as light and perfect.  I am extremely impressed.    The shrimp and grits was delicious and savory.  I only had a bite but will definitely order it on another occasion.    I may not be a connoisseur of fried green tomatoes since I am not a Southerner and thought these were alright. I probably wouldn't order them again.  If you are in the Queen City, definitely make the time to come to the Terrace Cafe! A must stop on your culinary path."}
{"text":"Terrance Cafe is such an awesome place. The staff is very welcoming and the restaurant is inviting. I thought it was so nice that they had upstairs seating which overlooked the whole restaurant. Although this place is known for their brunch I ordered from the lunch menu. I order some type of fried chicken and veggies. My brother ordered the same thing but subbed the veggies out for a salad. When my brother got his check the price of subbing the salad was the full price of the salad. When asking the Server about it she took off $2. The portions aren't very big so if you have a big Appetite like myself this may not be the place for you. Over all the food was good along with the service."}
{"text":"Very cute place in the cut. Drive past it all the time and never went. My sister brought me and said the food was amazing. Everything was good from the food to the service. My sister ordered hot tea and it was so good(peach). Across from the mall under some apartments(or maybe condos). Chris was so nice and very attentive. I had the chicken and plain waffle. Loved it. I ate it all. Didn't like my hash browns though. Tasteless. Everything else was delicious. It was 29 for both of our meals. Not bad. Def worth it. Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked great. Def will go back. Parked across the street at ENT office(so not sure about the parking). Came after an appointment. No wait. Sat ourselves at the bar. Was after lunch time so it wasn't too busy."}
{"text":"I was very excited to dine at Terrace Cafe, from family members raving to Yelp hyping it seemed like it was going to be awesome. Perhaps my expectations were to high? No, perhaps I should have went for breakfast? Probably. I ordered an appetizer of fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese. They came out very hot and crispy with tons of flavor, easily the best part of my experience. My main course was the trout, veggie rice pilaf and tempura green beans. The food was by no means bad but it also wasn't anything memorable. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing because my friend loved his steak. I left feeling very underwhelmed, sucks when the appetizer is more exciting than main course. Whenever I return it will be for breakfast.  PS - you would think that a classy restaurant could offer a better beer selection than boring bud, coors and miller. Sure they had Sierra Nevada and Fat Tire but that was it. Beer is just as, if not more complex than wine, recognize."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is a solid lunch place! I've been there a couple of times and the food has never, ever been bad.   The restaurant is very well lit and has two stories so there is plenty of space. I'm not usually a salad person, but I haven't had anything else from there... their oyster salad (both Caesar and Spinach) are very good! I look over the menu and want to pick something different, but every time I end up getting the salad.   The service is good so overall I'm pretty happy going there for lunch. I've heard their brunch is even better though! I'll have to try it soon."}
{"text":"The service was very slow...but the WORST thing was this new policy they have about charging your credit card with a service charge. I was celebrating my sons graduation from college with my entire family and they gave me an additional service charge for using my credit card. The Terrace Cafe claims that many resturants are now doing it...I have never seen any resturant charge for using a credit card to pay....and there was no sign posted anywhere. Warning, before you go to the Tarrace Cafe, be aware they will charge you extra for using your credit card. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing ! Came out to Charlotte for a girls getaway and found this restaurant on Yelp! My friend and I decided to trip it out and was not disappointed. The first day I had the red velvet chicken and waffle with a side of hash browns. The one thing the set the waffle apart was the cream cream drizzle !! It was delicious. The chicken was cooked to perfection as well. My friend had the shrimp and grits ( which by the way was pretty good as well . I tasted some of hers. Nice flavor ) we decided to go the the restaurant the next day since it was close to our hotel and I had the chicken and biscuit with ghost pepper pimento cheese and jalapeño jam. Instead on placing the cheese and jam on the biscuit I asked for it on the side so I can place it on myself. However, the ghost pepper pimento cheese and that jalapeño jam on that chicken and biscuit was the right call!! It was one of the best chicken and biscuits I had .. ( chicken was cooked just right and the biscuit was good ) but it was the added extra that made it what it was !!! The server was very attentive and friendly even for a weekend. The place was extremely busy . If I ever visit Charlotte again I am going to make sure I come by this place!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Velvet Waffle.  It was Oh boy super delicious.  It was cruchy outside and soft inside so perfect.  I can eat about 20 of their waffles in one meal no problem.  The price is reasonable average about 10 dollars per dishes.  The seating is so cute, upstair and downstair.  On the upstair, they set up as a terrace so u could see thru the down stairs."}
{"text":"First time at Terrace.  We met some friends for Brunch and it was great.  Had the Chicken and Waffles with Fruit with a side of Hashbrowns.  Everything was great with the exception of the fruit.  Just disappointed in the quality.  Otherwise everything was perfect.  Will return."}
{"text":"If you leave here after breakfast and are able to eat lunch, you are not human. Food is wonderful here and very filling from all sorts of breakfast options."}
{"text":"Whenever I say Terrace Cafe, someone always goes \"ooo I heard that place was good\" or \"omg that place is so good!\" I have recommended the place to many ppl. Just be warned, there is always a wait, especially for Sunday brunch.   The food I have had and not one has let me down:  Chicken and waffles Red velvet waffles Steak and eggs Shrimp and grits  Chicken burger French toast Chicken wings  Service is always exceptional as well."}
{"text":"So, I was down in Charlotte for a couple days for a wedding.  The hotel I was staying at had an overpriced, lackluster breakfast buffet, so I decided to venture out to find food elsewhere.  After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I headed to The Terrace Cafe.  Normally when I'm in a strange town, I never eat at the same place twice as I want to try as much of the local scene as possible.  But after going to the Terrace Cafe on the first day, I decided to break this rule and head back on the second day.  On the first day, my wife and I were quickly seated.  She ordered the SEC breakfast sandwich, and I ordered the Belgian malted waffles.  Seth, the waiter, said to me \"Do you like bacon?\"  Which I replied \"I'm a guy.  Of course I like bacon.\"  He then told me that I should try the bacon waffle.  I decided to give a shot.  Now, Seth made it sound like the Bacon Waffle was better than sex.  Poor guy looked so disappointed when I told him it was \"pretty good\" (That really is a very high compliment from me.)  So, Bacon Waffle not better than sex, but definitely amongst the top breakfast's out there.  Wife enjoyed her SEC as well.    The next day, more relatives arrived for the wedding and we decided to head back to Terrace Cafe, but this time with a group of 8.    Again, we were sat very quickly, and Seth even remembered the wife and I from the day before.  I went with the more traditional Eggs Benedict, and Wife had an omelet.  The eggs benedict were the best I've had in quite some time (It's amazing how the hollandaise sauce can vary so much from restaurant to restaurant.)  Wife thoroughly enjoyed her omelet.  Now, as if the main breakfast entrees aren't enough to get you to come to Terrace Cafe, Then consider their sides.  I had their hash browns both days.  Pure fried shredded potato goodness.  Wife had the fruit cup, which she said is the best fruit she's ever had at a restaurant as it included some more exotic fruits.    I wish we had one more day in Charlotte as I really wanted to try the red velvet waffle.  Someone at the table next to us on the first day had it as a breakfast desert (seriously, they both had eggs benedict, which is quite filling, then split a red velvet waffle afterwards.)  I recommend this place for anyone in the Charlotte area.  It's traditional southern breakfast with a modern twist."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and got an omelette and a quiche. The food was pretty good. I would definitely recommend making reservations since it was very crowded."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning with my girlfriend for breakfast for the first time. The service was great.. since it was a Saturday morning I was expecting a long wait but that didn't occur...we were seated immediately and within 5 minutes we were greeted by our waiter...our food came pronto once we order and everything was really tasteful.. I enjoyed my blueberry vegan waffle.. vegan chorizo sausage paired with a pineapple mimosa..prices were in reason and great proportions. I will for sure come back here for another meal"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, and a great place and you get a lot of food, just wish they chicken wings. Lol"}
{"text":"I found my new brunch spot and it feels so good! My original brunch place all the way in the Plaza but totally worth the drive has gotten a bit too repetitive so while enjoying dinner one night at Piedmont, stumbled on this place. Super cute inside, friendly staff and aaahhhh yes, the sunday wait line. No problem, get yourself a latte and sip away until your called to the table. The food is so good, you wish you knew about it sooner. The eggs benedict floentine is my favorite. The french toast with creme bruele butter is so good you want to ask for more butter to go. The too have the apple butter sauce my original location carried (I thought it was signature mark, guess not, its bought by a bigger vendor). I can't wait to go back on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait! Red velvet waffle or the lemon poppy seed French toast is a must! Sometimes the wait can be long but if you are willing to wait it out, go outside your comfort zone and try one of their signatures."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while now, and I finally decided to check it out with my wife. After seeing all of the glowing reviews, I thought it would be a sure hit. It wasn't.  There's tons of close, free parking in the attached garage, so that makes getting here very easy. You can expect quite a wait. Ours was 45 minutes to an hour. Since it was cold outside, most people waiting just lurked around the tables in the lower level, which would bother me if I were dining there. On the plus side, the outdoor waiting area had a nice propane heater, so we were able to wait, stay warm, and avoid lurking.  The decor is reminiscent of a late-90's hotel buffet eating area. Upstairs, where we were seated, features low-hanging pipes and unsightly, painted flexible ducting that is draped precariously over pipes. Not a great ambiance, methinks.  The food was good overall. I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict, and my wife ordered the Canadian Bacon Benedict. She got a side of hashbrowns, and I got the cheese grits (upcharge). The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the English muffins, although they looked pretty thin, were very tasty. The cheese grits were good, but they were a little cold and were served in a tiny dish. Bummer.  I have to think that this place used to be something much, much better. At this point, most of the glowing reviews from a few years ago should be considered very, very misleading. Given all of the great brunch choices in CLT, I don't think I'll be back for a second visit any time soon."}
{"text":"I looooooove the Terrace Cafe! The only downside is the ridiculous wait on Sundays (often 1/2 hour or more with almost non-existent seating for the amount of people who are waiting).  The food is so delicious and I HIGHLY recommend their coffee drinks - I always get a Black and White (which I think is a regular mocha and a white mocha combined).  A+ (but seriously, guys, figure out a way to make the wait less crazy -- maybe a bigger location?)"}
{"text":"Went to Terrace Cafe for lunch and had an excellent experience.  Portions were large and filling and service was excellent.  The Shrimp and Grits is definitely a great menu item.  The Steak salad is a more than generous portion.  I would recommend this to anyone...each time I go, I have a good experience.    Service was excellent as Matthew did a phenomenal job.  A manager even stopped by and was very pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Seriously the chicken and waffles are chicken tenders and waffles. The hash browns are so nasty they taste like the smell of the hotel glasses they keep in the room. Musty! Yuck never again. No wonder ppl from Charlotte think it's good because Charlotte has some of the worst food I've ever had. I'm a northern we have real food and real restaurants. I won't come back nasty! And my waitress never checked on me either. So terrible service so disappointed"}
{"text":"We came to Terrace for a Monday brunch and were left with a mostly average experience. I ordered the Stuffed Monte Cristo and my SO ordered the Chicken and Waffles.   The Monte Cristo was on the soggy side - so it made the sandwich hard to eat. The portion was huge, but the sogginess hurt the overall experience.  The Chicken & Waffles were great! They come highly recommended, especially if you pair it with their famous Red Velvet Waffle. However, the side of hash browns we both got were really disappointing. They were only crisped on one side, so the interior of the hash browns were soggy.  Get the chicken and waffles - but otherwise, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have yet to try their brunch but hear it's exceptional. Only complaint is the breakfast sandwich was a bit dry. Salads are awesome, great iced tea & service is exceptional. Very cool vibe."}
{"text":"Went to an early breakfast and had the red velvet waffles. As you can tell by all the pictures they are outstanding!! The omelette looked really good as well. I really don't think you can wrong with whatever you order here :)"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch on a Wednesday and while I had been in the Piedmont Town Center for Taco Mac, I had never been here!  She had suggested it, raving about their brunch on Sundays, so it sounded wonderful.  The atmosphere is quaint and lovely, charming in a \"brunch-ey\" kind of way.  We were seated quickly and the lunch crowd was already in full swing.  Our server was prompt and attentive and didn't rush us, which was nice because we were catching up, leisurely.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  My friend ordered the BLT with extra bacon and fries.  My sandwich was delicious, although I asked for the blue cheese sauce to be put on the side, as I am more of a ranch dressing kinda girl.  Glad I did....the blue cheese sauce (or fondue as they called it) was too overpowering for the delightful breading and tasty wing sauce on the chicken.  I dipped it in ranch and was quite happy!  The salad was yummy, although the dressing was too oily, so I would suggest sticking with the ranch, as it was delicious!  I sampled my friends' fries and they were quite nice, too!  Overall, I would like to come back for the brunch here, as the red velvet waffles sound to-die-for!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visit. I took the kiddies and they enjoyed the chicken and waffles, pancakes and fruit, while I had the shrimp and grits. The space is little small, the staff is friendly it seems depending on who's your server that day. Overall the food is always good."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles,  Crispy bacon  Yummy grits  More menu items to try later  They did struggle mightily with my basted egg request."}
{"text":"If you can't tell from the large amount of reviews or the weekend crowds, this place is fantastic. On the weekends during regular morning/brunch time, be prepared to wait for awhile. They don't really take reservations or call-in advance during those times. But trust me it's well worth the wait. Whenever a friends visit from out of town, I make sure to bring them here. The food is delicious!  My personal favorite the lemon poppyseed French toast. Friends have raved about the chicken & red velvet waffle and the crab cake Benedict.  Just writing this, I'm craving some terrace cafe!"}
{"text":"This place always has a wait on a sunday.. at least an hour but it is well worth the wait.. there brunch is amazing. I always get the red velvet waffle which is soooooo delicious. They also have the shredded has browns which is my all time favorite hash browns. The shredded ones are the best kind. We just went and they had a special for pumpkin waffles but by the time we got in they had already run out which was a bummer. My fiancee got the grits and he said they were also amazing"}
{"text":"At terrace cafe its become so popular that there's a wait! What a great problem to have. I would say the quality of the food is still top notch, the hospitality is really good and the service is good. If I had to say anything negative its the fact that this particular visit we didn't receive place settings until our food came! Thats all! This is a great spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Charlotte hands down! Super packed on Sundays! I love their breakfast choices!"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the Shrimp & Grits (gluten free) and it was a life altering experience. I walked into Terrace as a broken man. The Shrimp & Grits put me back together   Service: very friendly despite how busy they were   Will I come back? YES"}
{"text":"Consistently good food here. I've only had the Belgian waffle, chicken Apple sausage, grits or hash brown and everything is good. The mimosas are pretty good as well. Waits can be looong on the weekends, so be prepared for that.  There is a small bar upfront and you can order coffee or espresso while you wait."}
{"text":"I went her for lunch with a friend not really knowing what to expect the restaurant is clean and service is good the food is forgettable to me though I might have just ordered the wrong thing"}
{"text":"The Bananna Nut french toast is to die for my bacon was a little cold and the eggs were fried too hard but other then that the service was good"}
{"text":"Food is decent but expensive for what you get.  Consistently very busy.   If you work in Piedmont Town Center and you have to eat real food quickly before your next meeting, Terrace is a great option. If you're not in a huge rush, there are better options (both in quality and in price) within a few minutes drive."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this place about a week ago for Father's Day, and we were expecting it to be really good from the pictures/reviews I saw, but it turns out it was overhyped.  To begin, I would lie to start with the service. Since it was Father's Day, we were expecting it to not be the greatest service, which is totally fine. However, our first server seemed to have no interest in us whatsoever, and he made some poor, overworked server take his place instead. Our service from this next server was decent, probably because she had so many tables to staff. Also, when our food arrived, we had no utensils on our table, and we waited a good five minutes before any utensils were brought to us (by the way, my Dad had to get up and find someone instead of just waiting even longer for our server to show up).   Now for our mediocre food. Everything but the lemon poppyseed French toast was just \"meh\" food. I ordered the Bavarian creme French toast sticks, which sounded good, and they actually okay apart from the very oily taste from them being deep fried and there not being creme in the whole French toast stick. The other dishes we ordered that were just okay as well were the full breakfast and eggs Benedict. Not only was the full breakfast overpriced for what it was, but it did not come as ordered either. Not to mention, my dad got food poisoning from it as well (on Father's Day!:( )  Overall, the only good thing about this place was the lemon poppyseed French toast."}
{"text":"You simply can't beat this place for breakfast. They have great eggs Benedict. Service is always been fast and good. Parking looks like it's going to be trouble but it's not. All you have to do is park in the parking deck. I've never had an issue."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is delicious. The drinks are amazing. The orange juice makes me never want to drink any other orange juice. And they have this blueberry jam or maybe blueberry peach. It is uhhh-mazing."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be thoroughly impressed and I have heard so many great things about their Red Velvet Waffle. I went this past Sunday for brunch with a friend. And it was just okay. First of all the red velvet waffle just tasted like a regular waffle, it needs more cocoa in their batter to give more of a taste. At least their cream cheese syrup wasn't too sweet. Their hash browns could have used some seasoning. And the fried chicken, is really a chicken breast cut in half and battered and fried. I have had better brunch at the Cheesecake factory, Bistro La Bon, 131 Main, and Pike's Place. It just boggles my mind that there are so many good reviews when their food is just average. Also we ordered a hot chocolate and vanilla latte. The hot chocolate was just water with some cheap cocoa powder, I could have made a better hot chocolate with my godiva cocoa powder mix and the vanilla latte you could just taste a cheap vanilla abstract. I am not trying to be negative I am just keeping it very honest so others will not get disappointed like me. However, the wait staff was great."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant so much! It is consistently delicious every time and the staff are so friendly! It's a lovely environment and it is always a pleasure to visit. Lastly, do NOT forget to give the red velvet waffle a try! It is amazing!"}
{"text":"So many of my friends have told me of this place.  I went today for the first time!!! Wow! All the Food looked so amazing and it taste Great!!  We were seated quickly and they were very welcoming, however the Food I loved the flavor and it taste delicious tried to eat it but it was cold :( even after we sent it back still came back cold  I was sad because I ordered the Caramel Apple French Toast \"it was cold and my cheese eggs where ok except they were cold so the cheese didn't really melt. Didnt get the full French Toast  you get 2 for $11 to add eggs is $4 to add cheese is  $1  .. it was all cold.. kitchen at the door,,,, plates at the window ppl sitting waiting to eat waitresses talking and not helping each other push food out to customers is why my food was cold! They are a great business and Food is A++++++ but it was cold because they were not helping to push the Food out to customers\"  Experience"}
{"text":"Red Velvet Waffles. S'mores French Toast. I love how when it comes to breakfast, you can add tons of junkfood to any staple and suddenly it's a perfectly acceptable meal. It's like calling something a muffin instead of a cupcake...no guilt when you eat your non-cupcake at 7:30a.m.   Thanks to the fabulous Yelp reviews we used the occasion of out-of-town friends passing thru CLT as an excuse to head south and meet the fine people at Terrace. Here are the reasons for my four stars and new devotion:  1: Call ahead seating and very sweet and efficient hostesses. Makes life MUCH easier when the wait is 45min, it's sahara hot and you're schlepping two toddlers.  2: Samples of fresh, warm, house made donuts while you wait.   3: Contemporary yet comfortable atmosphere. You are equally at home in shorts/tee or a cute summer dress.  4: The service was outstanding.   5: The food was, quite simply, delicious. I do think the Red Velvet Waffle was a bit overpriced for what it is, but the S'mores french toast are so rich and gooood. The omeletts are big and full of whatever your heart desires. Shrimp and grits had a nice flavor and texture BUT isn't much food if you have a big eater in your party.  They bring snacks for the kids, deliver their food ASAP and are very engaging w/them. The servers are all helpful and concerned about your experience. Overall, a great dining experience and our friends are looking fwd to heading this way again soon for another go 'round. :)"}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is one of my favorite brunch spots in all of Charlotte! I have now been there multiple times all for brunch and I have never left with less than a belly full of delicious food!   My first time I tried Terrace Cafe a friend and I each got a beautiful latte. We shared the florentine eggs benedict and the special lemon poppyseed french toast. As a true lover of all types of eggs benedict, the florentine was very good. The lemon poppyseed french toast was really unique and tasty. It tasted almost like lemon poppy seed bread made into french toast. Very dense and filling, but perfect with the lemon sauce.   On my next visit I decided that it was time to accept that I have moved to the South and try the chicken and waffles... Let me just say I totally know why this is such a hit! It was absolutely AWESOME. A great combination of sweet and savory, I had to finish every last bite, because it was too good to leave on the plate. It came with a side of grits, which were buttery. To drink I got the french press coffee and a mimosa, but great additions to a wonderful meal. My friend got fried green tomatoes and the BEC Biscuit both of which were very tasty too.   The atmosphere at Terrace is very inviting, for such a popular restaurant they are able to keep the wait minimized for the most part and it is very worth it. I have had nothing but friendly staff and service. Not too needy, but plenty attentive. If you want breakfast/brunch this is your place. I promise you will not be disappointed. Maybe I will try lunch or dinner sometime, if it is anything like their breakfast I know I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The YMCA omelet is very good. Loved the hasbrowns (they're the shoestring kind), and the apple butter was delicious."}
{"text":"This brunch was AMAZINNGGGG!!! I got a cajun shrimp omelet which was so delicious. The best part of all to my surprise was the strawberry jam!! I just wanted to take a gallon of that home with me."}
{"text":"I'm referring only to the Ballantyne location. Nice people working there. . .that's the best I can say. Food is CONSISTENTLY INCONSISTENT. It comes out of the kitchen in various forms,  and not resembling the menu description. We should have returned several meals. . .we hate to spoil a night out, but we've given them several chances and like Forrest Gumps mom said \"Life is like a box of chocolates.  .ya' never know what you are gonna get'.That sho' is the case here. Finito!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. However, maybe the worst hostesses I have ever seen!   Terrace employs 3 hostesses on weekends however, at one time my husband and I counted 10 open tables . We looked down and saw the hostesses just checking their phones, literally  no cares in the world- as more guests come in- one explains that there is a 25 min wait (huh?).  One 4 seater remained empty for the enitre hour my husband and I were eatting, yet there  are like 15 people outside (including toddlers) in heat desperately waiting to sat in nice cool AC. I was a hosteess for many years and don't feel that it was explained to these girls that  servers can't make money unless you seat their tables. These girls are costing this resturant and it's servers money, in this economy not a joke."}
{"text":"Amazing! First time here for lunch today with a friend. I knew I wanted the salad with salmon on it from looking at there website but what I got was better than I imagined. I don't know if I'll be able to try anything else because of how delicious it was."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is excellent!!  The waffles, chicken apple sausage & steak & eggs were delicious!!!!  The service was prompt but very attentive!!!! Luv this breakfast spot!!!!  I would have given it 5 stars but the wait coupled with the parking were 2 huge challenges :("}
{"text":"I LOVE their Red Velvet Waffle. Even though you automatically think of cake, it's not too heavy or sweet. I actually prefer this waffle over a slice of red velvet cake, which I don't really like. The hash-browns were pretty good, very circular, lol! I've tried the turkey sandwich, and it was fine, but I wouldn't get it again. My servers have always been very nice and helpful. Whenever I go, I like to sit upstairs because I like the quaint, intimate feel. I've never experienced an outrageous wait or an unsatisfactory experience. Their prices aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch but I must say, the food is amazing! I go here every time I go to Charlotte and each time it has been very good. The Omelettes are my favorite along with their hashbrowns.  The service could be a bit better but it is understandable since they are always so busy."}
{"text":"Very cute brunch spot in South Park! We went on a Sunday morning at 11:00am and had about a 40 minute wait. It was the first weekend that they were serving alcohol for brunch and we were able to get a mimosa from the bar while we waited. There's also seating outside while you wait. I got pancakes and eggs and sausage and it was good. I tasted my friends red velvet waffle and it was deelish! My other girlfriend got French toast and loved it!! Very reasonable prices...mimosa was $7 meal was no more than $13! Great value and great brunch ambiance!! Our waiter was super attentive and always checked on us. I definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went for the first time today for lunch. Very good menu and decor....this place can be noisy ( open ceiling echos) . Loved the shrimp and grits...unique and spicy. Wife got the popular \"full breakfast' also favorable, yes, everything is a little pricey but it is southpark and I'm sure the rent is high as hell. The waiter had to be one of the BEST in Charlotte. I believe his name was Matt. He made the place better and I will definitely return"}
{"text":"This place was really nice and had a fun vibe,but the service was horrible. Im sure everyone was hungover but wow it was horrible. I would def come here for food though. I had the soup and Cesar salad and was very happy. They also had red velvet waffles which was mind blowing.  I would def come here again"}
{"text":"Awesome food and one of best customer service experiences.  Ate the chicken and red waffles velvet with a Russian memo it was quite delicious indeed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte. Red velvet waffles, pancakes, sides, including hash browns were all scratch made. So were the biscuits and the breakfast casserole I ate. All good! My hubby is a coffee snob and he loved the French press. Expect a wait but so worth it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and our server was really knowledgeable and friendly. I got the Filet Bendict and my bf got the shrimp and grits, both we're amazing! The homemade coffee cake is too delicious for words! The best part is this place is not expensive."}
{"text":"I got my meal and the omelette seemed a little oily. They tried to hide the fact that they had burned my toast by putting on a plate burned side down. There was a fruit something in a small dish on my plate. Not sure what it was - too watery for jelly or jam. The atmosphere seems a little off - the space is small so it could be intimate but its way too vaulted for you to feel it. While dining I had the joy of seeing what I assumed was the trash bin being taken out through the dining area. All in all, not great."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic brunch spot! That is evidenced by the fact that the place was packed! When my friend and I arrived, we were told the wait was 25 minutes but thankfully a table in the bar area opened up and we sat down quicker than the quoted 25 minutes. Chris was our server and he was very friendly, knowledgable about the menu and gave us his honest opinions about the dishes we had questions about. The food was so delicious and there was so much on the menu that looked good. I had the breakfast casserole, which was absolutely delicious but I can't wait to go back to try the shrimp and grits because they looked amazing! The bartender that morning (I wish I had gotten his name!) was amazing as well. Great service, great food, get there early!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I got a chance to check this place out during restaurant week.  This place is really tasty and I can't wait to check out brunch sometime!  Here's a breakdown of what we got to try:  Fried Green Tomatoes (4/5): Great level of crispiness in the batter, which was a little plain-tasting.  However, the pimento cheese served with them adds a great touch and makes them much more flavorful.  Biscuits (4/5): I love that they are served with some sort of pepper jelly.  They are so tiny, maybe 2 inches in diameter.  They were not dry and surprisingly flaky.  Blue crab bisque (4.5/5): Very rich and flavorful.  Full of great crab flavor.  The sherry really complemented the flavors.  Wedge salad (3.5/5): The bleu cheese is relatively smooth in this, so I appreciated it.  I loved the crispy red onion - they were the BOMB!  However, it's a little too much wedge and not enough of the delicious toppings.  Terrace fried chicken (4.5/5): The fried chicken was excellent!  The batter was great, it was a good size, and the gravy was fantastic.  The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, just how I like them.  The collard greens were good as well, and they reminded me of these fantastic ones that made me fall in love with cooked greens.  Chicken and Waffle (5/5):  Ok, this was seriously amazeballs!  The watermelon salad paired so well and was so refreshing with everything.  I could have eaten a whole plate of this alone.  The waffled and chicken were good on their own, but then came the red hot syrup.  Holy guacamole!  It had the perfect level of spicy sweetness that just brought the whole meal together.  This is my favorite chicken and waffles dish I've ever had.  We also ordered drinks, and mine came out a great electric green, which ruled.  Since we came on a weeknight, it wasn't too busy, which was fantastic.  I am glad I made a reservation just in case, though.  The service was good, but some weirdness came when the bill got there.  I had a gift card for $60 and with the drinks it should have come up to around $75.  However, the bill was around $85.  I called the waitress over to ask about it, and she never really gave me a very good explanation about what the extra charges were.  It was not added gratuity because I asked.  I did not see a manager or anyone else around, and by that time we were headed to a movie we did not want to miss.  It never did get resolved and I'm pretty sure we got overcharged.  I would just caution people using a gift card to watch out what the final bill ends up being.  This was very annoying.  Still, the food was good and I think I would probably come back."}
{"text":"Best pumpkin latte I have ever had in my life. Awesome southern style biscuits and gravy, perfect soft scrambled eggs and creative french toast options. So glad we tried them out on our short visit to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Top brunch spot in Charlotte!! Get here early on Sundays, the wait is long. However it is worth the wait. Mimosas are strong, customer service is great, atmosphere is family friendly and spacious. I recently went on Sunday and ordered the crab cake Benedict - amazing! This is my first time having a crab Benedict and I'm hooked. Portions are large which is worth the cost."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, but always a wait on the weekends, but I guess that's because it's so good.  They have made some menu changes that's I'm not 100% happy about, but still one of my favorite brunch places"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot!! Red Velvet Waffles so moist and tasty!! Omelet was good as well!! Lots to pick from!!"}
{"text":"I love brunch nom nom nom! I'm ALWAYS on the hunt for a good brunch spot so I'm glad we decided on this place. I have passed the area that it's in a few times but never really thought to venture in . It's tucked away right near the parking garage, which is kinda convenient and a short walk. We went on a Sunday around 12pm maybe and we waited around 30 mins for a table of 3. I tried a Mimosa which was good, more champagne than I expected so that was a plus along with the chocolate chip malted Belgian waffle with a side of grits and hash browns. The waffle came with one side but I'm southern so it's only right that I have grits with my meal  Overall my food was good presentation wide could have been a bit better for the waffle - looks like they literally threw some chocolate chips on there and sent it out the door. I definitely would go back to try an omelet or the French toast! The only annoying part is that they don't' have much waiting room inside so either you stand out in the cold or cram inside."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for breakfast and brunch. Convenient parking. Quality coffee! Nice staff"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was horrendous. Our server's name was Seth. The service started off lackluster, but, got progressively worse. He didn't check on our party of five once, nor did he offer to refill our beverages when he did half ass check in. Seth was extremely rude, unprofessional and disgusting. It was my birthday and I drove an hour and thirty seven minutes to dine there. After experiencing the level of service we did, you couldn't pay me to return. If you MUST patronize this establishment, get a carry out. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The chicken and red velvet waffle are awesome! Lunch menu items were only so-so. Service was good and had a nice atmosphere. I would give it 5 stars if some of the prices were a little less-drink prices were not with what you get"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here  the down side was the fact that they don't take reservations for breakfast and brunch but given the crowd I understand . It gets pack fast ! You will wait ! don't come starving because it will be a minute before your seated and not without your entire party present just fyi . The service good , and my food was yummy I ordered the Banana pecan French toast with fruit and a side of ham. The ham was way too salty . I couldn't finish eat and need water right after the first bite super salty, but he French toast was good made with banana bread and topped with huge pecans and banana slices. I will come back and try the famous red velvet waffles next time."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch -- First of all, I've tried many a bloody mary in various restaurants and bars in charlotte and I must say, theirs is by far the best I've had!  So, I'll be back just for another one of those!!!  About the food, we ordered the veggie egg white omelet served with fruit.  The omelet was pretty good but I have had better.  However, I always order a side of salsa to go with the omelet and their salsa was yummy.  So, I'd recommend adding the salsa to give the omelet a bit more flavor!  The fried green tomatoes are average.  My friend ordered the steak and eggs and declared that steak was delicious.  Coffee drinks were a big hit at our table as well.  The service was ok...they made a couple mistakes but nothing that wasn't fixed quickly.  I'll definitely be back.  There's more I want to try on their menu!"}
{"text":"This was a cute place! Looks like it's suppose to be a fancy place. The silverware and cups were all curvy shaped which fascinated me. The red velvet waffle came with a white sauce that had a good touch to it. The chicken is boneless and easy to cut and eat with the waffles. The hash browns were alright but at least everything else was good! I'd definitely come back for some more dishes with the chicken!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had here was amazing. Every time I am in Charlotte it is a must! The wait can be a little long.... hours long in the weekend.... But it is worth it! Come with a group and you won't see time pass, by the time you are sitting down and ordering all is right with the world."}
{"text":"From the look of the place I thought the food would be better. Why a 2 instead of 1? Because at least my friends had better food, and the hostess was a nice girl.   1) I don't know why the waitress did not like me, but she was curt to me. She was not with anybody else at the table. My friends did not appreciate that either. When I ordered my food, she did not let me finish what I was saying. My boyfriend had to basically tell her I was not done ordering.   2) What I ordered was not as advertised. Don't call something Nashville hot chicken, or chicken with Nashville hot sauce when all you did was use buffalo sauce. I have actually had great Nashville hot chicken and this was not even close. There was not a hint of Nashville sauce on it. My fries were also cold.   3) I ordered the dueling mimosa. I saw the pictures of it and mine did not even resemble that. What I got was a plain mimosa. I was very irritated about that, and my fries being cold.   I will not be back here. If the waitress was not rude to me, maybe I would consider it but that was not a good experience for me. If you have mediocre food, your service better be perfect and this was far, far below that."}
{"text":"Poor management of assistant manager. Waited for 2 hours to be seated. Food came in less than 20 minutes but the food was not hot and just warm. I ordered chicken and waffles and the waffles were pretty good, everything else was just OK. I WOULD NOT COME BACK!!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, everyone was incredibly helpful and SO NICE!! We had Nate as our server who was just the nicest dude I've had as a server!  But the greatest part was of course the FOOD! Florentine eggs benedict = AMAZING!!! Was just a wonderful place all around. AND! They carry stevia in their sugar caddies! Definitely one of my favorite little touches."}
{"text":"Great souther brunch and lunch in charlotte. Things to try- 1. Shrimp and grits. 2. Coffee cake- really amazing! 3. Kentucky fried chicken. 4. Red velvet waffle  The service is good. Weekends are packed with people so be weary of that."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, reasonable wait, AMAZING food. Get the red velvet waffle and eggs Benedict. The waffle is soft and sweet but not overly so, and just thinking about the melted cream cheese atop makes me salivate. The eggs Benedict florentine was also incredible, with an excellent balance of salty mustard with crispy fried onions and tomato and perfectly poached eggs that broke beautifully before oozing into the warm English muffin.  Pro-tip: if you just order the waffle without the sides, it's $8. Perfect for sharing ;)  Terrace Cafe doesn't take brunch reservations, but our party of 4 arrived on a Saturday at 11am. We waited for only 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE RED VELVET WAFFLE! It's so dang good! And I always get the fried chicken with it!"}
{"text":"Special thanks to everyone at Terrace and Nikki for hosting a lovely event!   I've had brunch at the Ballantyne location. This was my first time visiting the South Park area. I was impressed with the menu this evening. Everyone was offered a glass of white or red wine. I selected the Chardonnay. I believe the other was a Merlot.   Each course was served on small plates.  The Appetizers - Wild Mushroom Crostini and Buttermilk Calamari. I loved these items! If I had to choose, I'd say the Crostini was my favorite. The three cheese spread is life changing.   The Beet salad was refreshing, however It didn't earn my memory.   Entrees - Bourbon Braised Beef Short Ribs, Shrimp and Grits, and finally The Gnocchi & Wild Mushrooms. I was a fan of everything! I noticed the shrimp and grits came with a sauce---Which I didn't receive, I was slightly disappointed. The side of Vegetable medley was a after thought. No seasoning. I wouldn't recommend ordering this.   Finally! Dessert!! I couldn't pass up the peanut butter fudge cheesecake! I should've ordered a slice to go!! I picked off the chocolate seemed a bit much. Plan to return in here again soon for brunch."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the Grits are the best I've ever eaten. All the staff are very courteous, and friendly. Once we ordered our Breakfast it arrived very quickly. Our Server Annette was excellent. Will return here next time I am in the area. Randy, Asst. Mgr. came to our table and asked if everything is okay. Good touch, that tells me they try to resolve any issues to keep the Patrons satisfied."}
{"text":"The red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle was delicious! I placed a to go order and was out in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it was terrific!   Although it has eccentric silverware and plates the food is amazing.  I had the shrimp and grits which was a very hearty and filling breakfast.  I fully recommended it to anyone passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is well worth the wait and drive: the red velvet waffles are amazing and the eggs Benedict tasted fresh and delicious. The drop coffee and fresh orange juice were great compliments to the sweet and salty meal.   Highly recommended for the atmosphere and the food. Service was a tad bid slow but  we went at prime time on a Saturday and that is expected. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful though. On par with my favorite places in Cali...enjoy."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast after a doctor's appointment.  I didn't realize the restaurant was as big as it is but they sat me at a 2-seater table that was crammed between two other larger tables and it was a bit uncomfortable.  They have a broad breakfast menu and I asked my server for a recommendation and she said everything was good.  Geez, that didn't help me much.  So I went with the \"Full Breakfast\" option which came with 2 eggs, meat of choice, side of choice and a small green salad.  Also came with a couple of pancakes.  My choice of meat was turkey bacon and the side was the hash browns.    The eggs were decent, the hash browns were made in a round patty.  The best thing was the crunchy outside and presentation.  The inside fell apart as soon as the crust was gone.  The turkey bacon was tough and the salad was a nice inclusion.  My pancakes were a bit rubbery and made me long for the ones at Toast.    Not a great first impression with the food.  But they get higher marks because my server was extra perky!  Presentation was wonderful.  And for your sweetener options, they have stevia.   Also on the menu are YMCA recommended options.  Might be worth another try if I'm in the area.  We'll see."}
{"text":"Mehh, I live right by piedmont row(walking distance) and I have walked by here on numerous occasions for walking my dog. I guess there has always been a good reason why I never tried this place. After coming here for lunch today with a friend, I am unimpressed.  We came during prime time weekday lunch hour at noon, but most of the cafe is empty...I'd say only 1/3 full. When we entered, we were greeted and seated promptly. I did like our waiter a lot, he seemed professional, good-command of the manner, efficient and courteous (epitome of a good waiter). My friend and I haven't seen each other for a while so we were busy chatting, he told us that whenever we were ready to order we just need to close our menu, that way he'll know we are ready so he would not have to keep coming by to disturb us. This is a very smart idea, more restaurants need to do this!! I ordered the 1/2 soup half sandwich of chichken salad on a croissant and italian chicken noodle soup. I was not very happy with neither the sandwich or the soup. First of all, they only have 2 soups for you to choose from, there is no soup menu, it is just whatever soup is designated for soup of the day. I've had way better chicken salad sandwich, the filling was pretty bland, I did not like the flavor. My soup was very greasy, it came out red, I've never had red chicken noodle soup.  My friend ordered the pimetto tomato sandwich with bacon with a side of fruit. Her sandwich also looked dry. The fruits that came as a side looked ok, but they are just fresh fruit, a combo of sweet melon, pineapple and large blackberry.  We ordered a lemon truffle to share for dessert. That was the BEST part of the meal. The dessert was very rich. I really like the layered presentation, the top is shredded pieces of lemon, then whip cream, then cheesecake, then lemon tart, then ground pecan. Awesome. I will be willing to come back here for dessert but definitely not for a full blown meal.  Also, they serve breakfast until 2:30PM."}
{"text":"The service here was wonderful! I got the most simple thing every and wish I had tried something more worth giving critique on, like their chicken. I will try it again before basing my overall opinion on the food. My family however loved their food. My husband got the steak and eggs and my daughter got scrambled eggs and bacon. I got a red velvet waffle that my son's devoured for me I ended up ordering another so I could try it. My son is picky so The fact that he ate it so fast had me curious and it was worth it ! Looooved that dang waffle! Again the service was perfect and our waitress Savanah was so cute and great!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here during restaurant week. And we enjoyed our meal.   I'm a sucker for prime rib so I ordered that. I'm not sure if it's still on their regular menu, but it was delicious. The sides were good too!  Our server was very friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. From what I remember, the dining room could use a little reno, but it wasn't too bad. It wouldn't deter me from coming back.   I've heard that brunch is awesome here. We've been meaning to give it a try.   But from what I did experience at Terrace Cafe on our first visit, I would definitely like to return."}
{"text":"Incredible red velvet waffles. We came here for brunch around 1030 and were seated within 20 minutes. We had a delicious pineapple and orange mimosa from the bar while we waited.   The waffles and cheese grits were the best I ever had."}
{"text":"All the food is great.  Order from the specials menu.  You wont be disappointed.  Service is lacking unless you sit at the bar.  Atmosphere is OK, but the food really is worth the trip, especially breakfast and lunch.  Great fruit side dish."}
{"text":"11/15/10  Terrace Cafe was a place I'd bookmarked weeks before my sister had mentioned hearing about its red velvet waffle from a coworker.  It sounded so delicious to her, she couldn't wait for us to try it!  Thank goodness her GPS system was cooperating that morning-- we found the parking garage easily.  Reaching the cafe proved a little bit tougher, even when I stopped to ask a security guard.  Or maybe we were just a little past the point of starving??  I really liked the entrance of the cafe, which had a nice-looking deli case full of specialty juices, pre-made salads, and dessert.  I really liked the energy here and was hoping we'd be able to sit at one of the two empty tables, but we were relegated to the back of the restaurant, where the energy was significantly muted (quite sleepy, actually), and the atmosphere there (from the large and dull wall paintings and dim lighting) made me think we were dining at a generic hotel chain restaurant after the buffet rush.  Service was very slow, as well, which I thought was odd, given that there was only one other occupied table besides ours.  After much deliberation as to what to order, we decided on the Red velvet waffle ($10), the California French toast ($10), a side of bacon ($3.50), and a side of two eggs, scrambled ($2.50).  We also ordered coffee for the table.  Mom and sister enjoyed their scrambled eggs, and we all liked the hash browns, extra-crispy on the outside by request, that I chose to accompany the waffle (options also included grits and fruit).  The bacon slices were thick-cut, wonderfully-crisped, and flavorful-- well-worth the $3.50 price tag.  Mom and I found the coffee to be very weak... Funny that sis and I were drawn to this place w/ the promise of earth-shattering delicious red velvet waffle, which she found to be boring, and I to be too fluffy and lacking of rich, chocolatey goodness, w/ its cream cheese drizzle proving to be too sweet to flip over this flop of a breakfast treat!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g#pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g  BUT there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was the California French toast!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg#_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg  This beauty of a dish consisted of three large slices of orange-scented French toast, which were drizzled w/ orange-infused honey and a side of wonderful cranberry butter!  I wished I'd ordered this, instead!  I wished I'd ordered anything other than that silly waffle!  But I digress... Really, the French toast is not to be missed.  I would, however, request for a crispier crust, should we ever return."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I just moved here from Austin Tx and I have been looking for a cool place to have brunch.  I was so impressed by the staff and how friendly everyone is.  Brooke was AWESOME!!!!  :)  She is so sweet and attentive! She made our dining experience so great!"}
{"text":"FRIED GREEN TOMATO HEAVEN.  I seriously love this place. I've gone three times now, and every time it just gets better. I don't know how, but they continually outdo themselves.   In terms of location & decor, I prefer SouthPark to Ballantyne, although both are nice and both are delicious.  I've only been for brunch, but it's the best brunch food I've ever had. A couple of stand-out meals:  Smores French Toast if you need an incredible sugar rush & incredible gourmet french toast.  Lemon Poppyseed Waffle--not too sweet. It's just perfect. Fresh fruit on the side perfectly compliments.  Biscuits and gravy--the best gravy I've ever had on a Southern biscuit. Period.  Fried green tomatoes--you can see from the first sentence how I feel about them. I'm in love.  Seriously. If you want a nice brunch, go to Terrace. Just remember that there's no alcohol before noon on Sundays :)"}
{"text":"Next time I go to Charlotte I will be having breakfast here!  I got the omelete and added turkey bacon, spinach, and cheese it was delicious.  Instead of toast I opted for the pancake and it was actually undercooked, but the delicious omelete made up for it.  Everyone else had the red velvet waffles which the place is known for and according to all my friends it was heavenly.  Not much of a red velvet fan but everything else was good and $5 mimosas are a win!!!  The most surprising thing at the restaurant is the speedy wait time.  When we arrived it was really busy, but the hostess said 30mins and in 30mins we were seated.  Unfortunately, our entire party was not there and they won't seat you unless everyone is there. However, since we were starving we sat without the missing people, but the staff was very accommodating to allow our remaining friends to seat at the table next to us once they arrived.  All in all, this is a great place with amazing food!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not have a chance to even place my to-go order. I tried to call and place my order, however the staff did not answer and the website would not let us order online. My co-worker and I decided to walk over and place our to-go order since we work in the same business park. Well it wasn't very busy plus it was after lunch rush hour. However, the host said we could place our orders at the bar. Well the lady at bar didn't acknowledge us and took another customer's order that came in after us. We decided to leave after that  bc we waited over 15mins. Now there was another waitress that appeared to casually standing and talking to the hostess and never offered to help us either. We ordered from Brio and returned to our office. Come to find out our  colleagues  had the same experience with customer service and decided to go to Brio as well. Terrace Cafe please work on your customer service. I've never had this experience at the Ballantyne cafe and experienced awesome customer service and food."}
{"text":"Great food! The menu is huge. We love this place. It's a great brunch spot. I had the biscuit and gravy last time And my boyfriend had one of the eggs Benedict. We haven't been for dinner yet though :( we will definitely be going back,"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this restaurant! I waited 30 minutes to sit down! Then we ordered! The food came 30 minutes later! It was old! Three of the six people food never came! We sent the food back and it still came out cold! The manager admitted we would not be happy because it was his kitchen"}
{"text":"Where to start with this place. First, the ambiance when you walk in is top notch. The layout is great with plenty of seating both downstairs and up. We sat upstairs and had a great view of the restaurant. The food is incredible. We ordered a variety of items all of which were comparable (if not a bit better!) than some of the eclectic breakfast joints in Asheville. Between the three of us we shared the red velvet waffle, banana bread French toast, bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and the egg and cheese biscuit. All were some of the best we've ever had. We will definitely be coming back to the terrace cafe. It is a must stop while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there on Saturday morning.   Yelp says that reservations are recommended.   Take them at their word.  45 min wait at 11am.  It was worth it!   Excellent service and food.  My wife had the Red Velvet Waffles and I had the eggs crab Benedict."}
{"text":"I met up with a group of friends for dinner at Terrace Cafe to celebrate our friend's birthday a couple of weeks ago. It's hidden in a little niche around the corner from the Harris Express Y, and parking can be a bit difficult depending on the time you arrive. After finding a space and walking into the restaurant, I immediately decompressed. The ambiance was very inviting and our server was wonderful. I've heard great things about the breakfast food at Terrace Cafe, but never anything about dinner. Here are my thoughts:  1. 3/5 stars for the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese. Might be because we are recently back from Charleston where we had such wonderful pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes everywhere we went, but this order seemed a bit bland.   2. 5/5 stars for the biscuits with the butter and delicious jalapeno jelly. Couldn't get enough of these bite sized nuggets.  3. 4/5 stars for the Fennel Pollen Dusted Red Grouper. It was very tasty but a bit soupier than I thought it would be. The serving size was quite large, so I had the remaining for lunch the next day.  4. 5/5 for all the desserts (we each ordered one so had 4 of the 5 options). The serving portions are individually sized, which is great if you just want a little sweet treat without blowing your entire daily caloric budget. You can't go wrong with a dessert at Terrace Cafe!  Last but not least, on Thursday nights they have $5 martinis, which is a great deal in Southpark. All in all, Terrace Cafe is a solid experience for dinner and I'll go back soon, probably for the raved-about breakfast."}
{"text":"I always have a wonderful experiece at Terrace Cafe. From the friendly staff to the kitchen crew, to the coffee bar.  I always have the most complicated orders and taste in food. I change up whatever is on the menu and create my own and being as to how I work for service industry I know how irrtating this can be. The waiter will always smile and say lets see what we can do and 9 times out of 10 pull through. When they can not fulfill they always have a way to still deliver the message without any issues.  Today my friend and I sat at the bar behind the expiditer Ryan Duncan (I believe thats what I read on his chef's coat) and the window to the cooks. They hustled their ass's off, getting food out Hot, sauces on point and out in timely fashion at the peak time of brunch.  My hat off to them, excellent staff overall, food is always fantastic. Great Job Terrace! My bill came out to $36 (I ordered a ton of food) and I left a $26 tip. If I had more I would tip even more. They deserve it!!! I am your biggest fan!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and friends for a birthday brunch, which I thought would be amazing. Firstly, this place is extremely crowded. If we weren't happy to sit at the bar area, we would have had to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated.  When you get to your table, you will notice that all the silverware and bowls/plates are not pieces you can find in your local Macy's.  All the cutlery and bowls are designed to be very curved and give the feeling that you're about to eat in a fancy restaurant. The menu is fairly large and everything is pretty expensive but I ignored the prices and ordered the \"Shrimp and Grits\"  My Shrimp and Grits were spicy, mixed in with what I think were bacon bits, and had a few okras laid out on the top. While it was very unique in its flavors, the combination of spicy, okra-ey, shrimpy, bacon-et, and creamy left me oh-so-slightly nauseous.  I don't want to say it was bad in any way, but I did think it was made to \"wow\" guests rather than to actually be a delicious breakfast.  The past week I had just gone to a place in Davidson called Restaurant X which I thought was spectacular without trying too hard to be \"unique\" so I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed to pay more, and get a less pleasant experience.   On a side tangent, this is the only restaurant I have ever been to that has mouth-wash in its bathrooms.  I felt that the Terrace Cafe is trying too hard to be different, and not trying hard enough to make a delicious meal. It's crowded, a bit pricey, and too experimental to be delicious, and thus I can sadly only give Terrace Cafe only 3-stars for now."}
{"text":"Saw reviews and was excited to try. Eggs cold, \"fresh\" fruit tasted and looked like it was cut days ago, and husband's bacon was cold."}
{"text":"An upscale relaxing and cozy place. I ordered the Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles drizzled with cream cheese with a side bowl of fruit and it was excellent. Chicken was cooked just right and the waffles were so fluffy. It was all very filling. I would definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the Charlotte area thus far.  The venue itself is very nice, spacious, and well designed.  The staff are super friendly.  I always get the full breakfast: pancakes, cheesy grits, scrambled eggs and bacon.  It's a very high quality breakfast.  They use very good ingredients, I can tell.  The coffee here is high octane as well.    WARNING: if you dare try coming here on a weekend, make a reservation well in advance or you will NOT get it.  Ideally, if you can come in during the weekday, that's a much better move. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"My experiences at Terrace have come up a bit mixed. The first time I went it was good and the second time less so.  On both visits I ordered the red velvet waffle with chicken breast. A figured this would make for a very unique chicken and waffles experience. I was not disappointed the first time. The waffle was crisp and glazed in a delicious cream cheese icing and the chicken perfectly fried for a delectable combination. My friend got quiche and while it didn't look anything spectacular, it tasted good. On my more recent visit the waffle was barely cooked - mushy and unsupportive of the chicken. The chicken was not crispy, but otherwise not horrible. The cream cheese glaze was close to non existent.  On my most recent visit the waitress was not friendly at all. Basically she just didn't even care. Never presented us with the specials menu; it was not service with a smile. My friends complained that the shrimp and grits were too salty. I didn't mind them, but admit that it didn't taste cohesive. More like grits plus chili plus shrimp. The mimosas with a \"twist\" are pretty dang good. Like a standard mimosa but with some other kind of juice - creates a cool separation in your glass that's both neat to look at and to drink. Another ding for the waitress - she never once asked my friend if he didn't like his drink (it was still full to the top) or offer to replace it. I felt sort of sorry for her, starting a morning off in such a bad mood.  Inside I feel like the ambiance is a bit awkward. The restaurant feels too open while the food is meant to make it feel cozy. But, what can you do? They're super popular despite the small size and at brunch time you're destined to be waiting to get a table. I won't write them off, but I doubt I'll come back for brunch. I guess they were just overworked with the crowd and it showed in the quality of food and service. I recommend picking a more obscure day and time to eat here."}
{"text":"Biscuits don't get any better. I'm on that Bacon, Egg and Cheese team #basic. If you have a sweet tooth for breakfast, be ambitious and get the Red Velvet Cake Waffle. It's insane!"}
{"text":"Won't be back.  Our party of 6 adults went here for breakfast last Saturday and I was disappointed.  We had really bad service - the waiter brought about 1 oz of cream for 4 people to have in coffee. It's still ok to put cream in coffee, isn't it? Anyone?? After the rough start, it got worse.  Forgotten drinks, cold food and I don't know what the other reviewers see in the grits.  Homemade sausage was flavorless.  Better choice for sausage biscuits and gravy:  Zada Janes in Plaza Midwood. Better choice for cheese grits:  Boudreaux's in NoDa (Sunday brunch.  YUM.)    To their credit, the manager of this place did the right thing when we brought our bad experience to his attention so I feel a little bad about posting this review. But the food, service and atmosphere just didn't live up to the reviews."}
{"text":"After an 11.5 hour drive from South FL, aka SoFlo, we figured we'd stop by a brunch place to perk ourselves back up again. The drive into Charlotte, specifically South Park, was a beautiful experience... like the plaza alone is something I've never seen in SoFlo. And there it is, Terrace Cafe.  I ordered the Red Velvet Chicken & Waffles. It came out more like a rose color instead of the infamous deep red color you see in red velvet cake, but it still tasted just like red velvet, with the sweet cream cheese drizzle to compliment. Despite the drizzle, it wasn't soggy to my surprise. The waffle maintained it's outer crisp and inner fluffiness. The chicken was good, but I've had better. They use boneless chicken, and I'm into the kind you can gnaw on. I had ordered a cheesy grits for my side dish, and I was not impressed. It tasted like regular grits, and I wasn't sure if it had cheese. I should've asked for butter for taste, but there was no point, I didn't finish my waffle and chicken because I got full quick, so I knew I won't finish the grits either.  We ate til we got our fill, and I would consider coming back if I tried other stuff from the menu. Other items did entice me, so if I do hit Charlotte again, I'll consider coming back!"}
{"text":"Parking was a little crazy in the parking garage but worth risking life and limb for this place! I had the braised beef with Brussels sprouts and it was divine! The meat was tender and flavorful and the sprouts were well cooked and equally as good. I got a ton of food for the price (which was very fair given the location) and I would definitely go back again when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am writing this review while I'm sitting here at breakfast (which is probably rude) considering that my breakfast date is looking at me. The atmosphere is really rustic and welcoming. First- it took the server roughly 7 min to even greet us or take our drink order (not terribly an issue) but I do like to be acknowledged in a reasonable amount of time.  The food came from another server who was visible distraught because of how busy she was but the food was amazing. I had the Chicken and Waffles- it was delicious but not the best I have had in Charlotte (that belongs to NAPA). It was priced correctly and the waffle wasn't cold or soggy. The chicken was moist and breaded just the right amount. Overall I was very pleased with the food.   Problem is that- although the food was great- the service was abysmal. My server saw me twice- to take my order and then again after I was done with my food so she can ask if anyone checked on us that entire time. They didn't and I waited 5 min to get syrup. I would have waited longer if my guest hadn't gotten up went to the server station and ask another server for syrup. I would have actually waited until my server came back to the table. The server was apologetic but that wasn't merely enough for not even asking if they got our food correct. It was the first time in almost 7 years that I tipped only 15% of the bill. This was a Thursday morning not Sunday brunch. I was disappointed.  Again- great food but TERRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Delicious ! Nice variety of food perfect for brunch the red velvet waffles are to die for and the cream cheese drizzle puts it over the edge the shrimp in grits are savory and hearty nice portions and great atmosphere get there early on Sunday"}
{"text":"Freaking Fabulous! Went there on a Sunday! I suggest going early or be prepared to wait. Got there around 12:45 pm and it was packed! Waited while I had a mimosa (they were good). I went with my friend and we decided to get two dishes and split them. I got to try more than I would have eating alone! I got the eggs Benedict florentine style and added Canadian bacon. It came with cheese grits on the side. This dish was absolutely delicious. I even enjoyed the grits (I'm a bit skeptical of other states' grits). My friend ordered the red velvet waffles with hash browns as her side item. It was like eating Coke for breakfast! Sooooo good! The hash browns were on point as well! Overall good experience and the waiter was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 star place. I had the lemon poppy french toast - it's more like a lemon pound cake that's been sliced and then pan fried, it's very sweet so it needs fruit to cut the sweetness. It comes drizzled with lemon curd, too! I also ordered a latte - nice and creamy, none of that sour coffee taste. It was expensive for what it was - $20 plus tip for the french toast, extra side of berries and a latte."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst breakfast my family has experienced. We are very familiar with this restaurant and we have no idea what has recently changed. Our Canadian bacon eggs Benedict came out with Crab Cakes, the plain French toast came out as toast without a French toast batter to be seen, the Canadian bacon was super thick, very disappointing bs thingy sliced and crispy, the grits came out with cheese twice we ordered without cheese, the onions added to the top of our hash browns were not grilled and mixed in, the arrived as a glob on top so mushy twice, I sent those back as well.  Not to mention we waited for our meal 40 minutes. We had 5 different people dealing with our table however no where near organized like Famous Toastery one of the 5 we found out was the manager, we didn't realize it. We had to even get up and ask someone for the check. Nothing was resolved for such a disappointing breakfast outing.  We simply had a lady say \"I'm so sorry for all the mix ups.\""}
{"text":"Our waitress was very attentive and friendly during brunch. Since I just recently moved to the south, I had never had chicken and waffles before. She recommended I get that dish with a side of sausage gravy, since I am more a fan of savory dishes than sweet. This dish was absolutely incredible. I have not ordered chicken and waffles anywhere else since this occasion because I am afraid it won't compare!"}
{"text":"2.75 stars  The food in Charlotte left me so underwhelmed. I thought for sure this town would have good food. Honestly, the restaurants in Raleigh-Durham are much better in comparison. Who would have thought!?? But, that is enough of my spiel...  I went to Terrace on my last morning in Charlotte in search of a great brunch near my hotel. Parking was easy, and so was seating. I quickly ordered a peach cider mimosa and the red velvet chicken & waffles. It was good, but not great. The chicken left much to be desired. It was a little burnt and lacked in the seasoning department. Meh. The red velvet waffle was great however! Cooked well throughout and perfectly sweet. The cream cheese icing that they drizzle on top of it is amazing! I was one step away from asking for more lol! This is not someplace I'd think I'd return, but the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Yum. Quiche. Yum.  That was pretty much my conversation with myself the other day during my lunch at Terrace Cafe. And if you're wondering, yes, it was a one-way conversation. I know you're jealous of my communication skillz.  Anywho, Terrace Cafe, a cute little cafe burrowed in the Piedmont Town Center. Truthfully, when I was seated upstairs and took in their menu for a few minutes, I wasn't wowed by their lunch selections. However, my friendly waitress told me about their lunch specials, including a \"healthy\" slab of quiche baked with feta, house roasted turkey, tomatoes, spinach and onions. This $10 special was served with a substantial side of greens and a generous fresh fruit cup.   Um, YUM. I love quiche in general, but this particular slab (not exaggerating here) was creamy, well made and finished with a tasty crust. It was quite a nice portion for a ten spot, especially for lunch. The turkey was ridiculously good and I was really impressed with the quality of the quiche.   I'd really like to come back and give their breakfast/brunch a shot as the red velvet waffles were taunting me."}
{"text":"It is very disappointing to give this place one star because, the food is very very good! However, the last THREE times we have dined here have been disastrous each time. The hostess is unfriendly and cannot quote a wait time properly, the waiters have no sense of urgency and all seem unhappy and other employees seem miserable too. I ordered a fruit platter which was missing coffee cake and half the fruit, our French press only filled half of each coffee cup and we were charged full price for both of these items... we didn't want to ask for anything extra because it was so busy!! Previously we had dined here and service was exceptional along with food quality but they have taken an unfortunate turn for the worse. Despite the great food and dining here more than ten times we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great brunch on Mother's Day!  Thought we would have a long wait but only 20 minutes! Very delicious!  Tried Full Breakfast, Croque Madame, Shrimp and Grits, and Southern Sausage Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise Sauce!  All great!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Terrace Cafe for almost 5 years and it has always been one of my go to spots - until recently. The last 4 times were awful, but I kept coming back hoping that the experience was an anomaly. I've found hair in my food more times than I can count. My food has often come out cold. The waitress/waiter has taken an unbelievably long time to even take our drink order and most recently, a simple water and coffee order was botched. It's hard to justify coming here anymore - even though the food is really good, what's the point in experiencing bad service, cold food, and finding a hair in your eggs."}
{"text":"I love this place! The brunch is well worth the wait. The shrimp & grits are the best around. Fast and very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"I love to have a cafe beverage and veggie omelette from Terrace Cafe. Always a great wait staff and enjoyable time!"}
{"text":"Great Mothers Day brunch. First time at Terrace Cafe but will not be the last. After reading reviews about the Red Velvet Waffles that is what I had to have and they were outstanding. My wife had Cold Water Lobster Benedict. She let me taste it and it was to die for."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!!!! The food was PERFECTION!! The white mocha was thick and delicious. I'll tell you what, this place deserves an award and Tue people that gave it less than 5 stars need to come back and try it again"}
{"text":"Very good all around spot for breakfast and lunch. Great waffles, omelets and pancakes. But if you're looking for something a little more filling, the fried chicken is out of this world.   Expect a wait on the weekends but it usually moves pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Red Velvet Waffles were definitely a winner but I have tried a few more items and they were equally delicious. For me the lemon poppyseed pancakes were on the thicker side very dense but everything else I have had her has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise. I have skipped the place for a while. Just forgot about because it is hidden gem. The trout was outstanding and the service was too. I am always hard to please and they were great. The prices seemed to have come down too. After I had a 20 dollar breakfast I avoided them. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffle is soooooo good!  Will try the chicken and waffles next time... One of my favorite combinations!"}
{"text":"Came here because the person I went with to visit North Carolina was useless in making decisions to practically anything.  I thought I'd go here to try where the locals go.  Glad I went.   I tried the Red Velvet waffles. Mmmmmm, good!!! Drinks were good too. Decor was nice, wait was approx 45 mins and they meant 45 mins.  I guess that's why I placed 4 stars for the long wait but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite brunch spots. The breakfast food is all that I've ever gotten here and it has been great each time. They are helpful if you have a food allergy and ask up front they have been accommodating of that every time that I've been (I can't eat dairy)"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I LOVE this place.  I have been there many mornings (FYI. Gets very busy on Sunday's after church).  There red velvet waffles are to die for! They are very friendly, get you seated reasonably quickly even when you have a decent size party and the service is great."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast places. The staff was super friendly, the wait wasn't long. The sausage gravy biscuit was tasty. Best gravy and biscuit I've ever had. The chicken sausage is also great here. The pricing wasn't bad either. For 5 people (3 adults & 2kids) we paid around $60. I would recommend anyone in town to visit this place. Also, try the red velvet waffle. :) you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was on the border of 3 or four stars and decided that a 3 was too low and a 3.5 wasn't possible so 4 it is. The upside quiet personal dining very attentive service and the food came out very quickly. The cons, I found my omelette to be a tad overcooked and my hash browns a little bland but maybe it was simply I ordered the wrong thing. My girlfriend's chicken and waffles was spectacular. Perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken light crispy and fluffy waffle. This place is definitely worth checking out. And her white mocha latte was great also."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch a few weekends ago - on a Sunday, the food was pretty solid..the waitress was ok. We waited about 25 minutes but it was worth it, I'd definitely go back. They also had mimosas and other brunch drinks that were delish."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast. Came here for dinner on Saturday night and it was pretty empty. Ordered the crab cake hush puppies and they were almost burnt and lacked flavor. The gnocchi was ok, just a lot of pasta and not enough mushrooms. Would go again for breakfast but not for dinner again."}
{"text":"Went there for birthday brunch.  Food was very good and lots of options as a vegetarian.  Waitress was very friendly and helpful.   Deducted one star because we tried calling for 4 days in a row at various times, emailing, and using the online private dining and reservation link and no one ever got back to us.  Didn't even answer the phone (two of us tried over and over).  Somehow ran out of breakfast staples, but what we did get everyone was very pleased with.  Had people coming in from an hour and a half away specifically for brunch, so we wanted to make sure we knew we had a table the process.  Ended up waiting outside for an hour.  Will definitely go again, just would like the phones/emails to be answered."}
{"text":"Terrace was pretty good! Though the restaurant is pretty big, This place gets super crowded on the weekends for brunch so I suggest going early. I am not sure if they take reservations.  I ordered the chef's special skillet.... amazing! They give you a ton of food and prices are reasonable. I will def be back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and worth the price. I definitely order a la carte style here. The hosts, sadly, are usually always rude. The servers make up for it though because they are all very delightful. Little things but they make a difference. I love how y'all make your own jam for your delicious biscuits and have the big tea pots. My mom loves the Benedict but slow down on the salt you add to hashbrowns. Overall, love this place."}
{"text":"Carefully and meticulously prepared food in a casual setting ... surprisingly so actually. Service is attentive and excellent making this a sure thing for future trips to the area"}
{"text":"What don't they have? I'm never disappointed in this resturant. Nice atmosphere, great service, delicious food."}
{"text":"I would have gave this place 5 stars but our server..was horrible. His attitude was very obvious that he did not want to be there. He gave us a couple of different names so we could not remember him. We asked what was good on the menu. He said I dont know! I only work the AM shift. Wtf? We came in after 5pm. But the food was.good. The ribs, crab soup were good."}
{"text":"After reading the positive review  for Terrace Cafe in Charlotte Magazine, my hubby and I knew we had to try them for breakfast.  And not only are really glad we did, we expect to return often (even though it's a bit of hike for us)!    Just be forewarned that you should expect a wait. Terrace Cafe is totally worth the wait, though. They are also very efficient, so our expected 30-minute wait for a table on a Sunday turned into just 20 minutes.  To start, they have a full espresso bar with options that few other restaurants have -- like the white chocolate blackberry mousse latte that my husband got, or the pumpkin spice latte that I got. Both were yummy, but the pumpkin was a tad sweeter than my hubby's white chocolate blackberry.    For the meal, I got the red velvet waffle with cream cheese topping and fruit. I loved the fact that the fruit was served room temperature and not ice cold, like I usually get it. The fruit was also a nice selection of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, melon, and kiwi. The waffle was a perfect-sized portion but could have used a bit more cream cheese topping. (I like my toppings sweet!) I'll probably ask for an extra bit the next time.    My hubby got the full breakfast with two fried eggs, bacon, hash browns, and chocolate chip pancakes. The choco pancakes were light and delicious and probably my favorite thing out of everything we got.  I also loved that they served the syrup heated. What a nice touch! We were both really impressed by the entire meal. (And did I already say the coffee was yummy? I swear, bad coffee can absolutely destroy a good meal!)  Service was really quick, and we did not have to wait long for the meal to arrive. Our server was also extremely attentive and checked back with us several times to make sure we were happy. We really appreciated that.  It's great that Terrace Cafe is open for breakfast on both Saturdays and Sundays.  So few places in Charlotte offer breakfast on Saturdays!  They have the winning combination of great coffee, delicious food, and quick and attentive service...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner at the restaurant known for brunch.  The food and service was great.  I have food allergies and they went above and beyond to make sure I had a good, allergy-free meal."}
{"text":"Hits the spot for breakfast or brunch! You may have to wait to sit on the weekends... But, that's a good sign."}
{"text":"Celebrating our anniversary weekend, we started at Terrace Café for brunch on a Satruday morn.  We didn't expect for it to be busy, but it WAS!  NOT a big deal since we were only a party of two and our wait time was only 5 minutes tops.  We sat upstairs in the terrace area and it was perfect.  Coffee was delish and my egg white omelet  was really good.  I can't believe I've never tried Terrace Café.  Great location, great food, good price....what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was amazing staff was friendly and the shrimp and grits were great. Also try the fried green tomatoes"}
{"text":"Tried Terrace cafe for a Sunday breakfast/brunch. Had heard many rave reviews so perhaps I was overly excited. Service was very good but just a tad slow (I can understand that it was very busy). Ordered the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese as an appetizer. They were good but seemed to have been previously frozen (a couple were cold in the center). Had the southern sausage eggs Benedict. The sausage was excellent. It was served with a biscuit instead of an English muffin, which I love, but the biscuit was kinda tough. Hash browns were very good as well. I was impressed but not over the moon about it like some reviews I had heard. I would definitely give it another try and would even recommend it to others but there is room from some slight improvements."}
{"text":"Drove all the way down here because I heard they had the best brunch in Charlotte... but my food was comparable to an IHOP. Couldn't even drink the OJ ($4.15) because it tasted worse than what I drink at hotel vending machines. The wait was way too long so we thankfully grabbed bar seats. Really not worth the drive for my omelette and hash browns. Although their homemade jam was good on my buttered biscuit... the only highlight of my visit. And the good service."}
{"text":"Great brunch!! Fresh, delicious ingredients.  Service can be a little slow.  A lot of items are pricey, but mostly worth it because of the flavor."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having brunch here. The food was delicious and the coffee was great. However, it didn't seem like the wait staff could handle the large crowd that comes for a Sunday brunch. Our waiter seemed flustered and kept forgetting about us. The hostess was even a little rude and short tempered. They didin't seem understaffed so I'm not sure what the deal was. I would definitely go back here but it would be nice if they had better servers who could handle more than a couple of tables. For this reason I gave Terrace 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"The food was extremely awesome. The service was good. Wait time for food a little bit slow but worth to wait. Over all awesome"}
{"text":"S'mores French Toast. I'm tempted to leave it at that, but I guess not everyone is as taken away with sweet and gooey breakfast goodness.   It was Sunday morning around 10 and we probably should have opted for a faster meal so as to get on with our 11 hour drive, but we (I?) wanted a tasty breakfast. With Yelp as my guide, we set off to Terrace Cafe. First off, the parking garage is a wonderful convenience, it's not creepy or smelly like some can be and free, as well as perfectly located so finding a spot was stress-free, at least on Sunday morning. I mention this because one of my most common culprits of a ruined day is fighting over parking. The restaurant is a classy, fun cafe, with the restaurant seating taking most of the facility, with a decent bar at the enterance. The bathroom is clean and updated, and oddly well supplied (mouthwash?). The tables are all adorned with NASA issued salt & pepper shakers (or at least they remind me of space travel) and spiffy utensils. Enough about the scenery. The food is what we were hungry for, and a quick glance of the menu led me totally devoted to s'mores french toast. A sweet smell of amusement parks accompanied the three thick slices of fried (unconfirmed) french toast, smothered in marshmallow goo and chocolate sauce topped with graham crackers. I easily removed the crumbles (I'm not a graham fan), and quickly forked in. I savored each bite until I could eat no more. And I was sad. Because there was still one more piece. And I wanted it. It was so good. But I had to leave it, and it made me sad. My fellow breakfasters had Banana Pecan french toast, waffle w/strawberry, and hash browns, all of which they were very pleased (especially the french toast). The coffee was weak/bitter, but they offer espresso drinks as well so that might have been a better selection (though... if they can't get drip coffee right, I don't have tons of hope in the mochas). The service was friendly and prompt, nothing outstanding, but definitely no complaints.   Oh, and there was a note in the menu regarding only serving breakfast, I'm not sure if that's just Sundays or weekends."}
{"text":"I have been a few times, but haven't gotten around to writing my review. Can we say SHRIMP & GRITS? One of their most popular dishes is the red velvet waffles and chicken-also equally good. Each time I have went, there was a wait unless you opt to sit at the bar. You will have to see them prepare all the food through the window to the kitchen, which for me takes the fun out of it, but it definitely doesn't take away from the taste. Get there early to avoid a line but GO!"}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast spot to bring out-of-town visitors to. Families as well as couples will enjoy it.  Ask to sit upstairs, it's a nice view.  Coffee is great and so are their hash browns...so good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time yesterday and we will be back frequently. We both agree it was one of the best breakfasts we've had in a long time. I had the filet benedict and she had an omelette both were excellent. Everything was very fresh and had a nice homemade quality to it. Next time I'm going to give the red velvet waffle a shot."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Quoted a 30min wait. At 45 mins we were at the stand to inquire about additional wait time. We were seated shortly after.   Service: Initial service was delayed as they had cleared our section and sat everyone at the same time so our waitress did the best she could.  Food:I opted for the red velvet waffle and chicken. Both were good enough although the chicken was a little bland for my liking.   Overall, I'd return if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Very good simple breakfast in Charlotte. The service was cool and the food was satisfactory. I can't say I was overly impressed, but maybe it's because I didn't get the red velvet waffle that everyone raved about (after we left of course). The food was good, I'll likely come back to try out the waffle and get a better impression of everything."}
{"text":"Loved brunch here. My friend and I ordered the lemon poppyseed french toast and the strawberry cream french toast. The service was speedy (even on a busy Sunday morning) and our waitress was very friendly. Would recommend visiting here if you are in Charlotte and looking for a tasty place for brunch in the South Park area."}
{"text":"We stoped into Terrace Cafe for brunch on a Monday afternoon. We were promptly greeted and quoted a 20 minute wait time. After about 5-7 minutes we were sat and greeted by our server, Julie. It seemed as though Ms. Julie was a little overwhelmed by being sat multiple times in a row, but she still provided decent service. Our food came out in a little over 10 minutes. We ordered a Full Breakfast with grits, bacon, scrambled eggs and a Belgium waffle( substituted for two pancakes). As well as the Lemon Poppyseed French Toast with a side of cheesy stone grits and bacon.   Both meals were served piping hot and were very delicious!   I must say we enjoyed almost everything from the food to the restaurants classy, but relaxed atmosphere! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I wish they took weekend brunch reservations. But I went with a party of six and everything was very good. Chicken and waffles, red velvet waffle, French toast, all good. I was perturbed that the daily drink special was a $4 Bloody Mary that they were somehow out of at noon on a Sunday, though. That lost them a star. But overall it was an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"We generally try all independent brunch places on weekends to support local chef's. We are sorry to say we will not be supporting them again. Our wait wasn't long and the server was fine. However eggs benedict was TERRIBLE. Absolutely no flavor in the hollandaise  sauce and the meat had less. Come on meat in the south without flavor seriously.  Now this might not be what they are known for and you are thinking why would you go here if that was your order however when you go to a place that specializes in variety plates someone in the party might just want classics. I had the lemon poppy seed French toast. Very over powering and sweet. Even for me who will go out on a limb and try creative plates. OH coffee was good that is why the second star."}
{"text":"The steak seems getting smaller but the flavor is still there. The Texas chili bowl is tasty"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte and lunch/dinner is great too! I've been to both locations but I go to the Southpark location more often since I live there. I've loved everything from biscuits and gravy to the Y Omlet. It is a little pricier than some local breakfast joints but let's be honest, it is worth it. They do a lot of fresh ingredients which is a huge plus in my mind."}
{"text":"It's really good. The best part is that they have a dinner menu which has the red velvet waffle on it. So you can let the rest of Charlotte  fight it out with the lunch crowds, while you sit back and relax with a nice dinner without having to wait in any line."}
{"text":"Recently, I was asked to head over to Terrace Café and I must say that I was reluctant to do so.  I usually avoid cafés, especially new and modern ones, as I always feel that I am not part of their target demographic.  Atmosphere - Bright, Clean, Open, IKEA-ish, Funky Drink Glasses (that I have seen before...I know I have) and Fake Wood menus (not sure where that comes from)?  Food - While their menu has an extensive breakfast listing, I opted for lunch...a healthy one...and an apparently charitable one.  I ordered the Fruit Salad w/ chicken, one of the two YMCA nutritionist approved items (look for the black and red \"Y\") with a portion of the sale going to the YMCA.  This way I ate healthy and felt good about myself...wow, I am a great person!  This salad is very similar to the one I enjoy at the now Chapter 11-filed Max & Erma's.  This salad, like M&E's consists of mixed greens, grilled chicken, pecans, blue cheese, apples, and grapes, which is then topped with some red (or pink) raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  As the norm for me, I asked for the dressing on the side...it is healthier...wow, I am smart too.  The chicken was just okay as it tasted like they wiped the \"black char\" off the grill with it.  I mean it had the grill marks that I expected but it was also pretty much smeared with black grill soot (I doubt that the nutritionist approved that!).  The portion size of the salad was fine to a little on the skimpy side.  The dressing, while it was pink (see second sentence in this review), was all right and not too sweet.  Overall, it was a decent salad for lunch.   Service - Hmmm...okay the place was busy and it was lunchtime...the order was received as placed...water filled once...it was...15% tip type service.  Price - Salad $11.  For the quantity of the grilled chicken given in the salad...go to Max & Erma's.  Then again, maybe that is why they are going broke.  Overall - The menu did have several other items listed that seemed interesting.  Okay, would I go here again... maybe...maybe with a date...like a lunch date?  Now, I must go drink a beer and work on my car or something manly...pink dressing...um, what???"}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on Sunday. The food was perfect and came out very quickly. Attentive service and comforting ambiance. I will always recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have got to say I love this place! I have taken the family (2 boys plus hubby) for breakfast a couple of times, had lunch there twice, and dinner one time. Each was a wonderfully memorable experience.    I wanted to comment on my most recent experience during Queen's Feast week. It was simply amazing! My husband ordered the pork chop and it had the most wonderful glaze on it! He also ordered the chicken lollipops. I know my boys will want to order this appetizer when we return. It was very much like wings, but much more meat. It's served with blue cheese dressing, so we'll ask for ranch for them.  I had the fried chicken and being a Southern girl, it was absolutely perfect! The green beans were cooked the way my daddy liked them (very soft) and the garlic mashed potatoes were a treat. I am not used to eating spicy things so the gravy was a little much for me but a nice compliment overall. Chicken was cooked to perfection. I wish I could prepare it so well!  Service was impeccable. Oh, I almost forgot dessert! I chose a peanut butter cheesecake and hubby picked the lemon delicious thing. Wow, I want to go back and eat that lemon thing every day this week!    They did not skimp on portion size unlike some restaurants during the promotional week. We were stuffed and happy to have tried some new items.  The atmosphere is very relaxed but upscale too. You could go in an nice outfit for dinner or stop by in golf clothing for lunch.  We have seen both.   Definitely go to this place. It is a hidden jewel and deserves to be very successful."}
{"text":"Just in case you were wondering, Terrace Cafe is still awesome. The servers are friendly and quick. The Bacon Bloody Mary is still the best in the city and the breakfast is worth the wait.   If you want a pro tip, come early on the weekends. I met a friend for brunch recently at 9:00 am and we were seated immediately. And no one judges you for drinking early."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful post Patty's day breakfast at Terrace. We were seated quickly and received service in a timely manner. Savana was our server and she blew us away with her great attitude and vast knowledge of the menu. She guided us through our picks and made us feel great about our choices. Our food came out so fast and was absolutely delicious. I had the green waffle with a cream cheese drizzle, house made sausage, and cheddar cheese grits. My boyfriend had the full breakfast which included two eggs, country potatoes, chicken apple sausage, and banana pancakes. We loved every bite and the whole experience was phenomenal from start to finish. Thank you Savana! You are the best. We will absolutely be returning to this great South Park restaurant."}
{"text":"my favorite brunch spot. you will have to wait unless you are there at like 930am, but its worth it. get a latte, fruit cup, hash browns, waffle or benedict. the oyster salad and she crab soup are AWESOME."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. We were in town for the weekend and my sister happened to google this place because she wanted chicken and waffles. She ended up getting the red velvet waffles and chicken. I had the quiche of the day. It was made with sausage,onions,tomatoes,spinach, and cheese. It was fabulous.  Generally, it comes with a side of greens and fruit. I substituted the fruit for hashbrowns. Everything was wonderful. The food came out rather quickly and our waitress was very friendly. I would definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner only: We went for dinner mid-week. It was my first time here, and I found the ambiance cold (literally & figuratively). Waiter and manager were both very friendly and attentive. We were pleased to see they now offer breakfast all day long (always a plus when it's fresh and tasty).   However, we were sad to see their dinner & lunch menu seemed a bit watered down. This is clearly a great place for breakfast, brunch & lunch - dinner, not so much. I'm told they used to have a delicious pork chop entree - but it's completely gone from the menu and the kitchen (we asked). I ordered the soup of the day (basil tomato) which was really great! I also got the chicken salad with a \"large scoop\" of the chicken salad on top of the sweet salad. Large scoop? I don't think so, it was a very small amount of chicken salad and it was basically a little white meat chicken, with bland mayonnaise and a few small pieces of pineapple. Boring, small and disappointing. We also were expecting some kind of bread or role with dinner that was supposedly really good and typically provided. It never came at all.   My friend ordered the chicken & grits which is 'normally amazing.' Instead, it was greasy (a burgundy colored ring and pools of grease with seasoning pooled her dish), and she had one huge glop of melted cheese - it was actually impressive, but not in a good way. My other friend ordered the crab cake BLT, which was fairly tasty in reality. It had a horseradish flavor throughout, so if you don't like that, beware. Desert time came, and we were ready for our peanut butter pie! They were looking forward to it all week. We ordered it, and the waiter joked, \"Great, where's the peanut butter pie coming from?\"   We thought he was teasing us, but we learned they keep changing the menu and completely did away with the peanut butter pie. Saddened, we skipped desert and paid. Food was OK at best, but amid their seeming transformation at the moment, they're a bit lost. We probably won't return to this frigid (temperature), drab (ambiance) and lackluster menu. Staff was good, but the food was a miss. Not bad, but not as good as it should have been. Seems they're trying to figure out who they are as a restaurant outside of breakfast... hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"Oh yea, baby.  On our continuation of exploring Sunday brunch places, we put our names in at the South Park location (sits in that little circle of restaurants off the beaten path) and were told 45 minutes, which we were expecting. We wandered over to Cast Iron Waffles (also on the list) and checked out the menu there, just to be gluttons for punishment and torture our already-rumbling stomachs.  Anyways, after about a half hour, we were seated. Gorgeous interior, two stories and wicked high ceilings. After deliberation and compromise, I decided that I was going to get the Lemon Poppyseed French Toast, while the Lady would order the Banana Pecan French Toast. We both thought they looked delicious, so we thought we'd eat half and then trade.  Bad decision.  The lemon poppyseed toast was out of this world! It was super moist and had an incredible flavor, and the berries that went with it were a fantastic compliment. The banana pecan was good, don't get my wrong. But wowww.   I was in a group of 6 and I don't think there was a single complaint. The benedicts looked wonderful, chicken and waffles was a really generous portion. Will definitely be back again to try out other things. Prices are reasonable for Sunday brunch, comparable to Toast I'd say. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you that there are not too many restaurants out there who let patrons come in 10 minutes before closing but they did. The serve staff were excellent and for that and the fact they make fantastic food puts them as my go to restaurant of all time. I had the Eggs Benedict with crab cakes...love devine people  I've been back three times now and working my way through the menu."}
{"text":"I have visited both this location and the Ballantyne Location on several locations and have enjoyed myself every time. I always order the chicken and red velvet waffles. The presentation is beautiful. The last time I visited, I took my toddler daughter who dropped several things on the floor throughout our visit. Our server kept picking them up without complaint and I was grateful. I haven't had a bad server yet. My only complaint is that space is a bit tight in both restaurants, but especially the one on Piedmont Row. As much as I try to avoid crowds, their best time, in my opinion, is brunch, so I look past that because I know I'll get a great meal. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as always, service was TERRIBLE. Stopped for brunch.. walked in the door and there were leaves all over the entrance (no biggie wind blowing, its fall).. that mess just carried on into the dining room. There was straw wrappers and a straw on the floor the entier HOUR we were there... tables sat dirty for long periods of time, the table we were sat at was 1/2 wiped off (the 1/2 closest to the end)... our server took our order and NEVER came back... the runner brought the food, I could have used some ketchup but nobody came by to refill drinks or check on us... eventually the server came back to see if we needed anything (we were done eating) and we asked for the check. The staff there appeared young and not very experienced, there were two hostesses and it appeared their job was to clear tables and clean the dining room... our server didnt seem to have a clue wondering around the dining room. We were there an hour due to the slow service... I noticed a lot of other tables sitting and waiting for boxes/checks. Anyways, the food, BF had shrimp and grits which is his usual... excellent as always, I took ONE bite and got a piece of shell, yuck. I had a BEC biscuit which was excellent.. the biscuits were defiantely made in house and super huge fluffy and delishious. It was too bad the service had to put a damper on our otherwise great meal"}
{"text":"I'm writing the review as I'm sitting at the booth. I was really excited to try this restaurant but I know I will NEVER be coming back. The waitress was nice (Jennifer) however she had no idea what she was doing. She never brought us straws or silverware we had to ask for both. When our food finally arrived it was cold and we were missing hash browns. Jennifer said they would be right out however they never came. after 25 mins I asked for the manager and he brought them back in two mins. The manager even said \"that is the easiest dish to get\" After all that we were informed that the credit card machine was down so we waited an additional 20 minutes. This place is overpriced for the poor quality and service. Save your money."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Southpark. Very crowded when I went on a Sunday so expect to wait a bit, but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is literally always packed on the weekends for brunch. You have to get their early! I've been for brunch on several occasions and have yet to be disappointed. They have amazing coffee, which I think they said was from the Dilworth coffee company. Their eggs Benedict is fabulous and so is their special: red velvet waffles. So good! I've also been for restaurant week for dinner and that was amazing too! A great brunch spot, but don't underestimate them for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch. On Sundays, the line for a table is super long, but luckily for me, my boyfriend made reservations. We were immediately seated and our orders were taken. Although the waitress took quite some time to bring our drinks, the customer service was overall good.   I ordered the red velvet chicken and waffle with a side of cheese grits. The red velvet waffle was really good and the cream cheese icing on the waffle was not overly sweet, so it was perfect. The chicken was crisp and well seasoned. I asked for cheddar cheese on the grits but I could tell that it was American cheese, but it still wasn't bad... I ate all of it. The peach moscato punch i ordered Was terrible. It almost tasted like a mildly flavored beer. the red velvet  waffle itself was $11 but if you get chicken added that's an additional $6... I find this strange because generally people order chicken and waffles together so the up charge shouldn't be so high but other than that, I have no real complaints."}
{"text":"Little bit on the pricey side, but the food is delicious! I had the fruit platter with yogurt and warm coffee cake, while my husband got chicken and waffles. We stopped after a doctors appointment next door. Great atmosphere and friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"The Southern Chicken Sandwich was the perfect combination of spicy & sweet. It is the best breakfast sandwich that I've ever had!   We went on Sunday for brunch which is a busy time. The waitstaff was slower than I expected and we had to wait for one member of our party to get their mimosa for 15 minutes while ours were served to us fairly quickly. We had to remind our waitress 3x that we needed one more. We were only a party of 4.   We were all satisfied with our meals but I think my dish was the best."}
{"text":"I frequent this place when I'm out on the weekends and want some breakfast/brunch. It's nice and the food is delicious. Most times I sit at the bar and they've been cool. Service has been great. Today though I couldn't because the competition for a bar seat was stiff. As I am waiting though I notice they were taking parties that came in after me. First 2 parties of two (one that put their name on the list immediately after me), then a party of 4. It wasn't until I said something about it that they decided to look for a table stating they were waiting for a two top to open. What do you mean? 2 parties of two that entered that door after me were just seated at a two and a four top. It would be one thing if they had call ahead seating but Terrace does not. Yeah I get that servers typically don't want to wait on a party of 1 but it's not about them. It's about the customer. Puts a bad taste in my mouth that they didn't feel they need to seat in the order I came in whether I was one or two ppl. I'd get it if I had 3 or more ppl and you needed a larger table but they literally could've sat me anywhere in the restaurant as a single party. Might have to find a new breakfast spot that's on my side of town."}
{"text":"Had shrimp and grits- amazing!  Great service. It was packed for a Friday lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed celebrating my birthday here with friends at brunch. The red velvet waffle is perfection. I would recommend that to anyone. It was surprisingly soft & spongy, while tender at the same time. The flavors were perfect. I had shrimp & grits & the flavors there were great as well- kind of remenecent of fajitas. While I loved the shrimp & grits I do think they were in need of a texture variant. It a BIG bowl of soft, kind of mushiness... i didn't think the shrimp & okra alone provided enough texture. A friend offered me her toast & I thought that worked great with the grits (they should consider always serving it with toast) Mimosas- while I wouldn't say they're worth the $8, I still thought they were nice. The poppy seed French toast- while I loved the flavors of that, I found the poppy seed in the toast I could've done without. Service was great, bathrooms were small but nice & clean. Overall, I loved it & will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Got the 1/2 sandwich and soup......very good.....they made to many red velvet waffles so our table got one for FREE.....OMG THE BOMB"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and Michael gave us EXCELLENT SUGGESTIONS for brunch items! All of the staff was attentive even though we were necessarily \"their\" customers. The Monte Cristo and crab Benedict were outstanding along with a great cucumber cocktail. Super impressed by the food and by the professionalism of all the staff."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an understaffed day or a bad day in general. I arrived on a beautiful Wednesday around noon craving breakfast after reading the rave reviews. The decor was lovely- the general ambiance was very intimate and upscale without being stuffy. The hostess and server were okay. Not the nicest and friendliest but not the worst service either. Downfall was that it was extremely loud even though we were seated upstairs.  My boyfriend loved his bacon waffle with fried chicken and a side of fruit. He wished that there was more bacon inside the waffle, but he did thoroughly enjoy it. I had a lot of problems with my food. I ordered a cappuccino (yummy!), the strawberry pancakes, side of fruit, and 2 sunny side up eggs. I could tell my food was ready first and sat for a while because the strawberries inside the pancakes made the pancakes soggier than they should have been- they were also lukewarm but I was starving so I just ate them. My eggs were also stone cold and I had to send then back. I can't comprehend how kitchen staff can send out cold eggs; sunny side up eggs are the easiest type of eggs to cook! After waiting so long on my meal the first time, I didn't even want to waste more time getting a replacement side for the eggs. Our meal came out to $32 which wasn't too bad at all.   Maybe I'm a little biased since I work in a restaurant myself and am super critical due to that. I've had a better breakfast at IHOP than here and that's saying a lot! I will probably try to come here again on a weekend and try to get the amazing, delicious food that everyone else has enjoyed since I have apparently missed out on a good thing."}
{"text":"The red velvet waffle was excellent as advertised. Both my kids loved it. I had classic eggs Benedict and a side of cheese grits. The food was good, but not great."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Service was relatively fast for a moderately busy Saturday morning. Though no lines when we arrived at 9am. Velvet waffles were good but wouldn't return just for those. Restaurant does have a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! The chicken and waffles are to die for...even my child's dinosaur pancakes were delish! Can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  They are a little pricey, but totally worth it for food that is actually really good."}
{"text":"My friends and I were on a trip down to Charlotte and decided we needed to find a brunch restaurant.  With the help of Yelp (our go to tool), we were able to locate the Terrace Cafe.  From the outside the restaurant looks like a small storefront, but when you open the doors you can really see how grand the place is.  We were seated on the second floor and immediately greeted by our server.  Looking at the menu, I was impressed by the array of options.  We ordered the onion rings and red velvet waffle as an appetizer (not exactly logical, but delicious).  The onion rings are tempura battered and obviously fresh made, honestly some of the best I've ever had.  For my entree I ordered the smores french toast.  Let's be serious, I can't say no to anything smores.  It was a very heavy dish but well worth the caloric splurge.  My friends tried the typical brunch fare and were all very happy with their choices.  Looking over at the diners next to us we saw the sweet potato waffle fries, they looked phenomenal.  I was tempted to ask for a taste but I've heard rumors that would be inappropriate behavior.  I'd definitely recommend checking out Terrace Cafe.  The price is right, the ambiance is fantastic, and the service was quick and entertaining."}
{"text":"Usually terrace cafe is packed and the wait is long but today it was kind of empty (prob because of the weather). We walked in and it took them a little while to sit us even tho it was kind of empty. Today I ordered the chicken Cesar salad which was amazing. Everything was on point. The people I was with ordered food as well with a side of fries but these fries were different from the ones we are accustomed of getting. We asked the waiter when did they change them and he said it changes all the time. Other than that and them not having any dr. Pepper everything was great"}
{"text":"Our hotel recommend this place for breakfast. We ate here 4 days in a row. The steak and eggs were excellent. Meat was tender and the pancakes are fluffy. Everything we had was excellent. We would recommend this place for breakfast. Every server was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Heard of this place plenty of times, didn't really know what to expect.  Since we're trying to avoid mad traffic in the Dilworth area due to Greek Festival, my friend and I headed to Piedmont Row for brunch instead.  Granted I didn't have expectations, I guess I'm just one of those people who aren't easily impressed.    Decor/atmosphere: simple, cafe-like, bright and appealing, causal dressy if that's such a thing... nice high ceiling showcasing the upper level seating... feel bad for food runners who have to climb those stairs   Menu: extensive breakfast/lunch options, maybe a little too extensive because it was hard to make a decision.  Most items are low to mid $10s during breakfast/brunch/lunch time  Food: I'm a soup freak... can't pass on a blue crab bisque.  It was creamy, lumps of yummy fresh crab meat, and OMG salty!  That's an achievement of its kind for me to think something is high sodium (maybe not a good kind of achievement).  Finished it still... but really could have held back the salt.  I ordered the Fried Oysters Spinach Salad... the thing is HUGE.  I swear there's a pound of spinach in that bowl.  Tons of oysters.  Impressive looking.  But unfortunately they went too heavy handed on the vinaigrette.  The menu said hot bacon vinaigrette.  As much as you and I know, it's easy to taste bacon.  Somehow they managed to cover up all things bacon, caramelized onions & sauteed mushrooms... the main reasons I ordered the salad besides the oysters.  The oysters didn't disappoint...  but not enough to save the dish.  For $12.50, it's a big portion, but I can't say the taste justify for it.  Service:Ok.  Little slow on the water refill.  Coffee was amazing though.  Reminded me of Italy.   In conclusion, I was little disappointed by the food.  I know they're known for their red velvet waffle... but I should be able to order something else that isn't sweet and still be yummy.  The menu is a little pricey for \"cafe\" (especially for dinner).  Another good looking place in Charlotte that didn't deliver in the food department."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The menu pricing was extremely affordable. They delivered the food approximately 5-10min. after we placed our order. I tried the \"Lemon Poppy French Toast\" and my friend had the \" Florentine Egg Benedict.\" My friend loved her meal. Her eggs were a little more funny than she expected. I enjoyed my French toast; however, it felt like I was eating cake instead of an actual French toast.   The service was decent considering how busy the facility was. Unfortunately, they do not accept reservations so I'd plan to be there at least 30min.-1hr. prior to the time you are hoping to eat. I will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"The food here was good but nothing on the menu was stand-out. The eggs benedict with crab cakes was okay but the cheesy grits, fried green tomatoes, and chicken waffle were pretty good. The service was decent but the ambiance of the place was pretty lame. Overall, it was a decent experience but not amazing."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food especially for brunch!! Their Banana Nut French Toast is to die for (it's worth a picture but totally dove in and started eating before I remembered to take one)!  A few things to know which is the reason for the four stars is that vegetarian options are limited and it can have a very lengthy wait. It's not advertised well but we found out that the bar and the tables right at the door are first come first serve which might help with the wait if you are a small party."}
{"text":"Yum. I brought Mrs here for brunch on the way to food shopping and it was a hit. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived and there was a line even to give names to the hostess, but the bar had open seats and we just went over to there and ordered immediately.  She had the lemon poppy French toast and while she said the flavor was there, it was less like eggy bread and more like eggy cake. Very sweet and the berries on top were great. Especially so since they were more room temperature and not frozen like they'd just come from the cooler.  I had the florentine benedict. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and popped when cut. The muffin underneath was a little underdone but the spinach was excellent. LOVED THE HOME FRIES. The fried onion strings on top were an interesting garnish.  We also got a \"half order\" of a biscuit and sausage gravy. This was really yummy with a nice peppery gravy that had lots of sausage bits and a good fluffy biscuit underneath.  Good choice for breakfast!"}
{"text":"#1 place for brunch in Charlotte.  Love the hash browns, their fruit platter comes with raspberries/kiwi/blackberries (YUM), the Bloody Mary's have real bacon, their Red Velvet Waffle is a-may-zing, the Steak & Eggs is darn good, their Croque Madame is noble, the S'mores French Toast is yummy, the Banana Pecan French Toast is freaking awesome, and next on my list to try are the Quiche or an Omelet but I haven't been able to stay away from my tried and true faves.  This place is delish; my only regret is that I haven't been for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Recently I went here for lunch and was optimistic when I saw the menu. I found the food to be good but nothing special and the service to be a bit on the slow side. I will go back, but I won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first AND last time to visit this restaurant:( One of the wines had turned and had to go back. The food was extremely slow in coming out to the table, and then 2 items were ice cold.  There was one server for the entire room. The poor server did her best with a smile on her face, but this was unfair to her and all the tables.  We were dining with people who have eaten there more than several times in the past and were dumbfounded to explain what was happening. I know it was just a meal, but $240 later--it did matter!"}
{"text":"I am going to say this up front from the start, best omelette I have ever had my life.  Tomato, spinach and turkey.  Wow, wow, wow.  The wheat toast was fresh and crisp and the fruit cup had fresh blackberries in it.  I have never seen that.  Add some unique dinnerware a friendly staff and great ambiance and you have the makings of one of the best breakfast spots in the Charlotte area.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte for brunch. There is usually a wait time and they don't take reservations for brunch over the phone. Their food portions are huge and the coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We've come here twice and both times had great weekend breakfast experiences.  If you can catch the quiche, it's fantastic... Add the cheesy grits and it's even better.  Also a fan of the berry split.... Loads of fresh fruit and granola with a side of coffee cake puts it over the top.  Both times we had a short wait but the crowd is a nice mix of people and the staff is friendly.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"Well the parental units and I hit up the Terrace on Sunday...   I really had a hard time with this establishment, I was on the fence, so a weak 3 it is.   We only had about a 25 minute wait -- I was surprised they made us purchase coffee while waiting, and then not offering us refills.... It's the purchasing the coffee, its the not offering free refills, are you kidding me? Rude.   Then the next thing was the noise level -- damn was it loud in there. My mother almost wanted to leave. It was really bad and it ruins your meal when you're straining to listen -- they really need some sound proofing as everything bounces of the ceiling and walls.   Over all the food was just OK -- nothing pretty and nothing spectacular. Mom was happy that they offered REAL \"hash browns\". I had the filet Benedict - never again will I have steak in the morning, it was good, but like I said, ok. They really scrimped on the hollandaise sauce and the eggs were a bit underdone.... Dad had some sort of french toast thing with a side of sausage patties - I tried the sausage patty - it was yummy.   Mother had the bacon, egg, Cheddar breakfast sandwich on a biscut. She said the biscut was good, that the scrambled eggs were dry, and that the bacon had NO flavor - WHAT? Are you freaking killing me... how do you fuck up bacon. What kind of pigs were slaughtered...   So would we go back for breakfast, NO, and that is a FIRM no.   I may go back to try a bloody mary and their steak salad, but not anytime soon.   Sorry Terrace for the coin we shelled out, it just wasn't worth it nor memorable."}
{"text":"Only been during breakfast and lunch and the staff was good and so was the food. Overall, nice place for brunch but the wait can be crazy."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this restaurant for dinner. They have been serving dinner for 4 months. Prior to that they were just open for breakfast and lunch. I hear their brunch is really special.  I like the place, nice people, excellent servers, comfortable surroundings. Unusually friendly staff. I was dining alone and they made me feel like I was partying with them.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin with Succotash and Fingerling Potatoes. The pork was cooked to perfection. Many restaurants over cook pork and it gets tough. This dish was outstanding. Great sauces, flavors, etc.  I like their condensed menu where they focus on being good at a select number of item instead of the all things to all people approach.  I will be back to try another entree. Visit this place and give them support. They are trying to launch their dinner menu and could use the business so give them a try.. Good price/value."}
{"text":"My first time here today and went with girlfriends for brunch. It was a Saturday morning and pretty busy. Took about 45 minutes to get a table around 10:30 am and everyone needs to be there before you'll be seated. No reservations are taken for brunch at this location.   All of us enjoyed our food. I had the famous red velvet waffles with hash browns and mimosas. Delicious and I would go back for the breakfast casserole, biscuits and gravy or chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast this morning. My mom and I ordered the lemon poppyseed French toast and the breakfast casserole with cheese grits and split them. The lemon poppyseed French toast was amazing! I will definitely order it again! The breakfast casserole was very underwhelming- there was nothing special about it and it was quite bland. We both took a few bites of it and left the rest on our plate. The cheese grits tasted decent, but had a film over the top as if they sat out for a while. Our table was pushed against the dining room wall- and we noticed the wall could use a good cleaning as it was pretty dirty with splattered food/beverages that looked to have been there for quite some time. Overall, our experience was good, not great, and if it weren't for the delicious poppyseed French toast I'd probably give this establishment 3 stars."}
{"text":"In full disclosure I removed a star due to the fact that we ( a party of 6) waited an hour for a table at brunch when one was open at least a 1/2 hour before we were sat. I had to ask the hostess why we weren't being seated at the open table and was told they were waiting for a booth and the family wouldn't leave but then sat us at the open table. Unfortunately after you wait an hour you have higher expectations (as in, I waited an hour this better be Frikkin awesome)...and it wasn't. My choc chip pancakes were great but I wasn't a fan of the chicken apple sausage (it was burnt & didn't taste like breakfast sausage). Our friends weren't impressed with their eggs Benedict. I probably wouldn't go back for brunch as I hate waiting more than 20 minutes unless the food is spectacular and this wasn't."}
{"text":"The food  was ok but I'm not sure why they name their grits plantation grits , to me it's offensive ."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Amazing!! Her name was Vivian and she was beyond accommodating and suggested some great ideas for substitution that usually don't work! Would def recommend and hope you get her as a server..... Hash browns needed a little less butter."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how quickly we got seated on a Saturday morning. Service was great and the food didn't disappoint. Highly recommend the red velvet waffles. If you're in the mood for chicken and waffles, suggest you stick with the classic waffles. A little pricey but would definitely go back if we're back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Loved the red velvet waffle! It was super delicious and not too sweet. The green fried tomatoes were delicious - it had a good texture and tang flavor. I would skip on the chicken since it was dry and flavorless. The service was prompt and great. It cost about $25 with tip for the waffle and two sides of the tomato and chicken."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations of this place and I was totally bumped by such a loooooong wait. Hostesses didn't even try show that they care... We had to come over to them twice and ask about our wait and they told us that they called our name already, but they didn't, cause we were right there. I would totally recommend to reserve a table using open table app to avoid the frustration, cause the place is totally worth going to. I had Southern Sausage Benedict with hash browns and it was yummy. Spicy Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had. I also saw that they have a good coffee selection, which I would like to try. I will definitely give another chance to this place, so I can rate them with 5 stars:)"}
{"text":"This place is banging! While driving through Charlotte on my way to SC I Yelped it up and found this place for breakfast. I had the Shrimp & Grits and my wife had the Red Velvet Waffle. Both of them were amazing. I was a little concerned with the corporate feel of the area and the corporate feel and design of the restaurant, but after eating her I just don't care. Banging!"}
{"text":"The food choices I had were just ok (banana bread french toast and fried green tomatoes). Wouldn't get either again. The Sunshine cocktail was delish as well as the thick sliced bacon. Extremely packed on Sundays for brunch but the service and atmosphere was great. I'd definitely come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"FYI- This place does not have appropriate high chairs for children.  It's dangerous for small children and we had to leave.  See photos"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place my friends finally took me here and the food was delicious!   My first impression of this place was the de?or. The cafe has high ceilings and a upper level seating area. The ambiance is nice. As all brunch places if you're not there before 10:30-11am the wait time will be longer. We got there early and were seated immediately (side-note: you will not be seated unless your entire party is there).   We ordered coffee's and lattes to drink. The coffee was so smooth and my friend who is picky about her cream choices was given a specially made latte to her liking. Now thats great customer service.   For food:  - Red Velvet waffle (as a starter... don't you judge us!) - Kids 2 pancakes (with choice of meat) and side fruit and eggs - sausage egg and cheeses biscuit with side of hash browns - two quiche specials (chicken option) with side salads - side order (1/2) of the biscuit n gravy  everyone loved their food. My sausage egg and cheese biscuit was HUGE! It was perfectly soft on the inside. Their sausage is hand made at the location (amazinggg). Kinda spicy but i like the heat.  My friends loved their quiches. The portions here are quite large and the food is filling for sure.   the all-star of the experience however was their red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle and a huge strawberry on top. we spilt that as a group and man it was perfect!!!!!!!!!!   good food, good service, good location!"}
{"text":"Overall atmosphere is great for a casual brunch with friends on the weekends. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and the chicken was fried perfectly. Our waitress was also very attentive. However, multiple of my friends complained their food came out cold. It would have gotten a 5 stars if not for this fact."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Love the atmosphere. I ordered the full breakfast and it was so gooood!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Maryland we relied on Yelp to guide us in the right breakfast direction. We found Terrace Café and immediately walked into a warm ambient.   With pleasure we were served by Whitney and Amy. Wow. No words can describe the excellent customer service we received this morning. When we thought it couldn't have gotten any better... it did. Both were very attentive and made the entire experience absolutely memorable. Completely personable experience.   The food was impeccable. You can't go wrong with-- Strawberry French toast, Croissant: ham, egg, cheese, and Meat lovers Omelette. They are certainly not rating highly by accident.   Without a doubt we will visit this restaurant again. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmarks for the longest time.  Whenever it is expected for you to have a wait for brunch, seems like they have a good thing going here.  Overall I was pretty impressed with the place despite all the buildup and anticipation I had.  Our group of 5 was seated after about 45 min of waiting for a table (the hostess was actually dead on with the wait time which was pretty impressive).  The unfortunate thing about Terrace Cafe is that they do not take reservations, you can call ahead if your party is more than 6 people (we were almost tempted to grab someone off the street to eat brunch with us to save us on time, but that didn't happen).  After we were lead upstairs on the terrace level to a wide booth, our server got our drinks and went through the specials.  It took us a while to decide on food but when you want to try everything on the menu, it's a good problem to have.  You could tell that the servers here have to work their butts off due to the stairs (I'm assuming the kitchen is all below the terrace level seating).  I had the Southern Sausage Benedict... and I about had to change my pants once I cut into the perfectly poached egg and watched it soak into the muffin and sausage below it.  My plate was cleaned in about 10 minutes and I was full to the brim.  The other (slight) downside is that we were looking to get mimosas and get our drink on, but we forgot about NC laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol before noon on Sundays.  DOH!  A slight hitch in our plans, but we just rolled with it.  Next time we'll just meet \"later\" but it seems like the crowd doesn't really die down.  We were trying to beat the church crowd, but I think everyone else had that same idea as well."}
{"text":"I went to Terrace Cafe' today for the 1st time with several co-workers and can you say \"Outstanding\". The food was incredible and our server Kevin and the manager were \"Awesome\". I was so impressed that I will be back again for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"A local friend took me to brunch here over the weekend on a visit back to my old haunt, Charlotte. Terrace Cafe wasn't there when I moved away, so it was a nice change. We had a short 10 minute wait for a table upstairs.   It was crowded on this Sunday morning, and that was reflected in the very slow service. The food was good -- I had the steak and eggs with coffee.  The steak was delicious; the coffee too strong. My friend had another breakfast which she said was good.    I'll definitely eat here again on another trip to Charlotte, but will hope for better service."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Sunday and enjoyed the food! It's on the higher end in price but the food is wonderful. Everything on our plates was delicious! I had the red velvet waffle and chicken.  It didn't taste like a redvelvet but the icing and strawberry made it very good that it's one of the best waffles I've tasted. The wait is long because of its popularity so that says alot about their food."}
{"text":"The best! I first went here after all the tag reviews and I have not been to a lot of place in which their pancakes rival IHOP but this place did it ! Everything was amazing!!!! The restaurant is found in the heart of Southpark not far from Southpark mall. The restaurant has multiple floors which is great for parties. The waist staff is attentive, knows the menu very well, and kept the drinks flowing. Although I do wish they had mimosa specials the food comes hot and fast which makes up for it."}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Terrace Cafe offers some of the best breakfast around. Grant it i always get the same thing when i come here which is the red velvet waffle and chicken with a side of grits. Everything is indescribably good! I brought my father and daughter here my dad had never been here before and he scraped his plate pass cleaned. So i take it he likes it as much as i do.Saturdays are always one big party here, i have never came here on a Saturday and didn't have to wait. You will have at least a 30 minute wait on Saturdays guaranteed. On the weekends they don't allow reservations because of this reason they are very aware that Saturday is pretty much one of their most bustiest days. I salute the breakfast, team, and staff here at terrace cafe this will always be a breakfast home for me."}
