{"text":"This place is a gem in the east! I live in Scarborough and travel here just for the sushi.

The atmosphere is so cute with individual little huts for privacy and intimacy. Their sushi tastes so fresh - the shrimp tempura sushi, crab tempura sushi, avacado and cucumber sushi are my favourite. Their tempura is delish and the waiters are always there to help. The sushi is made fresh when you order and the all you can eat is always the way to go. 

I always take friends who want to try sushi to this place and it has seriously ruined any other sushi place for me. If you ever come across this place and have some time on your hands, I definitely suggest stopping in and indulging for me!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan, but i love this place. The people are SO nice, friendly, kind and thoughtful. They make sure you always have a great time and are quite funny. We have had the all you can eat many times (18.99- Dinner). I don't eat fish, so i can't say about that, but the vegetarian rolls (yam/sweet potato) and deep fried dumplings are SO GOOD! 

They also have private boots, which is always such a great time."}
{"text":"I came here because of  the high praise people were giving it on yelp. Sadly, I'm  starting to wonder if people  writing on this page know the difference  between  good quality sushi and bad. To be blunt, it is not good sushi. We came for dinner which was $18.99. The sushi we got was falling apart even before we had even touched it. The fish was not fresh and our Kalbi  (beef ribs) looked like it was cooked on low heat with day old oil. I don't mean to sound like a sushi snob but i don't want others  to come here duped like me. The restaurant was served by sweet older Asians so i feel a bit bad about writing this review. However, they need to improve the quality of their sushi in order to keep their customers. 

My favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Whitby is Tatemono near Brock and Consumers road. It's about  $26 for dinner but at least I know  I'll enjoy my dining  experience. For those looking for a good place to eat sushi in Whitby, i hope this helps."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food was fresh. Great atmosphere with private booths. More selection would have been nice. Price was decent too."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend there knowing it was just a little hole in the wall, I kind of liked that it was smaller and quiet place but the rolls sucked. They all fell apart when we tried to pick them up. Half of them didn't even have the fish in them. Also could have more options on the all of can eat menu. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Driving by this small sushi \"house\" next to a minimart, you may never notice it...but you shouldn't. This is a quaint little place, fairly busy in a meat and potatoes town where AA chuck is considered \"fancy.\"Kyoto is known for it's All-You-Can't lunch price of only 12 bucks (I opted for it, plus tax and tip left $15). The fish is fresh mar the red snapper which smells understandably fishy considering it's not popular. The salmon rolls and nigiri were quite fresh and the sesame seeds gave it a nice flavor. The Miso was inedible and 90% Soy, at least (which was also available in a little tea pot, like I need that -_-). I would describe the soup's flavor as a mix between rhino feces and eye crust. As always the wasabi and pickled ginger was so strong and spicy I only tried them once. The crab rolls (imitation, not that hard to tell) were slightly chewing and the sesame over bared it's weak flavor. The best item was by far the shrimp tepura roll, crispy, light, and moist. Overall the food was hit and miss, but for the price:good. Next time I may opt for the uni or roe, now that they've proved their stuff on the lower end. The chef is good (formation, seasoning, glaze) but no Masa and has a way to go before he could make it in NYC or LA. I had two servers one was friendly the other grumpy, and even though the food's not very good, the value for money is unbeatable, literaly I have not been to a restaurant in Canada where you can get this much food for this little price, literally. If you have a big appetite you could probably eat more than $12 of food (I know food prices on a wholesale level, there profit margin on the average customer is 2.5x cost, if you haven't had breakfast or lunch like me you could work it down to 1.5 or 1 and literally just pay for the food, if you're a competitive eat you literally make it so \"they pay you to eat\" by reducing margins so much\" Although this runon paragraph is full of runon sentences but I had to do this fast, this place deserves a review especially when there's bullshit places like Affy's premium grill or Bamiyan out there."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown (Toronto) location multiple times when I was in uni. The server is really friendly compared to the other location. Food is good and it will fill you up. Service may be a bit slow since it's not too busy (usually lunch). I don't have any problems with the food. Don't expect high quality. However, it is really worth it for the price that you pay. 

** Could have more options for lunch menu, but then again it's not as expensive compared to other AYCE places

Lunch - $12.99
Dinner - $19.99 (I think applied Monday - Friday)"}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious. Love this place, family run and we always know it's going to be so good. Excellent service and food and a great price."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous and dirty, they process grocery store fish as sushi without blast freezing so lots of brown worms in your food!
It is ran by two shady chinese couple , the waitress with glasses that begs for tips and the dirty looking skinny guy making the food.
Whitby health should shut their doors, they are insane and dangerous!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!

Fastest service, kindest servers. Freshest sushi, not the best rolled. Cheap & always delicious. The servers explain the food when it comes out so your'e not just left looking at a plate like \" wait... what is this? did we order this...?\" Such a wide variety on the AYCE options as well.

Favorite spot for quick sushi and cute decor!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great Service! 

Better than average food and exceptional service. If you're a sushi connoisseur it will slightly miss your high standards. However for a great AYCE lunch/dinner this place is perfect. The prices are unbeatable and the sushi is good. Our favourites were the spicy crab, salmon sushi and avocado pizza. The price is unbeatable and the staff is exceptionally friendly. Definitely would check it out if you love AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"The waitress is so nice and friendly but for food is horrible. The service is slow. We've waited for twenty minutes for the first plates and it's not even busy only another one table next to us. The sashimi isn't fresh at all also has very few items. My Bf got stomachache after having couple rolls. If you look for fresh sushi place, it's not the place to come to enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty skeptical of AYCE sushi - but Kyoto House impressed me for lunch. Lots on the menu, and good stuff too - definitely better fish than you'll find in a lot of AYCEs."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are lovely and attentive. The place is small but cosy. Get a booth. The all you can eat is packed with great fresh food and the value is unbeatable."}
{"text":"If you are used to Japanese Sushi. This is not it. This is white person sushi. 

The restaurant its self is very nice. And the booths are very private which is cool. The tempura is delicious and shrimp tempura was huge. 

After that it goes downhill and fast. The sushi was ready way way to fast to be fresh. We were in at 5:30 and had food at 5:35... The presentation was non existent. Just rice and seaweed on a plate and the rolls were lacking rice and falling apart. 

The sashimi was grainy because of the way it was cut. The soy sauce is sweet... Like they used tempura sauce to make a bottle go further. 

Very unfortunate as it is so close to home and a really good price. But it goes to show you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Kyoto House is located on Brock Street in Whitby, about three streets north of Dundas in a small plaza. If you weren't looking for it, it would be easy to pass by, especially since there's construction in the area.

I came here upon a recommendation from a friend of a friend. I'm always down for trying out new sushi places, so we came here on a Monday night. This restaurant is fairly small but nice enough. The all you can eat is about $18.99 for dinner (I think its around $11.99 for lunch). I ended up ordering a green salad, a few salmon sashimi and one tuna (or something...), we got an order of spicy crunchy tuna rolls, a dragon roll, and teriyaki chicken.

My green salad came first and it was not what I was expecting. At almost all the other japanese restaurants I've been to, the green salad has this tasty yummy orange dressing. This one had some weird mayonnaise based dressing. Halfway through the salad I had to push it away because it was such a gross taste. My sashimi came next and it was okay. Definitely not the same grade of sashimi as I've found at other sushi places, but still good. The soy sauce though, seemed to be watered down. Quite a lot in fact.

The spicy crunchy tuna rolls were quite good (although falling apart), but the dragon roll fell a little flat for me. It was too big of a roll (almost falling apart when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks) and hard to fit in my mouth in one bite. The teriyaki chicken was quite good as well. We also got two pieces of the roll of the day, a hawaii roll, which was okay but nothing to write home about.

My main reason for giving this place a fairly low rating is due to the sloppy rolls. In a sushi restaurant the rolls should be well done but every single roll we got was falling apart as I ate it. If I can't pick up the roll and tip it in soy sauce and get it to my mouth in one piece, we have a problem. I could barely fit the dragon roll in my mouth and nothing really stood out as great.

Overall, this was a mediocre dining experience for me and I won't be back. Nothing was good enough to bring me back for a second time, and while the service was great (two pieces of free roll, an orange for my friend's baby and a toy for her to play with) it just didn't cut it. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews here, you can get better sushi if you're willing to travel for it."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. It has a salad that is unique to this location, so be prepared when ordering. 
The people here have been serving my family for years so I'm a bit biased. 
The food is great and the quantities are generous, whether you like raw sushi or the cooked items on the menu.
Kyoto sometumes struggles with large parties. Not so much with service but more with who ordered what. If you have a large group it's better to just have them put the food in the middle and sort it out yourself."}
{"text":"This all you can eat place is cozy and warm. My go to after work. I won't even go to an all you can eat place downtown or Scarborough even though I work downtown. I always end up at Kyoto because they are friendly and the booths are comfy. As well, the orders come quick so your appetite doesn' waiver for a long wait between orders.  They don't have the fancy iPads but the orders are accurate."}
{"text":"I used to love love love this restaurant. It was my go-to sushi place, delicious, friendly service. The decor was awesome, I loved their booths and how private they were. They practically knew us on a first name basis. When I got pregnant and I couldn't eat sushi, I still came with my boyfriend and ate tempura and vegetarian sushi. Shortly after my daughter was born (06/14)  their service began to change.. They were still as friendly as ever but the food itself was getting lower and lower on the scale. They would have either over cooked or under cooked tempura, or sometimes it tasted like they hadn't changed the oil in their fryer in months. Sashimi portions used to be average sized, sometimes they would be huge but now they're small, paper thin and limp. Their meat would be over cooked and their sushi rolls were very small. I haven't been back in a couple months, because I found another place with average portions and delicious tempura. I really want to like this place, but the little things added up and I just can't go back."}
