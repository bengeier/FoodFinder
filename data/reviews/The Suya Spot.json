{"text":"On our very first visit to Canada, my fiancee and I found this place through a Google search. It was a nice spot, enjoyed the ambiance, they had some Naija jams playing. We walked up to the counter and the cashier/hostess/server looked at us like we were disturbing her peace. After about 30 awkward seconds she finally greets and my fiancee asks for a menu. I kid you not, she FLINGS the menu at my fiancee and then walks away.... I thought Canadians were nice lol. She comes back out, and seems to have taken her bipolar meds and greeted us again and asked if we ordered... BISH WHEN??!!! (I really wish I was making up this story)   WELL, we ordered beef suya, and waited for about 20 minutes before it came out. At first glance it looked pretty good. I had a few pieces with onion, and it was bad (overcooked and dry) ... To make matters worse, I looked to the side of the plate and saw what seemed to be \"suya pepper\"... WRONG!!! It was actually dried red pepper (atta gungun) used for cooking (you guys should YouTube/Google \"How to make suya pepper\"). My fiancee then noticed an odor coming from a few strips of suya meat.... guess what? That joint was spoiled too... WHAT THE TOTAL FAAAQQQ!!!! We stood up, smiled and walked out minus the attempted food poisoning... thank you Suya Spot, you played yourself... hold this \"L\" real quick.   For my visiting 9ja peeps, skip this spot. If you you're tryna throw up and shit all-night, order the beef suya with ground red pepper.....  P.S. - Tell the cashier/hostess/server to be a tad bit friendly. The 1 star is a gift,  if I were able to give 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Came here after reading the hype about it on the local newspaper. The restaurant has a very unassuming presence in a strip mall on Weston Rd. The sign didn't stand out in the dark but that didn't affect me at all. Coming into the restaurant, I saw the owner and a few employees chatting heartily with customers in a classy decor. All look good.  The menu is really limited. There are 4 or 5 dishes on offer, all of them suya (of beef, chicken, goat) and a plaintain. Suyas are proced $10 for small and $20 for large. I ordered a beef + chicken large suya to go. Service was super friendly.  The beef suya was very dry and felt like beef jerky at times. A good portion of the beef is charred (I don't know if this is the restaurant's mistake or that's how suya supposed to be). It's hard, definitely not tender meat. Same goes for the chicken, only a bit more tender (still chewy). I could barely get any juice out of the meats. The only side vegetable was raw onion, which further emphasize the spiciness of the dish. I liked the idea, if only the meat was better."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 because the customer service is sub-par, the music/tv is usually too loud and they have a very minimal selection, essentially with only suya on their menu. A 3 (and I'm being nice) because they are one of the only few suya (peanut bbq meat) suppliers in town, and they usually sell a variety - beef, chicken, goat, assorted."}
{"text":"The meat is always dry and one thing I don't understand is the pepper they use to go with the meat... it is dry AF too! unless the meat is hot and juicy,  the pepper should be a bit wet in order to offset the dryness of the meat. it  does not make sense if they are both dry! its even worse  when they cater at events! The meat gets cold and dry  from  sitting all night long...plus they don't use an actual charcoal grill like they do back in Africa so its not very authentic.. Overall, its just okay.."}
{"text":"SUYA SUYA .  this shit is good lmao i cant say no more . U may as well just go try it for yoself !!"}
{"text":"They weren't expecting people to come in for a late lunch, were they? We came and I wanted Nigerian food. They had suya, the grilled meats, but they didn't have jollof rice or plantains. That chef would come in the evening. Um...okay. So suya and poutine it is. Strange combo. They also had moi moi, a bean and dried fish pudding, which was rather tasty.   The small suya comes in what kinda looks like a styrofoam hot dog box, if that helps with portion sizing. It's basically just meat with a few onion pieces and a small container of very spicy hot sauce. The beef suya was very dry. The goat was hit and miss. My friends all got bone-in goat and said theirs wasn't dry. Mine was all boneless. The assorted internal organs were interesting. The tripe was my favorite, but I'm not a fan of most other organs, unless it's intestine, and I don't think they had it.   They have three sizes of poutine. The small is the small square styrofoam box. The medium is your standard rectangular styrofoam box. The large is your large square styrofoam box. Small poutines start at $6.50 and Larges start at $9.00. They also have \"gourmet\" poutines that include mozz, cheese curds, gravy, and bbq chicken, bbq jerk chicken, or spicy chicken. You can also upgrade to beef suya if you don't want chicken. We got the large gourmet poutine with bbq chicken for $11.00. The portion was good. I'd actually rather have it without the chicken, but for people who enjoy what I'm assuming Subway's bbq chicken would taste like, this is for you. The cheese curds are very big. They're chunks. I don't now how else to put it. Totally worth it though.   I guess what I'm trying to say is I'd come back for the poutine, but not necessarily for the Nigerian food."}
{"text":"This place had a nice selection of music. The DJ was amazing and the lounge was a nice location. The only issue I had with this place was the bar tender. She was very rude and aggressive. She would get the orders wrong and verbally abuse the patrons. This place would receive better ratings if they had a more pleasant and less aggressive bar tender."}
