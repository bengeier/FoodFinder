{"text":"Despite living very close by, I've just eaten here for the first time. I was there for dinner with a group of 6. Luckily we had made a reservation as it was quite busy.  I had the special which was a pork chop stuffed with asiago cheese, with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans and cheesecake for dessert. Oh.... and a bottle of the house red. It was all delicious!   The service was great, we took forever to order, changed what we ordered and the server was very accommodating.  The decor is quite neutral, overall a casual feeling to the place."}
{"text":"Last night we had a wonderful dinner at Melanie's.  We each had the 3 course dinner special for $34, which allows you to order anything on the menu except the steak and is a great value.  Every course was delicious.  For appetizers the three of us had the watermelon and arugula salad, tomato and goat cheese salad and lentil soup.  The salad dressing was especially memorable.  For the main, all of us opted for the stuffed bacon wrapped chicken breast and found it to be juicy with a great blend of flavours.  Even the mashed potatoes that came with were outstanding.  We also all enjoyed the desserts we ordered, chocolate mousse cake, creme brûlée and chocolate Sundae.  Some people have said the service was too slow, but I found it to be nicely paced.  When having a big dinner I like to have a few minutes to digest between courses.  The waitress was attentive, filling our water-glasses frequently and checking that we were happy with each course.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers!!! The homemade patties are generous, and have the perfect fat content. Top it off with crisp bacon and cheese, accompanied by some of the best home fries I've had in a while, and you have the makings of a great brunch.  Service could be friendlier but otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"Our First time there was for brunch. Both plates we had were fantastic. A little on the higher prices side ($15 a dish) but the quality is there. The place it's pretty simple in a nice way. We would defiantly go back again."}
{"text":"Wow! At firs glance I thought \"there's nothing special about this place\". Small, family owned, charming, meh. Yet as the meal progressed I was more and more impressed. The dishes were well composed and excellently done, my croque Madame was delicious! Service was charmingly simple and straight forward. Brunch was a huge success and we look forward to coming for dinner some time."}
{"text":"All very average. Been three times now, last two times were very average, leaving at three stars based on decent first visit."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner here with my office staff. The prix fixe is definitely worth it. You get appetizer, main course and dessert for $31/pp. The food was delicious and very large portions.  We will be back. Thank you Melanie and team."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's cozy, and the food is delicious. Melanie is very friendly and personally makes sure her guests are happy.  Love it here and will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Probably being slightly generous with a 4. I took in lunch and Brunch in at this place. Service was very good but may be slow for some. I took in the vegetarian omelette with a side of fruit, potatoes, and some tasty toast. Definately tasty. This is my 4th time to the restaurant. Haven't been in awhile but always find the food fresh, tasty, and definately not greasy. I noted a large contingent of families taking in this Brunch spot which is within walking distance of my place and hence conveniently located. I do note that it is definately pricey. Brunches are priced at around 12-13 dollars."}
{"text":"The menu and thoughtful wine selection feel upscale but everything is reasonably priced and it's a pretty relaxed atmosphere.  Have tried just about everything. Great food.  Melanie and the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome.   Seems to be a neighbourhood favourite with lots of regulars."}
{"text":"First visit to Melanie's Bistro. I was very impressed with the food and friendly staff. I had the traditional breakfast, added a third egg, and chose bacon. It was done perfectly.  Over easy eggs were perfect, and their bacon was thin and crispy without being burnt or crusty. The potatoes reminded me of the way my grandmother used to make them, so that was a fun memory recall for me. And the salad had slivers of apple which added an extra freshness to an already tasty side. Coffee was good too. The only complaint I have was that their service on the Sunday Brunch time was a bit slow. Overall very happy with this experience. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Since Melanie has moved into the neighbourhood, I have been a regular client. The atmoshere is welcoming, Melanie herself is a warm spirit and her staff are knowledgeable and always aim to please. Anything from the menu is magnificent - \"bangers a must\" and each night you visit, you will be delighted with a new creative special. Okay now the desserts..Pecan carmel cheescake....MMMMM and the Creme Brule is mouth watering. Can't say enough...go and try and then go again and again!!!"}
{"text":"My family have been going to Melanie's since it opened and we're very happy it's stayed open. The food is always excellent and we've never been disappointed. It's our go-to place for special family occasions and Mother's Day brunch. Melanie, the owner/host is so friendly and welcoming, she always stops by to chat and catch up. My children love the sweet potato fries and the dressing on the side, is very tasty. The pastas and meat entrees are always fresh  and delicious and the presentation is always wonderful. My daughter and I always order the crème brulee, it's absolutely wonderful as are all of their desserts."}
{"text":"If your looking for a nice little cafe/bistro that's laid back, with great food at a great price this is the place. The food is simple and really good, with just the right size menu - they know what they're doing.   Every time we go, the tenure staff is always friendly, attentive and relaxed. We've been probably 5-10 times in the past year and sampled most of the menu. Their burger is phenomenal and their brunch French Toast is amazing! Its great for couples and family's. The environment is kind of minimal and trendy but also welcoming.  The owner is always walking around, helping the wait staff and walking with the guests."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a birthday dinner and have been many times in the past.  Melanie's is always so cozy.  Wait staff is very friendly and Melanie herself always stops by for a chat.  Food and desserts are great.  They do a prix-fixe menu nightly.  They also do a kids pasta that isn't on the menu.  A bit pricey but well worth it for a special evening."}
{"text":"This bistro is a nice spot on the Danforth.  Portions are small and pricey but taste good!  There are other spots that I would choose before this if I was alone, but it is a nice spot to take a guest."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Food was not great, portion was very small for how much they charged. Service was good.  They seem to have a lot of customers, guess just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Food is just wonderful here. Service however isn't quite the same caliber. Waitresses were not very attentive and slow to react."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The staff is very friendly and the food .... I will honestly say I rarely finish my meal , and this is one of the very few places I want to lick the plate.  Food is always fresh , they even put caviar on your breakfast eggs ??  The freshly squeezed OJ mimosas are delicious.   I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We have been there on numerous occassions since it's close to home.  It was busy for brunch at noon and it's always feels good that the local family business is making it.  The owner Melanie was present as always to over see the quality & service.  Her husband is the chef.  Our order:  Newfoundland Eggs Bene, **two perfectly cooked poached eggs sitting a top Cod Fish Cakes in lieu of english muffins with very lemony hollaindaise.  fresh berries and fried potatoes.  the fish cakes don't have enough fish taste on them (some people may like that) .  I would recommend this dish to anyone.  Very satisfying.  Bistro Burger with soup of the day (Potato Leek) **the burger was  too salty and the garlic was  overwhelming but the soup was piping hot and would have a big bowl anytime.  One thing about Melanie's that is a bit depressing is the decor.  It's not  hip or modern it's upscale cafeteria.   Although it was busy the ambiance was lacking.  That's not going to keep us away but it's worth noting.  The service  is excellent!!!     Total:  $35.03 PLUS TIP...  **on a side note brunch cost my husband actually $600 since I had to visit the brand new Jeweller next door!!  Jewellery For You...Lucio the owner opened in November and has some really unique pieces.."}
{"text":"Melanie's has a simple, delicious menu.  The service is consistently on target.   The daily soup specials are interesting and perfectly crafted.  The garden salad changes slightly from day to day to reflect available veggies...also delicious.  And always fresh. We have been here several times for lunch or brunch and everything hits the spot.   We will be back for dinner.   \"Melanie\" (or the owner) is gracious, professional and always checks in with patrons to ensure they are satisfied.    Our go to favourite lunch is the curry chicken wrap ... One of my favourite lunches anywhere in the city.    The restaurant is comfortable and casual and if the venue had a more unique character this would be a five star review all the way.    One of the best on the danforth for sure.   So shortly after posting this review, we went here for dinner.   OMG    Dinner is ten times as good as lunch.   The food is fresh and delicious and the plates are perfectly paired.  Flawlessly presented.  And clearly prepared with great skill.   I had the shrimp linguine - an instant new favourite for me.  My wife had the salmon.   Both of us raved about our experience.  I truly would have licked the plate if I were alone.     Unbelievably good food.  Friendly.  Simple.   Honest.   Tasty.  And dessert??? Prepared in house.   Off the charts.     Decor still needs an overhaul.   A 10k face lift would totally change the experience.   But I'm upping my rating to five stars despite this.   The food and service are just that good."}
{"text":"We are so very happy to have Melanie's Bistro in the neighbourhood. The food is always delicious, creative and great presentation. My family are regular patrons we love the atmosphere, the food and the very friendly and attentive service and have been coming to Melanie's Bistro since it opened. Melanie, who owns the bistro along with her chef husband, are very friendly and creative. They are committed to improving the business landscape in the neighbourhood, which is great. We highly recommend Melanie's Bistro to all our friends and family and we always celebrate Mother's Day with their amazing brunch."}
{"text":"We had been here once before for Sunday dinner... a nice meal and had the pleasure of meeting the owner. Yesterday, however was a completely different story. We sat on the front patio for brunch. It took about 8 minutes to be greeted... by that time we already knew what we were going to order as I had looked up the brunch menu on my phone (as we had no menus). When the server came to our table, we said we both like the French toast, coffee, and water. Coffee came about 5 minutes later. Had to remind her about the water and place settings. Water came, silverware, but no spoon for the coffee. Food was delivered (yummy) hot and fresh. Not once did we get a coffee or water refill. We sat there with empty glasses and mugs. We were totally abandoned at the table. I went in to inform that I'd like to pay. Server asked how everything was, I said food was delicious but the service was horrible. She apologized, said she was new, proceeded to print the cheque without any sort of compensation for the lack of attention. I left her a loonie for a tip and we got out of there."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write this as I don't want the word to spread too much.  I like to think of this place as my little brunch secret.  While I haven't made it for dinner the brunch is fantastic!! I've tried a couple of the items and would rank each one five stars.  A little off the beaten path but certainly worth the trip."}
{"text":"Always a nice dining experience. The service and food are great and it's right in my hood."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. It's unassuming and quaint, if not a little on the pricier side.   I ordered the bacon wrapped chicken breast, which comes with mashed potatoes, but you have to order a side of vegetables - I really think 5 dollars for a few pieces of asparagus is a bit over the top, so they should rethink their policy on that front, and just include the vegetable. Seriously I'm a bit ticked off at this fact.  My dinner companion had the cod fish, which was decent, but nowhere near as good as the chicken. I think it was a bit too mooshy for my tastes.   Our server was friendly and continuously made sure we had all that we needed.   It feels like a small town restaurant, which reminds me of home. Honestly, the food is good and I'd go back more often if it weren't for the prohibitive  prices."}
{"text":"Herb hollandaise, in a word: wow.  I've been to Melanie's for dinner twice and really wasn't that impressed, but I did hear that their brunch was pretty killer, so I decided to give it a whirl and was thoroughly impressed.  To me, the clear winner on the menu was the Newfoundland breakfast special: pan fried cod cakes poached eggs, finished with herb hollandaise, fresh fruit, country fries and toast.  Though it looks small, and carries a heavier price tag than I was anticipating ($13), it was worth every penny and a maybe even a few extra nickels. The eggs were perfectly soft-poached (a lost art), the cod cakes incredibly smooth and flavourful and the herb hollandaise was worth the order alone.  Friendly service, a skilled kitchen and a cold pint. That's a winner in my books."}
{"text":"we have been there a couple of times, the food has been always tasty. the menu sometimes offers twists more than changes. it is on the expensive side ($15 for eggs Benny). the service has been on the minus side since Melanie established. the same waiters always seem panicking and not always sure of what to do or ask. it could be even better aligned with the pricing if service was better."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but it's just not happening. Our brunch today was really underwhelming. Nothing terrible about it, but lacking passion. It was not worth the price nor the surprisingly long wait.  This would be excellent food if it was being served by a hospital."}
{"text":"Breastfeeding babies and mommies are not welcome here. The manager was so kind that she said she'd be able to move a chair to the washroom if my wife wanted to feed the baby. You don't eat in the washroom; why should a baby eat in one? Will never be going back"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and very reasonable, super quiet on a Friday evening - very surprising. Short walk from Woodbine subway. Highly recommended BYOW 6 days a week and free corkage Wednesday- fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, there were a few other tables, several of which were regulars who knew the owner by name. Service was courteous, attentive. They were offering a special burger with peameal bacon, a fried egg and caramelized onions. It was so good. The patty was a fair size, the meat seemed to be of good quality. It was rather messy but definitely worth it. The coffee wad rather decent too."}
{"text":"Mother's day brunch was fabulous.  Kids loved the french toast and waffles.  Crab omelette was with real crab and tested wonderful."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this breakfast slash brunch spot. Well crafted food with a very satisfying taste. Coffer was perfectly brewed - fresh. We had the pecan French toast - crunchy and sweet. So good! Also had the newfoundland benny with cod cakes. Excellent as well. This is a fabulous little spot on the Danforth."}
{"text":"The was my first time here and it was an average experience. I got the huevos rancheros and it was delicious, just very small portions! After I was done eating I was still a bit hungry. My hubby got the Belgian waffles which surely did not full him what so ever.  Food presentation was beautiful! I gave 3 stars because of the long wait to be seated and the amount of time it took for our food to arrive which was a half hour wait. Staff were average but nice when you spoke to them. You could tell they were busy. I'd probably come back in the future at a less busy time when I'm not starving."}
{"text":"A first-time visitor I thought that the Newfoundland eggs benedict sounded wonderful.  I had to leave in 55 minutes for an appointment and told the waitress.  She said that the order would take 20-25 minutes.  Fine.  After waiting 30 minutes the table behind me was complaining about the long wait for their meal and that if it didn't come immediately, they would have to leave.  Their waitress apologized sincerely and their meal came a few minutes later.  Better late than never.  After waiting 40 minutes, still no sign of my order.  Even if the meal came that second I would have to down it, pay the bill and get to my appointment, all in 15 minutes.  I complained and was told \"There are no guarantees here.\"  Clearly there was a problem in the kitchen, but one table gets a genuine apology and, for the same complaint, I get grief.  Really terrible.  I asked for the bill ($11 for one beer on tap and one tiny orange juice).  This meal should have taken 15 minutes to prepare--20 max.  Double that time and still nothing.  A really disappointing experience.  I wouldn't recommend Melanie's to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was standard, our server seemed pleasant and attentive. We were seated at 10:10am and settled the bill at 11:00. I had had just been brought a $14 drink 5 minutes before that. A few minutes after paying our server approached the table and said, \"sorry, I hate to do this but we need the table, I'd love to let you sit here and chat all day but it's getting busy\". There was a party of three waiting but that was the extent of how busy it was. Hands down one of the worst customer services I've ever had especially considering the prices and bland food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch a few times. They make Good but strong coffee. I had the crab cake Benny once here and the other times I had the newfie breakfast... The Newfie breakfast is one of my all time favourite meals. I have to say that the kitchen can be very slow at Times. We waited for over 30 minutes for our meal today so don't go there if you're in a rush to get out."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic New Year's Eve dinner once again. Consistently great good and service."}
{"text":"A local favourite in the east end! Service is great. The staff listens to dietary restrictions and if something isn't to satisfaction, they will remake it. One of dishes were really spicy and the staff remade it for us.  They currently have a special where you can choose an appetizer (anything except the crab cakes, shrimps, or sweet potato fries), a main (anything except for the steak), and a dessert for $28. If you want the crab cakes or sweet potato fries, they are willing to give it as a side (smaller portion- one crab cake vs three etc.). There's another option where you can pick the steak and either one appetizer or dessert for $32. We all opted for the $28 meal cause it's a good deal. Even if you get a la carte, the deal is cheaper! Well as long as you don't want three crab cakes ;)   The food was delicious. Is a fusion of Canadian, Italian (kind of),  and asian. I had beet salad, cod, and mixed berries cake. Sooo yummy. Others had salmon and noodles, pasta, spicy lamb meatball, spiced game meat ragu, and chocolate cake. Overall, the food was tasty and cooked pretty well. Presentation was ok as well. The menu isn't extensive, but it had something for everyone."}
{"text":"NStopped in to this neighbourhood restaurant as I was strolling the Danforth one Friday afternoon.  The lunch special of a cheeseburger,  salad or soup du jour along with 1/2 pint of Mill Street beer for $10.00 seemed too good to be true.  Sat on the patio and ordered.   Water and beer  were promptly served and after a bit of a wait an apology was given for the length of time my order was taking to arrive.  Apparently  the kitchen was working on a very large take - out order.  Since I was not on a hurry and the sunshine was so lovely I did not mind.  Also, the apology and explanation went a long way with very thoughtful customer service instead of being left waiting and wondering where my food was. I also ordered fries on the side for an extra $4.00. Food arrives and looks amazing and delicious.   Thick juicy patty with lovely melted cheddar.  Salad on the side had a very tasty dressing which seemed to be balsamic, olive oil and mustard seed.  The fries although seemed to me a small amount for the price were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just the way I like them. The burger had a very tasty flavor and was very juicy. The deal is a great one and would most certainly go back.  Love to see the owner and chef come out to say hello and ask me how everything was."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Great local spot and it's owned by a husband and wife pair (chef & pastry chef!). I've been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner and each time I was not disappointed. Most recently I had the mixed mushroom tart and it is mushroomy, garlicky, creamy heaven. Perfect for an appetizer but they seriously need to consider making it bigger to be a main it's that good.  I understand all the below reviews 'service is a little slow' but sorry fellow reviewers you all need to relax. This is a dine-in experience not fast food, quality over speed should always win out. Also, this is a small local spot they simply don't employ double the amount of wait staff just so they can shave a few minutes on your food delivery - again, it's a small local spot not the keg, relax enjoy a night out!  4 stars and not 5 because some items although very tasty are a little pricey for what you get. Along with my mushroom tart (yum) I had the Strozzapreti pasta (spicy pasta with lamb meatballs) the dish was a good portion packed with great flavour but the lamb meatballs were really small (like mini mini meatballs) and there were only a few which was kind of a bummer.  Finally, the Carrot cake. Get it."}
{"text":"Melanie's Bistro is wonderful. Almost perfect. Sometimes when the gastro planets align (as in a beautiful Saturday at the start of a long weekend, a table open on a very small patio that seats only 4 people, a perfect double shot latte with honey, great food and great service), you get to write a 5 star review.   Why is Melanie's so good? This is why.   1) You can sit where you want to sit 2) The environment is definitely \"bistro\" with a warm charm and the hustle of a small kitchen making fresh food.  3) You ask for honey for your latte and they bring you some in a small metal cup and not packets of Kraft honey or a leaky bottle. 4) The accompanying mescaline greens that come with the smoked salmon eggs Benny are almost better than the Benny.  5) The perfect portion of eggs Benny to greens and fruit 6) Prompt and friendly service from the hostess to waitress to the food runner.  7) You ask for a menu after you start eating just to see what else they have.  8) A perfectly crafted brunch menu with eggs, burgers, fruit and salads. Small but perfect.  9) The rest rooms are CLEAN! 10) The prices are very reasonable!  The eggs on the smoked salmon benny were absolutely perfect and looked like they just arrived from the farm. One of THE best smoked salmon eggs benny EVER!  So my review is perfect but why do I describe it as almost perfect? Because the gastro planets don't always align and I will have to go back again just to see if the same experience holds true. And I look forward to doing that!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps on giving. My wife and I went for her early-birthday dinner, and we were pretty much blown away. We both had specials - her, a steak smothered in blue cheese and sauteed mushrooms, me, a seafood curry stew. Both meals were delicious and done to perfection. We were also extremely impressed with the desserts we ordered (a creme brulee and a toffee-chocolate cheesecake), which I am to understand are made by Melanie herself. (It's also really nice to talk with Melanie, who makes a point of talking to all of her customers while they're at the restaurant.)  Overall, a great meal and great experience, which is making us sad we don't come here more often than we do."}
{"text":"A modest and spacious place for a delicious dinner. Brought a couple of special bottles of wine for three diners and confirmed they indeed had free corkage on Wednesdays. Was greeted and served by a charming lady. The poutine and duck pate appetizers were delicious. Also the steak, cod, and lamb main courses were well prepared and presented.   Blues music played in the background of which I'm a fan.   They let me bring my own larger wine glasses and offered to rinse them afterwards.   For a mid week BYOB (bring your own bottle) wine dinner I recommend Melanie's Bistro. And there really IS a Melanie"}
{"text":"Nice and small setting. Spend some cozy time. Food is 5 STAR similar to the one you get from hotel restaurant. Highly recommended. Will come again."}
{"text":"While driving down the Danforth we saw this restaurant and decided to give it a try after reading some glowing reviews. The raving reviews were correct this place was a really great experience. The atmosphere is very cozy, the food delicious and service great. We had the goat cheese salad to start and it was fantastic. You really can't go wrong with crispy goat cheese! Then we shared the butter chicken which was recommended and it too was delicious.  If you're on the Danforth stop by this great little place."}
{"text":"Earlier today my parents were in Toronto and I thought I'd treat them to this very rare \"needle in a haystack\" restaurant. Having lived along the danforth, and in the general area for over 3 years, I can say undoubtedly that this place is a rare find for its location. Its location is a slight contrast to that of Greek Town (west end of Danforth), where you would expect to find this place.   Located less than a 10 min walk from Woodbine subway station, Melanie's Bistro sits among some interesting but not unappealing eclectic stores. There's a barber shop, coffee shop, ice cream shop, a few mechanic shops, and various other stores close by.  Melanie's Bistro has some of the best food I've tasted in quite some time from an independent business owner. Food is presented in modern style, on nice plates, trays and bowls. Napkins encompass the cutlery in a classy style. Although the food portions are smaller than elsewhere, the taste is quite exceptional. Staff cooked my meal tonight to my dietary needs (I'm allergic to Tomatoes), and I really appreciate how they handled my request and needs. The staff, particularly the owner 'Melanie' is quite friendly, professional, kind and attentive. Price wise it leans only very slightly towards the more expensive side, relative to portion size, which I think is its only downfall. The front patio is quite small and seems to be only able to seat 8.  This place is perfect for a nice family outing, or an intimate dinner with your other half (or friend), but it's not a party or rowdy place. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This cozy little restaurant offers excellent service, food, and prices. We made online reservations for Sunday brunch, thoroughly enjoyed our food (crusted French toast, eggs benny, bacon & eggs - all great), and someone was always available to refill our coffee and remove dirty plates. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ahh, Brunch.  My favorite meal of the day.  Melanie's was not somewhere I would brunch again.  The good: - the eggs were perfectly soft poached. Until I started ordering poached eggs as part of my 'regular breakfast' I didn't know how difficult it is to cook eggs to a perfect soft poach.  Melanie's does a nice job here. - good quality ingredients - quality bacon and bread.  - great side of fruit. I usually hate the 'free fruit' that comes with breakfasts, but the fruit here was a very small serving of very high quality strawberry and melon that was diligently cleaned.  The bad: - the hashbrowns are terrible. We were here mid-brunch cycle and the hashbrowns were lukewarm. They were clearly pre-prepared and came in a big scoop that looked like a serving of ice cream.  It made me think that they were pre-made and kept in a big aluminum catering/prison food tray and scooped out one serving at a time.  - the ambiance here is horrible. It's boring, bland and reminded Kat F of a hotel lobby and me of a government building. It's the colour of death-tan. - coffee sucks.  The weird-and-telling - the brunch menu had a lot of supper entrees on it like butter chicken and steak.  These people are just confused and sterile."}
{"text":"Loved this place for brunch. Found it on yelp for our last day visiting Toronto. Small and cozy place. Ordered a Bloody Mary and eggs Florentine. They did not have a children's menu but was able to accommodate my son and made him a grilled cheese sandwich with fries. Everything was delicious and fresh. Service was great. Definitely would recommend for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, the place was almost empty except for a large group and a couple of tables. Not what I'm used to when going for weekend brunch in Toronto. Even so, we had to wait 30 minutes for our food because they had a large table. They're not set up to accommodate a large crowd in the kitchen (even though they have the seating for it).   We asked if we could get the fruit that came with our meal while we waited the 35 minutes for our poached eggs to arrive, and the waiter assured us he'd bring something out for us. Nope! He definitely didn't bring anything to tide our hunger over; even the fruit that is supposed to come with our meal. After about half an hour, out popped our stale-looking breakfasts on hot plates.   Once the food arrived it was quite mediocre. The cod cakes on my Newfoundland Breakfast were good but for some reason the entire meal was nauseating. Not sure if the hollandaise was off or something. My friend noticed the poached eggs were too watery.  One of the servers seemed quite inexperienced. The other was friendly and promised to bring our fruit out (and didn't). Not the best service, waitstaff or kitchen.  One of the worst brunches I've ever had. My friend and I both felt nauseous afterwards even though we had different breakfasts. Only items in common were the fruit (which seemed fine), the eggs, and the hollandaise."}
{"text":"A very average brunch spot - I like that it wasn't super busy, even on the Saturday of a holiday long weekend. The service was friendly and prompt. They make a great latte!   The food was okay, but nothing to write home about. I got the Crab Cakes Benny - it was a bit bland and the crab cakes had too strong a taste of onion. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs, and then it was pretty good.   Around the table, a chicken club with fries and the cod cakes Newfoundland breakfast Benny were also ordered.  The chicken club was okay, but the person eating it mentioned to me that it was a bit too saucy. I got to try some of his French fries though...they were pretty yummy! So crunchy but still soft on the inside.  The cod cakes Benny was quite awful, in my opinion. I really did not like it. The combination of fishy/egg flavours did not sit well with me and again, it tasted rather bland.   Overall, it definitely wasn't a bad experience and the service was lovely (and nice to go to a brunch place without a lineup), however - I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Went here on our last day of our vacation. Wish we found this place sooner. Really enjoyed the crab cakes and my sister enjoyed her Belgium waffles. Overall great service and great food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 3.5 stars instead of 3, but don't feel that a full 4 stars is justified either.   Overall, it was pretty good but not the best. We tried the cod and potato cakes Benedict and it was light and tasty, but there was some herb in the dish that just didn't work and threw everything off.   The crab cake Benedict was pretty good aside from the fact that I could taste the old oil that was used to fry them, otherwise this dish would have been great.   The side salads that come with are really good!   Overall, I had a good experience and really appreciated the friendly service. If I'm in the area I might try another round :)"}
