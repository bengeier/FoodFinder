{"text":"Went here for lunch at the reccomendation of co-workers, and it was a very pleasant experience.

Ordered the lunch special Orange peel chicken, and asked for no crab puff (I am allergic to shellfish) and the waitress immediately asked if I wanted extra rice or an extra egg roll to make up for it......how many places will do that?

The Orange peel chicken and the rice were delicious.
My only complaint is that the eggroll tasted very generic....other that that, great food, great service, fair prices.

I will visit more to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. All the Americanized classics. We eat here probably close to once every couple of weeks, usually take-out. My family loves the sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried rice, veggie lo mein, crab rangoons, kung pao chicken...these items we order regularly. They have good service and are always fast and friendly. They have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly! Orange Chicken, House Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken are excellent tasting and seasoned to perfection! Best Chinese food in Surprise, AZ!"}
{"text":"Not to shabby. We will hit this up again. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't label any of the take out boxes so we had no idea what dish went to who. I looked up on yelp what each dish looked like."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Chinese food when you're tired of that fried, Panda Express bullshit. They keep your water cup full & are super attentive. No complaints. Check in for free egg rolls ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Wish I could give zero stars!! Will not return! Ordered take out over the phone and the gentleman on the other end taking the order was rude. When I picked up the food the cashier was also rude! On to the food, I ordered General Tso's chicken (their version was the house special chicken), fried rice, and crab puffs. The chicken was breaded chicken filets what were cut into slices and was in some sort of sauce. Was nothing close General Tso's chicken, chicken was tough and sauce was absolutely disgusting!! I have never had General Tso's chicken that was made up of breaded chicken filets sliced. This was a first and hopefully the last time. Fried rice wasn't even fried rice, it was rice soaked in soy sauce. No veg. or eggs, and I paid extra for it. Crab puffs were a poor excuse for crab rangoon and there was barely any filling and what little there was, had no taste at all! My wife ordered crispy orange beef and it was very dark meat, very tough and chewy, yuck!. She was very disappointed and only ate a couple pieces and tossed the rest. It was a definite waste of almost $30. I would avoid if you actually like Chinese food because this place will put a bad taste in your mouth!!!"}
{"text":"They are great for dine in or take-away. I have their number in my favorites! Fried rice and Almond Cashew Chicken is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is always good and we're always greeted with a smile. 

I always order Sesame Chicken, my husband gets the Beef with Broccoli and my daughter gets the kids Sweet in Sour Chicken. Their lettuce wraps and egg rolls are always good too!"}
{"text":"It's your average American Chinese place. Nothing special. I went in expecting traditional REAL Chinese food.  Pretty much panda express tasting food. 

Service rushes customers confuses orders and brought out my food 10 minutes earlier than the others in my party. Not professional. 

Not returning."}
{"text":"Food was just ok....I would rather have had Panda Express.  We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Buddha's Delight and lemon chicken....nothing like California Chinese food"}
{"text":"I am also vegan and was very excited to find this place right next to our gym! The orange tofu was to die for and the curry vegetables were amazing. My husband and I both agreed that it was some of the best Chinese food we've ever had in Arizona"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Phoenix.  I want down to the Chinese cultural center and found the food bland and almost processed.  This food is fresh and homemade - simply great!"}
{"text":"Great food, super quick service with a smile. Hard to beat their prices, especially the lunch specials! We've eaten here a dozen times this year and have been impressed with the food and speed of service each visit. Highly recommend you give them a try (especially for a quick lunch)!"}
{"text":"big buddah is my favorite chinese resturant 
my favorite dish is shrimp with lobster sauce.
very nice atmosphere. and if you have any allergies like shell 
they will be extra carfull with your order my wife loves it there i give this place an a+"}
{"text":"This is one of the best by far. Great menu. Fresh ingredients and everything flavorful and delicious tasting. The service was 1st class and owner or manager was very courteous,  friendly and you could sense the pride and passion in his demeanor. 
 My wife and I had two lunch menu items with beverages and the bill was less than twenty bucks. Excellent!
We're planning to go again with friends before returning home after this holiday weekend."}
{"text":"I have to say this Chinese food is compared to NY Chinese food. It was great. I love there Pork fried rice...Yes, when it is called Fried rice it is fried not like some of these places the rice is white and all in a clump with peas & carrots that is not fried rice. The owners are very nice and there staff. I have ordered plenty of times from Big Buddah and I have to say it is the best."}
{"text":"My bf and I have found our go-to Chinese joint. We like to place an order for pickup. We get a few different things to try (beef and broccoli, sweet and sour pork, and cashew chicken)
Along with noodles and rice. Their fries rice is a must have. We spend around $27 and it's enough to feed us both on 2-3 meals. They are so nice in person and on phone and it's always easy to place an order. It's no wonder they are in the best of Surprise."}
{"text":"The orange chicken, egg roll, and crab puffs were all very good! This is one busy place. My order was takeout and everything was hot and delicious. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Japanese food ever... It's way overpriced for what it is... Crap.
I Moved here in December from the Midwest and was craving egg rolls and stir fry. Looked at reviews and this place has the best reviews...

I'm so confused if I am missing something about this place or is there something in the water at the restaurant that makes people believe the food is good?


-The spring rolls were over-cooked and extremely small.
-The beef and broccoli was tough. 
-the teriyaki chicken was just awful. The meat is either overcooked or just not tenderized at all.
-crab puffs- nasty

This place was so bad I won't ever even give it another chance.




However,
The Seafood/Shrimp blossom soup was legit."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service a little to fast. The veggies weren't cooked enough for my taste still had alot of crunch in them."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch. The food was so salty. Spring rolls were delicious. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've found so far!  If you eat in, the servers are very  nice and helpful- they even taped some paper up to help block the sun from shining in my eyes!  If you take out, they get it out to you as fast as possible while you wait in the chairs nearby.  

Our standards are the lemon chicken and sesame chicken.  The sesame is some of the best I have ever had ANYWHERE- the chicken is real, white meat, and tasty.  The lemon chicken breading usually ends up falling off, but that's OK with me since the chicken is the best part, anyways!  Lemon chicken is served as a chicken breast pounded flat then the whole thing is coated, fried, and covered in sauce.  The sauces are a little on the gelatinous side, but are delicious and plentiful.  I mix the extras in with my rice.  My only complaint is that there is no brown rice option, only white.  But eh, I can splurge.  

We can get away spending around $20, and for 2 people to eat well AND have enough leftovers for 2 lunches, I consider that a success!"}
{"text":"My parents and I went to here after leaving a previous restaurant for poor service. Big Buddha was the the complete opposite! They were attentive, the food was steaming hot and delicious. Definitely recommend for dine-in or event take out. The Singapore Noodles and Honey Walnut Chicken are definitely must tries."}
{"text":"Lunch specials 7 days a week. Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food. 

My wife has special dietary needs, and a request for a dish with no onion, garlic, or pepper (hot)... Unfortunately the standard white sauce has white pepper, and the waitress forgot this. As we started to eat, Pammy discovered the pepper, the attentive waitress knew something was wrong and wanted to make it right. The other waiter got involved and they both insisted that she get a fresh meal without pepper, so special sauce was made fresh and her new meal arrived in minutes.

Since the first meal with pepper could easily be put in a box, for me to eat later (I have no restrictions), and since the second meal came with all the sides (rice, eggroll, and crab puff) we wanted to pay for all three meals. But the staff would not let us, insisting it was 'on the house'. 

Of course we will be back many times. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, great tasting food with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Best place to go for Chinese food. Tried other places and walked out. I'm a chef so I am very picky"}
{"text":"Don't take my word for it or you have to do is look at how busy their take-out services are. So happy to have finally found good, no, very good, Chinese and the surprise area!!"}
{"text":"Big Buddha has always been a favorite lunch spot for me, good size portions and a lot of variety for their lunch special at a good price but this hair was free! It's unfortunate because the orange chicken has always been my favorite even though they have downsized their portions, my chicken was smaller than I ever remember. Big Buddha has officially topped my \"do not eat at list\""}
{"text":"Food is always prepared fresh, and always ready in a reasonable amount of time even when they seem to be swamped. Only issue is it's a bit pricey for 3 people it's about $40 with tax. Not the cheapest but food and service is solid."}
{"text":"This is a solid, family owned, Chinese restaurant. They are very friendly and generally pretty fast. The restaurant is a little small but the food is good. I recommend the spicy beef lo mein. The prices are fair and the portions are great."}
{"text":"Clean, waiters are polite. Food is good. Great vegetarian dishes. Lunch specials are cheap, Dinner prices are above average.. Not much dining space.. only about seven tables (its very small)"}
{"text":"They have wonderful service and aim to please! Their sesame seed chicken is wonderful.  My mother didn't care for their beef fried rice and the waiter noticed she didn't eat it when we got the bill.  Without her even complaining he adjusted the bill.  That is world class service!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and tried different dishes each time. I've not yet been disappointed I don't think I will be. My recommendation for anyone is there \"Beef Chow Fun\". From what I understand it is a more traditional noodle dish. They also made their orange peel chicken their own. It is a chicken breast fillet fried with tempura batter and covered with their orange peel sauce. The service is always good and the wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken lo mein lunch special, took quite a while to receive it...but it was pork. Quite a conversation getting it changed. Pork and chicken were both chewy and overcooked, no seasoning whatsoever. Lo mein was ok, but had a strange oily aftertaste. Egg drop soup also had no seasoning. Egg roll was very strange tasting...couldn't really identify what was inside even after breaking it apart (I was told it was carrot mostly). Red sweet/sour sauce was oddly spicy, but not bad. I had been in this place twice before and was underwhelmed with the food, although the service was excellent and the lunch prices were reasonable. I like to support local businesses, but definitely wont go back, even though it is close to my home."}
{"text":"I am a very happy Vegan at Big Buddha! If I ever stop craving the curry the other vegetarian menu items are just as delicious. And everything on the menu can be adapted and made vegetarian upon request. The orange tofu is perfectly crisp and satisfying to share or with the addition of some vegetables. My family especially enjoys the orange chicken, sesame chicken, and the beef chow fun. I also appreciate the graphic design and attention to aesthetics, even the carry out boxes. The delightful owners/servers love what they do and take pride in it, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The chicken chow mein is good, soft noodles, not hard."}
{"text":"REALLY disappointed with our food. The house Tsos chicken was dry chicken breast with some weird soggy breading on the bottom. The beef skewers were cold and dry and had no flavor. The egg rolls were nasty! They had some soggy goop inside. The only okay thing was the pork fried rice even though it was super salty and drenched in soy sauce. None of the food we got was worth it. Worst 40$ I spent on take out. Unfortunate because we only get take out once in a while and when we finally decide to get take out it's horrible!"}
{"text":"My very favorite Chinese food in the Phoenix valley.  My all time favorite is the chicken curry.  Never had better even in China Town in San Francisco . Very friendly service and always made to feel welcome. I highly recommend you trying their food, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Loved it!
Very nice place for a Sunday afternoon lunch.
Sweet and sour chicken was very tasty.
Everything was fresh and HOT!
Great value,lots of food for the money. Has lunch menu every day.
Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious orange chicken! The crab rangoons were a bit disappointing but the chicken made up for it."}
{"text":"Probably the best orange chicken I've ever had. And I've never had anything less than good quality here. Service is good too, even when it's busy. All at a reasonable price. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and found this place via YELP,,,what a find!! It was 30 mins before closing and their servers were prompt and polite.  Ordered a quick appetizer of pot stickers, yummy,  served with a great sauce.  We then had Kung Pao chicken with white ricr, wow, one of the best Ive ever had.  White meat chicken, perfectly cooked veggies and the sauce was perfect with a lil spicy kick!!  When we come back to Surprise, AZ we are definitely making a stop here!!!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before, and hearing such positive word of mouth. I had to try it. I can say there lunch special is huge and at a great price. I loved that they were able to modify the items to gluten free. I order take out there quick and its hott.. Thank you big budi"}
{"text":"We love Big Buddha! The staff is always friendly and helpful plus their food is delicious. We love love their mango ice tea also! Prices are reasonable as well as their portion sizes. Its a small restaurant but well kept and always clean!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Big Buddha! The food is always great!  We esspecially appreciate that the chicken is good quality in all their recipes. Also, we love the spicy boiled won tons and signapore rice noodles! Great stuff everytime! So glad its out near our house!"}
{"text":"We went there for a late lunch on a Saturday.  I agree that the fried rice was a bit weird, but my orange tofu was heavenly.  Perfectly crispy on the outside, still tofu-y on the inside.  That tofu is the reason Big Buddha earned 4 stars from me.  No other Chinese place around here even does orange tofu.  I'll ask for plain steamed rice next time.

I loved that the lunch special was offered on the weekends, too, and we didn't have to order dinner-sized portions.  And at around $5 a plate, a pretty good deal!

I did not love the one song that was playing on a loop during our meal.  No idea what that was about.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great. Not to mention their lunch specials!!! My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch is such a nice experience here.  The staff is great,   Food is awesome.  Prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually love this place but I was really disappointed today.  I got the Mongolian beef and the beef looked and tasted as though it had been reheated a few times as it was over cooked ( appeared burnt and tough.  It was also supposed to be very spicy but was quite bland.  
I should have sent it back but we were in a bit of a hurry so I ate most of it anyway.  Won't be so nice if it happens again"}
{"text":"Great food!! Lunch specials are amazing. Entree plus soup of the day, egg roll and crab puff."}
{"text":"I have tried many different plates here and they just don't spice it up enough for me.   Every time I go in there, they serve every one else in there but me.  I don't know what it is or if I have bad kharma or what but the service hasn't been great and the food is just ok.  I do like the pot stickers though and should just order those when I go there."}
{"text":"Don't look any further for better Chinese food because you won't find any. The quality and taste of the food is amazing. The staff is great and work really hard. The only improvement would be to have a larger take out area, but not much they can do about that. The BBQ pork egg foo young is heaven!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite chinese place in all of Surprise and more than likely out of any place I have tried throughout my life. Every dish I have ever ordered has been fabulous. The people who own/work here are very sweet. The location itself is somewhat small inside but also offers outside patio dining. While I have dined in on occasion, I prefer takeout to get my chinese fix! The orange chicken is literally my all time favorite dish!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out This particular restaurant. The food was excellent and well priced! The portion sizes were enormous and the staff were incredible friendly and very professional! I have found my new favorite Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"I like them because in my opinion the food is less greasy than your normal Chinese food place. I actually feel pretty good after pigging out on it. This is our go-to place. They also pack your food in a sturdy cardboard tray which makes it easy to handle when bringing home. Have not dined in yet but the dining area seems nice as well."}
{"text":"Love, love this placem I used to get take out 4 times a week and eat here every time my girlfriend and I went out for lunch. Service is great also."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and wonderful staff.  The food is well priced, well made and delivered fast. Unlike many places that seem to cycle through the same three flavors there is great variety in the dishes at Big Buddha.  Glad to have them in Surprise."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing price, amazing staff!
Definitely going to be out for sure Chinese food place!"}
{"text":"So hard finding yummy Chinese food in the valley.
This is our new go-to place for pick up. Convenient location in Surprise and QUALITY food. Our food isn't saturated in sauce, it is crispy but not overcooked.
It just tastes fresh! 
Friendly people on the phone and clean location. We get 2 orders and pork fried rice and 2 people can have 2 1/2 meals each with their servings.
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We usually get Take-Out from here and always enjoy the food, there is always plenty for the price.  We have sat in the restaurant a few times and the wait staff has always been friendly.  Typically get hot and sour soup (bit different, but in a good way), Orange Beef (my Wife loves it, but a bit sweet for me)  and Sesame Chicken (yum) . Had one bad experience with take out I feel I should mention, where all the take-out we got from there one time was all extra spicy. It almost lead me to maybe they misunderstood when I said no spice, because we had kids eating with us at the time.

Update: we don't go here as much due to inconsistency of the dishes.  I wouldn't discourage it  though."}
{"text":"Definitely worth stopping by and trying. 

This is my favorite Chinese food restaurant in the Surprise/Sun City area. I do not enjoy the Americanized Chinese food that is served in most places and find it difficult parting with my money to try Chinese food. I was in the area and tried it on a whim (and some help from my fellow Yelpers). I am so glad I did. 

It is a smaller restaurant located in a small strip mall area off of the 303 and Greenway, but it is a fabulous find.  I have gone during their lunch hour (11a-2pm) and found it to be busy, yet clean and well run.

The food is a solid 3.5 to 4. I have tried several dishes and none of them have been greasy, bland, overly salty or stale. Each time I have ordered, the food has been freshly prepared and served promptly.

The service is a solid 4. I have always been greeted and seated promptly. I am served promptly and they bring the bill shortly after you finish your plate. Our glasses were constantly being refilled without our request.

 I have overheard several phone conversations and other patrons asking about ingredients and preparations of the various dishes. I appreciate how the staff take the time to answer any questions (without attitudes or sighs) asked of them, even if they answered that question multiple times that day.

Their lunch menu has a great variety of dishes and all below $10.  Their family style dishes are also of good value, but each dish serves 2-3 people."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice ambience and decor. Very busy.  Ordered food to go.  Had to wait for over 40 minutes. Loved the chicken curry and hot and sour soup.  The family loved all of the food I brought home, Beef and broccoli, orange peel chicken, honey walnut shrimp.  The chow mein noodles were different.  The sauce was a dark brown sauce that I didn't care for.  The flavors in the dishes were different than what I'm used to when it comes to Chinese food but it was a nice change in flavors.  Guess we found a new favorite Chinese food place."}
{"text":"I have not been to this restaurant for a few months and tonight I was disappointed with my take out order.  The lo Mein was dry and tasteless and the pork in my pork fried rice was totally dried out.  It will be quite a long time before I return to this restaurant.  It is so frustrating to get home with dinner when you have been working all day and your dinner is not good."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I really like their orange chicken. It's not your typical orange chicken. The kung pao chicken is also delicious. They're very friendly and I will continue to visit Big Buddha!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here... And hands down love this place!!! They served our big party perfectly and the food is outstanding!!!!! A+A++++"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome! The food is good and large portions. I'm a huge fan of basically all foods that use asian spices and so far this place is my fav asian restuarant in Surprise. I do have to say that I like my food a bit spicier but that's what my sriracha keychain is for."}
{"text":"My family and I have tried this place several times and have been disappointed each time. Sometimes the food is cooked well but other times it is been overcooked. It is also very expensive for what you get. The restaurant itself is very small so if you go on a busy night be prepared to wait a long time.  Most of their business comes from takeout but it is not very good."}
{"text":"went here with Jennie D. and food was shiggdiggilly good! Jen had her vegetarian Tofu and I had the   egg foo young. we split the green beans in brown sauce..Very fresh and steamin hot ! Staff werent super friendly but took good care of us. The karate school next door was having a Halloween party so they brought in mini cupcakes and passed them out...Jen and I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Great food great service, sux that it's kinda hidden I've been missing eating there because I had no idea it was there and I'm within walking distance. Asian work force there which helps ring authentic to me. They are like family now do yourself a favor get cha some!!"}
{"text":"I love Big Buddha. By far the best chinese food in surprise. Now the previous statement is not saying much, but we do what we can in the boonies right? I would recommend the beef chow fun, the chicken Egg Foo Young and the Kung Pow Chicken. If you go during lunch you can't beat the price. If I remember right it's like $6 for an entree, soup, and a crab puff. Unlike any of the other chinese food joints in Surprise, it's actually worth a visit."}
{"text":"Family decided we wanted some Chinese for lunch.  So what do I do, jump on Yelp of course!  This place exceeded all of our expectations!  Great service and delicious food.  As said by others, I'll agree this was some of the best orange chicken I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't matter if you dine in or out the service here is always great! The food is great as well. Hot n sour soup is full of goodies, the beef chow fun is so tasty. My favorite has to be the Singapore rice noodles, just the right amount of heat. I'd get that 5th star from me if there was delivery."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and trying out different restaurants primarily due to the heat....who wants to cook at home with 110+ degree temperatures:)   The restaurant is small but wasn't too crowded during our visit (middle of the week around 5PM).  The service was attentive.  Our server made a mistake with my order which was corrected immediately with no issues.  The portions were generous leaving us plenty to take home for another meal.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this restaurant.  I found it on yelp with decent reviews so thought it would be a good choice.  I went on their website to check out their menu and saw a coupon for free cream puffs with a $25 purchase.  Well my order was well over the $25 min so I asked if they would honor the coupon I saw on their website.  they told me they will only accept it if I print it out and show it to them.  I explained that I was visiting from out of state and didn't have a printer available, but they still refused to honor it.

That left me on a sour note, but I was hungry and craving chinese, so i let it go.  We picked up our order and brought it back home.  I have had much better chinese food at Americanized chains.  The rice was the worst, it was cold and very dry, almost crunchy.  I ordered sweet and sour pork, The vegetables wernt cooked at all and the pork was very chewy and tough to eat.  Sadly there was more greasy breading then pork to be had.

I'll try a different place next time to satisfy my chinese craving."}
{"text":"Great food. It was quality food, and for 25 dollars I got 3 entrees and a teriyaki chicken meal. Full and plenty of food to take home."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd try and probably my last. The first time I played it safe & just ordered Chicken teriyaki, it was ok. Not great, not bad, just ok. A little on the bland side, not much teriyaki flavor. 

Today I ordered Mongolian beef & mongolian chicken.  I redeemed my Yelp coupon for two free egg rolls. They actually gave me 4 egg rolls & 2 crab puffs. 

The egg rolls looked different than any egg roll I've ever had & tasted different. Don't know what to say. The crab puff was ok. The red sauce is watery. 

Both Mongolians were spicy hot and again lacking in flavor. Plenty of heat no flavor. The beef was a bit on the tough side. 

It's so disappointing!! I very much was hoping that we finally had a good Chinese food restaurant in Surprise. 

I'm going to San Fran in a couple of weeks. I'll have to get my fill of Chinese there!"}
{"text":"Really, for me 3.5 (-.5 for too much salt) but the evening deserved rounding up to to 4.

We had a pleasant meal. We were a party of five and wanted as quiet a table as possible and the restaurant was more than accommodating.

Staff was friendly. Service was timely.

We asked about MSG and they were forthright about what to order, what not to order and where it could be eliminated. So no problems there.

Eggs rolls were good (they have MSG)

The potstickers came - atypically for me - in a broth. I thought they had brought the wrong food. But that's how they were prepared. And they were very tasty as was the broth.

Five of us split four dishes. Mongolian beef was the best and very good. Kung Pao chicken was was good but the peanuts seemed like an afterthought rather than a part of the dish. Buddha Delight mixed vegetables were okay. Fried rice disappointed in that the pork and other protein was dried out. 

The biggest issue for me was that I felt completely overcome by salt a short while after dinner but that might just be me."}
{"text":"This is my happy place :) AMAZING food and the staff is so friendly! I usually order the orange chicken, Mongolian beef but I recently had it as chicken and that is a game changer! Also the pepper steak beef is so good! I'm actually drooling thinking about their food. *drools* They also have the best egg rolls I have ever had at a Chinese restaurant and they have a different type of egg drop soup that is called chicken corn and it's better than regular egg drop soup!!! This place is the best"}
{"text":"Very hard to find a Chinese Restaurant in the Phoenix area that makes Egg Foo Yung with the meat mixed inside the pattie. The Egg Foo Yung here is some of the best I ever had.
Made properly not a frozen patty with stuff on top.
Service was great and place is clean and comfortable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"With a family of 6 we haven't found a restaurant to satisfy all appetites until now. The orange chicken, sweet & sour chicken, Mongolian beef, pepper steak, egg rolls, and crab puffs are our favorite dishes/appetizers. The food is always fresh and cooked to perfection...we crave it!"}
{"text":"Hmm. went back a few times, not sure what happened but the food got greasy. We have yet to return."}
{"text":"Not many Chinese food options out in Surprise, but this one is the best. I'm a big fan of the orange peel chicken, although I do agree with the reviewer complaining that the breading does fall of the chicken when trying to eat it. Pork fried rice is also delish. I'd stay away from the crab puffs...small and not very tasty. They do have awesome egg rolls...get 'em instead. I've always done take out here and the food is always ready when they tell me it will be, comes in a nice carry out container and the orders are always correct. Next time I'm in the mood for Chinese, I know who I'll call!"}
{"text":"I moved to surprise and really missed the Chinese food I grew up on me in Peoria! (Big heng and good China) 

After trying Chen wok and being disappointed I was hesitant to try BB but I am so glad I did! It's not hands down my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Ok chinese food, I like 2 or 3 others better in Surprise.

I have some friends that think it is the best ever, so maybe it's just me.

Nice people, good service."}
{"text":"Slim pickins for Chinese food out here in the land of Surprise but this place is fairly priced and has good food.  We just tried their lunch special and it was a great value and no issues with the rice.  On top of good food, the service is always on the mark and very friendly.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been looking for a delicious Chinese food restaurant in the NW valley.  We also didn't want a typical chain restaurant.  Well this place was amazing!  Clean with a nice atmosphere and an outdoor patio.  The food was homemade and delicious.  The owner came out from the kitchen to get to know us.  She's down to earth with a true passion for both her food and her customers.  She had us try her spicy wonton soup.  This is the only place you'll find it and I can't wait to eat it again!!!  It was so good...I forgot to take a photo!

This locally owned and operated business deserves my business and yours...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I liked the egg foo yong but the food in general is not consistent."}
{"text":"i have lived in vancouver bc many years - married to Chinese Canadian - I have had many a chinese meal in essence - Big buddha is the best Chinese in Phoenix i have come across.  i will make it a point to go here on my trips to phoenix. i was surprised really. Home Run!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for lunch.  It was a bit late for lunch ~around 1:30 or so in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  There were a few other people when we arrived.  We were seated right away, drinks were served and menus were browsed.  Overall the menu seems to have basic Chinese dishes that you would expect.  They also have a handful of lunch combination selections.
I ordered the Crispy Lemon Chicken (white meat).  It was served with a good sized portion of white rice.  My friend ordered the Tofu Curry Lunch combo which came with soup(of the day - no vegan option), an egg roll (they have pork in them), fried rice, and a cream cheese wonton.
I was a little disappointed with my lemon dish.  Overall it was good, crispy, large portion, hot and served quickly, but it was described as tany and instead it was quite sweet.  It was more like lemon candy than the tang dish I have come to expect when associating with lemon.
I was told the Curry dish was good, nothing extraordinary, but good.  The service was good, fast, friendly and reasonably priced.  I think for the prices and the amount of food that is served it was decent and as other reviewers have stated, there are few options in Surprise for Chinese when the craving hits.  I live away from the area, so I won't make a habit of visiting, but I'm not sorry I went."}
{"text":"All the reviews are spot on.. awesome food.. general tso's was excellent!! Service was spot on.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in a while. My wife and I really enjoyed the sesame chicken. I highly recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was all great! Egg drop soup, spicy wonton appetizer, crispy orange beef and vegetable lo mein.  Definitely the best chinese food I've had in Surprise."}
{"text":"We finally got around to going to this restaurant after hearing several recommendations from friends.  We were very pleased with the friendly and courteous welcome as well as very good tasting food.  

Shrimp Curry was very tasty though far too many green pepper chunks, but they were easily picked out.  Kung Pau Chicken was tasty, not quite as hot as I like it but very tasty. And the Fried Orange Peel Chicken was very different and a nice addition to our sampling.  I would find it too rich by itself as there is no vegetable ingredients.

A crab puff and egg roll was included, one of each for both of us.  Hot and Sour Soup for me and Egg Drop for her was also excellent!

We sat on the patio which was unpleasant for the first ten minutes as two guys were smoking while finishing their drinks from dinner but they left when they were finished with their drinks.

The staff was very friendly and the older gentleman was very funny yet courteous and professional.

We will return often in the future, anxious to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"If you are into Asian food, this is the place around town, let's face it, Arizona is the state still behind in trends with food, I know there's a lot of places to eat but nothing to appealing to be excited to go out of your way....only food chains and very elegant places but food with low intensity in taste.
So when you find a place with Awesome taste and great prices is a must to come back over and over, Why? Because there is really not too many choices! :) let me just say SOUP!! was so Tasty that I'm looking forward to order it again.
All the other dishes we order, out of this world, is either I'm too excited because been a native Californian we find great taste anywhere, so I feel I found one that I will come back and enjoy my food. 
Can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"It had been quite some time since I ate at this restaurant, and I was anxious to give it another chance.  Sadly, there are still problems with the food.  They fixed any issues with their rice, but the Crispy Orange Beef was tough and flavorless, the Mongolian Beef was so salty I practically had to give myself dialysis.  

The service is pleasant and attentive, but there is a LOT of room for improvement  in quality and consistency with the food.  Their one saving grace was the Szechuan Green Bean entree with shrimp and tofu.  This dish will likely be the only thing I order there again, until I see proof that things have improved."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is the best in town.  Hot delicious and to much food to eat also the lunch special is available daily.  GREAT"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best in the Surprise area.  It met all the requirements to be a five star restaurant to me, and it is a great business in the neighborhood:
1. Family own
2.family friendly
3. Great costumer service
4. Good food, I meant it gooooood food.
5. Price is right ( they give you tons of food for what you pay)
6.Diversity 
7. Outdoor tables.

Bring your family and friends, it's honestly a good place to eat.
Keep the good job Big Buddha!"}
{"text":"This place is #Awesome! Family owned business,  kind people and great food. The Seasame Chicken is the best I've ever had. Egg Rolls and the Mayo Chicken as appetizers are also hands down the best. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness it's good. My husband and I  ordered every week for 9 mo! And we were never disappointed! My husband was sick and I think this was all that made him happy. Thank you Big Buddha for making yummy food, (sweet and sour pork, curry shrimp, shrimp fried Rice, egg rolls, mongolian beef, ... all yummy,) and friendly staff! Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and the lunch combo is so reasonable I don't know how they can do it!"}
{"text":"Great service delicious food always satisfied can't ask for more :).  We love coming here for lunch the specials are great and the service is always friendly  :)"}
{"text":"On Thursday, March 16 at 6pm, I stopped by and ordered Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and Pepper Beef to go. When my wife and I opened the boxes, we found some sort of very salty, brown \"stuff.\"  We have eaten in many Chinese restaurants over the years and never encountered anything like this. Being brave, we  ate a small amount of each meal and threw out the rest..  Tom and Donna Butler, Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"Been here many times. And I do enjoy their authentic Chinese dishes. I am not a fan of their Americanized Chinese dishes. Not bad but just not a fan. I'm also a little biased because my family owned 2 Chinese restaurants. But the place is very nice and super friendly."}
{"text":"Big Buddha is a great \"go to\" Chinese restaurant. I highly recommend the eggplant and tofu dish -- I could just eat that and be happy. We have both dined in and ordered take out, and we are usually pretty happy."}
{"text":"We were happy to find this place, initially. The food, staff, service were all excellent, for about our first three visits. Hot, huge, tasty, friendly. Then we took some new friends there, after bragging about it. The service was ok, the soup was sent back because it was barely warm. Disappointing visit. Ain't that the way. Then we ordered takeout, over the phone. The person taking the order was english challenged, but indicated we would get the free egg rolls as advertised on their web page. We did not. We will try the place again, because they are the best in this area, even tho they are a 20 minute drive for us."}
{"text":"Best Orange Chicken I've ever had! We've only eaten takeout from this restaurant so I can't comment on the service. I can say that they are quick with takeout orders and the place appears clean. Did I mention that they have the best Orange Chicken!?!!"}
{"text":"First visit and very memorable. Twenty one lunch specials are served until 3:30 pm.  People were pouring in between 2:30 - 3:00 pm.  All the choices are under $8 and include fried rice, soup of the day, an egg roll and a crab puff, all very delicious.  I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan that came with chicken and veggies for $7.  The dish was loaded with tender chicken and a variety of veggies all cooked perfectly. The sauce was a little salty but the hot tea for 50 cents helped a lot. We ordered Pork Chop Suey for $7 which was also loaded with Pork and delicious.  You can also order wine or beer if you prefer spirits!  Service was very fast.  We look forward to dining again at this wonderful restaurant or possibly carrying out. Easy to find in the strip mall near the 303."}
{"text":"Went there last nite, ordered the Shrimp Egg Foo Young....it was horrible. It looked like meat patties instead of omlets. At least the management gave me a refund."}
{"text":"Wonderful Chinese restaurant! The atmosphere is nothing fancy, but the food is fresh and delicious. My sweet and sour chicken had large slices of chicken without too much breading. My grandmother had the Buddha's Delight and was very happy with all the vegetables. Service was outstanding. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"We love this place!!!! Good food,  excellent portions, friendly service, fair prices.  We enjoy their outdoor patio,  I do find the inside a little cramped, but that's just me.  I love the fact they honestly try to accommodate my desire for extremely spicy food. It is tough to find really spicy food in an area that caters to an older crowd with a penchant for the bland, and complaining.  I have found it necessary and helpful in our area to speak up if you love spice when eating out. I typically order extra egg rolls, with extra mustard,  the twice cooked pork, I  also LOVE the cold coconut and lemongrass sake. It is super yummy, and refreshing on a hot Arizona evening.  The owner always stops and talks to us when we stop by,  whether on a date night, or an afternoon lunch with my kids. Sure you could go elsewhere and pay FAR more, for something  \"more authentic \", but for my family and I Big Buddha is awesome!!! A local small business,  serving great food, at a great price,  with a personal touch.  We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Big Buddha is probably one of the best places in the northwest valley. The food is consistently good and the service has always been great. The Hot & Sour soup is absolutely delicious. I haven't had anything on the menu that I did not like."}
{"text":"Went to Big Budda again with some friends for lunch and as usual, great service and delicious food!! I have ordered their Sesame Chicken for the last five years. so good!  I tried their Orange Chicken and it also was delicious! Even when I have placed a To Go order, they are always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"At first we really liked it....until about the 3rd time. We realized that everything was salty and kind of all tasted the same. We haven't been back. 

BTW why don't chinese restaurants give out almond cookies anymore?"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean. Service was good. The food is amazing! Came for lunch I got the Moo Goo Gai pan (chicken and vegetables ) lunch comes with soup, fried rice, egg roll, and crab puff. My mom got the sesame chicken lunch combo. Mine was good veggies are fresh and crunchy, Sesame chicken was tasty as well. My kids shared the teriyaki chicken off the little Buddha menu that came with a choice of drink, soup and fried rice. They both ate all of it. For all 3 meals all drinking water came out to about 22 bucks. Prices are reasonable. We will for sure come back time and time again! Happy we found our local Chinese spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a great Chinese restaurant, and our local search is OVER!  We went out on a date night, had heard of Big Buddha in passing, checked out reviews and decided to give it a try.  WELL...we arrived at 830 pm they close at 9 pm).  We were greeted right away in a friendly manner, we were shown to a table and service was AWESOME, QUICK and FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND TASTED FRESH!  We had a wonderful meal, were NOT rushed by staff, everyone was super nice and we ended up having a great evening.  Price was very fair as well!  We had eggrolls, beef skewers, egg drop soup, fried rice, beef and broccoli, orange chicken for (2) and everything was delicious and hot.  Meal came out to only $36....considering we had a beer, soda and everything I mentioned...GREAT VALUE!   If you want good Chinese Food in Surprise, I agree with Floyd C...WE FOUND IT!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Went during lunchtime, good specials, service was on point, place was clean and welcoming. But most importantly, the food was delish!  I 
had the moo gai pan and my bf had the Kung pao chicken. You could tell it was all freshly cooked with fresh vegetables. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ate at Big Buddha. Let me tell you it was AMAZING!!! From the moment they answered the phone for my order to the time I was walking out it was the best customer service I have ever gotten! Which was refreshing since we had such horrible service from Jims Burgers down the street! The food was AMAZING! Ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken-was of the highest quality! Fresh chicken, crispy on the outside and tinder on the inside! Mongolian beef was great! Hot and sour soup was great! Even used the coupon for the egg rolls! We will now become regulars here! Thank you for being a local restaurant that sets the standards in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Based on everybody's reviews, I HAD to try this place out.  I mean really HAD to.  I'm Chinese so I KNOW Chinese food and there's not a whole lot of places to go that's decent on our side of town.  So it's still a good 15-20 miles away from us but we were in the neighborhood so we decided to give it a try.  WOW!

Granted, not the best Chinese food I ever had but definitely the best I've had in the West Valley.  I would say if it were in any other place like NY, LA, Houston, I would have given it 3 stars but for Phoenix, definitely 4.  The service was also very good, which you don't usually see in Chinese restaurants.  I ain't hatin' either - it's just the way it is.  :)

We  had the Beef Chow Fun, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Crispy Orange Beef.  The COB wasn't very spicy which was fine by us, but had a nice sweet tangy flavor to it.  It didn't taste like it had much of a layer on it - almost like they  just fried the beef - but it tasted pretty good.  Never eaten it that way before.The HWS had huge shrimp but not a whole lot of it.  Which was fine.  I thought the mayo sort of overpowered the whole dish but it was still better than any other place I've had in the Valley.  Finally, the BCF was the best dish.  I'm a fan of big noodles and they did a good job with the flavoring.

We really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely come again.  All the flavoring in their food was pretty good, if not awesome.  Not super salty like Pei Wei can be (my I-don't-have-any-other-choice-but-to-come-here option) but rather just the right touch.  

When we got there, pretty much all their tables were full and the conversations I heard several of the patrons had with the waiters/waitress was, \"Thanks for coming again, see you next week/time.\"  DEFINITELY a good sign.  We weren't disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I love there Orange chicken and there sweet and sour chicken! The best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. Pickup or In restaurant so nice. Only thing is a pretty small space to sit and enjoy a meal, but over all very good! Definitely Recommend it!"}
{"text":"The only Chinese place I go to... I usually get the Mongolian Beef, it is very good. Sometimes I get the Beef chow fun too.
And they are friendly and FAST!"}
{"text":"I waited until I've been here a couple times to try different things on the menu. This place is awesome! Everything is fresh and made to order and it shows. The orange chicken is a highlight and the lo mein dishes are as well. Great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"I came with my friend to this restaurant looking for some good Chinese food. We sat down and ordered within 10 minutes. I ordered a sprite, wonton soup and crispy soft tofu, my friend ordered a coke, vegetable low mien and vegetable fried rice. We got our sodas first, my friends soda was flat and there was a black floating spec in mine! We had our server get me a new soda of course and it was fine after. I got both my plates relatively quickly, but my friend waited for over an HOUR to get even her first plate! Other people were being served faster than her. Eventually the food got to us but upon further inspection it was still made wrong! The fried rice tasted like burnt char and the noodles came to our table cold too...
Tl;dr this experience sucked, NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place is just OKAY.   There are a few places in Surprise that serve much tastier Chinese food."}
{"text":"We just moved here and we're looking for a good Chinese place, After reading the amazing reviews (and the few that weren't good who I'm convinced were at a different restaurant), we decided to give it a try! This is our new favorite place to eat. The service is amazing. Everyone seems to get along and the atmosphere is great. The food was SO fresh and it didn't take all day to get it. We will definitely be back. The prices are great as well, very reasonable and you get a ton of food."}
{"text":"They were on it with the service, my soda glass never got empty and the wait staff were extremely friendly and provided my little granddaughter with all the fortune cookies she needed to keep her happy while we ate. 
The food was fresh, fast and yummy. Four of us ordered different items off the menu plus 2 appetizers. All of us agreed this place is on our list to return to. Side point-the bathroom was spotless!"}
{"text":"We've been here three times. We aren't likely to return. The atmosphere and prices are just ok. The food is so so. The wait staff have always been kind."}
{"text":"The food is just OK. Nothing amazing where I HAVE to go back for. Overpriced. Oh get this, if you want hot sauce for your take out order... They charge extra! Who does that???  I didn't ask for 2-3 hot sauce. Just 1. They want to charge me for hot sauce? That's ridiculous!! I'm never going back. Poor customer service by doing that!"}
{"text":"food is ok, no delivery, expensive, and there are no such things as combination platters. So if you want beef and broccoli and shrimp fried rice, you have to order each separate so its about 17 dollars per person."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Comparable to what you would get in Chinatown in cities with a high Chinese population. Consistent, clean, authentic. Highly recommend the chow fun, Singapore rice noodle, orange chicken, twice cooked pork, and honey walnut shrimp. Everything we have tried is great!"}
{"text":"Aw Cmon! The reviews that are impressed must be just off the boat!  Watery Curry.  Really watery...when I returned it, and i mentioned that curry should be creamy, the front guy said ...are ya ready?...\"maybe needs more corn starch\"...!!!  L.A. quality?  NOT! I lived in Santa Monica for 12 years and every time, as a local Surprise resident, I am 'forced' to take a(nother) shot and try the take-out from Buuddah, it is a major disappointment.  I have had two or three decent meals out of approx 12 over the past 3 years from them.. They are SO SPOILED to have the monopoly on Asian locations out here. 
Their egg roll is a spring roll! nothing to it at all.
If you do get fresh food it is because you got lucky...AND got there early. 
I love pork fried rice...and two years ago they had a pretty darn good one...BUT no mas! Soy sauce heavy, no scallion bump, soggy bean sprouts...just no 'pop' or enticing flavor. This is season out here! But they are serving their summer slop nonetheless.  And their bland bland, INSTITUTIONALLY bland House Special Chicken.  
Man, they make me miss Cali.  
Maybe it's because we (wife & I) always order take-out from them? 
(maybe it's...personal? I did complain about a dish two years ago...but not nearly as loudly as now)
I give up. 
They suck.
And don't even think of trying them out of season."}
{"text":"We went to big buddha for lunch today and a loved it.  I had the Mongolian chicken and it was fantastic. I've had their shrimp chow mein and their Hong Kong noodles and I really liked them both.  Also, I'm addicted to their crab puffs and my wife loves their chicken fried rice.  This place is definitely worth checking out and the lunch process are very reasonable if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 tries...one for take out and one for sit down. Both times a big disappointment. Except for the soups which tasted good,  my dishes seemed overcooked and not fresh. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Their egg rolls are not like NY egg rolls but everything I've ever had here has been fantastic! I had take out and dined in several times. My daughter just absolutely loves Uncle as he spoils her with a ton of fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've EVER had! Before we found this place we ate at Panda Express and this place makes that look like mcdonalds. The food is made fresh to order so it's not sitting out getting old and the flavor is so great. I was a little sketchy because looking at the picture the orange chicken didn't look like \"normal\" orange chicken. Oh boy it was the best orange chicken I've ever had. Every chance we get we order out and dine in. The customer service is also amazing which is hard to come by now a days."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  I have been here many times and am always impressed with the service and food.  Their patio is \"dog friendly\" which is important to me.  I recommend the fish dishes and the fried rice.  Also the hot and sour soup is the perfect food for a cold day.  The staff here is helpful and friendly and very professional."}
{"text":"Employees are always kind, but a little...blunt. They definitely made me feel embarrassed and awkward when I tried to order, pointing out how much food it was and laughing about it, not in a joking way either. Took off a star for that as that is unacceptable. The food is usually great! I love the sizzling rice soup. My partner usually gets the beef chow fun, but last time it was drenched in sauce which made it way too salty and we had to throw most of it out. It was one mistake though and the food has otherwise been consistent so we'll keep coming back. Definitely the best Chinese in surprise!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, VERY reasonably priced, hot and served quickly. And the service is as good as it gets 100 percent satisfied 10 out of 10!! Thanks Tuck King for your excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese but I've had better. We just moved from an area with a lot of options for Chinese and have been disappointed here. Compared to some others it's definitely better, and we'll probably order again because we live around the corner"}
{"text":"Big Buddha is awesome Chinese food.  The Chicken Mongolian is excellent.  The tofu is really good too.  We've been going here for years now - and they always provide good, reliable service.  We've tried a few Chinese places in Surprise, but this one really is the best."}
{"text":"Yum!  This is my favorite place to go to for Chinese food.  Their lunch menu is perfect.  Portions are the right size for the price.  The Hot and Sour soup is wonderful but my favorite dish is the Singapore Rice Noodles. Eat in or get it to go, the food is good no matter where you eat it. 
They have a nice place.  Eat inside or out on their spacious patio. 
Easy to get to.  Right off the 303 at Greenway."}
{"text":"Everytime I get their food I am completely satisfied. Typically we get carry out but the last time we went we dined in. My 2 year old daughter was acting a fool! She was the definition of insanity. One of the workers, possibly a manager, came up and started talking to her and joking around. She started behaving. He then rewarded her with a fortune cookie. Made her night. Everytime he came near the table she smiled and he would talk to her and joke around with her and us. It was a great experience.  Never had a bad experience with them whether it was delivery, take out, or dining. Big Buddha is the only Chinese food I eat in the west valley!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place with huge portions. Found it by accident very very happy with the service and food. Very friendly atmosphere and loved the how attentive they are. Never asked for a refill and never went dry. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food restaurant. Have had 7 or 8 different things from here and they all taste good. Large portions as well. Nothing has stood out though. If you have eaten at any other Chinese food restaurant you know exactly what you are getting."}
{"text":"Good food, very friendly, fast service, kid friendly. Had a wonderful experience and my children and I will be coming back. Good selection on the lunch menu and pleased with the prices."}
{"text":"I like this place.. I'm not wild about Chinese food but this was really good! I think we will be getting take-out from here more often!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while now and finally had the time to give it a try today! My mom, my son, and I went here for lunch after an outing and we weren't disappointed! 

It was very busy being that it was a Saturday and around lunch time. Luckily we only waited maybe 2 minutes to be seated. There was extra seating on the outside patio, but we wanted to sit inside due to having a toddler with us. The menu is very easy to read and not confusing at all. My mom ordered the chicken egg foo young, I got the sesame chicken, and my son got the teriyaki chicken off the \"Little Buddha\" menu. 

Everything was very good! The entrees, egg drop soup, egg roll, and crab puff were all delicious. The fried rice was just alright and nothing special, but that didn't bother me considering everything else was so tasty. 

The only issue I had was they accidentally brought me sweet and sour chicken. I mentioned that I ordered the sesame chicken and they corrected the error right away. Considering how busy they were, I understand that sometimes mistakes happen. They were very nice and quick to give me the actual dish I ordered so I don't feel the need to remove a star from my rating. 

All in all, very delicious, large portions (everyone had leftovers), and great lunch prices. Staff was great and attentive. We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Rice tasted like lightly sesoned minute rice. Egg rolls...don't recommend them, even if there free. Mongolian Beef was ok, nothing spectacular. I've had scrumptious mb before & this definitely wasn't it. Disappointed :'("}
{"text":"Best place around for sweet and sour chicken! The kids meals rock as they come with fried rice, a choice of meat and beef skewers. Did I mention their only 5-6 bucks? Little outdoor seating patio. The only thing we've found on the menu none of my family likes it the egg rolls.  Good prices and food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Haven't had a bad meal in or with carried out.  Been going to Big Buddha 16572 W Greenway Rd for years.  If you have a light appetite you can take the left overs home and enjoy the meal again.  Some dish's taste better as leftovers.  YUMM"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Chinese food is as good as it comes, at a reasonable price, and the servers and the owner are always personable and very customer service oriented. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went back last week for the first time in a while, and the service was very good. The water was attentive even though there were several other tables, and a few to-go orders came in. We got all the dishes we asked for. The food was delicious as I remembered it was before our last bad experience. This is the best Chinese food in Surprise by far. This last visit Big Buddha redeemed itself with the improved service, so we will continue going whenever we get a craving for Chinese in Surprise."}
{"text":"Big Buddha has been a go to for us for years now since we are so far away from decent Asian food all the way out here in Surprise. Our favorite seems to be the soups in the winter, something about sizzling rice soup while chilling on the patio under a heater with friends really makes the place great. 
I gave them five stars but I will say they act like extra napkins will force them to file chapter 11. Word to the staff, if I ask for extra napkins and there are 8 people at the table then please do not come with 3 additional napkins when you clearly see all the current ones are used."}
{"text":"I love their food especially the egg plant, lo-mein, and fried rice.would eat here anytime. Service is good too. Atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"I love Big Buddha! They have great lunch specials and the food is always fresh. They're Kung Pao is my favorite. Check this place out if you're in Surprise."}
{"text":"Very bad Chinese....

Me and my wife took a chance and went here last night. I read the mixed reviews, and thought that the good should out-weigh the bad, not in this case the food was horrible. We ordered for starters..egg drop soup...soup was bland and lacking flavor.
Next I order Happy Family, my wife orders Mongolian Beef, we were excited to try this place as it is close to our house. 
Well, we were very disappointed, the Mongolian Beef tasted like imitation meat, with a spice sauce that just wasn't right. Then we get the Happy Family and it tastes like imitation meat also, it was very hard not just to leave the restaurant, the only thing that was halfway cooked right was the white rice. 
With that said, the portions they give are small, and they charge too much for the product --even though the product is horrible. I wouldn't even feed this food to my dog..that's how bad it was. When we went to pay our bill the server noticed that we left quite a bit of food on the table, they asked if we would like to take it home, we both said \"No\" This place was a waste of time and money!

We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in surprise and very friendly environment."}
{"text":"I think this might be an ok chinese place, but   Their Kung pao chicken sauce was weird.  Since that is my favorite dish So i did not return after initial visit.  Also the chicken was not tender. I am going to give them another chance before I write them off."}
{"text":"While not my favorite Chinese restaurant ever, it's the best I've had in Surprise by far.  All your favorites will delight and for those that hate tofu (me included) you have to try the fried tofu app.  It's freakishly amazing (did I mention I hate tofu?).  My whole family enjoys our evenings out at Big Buddha!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese around hands down!! Love this place and we get take out on a regular basis! Try the sizzling rice soup!"}
{"text":"I don't come here very often and when I do, it's takeout. This time we sat down. I'm not sure how there could be a difference but the food tasted excellent tonight vs takeout! The sweet and sour combo (chicken, pork, and shrimp) was fantastic, especially the shrimp. We also had the pot stickers double pan fried for an extra crisp...yum. The egg rolls were crisp and flaky and were wonderful. I definitely left satisfied."}
{"text":"Great Chinese place, reminds me of being back on the east coast. Everything came out fast, and it was delicious. The pupu platter was fantastic, and the orange chicken was so crispy! I will always try to stop by when I'm in Surprise."}
{"text":"Oops.... I really should have gone to Big Heng. Seriously, why do I try new things?!?!?

I got the Hong Kong Crispy Noodle, consisting of a light, crispy fried noodle, (read that as tough and not easy to eat), topped with seasoned chicken with vegetables in a light sauce, (bland chicken and mushy veggies drenched in oily water), with an egg roll on the side, (a little stick filled mostly with shredded carrots and chopped onions). Yeah.... no. 

My wife got the sesame chicken, (tasty, but slippery, and with very little texture, not even slightly crispy), and side of lo mein, ($7.25 for a little box of noodles!!), and both were better than what I ordered. 

I was expecting a much different meal than what I got. 

I won't rule out trying Big Buddha, again, but...."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Called to order takeout and the man that placed me on hold for 11 minutes was rude and said he was too busy to take my order and hung up on me. I will gladly take my $100 order somewhere else."}
{"text":"had lunch there today. great small restaurant with good service. very much a family run business. nice friendly staff.

the food: very good !! good portions. well prpared and full of flavor. also, very good quality product served. good selection and very fair prices.
check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Absolutely has the best food! We are never disappointed whenever we go!!! Our favorite are the Singapore rice noodles! The staff is always so friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Everything was really good, maybe some of the best Chinese food I've had in a really long time. Coming from California everything out there is thai food. That's great but when you want really yummy chinese food it's just not the same. This place is my new favorite. You can tell they really care about putting out good food. Even the egg rolls are delicious. I say \"even the egg roll\" but so many restaurants just buy the cheapest frozen egg rolls and don't care. These are really good and shows making their customers happy means something to them. I love that and will be back to try everything on the menu.  Orange Peel chicken was awesome but I could not stop eating it until I hurt myself. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service what seemed to be the owner took time on a busy Friday night to come and pat us on the back and joked about letting us nap in a booth from being full. very good food had the orange peel chicken and garlic chicken very good! We are New to the area and will come back!"}
{"text":"A family Chinese staple in the surprise area will not go anywhere else this place is top notch and very clean"}
{"text":"A small Chinese restaurant located by SR 303 in Surprise. The side patio is covered and great to place to eat. My order was quickly delivered. I ordered house fried rice, beef chow fun (flat noodles), hot and sour soup. The food items are overwhelming of taste of onions, ginger and garlic. If you are used to this type of taste. It's a good restaurant to try."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese hands down!! The next best thing to East Coast Chinese!! I honestly wouldn't get Chinese anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for lunch and Big Buddha did not disappoint. My husband ordered the Singapore rice noodles and I ordered the beef chow fun. Both of them were hot and delicious! They weren't skimpy on portions and the noodle to vegetable ratio was great ( most of the time you get way more vegetables than noodles). The beef was also delicious and substantial. His Singapore rice noodle dish was great tasting as well and had plenty of meat. We received two free egg rolls for checking in and I wish I would have ordered more! They were fantastic! We will be back to big Buddha for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, the food and the portions were awesome. The best we've had in some time. We are new to Surprise so we are trying different places . So far we have 2 for 2 . The only bad part was I'm in a wheelchair and just trying to get in side the door was a disaster. Once we were in , no place to wait only three chairs to sit in and people eating wall to wall . It was packed. Since we had not been there before and had no idea the front door area was so small I felt like we were a big disruption. The food was all freshly prepared and soo good . Just know it's going to be busy . Next time we'll stay outside while we wait for a table . We have carried out since and it was awesome too ."}
{"text":"I love the crispy soft tofu and the sweet and sour tofu. It's good food for a good price."}
{"text":"We just moved here from San Antonio, not exactly the Chinese food mecca, but we were looking for our fix out here in the desert.  Not only did we enjoy the food, we were very pleased with the service.  The family that runs the restaurant went above and beyond to make my large family feel at home.  The food came in large portions and was better than we expected.  We have stopped looking for another Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"It's another Chinese place in another strip-mall.  Has lunch specials which are decently priced, but they aren't anything special.  Not too many indoor tables so you may end up outside.  I recommend the Chinese buffet at Bell & Litchfield as a good alternative.  Plus it's all you can eat."}
{"text":"Moved to Sun City West from Chicago, the heaven of food. Took me 6 months to find a Chinese restaurant comparable to the ones in Chicago. I FINALLY FOUND IT!!!! If you love Chicago's Chinatown, this is the place to go. Portion size is hugh and service is great."}
{"text":"Great Asian food at a reasonable price.  Outdoor seating in late spring. Yummy specials and traditional fare."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are so friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty! We always order take out because it is a smaller place, and we have 3 young children. However, the one time I tried to take them in, and the toddler was fussy, they were so nice and even tried making him happy by playing and giving him extra cookies. LOL. My personal favorites are the pork lo mein, sesame chicken and the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food s alright, customer service was pretty good although everyone who worked there was very hard to understand. Honestly though I wasn't too impressed with the food. The chicken was way over cooked and I wish they offered more of a variety with the main meals. All I had was orange chicken and rice. Could of used some vegetables included in the price. I won't be back. Panda Express is better!"}
{"text":"The eggrolls that come with lunch are so good. Sometimes very busy inside but have never have a problem with takeout."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Los Angeles CA I am certainly used to exquisite take out spots. Having spent the past 14 months living in Surprise I have yet to find a place I would return to, regarding any type of cuisine. I was certainly happily surprised when I ordered from Big Buddha and enjoyed the best take out I've had since moving to Surprise!

I ordered to pick up and when I went in to get my food the place was packed from wall to wall. I saw at least 3 party's be told that they are full and I sure was glad I ordered take out!! 

Food was extremely full of flavor, everything was cooked perfectly, the sweet and sour pork was extremely crispy with the sauce on the side so it didn't get soggy. Genius! Poo poo platter was alright but appetizers were kinda lacking, not bad but I wouldn't get them again. 

Overall prices are excellent and quality is definitely above average."}
{"text":"We found this place a month ago and have been back four times! The orange chicken is delicious and made in-house nothing deep-fried out of a bag.   The chicken egg foo yong is my favorite and has a garlicky brown gravy that's super flavorful! The staff is very friendly and I think the lunch prices are great. Crab puffs, fried rice and eggroll are included with the lunch special!  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"The place is small and cozy. The staff extremely friendly. The food was great will definitely be back . Rest job folks.."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now."}
{"text":"It's OKAY!!!! And this is it! Not great, or amazing, just OK! The fact that this place is so busy just tells you more about the lack of good Chinese Food in Surprise than anything else... 
They are also busy because they are only so-so at handling a lot of customers.... Iff you're in surprise and looking for Cho Fo
this is the best place by far... but remember it's Chinese food in Surprise..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this little gem.  I had the curry tofu and my partner had the orange tofu... we finally stepped outside our box. (I usually will order something like the moo goo gai pan at restaurants like this)

We are glad we stepped out of the box because it was excellent.  The orange tofu had an excellent glaze and still kept it's nice softness on the inside.  Same with the curry. The curry was nice and spicy, just like it's supposed to be and doesn't kill you with the spice.

We didn't have an issue with the rice like other reviewers did... not special, but not bad either.

The staff were real nice.

There was a steady flow of people moving in and out of the place, even at 1pm.

It was quick, easy, cheap and tasty.  Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is our go to Chinese restaurant.  The food is so fresh and tasty.  We come here once a week and usually get four things.  For $30, we get dinner there and pack it up and get two more meals at home!  We are vegetarians who do eat fish occasionally and they accommodate us and even make suggestions.  The Kung Pao fish fillet is superb as is the vegetarian soup and lo mein.  If I had anything that they could fix it would be to add two tea bags to the pot of tea to make it stronger and give a bigger amount of the crunchy noodles with the soup.  Other than that, this place is a real great addition to the west valley."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful visit. The staff is friendly and quick to refill drinks. The food is delicious. Whenever we order take-out, it's always ready before we get there. Big Buddha always exceeds my expectations. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, easy on the salt and packed with goodness. Try the beef chow fun. The place was very crowded but service was fast and friendly, big plus! The flounder in black bean sauce is delicious! Drizzle the sauce on steamed rice, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are at a great price and there is a variety of dishes to choose from. In addition, these dishes are a pretty large porportion. The customer service was awful! I had to ask for silverware twice as there were only 2 sets on the table. Not once did the server check on us after serving our food. I ordered the shrimp with vegetables. I give this dish a 1 star. It had an odd flavor. I am guessing the shrimp may have not been very fresh. The kids had the lunch specials which they enjoyed."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, hot and delish!  Whenever there is a question on NextDoor asking for the best Chinese in town Big Buddha comes up as the one named most often.  So tonight we have it a try with some friends from out of town.  We each tried something different for dinner and also had two appetizers.  Everything was very good.   

The staff were very friendly and engaging when refilling tea and water.  

We saw a lot of carry out orders and when we left at 6pm the place was packed - no open tables. 

The only thing we will ask next time is for no added salt.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was alright.  The staff was really friendly and the food was piping hot.  I wasn't really a fan of the sesame chicken though.  It almost tasted like thick honey with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I couldn't taste the sesame at all. Unfortunately it was a no go for me."}
{"text":"The food was great! We had the sweet and sour chicken, chicken teriyaki, curry shrimp, all of which we very scrumptious! The service was outstanding! Both gentleman we super sweet and helpful! Our drinks were never empty and our children we treated as well as we were! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some chinese food near me and this place popped up.  The reviews were good so we tried it out.  It's a small place, the young girl in the front wad not very courteous and didn't communicate well with us at all.  We were left standing there in the cramped entry assuming we would be seated our addressed at some point.  When we were finally seated the window we were seated up against was speckled with fly droppings and flies. The silverware was disgustingly dirty as were the glasses when we finally got our drinks.  We waited around for ages after giving or order to the server.  Many tables around us were getting orders and they were pushing out ToGo orders life crazy.  I finally got up and told them we didn't want our order anymore and we left.  No apologies, nothing. I don't know if the food is any good, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing. Been coming here for years now and the consistent quality is amazing. Try the twice cooked BBQ pork!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends from work. We were looking for a spot where we could get a quick bite to eat but NOT fast food. 

It's a small place but has a surprising amount of seating. It was busy but we were seated right away and drinks were brought over pretty quickly. The place was clean and The staff was busy busy, but quick. 

The menu had typical Chinese foods available. There was also a lunch specials page that was very well priced
For what you get (entree, fried or white rice, small soup, crab puff and egg roll)- about $6.50-$7). 

The soups were brought out first and were nice and hot. I had the sweet and sour soup and it was tangy, not overly salty and had a good amount of veggies in it. Next came the egg rolls and crab puffs. I'm not normally a big fan of these but had a bit of the puff and it was ok. The chop suey was very tasty! It was a surprisingly generous portion and was very savory and well seasoned without being over salty. My friend had the lo mein, which looked delish and the orange chicken, which I'm not usually into but smelled really good. She really liked her dish as well. 

They also honored 2 free egg rolls with a checkin! 

I'd return and encourage y'all to give it a try if you're on the area."}
{"text":"Checked in with yelp and you get 2 free egg rolls. All of our dishes were hot and very good. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, nice establishment. It is my go to for Chinese cuisine!!! Go there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We got take out last night. The service was good, our order was ready on time, there was plenty of parking, but the place is pretty small and there were quite a few people getting take out.
Everything we ordered from the menu was bland. The problem is all but one dish we ordered has a chili pepper next to it, suggesting a spicy dish. The House Lo-Mein was by far our favorite dish out of the group. We also ordered Hunan Beef, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Boiled Wonton and Garlic Chicken."}
{"text":"Awful. Refused to substitute a vegetarian soup for a meat-based soup in my lunch/special combo meal. Wouldn't give me a veggie egg roll instead of a pork egg roll. Wouldn't bring me veggie fried rice instead of meat. Even when I offered to pay extra for substitutions, our waitress refused. (Incidentally, their menu does not specify no substitutions, and when a table behind us wanted to change their soup out for a vegetarian soup, THEIR waitress was like, \"Sure!\", while I got the stink-eye). 

When I gave up my hope of getting to taste a little bit of everything with a lunch combo and settled on a vegetarian dish, they told me that the white wine sauce they use for their vegetarian dishes has chicken stock in it. I've been a vegetarian since I was 12. I'm not demanding. I've eaten corn on the cob in fancy steak restaurants and a bun with tomato at burger restaurants. I don't stomp my feet or demand special treatment, and I've NEVER had this kind of blow-back from a restaurant. I was there as part of a big group, and ended up eating white rice for lunch. I just can't recommend a restaurant that won't try to accommodate the dietary needs of their customers. If they gave a vegetarian this much trouble, heaven help you if you're celiac or have food allergies. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"This place never fails to delight. I've been eating here more or less since they opened. My favourites are the tomato beef (probably not everyone's cup of tea as it's a little slimy I guess), garlic eggplant/tofu, and either the Singapore or the Yang Chow fried rice. I've heard that the Orange Chicken is awesome, I'm not a big fan of this dish so I've never had it here, but at some stage I'll see if I can convince the wife to get some then try a small bit to see what the fuss is about. The only thing keeping this place from getting four stars is that it's a little on the pricy side - I bought an order of their (new) Taiwanese style beef and an order of Yang Chow rice, and the total came to almost $20. Entrees come with a small side of boiled rice, probably about 20c worth in the scheme of things. I'd have felt far more comfortable paying about $10-12, and in fact your dollar buys you plenty more food at Chen and Wok down the road, which is almost as tasty (and THEY have pork w/black mushroom! :-) At any rate, Buddha is a great little Chinese place in Surprise, clean, well-run, great selection of food but something that unfortunately I have to consider a rare treat based on cost."}
{"text":"We were out here for a meeting and didn't know the area. Looked on Yelp and found that this place was across the freeway a short distance away. So we trekked on over. It's what women would call \"cute\", the interior that is. It's small, but clean. We seated ourselves and we're immediately asked what we would like to drink and handed us menus. I had the lo mein with pork. In a nutshell, it as YUMMY.  I came up for air twice. You just got to try it out for your self."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food- never a disappointment! I am honestly addiscted to the War Wonton Soup. I cant get enough of it. Also they have great lunch specials. The staff is very nice too :)"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of pro's and con's about this place I thought I would give it a try.  

This is the off season for restaurants in Surprise, the snow birds are gone so I wasn't surprised to see that the place was empty went we arrived.  I had the Mongolian Beef which was pretty much flavorless and the wife had the Lemon Chicken that was actually pretty good.  

The service as good and the place was clean but honestly I was a bit let down by the bland food.  Mongolian beef should have been a bit spicy but like I said, it was unremarkable.  Portions were OK, we did have enough left over to bring home.  

Would I go back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"While the food was very fresh (even with ordering 20 minutes before closing) it tasted watered down. I don't know if it had to do with the fact that I ordered so close to closing but still would have liked my teriyaki chicken it taste like teriyaki. I will give this place another chance and and edit my review if I see if."}
{"text":"I've lived out in the west Valley for about 5 years now and I'm yet to come across a Chinese Food place better than this one.  This place has a local feel to it and is very clean and well taken care of. The staff are very friendly and willing to make substitutions to meet customer needs. The food is spectacular sit-down style. This place also has some classic dishes that you can't find anywhere else around town. The crispy orange beef and chicken sizzling rice dishes are among the best. This place is truly a gem of the west valley hidden in the north-west corner of Surprise."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see that this place has an average of 4 stars!! This place sucked. We ordered the crab puffs, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and egg drop soup. Everything was gross. The crab puffs were soggy and burnt, the sweet and sour chicken was somewhat decent but the sauce was sooo watered down. The fried rice was so greasy and had a weird flavor, and the egg drop soup was by far the worst. It tasted like someone used leftover water from cleaning dishes to make it. It was so nasty. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT reccommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! I have tried a lot of places here in surprise and none of them compare to the quality of food you get from Big Buddha. I ordered through Door Dash. The food was so fresh it was ridiculous! The egg rolls had fresh ingredients inside.... not some processed frozen junk like almost all other places around here. All of the food was delicious! We will never go anywhere else again! Do it! Order from this place! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"9/10 times it's great. There have been two times where the Mongolian beef tastes weird. Sesame chicken is always delish and the crab puffs too."}
{"text":"We love Big Buddha! Best Chinese food in Surprise. The Taiwanese Beef will change your life."}
{"text":"Such great customer service and delish food!! Support your locals!! We had a big group and about 7-8 plates and they were ALL good  def coming back."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was so good and free egg rolls? Yes please! Totally different than the other guys! Looking for a nice local sit down Asian spot, look no further!!"}
{"text":"Over priced. Small sized. Never thought of ordering organge chicken without onions. Which was a piece of chicken cut up. beef and broccoli was horrible. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very friendly, personable service, delicious food, nice atmosphere, descent prices, lunch specials 7 days a week. I chose Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is chicken with vegetables, served with a cup of soup, a cream cheese filled wonton, and an egg roll - all very good. Hot tea is only 50 cents. We are California transplants and have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant for our Sunday-after-church-lunch. Big Buddha is the best of the choices and we will continue to frequent here. Would love to see \"General Chicken\" or their equivalent on the lunch special."}
{"text":"I'm super picky about my Chinese food and this is some of the best I've ever had. They are alway extremely nice to my family as well, with a kids menu perfect for your little ones"}
{"text":"great food, reasonable, and fast service.  good size portions"}
{"text":"Big Buddha it's always amazing! I have eaten in, taken out, and it's always quite good.

Over time, I have not noticed a changed in quality either way. It's just extremely tasty food and my number one choice for Chinese if you're in the Surprise area. A nice little Surprise I recently noticed is that they still gave us soup with our takeout, on top of the eggrolls and fried wontons which I wasn't even aware was part of the lunch special. Plenty of food, excellent price and quality.

Do yourself a favor and go, I can't imagine you will have anything but a great experience."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place. So hard to find good chinese food, we lived in Avondale for 8 years and LOVED Wongs. Finally found a place in Surprise that is actually BETTER. Food is fresh and very tasty. We order from them probably once a month, love it. Crab puffs are to die for. I dont like the egg drop soup, tastes like \"dirty\" water, not sure what it is I dont like, if its a seasoning or what, but, my boys and hubby like it so, who knows. They have a nice indoor ambience and an outdoor patio. You will not be disappointed in Big Buddha. I tell EVERYONE I know who lives out here about it. Great place."}
{"text":"Look, I'm Chinese and although this isn't an authentic Chinese restaurant, it is still verrrrry good. The orange chicken is out of this world. It is a full breaded chicken breast with their amazing sauce. I eat here at least twice a month. This place is a bit small but the food os always fresh and hot. Their lunch specials are inexpensive and comes with a ton of food. My favorite dude is the older asian guy who always brings his A game."}
{"text":"First ever dining experience last night. Their Wanton soup was terrific.  The kids loved their chicken chow mien.  It was surprisingly very good. We will be coming back again to get take out."}
{"text":"Love this place!!    Got called out on my Yelping by my GF's son. He asked if I had posted any positive reviews.  Well here come a few.

We have been to this restaurant 3 times. Funny, because we have been treated like long time regulars since the first time. The House Crispy Chicken and all the other dishes we've tried were fantastic! The service is also amazing as it seemed, especially last night, that we had 3 servers all taking good care of us, with smiles ...even when our added on Crispy Tofu was forgotten till we were into our meals was brought out with apologies and we were told it would be taken off our bill and they were sorry!! WOW!!!...Oh, and we needed a bit more rice. Brought out in a flash, no extra charge Can't wait to go back! These are the kind of places I love to support...gonna go for lunch too, great deals!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoy stopping by at lunch, friendly staff, good eats.   I love the mango tea they make!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Big Buddha last Sunday for some lunch.  I was pleased to  see that they offer the regular lunch menu on Sundays.  I ordered the Chicken Egg Foo Young which came with hot 'n sour soup, egg roll, crab puff and fried rice.  The main Egg Foo Young was done in a sort of Tempura batter which worked well with the tasty gravy sauce.   Very nice family owned business.  It is a smaller store front restaurant and got crowded pretty quickly so come early.  Friendly service, tasty food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Surprise, awesome staff and fast carry out service, if you love Asian food check out Big Buddha!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  We ordered the beef chow fun, mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, and the teriyaki chicken.  We also brought in a coupon for free cream cheese crab won tons.  I didn't care much for the mongolian beef, but there was nothing bad about it, really.  My husband loved his beef chow fun.  I think I will probably try all new items next time.  The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though and I loved the cream cheese crab won tons.  The price was right and service was good too."}
{"text":"Big Buddha is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants to order to go. And let me tell you, I'm picky about that kind of stuff. I just lived in OH FOR 3.5 months and the Chinese food I ordered to go from.. yeah I'm not that impressed with. I know for a fact someone found hair in their food from one of the places. But this place, is amazing. They're pretty quick. It's a decent size inside and I LOVE their crab ragoons. Literally to die for. It's been months since I've been home so I don't remember what it was that I got from here but I will have to go here again and try something and get my crab ragoons. I look forward to coming back and trying it!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible!! The food was so bad and they forgot my food and acted like I was lying when I told them. 
After eating a few bites I couldn't take it and within minutes was sick. Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Never actually ate at the location. We have had take out on a couple of occasions. Really good food, have had their orange chicken, chow mein, Mongolian beef. Seems to be the best locally. I could only think of a couple of places that are better, but they are California!! This will be our Chinese food joint, until they fail us!!! Service has always been good, and price are decent!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Nice evening on the patio. Service was great,  food was great
 I had the Taiwanese Beef, the wife had the Cashew & Almond chicken. Both were great.  We will come back here."}
{"text":"I'm a little conflicted about this place.  I've dined here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch.  

Dinner was quite good.  We ordered three a la carte dishes...Szechwan string beans with shrimp and tofu, eggplant with sliced pork, and garlic chicken.  We also had some free egg rolls as part of a Yelp check-in offer.  All of the dishes were flavorful, well portioned, and came out piping hot.

On our second visit, we came during lunch time but debated on whether we should just stick to the a la carte items or try their lunch specials.  Since the lunch prices are quite cheap, we decided to try the lunch specials.  Mistake.  I had the curry tofu with vegetables lunch special which also came with fried rice, an egg roll, a crab puff, and hot and sour soup.  The meal was very bland.  The fried rice is basically just steamed rice and soy sauce.  The food was disappointing considering how good our previous dinner had been.

If I dine here again, I will stick to ordering dishes similar to what I ordered the first visit."}
{"text":"We went an HOUR before they closed and we walked in the door and you can tell they didn't want to serve us. we were the only people there, and our server before even saying hi goes \"they are power washing the kitchen it's going to be about 20 minutes before you meal will even start to be cooked.\" we said okay and the server kinda rolled her eyes about it. it made me uncomfortable being a server you shouldn't advice them not to stay there. I even said \"we can get it to go if you need us to leave early.\" she said \"I'm stuck here with or without you guys\" so we ordered and I food came out in about 10 minutes so you knew it was a lie about the kitchen. the food was good. average Chinese food, the manager checked in on us. it was good decor and nice prices. I would go back in hopes on getting different service. that's all. I guess don't go in there and hour before closing lol"}
{"text":"Not good!  Service bad!  Food was cold!  They don't make extra spicy as they said it's not something the neighborhood requests?  I did and I was out of luck.  Save yourself some time and money and go to Panda Express it's a lot better."}
{"text":"Been back 3-4 times plus one takeout!  Everything has been excellent!  Certainly our go-to for Chinese food now."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight after hearing great things! Unfortunately we were highly disappointed. Ordered sesame chicken, pork fried rice, House special chicken, beef lo mein and crab puffs. The only thing I liked were the the crab puffs. Everything else was soggy and bland. Others in my family also liked the pork fried rice but I was not a fan. The beef lo mein had absolutely no flavor... we had to add salt & pepper. The breading on the chicken dishes was soggy and fell off leaving the over cooked, dry chicken remaining. We might give it another go after a few months but will definitely order other things."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is outstanding.  I live about twenty minutes away from Big Buddha and the food is worth the drive.  One of my fiancées favorite dishes is eggplant and it has been very difficult to find a restaurant that prepares that type of dish without making the eggplant soggy and he was very happy that one was found.  The Singapore Rice Noodles are amazing and I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Great food! Some of the best Chinese I have had. I recommend the sesame chicken which is my usual go to. Waiter was extremely helpful and answered questions and gave recommendations which turned out wonderful. Portions were not to much or too little, and priced right. Just moving to the area this will be our go to Chinese for dine in and take out for sure! - just a Yelp tip- if you have a Yelp promotion (example 2 free egg rolls with min purchase) let the waiter know ahead of ringing up your order, their system does not allow to take back off receipt for the promotion once entered in."}
{"text":"Your standard Chinese takeout, which is the furthest thing away from an insult. It's so hard to find good food in Surprise, let alone any food with a hint of culture. It's a good place and fast. You can get all of the Americanized Chinese food staples. Get the chicken Lo Mein and sesame chicken - so good."}
{"text":"Amazing. We loved it!!! Have been there three times now and could not enjoyed our selfies more. My whole family was happy. The sauces for the dishes are beyond words."}
{"text":"My wife and I rarely disagree this much about a restaurant. She hates it. I like it. Whats not to like? The egg rolls are horrible. The won ton soup is worse. And the lobster sauce is dark and salty. But... the chow fun (broad noodle) is NY Chinatown good. Just about everything I've tried on the menu in four visits has been tasty , the portions are very generous, the menu prices are low, low, low, the service is excellent and the staff is really nice. I could add another star because of how genuinely nice these folks are."}
{"text":"This is really good quality Chinese food. The meats are good quality and well prepared. The food is flavorful without being overly greasy. I've been here twice now - once for dine in and once for takeout and have liked the dishes a lot both times."}
{"text":"Food was ok at best. It was warm but not hot. The house fried rice was very bland and none of the meats were seasoned at all. For 8 dollars just for a plate of rice I could have done better at home. My boyfriend liked his Mongolian beef but my teriyaki chicken was very standard and nothing special. If you want better food and better prices go to golden Wei at bell and cotton"}
{"text":"Tried Big Buddha after a few suggestions from my neighbors and it was fantastic! We called in our food to-go.  Everything was just as we ordered and delicious.  The food was ready for us when we got there to pick it up and the employees were very friendly.  Cute restaurant! We will definitely make it a point to dine-in sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Basic run of the mill Chinese that seems to be geared for the Sun City crowd. Bland and ordinary on most dishes. Family Tofu, Sweet and Sour, Lemon Chicken, gloopy and way to much corn starch in the sauce. Just over all unimpressed. We did ask them to make Chow Fun with beef and green peppers which was very good but \"seasonal\".. WTF? Seasonal? It's noodles, beef and bell peppers.. what's so seasonal about that? 

If in a real pinch and are dying for some Chinese this is probably one of the better Chinese choices in Surprise. At least its not a chain or a buffet!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and it was awesome!   The service was fast( we had food with in less than 10 minutes of sitting down) and super friendly.  Portions were large and all three dishes we shared( orange beef, house lo mien, and almond cashew chicken) were very tasty especially the orange beef!  We are new to the area and now have found our Chinese go to place!"}
{"text":"Great chinese food and customer service. And affordable too! Best chinese restaurant in Surprise hands down."}
{"text":"Great location with outside seating and patio heaters. Service is outstanding, prices too. I had the Chicken Egg Foo Young which is honestly the best I've had. Piping hot and a huge portion, plenty of chicken as well. My Wife had the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and she always worries a little when she orders as some places say they use Chicken breast but we know better. This was all tender breast meat chicken and the sauce was perfect. As I mentioned the prices are low, too low, not sure how they stay in business. Excellent service too, very friendly employees. Very good Chinese"}
{"text":"The food is always great.  The staff is always friendly. Whether you in in or take away, this is one of the best places for dinner in Surprise."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!!  Excellent food/service...my favorite \"Singapore Rice Noodle\" or \"Kung Pao Delight\" the kids love the \"Orange Chicken\"
We've eaten there once a week for the last month or maybe more and the food & service has been great every time!  Awesome food for an extremely reasonable price!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to take home. Everything was yummy and the prices are very reasonable. The chicken special was my favorite."}
{"text":"It's so hard to get GREAT Chinese food, so I have to say Big Buddah is very good. 
I guess I wouldn't know GREAT Chinese food since I don't think I have ever said that when I ate it - but their food is always freshly made exactly how you order it and it's very yummy.
They use lots of veggies if you ask as much or as little sauce as you ask and spicy or not spicy. 
They are clean, extremely friendly - one of my fav places to go in my neighborhood. 
So fresh, hot and quality food....4 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best Chinese food we have had in Arizona. In fact it's as good an experience as Chicago's Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is a couple steps up from places like panda express, but I have had better. It's kind of a small, quaint sort of restaurant. Price is about as normal as any other Chinese food place."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying, I don't care for Chinese food. My fiancé loves it though. When he has a craving, I immediately go to Big Buddha. It's the only Chinese food I will eat in the area. I've tried several with no luck but I actually crave this place. Their crab Rangoon is perfectly cooked and flavored. The sesame chicken is never \"mystery meat\" like you get at other places, the orange beef is my favorite and their servings are huge. We usually order 2 dishes with rice and noodles. My family of 4, 2 adults, a 9 year old and 2 year old, can eat from just that and take left overs home. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Delicious and we love it. Best sweet and sour around. Wish the dining in area was a bit bigger because it was packed when we ate there. Close quarters. Love the food thou. And service is great! 10+"}
{"text":"I've only gotten take-outs from here but the food is pretty good. Especially their combination fried rice and chow mein."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating here. Can't think of any reasons to not give them a top rating. Place was clean and pretty busy, we were greeted by a pleasant and friendly hostess, seated quickly and brought menus and water immediately. Ordered Mongolian beef, hot and sour soup, and house lo mein. The soup was hot and tasty. Lots of beef in the Mongolian beef, way more than I've had at any other restaurant. The lo mein was also good, it had beef, chicken and several large shrimp. My husband is often not a fan of Chinese restaurants but said he'd gladly come back and urged me to write them a good review. We were checked on by a couple other workers to make sure everything was okay, I always appreciate that. Will enjoy the leftovers for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! I luckily  ran into this place. I live here in Surprise and there are closer places but not even close to this one as far as good food and five-star customer service. I have been here two times and both times the food was delicious. The people are so friendly. It just doesn't get better. I recommend the Kao Pao chicken steak shrimp plate, the Po Po sampler platter, and the spicy wonton soup.. but everything else looks so delicious."}
{"text":"Went there on the advice of a friend.
What a mistake and a waste of money.
Save your time and money, go to Panda Express instead. At least their food taste better."}
{"text":"Very good food. Extremely large portions and plenty to go around. The restaurant is very clean. Very friendly staff. Chen Wok on Waddell and Litchfield certainly has a formidable competitor in Surprise."}
{"text":"Just moved to surprise and I was happy to find a local Chinese restaurant and Big Buddha was great! We loved everything!
Although it'd be great if they stepped up their potsticker/egg rolls game ;)"}
{"text":"First time we have eaten there. Everyone was very friendly. Orange chicken was the best. Sweet and sour chicken not as good, not crispy and sauce was not thick, kinda watery."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken, wonton soup and kung pao I've ever had. A bold statement, I know. I stand behind my words. Service is consistently good; Attentive and friendly servers. Atmosphere could use a bit more ambience. Overall, excellent food at a reasonable price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend found this place by accident one day. The location is a bit tucked away but it is some of the best Chinese/Asian cuisine food I've had in the west valley. The prices are affordable but the food is where this place gets you. I've only visited twice but we have not yet been disappointed by the items we've gone with. Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place has grown on me, its good. True, I really miss the amazing chinese places I use to have in Utah (weird, but some of the best). It is good to have a decent place close to home, who is nice and fast :).  The hubby has become an orange chicken fan, no longer sweet and sour. I like the orange best also, the house (tso) is good, but not as tasty as the orange.  The egg rolls are super yummy :) egg drop soup good... I am glad they are close to us :)..."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here but it's been almost 10 years since I was out in surprise. I came for lunch and it was amazing. I had the orange tofu lunch and the boiled wonton soup large. It was so good I ordered another large to take home since I don't live anywhere near this amazing little gem.  The foods a tad salty so don't add soy but other then that the foods fantastic.  Now the customer service is equally great. I was greeted pleasantly and the owner even came out to help and assist with food.  Just all around great place."}
{"text":"After being stuck in Hawaii for 3 1/2 long years, I needed to find a Chinese restaurant (not many good ones out in paradise).  This place hit the spot; attentive waiters, ample menu, and quaint spot.  But the punch line was the outstanding food.  You know that feeling when your stomach tells your brain you should probably stop?  Yeah well the deliciousness of this food scrambles that signal.  I was so full but oh so content!  If i ever roll through these parts again, I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times staff is friendly and the owner is awesome, he's very interactive with his customers make you feel like your at home"}
{"text":"Love this place! Veggie lo mein is perfect for my vegetarian girlfriend. Their chicken lo mein and sweet and sour chicken are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Chinese food I've had in the Valley. Everything from the basic fried rice to the honey walnut shrimp are perfect."}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite place. :) They are very accommodating and the food is always perfectly cooked. The staff is like family! They are so sweet. I would recommend the egg rolls, crab puffs, chicken corn soup, and the Mongolian chicken. I also order the Mango Tea :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch with three ladies  each ordered something different.The food came out and it was excellent. Everybody was  Please with their choice of food.
service was great no better place to have a Chinese lunch at a very inexpensive price. And the  Portion was just enough not to little not too much. Just right!"}
{"text":"First time to this small Chinese restaurant and it was great. Best service, fresh vegetables not overcooked and lots of meat in the dishes I ordered. It came with about 4 cups of rice in a bowl with a lid which kept it warm. Great find."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in West Valley!  Great selections and portion sizes are just right!  I have never had a bad meal at Big Buddha.  The staff is very friendly to their loyal patrons.

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great food. Being Jewish and raised in NYC I am very familiar with Chinese American cuisine. The Big Buddha serves NYC style Chinese American. Great fried rice, Mongolian Beef (which you can ask the ginger be omitted) etc. However, their Egg Foo Yung reminded me of my grandmother's matzo balls. Egg Foo Yung is supposed to be light and fluffy with lots of sauce. The Big Buddha's chicken Egg Foo Yung is compact and very dry with little taste. That's the reason for 3stars and not more."}
{"text":"My kids love there sweet and sour chicken kids meals and I love the price! We eat here at least once every few months but if mu kids had their way it would be every week. Friendly, family service and great food and good prices."}
{"text":"Mediocre as far as Chinese restaurants go. They seemed to be having serving issues when we went. Our food (for 5 people) came out in 3 waves that spanned 15 minutes. I did enjoy the crispy honey chicken, which is an appetizer. But other than that nothing was worth noting. I would order to go when I craves some Chinese food but I won't be going back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC where greasy Chinese food is on every block and at your door within minutes, Big Buddha lies pretty low on my fast food scale.

I've only tried a handful of Chinese restaurants in Surprise and Big Buddha is by far my least favorite. I ordered the beef chow fun and garlic chicken on Saturday night and both were sub-par. 

The beef chow fun was not good. The noodles stuck together and the veggies didn't seem fresh. It also tasted like someone just dunk a ton of soy sauce over the flat noodles. It was not appetizing at all.

My beau ordered the garlic chicken and it was not spicy whatsoever even though I asked them to make it spicy. 

If you're looking for good Chinese food, I suggest Chen Wok. They're delicious and deliver!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food and vegetarian options! I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The best orange chicken I've had in Az! 
The red chili peppers are the secret :D 
But not to worry, the dish itself is not spicy (in my opinion). I would like it even more if it were, lol. 

Everything about this place is awesome; food, service, prices, location. 

When I ate at the location I liked the atmosphere, but the TVs threw me off a little, lol. Still, even with them, it still manages to be intimate and not in a bar sort of way. There is seating outside that looks nice, especially during this time of year. 

The people who work here are always very friendly & pleasant. 

When I've ordered take out they answer the phone quickly and have my food ready for me normally within 15 minutes! I don't tell them, but I can't even drive there that quickly, lol. 

Great service all around!"}
{"text":"Really just think this place is okay. Tried it twice because we lived around the corner. But not great."}
{"text":"When we first discovered Big Buddha we thought we hit Chinese food gold. It was at so many levels better than your typical greasy Chinese food take out. Move forward a few years and I don't know what happened.  Food really got bad. Orange chicken which is a thin sliced chicken breast was way over cooked. I mean dry and chewy. The sauce was so greasy. Leftovers Chinese food usually gets put away as leftovers which we will eat within a couple days. This time it all went into the garbage. 3 stars for what they use to be. Maybe we were there recently on a few off nights. But at $40-$50 per take out order it's just not worth taking the chance at wasting money."}
{"text":"Wow! This is by far the best Chinese food we have found in Surprise. We ordered pot stickers, crab puffs, house lo mein and the crispy orange beef. All were delicious! The meat they use here seems to be of much higher quality than the average Chinese food restaurant. The pot stickers were bursting with flavor. I only wish they delivered to the 115th and Bell area. No worries - I will continue to go there to pick it up. It's that good!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. Love the food and have always had pretty good service. Tonight was totally different. We got our soup and appetizers ok, however when we asked the waitress if there was crab in our crap puffs the waitress said no just cream cheese. That's not a crab puff. We waited and waited for the entrées, questioned the waitress a couple times and she kept telling us soon. All this time we were watching takeout orders steadily out of the kitchen. When a large group who came in after us and ordered after us got their food we were done. We told the waitress to get our bill for what we had actually received, paid and left. Even though we love the food, we'll think twice about going back. We did wait close to an hour after getting our appetizers before giving up"}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin with this place! I've been eating here since they've opened and can't say a single bad thing about my experience. All of the employees are friendly especially the owner and his wife! They always make me and my family feel extremely welcome.  I can count on getting my meal quickly for lunch while on a time schedule between work and school and even during dinner! I've had them cater several times for parties and ordered take out multiple times leaving me extremely happy as I do dining there. Lunch specials are too good to believe too! Don't forget to try their mango tea, sesame chicken, and beef chow fung if you decide to try it... Just order the whole menu its all soooo delicious I promise!! In fact I'll probably grab a bite to eat here today!"}
{"text":"Very clean, cozy and comforting establishment! Easy parking and plenty of it. Inside, the lighting and music created a very welcoming ambiance. I felt bad coming in so close to closing time, but the employees were more than welcoming! Especially Tuc! He greeted us with a smile as he presented us with the menu. Someone very close to me had recommended this place and it's orange chicken, so I had to try it... and my oh my was it the best orange chicken I've ever had! The chicken was moist with a crispy shell. The sauce was not tangy and overpowering, it was subtle and flavorful. You can literally eat it by itself without rice! We also ordered the Hong Kong style crispy noodles. Delicious.. the mixed texture of the noodles combined with the flavorful vegetables and chicken is a combination of greatness! An added bonus was the free egg rolls with a purchase of at least $15! Throughout the dining experience we were never rushed and Tuc was very considerate when he asked us if we wanted anything else before they close the kitchen. Overall great place to dine in. I feel more regular visits in the near future!

Thank you Tuc for your kindness and service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, funny waiter!  Really enjoyed and will remember to come here when we return next year!"}
{"text":"In my original post, I gave Big Buddha a low score due to a problem with an order. After posting in yelp, the owner personally reached out to me to address this issue. I was very impressed with the professionalism and his eagerness to accept feedback. 

I have to admit that Big Buddha is still my favorite Chinese food place in the West Vally!! That said, I have revised my rating.

{"text":"Came here for the first time today and was very impressed! A nice older gentleman came and took our order quickly. He was very attentive and friendly! We felt very welcome! The food was amazing. Chinese food can all taste very similar (same chicken for every dish but with a different sauce) but this food was extremely flavorful! We had lemon chicken and the meat was juicy, lemony, and breaded with such care and flavor. We also got the pork fried rice and again, it was amazing and full of flavor. Trust me when I tell you that you need to try this place! It's a gem and we will deffinatley be back with our family and friends!"}
{"text":"Okay, so we've been coming here for years, and I feel it's time to finally leave a review for Big Buddha.

Located right off the Loop 303 and Greenway in a small plaza, it's unlikely that you'd come across some really good Chinese food. 

When you first walk into Big Buddha, you'll notice that the place is rather compact. So my advice if you are claustrophobic, so warning when coming during their busy hours (i.e. dinner, weekends). They do have a patio, so when weather is permitting, dining outside is a great option. Especially since this plaza isn't necessarily busy and is also on the cusp of a housing neighborhood, so it's awesomely quiet.

Now, what we're all here for *drumroll*, the food! The portions can be on the smaller to medium size, but the taste makes up for it. There is great flavor without it being over powering. A favorite of ours here is the Twice Cooked Pork. And you must wash it down with their house mango tea. All-in-all, Big Buddha will always be worth the drive from the Not-as-west West Valley."}
{"text":"Called right at 3 pm to get $40 worth of lunch specials delivered to my home for a family of 5. Just moved to surprise and they said sorry, lunch special is over. What restaurants are that busy at 3 pm? Got my order taken by another spot down the road no problem."}
{"text":"My group ordered almost everything from the menu. Food tasted amazing and very generous portions! Will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"Big Buddha, great Chinese food! Reasonable prices and normal Americanized staples. I like how efficient they are for take out orders and the way they package their takeout items rocks (sealed almost tupperware containers!) Fast, and very reasonable prices. Mongolian Beef, Singapore style rice etc. So good. Very well done and tasty. I normally take out for dinner here, and sometimes stop by for a lunch special which is a real bargain. YUM."}
{"text":"this is a hidden treasure - we are in AZ for the holidays from Chicago and our dear friends told us about this wonderful restaurant.  We had the BEST Chinese food ever!!!! the service was great the food was outstanding - we will be making this OUR new Chinese food restaurant 
the owner came to our table and was so pleasant - its worth the wait - can be crowded but they accommodate everyone."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! Food exceedingly yummy albeit probably most likely not the most healthy. However, the Wanton soup is great as is the Walnut Shrimp and Pork Fried Rice. Just go crazy and try everything as it is super cheap."}
{"text":"Not bad. No veggie egg rolls though. Most of the non-seafood dishes have a slight fishy taste because the grill/wok/whatever is used to cook virtually everything."}
{"text":"We are new in town and after a busy day unpacking, we were in no condition to cook. We found Big Buddha nearby and went in for dinner. The owner greeted us and was very attentive. We were starving and over ordered, but that just allowed us to have some additional lunches. We ordered the Honey Walnut Prawns and were pleasantly surprised by the generous number of pr in the order. It was a tasty dish and did not make it home. We also had the Tomato Beef; a dish we had not seen before and gave it a try. It too was flavorful for dinner and subsequently for lunch. Our final dish was the beef chow fun. The wide rice noodles were tasty having absorbed the cooking juices. 

We returned a week later with our visiting sons. We order other dishes such as the almond cashew shrimp, beef with broccoli, chicken chow fun, and battered green beans. All were delicious and there were no leftovers."}
{"text":"Great Chinese in Surprise.  After two visits this has become our favorite place in Surprise for Chinese food.  All of the staff is attentive and way friendly.  The food is excellent and the portions are large enough to take some home.  We always get to entree's and split them.  Our last visit we split twice cook pork and chicken chop.  suey.  The fried riced was excellent and meats were succulent. The restaurant is a little small but they do have outdoor seating.  We have tried the \"buffets\" in the area and have found that Big Buddha is a good and well priced restaurant.  Leftovers at home are always a bonus.  We will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the Valley, not just Surprise.  I was on my way to another Chinese place when I pulled out my handy Yelp mobile App and the reviews all told me to come here.  Got dinner to go.  Order on the phone was taken fast and dinner was ready when we arrived in 15 minutes.  We got the Beef skewer appetizers and they were really good.  A little on the fatty side as far as beef goes but it had a lot of flavor.  For main dishes we got the Orange Chicken per everybody's reviews as well as the Beef Chow Fun.  Orange chicken was white meat breast.  The sauce was very good and didn't drown the food.  It was an excellent dish!!  Beef Chow Fun is great as it has delicious noodles and beef (the ultimate compromise in my home).  If I had to be picky, I'd say it is a little expensive (not overpriced because I am willing to pay an extra buck or two per dish for greatness) but over $30 for two dishes and an appetizer.  I will be back soon and often as long as they keep making great food."}
{"text":"Great food! Always busy~ we usually get there early or late enough so no waiting. But if you want take out suggest you call in your order. I like their orange chicken, egg foo young, and their special rice noodles"}
{"text":"We were so happy to find this little gem. This area has a lot of really bad Chinese restaurants. This one is great. Management and staff are friendly and genuinely hospitable. You feel like they want you to have a good experience. Portions are generous, beautifully plated and food is delicious. It's a clean, cozy place and very nice for a quiet dinner or a family meal out."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down the toilet in customer service.. We placed a phone order which the girl on the phone repeated back to me yet when we go there it was wrong. We asked for hot mustard they gave us 1 when I asked her for at least one more I was told I could only get the one.. We ordered multiple items and spent a good amount of money and they couldn't afford to give us 1 more got mustard!! That's pretty ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Po Po Platter to start...cannot go wrong.  The service is fast and they were always checking up on us.  Main dish was perfect, Chicken special and Mongolian beef.  Both were perfect.  Great local spot and I will most definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Although staff was uber friendly and service was fast, we found the total package lacking.  Stopped because of Yelp reviews and glad we found this venue at the right time and place; off the hwy.  It is a busy, sort of fast food, place.  Definitely a value.  Perhaps an overuse of soy and fried offerings, except the fried rice, which seemed steamed.  Clean; refreshing decor.  A good choice, but not a 4 star selection."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese spot in Surprise! My husband and I love their Kung Pao chicken and their vegetable lo mien. If you're going to want Chinese take out this is the place to do so! They're so quick with getting your order out and it's always fresh. They have incredible lunch deals too...you get soup,lunch entree,fried wonton and an egg roll typically under 6 bucks!"}
{"text":"Big Buddha gets my vote for best Chinese in Surprise.  Their food is always cooked fresh and delicious.  I stop in weekly and get my dose of Twice Cooked Pork for lunch.  $6.25 with eggroll and soup, such a deal.  I have tried most of the offerings and they are all good.  I like things spicy so I add some chili sauce to most of my entrees and heat it up to my liking.  Best way to do it really.  Can't blame someone for making it too hot.  The staff is great and they always greet me with a smile and know just what I want.  I'm retired and not in any hurry but the food comes out quick and hot and I love it.  No lukewarm buffet and no over eating.  Prices are great and the food is real quality.  It is always crowded but worth the wait.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"When I first visited with my family a couple of years ago, three of the dishes were delicious and one (Mongolian Beef) was so salty, I couldn't eat it. I've been hesitant to go back. But, since everyone in Surprise raves about it, I thought we could try it again. This time, we got carryout. The person who helped me at checkout was so friendly and sweet, and for the most part, the food was delicious! Again, it was my dish that was just okay (Chow Fun), but I highly recommend the lo mein and sesame chicken."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot! It's very hard to find a place that both kids like and that I like. We LOVE this place. The food is awesome, take out comes perfectly packed for travel..and the staff is very friendly. So friendly that they remember their customers names. A definite must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"THE BEST CHINESE ON THE WESTSIDE. I had the wonton soup, spicy eggplant with tofu, orange chicken, chicken lo mein and the honey chicken. I know, quite a bit was sampled. The orange chicken is in strips and is very fresh and crispy. The honey chicken is sweet and little nuggets, perfect for kids. The spicy eggplant is AMAZING. The owners of this restaurant are very friendly and kind. If you want authentic Chinese and live in the boonies, try this place out and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been here several time.  Excellent food and service.  Love it!  Orange chicken is so good."}
{"text":"I cannot wrap my head around the raving reviews for this place. I have had the best Chinese food, and I have had the worst. This is close to the worst I've ever had. It's not good food. Honestly, Panda Express is 10x better! The only thing that was kind of okay was their Wor Wonton soup. The people that wrote the raving reviews have obviously never tasted GOOD Chinese food. Keep searching, you can to better......I really miss China Cafe in Glendale."}
{"text":"I was pleased to find a Chinese restaurant in Surprise that uses gluten-free soy sauce. However, it costs $1 extra per dish for the few tablespoons they put into a dish. Plus, the chef was very rigid and wasn't able to do substitutions--such as no carrots, but please put in broccoli instead. I've never heard of a Chinese restaurant that didn't at least try to accommodate the customers. This shows very little imagination.

To his credit, the chef came to my table and told me that two out of the three dishes I wanted wouldn't be compatible with my allergies, so I'd have to order something else. I appreciated this--but WHY couldn't I get a simple meal, made the way I wanted? Because the sauces are PRE-MADE! Which means that a lot of the food isn't freshly prepared. So I ordered something else. And was I disappointed.

The onions in the shrimp chow fun weren't even cooked. They were basically raw, so the sharp taste of the onions overpowered the dish. This chef would have been axed on the TV show \"Chopped.\" If my two dining companions and I weren't so hungry, we would have left.

The other two diners, who don't have allergy restrictions, were disappointed. The orange chicken, one reported, was heavy and sweet. And it had zero vegetables. Not even a few spears of broccoli or sprouts or snow peas. Nada. I forget what was wrong with the other dish, but no one was happy. 

I am not going back. The food isn't healthy and it's poorly prepared."}
{"text":"This place is pretty dope if you're looking to have just a causal date, or a friend comes in to town and wanna catch up I would recommend this place to do so. But I came in with my fiancé & mother in law. they greeted us this friendly guy who probably owns the place sat us down, gave us our menu's we started to look at the menu and there food looks decent and pretty yummy and the lunch specials are reasonable to spend on but there drinks and chicken lo mein is the best but the service is fast and pretty competent. Would I go there again of course, highly recommend this place and nothing was bad all I give this place 5 star."}
{"text":"We gave Big Buddha a try when they first opened years ago. We were really unimpressed... But we recently decided to give them another go since most other Asian restaurants in Surprise are chains and, for the most part, nasty (I have to exempt Fresh Wasabi and SK as they are both great). Our minds have been changed, BB is really good food!

We have been a few times and everything has been very good! Favorites are the chow fun, house fried rice, happy family, and garlic chicken... For a very healthy twist, try the snow white chicken and skip the rice. Best egg rolls anywhere!"}
{"text":"Since moving into the area, my wife and I have been eating here weekly.

The service is always exceptional, and the food as well.

The orange chicken is my favorite in town, it is prepared a little differently than the usual - but I like it better. The orange sauce is actually orange-y and not BBQ sauce (like many places I have tried.)

We also have recently been quite enamored with the twice-cooked pork dish. It is pretty fantastic. 

The Mango tea, is also quite good.

I am relieved to finally have found a Chinese place, that has not only good service - but great food."}
{"text":"Great food I love the sesame chicken, and the service un matched your drink is low it gets filled. One of the best parts is they even hold their lunch specials on the weekends keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"So we've only gotten take-out but each time I've been very impressed with how nice they are. The food is absolutely amazing and it's not greasy. Whenever we go it's always packed inside which say a lot about the restaurant. Very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"This is actually the second time we have been to a big Buddha and our first experience was horrible. Food wasn't great and service was ok, but I try to never leave a review on a one time drop in Because even the best places can have an off day. So we waited a few months and tried again, and WOW I'm so glad we did. We went on a Saturday and it was really busy. We were seated right away and our waitress was great. She saw my yelp coupon for two free egg rolls before o could even bring it up and said she already places the order for us. Their menu is great and had quite a few things that many other places my husband and I haven't found anywhere else. My husband ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles extra spicy and I decided on the happy family which was a hard choice because I also saw Mongolian chicken. Our food came out so quick I actually was amazed. From the first bite to the last it was perfect. The portions are so huge even after two plates I had to get a to go box for the rest. We will definitely be back. I'm so glad we decided to give Big Buddha another try because I think we've found our new local spot for Chinese."}
{"text":"The place was clean as were the restrooms. The service was good, the staff was very attentive. However, the food was subpar. We got the pupu platter and sweet and sour chicken. It all lacked flavor. The chicken was a little dry. The white rice was good. I would be hard pressed to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Big Buddha was recommended as a place with \"great shrimp\" and they didn't disappoint in that regard. My family and I got lunch here on Memorial Day Weekend and shared the following dishes:
1) Jumbo Fried Shrimp (4) appetizer... $4.25
2) Beef Chow Fun
3) Shrimp with Lobster Sauce
4) Orange Peel Chicken
5) Egg Rolls (2) appetizer... FREE with Yelp app check-in

Ambiance:
-upscale decor, tastefully designed without being the slightest bit kitschy
-A/C kept the place nice and cool (almost cold) in the AZ summer
-nice patio outside, great for cooler weather
-several tables during the weekend lunch
-TV in the corner, a bit distracting
-one male and one female bathroom in the back, a bit awkward when there's a wait.

Service:
-our busser (female) was very friendly and stopped by the table several times to inquire about our meals, refill drinks, etc. 
-the waiter (male) literally took the order and that was it, he didn't seem too interested in our table, specifically. Had to go find him to use the Yelp check-in freebie.

Food:
1) Jumbo Fried Shrimp: great appetizer, went way too fast, would recommend ordering more than one for your table!
2) Beef Chow Fun: pretty tasty, lots of noodles and beef, would like to see more green veggies, too. Next time I will order spicy, if possible.
3) Shrimp with Lobster Sauce: the shrimp were amazing, succulent, delicious; however there weren't that many in there! we were left with a plate full of lobster sauce and vegetables before the dish even got around the table once.
4) Orange Peel Chicken: crunchy texture outside, juicy chicken inside. Winner! I would happily order it again. Not spicy at all, would recommend asking for hot.
5) Egg Rolls: great as a freebie, wouldn't order it on my own. Flavorless, kinda mushy veggies in the middle. Not a fan of the sweet and sour sauce/mustard they give you.

Overall, this place doles out tasty dishes with consistent table-side service. I look forward to dropping in from time to time. Sure beats driving all the way down to PF Changs!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here and gotten take-out several times, and have always been satisfied. It's nothing spectacular, but the food is still great, the atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice, they are fast and friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. If you're in the Surprise area and want some good Chinese food, I'd definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Huge portions for a decent price.  I went during their lunch special and I was not disappointed.  Everything we ordered was fresh.  Great customer service from the two ladies that took our order and served us.  My lunch meal came with a wonton,  soup of the day,  rice and an eggroll for $7."}
{"text":"This little Asian restaurant is one of my favorites. We eat there a couple of times a month. It is often busy and I'm not surprised because the food is just SO yummy. The chicken Egg Foo Young is the best I've ever had. The waiters are very knowledgeable about the gluten free items on the menu and helped my friend make her choice. The food always comes steaming hot and lots of it. It's well worth turning into this little strip mall of Greenway for a great meal."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are good! Small restaurant near the 303. Been coming here since 2008. The staff are friendly and the food is fresh! I've tried many plates and I haven't been disappointed..."}
{"text":"Driving back to my parents after spending the day in Sedona, we were all very hungry AND wanted to splurge for some tasty Chinese food.

We tried the orange chicken (good but not at all what we're used to) the veggie chow Mein, Mongolian beef and S&S chicken; all of which were similar to what we know in Seattle and all very good.

The best thing about this place was that our order was out in 5 minutes...no lie! 
The service was impeccable and very friendly. The bathrooms were also very clean and overall the restaurant looked to be the same.

We visit my parents in Surprise a couple times a year so I'm sure we'll be back and seeing as there aren't too many decent if not good restaurants in the area...it's a must go!"}
{"text":"I asked for shrimp fried rice and instead I got a big thing of white rice as a part of my order.  Yes is by the way my second nights going there in a row it's not as if I am not spending money there.   I called in to let them know that they gave me white rice instead of shrimp fried rice and I was told I could come in and pay the difference as if I wanted to come in a second time while I was in the middle of eating my dinner because it was actually my wife's dinner that they messed up so we had to split mine.  The food was average and not the greatest so they should have done more to make me happy, it would have made a difference.

Any good business should take care of their customers when they make a mistake and that's it. I have had similar things happen at Olive Garden, and other restaurants and they have taken care of me. Will not return."}
{"text":"Good food and a friendly place. Ordered take out and eatn in house 100xs here. The order is always right and food hot and fresh. Family owned business has consistently served good food. Great lunch specials. I haven't met anyone that didn't like this place. Glad they are still goin strong in Surprise. Thx Daniel, (owner)"}
{"text":"Great Asian Food!!! The restaurant atmosphere is great!! Our Fam. Fav is the Orange Chicken with Noddles!! The mango Tea is a Delish!! We never leave this place been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was good but I was surprised we were charged extra for a second bowl of rice. Most Chinese restaurants give you all the rice you want at no extra charge."}
{"text":"I love the family ambiance and good service . Also they have tofu lettuce wraps which is hard to find  in a typical Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be amazing, especially after reading the other reviews. It was just \"ok\". Some things were slightly better than average, some things were slightly below average. I'll try it again and see if something 'wow's me, but if not, moving on."}
{"text":"The food and service are both amazing! I don't typically like Chinese food, but I will always eat here...which is good because my husband loves it and even my picky kids beg to go! We have taken out of towers here and they say they can't wait to go next time they visit!"}
{"text":"It just doesn't get any better!  My son and I make the trip from central Phoenix for their tasty food.  I have recommended Big Buddha several times and everyone adds it to their list of favorites. The orange chicken is my favorite but I have tried other items on the menu and they are all amazing."}
{"text":"Great food... excellent Chinese food... they have the best organs chicken and egg rolls"}
{"text":"Their dishes are a hit and miss. Some dishes are okay. Other are very good.

I really enjoyed the singapore noodles and the shrimp walnut dish. Reasonable prices for some yummy dishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a good
Chinese place to eat in Surprise, and finally found
it Big Buddha today. We had the P.O. P.O. Platter
for 2, it was excellent we will be back and tell
our friends about it"}
{"text":"Food is good the price is mid level. But for AZ it's good food lol. Found some better planes near my house"}
{"text":"I can't post a picture because I couldn't stop eating my food. 
At every restaurant, I order Orange Chicken. 
This is the BEST Orange Chicken I've ever had. 
I will definitely come more often... especially for the Orange Chicken Lunch Special. 
It was only about $7.40 for the chicken, rice, egg roll, crab puff, and soup."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food and friendly staff. We got in, greeted, and sat quickly, prices were very reasonable and the lady waiting on us was just as cute as can be! Place is clean and comfortable, fancy enough to have dinner without feeling cheap.

We are fortunate to have Big Buddha less than a mile from home, so we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent Curry dishes. Good prices and great food. We love to get their lunch specials to save a little money."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had the orange chicken, pot stickers, crab puffs and chicken fried rice. The flavor of the orange chicken was good the chicken was all white and had a good texture however, the breading slid easily off of the chicken which was a bit annoying. The pot stickers were tasty but the outside was soggy. I guess some people like them that way but I am not a fan. The crab puffs were very good lots of cream cheese not a lot of crab. The fried rice was pretty good but there was too much chicken in the chicken fried rice. I like a high rice to other items ratio personally. 

All and all it was worth the drive. If the breading on the orange chicken would have stayed on the chicken I would have given it a four. I will give Big Buddha a second try though for sure."}
{"text":"Always something special from the Buddah kitchen. We've never been disappointed. Get the Orange chicken..."}
{"text":"Big Buddha is a great neighborhood Chinese restaurant. We generally get take out. They have Singapore noodles which is hard to find. The portions are good, the price is fair, and the service is prompt. I like that the egg rolls are not greasy and they taste as if they were prepared for your order and had not been sitting under a heat lamp for ever."}
{"text":"Purchase take out for family.... first time customer.
OMG biggest mistake of my life.  The food was the worst and we all got sick after an hour of trying to eat this nasty food. Needless to say the $50.00 of food went in to the garbage.  

Maybe Monday nights the \"goog\" cook is off but this, I would definitely  Not feed this to my dog."}
{"text":"I was really happy with our visit here. We came across it on accident, but we will be back for sure! Food was excellent, service was friendly, and price was great! It was the type of place where the servers actually knew the names of a good amount of customers! Dining room is cute and clean too! I would recommend this to anyone! 

We had the lemon chicken and kung pow (not sure if I spelled that correctly). They were both good. I LOVE lemon chicken and Big Buddha sure knows how to do it well."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in west valley big selection,  food is very consistent,  very nice take out boxes to help get food home.  Very accommodating."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 10 times with the same experience. The food here is extremely good. Never had an issue and the wait time is always fast. However I will never dine in mainly due to the younger girls at the front. Unbelievably rude not only to the customers, but to the other staff in there. I'm pretty sure the owners work in there and she was rude to them too right in front of other customers. The younger generation of customer service sucks which I'm sure we have all experienced now. But man, this is one of the worst. It's unfortunate but the food is too good to not at least get take-out!"}
{"text":"Really good food, nice little restaurant with a comfortable atmosphere and extremely friendly workers. I must admit I was a little disappointed with the shrimp in lobster sauce I had. I had to ask if it was white sauce as it should be or a weird brown sauce like some regions of China use. Unfortunately it WAS the brown sauce. I was told they could do the white sauce so I was happy about that, that is until I dug in and found a watery bland \"juice\" where my thick viscous lobster sauce should have been. Everything about my dish was delicious except the sauce, I was torn, the sauce is the key to the entire dish. Unfortunately I will not be able to order that dish again, my FAVORITE dish, sigh. Today I try the Kung pow shrimp, hope I am not disappointed again..."}
{"text":"I am giving them 5 stars because there is no other Chinese food here in Surprise that matches with them. We sometimes come in a big party (15-20) but had never waited for more than 15 minutes. 
My personal favorite is the fish in black bean sauce. My son loves their orange beef. My wife loves the tofu and eggplant dish. 
Never go to other Chinese restaurants in Surprise. This place is affordable, quiet, and the food is always good. It also helps that the service is excellent."}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed this food place every time we go or carryout. I personally love the seafood blossom soup is the best, also Wor won ton soup and the eggplant tofu pot . The services are very friendly we been going there for a long time ."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here once but i liked the food very much. What i ordered and also tasted of my friends orders were also good. Would recommend it"}
{"text":"Orange tofu was great, they should start using firm instead of medium tofu though make it a little less chewy, good either way though."}
{"text":"We had the buddha's delight and the eggplant with tofu lunch specials. While the prices were fair, the portions were small, so it all made sense. They special came with soup with the choice of egg drop or hot and sour. We all chose the hot and sour. It was doused in soy sauce and way too salty.
The other two vegetarian dishes were also much too salty. My uncle ordered the chop suey, he enjoyed it but he's on a cardiac diet and couldn't finish more than half of it. I suppose if you're okay with the intense amount of sodium content in your food, this place would've alright for lunch. 

We did enjoy sitting outside on the patio. It was a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"Finally found a good Chinese restaurant in the area, yay!  It helps that they're highly affordable AND they offer their lunch specials even on the weekends.  I ordered my fave - a chicken lo mein lunch special for just over $6.  It comes (as many do) with eggroll, cup of soup, crab puffs, sweet & sour sauce and fried rice.  The noodles were perfect (hard to find the kind I like - firmer), the eggroll was really good (also hard to find, some have too much ginger, or they add cinnamon or there is too much pork flavor, blah blah blah), and they have a unique, yet yummy sweet & sour sauce.  About the Lo Mein:  flavors were bold and savory, there was plenty of chicken, the veggies were fresh.  The rice was also really good but the eggdrop soup was the best I've ever tasted.  I ordered it over the phone and ran to pick it up, it was ready in about 8 minutes and they were really professional, fast and friendly.  The food was hot and the crispies were crispy (hate soggy puffs/rolls).  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good as freak!!! I got the Mongolian chicken. My only complaint was it wasn't spicy enough. Service, food and drinks were great! Food came out super fast! Warning: The plum wine made me talk weird ;)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a sit down chinese restaurant with Hot tea, good crab puffs and egg rolls, what we found was their Food was excellent! Prices were a pleasant surprise too.We are new to the area and  we wouldn't have found or tried this restaurant if it weren't for Yelp."}
{"text":"Okay - I have been going here for years now. Three years ago, I went vegetarian and they still had \"spring rolls\" on their menu. So, whenever I go in and order menu-less, I usually get veggie lo mein and order some \"spring rolls.\"(I have not been corrected by terminology in the last couple years) I have no idea when they changed their menu because their \"spring rolls\" are NOT, NOT, NOT VEGETARIAN!! They now put chicken in their rolls, it is just ground up so incredibly fine and overloaded with rice noodles and carrots. I now finally found out the reason why I always feel ill after eating at this place. Sorry Big Buddha, it's time to cut ties."}
{"text":"We've had the orange chicken, shrimp fried rice, sesame chicken, crab puffs, & teriyaki chicken. All of it has been consistently fantastic. Staff is super friendly & the mango tea rocks too. My favorite is definitley the orange chicken. The breading kind of reminds me of the mochiko chicken I had in Hawaii. So far we've had excellent experiences every visit! :)"}
{"text":"Came to this place because I saw it on Yelp. The food was good and the price was reasonable. I loved the fact that the food wasn't greasy at all. The restaurant was clean and the staff was good. I could see myself returning here."}
{"text":"I enjoy the beef chow fun and the honey walnut shrimp.  Taste like I'm back in San Fransisco so I would say pretty good Chinese food in Arizona :)
I like the fat noodles, lots of meat, strong flavors, and great portions.  They use onions and yes I do like it since it adds flavor to the dish, I just don't eat all the onions.  Only thing let on the plate is some onions after I'm done with it.  
If you want good Chinese food in Surprise this is the place."}
{"text":"This is American-style Chinese food, only dimly related to anything cooked in the Far East. Everything is served with a sweetish sticky sauce. That said, it's about as good as American-style Chinese gets. The sauces are distinct. For example, the Taiwan beef has a pleasant five-spice flavor. Being American, I thought it was fine.  My wife, who is Chinese, asked the lady speaking Mandarin if they have any Chinese food, and according to my wife she said \"No,\" So if you are looking for authentic Chinese food, forget it. However, the place is very busy, so they are clearly doing something right."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, fresh, and was delivered quickly. The gentleman that served us was not really good with his customer service as he lacked pleasantries, and was not happy when I showed him the check in offer for two free egg rolls. He also did not refill our drinks. Again, food was great, they just need to enforce better customer service."}
{"text":"Exceptional service - fast and super friendly.  Great value for lunch.   But...sadly, not my favourite meal.  Maybe it will be yours tho. Worth a try.  Egg rolls are tasty."}
{"text":"Decided to try some take-out today for lunch.  Called ahead and was told the food would be 10 minutes and sure enough when I got there it was ready.
The restaurant looked nice enough to even stay and eat but I didn't have time to do so.
Ordered the Mongolian beef which came with a side of fried rice, a crab rangoon, egg roll, and soup of the day (chose the chicken).  For the price, it wasn't bad in terms of the portion sizes.
Crab rangoon was fresh.  The egg roll was crispy and tasty.  I wasn't impressed with the Mongolian beef as compared to some of the photos I've seen on Yelp.  Beef was well cooked and despite asking for it to me mildly spicy, it wasn't even close, and there barely was any greens.
The rice appeared overcooked and was very brown as compared to the color of fried rice I've had at other places before (-1).
Will probably give them another try to sample other items from their extensive menu including the lunch menu."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Orange chicken and orange beef are my favorite and it tastes much better then panda.  Always busy which speaks for itself.   I'm a new regular!!"}
{"text":"Well have been here several times last year and a half, both dine in and take out.  The food is getting more greasy each time.  Also seems the prices have been upped slightly as well.  For dining in the options for kids are pretty rough as well.

The dine in experience can be very hit or miss.  The younger girls are very pleasant and attentive, and believe me this place keeps them busy, between running their tables and the endless stream of take out.

Unfortunately the older severs (owners?) are not as friendly.  Had a pretty bad experience there today."}
{"text":"Mongolian beef best I've had in AZ
Singapore rice noodles spicy curry yum
Great service
Clean 
Nice"}
{"text":"Wow! This is all I can say about Big Buddha. Yum yum yum yum yum. Tiny lil chinesw place w a cute patio and superb decorating skills. Modern and pleasing to the eye. The food is outstanding. Def try the twice cooked pork. I dont typically care for any bbq pork...until now. Its bomb n I crave it. Sake and beer for 5 bucks...score. The happy buddha beer is great. The service was outstanding. Everyone was so nice n friendly and on top of it for sure! I will definetly be back every time we visit arizona."}
{"text":"Ordered their take out last night. Food was cheap and quick. However. I highly recommend never dining with this restaurant. Their perceived most common selling dish the fried rice was suspicious to say the least. Very large rubbery pieces of egg in it. Now on to the orange \"beef\" it was dark dark meet almost the consistency of beef jerky. I had one piece and threw the rest out. I picked around the eggs in the rice, and without the eggs it was pretty good. But overall I highly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are regulars at this great place! Our favorite is the \"Spicey Boiled Wonton\" Holy Moly this dish is fab! We each get our own cause there is no way I am sharing. From Pot Stickers to the Orange Chicken and beyond, this place has tasty food. The service is always there-so welcoming and friendly!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the whole world! Amazing relaxing playlist, bomb tea, stellar prices, and I love the atmosphere. I could definitely do without them playing CNN however. Overall love coming here"}
{"text":"Minus 1 star for crunchy rice.  What is it about Chinese restaurants with crunchy rice?

So far I've tried the orange peel chicken (WAYYYYY better than Panda Express, imo), mongolian beef (okay, but really nothing to squeal about), tomato beef (would've liked for it to be a little sweeter, but other than that, it was goooood), egg rolls (small but yummy), and egg drop soup (same as any restaurant).

There's a reason the orange peel chicken is one of their house specials.  Moist pieces of white meat buckk-erk with a satisfyingly crunchy battered outside smothered in a slightly spicy tangy sweet orange peel sauce.  Freak-en awesome.

My advice:  If you have a rice cooker, make your own.   Take-out is better than eating in...it's a small cramped little restaurant, and lines tend to form outside.  If you want to eat there, go early.  

The lunch special with food enough for two averages about $5.50.

Don't trust the fortune cookies. 

Confucious does NOT say."}
{"text":"This is the most tasteless, boring Chinese food I have ever had.  They obviously don't know how to use any seasoning.  Skip this place and go the Chef Panda - much better."}
{"text":"Every time that I come here, i leave satisfied, full, and still with some money left in my wallet. Pricing is amazingly low for the quality and quantity of food that you get here.

Lunch menu runs till 3:30pm and it is really affordable."}
{"text":"Restaurant week with my mom continued tonight.  She likes Chinese food and this place is only about 5 minutes away from our house.  Seemed like a good time to head on over.  

We went inside and were seated immediately.  As soon as I sat down, I felt a little anxiety.  They do a bustling take out business but their waiting area is very tiny and it was right next to our table.  It felt like people were on top of us the whole time.  Every time you would lift your head, someone was there or looking your way.  A little bit uncomfortable.  If there is a next time, hopefully we will sit someone against the wall or something.  Anyways..........placed our order for Diet Cokes and actually used the Yelp check-in app in order to score us 2 free egg rolls!  We decided to go with Mongolian Beef and Orange Peel Chicken.  Here is how everything tasted...............

Egg Rolls-  Best part of the meal, by far!  There were 2 of them and you could tell they were homemade and they tasted great.  They are served with a little sweet and sour sauce with a pinch of hot mustard.  The egg rolls and sauce were delicious.  They were hot, fresh, crispy and hearty for being such small things.  I would definitely get them again and maybe even a few orders of them  in addition to the free one you get from the Yelp app. 

Mongolian Beef-  This was presented nicely with a ton of onions and beef.  I am spoiled though and am used to certain kinds of Chinese food (Golden Chopsticks in National City rings a bell).  I dug in to this and it tasted ok.  The meat was a little tough though and could have been seasoned just a bit more.  Not bad in any way, just nothing compared to other places that I have had Mongolian Beef before.  Portion size seemed just a bit skimp too.  Overall, it was just ok.

Orange Peel Chicken-  Once again, I am used to certain things when it comes to Chinese food and this was totally different.  Their Orange Chicken is basically a breaded chicken breast cut up into strips a la chicken katsu.  It was covered in a sweet tasting sauce that was just ok.  The breading on the chicken fell off pretty easily which was kind of annoying.  Once again, the portion was a tad skimp.

White Rice-  Rice was ok.  They give you a huge container of it at least.

Overall, everything was just alright.  We ate all the food presented to us and didn't have any leftovers (rare with Chinese food...it boils down to the kind of skimp portions though) and were not totally stuffed to the brim.  Service, while friendly, was a tad slow.  Will I come back?  Eh...possibly.  My wife doesn't eat Chinese food other than Pick Up Stix and PF Changs, so I will probably be rolling solo if I do come back.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing stood out as super delicious either.  A-OK about sums it up....maybe even on the low end of A-OK.  Total bill for everything including tip was around $30.00.  Fair enough I guess."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered take out from here for lunch today, and I thought it was pretty good.  I love their crab puffs because they are mostly cream cheese and not a lot of crab.  That's just my personal preference.

I eat mostly vegetarian (some fish), and I was happy to see some tofu dishes on the menu.  My friend had the curry tofu, but it was too spicy for her taste.  She liked the egg roll that came with it as well.  The curry had a nice sweetness to it that I liked.  I got the Buddha vegetables, and they were good.  They had a hint of ginger.  

Not a big fan of the sweet and sour sauce though.  It's that bright red generic stuff that doesn't have much flavor, IMO.  Would prefer something lighter.  Also didn't think much of the rice.

Overall we liked it and I will go back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time today and besides the fact that the place was packed, which is not necessarily a bad sign, it was pretty good. Some of the best egg foo yong I've ever had! The mushroom gravy is very light and flavorful and lots of fresh veggies and chicken with the egg. Service is just meh, but I'm sure that's partly because they just finished a lunch rush so I dont judge too harshly. Definitely worth a visit go outside of normal lunch hours would be my suggestion."}
{"text":"Can be crowded but worth it! Fried shrimp are terrific, but eat in restaurant for best experience. Pork fried rice and Sesame Chicken are terrific. Seated quickly, almost no wait for my food, owner came buy to ask how I was, the food was great as always. All love!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with a friend. I had the orange chicken lunch special. The service was good, they refilled my water quickly, and checked in on us multiple times. However, the food was \"alright\", I didn't really feel like it was anything special. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't be craving this or going my way to get it anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love it! Cant wait to eat here again. The egg rolls were the best Ive ever had. Sweet and sour pork is my all time favorite! And when I got take out they put the pork seperate from the sauce so it didnt get soggy..Fried rice is good also."}
{"text":"Big Buddha is amazing! The food is always fresh and delicious, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant itself is nice. They have good specials too! I'd definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Love love love this place for fast and fantastic Asian food!  From fried rice to egg foo young the flavors are hard to find anywhere else!
Owners and staff are friendly and so helpful
THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible!  We order and pick up at this location all the time.  Great food and great staff, they are so nice. One of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars only for the Singapore rice noodles because that's the only thing I get with extra vegetables not too many places in surprise that you can get this dish."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! Orange chicken was nothing like I've tasted before, delicious! The beef broccoli wasn't the best, I've tasted better before. However it was still good. The chow mein was great. Everything had amazing flavor! Great stop, if your in Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"Great food.  Probably the best Chinese I've had.  Glad Yelp helped me find this gem.  Will definitely return..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with indoor dining as well as outdoor. Good customer service. The food was OK but not what I am used to. General Tso chicken is their \"house chicken\" dish and they do it differently than most other places. Not bad if you're looking for something new and different to try."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Our kids are picky eaters and they devoured their food. We tried the chicken lo mein, orange chicken, and Mongolian beef. This is definitely our go to Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"I loooooove this place. It's by far my favorite Chinese restaurant out here in Arizona.. Its a gem! I ordered the mongolian beef and it was ooooon point. It was like... what heaven would taste like... 

No, seriously, this place is the bomb dot com."}
{"text":"Rude.  Came in tonight for the first (and last) time with my wife.  They asked if we wanted an outside table.  It was a little hot out.  There were empty tables inside.  I said we would rather sit inside.   The female staff person rudely said loudly, \"reserved!\"  We turned and left.  Learn how to treat potential customers."}
{"text":"Love this place;) This is my Mother /  daughter date placeGreat service and amazing food! The prices are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Had heard about this place so much I was excited to come in. First thing as we are walking in there was no greeting, a guy comes up ands sits us on the last table next to the bathroom, dnt even ask of that table was ok for us. The waiter comes up making faces and assumed we speaker Spanish and ask only God know what but I guess if we were drinking anything.  After they bring the food out never comes around to ask if there was anything we need. Food was not bad but serviceand  hospitality was the worst !!"}
{"text":"Would eat here again. Semi above average chinese for arizona. You will like this place if you like normal chinese food thats slightly better than panda. The place is pretty small and more than 2 people waiting up front becomes awfully cramped but I'm not there for the awkward closeness to strangers I'm there for food and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I like the food here, iThe Orange beef is awesome, and the staff is always friendly. Its to small though, time for a bigger place;)"}
{"text":"Great reviews thank you everyone or recommending this place, was looking for a good eat. This hit the spot."}
{"text":"Awesome place,  always good no matter if you are taking to go or dining in. Ask for extra heat they really give it to you. I always ask for onions added and they give me what I ask, every time. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow Yelpers we were able to find this true GEM to have a early dinner before a night spring training baseball game.  We had the house fried rice, orange chicken, sweet and sour shrimp and spicy thai flat noodle w/ beef and all the food was DA BOMB!!!  This place is very clean and had great service.  The decor was very nice.   if I come back for Spring Training..I know where to come when going to see either The Royals or Rangers."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been cing for years and it is always good."}
{"text":"Seated quickly....  But ordering was another thing.  Waited for 15 minutes and had to flag someone down.  Another 2 minutes and a third person finally took the order. 

Got the lunch specials.  Mongolian Beef and Sweet &  Sour Chicken. 

Mongolian Beef was good but some if the beef tasted off. Praying I don't end up sick.  Fried rice was good but had no veggies in it....  Not complaining about that!

Sweet &  Sour Chicken was \"just ok and swimming in the sauce\".  Egg rolls were not good but the crab ragoons were a \"good dessert\"  for after the meal. 

Over all...  It was OK.  Sadly per reviews it is the best this area has to offer.  That doesn't make me excited for this area."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places for a healthy meal, servers re nice, food is always well done and hot, pricing is not to bad, I recommend this place to anyone that would listen :)"}
{"text":"Brought my aunt from Pennsylvania for lunch
We thought the place was very clean 
Food was great
My kung pao was actually spicy!! 
The crab wonton was excellent, generously filled with cream cheese crab filling"}
