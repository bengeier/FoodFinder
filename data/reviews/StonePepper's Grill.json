{"text":"Ugh.. I really wanted this to be good... My husband and I went there with another couple.. Everything was cold.. Service was slow. The server told us a couple times that half the staff called off that night. I really do not like when people make excuses.. But half the staff calling off should not make our food cold and just plain bad. We will not go back..."}
{"text":"Food was meh, service was super slow even though the place was almost empty.  I will not return here."}
{"text":"Got the signature \"Hot Oil' Pizza with pepperoni and boneless wings. Pizza was very good. It was not extremely hot 'Spicy' which is what I was hoping. The wings were not great and they were covered in old shredded lettuce. I am rating so high because I went for the pizza not the wings. And I have only been there once. The service was great and fast."}
{"text":"Moderately priced.  Very good hummus.  Service was pretty good.  Mondays are half priced pizzas I guess.  Granted we didn't have one they looked good.  Beer selection was pretty good.  Nice place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent salads. I've had Walnut & Strawberry; salmon; and blueberry salads. Yum. The Chimay beer is fantastic-super trapist monk beers. Well managed and staffed restaurant.

Only drawback is that no bread is given with salads by default-ask for it though!"}
{"text":"Bad first experience for me.  Ordered the crab cake sandwich, which wasn't hot and a buddy of mine ordered one of their personal pizzas.  I made a comment to the waitress about my sandwich and she said \"these are hit and miss\" (then why do you offer them?).  Tried a piece of their pizza and didn't like it either.  I won't go back.  The place was empty on a Saturday afternoon, with good reason. Their food is awful."}
{"text":"The burgers are just so-so, but the salads are SPECTACULAR!  I really like the one with beets, chicken and goat cheese.  I mean how can you go wrong with beets and goat cheese?  The shrimp appetizer is also delicious and the shrimp are BIG!

The service is spotty and you have to ask to have your drinks refilled, but they are generally accommodating when you can hold their attention."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! Yum! I ordered the turkey burger and it was delicious! The waitress was extremely nice and checked on us frequently. I'm not sure whether it is typically busy, but we went on a Friday night and they were packed. I really enjoyed this place and it was fairly priced."}
{"text":"I've been to the Robinson location a number of times. Consistently slow service, unresponsive waitstaff and extremely sub-par food. My boneless buffalo bites were basically Tyson Anytizers. My friend ordered a pizza and it was covered in garlic salt rather than garlic butter and it was 100% unedible. This place exists in the \"just barely better than fast food\" category along with Applebee's, Chilli's, etc. Avoid. There are much better food options in Settler's Ridge."}
{"text":"Horrible food and an even worse owner.  Will never go back.  Several bad experiences.  Go someplace else."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Salads are fresh,generous, and very good.  Sandwiches are tasty and love the fries. Prices are within the average range."}
{"text":"Food was good. It's a shame that service was so bad. The place want even crowded, and it still took 10 minutes to refill our water. We won't rush back, but would give it one more shot."}
{"text":"I was so underwhelmed  and I was really wanting to like it. The food was less than mediocre we had slow service. I was really unimpressed and would go almost anywhere else in Robinson. I haven't been back since the first time, I'd say skip this one!"}
{"text":"Wont go back. 

My wife and I went here today. We walked in and waited for nearly 5 mins for some one to great us and seat us. It was 1 o'clock on a Monday so it was not busy at all. Once seated we looked over the menus. We ordered a pizza and a bacon cheese burger with fries( fries well done) to split, a side of ranch for the pizza and fries.  We didn't wait for our food for that long but when it came out the waitress forgot our ranch..... And Said the fries would still be another min or 2. Now I figure cooks are cooks for a reason. They cook for a living. So if a waitress says I have to wait for my fries it's her fault not the cooks she forgot to tell him well done. The pizza was doughey the bacon on the burger wasn't crispy. The food was below average at best. I had to ask the waitress for a refill. And for her not refilling my drink on her own and not bringing my food all out together I giver her a 1 out of 10 and her tip reflected that. I wouldn't not waist your time going here."}
{"text":"Not bad Settlers Ridge! 

I stopped in here with the pops for a quick dinner and was pleasantly surprised! 

The menu is pretty extensive, ton of salads, sandwiches, a couple entrees. Solid wine list. 

Pro: Pretty interior, interesting menu, outdoor seating, friendly service 

Con: Kinda dead for a happy hour

Overall: Will definitely go back! I am not sure if its a chain I am assume so because its in Settlers Ridge, given that... pretty good settlers ridge."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty bad at first. They had one server and he was swamped. The manager ended up bringing out our drinks and we asked if he could get the server to order... In my mind, this should be his cue to take over for the struggling server. But, he says ok and walks away... About 3 minutes later he comes back, because the server has still not come over, and says he can take the order. Other than this hiccup, it was a pretty good experience. 

We had 2 margaritas, but they didn't come with salt?? The hot oil pizza, and I had nachos (BF had a chicken wrap). The food was decent, pizza was better than decent, but the nachos had the kind of cheese that comes out of a can on in... meh. 

I probably wouldn't have gone there except that we had a gift card... and I probably wouldn't go back except for the gift card, but it wasn't bad. I might get pizza takeout if I lived near there."}
{"text":"me and my boyfriend eat here pretty often. the salads, pizza, pasta and fish tacos are amazing! we have also had alot of their apps which are always good. bf did get a burger one time and he wasn't thrilled with it but we still love the food. service is always great as well and  they have a great drink selection and bar area. the only thing that sucks is parking but that isnt even their fault."}
{"text":"Went here with three other people for dinner the services was slow even thought the place was half empty.  All of the food we ordered was cold two people ordered the crab cakes and steak entree, a steak salad and I had the fish tacos every single piece of food was cold even my grilled asparagus.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars is they gave us our meals for free because they were so bad.  And the bright note for the evening was the appetizers were pretty good we had the crab dip and lettuce wraps but I will say that I will not go back here again and risk ruining a night out again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after a movie at Cinemark Saturday night for a quick meal. For being only 9 pm on a Saturday, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was empty and we were sat in the bar area. The bar also only had a few people dining. 

The menu is large and has anything you might want including pizzas, apps, salads, wraps, burgers, sandwiches, pastas and entrees. I ordered the filet mignon salad while my husband ordered the filet mignon and crab cake dinner witha caesar salad.  The food arrived quickly and was exactly as we ordered it. I enjoyed the added crunch of the onion straws on my salad but would have preferred more lettuce and less cheese. The salad was covered in what I believe was cheddar and mozzarella. My husband enjoyed most of his meal as well but thought that the crab cakes were rather dry. When he asked the waittress for a sauce, she brought him a small container of lobster bisque soup. Hmmm. We were thinking more along the lines of a tartar sauce but the soup was tasty and complimented the crab cake. 

All in all, seems to be a good place to grab a drink/dinner before or after a movie."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a few times now. There are several positives to speak of: they have a good selection of food (pizzas, burgers, pastas, sandwiches and salads)  and several varieties of each, and everything we have had is well prepared. The beers are good and reasonably priced. This is a nice place, with good seating and a nice atmosphere. There are always plenty of customers, but we are usually seated promptly, even when other eateries in the area are having long waits.

The food is good but not great; basically tasty and enjoyable, but nothing that makes you really crave having it again, nothing that you feel you would just HAVE to recommend. Some of the entrees are a little pricey, too. Our biggest issue has been uneven service. For example, on one visit we had a polite server, but she rarely checked on us and we seemed something of a distraction for her, as she seemed more focused on a larger table ordering lots of drinks, and I don't think my drink was ever re-filled. On out last visit the young lady helping us was friendly and got our order right, but took amazingly long times between checking on us and we waited nearly 25 minutes for our food, during which time she only came once and we were not updated at all during that time. Overall the wait staff seems friendly and nice, but inattentive or unconcerned on a deeper level.

That being said, it is a nice dining establishment that has a good selection of agreeable foods, and is a good selection if you are shipping or going to the movies at this shopping area."}
{"text":"Chopped Chopped Salad....    should be a verse in the Lunch Lady Song.

I visited the restaurant for lunch.   I am not sure what everyone orders but I ordered the Big Bang Shrimp Chopped Salad.   It was awesome.

You have the crunchy spicy shrimp on top a really good salad.

Service - Very good - food came quick, it was cooked right and I had plenty of refills.

Atmosphere - It was lunch but I want to come back for happy hour.

Cost - $10"}
{"text":"Ordered 8 0z Filet Mignon & loaded red skinned mashed potatoes, received instant spuds, and (2) 4 oz filets - management says 'they send it to us like that'.  Ordered 'grilled' veggies, received boiled veggies.  Ordered 90 Minute Dogfish Head Beer, received 60 minute.  Told all drafts & bottles $1 off for Happy Hour - bill arrives, told bottled Duvel is not included.  Waitress tells us the place is better for lunch.  Over priced trash & horrible management.  *Never again*"}
{"text":"One day I was out with one of my girlfriends doing some shopping, and rather than stick with our typical go to of PF Changs, we decided to give StonePepper's a chance.  She had raved about one of the other locations, and since this was closer to home, she wanted to give the Settlers Ridge location a shot.  

In a nutshell, this is your run of the mill bar and grill.  Service was decent, food was good (nothing to write home about) and the overall experience was just okay.  Nothing bad can be said about the place, nor can anything great.  For a booming area like the Robinson area, there are plenty of other options to try and explore, and there are plenty of better good old standbys to stick with."}
{"text":"Pizza/Burger/Salad Restaurant.  I've been there twice.  i was mildly disappointed both times by the burgers, but not disappointed enough that I wouldn't give the brick-oven pizza a shot the next time someone suggests it.

I got the Chili-burger this time.  The chili was relatively tasteless.  The waitress told our group that one of the other waitresses had called off, so she apologized in advance for slow service. . . but she wasn't particularly slow.

All things considered it was an okay lunch with decent service in a nice development.  It suffers from being surrounded by better alternatives, but isn't a bad fallback when you're tired of the same ol' restaurant.  Steer clear if you're looking for something groundbreaking.  Stop by if you don't like straying too far from your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Not up to the hype.  Prices are on the high side for the average food.   The place has a nice feel and look, but I'm just not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Oh so very average.
Service was fine, but the food seem routine, processed, and not good and not bad.

It felt like this place gets the overflow from nearby chains where the wait to be seated is long on a saturday night"}
{"text":"Settlers Ridge is filled with chain restaurants, and while a lot of them aren't bad, it does get tiresome eating the same thing over and over again. That's why I'm glad I found Stone Pepper's Grill tucked around the back of the Ridge (that's right, I just gave a the street name for Settlers Ridge) between Barnes and Noble and LA Fitness.
There's nothing exceptional about this restaurant- the service is OK, the ambiance isn't anything special, and the food is good but not great. What I like about this place is that it gives variety in a location that doesn't give much. 
I do like the apple walnut salad, and their mushroom pizza is also very good. I've also had the pasta here a few times, and it is also good.
The menu is diverse and the price is average. Also, they have gluten free items, which is nice, and everything I've had there is fresh,
If you're looking for something different at the Ridge, swing by Stone Pepper's for something different and local."}
{"text":"Went there with my assistant one day for lunch.  After a few minutes of waiting for someone to seat us, we were taken into a very nice, but very empty, dining room.  The menu seemed pretty good with a lot of options.  When the food arrived it was adequate and nothing more.  I had a salad and my assistant had a wrap of some kind and ordered a side of ranch for her fries.  The waitress forgot the ranch.  No big deal.  Five minutes or more later she finally came back with it and immediately left without noticing that my drink (which was sitting on the edge of the table) was empty.  The next time we saw her (about 20 minutes later) was to drop off the bill.  Needless to say, I was not happy.  When you pay a couple bucks for a soda, a refill might be nice.  At least she could have checked to see if the food was ok, but nothing.  Terrible service from beginning to end and adequate food.  I'll go next door to Red Robin or to PF Chang's if I want lunch at Settlers Ridge in the future."}
{"text":"Tonight we were looking for a girls night out place for dinner with the women in the family and someone suggested stone pepper grill.   And what a great suggestion!  It wasn't busy at all in a Tuesday night so we got  right in. Our waiter, chris, was a gem.   He tolerated my sisters 30 questions about the pumpkin beer with a smile!   We ordered a hamburger, chicken  and walnut salads, quesadilla and portabella mushroom pizza.  All were yummy!   The only thing that wasn't was the signature oriental cole slaw - way to peppery!    There were lots of choices for beer on tap - sis didn't get the pumpkin beer after all that lol. We had a great time.  This was the sixth restaurant ive eaten in this week in Pittsburgh and all have been great!"}
{"text":"We were going to Cinemark and needed a place to eat. I had been here once before and couldn't recall having a good or bad dining experience, so I leaned toward the fact that it must have been okay. We walked in and were seated right away as the restaurant was not busy. I could tell from the get go that this wasn't going to be a good experience. Our waitress was too busy sitting and texting to be bothered with us. My boyfriend ordered chili and couldn't eat it. It was that bad. Our waitress didn't realize until she brought our  food, because she was busy with the customer she had on her cell phone. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya and he said it was bland. I ordered pepperoni pizza and it was just average. We ordered a second round of drinks with our meals because we knew our waitress wouldn't be back. Its such a shame as they have a nice outdoor area and the restaurant itself is very nice. But the service and pricey bland food hardly make it worth it. I hope her phone customer tipped her better than I did."}
{"text":"I started going to the location in Upper St. Clair and when I heard they were opening one in Robinson I was happy. A little closer to home. Have been to this location a good number of times and went there today to find it has closed. Always had great experiences at Upper St. Clair. This location was alright but had some issues. Waitstaff was always great but the food was mostly great but sometimes had issues. Never was very busy when I was there. Sorry to see it didn't make it. Now I see of the three locations just USC is still open. I hope that one stays. It's always busy and has great food."}
