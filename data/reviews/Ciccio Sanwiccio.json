{"text":"Been here on numerous occasions. Generally quite good but lacking consistency. The concept is simple here: two Italian guys serving up classic Italian fare, with a focus on sandwiches.  I really do like the sandwiches here, they're big and filled to the max. I will agree with some of the other posters in saying that it's a bit pricey here. You have to be specific with them here as I've noticed they have the tendency to do what suits them in the moment. For instance, I like my bun toasted. Sometimes they stick it in the oven for a few seconds, or on the grill, or last week, they popped the entire sandwich in the Panini press (delicious).   Yes, I have had better. But I still enjoy this place for a quick bite on the rare occasion."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and love the food. Large, juicy sandwiches with great flavour. I usually order the combo with soup as the option. I'm a huge fan of the pasta fagioli soup as it's so hearty and tasty.  The combo is a lot of food and very filling."}
{"text":"Pasta fagioli (tomato bean soup), eggplant parmigiana sandwich WITH an extra grilled zucchini - my $10 combo set to die for!  I often been eating there when I lived nearby. Still have cravings...  Tip: when you want chicken and veggie sandwich, it's cheaper to get chicken sandwich and add veggie (zucchini or eggplant) than to add chicken to veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place. Traditional Italian dudes slinging traditional Italian sandwiches. Their veal and chicken parms are light and crispy. The buns are pillowy soft and have a great sauce on them. Haven't tried the pastas, but the sandwich is a good option if you can't make it out to California or Mustachio's in St. Lawrence."}
{"text":"Hands down the best veal sandwich in Toronto. No question about it. The sauce is phenomenal here.  California sandwiches has got nothing on Sanwiccio. Trust me.  Staff are very friendly too.  Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"Most appalling customer experience ever. Young man at the cash so rude - ordered a meatball sandwich and he said we could not use the grated Parmesan shaker - that's for pasta only. Caesar salad tasted like it was made with Renee dressing, and again, no Parmesan cheese - not even a sprinkle of the fake stuff. Just lettuce, gobs of dressing from a jar and tiny store bought croutons. Cashier yelled at our son for flicking the light switch in the basement on the way to the bathroom - he's 10. When we spoke to him about his rudeness, he got angry and aggressive - he actually yelled at us. The owner stood by silently. Thankfully another customer had to come to the counter in our defence and told the owner the customer service was not good. A horrible experience all around.  No stars."}
{"text":"Veal sandwich is absolutely delicious. Enjoy it every time. Also recommend the sausage. The buns are fresh. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Sanwiccio!  It's lunch time.  You're at Yonge and Bloor.  What should you eat? Sushi...again? Shawarma...again? Greasy burger....again? Vietnamese sub from Ginger (which are still mighty tasty)...again?  Sometimes you want something else.  Now, that something else can be a giant Italian sanwiccio! This new location of Ciccio Sanwiccio opened up 3 weeks ago.  I've eaten sanwiccios at Ciccio Sanwiccio's other location of  at Yonge and Lawrence.   The sanwiccios at the new location are pretty comparable to the sanwiccios at the original location.  Sanwiccios are made with all fresh ingredients assembled right before you eyes.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana sanwiccio ($5.50) I hate paying for extra toppings on my sanwiccio.  Peppers $1.00 Mushrooms $1.00 Onions $0.50  The sanwiccio was filling and hit the spot....but still not enough stuff vs. bun for my liking.  The service was spectacular.  Very friendly as they assembled my sanwiccio..  They asked me twice if I wanted more tomato sauce on my sanwiccio.  I still have to try the pasta specials, when I get bored of sanwiccios.  I'd give the sanwiccios themselves about 2.5 stars. But the service is great, and compared to other lunch places in the area, it's a nice change... Also, I like using the word sanwiccio as many times as I can in a review.  3 stars. :)"}
{"text":"Sandwiccio!!! ...Sorry, it's just fun to say.  There are a lot of restaurants in the area, but since I was grabbing a quick bite alone, this place was perfect for that.  A small sandwich shop, the owners are super friendly. Everything is made with fresh ingredients and they have pasta specials that looked fabulous.  However, I decided to order a sandwiccio. Again..because it's fun to say.  The most popular is the veal (not a surprise). $5.50 for the veal sandwiccio + $1.00 cheese + $1.00 mushrooms  Sandwiccio content distribution: 70% kaiser, 15% veal,10% sauce, 2.5% cheese, 2.5% mushrooms = tasty, fresh, too much bread, not enough baby cow.  I haven't found another place in the area that is similar for quick eats, I'm sure I'll revisit."}
{"text":"Decently good sandwich shop but nothing close to California Sandwiches or other independent Italian joints I've tried.  But I'd come back if I had a craving, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Introduced a year ago and try and go as much as possible. The veal sanwiccio is amazing, and I usually order it with spicy meat sauce (extra 2$). Phenomenal. The meatball sandwich is also very good."}
{"text":"I used to work close by and I would always ALWAYS get their minestrone soup and chicken parm.  These guys are traditional, nice and super funny.  I will definitely go back and try other things."}
{"text":"Veal Panini is absolutely amazing. I have had it 3 times now and WOW. You want a nice big veal Sandwich go here.   P.S. I signed up to yelp just  so I could share my satisfaction !!"}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place after walking around the neighbourhood with a friend of mine and realizing that I'd skipped lunch and was getting a little hungry. I didn't want anything complicated, and seeing their pasta offerings I went for gnocci, because gnocci is, science has proven, awesome.  It was simple. And it was out fast. And it was absolutely delicious.  What else do I really need to tell you. Simple and quick and great."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get meat tortellini, or any of their pastas, really. Great portions. I have only had a sandwich here once or twice, and remember it being good, but not my preference."}
{"text":"This place should be avoided at all costs.  Luckily, I was not subjected to the food, but I came here for lunch whilst my two co-workers wanted to try a sandwich.  The owner/manager was making sandwiches with one rubber gloved hand and the other hand (not gloved) holding his cell phone while he spoke in Italian for the entire 20 minutes we were waiting. He took orders in between chatting on the phone and never once put it down.  One co-worker was given her sandwich immediately and we waited patiently for the second. Waiting...waiting...more waiting. After 10 minutes we enquired about the second sandwich. Oops. He forgot about it.  To top off the experience, both claim the sandwiches were fairly horrible. Roast beef consisted of: HUGE bun, not enough roast beef and way too much mustard.  Good thing I didn't eat here."}
{"text":"I don't know about other Ciccio locations but our group's experience at this one was more thank A-ok (3.5 stars)! I tried the popular veal sandwich, and while the amount of meat did not come anywhere close to San Francesco's (one measly cut), the overall sandwich tasted better (I'll come back to this after a few more San Francesco'ses!).  Toppings of caramelized onions, halved mushrooms, and provolone made for a tasty sandwich that tasted very fresh.  Other sandwiches I tried, including smoked meat, and meatball were also good choices, with the eggplant parm looking very enticing as well! I have to say, on my next trip, my likely choice will be the smoked meat sandwich with an Italian twist, and sans jalapenos.  The Vodka Penne wasn't all that impressive to me, but Bijan will have more to say about that."}
{"text":"This place has opened up in the old Simply Zoup location.  You certainly can get a large amount of food here for under $10. I had the meatball sandwich.  It was a little dry for my liking, maybe could have used more sauce.    The owner's son was working and we had a nice chat about the business and how things were going for the new shop.  He seemed like he didn't want to be there but had the obligation to help out his family with their new business."}
{"text":"I'll willing to change my rating after I order something else.  Ordered the eggplant parmigiana.    Service was awesome, very Italian, but the sanwiccio itself was soggy and had only tomato sauce and some cheese.  It took me two bites to realize that the 'wich wasn't for me.  I'd be interested in trying their minestrone soup or zuppa con fagioli (beans).  Their salads looked fresh, tasty, well-prepared, although neither their pasta nor their pasta sauce appeared to be anything special.  ~~~ I have gotten into the habit of having only the occasional eggplant sandwiches from Mustachio's in St. Lawrence Mkt.  They have fried onion slices, green peppers, and deep fried eggplant that's still crispy to the bite."}
