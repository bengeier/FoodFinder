{"text":"I've been to Dong Khanh when they were located in Chinatown, then Crescent Heights and now 18ave.  It's one of those restaurants that wouldn't wow you with their service or their decor so don't expect much.  In fact, they've been shut down before because they failed health inspection.  This place is not for the picky eaters.

The food is decent enough for me to come back a few times though.  I usually order the Pho Sate there which has a thicker coconut soup base.  Not the best Pho Sate but this was the first Pho Sate I had when I was a kid so it's memory lane whenever I have this.  The bowl is small, bland and probably not worth the high price though.  Try the Bun Bo Chien (I hope I spelled that right) which is a fried cake with egg.  Also, try the special noodles with liver, intestines, and unknown parts etc."}
{"text":"Dong Khanh is the BEST place to eat wonton soup!!! enough said. It a Chinese Vietnamese restaurant... Their specials taste great, it comes either dry or soup based! I usually have the soup and it taste amazing. 

I used to go there every Saturday morning and it was always crowded, the waiting line was so long but it was totally worth the wait!

They're not so clean considering all their dirty dishes were in front of the customer kinda disturbing, but it's in the corner."}
{"text":"I love love love their special noodle soup here!!!  ... but their pho noodles are just ok.  Definitely can use lots of renovations to clean the place up.  Be warn - restaurant overall is very dirty and don't ever try to peek into their kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Dong Khanh has been around for 30+ years in Calgary. Family owned business. It serves most Vietnamese  dishes plus, Chinese-Vietnamese dishes like the 3 dishes I uploaded here. It as authentic as we can get in Alberta. Its very busy here, mostly Chinese-Vietnamese eat here. Recommended to try but It might be too exotic for some people."}
{"text":"When I arrived the place was absolutely packed and I was really excited. However the prices are a little more expensive and the portions a little smaller than other Vietnamese places I have been to in Calgary. Service was great but because of the price and portions I give it three stars."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to see a restaurant in the NE still charging a reasonable price for their food and drinks. Caf√© sua da is still under $4!!! Haha! Most dishes are under $10. It's not the cleanest place, but the service is quick and the food is decent."}
{"text":"It was my grandma's idea to go here for lunch while we were in Calgary.

Apparently their \"specials\" are the noodles either dry or with the soup base. I also ordered fresh coconut juice and it was so expensive! The coconut juice was ~$3 when it just came from a carton that they poured out. When they gave me my drink, there were black bits floating in the juice...which looked like dirt.

It was very unappealing for me to see their unwashed dishes sitting in the plastic bins on the floor where customers can see it. They should really put that in the kitchen where customers can't see them.

The entire family ordered their \"special\" noodles with the soup on the side and we were VERY disappointed. I've never had terrible Vietnamese food where I complained about it until now. The majority of the meat consisted of liver that were sliced very thickly and were huge! The meat and noodles had no flavour in it so I decided to sip the soup to potentially make it taste less plain. Unfortunately the soup base had no flavour as well =(.

In conclusion, I will never ever recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
