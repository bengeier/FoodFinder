{"text":"Tried Bihari Kabab on a trip to Ontario to visit family, and I am hooked.  It's now a special request on return visits.  It's amazing that such delicious food is hiding in such a seemingly random, low-visibility location.  My experience with Pakistani food is lamentably limited (to Patna Kebab in Scarborough, also tasty, and a few lesser options in Vancouver), but I have to say that the food at Bihari Kabab was love at first bite for me.  The biryani is delicious.  The spices and lamb essence are well-incorporated throughout the rice.  The lamb is also rich, tender, and plentiful.  It is my new favourite biryani.  The karahi is bright and very flavourful, full of reduced-tomato goodness.  The paya and nihari were very rich, with the collagen-infused thickness that might be expected of such stews.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, the flavours of these dishes are more subtle than that of the karahi, and so they might be overwhelmed if eaten at the same time.  But taken on their own, each is delicious with the freshly-baked, fluffy, round, naan.  (If you are not familiar with paya or nihari, you should be aware that they are intentionally rich, fatty, comfort foods.  They may not be your favourite if you are not a fan of heavier foods.)  As might be expected from the name, Bihari Kabab also offers a selection of kebabs.  While I am confident they would be well-prepared, I was too smitten with the stews and the biryani to give them the attention they undoubtedly deserve.  Overall, great food in an unexpected location.  I really hope that word-of-mouth can help this business firmly establish itself, in spite of its low-visibility location.  I am looking forward to returning on my next visit."}
{"text":"Horrible place. I made the mistake of bringing my family here. You can hear the cashier/owner swearing in the back. The food was not any better. Burnt Bihari Kabab and unwashed Salad. The owner used to work at another store as a cashier a while back. He is NOT a cook, this is why he moved here from his last location on Morningside in Scarborough. READ those reviews."}
{"text":"This place is located in a nondescript little strip plaza on the south side of Kingston Rd just west of Liverpool in Pickering. Not much in the way of ambience, I'm afraid. However, the food I have tried here has been delicious, and my daughter and son-in-law, who are quite the \"foodies\", agree.  I am not very conversant with Indian/Pakistani food, but do know what I like, and really enjoyed the food at Bihari Kabab.  The lamb \"dum biryani\", beef nihari, and lamb kahari, were all fabulous, with many layers of flavour. The deep rich flavour of kahari can tend to overpower that of the nihari (would suggest possibly enjoying them at different meals). We almost had the nihari leftover; but once the kahari was gone and we began to concentrate on devouring just the nihari with the buttery naan, the nihari's subtle and delicious spicing shone through. The buttery naan to accompany the meal was perfect.   Will definitely be back."}
