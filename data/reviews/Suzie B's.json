{"text":"I had a delightful omelette consisting of egg whites, spinach, feta, and onions. Yes I did say egg whites because I am a fancy man and fancy men such as myself can not stand the thought of our taste buds being deluded with yolks."}
{"text":"A fairly typical family run and locally owned breakfast and lunch place. Casual atmosphere, home cooked food, and friendly people."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving ... while not the most glamorous place to dine, the food is amazing ... and the servers are always nice and on top of things.  The breakfast are fantastic, from Omelettes to French Toast (I've eaten here a few times while in Pittsburgh visiting). The breakfast sandwiches look fantastic too.  Knowing I'll be too tired to cook when I get back home after the long drive, I always go for breakfast the day I leave and get an Italian Cold Cut sub to bring home for dinner ... OMG ... yeah, that's a good idea and always is absolutely delicious!   Great place so if you're in the area from out of town and looking for a local great breakfast place, this is it ... and get a sandwich for the drive home but keep it in the trunk in the cooler so it makes it home .. lol"}
{"text":"Excellent as always.  A quaint family owned operation that has converted a store front into a dive diner. The service is very friendly and always makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Went for Breakfast with my mom.  Food was AMAZING and service was AWESOME! We had the French Toast and the mix with peppers eggs sausage and cheese it was sooo good! It does look to get pretty busy but we'll worth it! I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Lovly Sunday morning breakfast spot  nothing too fancy  small home town diner nice size portions for the price i love the omelets my wife enjoys the french toast"}
{"text":"Service was adequate.  I had pecan waffle 2 eggs side.  Waffle was ok...a little light on the pecans for my taste.    The 1 refill on ice tea was a little different.  Used to drinks having unlimited or no refill.  Overall fine for a breakfast, but didn't impress me greatly."}
{"text":"Food that is no frills. Service that was brief and impersonal.  Less than a basic diner and deli. This could be described as a hole in the wall. The need for a great breakfast place still is needed in the area, I hope they someday fill that need."}
{"text":"Come here a LOT for breakfast, Always Great Food and Courteous Service, and they Grill Mancini's bread for you.....LOVE IT....."}
{"text":"Excellent diner! I had a beautiful spinach and feta omelet, it was wonderful. Server was pleasant and my meal was served in a timely fashion!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little spot right off of 519 that is a perfect spot for breakfast. My dad and I both had the mixed grill with sausage, veggies and toast. I had the small, which was more than enough - but there is also a large size. The service was friendly and attentive , although not very hurried. This suits me just fine as I didn't have anywhere to be and don't mind taking my time and visiting with those around me - but for someone in a rush this might no be ideal.  They had sold out or cinnamon rolls by 9:30 am, and they looked GOOD - so I'm hoping to snag one on my next visit.  The menu isn't extensive but covers the basics. They are only open for breakfast and lunch.  Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"The new ownership is awful. Avoid at all cost. They have the same sign and same menu but when I asked why the food was prepared totally different and by different I mean terrible i was told too bad that's the way we do it. I told them they should warn people that had been going there for years and expected the same experience and she called me a bozo. The old ugly lady at the counter is awful and shouldn't ask how the food was if she can't take a real answer. Pure vile from that woman and her staff was incompetent and I heard the main cook say he'd never worked in restaurant before. Waitress had no idea what was going on. It's a complete disaster"}
{"text":"Suzie B's is a quaint diner. Really nice stop for breakfast, or lunch. They don't have many options for non-meat eaters, but I was able to make it work. They also have a deli area which is nice to grab a quick sandwich and go.  Service is normally friendly, and it is in a convenient location right off of Rt. 19, and interstate 79.  If you are a diner kind of person, check this place out!   Me, I'm more of a brunch with bloody mary/mimosa kinda girl."}
{"text":"If I could post zero stars I would. Service is non existent. Came in for breakfast. Place was half full. Sat for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. The two servers kept walking on by. Normally I would stop them but wanted to see just how long it would take.  Ended up walking out without ever being waited on. I've eaten here before and the service is usually decent. Not now, not with current staff. It's a shame because the food is usually decent."}
{"text":"This visit was my second time here and I'm disappointed again.  I really wanna like this place but I can't. It's almost impossible to find a parking spot being there lot is so tiny. On walking in you seat your self and the menus are already at the table. It was almost 15 minutes before I was even greeted and place a drink order. I ordered traditional breakfast of two eggs (over easy) with choice of meat (two sweet sausage patty's) and home fries with choice of bread (I chose mancinis Italian). The food took another 25 minuets just to arrive at the table. By that time the home fries where kinda cold and the eggs where very over cooked there was almost no dippy to it and I ordered over easy. The sausage tasted like frozen great value sausage from Walmart. Overall I'm just very upset with my experience here and I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"One word: roaches.   Because Yelp requires a longer review: Is there anything worse than that? I don't think so."}
{"text":"We seated ourselves after standing and waiting to be seated. We then sat another 10 minutes before anyone greeted us and took our order. Another 10 minutes went by and we helped ourselves to get our water that we ordered to drink. We then waited 30 minutes and never got our food. We left hungry and wasted an hour of our time. Oh, and the bathroom was dirty and they don't shovel the snow from the front or their building."}
{"text":"It pains me to not give a better review because there is a lot of positive things about this place. The staff are very nice but the service is slow. The food has potential and sometimes is very good but they don't seem to get cooking times right. I've had pancakes that were very under cooked in the center (though the time before that the pancakes were some of the best I've ever had). Over medium eggs were under cooked and slimy near the yolk. They do very good home fries. I'd be tempted to come just for them. Our waffle was cold. I think timing is the big enemy here and since they are new they might get it down so I'd still give the place a try."}
{"text":"Don't judge Suzie B's by the interior or the service, which was friendly but not really that great. Despite messing up our orders at first and a weird, quiet cafeteria-style atmosphere, the food was very good and fresh. Real eggs, fresh fruit, and steady coffee refills. Worth a visit (if you can find a parking spot). Oh, and don't believe the menu when it says only one refill of coffee. We had three cups each and didn't get charged extra."}
{"text":"Amazing! Excellent food and great service. You can really feel the family when you are at Suzie B's. Open for breakfast and lunch with breakfast served all day. Suzie's BEEutiful BOUNTIFUL BREAKFAST will fill you up. Did I mention that the service was spectacular. Will definitely be back!!!"}
