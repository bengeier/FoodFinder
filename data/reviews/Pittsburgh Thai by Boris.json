{"text":"Awesome food and great spice levels. Usually get the off menu \"20\" and barely can finish."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch earlier today with my dad, beating out a slight rush. Three other groups came in shortly after us. We were quickly seated and ordered within a few minutes. For appetizers we got the steamed dumplings and the Thai toast. The dumplings were some of the better I've had in pittsburgh, but the Thai toast was the star in my opinion. It was flaky and crispy and the sauce served with it was just perfect. For our main dishes my father ordered a seafood soup with glass noodles, I only tried the broth but it was definitely tasty. I got the spicy mango curry chicken, this was one of the best curries I have ever tasted. The perfect amount of both sweet and spicy. Overall, service was good, food was amazing, check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was in the mood for some Thai since it reminds me of My time in The Marine Corp. I went in and (GARY) the old slender man in the front desk was pretty RUDE, considering his age I over looked it. I then made my order of a Thai Tea and he filled it with ice all the way to the top on a 16oz glass. I actually enjoyed the 1/4 of the Tea in it and it left me thirsty for more but it cost $2.00 plus for another 4oz of it. I went ahead and ordered a Red Curry Fish Meal to go and to my surprise it was good.

I returned today for seconds and this time I wanted to seat in to enjoy the whole experience. Now I love going on (YELP, URBANSPOONS, and TRIP-ADVISOR) for good illustrations on what to explore as my Cravings gets excited. 
So I sat down and the same slender older man (GARY) comes over to set the table for me and I said to him. (I'm back for seconds :) he then brought me the Menu and I compared what I read and whats on my phone as I  look up to see which meals looked appetizing so I can make a good choice. I saw on my phone what I was craving and he rushed to the back without even talking to me and said to the Cook (THERE IS A GUY WITH PICTURES HERE AND THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT BULLSHIT) 

I was really looking forward for the experience and spend another $50 but GARY's RUDENESS and His out of line comment was uncalled for. 

I got up and rushed to the CHEF AND TOLD HIM that I'm taking my BULLSHIT money elsewhere and GARY just stood there with a grin."}
{"text":"Alright.... Let me begin by saying that the food is super good. Great curry, pad Thai, soup, etc.

But I have to give this place Two stars because of one person that works there. 

He is tall, skinny, older but not old, and blond. He seemed okay when we came in, but after a bit, something seemed off about him. 

The waiter was a young man who was kind and very attentive. However, the blond guy up front kept harrassing him.
And not in a managerial sense either. Genuinely screaming, yelling and calling this poor kid names.

Then we heard him go back into the kitchen screaming about \"HOW MANY F*CKING TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THIS? ARE YOU F*CKING STUPID, DO THEY DO THIS IN THAILAND?\" I heard something hit the floor pretty hard in the kitchen and so I wondered if the crazy blond guy hit someone!

I have to tell you, this is no exaggeration on my part. 
The amazing meal my mom and I had was spoilt entirely by this crazy man abusing and berating the employees. 

In conclusion: Delicious food. But I feel so bad for those poor people being abused by the skinny blond dude up front that I simply cannot being myself to return and support that... :( 

Just awful."}
{"text":"The simple version is that the food is consistently tasty, but the prices are elevated for Verona. I would give a 3.5 if available. I would recommend sharing a few plates and grabbing some dumplings and fresh spring rolls at the restaurant or take out if you live in the area and don't feel like going further to the Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park. Also, the heat index is not very consistent, so mild heat lovers should aim low!"}
{"text":"The food here is out of this world! It's a nice atmosphere with fast and reliable service.  They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Small, quaint place. The Tom kha soup was delicious. The ambience is cute and cozy."}
{"text":"Our first time here today, and the food was excellent! Very friendly staff, and a nice little place to go for thai food."}
{"text":"Great food for mom n me. Two other restaurants were too busy around the holidays. Mom said my brother liked this place and since it was 7:30 .... Not much of a decision. 
     Mom got the Honey Chicken special. She's finishing the last pc. of chk. as I write this. They made her extra sauce when asked.  I could not finish my Yellow Chicken Curry.  It was very good but there was too much food! 
     Give this place a thumbs up and if I didn't live in NC, I'd be back soon."}
{"text":"After hearing many good things about this restaurant,  we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon at about 2:45. Upon entering the restaurant the hostess quickly grabbed menus and walked us to a table exclaiming \"We close at 3, so hurry up.\" Instead of being rudely rushed, we decided to leave. 

Yelp has the hours for this restaurant listed as open until 10 PM on Saturday - we aren't the type of people to walk into a restaurant as it is closing and demand service.

However,  the staff at Pittsburgh Thai need to understand that politeness goes a long way. We would have come back to try again had the message been delivered in a courteous manner.

Good food doesn't trump good manners, folks."}
{"text":"Thought this place was wonderful... However the last time we ate there we got take out, when I transferred my dinner onto a plate... I found a cockroach mixed in with my chicken and veggies. Very disappointed. We became regulars very fast after moving into the area, needless to say we have not returned."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I've tried so many different items on their menu and have never been disappointed! My favorite is probably the pumpkin curry- but everything is delicious!! Thankfully I live nearby, but well with the drive for those who aren't!"}
{"text":"Just had red curry and hot green tea.
Curry was perfect and the green tea was great for a cold day,
Bonus the Sever was Cute ;)"}
{"text":"Great Thai in Verona - who would have thunk it ! It is however true."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering takeout from Pittsburgh Thai since its opening. The staff is humble and friendly and the food is always prepared quickly and consistent. The noodle dishes are the prime pieces to the menu. Pad Thai, See Yew, and Spicy Noodles are some of the best in the city and suburbs of Pittsburgh. Thai by Boris stacks up against Noodlehead, Niki's, and Pusadees to name a few favorites. Haven't explored the menu much further because the noodle dishes are everything and you can swap chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, tofu and change up your spice level to keep things interesting."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Some of the best Thai food that I have ever had. The service was good and our waitress was really nice. Also, a big plus as always is that it is BYOB and their is no corking fee. My only gripe and it is a very little gripe is that they asked how spicy I wanted my food from 1 to 10 and I requested a 10. I would say that what I got was more along the lines of a 7 or 8 even for American standards. However, the food was still delicious and I will be going back there again."}
{"text":"Just stop by on my way home from work for a pick up order.   Two orders of drunken noodles with shrimp spicy level five.  Our favorite!. Great little place.  You can stop by and dine in. also it is BYOB.  We have eaten here multiple times and have never been disappointed with the menu.  Bring a friend and a bottle"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going back to this place. The pad Thai was the worst I ever had. The beef was sliced thick and was so tough it was inedible. I wish Nikki still owned it."}
{"text":"Such great service and food!

We were visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and staying in Monroeville.  Decided we wanted Thai food on a Thursday evening and checked out the options on Yelp.  Selected Boris' Thai restaurant and drove about 20 minutes to get there.

Pulled up and we were immediately seated.  Waiter was super friendly and we had a nice discussion with him about Thai culture and food.  We ordered our dishes and were also given complimentary Thai iced teas which were delicious.  We both ordered curries and were very happy with the taste and presentation.  

Would highly recommend and will eat here again given the opportunity."}
{"text":"This place recently changed ownership and the food is soooooooo delicious! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! Very authentic and perfectly seasoned. Coming from a very diverse city right outside of DC, I've had plenty of Thai food in my day but this restaurant is by far the top restaurant. The owner and employees were genuinely sweet and very helpful. Although everything we had was so good, definitely try the chicken skewers appetizer, the pumpkin curry and the Thai iced tea! 

Side note: Not sure why Yelp hasn't edited the name of this spot yet but it's called Burgh Thai"}
{"text":"I told my coworker I haven't had good authentic Thai food in a long time besides a place I go to in Regent Square and she recommended this restaurant. We got to-go orders & the woman at the register was pleasant until after we paid. After she rang us up she didn't offer us any soy sauce, napkins etc. and quickly walked away to clear tables. When my friend saw none of those items were in the bag we waited for her to come back. The phone rang so she came back about a minute later looked at us in a rude manner & answered the phone. After talking for a bit she looked at my coworker as though \"what do you want\", not bothering to ask the person on the phone to hold ask us if we needed something. My coworker asked for soy sauce & she literally acted as though she was irritated to reach in the drawer to get it for her. Mind you at no point were we rude to her in spite of how rude she was. After she gave it to her she immediately turned her back to us so we had wait a few moments for her to turn back around for me to tell her I also wanted soy sauce. Considering she may have just been having a bad day, I would go back one more time because the food was really good. But if that's what their service is regularly like I definitely would not continue to go there."}
{"text":"Delicious and expertly prepared! Textures of different and perfectly cooked vegetables wonderful. My spice level 7.5/10 has my lips pleasantly burning. Decor plain, but who cares?! Jungle curry will leave you the picture of health, spicy peanut stir fry makes any thought of Happy Family an embarrassment. Custard sticky rice like flan on sticky rice. Go here!"}
{"text":"Second visit and both have been great. The seafood dishes are great and the veggies are always plentiful and fresh. Really enjoyed the Larb Salad with chicken and chili lime dressing. The food is spicy so when they ask how hot you want it stay on the low end of your usual comfort range (1-10). It will be plenty spicy."}
{"text":"when in Pitt I always go to Pittsburgh Thai by Boris. Never disappointed. Fantastic pad thai.
Came back and had the crab rangoon as an appetizer. Thin wrapper makes it better than what I have near home. My new favorite with the pad thai."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, quick service and very nice people.  But didn't like the soup or the free wonton that went on top of all their food or understand why it was there.  Also DO NOT order from them through here!!! They DO NOT have a contract with them anymore and will not get your order but Eat24 will take your order and money.  I did get refunded but it was a pain in the butt and my food wasn't ready when I got there, so I had to wait 20 min when I got there instead of grabbing it and running."}
{"text":"I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times and every time have loved everything we have gotten. The crying tiger appetizer is one of our favs and as for entrees, we've tried the Rad Na, Beef Pad Prik, Pumpkin Curry, Duck Curry, Mango Fried Rice etc and have never been disappointed. The restaurant is small inside but the service is fabulous. The food is top notch at a reasonable price and it is BYOB with no cork fee. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Finding this place turned out to be a treat.. They have awesome food, very laid back ambience and great service.. My friend ordered Duck curry and I ordered Mango Chicken curry.. Both of the dishes came out delicious.. We both ordered dinner quantities and turned out to be a mistake, portions were huge! I'd definitely come back to try a few more very interesting options they have on their menu.. Great place!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came to this restaurant on one of the first Friday nights in spring with the temperature above 60 degrees. We expected the place to be busy, but when we got there it was just us. Such a shame because we both found our meals to be delicious. My friend got the Spicy Basil with chicken. I got the Jungle Curry with vegetables. I found the spices to be well balanced and the flavor robust. We started with samosas, which had great texture - thin and crispy on the outside, with a decent amount of peas and potato on the inside. 
The service was as it should be, considering we were the only ones there! The table was well-attended, the food came quickly and was hot when we got it. 
This place is worth a visit. I'll be going back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in the entire pittsburgh area. The owner is this very nice little old man who is just so passionate about his restaurant and the food and his customers. I went with my girlfriend because we wanted to try something new and we will definitely go back. I've already told everyone I know about it! The service was pretty fast when we went, I know other people have said it can be slow, but it is SO worth the wait. The only issue is that it's very, very small and thus seating can be tight or you'll have to wait, but I think it adds character to the place and if you like quaint little family run places this is perfect!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  The restaurant is small but the service is great and reasonable prices.  Best Pad Thai in the area."}
{"text":"Great service and food !
We had Panang Curry w/chicken YUM
Thai fried chicken w/fried rice YUM
Chicken Satay w/peanut sauce and it was the tastiest sauce I've had yet and the cucumber sauce YUM
Thai coleslaw TASTY!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend completely loved this place. Then we got takeout one night and it literally had a roach in it. Luckily my girlfriend did not eat it. Called and they admitted they had a problem. Do not eat here there is much better Thai in the city. I know the food tastes good but this place is simply not sanitary"}
{"text":"I am originally from Pittsburgh, but have lived in Chicago for the last 15 years. I was here visiting my mother & we drove by this restaurant and I told her we should try it sometime during my stay. She has not had much Thai food in her life, but she was willing to try it. 

I'm so glad we did and so is she! 

It's a very small place (maybe around 10 tables) and we were greeted by Gary. SUCH a very nice guy! Boris, the co-owner and chef, also came out a few times to chat and deliver some of our food. So sweet! You won't go for the ambiance (but it is cute inside); you'll be back for the food, though.

We started off by splitting an order of samosas. My mother had never had these (I've only had them in Indian restaurants), but she loved them. I did also. Very tasty, not spicy, they came with a lovely, sweet sauce (5 to an order).

We both had chicken pad thai. Gary asked about the spice level desired. I went with a 5 and my mother had a 1. Both of us were pleased. I like a medium amount of spice and Boris got it just right! The portion was very generous (I finished mine, my mother brought about a 1/3 of hers home) and quite tasty! The chicken was moist, the flavors just right. It was accompanied by a small salad with homemade dressing that was sweet & very tasty.

They both could not have been any nicer and were very accommodating. They do not offer delivery, but you can call ahead for take out. Boris said they do get busy on Fridays & Saturdays and I certainly hope they do; this place is a neighborhood gem and deserves to stay in business. My mother was very excited and said that she would be back. I told her that when I'm in town, we're definitely going back! SO GOOD!

The best part is that everything was so fresh! My biggest complaint is when you go to a restaurant and you get your order within minutes after you arrive! What that means is that it's been sitting around, staying warm until you come in. I'd much rather have it prepared fresh & that's exactly what you get when you come here!

I'll be back! 

P.S. They are closed from 3 - 5 (I'm not sure if that's every day or not) as that is when they do a lot of their prep work. Call ahead to make sure."}
{"text":"Well presented food, curry puffs were wonderful. Basil fried rice was the best.

No refills on coke 

The rangoons were not worth ordering at all. 
I drove out of my way to eat here.


Veggie spring rolls were very pretty.

The thom Kai soup disappointed in flavor and spice"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food in a nice little town on the river. The coconut soup was delivered to the table almost boiling hot, but once it cooled down it was great. I had the panang curry which was the perfect level of spicy without compromising the taste. I'll be eating here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm Thai and i would consider myself to be a Thai food snob.  This restaurant offers quick meal that very decent.   I have only tried Chili Thai fried rice, Ladd naa, spicy green bean.   My go to order is Chili fried rice.  It's just enough kick to make you sweat."}
{"text":"This is easily the best thai food in Pittsburgh. I wasn't sure what to expect because it is a tiny restaurant in an out of the way area.  But I suppose that those are sometimes the best culinary treats.

The dining room is tiny.  There were between six or eight tables.  They also had two tables outside on the \"patio\" overlooking the street.   When we entered, they asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't, but thankfully they had room for us.  We were in a corner next to the window which was nice because it gave us more space than some of the tables in the back near where the restrooms are.

We started with appetizers.  I had the thai toast and my husband the thom Kha soup.  The thai toast was seasoned perfectly and was a larger portion then you get at many places.  The cucumber sauce condiment was so tasty I asked for extra.  The Thom Kha was a perfect balance of spice and sweet and we liked it so much it was tempting to lick to bowl to get every last drop.

My husband had the drunken noodles and I had the pad thai (although it was tough to make a decision because everything seemed so appealing.  The food was cooked to perfection just to the desired spice level we requested.  The portions were large and there was a lot of meat.  

The service was attentive but not in your face.  They were accomodating to requests and kept our water glasses full.  

It is a BYOB restaurant, so if you like to drink wine with your meal, bring it along.

I loved our experience here and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The food is awesome here and the restaurant itself is very cute. There are always fresh flowers on the tables! Order the Thai iced tea. The one downside is the lack of spice I get in my food. I always order a 10 and it comes out as a 2. If you enjoy your Thai food spicy make sure to ask for the spices on the side as they will not add it in for you."}
{"text":"Thai food by a dude named Boris? I was skeptical. I love Thai food. Mediocre Thai food just saddens me. I was very very happy when I left Pittsburgh Thai by Boris. You go Boris! I love that they ask on a 10-point scale how spicy you would like your curry. I ordered a curry without coconut milk, which would have balanced the spice somewhat, so I went with 6. Next time, I might go with a 5. It was the Jungle Curry, with chicken and a ton of veggies - string beans, carrot, snow peas, cabbage, mushrooms. The steamed dumplings were great, too - light and fresh tasting, not the unfortunate gummy, heavy dumplings you see at some other places. The waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. The restaurant itself was small but clean and simply decorated. It's a gem. Don't ever close, Boris!"}
{"text":"There is a void in the Oakmont/Verona area in terms of Asian or Thai cuisine. Pittsburgh Thai by Boris has filled that void well, even though I wish we had more variety in the surrounding area.

Thai by Boris is a place I'm proud to have in my neighborhood. I have not eaten inside, but have ordered food to-go, and also done pickup. Service is usually prompt and polite. 

Once I went in to pick up food and the owner accidentally misrang my total as $3.00 instead of the $30.00 it should have been. When I pointed out the mistake, she was so gracious that she let me have free refills on Thai iced tea to sip outside while I waited for my carryout. The staff is honest and easy to talk to.

As for the food, I've only eaten one lackluater entree in my multiple visits. I was very underwhelmed by the tofu I had there; it was soggy and tasteless, with very little broth to surround it and the vegetables. BUT! Nearly everything else at Thai by Boris is authentic-tasting Thai. The pad thai is delightful and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"We arrived before 6pm, no crowded rush for a Saturday evening. Atmosphere was calm and quiet, relaxed. Great aromas of curry and spices. Excellent service. Ordered two perfectly delicious (and spiced to order!) entrees as well as two Thai iced teas and the fresh spring rolls. Totally a wonderful experience. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on the way to the airport after  finding this restaurant on Yelp. The food was fresh and delicious! No MSG which is really important for me. We had 2 different curries with vegetables as the side instead of rice. Everything was delicious and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"Crispy duck basil was delicious as was the spicy noodles with chicken... We also shared the spring roll combo and tom Kai soup! Always a favorite. It's always good, never too busy and fast."}
{"text":"Well what a pleasant surprise! I forgot to take pictures though so I really apologize for that. Went here tonight with my dad for dinner. Number one key: NO CORKING FEE. 
We were greeted by a super nice woman who was our waitress for the night. She was delightful. We both started with the Tom Yum soup mine at a 7 and my dad's at a 5. Both of which I think were accurate on the spicy level (i like it spicy). My only thing with the soup is the chicken chunks were almost too large. I wish they were cut a little more because I could barely eat one in a bite and cutting chicken in soup isn't the easiest. But it tasted fantastic! 

Then I had the red curry and he had the panang curry: Both very good and a good portion. I think it's a little pricier than other Thai places in the city I have been to but I have no complaints and I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I do allot of traveling to find great restaurants. Pittsburgh Thai is the very best and most authentic I've found anywhere! 
The food and service are definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great birthday dinner with a friend here. The company was as good as the food was delicious--Gary and Boris were both friendly and charming. Gary was hilarious. We had a wonderful time, and plan to return with friends."}
{"text":"There was a time when Pittsburgh Thai by Boris was owned by someone else. I will affectionately call those days the good days. The quality of food at Pittsburgh Thai is good! I personally enjoy the cashew chicken and the pumpkin curry! And yes, the quality is there, but the prices are high to me. Because of the old days...I used to receive the same quality food for cheaper. I almost always take out, and the price I pay now is around $15 per meal... hefty (around 40%-50% increase). I've been haunted by this ever since the switch occurred. 

Staff is friendly. You can pay with card. You can dine in (it's small but nice), and there's also a couple tables outside. Rumor is there might be a new buyer...and I hope the future lands us back at the price point we all would love. 

Should you try it? Yes. Especially if you live in Oakmont/Verona area (Thai dessert). But, I would stay in my neighborhood in different areas of the city to eat local Thai where the price points and qualities are better!"}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings and Seafood Birds Nest. The sauces are amazing! We will be back very soon ."}
{"text":"Wow! My taste buds are in love!

I wanted to be rid of my poor experience of Thai food the night before at a different Thai establishment and reclaim my love for Thai cusine so I headed here, a place I was none too keen on during my previous visit due to being ignored by my server.

This visit was a complete turn-around.  Service and food were great.

I started out with a salad with homemade pineapple dressing that my server recommended.  Exquisite and refreshing.

Then, I ordered the Yellow Mango Curry Chicken that I had my eye on during my previous visit but didn't get to. The presentation was quite lovely but OMG!  Seriously.  Not joshing.  I could have licked my plate.  Yellow curry may be my new found love.  All I know is that my taste buds were stilll craving the slightly sweet and spicy broth long after my meal was done (that's a good thing, BTW).  

The price was quite reasonable for lunch  -- $8.50 for the salad (you could opt for the soup instead) and curry chicken dish.  

I still want more....

P.S.  Thanks go out to a fellow yelper who said to give them another try!"}
{"text":"Thai by Boris is fantastic! We have been eating here for about two years now. Well prepared curries and pad tai. Owners are friendly and on the spot if your in a hurry. I turned my parents on to Thai. They love it so much they haven't been to Chinese in two years! Sometimes we hit Boris' twice in a week but definitely monthly. BYOB is a bonus to the exquisite food."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food!  I was happily surprised at how delicious everything we had was.  Also great mango sticky rice!  I was so happy to have found a really good Thai place in this area!"}
{"text":"Boris is the owner/chef in the kitchen and kwan the server was welcoming and friendly.  I live in the bay area,  CA and so have high expectations for thai food.  i was pleasantly surprised to the degree of how good this food was.  Pittsburgh residents should feel lucky to have this gem in their neighborhood.  definitely coming back to eat here for the rest of my visit."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were around the corner at Dirty Harry's one Tuesday afternoon when we began to feel a bit peckish.  The staff at DH quickly directed us to Pittsburgh Thai. We walked in and were quickly seated by a friendly server.  The place is small.  It only has around ten tables, but the atmosphere is very pleasant.  Fresh flowers can be found on each tabletop. 

After perusing the menu for a bit, I chose the panang curry and boyfriend opted for the fish basil entree.  Shortly after we placed our orders, we were given bowls of simple chicken soup and a single crab rangoon.  Both were very tasty. 

Our lunches arrived shortly thereafter. The (chicken) panang was delicious and cooked with fresh broccoli, bell peppers, and other vegetables.  Boyfriend's fish was crispy and flavorful and served in a delicious spicy basil sauce. 

We found out that for dinner hours, this restaurant is BYOB with no corking fee. Fantastic. 

Albeit small, Pittsburgh Thai has a lot of flavorful food for decent prices.  We will return."}
{"text":"Good food good service. I order the drunken noodles and Tom Kach soup the most. They are generous and friendly. Always easy to order and fast. You will find your favorite dish on their menu too! Enjoy!"}
