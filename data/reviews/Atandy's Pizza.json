{"text":"I wish I could write a good review but I gotta be honest. I only went to Atandys because we had a Groupon deal.  I figured try it, hopefully its good and we'll go back.  There are not many pizza joints in Vegas that are good, few and far between.  We ordered take out, and it was ready when we got there, so thats a plus.  The owner helped us, not very personable.  Place was hot as crap, decor was meh...its a quickee pizza place so whatever on that.  Got home ate.  Pizza, horrible.  Really not one good thing I can say about it.  It just wasn't good, probably one of the worst I've had, I've made better pizza.  The garlic knots were ok, probably would've been better hot, as they were slightly cooler than warm.  The wings were a plus, very good and the sauce(hot) was good.  It wasn't your typical Franks Red Hot or even Tabasco, not sure what it was but again very good.  I guess they have a good amount of sauces to try.  I may order from Atandys again, but keep it to the wings as they have 12 for $5.95, thats pretty good.  I was hoping they'd be good but it wasn't, I hope the best for him but sadly I see it as another place that will go away as soon as they came."}
{"text":"I've picked up food from Atandy's twice now and I know I'll be back! The service is fast and both times, the guy who was working (I think he's the owner) was very sweet & friendly!

The pizza itself was thin, soft and foldable, like New York style pizza but the slices aren't as large. They don't skimp you on sauce, cheese or toppings either-- you definitely get enough in each bite! On the BBQ chicken pizza, Atandy's uses a barbecue sauce flavor that most other BBQ chicken pizzas don't use. I don't know what it is, it wasn't my favorite, but it was still good.

The wings are delicious! I certainly wouldn't say they're on the small side as another reviewer previously posted. They are definitely larger than the wings you get at Buffalo Wild Wings, but they are a little overcooked for my liking (too crispy on the edges!) They have somewhere around 12 different sauces for their wings. So far I've had the medium, mild, and mango habanero. The medium was delicious with a much more complex flavor than standard buffalo sauce! The mild was way too plain and almost tasted like bare wings. The mango habanero is NOT like the mango habanero at Buffalo Wild Wings; it's more like a spicy barbecue sauce but it's still tasty, just not nearly as spicy as I expected.

Overall, I'd recommend Atandy's. It is definitely somewhere I'd pick up a quick weeknight dinner now and then. I checked out the menu on their website and it looks incomplete compared to what they actually have. And by looking at the online menu, it looks like the pizza can get pretty expensive as you add toppings (at regular price), but as long as they have specials going on for their pizza & wings, then price is definitely right!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Im not lying at all when I say this is the best pizza in las vegas! I ordered spicy garlic wings and a large pepperoni pizza. waiting time was reasonable. Wings were very fresh and had alot of meat on them. The pizza was cooked perfectly. I loved it. I got a free drink as well. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Went only because we had a groupon.  They're located in North Las Vegas and it was close to my house, so I bought the groupon.  After awhile trying to find the place (hole in the wall, hidden from the street) we finally pulled up to the front.  We had called earlier to make a reservation (I know right...a reservation at a take out pizza joint???)  and the lady hung up on us.  I guess we went at the wrong time! They only let a certain amount of groupon people in a day.  I didn't understand!  I had to come at a specific time to redeem it???? If you can't handle the customers, don't put out a deal on groupon.  Anyways.  We felt like we were bothering them by being there.  There was no one in the restaurant! It was extremely hot and uncomfortable.  They said they would try to get our food to us in an hour.  We were extremely confused.  

Garlic knots came and were delicious! four stars for the garlic knots!

Wings came....HORRID! They were COLD! And the sauce didn't taste like anything.  No spice...nothing.  My favorite food is wings!

Pizza came....It was not a restaurant pizza.  The crust looked like it was from the freezer.  I never saw them make anything.

We were scared to ask for napkins!  That's how unfriendly they are!
There was a nice older lady there that was friendly but seemed confused as to what was going on.  Whenever she tried to do something nice the man cooking would say no!

After feeling embarrassed and kind of alienated as a customer, I WILL NEVER BE BACK!"}
