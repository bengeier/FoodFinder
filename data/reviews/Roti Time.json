{"text":"Big fan of the food.  Regular customer.  Went in the other day, stood there, looked around, called hello, waited and waited,  nobody ever showed up.  Left.  Hungry.     Call first."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive (like $13) but the butter chicken roti is beyond delicious. Word to Vishnu."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. We've tried rotis from other places but always come back here. Big portions, great seasoning, and efficient service. In fact, we always call 15 minutes before going to pick it up, and it's ready when we arrive. Friendly staff too. I get butter chicken roti every time, hubby gets lamb roti... we both are happy with them."}
{"text":"Better than Ghandi. That's all I need to say here I think.   Order take out... You'll be back again next week."}
{"text":"It's 5 min away from home. Love it. My go to place when I get my cravings mmmmmmmmmmmm lol"}
{"text":"Roti time is awesome if you're looking for something delicious and cheap.  Amazing prices, huge portion and lots of flavour.  The \"spicy\" is extremely spicy, so watch out.  I usually like things really spicy and have to go with medium from here."}
{"text":"Mighty good, big portions, and freshly made. Just get take out, not much to look at. Simple operation in the kitchen, wait times could be problematic. Don't be in a rush, and call it in ahead. After going here a few times, I wanted to add how amazing their rotis are! I love the sag peneer roti and mali kafka roti. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The goat, butter chicken and channa roti here is really good. Is it the best in the city? No, but if you're in the area and feel like Indian roti its worth a try. Be warned if you can't handle spice then ask for mild or medium. Also, the place inside is very dirty. Needs a major deep clean!!"}
{"text":"The food here tastes great, but it is cooked with too much oil.   That explains why the dish stays hot for several hours after it is cooked.    I ordered the spinach and potato roti and paid extra to have eggplant inside as well.  I thought that it would be healtier to have more vegetables, but I was wrong.    I will order from here again, but I will not do it often because I am cautious about unheathy foods."}
{"text":"Good portion, good spice, good flavour, good value!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here May 5th 2012. Awesome butter chicken roti, almost as good as Mother India on Queen West [that's the gold standard to me]. Chana roti was tasty but the chickpeas were still somewhat al dente, so just OK - but qualified because I was the first customer on Saturday at noon so maybe the chana didn't have time to cook? Anyway a solid roti place [if somewhat oily] and a asset to the neighborhood - very glad I don't have to go to Parkdale to get roti."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but there was a lot of things holding me back.  -This place was not the prettiest on the inside. -Flavours just weren't there!  -My roti was very bland. -Price was not worth the food."}
{"text":"Easily the best roti to be had in Toronto. Price is right too! Simply can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Ordered a whole spread for a group of us for takeaway.   They claim to make Indian food. They do not.   Every meal plate was 90% rice, 10% order. Told me it would be 45 minutes to ready... Took just shy of two hours, not to mention luke warm upon arrival.   Food was bland. Wouldn't save it for leftovers - and I love leftovers.   Total disappointment, would find it very hard to go back."}
{"text":"I had my second visit to this place and it was one to talk about.   First off when ordering,  prepare to wait 20+ minutes.   The most recent time I ordered paneer with roti.   I thought we would get a decent sized curry as the order came wrapped with the paneer.   Once I opened the roti I noticed they give 5 small pieces of paneer with a heap of undercooked peas in curry as a filler. All this for $ 9.95.   For those people who have never had curry or roti,  you may not notice.   But this place deserves one and a half a star,  but I gave it a two as I didn't go prey to the porcelain God's. Makes me wonder if people who reviewed this place actually know the taste of curry."}
{"text":"Their prices have risen, their portions have decreased and they microwaved the rice. It's a shame really, this place used to be a great little unpretentious local spot. Now it's just another roti restaurant destined to be closed within 6mo."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious and huge portions. Haven't had anything non-veg but the veg rotis are top notch!  Try the saag paneer!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Although the portion sizes are decreasing the flavor is still there.  The spicy butter chicken talks back to me with every bite. Service is slow but that's just the nature of the place, prepare to wait or call ahead.  Employees are super kind and the food is still worth the price."}
{"text":"Awesome Roti! Have been ordering takeout for years! We often get it when we have guests over and have turned many people into fans and regular customers. My favourites are the mutter paneer the saag paneer and lamb but everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"I too am a Ghandi's veteran and found Roti Time to be a little disappointing. It's very hard for me to say that... I mean the food was great... it's just that once you've had the original Gandhi's, it's hard to hold a candle to them so to speak.  The innards were \"pastier\" than Gandhi's, not as rich and tangy as I'm used to. Also, I found the roti shell to be overcooked and dry, not pliable and moist as it is at the parent location.  I'll still go back to get my weekend roti fix."}
{"text":"Take a quick look at yer skin color right quick cuz this ain't no wing place, it's a Roti shop boy. Belieee dat.   Whatever you decide to order lemme talk to ya, mainly to you white folk - please please be careful on what kinda hotness level you choose, this ain't wing toppings, it's straight up spice and when they tell you it going to be spicy; that's brown for multiply that by three.   If you experienced Roti and brown food then this place will bring you home. It's straight outta the south (asia).    Uneducated folks start googlin'. The chickens spiced deliciously, God dam. The breas cooked up to par and toasted as perfect as can be. When you open up the Roti you got the korma lookin' mixed with butter tastin and if you brave enough, spicy flakin (I know.. I'm a loser)  but seriously they mix It up with potatoes as well and cook it very evenly.   Now here's the problem.. There's way too much korma or butter or whatever they mixed to make the tastey goo, slim that down a bit and it be perfect.   Next problem... Unless you're going in at lunch.. A Roti gonna cost a brotha 14$ and add another 3 if you want rice. I ain't complaining about portion size cuz it's dam good amount but this is considered fast food Indian style so charging 14$ is robbery which is why if you step into this place at night it's lookin like the real Sahara.   Momma approves but her bank account don't. Awesome tastin place tho."}
{"text":"After driving by this place for the last two years, I had a roti craving and needed to satiate that and my curiosity. Thanks to these Yelp reviews I decided to try Roti Time. I am so glad I did! My experience was consistent with previous reviews.  The place is plain inside, but clean. The smell inside this place really got my taste buds excited... the wait for food might be welcomed by some!  The order process wasn't clear, however. I called in my order and don't recall hearing an order number but upon arriving people were quoting theirs. So be prepared when calling in...  I ordered just the butter chicken roti and it was fantastic! I have not stopped thinking about it :) I was pleased to find that it didnt have too many potatoes and would call the mix 'just right'. Give this place a try and enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening when there is no any other customers, yet they still managed to take approx 40 minutes to prepare our order - one simple butter chicken roti. Food is absolutely mediocre, portion is normal, the quality of food and long wait definitely do not justify the price."}
{"text":"This is not only our local roti place, but one of the best in the city. The roti bread is so good and unlike anything you'll have anywhere else. I'd definitely recommend a butter chicken roti for your first time, but their selection is A++   Love this place"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a number of times in the past. I loved their samosas (when they had them) and their mutter paneer roti. However, we ordered once about two months ago and we had to throw it out it was so bad. We tried it again last month, thinking it was just a bad day. Again, it wasn't the same as it used to be. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we tried once more last weekend. We placed our order at 7:00pm- again they had no samosas, but that was expected- at. 7:45 when our food was still not ready, we told them we wouldn't be returning. It's a shame, we used to love their roti but definitely not worth the wait and sick of them not having items in their menu."}
{"text":"I've never had better Roti in my life! The saag paneer is absolutely amazing! You don't go there for the aesthetic, you go there for the food plain and simple.  If you want to take a trip to flavour country, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Spectaular food, inexpensive, this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This Roti place makes very spicy Rotis... make sure to tell them you need extra extra extra spicy for it to come hot enough. Once you order it this way a few times they will trust you can handle it they'll give you the full spice level."}
{"text":"The food here is good, got the butter Chicken roti.  The service is slow and when you order food it takes forever, so call in advance."}
{"text":"One evening a few months ago i felt like taking a longer detour home to maybe explore the neighborhood a lil bit. Just as i passed by this place I was hit with an invisible force of fragrant spices coming out of this corner street establishment. I continued walking and was about a block away and the aroma was still lingering in the air and, I no longer had the ability to keep walking away so I turned back and walked in to the resto.   Since then I've been here 4 times: the first time was a little bit too spicy and oily for me but that's just personal preference. The last time I went I asked for mild spice and less oil and it was bang on. I still get craving pangs for The vegetarian cauliflower which is my favorite so far.  Do check this place out. It is sort of a dive so don't expect designer decor."}
{"text":"Delicious, down to earth, straight forward roti! I've lost count how many times I've ordered from this place and it has never failed to deliver outstanding roti bursting with flavor that do even better the next day. I've never eaten inside as I always order via Uber eats or call in advance for take out (make sure to call to avoid possible wait times).   It's a humble little family joint, but seriously their rôtis are amazing. My go to orders are the malai kofta, butter chicken, saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, and occasionally ill order the mutter paneer or lamb rôtis.   The malai kofta takes around 40-45 minutes but it's soooooo worth it. It's got an incredible spicy, subtly sweet, tangy kick. The butter chicken is one of the best in the city. There's always plump, large pieces of chicken in an amazing butter sauce! Chicken Tikka masala is also bursting with flavor! All their rôtis are generously portioned, piping hot, and super flavorful, but those three are a must try! The roti bread themselves are very well done, too. I noticed they are always cooked through, fresh, firm, and warm - so it's really great cutting into them and revealing the curries inside. I've had rôtis that were undercooked and it takes away from the meal so much, but these are always perfect! A must try if you're around or passing by this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"the food is always great!, lots of vegetarian options, try the cauliflowers and potato... also their samosas are the best i've ever had !!! the owner is so sweet she always comes out of the kitchen to say hi  it's worth the trip, great food, huge portions, and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"This location was suggested by a friend who used to order from there all the time. Picked up 2 butter chicken roti and one butter chicken and rice. Prices had gone up quite a bit from last year, butter chicken roti now $13.95 and butter chicken with rice $14.95.  Got back to work excited to eat and when roti opened it was only half full. So disappointing! We called the restaurant and instead of offering any kind of explaination we were told that the amount is always the same in the rotis. And that's that. Again so disappointing. Flavour is wonderful but with extremely small portions at a high price and a lack of concern for their customers experience this will be the first and last time I go there."}
{"text":"When my friend and I got there around lunch time, there was a group of guys have been waiting for a while. We waited for the lady who is a cashier/chef. She didn't seem happy and was very rude to customers. We understand that she was all by herself, at least she could be nice about it and apologize to people about the an hour wait. She kept taking more orders as people walked in and telling them it's half hour wait, but just couldn't keep up with it. Very few people in there, we all have to wait for an hour to get take out. A customer was kind of pissed off. During lunch time, this is not acceptable.   The place is very sketchy. As for food, it's ok. Not worth it waiting for. There are better Roti places. We will not go back for sure."}
{"text":"\"Hearty, tasty, down to earth, consistent!\"  Found this little place because a trip to a bike shop nearby. Turns out they have the best roti I've had so far! Eggplant, mixed veg, your choice of fillings inside yummy roti pouch.  The place is quite big with tables. But most people seem to be picking up their food. Not your place if you care about the dining atmosphere as it is quite simple, not the nice kind of simple. When they cook, the smoke comes into the dining area. But we don't care, the taste and value matters when it comes to restaurants for us.  Their spicy is pretty spicy! The portion is very generous given the $8-10 dollar price range. And this is the case every time so far."}
{"text":"Ok so we go here all the time now and it's as consistent and good as Gandhi's/Mother India. Fantastic stuff and they've ironed out all the kinks."}
{"text":"They used to be on par with Gandhis but the new owners are not the same.  Not that its bad just not nearly as good as Gandhis.  Worth a visit but if you want the real deal go downtown."}
{"text":"Yummy. Very tasty. I tried the butter chicken and my wife the one with spinach and cheese. Quick too. Will go back, for sure."}
{"text":"Place looks good from outside, but is more of a dive inside. It doesn't look the cleanest, but not dirty either. Ordered the tikka massala roti and eggplant roti with a pakora on the side. It was served to go although we had intended to stay. The guy said I told him it was to go, but I never mentioned it. He did accommodate us by giving us some utensils and a pitcher of water. The pakora was quite dry. It didn't matter how much chutney I used, it feels like I was eating a powdery cookie. Both roti was pretty good. Not much meat on the tikka massala chicken and the sauce was quite hot even though I ordered medium, but the roti itself was great. The crepe like texture  made it amazing to bite into. Overall, I don't think it is anything special. Further to that, the previous reviewer was right... They take a while to prepare which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I should have ordered ahead of time.  Update: we had had left over from this visit and had them the next day. The food is like KFC. It was better the day after. My Gf thought the same.  I think the roti absorbed some of the liquid which made the texture and taste much better. It also wasn't too hot like when it is served fresh."}
{"text":"Unassuming little place in a WalMart neighbourhood - but what great Roti!  My favourite roti place in the city."}
{"text":"Came here at 2 pm and had to wait about 20 mins for a spicy chicken roti.   Was it worth it?  I believe so. Now, I took the roti to go, so I don't have much to say in regards to the location for a sit-down meal. What I can say, is that the place is small. Really small. The staff is pretty good, as in the one guy behind the counter that took my order, and the place was clean (which is always good for a restaurant).   Now, the question is, will I go back. Answer, yes, just not anytime soon. The Chicken Roti ended up costing me about $12. It was worth it, just a little too expensive for a quick lunch outing. But, I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Just like Ghandi's downtown but way more seating area, cleaner and right in my neighborhood! We were the first to arrive sunday(open only from 6-8pm) and took about 15mins for our food. Right after our order the phone calls and customers rushed in. Small business but good, affordable food. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This is the best Roti in the city.  Some people will tell you Ghadhi's is better, but they you realize they're all owned by the same family and it makes sense why they're equally delicious.  At about $10 bucks each, they're not priced to move, but they're totally priced fairly.  You get a good about of food for a fair price.    If you've followed any of my reviews, you've discovered that price plays a huge part in how I give out my stars.  For me to think, \"this isn't a super deal, but my word would I return,\" that's saying something.  If I was feeling a Roti, there's no other place I would go!"}
{"text":"LOVE roti time! They make a truly awesome roti using nice plump pieces of chicken breast. I have nothing against the traditional Caribbean yellow curry Roti, however I find the Indian flavours such as butter chicken or chicken korma much much tastier!   If you are thinking of taking out it does take a while to make, so ordering in advance is a good idea."}
{"text":"Regarding my experience a few years ago, while this restaurant was named Gandhi Roti: After finding out about an Indian restaurant in our neighborhood, my family was very excited and we had high expectations. Sadly, our experience fell way short of our expectations. We ordered a bunch of curries (chicken korma, butter chicken etc.) and they all had very little meat and too much potato.  We were also disappointed to hear that rice had to be order separately and did not come with the curries. My brother also got food poisoning after eating here on that occasion. So no more Gandhi Roti/Roti Time for us."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to place as I've been going here for many years.   The management of this establishment does not want any help during lunch rush hour, many times I go for lunch I have to wait almost 1hr for a roti. It's good to call ahead and order. The portion is much smaller now compare to many years ago(5-6). Price has risen as well for every roti on the menu. There's only a few pieces of chicken and fewer potatoes. I am disappointed, this use to be my place for roti.   The place is pretty outdated, they need a good updating.   It taste good and smells good, but I'm not full at the end and have to go get fast food."}
{"text":"My favourite Roti other than Gandhi on Queen St. West. When I say hot though it could be hotter!"}
{"text":"I don't know how they do it but somehow they make the best roti.   I've gotten the butter chicken and the chicken tika, generally I prefer the butter chicken. I usually get it in a roti style were as the rest of my family likes it with rice. It is nice to have the option. The only downside in my opinion about their roti is that I find there is a little to much potatoes for my liking but it is defiantly tolerable."}
{"text":"When we can't make it down to Queen West for Gandhi's rotis, we swing by here.  I think the story is that the owners of Roti Time were trained by the Gandhi guys so the food is quite on par.  I always get the same thing - mattar paneer roti ($10).  As I watch them pour the cream to make the sauce, I'm sure that one roti probably has the calorie equivalent of 5 Big Macs so I can just hear myself getting fatter.  The roti is large and I can only eat about 1/2 in one sitting.  It's stuffed with plenty of peas and cubes of cheese.  We usually grab our food to go but there is a small dining room.  Plenty of parking near by on the residential streets and in the Walmart parking lot across the street."}
{"text":"Roti Time is another west-end take out option that satisfies my need for flavour while sitting on my couch.  Much like gandhi roti downtown, Roti Time delivers gigantic roti filled with classic indian dishes like spinach paneer or butter chicken. The roti are good, but they are so gigantic and rich that I find it best to order a few kinds and share so you don't get butter chicken overload. Overall, a yummy roti worth trying."}
{"text":"Butter chicken roti hands down is the best!  I also enjoyed their mango lassi too. Their veggie pekora was a little burnt but tasted delish nonetheless.  It's located at a location that turns into a one way so you might have to make a U-Turn depending where you're coming from.  Also, if you're going order for take out call earlier as they take a bit of time to prepare and you can run errands at the Wal-Mart across the road :)"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place but the food is delicious and  the portions are huge.  They also have a great selection of different flavours.  This is a real treat!"}
{"text":"Well I've been ordering here for a while now and I personally love the butter chicken. The prices are pretty high but the food is kind of \"meh\" for what you are paying for. BUT the last time I ordered there, my mom, brother and I decided to eat there. We ordered two dishes, the butter chicken, and a roti. First, we were ordering at the counter, and the phone would ring and the guy would spend massive times on the phone, not talking to a customer. Second, he wasnt very friendly, he seemed clueless and tired. We came there expecting to take less than an hour to eat. But it took over a half an hour to get our food! It was empty at the time and the kitchen was quiet. Having this much time to sit, bored, I noticed that the place is super out dated and old. But besides all that, I give 5 stars for the food and 1 star for service, I recomend calling and eating at home."}
{"text":"So. I don't know if it is fair to give this resto a 5 star review since I have never been there. I ordered this food delivery. So the review is for the food alone. No idea what the actual physical restaurant is like (according to other reviews the ambiance may leave something to be desired).  I am, however, having a love affair with this roti.  Butter chicken. Added paneer. Mango chutney on the side.   This roti has a delicious flavour. It is spicy but not painful. The texture is amazing - not a sloppy drippy mess (which we've all had) but rather a robust roti that is flaky and chewy and a creamy filling with giant chunks of chicken, paneer and the occasional hunk of potato.   The roti is like a thin naan. I have had other roti that were more like a very thin cornmeal pancake. This is not that. It's like a chewy thin naan baked over high heat.   The meal was huge. If I had been moderate i could have eaten it over two nights. I ate it all at once.   I saw a number of comments on google about the price. I paid $24 for my meal including taxes and tip. Is this expensive for roti? Yes. Is it worth it? Definitely."}
