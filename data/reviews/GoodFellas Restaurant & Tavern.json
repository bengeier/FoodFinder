{"text":"For some reason we'd driven past GoodFellas daily ever since it opened but only recently made our way in. Since visiting this GoodFellas last week, we've already been back. We LOVE this place. It checks all the boxes for us. It is smoke-free which I love. BUT, we also have friends who smoke. Fret not! there is an indoor smoking area for them which I sincerely appreciate! And it's located so far from the bar that you can't smell it at all. The food is awesome. In a time when bone marrow entrees have replaced any vegetarian options, this place has stood it's ground. There are a wide variety of options for carnivores but I can't remember the last time I had so many selections as a vegetarian. There are TWO vegetarian burgers, a few eggplant dishes, pizza, grilled cheese and a few other things I can't remember. It seems too good to be true! The two dishes I've tried so far (Quinoa burger and eggplant hoagie) have been delicious! There's a solid beer selection, standards like Miller, Labatt, etc. but also a decent selection of craft beers (Full Pint, Green Flash, Rogue, Fat Heads, Etc.). All the beer is reasonably priced. The scene is pretty solid. Lots of locals. Look forward to getting to know some of them. Some of the guys seem like total riffraff but you'll get that anywhere. Anyways, overall, can't recommend this place enough. Looking forward to many, many future visits. Oh and the women's bathroom is the best I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood pub with YUGE wings that are really amazingly good. I wasn't a fan of the burger, but the fries were excellent and the steak sandwich is rockin'! The bar looks sketchy from the outside, but the inside is comfortable and casual. There are lots of big screen televisions and a jukebox. Fortunately, it's not outrageously loud. I do wish the draft beer selection was better and that the wine was better quality. But, overall, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice clean upscale setting although very limited beer tap selection. Plenty flat screens plus attentive servers, convenient location.
Owner has cook who seems not the ability to complete a decent experience with regard to chicken wings selection of menu.
What good does it do if you procure big wings if you know nothing Further? For example great sized wings, but once you ask for mild you get
Hot wings instead. Only to add insult to injury by supplying watered down Bleu cheese dressing, so much so it will not stick to wing.
After having voiced my concerns I was told that the cook gets emotional when a patron questions their product, so please don't mention it.
It would be wise for the establishment to release the present pretender and hire on one who at the very minimum understands but is willing to
Perform kitchen duties at a basal level where they actually are a success at such an unchallenged obligation."}
{"text":"Best service around with the most friendly bar staff and clientele. I love it here in swissvale!!"}
{"text":"The change to the bar is amazing! The menu is constantly changing with a great variety of home made foods. The owners are so friendly and give personal attention to each patron. For those who don't want to eat in the bar environment, you can sit in the seperate dining area. Stop down to Goodfella's for a great meal and drink at good prices in a welcoming environment."}
{"text":"My wife really liked the the steak hoagie (the \"PhillyFella\").  I have found a new favorite wings place!  Full, meaty wings.  Several different sauces, but I love the regular barbecue.  Nice folks.  If you are very sensitive, there is still a LITTLE smoke smell, though the smoking is in a closed off room.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"My family and I was there last night for new years and we had a wonderful time.  The bartender and the people were nice and inviting.  My husband and I do not live far from this place so we will be coming back.  Thank you for a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and stopped in for the first time last night. Here is the scoop.  What a great spot. Lots of big televisions, air conditioning, non smoking, great service(Peyton) & parking. The best part was the great bar food( anyone who lives over there knows there is a lack of good bar eats... I had loaded Tator  tots( great) also antipasta calazone ( great also). I recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times and have never been disappointed. This is a local tavern with good food, can tell some of food is homemade. Great wedding soup, loaded tater tots are tasty, also loved the pierogies and beans and greens. I have also tried the Italian grilled cheese which was great. Great place for good bar food. I believe they sometimes have specials."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade food!!! Nice atmosphere! Great owners! Nightly food specials, delicious homemade soups!  Attentive servers, nice bar area, accomidating smokers area"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked to go to for when I was in the area. It has a 4 1/2 star rating. Today we were in the area and decided to check it out. Bad decision. 
When we walked in there was no one in the dining room and maybe 3 people at the bar. The bartender was a very friendly woman. She was very welcoming. She told us all about the specials. The restaurant was updated and clean. We were off to a great start. Then we ordered. We waited. . . . and waited. . . and waited . . . And waited for our food. The bar became full and people were seated in the restaurant. And still we waited. It took us over THIRTY MINUTES to get our lunch. We were starving!!!  Our orders were simple-a fish sandwich with coleslaw and a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with tater tots. Nothing special. Items that they make every day. Yet the wait was outrageous. One of the two cooks even came out of the kitchen and sat at the bar and had a beer. I guess cooking the food of the patrons wasn't a priority to him. IF the food was outstanding. . . It's a smidge better but  this food was barely average and they messed up my husband's sandwich. The bartender asked if he wanted it grilled or fried. He said grilled. It came out fried. The sauce was sweet, not hot. My fish sandwich was long and appeared to be huge. Instead the fish was very thin and you were mostly eating bread. 
No. Nope. Nada. Never again."}
{"text":"5/5

This place has a hometown feel that you just cannot replicate at any chain restaurant. 

The food is all cooked fresh daily and out of the tens of times that I've been here, I have yet to be disappointed. You also cannot be disappointed with price, you'll pop before you're wallet empties. 

If you want a local bar that has a great domestic beer selection, home cooking, and is run by kind/honest local folks; look no further. 

I will absolutely be back and would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to watch the game or grab a delicious bite to eat."}
{"text":"Best bar in Swissvale. Tons of space in both the bar and dining room (and a separate smoking area behind a glass door, can't smell it anywhere). Beer is super cheap, solid selection, and the specials during Pens and Steelers games on Miller Lite are great. Dollar off drinks during happy hour too. 

But the food! Man it's good. The pizza is great, the crust is the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Tons of veggie options. Homemade chips are killer with their honey mustard. 

Love that they have trivial pursuit cards on the bar. AMI jukebox. Tons of parking. Good TV's.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place prior to my visit and I'll say I was pleasantly surprised.
It's a neighborhood bar that serves food. Though we didn't eat, the regulars raves about it.
The place is clean and fun and though some may classify it as a dive I just say neighborhood bar.
Prices were super affordable. The bartenders friendly and the patrons just as nice."}
{"text":"After being turned away from the nearby Firehall fish fry, we decided to satisfy our fish cravings at GoodFellas.  We ordered the (Lent special) fish sandwich and the fried butterflied shrimp and hushpuppies to share.  

Everything was hot, and the hushpuppies had a delightfully crispy crust with a good cornmeal flavor and texture.  The shrimp batter was light and crunchy, while the shrimp were tender and moist.   The fish sandwich was standard but executed well.

Service in the bar area was quick and friendly, but the draft options were limited--only six taps, and none with an IPA. 

We look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"I held off on reviewing because I think it's only fair on a new place. 

I've been here a number of times for both lunch and dinner. Bar food is typically something I eat because I'm already in a bar, probably drunk, and can't be assed to leave for food.  This is a definite step up from that! I'll go there to eat even if I'm not drinking. (Hypothetically speaking)

I haven't tried everything but have really liked pierogies, meatloaf, Italian hoagie, and burgers. It's home style food, don't look for anything with a name you can't pronounce. Everything they make is delicious."}
