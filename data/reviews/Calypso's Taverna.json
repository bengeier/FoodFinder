{"text":"Took the road trip from the SE to Calypso's to celebrate a birthday. Don't know who's, but I am sure someone was born on Feb 18th. Anyway, our crew of 5 was seated for lunch. The Calypso offers a specific lunch menu and daily specials averaging 15 bucks a dish.  After having a few Mythos brews, we placed our orders. Saganaki and calamari for appies and then the mains. I had the  Kleftiko, two of our dudes had the pork chop special and the other two went with a salmon and a souvlaki respectively.  The Saganaki was very good and the Calamari was lightly battered and crisp and delish as well. As we mowed through the appies I noticed the decor represented some of the best highlights of Greece. Adjacent to the restaurant area is a small lounge area.  The mains showed up and by all accounts the meals were satisfying. My lamb dish was tender and flavourful. The lemon potato was fabulous. Sampled the grilled mushrooms from the pork chop special and they were very tasty.  A couple more Mythos and we were out the door. All in, a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!  Went here for a celebration dinner and it was excellent!  The service was very friendly, and the food was amazing.  If you order the appetizer platter for two ($30) you will be full! Between four of us, we had that, the saganaki, and main courses. 3 of the main courses came with soup or salad. It was sooo delicious and I could barely eat it after the appetizer and saganaki. The saganaki (cheese doused and set a flame, served with pita and an Opa!) was to die for. It didn't taste healthy by any means, but it was cheesy heaven. If you've never ordered it before then do it. The appetizer platter came with meatballs in a tomato sauce, spanakopita, calamari, tzatziki, pita, and there may have been something else. So good, and between two people would probably be enough.   The inside of the restaurant is cozy and relaxing. All the food was received very well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Calypso's as we wanted to try a restaurant in the neighbourhood that we hadn't been to before. The place was pretty much deserted, but the interior looked nice. We were seated in a booth that was quite comfortable. We ordered the calamari appetizer, and I thought it was tasty, offering good value. However, when we received our mains, we were disappointed. My wife's salmon was bland and so was the rice. I was looking forward to my lamb dish, but it had a boiled texture with not much flavour. Very disappointing. The potato had an odd sour taste; it seemed like it had been soaked in lemon juice.  Added to this, there was no beer on tap, or any drink specials.  The service was brusque... it seemed like the server didn't care if the customers liked the food or not. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Calamari was amazing! Roast lamb was delicious~ best in Calgary area (wish the tzatziki sauce came with the meal). Wanted to try the ek mek but was so full! Will definitely come back for it!"}
{"text":"A work colleague suggested we check out this resto because we love Greek food.  We stopped in on a Friday night after work before heading to a movie.  We heard the portions were huge, so we avoided ordering appetizers.  My husband had the kleftiko with a Greek salad side.  The lamb (kleftiko) was delicious, probably the best I've tasted.  The salad and other sides were average.  My husband's version of Greek salad is tastier.  I ordered the spanakopita. It was fantastic - even better than the one I make myself. It had a great flavour.  The only downside is that it seemed to have been reheated, not made 'fresh'.  I had the lemon rice soup, avoglemono, which came with the meal.  It was good, with big chunks of chicken, but I missed the lemony tang I expected, and I felt it was not enough flavour for me and it had a bit too much rice, which I didn't finish.  The roasted potatoes were good as well, but not enough lemon flavour for my palate.  I agree with other reviewers, the entree veggies are not good enough for a restaurant meal. My green beans tasted over-cooked and tough at the same time, and were bland.  We didn't order anything but our main dishes because we didn't want a 'huge' meal but it still felt like a lot of food. I almost wish they would provide smaller portions, especially of the sides.   We plan to go back because the spanakopita and the kleftiko were so tasty. I'd like to try the moussaka and an appetizer next time.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful, if a bit 'rough around the edges' - leaving used plates on the table, etc. The atmosphere is better than expected for how it looks from the outside.  I would recommend this to friends looking for a mid-priced, value-added meal (if you like a LOT of food). The food came very fast, so it was perfect for a movie night.  Food 7/10  Atmosphere 6/10 Service 6/10  Question: Why charge restaurant prices for cooked from frozen or reheated foods?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place as I love Greek food and it's not hard to do it well. Unfortunately, I would've probably been better off at Opa's. The service was mediocre, the greek salad was greasy and  bland, the sides were basically frozen green beans. The lamb was passable and out of their 4 dessert options they only had one available. Not at all what I was expecting for the price point and not sure I would bother going again.  Can't believe all the rave reviews these guys get..."}
{"text":"Went with husband and 1.5 year old.  Good atmosphere. Family Friendly.  Calamari was great! Onions could have been chopped more even and smaller.  Meatballs were good but uneven distribution of cumin, some were perfect some over spiced, the tomato sauce was spot on.  Lamb Chops were thin, a bit fatty and over salted, but cooked perfectly.  I always expect lamb to be outstanding at a greek restaurant and was a bit disappointed.  No roast lamb on the menu either :(  Waitress was very friendly, informative, prompt and great at making recommendations on the wine list."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've ever had this side of Athens!   Super friendly staff, very clean and great atmosphere.    Can't wait to go back!  Keep up the good work!  OPA!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Calimari dinner and was happy with the dish overall. It was one of the cheapest menu items, fyi. Calimari was not greasy and it was cooked just right. The tzatiki sauce was delicious. Portions here are enormous (for me), so I was able to take some home for lunch the next day. I wish they wouldn't use Uncle Ben's rice, though... ah well. The lemon potato was quite nice and the salad was alright (too many red onions for me though). I will be back to try the lamb and pig on a spit!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated, and it shows in the heart that's in their food.  Having lived in Montreal, I am fussy about my Greek food and Calypso's NEVER disappoints.  Priced affordably with generous portions and loads of taste, there is a good reason why this restaurant is a local favourite and people drive from the SW to dine here.  Their Moussaka is the best I've ever tried, it converted me to liking eggplant, and their Ek Mek should be a bath product - so good you want to jump in!  Love this resto!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date and was not dissappointed. My date recommended the place and he also did the ordering - which is fine by me! We shared 3 appetizers: meatballs (forget the greek name), dolmathes and some tatziki. It was lovely, the food was all delicious and we ate everything down to the last bite. It's also worth mentioning that the service here is spot on. A bit on the pricey side for me but it comes through on quality and flavour."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Decent sized portion, one platter was good for the two of us although we weren't too hungry. Little bit pricey but overall pretty good"}
{"text":"Hit this place up during lunch and it was pretty dead - which luckily meant for great service, both prompt and friendly. It's a well kept place, nice and clean and inviting and family run from what I understand.  I tried the Greek beer along with some Spanokapita which came with a healthy serving of Greek salad along side it. Both were great although a tad on the salty side (but then again I've been eating a sodium reduced diet so maybe I was just overly sensitive to it.).  I'd definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"My favourite Greek food in Calgary. The saganaki is a must every time. I love this place"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Nothing pretentious, nicely appointed, good seating, very clean. Well prepared food and a good variety. I have been there as a couple, with business associates, and with my book club and on all occasions it suited my needs. The mousaka is delicious, the Aegean lasagna is so good, and the stuffed calamari is unique and worth trying either as an appetizer or as a meal. They do roast suckling pig as a special and it is amazing. Someone always orders the saganaki cheese dish and it sets the atmosphere when they flambé it at the table and shout out OPA. Price is good, service is as quick as you want it to be, and we will go back regularly for quite romantic dinners as well as birthday celebrations. PS: Took a real chance taking 8 women there for book club meeting. Wasn't sure how they would all enjoy it. Turns out it was a score of 100% all said they would go again and that their food was delicious."}
{"text":"We were craving for Greek food, not any Greek food like \"OPA!' We wanted Saganaki and i wanted Taramosalata. We decided to try Calypso's on Center Street. We ordered the Saganaki (Flaming Cheese), Dolmades (Stuffed Grape Leaves), Trio Dip (Tzatziki, Taramosalata, Hummus) served with warm pita bread and Spanakopita. First off the saganaki was the highlight of the meal this time. I found the dips were ok. I have had better elsewhere. The best Taramosalata is now being served at 2 Greek Girls at the Farmers Market. The Dolmades were served warm but was so over whelmed with lemon juice. I could not taste the natural flavours of the Dolmades, every bite i took i felt i was taking a teaspoon of pure lemon juice. Spanakopita was flaky and was good. Overall this place has a great atmosphere it feels like your neighborhood restaurant, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. However i was not at all impressed by the food. I would just have 2 Greek Girls food if i want good greek food."}
{"text":"The veggies were overcooked and the chicken tasted 'meh'. Not worth the price! There are so many better restaurants in the area. The service was not good either. I will never be back and never recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I felt that the vegetables were previously frozen and bland. The best part of my dinner was the lemon chicken rice soup. We ordered the salmon and it was slightly overcooked and dry. I ordered the calamari entree and there was a ridiculous amount of calamari, but it was the ring kind that seemed to come from frozen as well. I think I would prefer Opa's over this joint, especially for the price. I also thought it wasn't super classy to have thick plastic over the tables, it made me feel like I was a little kid again - and not in a good way."}
{"text":"I live right beside 4th n 40th and wanted to take family for good Greek food. Yelp showed the shoddy Stavros as an option. Wanting to impress my family in a positive light I kept searching. Fortunately, I came across Calypso.   This place was everything Stavros is not. Fair prices, amazing food, nice ambiance, and terrific service. We started with the Greek style ribs which were perfect. For entrees two of us had the succulent lamb, 1 had the seafood pasta and had enough for a second serving. The final order was the chicken souvlaki which was ample, fresh, and plump (unlike the many places which overcook and leave their meat to dry out). Additionally, nothing was doused in garlic/oregano which seems all too popular.  After all was said and done the 4 of us had DELICIOUS food with an appie which cost $115 including a generous tip. A far cry better than the original suggestion from yelp of Stavros which charges $28 per 12\" pizza.   Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I will give 4 star for this restaurant. As a Greek restaurant, its meat and feta are pretty good. I ordered their daily special, the roasted pork(with ribs). The ribs are so good, they are well-seasoned. The price is fair. The only thing I don't like is their vegetables. They are not fresh. I think they are frozen vegetables. Overall, if you want to try Greek cuisine, it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"Wow, so not cool. Tasteless Greek salad in what seemed to be an oil only dressing. Then mains, the veggies were of the store bought frozen kind! Who does that on a $20 plate?!?  Also, crappy service. Since we weren't ordering drinks we were discarded as not worth the server's time. Not only this, I'm not sure who our server was! Four different people helped us, none more than once.  Some positives - atmosphere is quaint, like a family friendly community vibe. The portions were good, and most importantly, the meat was the best part of our dishes. Regardless, there were just too many stokes for me to bother going back."}
{"text":"My stars are for the service. I wasn't very pleased with the food... I came here on a Monday night. Absolutely quiet which was nice. The inside is very well decorated. Not too modern, and not too outdated. It felt cozy, and makes you forget that the restaurant is in a strip mall. Server greeted us right away at the door and sat us. Long Island ice tea was delicious and made perfectly.   Saganaki cheese was very soggy, and not crispy. Calamari did not taste fresh, and they only give you the rings not the tentacley ones ( I LOVE the tentacley ones). The greek salad tasted like Sobey's vegetables (hard and not much flavor), and the feta was just in a cube on top, not mixed in. Our main's were gigantic and the rice was delicious but the potato was way over salted and the veggies tasted frozen.  The Ek Mek for dessert was the best part as well as the free birthday shot of that licorice tasting liquor.   Broken plate and Paros on Main were way better, so I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"A great find off the beaten path.  This Greek restaurant has an understated decor, no blue and white theme and plethora of faux Greek god statues adorning the premises. Dare I say it was tasteful, which was somewhat surprising given it's strip mall location. Okay, maybe not the vinyl tablecloths and the silk plants but not too bad in the whole Greek restaurant scheme of things.    The food itself was excellent. We arrived not starving hungry, so as enticing as the appetizers looked on the menu we opted to just have the dinner which included soup or salad, potatoes, rice and a vegetable. The salad options were Greek or Caesar. The Greek salad although tasty was highly overdressed and the salad bowls were an awkward shape which made it more difficult to eat then it needed to be.  When the mains arrived we were glad that we didn't order appetizers because the portions were very generous. The Kleftiko (roasted lamb) was moist, tender and flavourful. The seafood souvlaki was fabulous and consisted of 2 good sized scallops, 2 jumbo prawns, and 2 large chunks of salmon. All components of the souvlaki were seasoned and cooked perfectly with the tzatziki a perfect addition.  The service was friendly and attentive and the bar menu offered an adequate number of options. I would not hesitate to return for a really nice Greek meal. Opa! 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Didn't really like the food, taste was very bland, cold and not cooked properly. Stuffed Calamari and Artemis Chicken were not cooked properly, Paidakia tasted very bland and burnt in taste, and Seafood Medley was floating in a sea of melted cheese and butter, very unhealthy. The service by the waitress was quite bad too, she was very rude and we were rushed. Not enough cutlery was provided. We didn't feel welcomed overall by the service. If looking for best Greek food is Calgary, go for Santorini."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for greek salad. It has the right balance of everything: feta, olives, tomatoes, red onions, cucumber and dressing. The only thing I would change is that the feta is sliced and the slices put on top of the salad, it's not a biggy but you need to crumble up and mix in the cheese to get the full greek salad taste. I can't really give a thorough review because I always end up having the kleftiko (lamb) because it's so good. I've also had the baby octopus (appetizer) and the sauce is lick-the-plate clean good. There is a small parking lot which the restaurant shares with a couple of other businesses so parking can be an issue but there is street parking in the neighbourhood. Service is efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"My parents have been going here for years and I finally decided to go here for my birthday last week! I see why they keep coming back, the service was great, food was delicious and there's enough to feed a small army! I had the lamb souvlaki and hubby had the kleftiko, both were amazing! The price point is also just right. I love that it is family run establishment and they do always welcome you back and make you feel like it's been no time since you were last there. One other point I will make is it is a great family environment and they have always been great with my special needs sister. Not once have we ever had a complaint about her (as she can occasionally have loud outbursts) and they have always been so sweet with her. Will absolutely 100% will be going back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Food:  mousaka is delicious, a bit greasy 4*.  Caesar salad with dressing made from scratch 5*. Calamari is cooked perfectly which is why it's tender and not rubbery 5*. Piglet suckling very tender and flavourful 5*. Side veggies to go with meal is pretty plain 2*  Price: extremely reasonable considering food is made from scratch Service: waitresses are always on the ball, attentive"}
{"text":"This greek restaurant offered exactly what we were looking for.  Though the calamari was obviously made from frozen rings, it was not overdone or chewy and their homemade tzatziski was one of the best I have ever had.  Entrees proved better still, the lamb is tender and nicely seasoned with tasty sides of chicken flavored rice, veggies and lemon potato. Hubby had the entree dolmathes with lemon cream sauce and it was well balanced and a large portion. We will both be taking home leftovers.  Surprisingly large wine menu for a greek restaurant.  Friendly service to top it off. Running off their feet a little this friday evening.  We will return."}
{"text":"All about trying new places this trip. Aunt was feeling Greek so we decided to try Calypso's Taverna.   We came on a Saturday evening around 7:00pm and there was maybe a handful of tables. So dead (thanks again Stampede). They have a TV and were playing Wheel of Fortune. Haven't seen that show in years.   Menu is pretty typical Greek: appetizers, soups/salads, dips, entrees and pastas (random). Would have liked to try their stuffed calamari! All the entrees come with rice, soup or salad, roast potatoes (nice acidity but salty) and vegetables (seems like they were frozen; bland).   - Greek salad - aunt chose this one. Other alternative was Caesar. - Lentil soup - this was their soup of the day. Hearty.  - Avgolemono - egg lemon chicken soup. Never had this before but it was homey! Like the chicken and rice that's thrown into this soup.  - Salmon special ($26.99) - one of their specials of the night. Had a bite; good but not the greatest. A tad overcooked.  - Pork baby back ribs special ($26.99) - massive platter of ribs! Fall off the bone, tender but still meaty. - Kleftiko ($20.95) - this is their speciality. The lamb shank was slow roasted perfectly. Loads of meat, not gamey and tender.  - Spanakopita dinner ($17.95) - flaky and very buttery.  - 2x Ek ten ($7.00) - Greek style bread pudding. Almonds, cinnamon, custard and whipped cream. This was right up my alley; love light, custard desserts. Just get one to share, it's a big piece.   A little pricey but that's always the case when you go for Greek. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"A pretty solid Greek cuisine, and a fine dining atmosphere/decor,  though with the casual attitude.  Ordered the calamari & their house lamb specialty, one piece on the bone, cooked very tender to fall off nicely.  calamari came w/ lots of red onion, but cut thin and long.  Great sauce.  Entree came w/ rice, steamed veggies which was nice, and a relatively small portion of potato, prob. a third?  Nice booth seating along the wall, and good place to have a group party.  Limited parking in this small strip plaza.  also have to say the server was quite friendly, even when I ordered hot water---came w/ a slice of lemon, nice touch.  Rather tip more than ordering any sugary or alcoholic drinks ;)"}
{"text":"I went to this place as one of my team-members recommended it. I wasn't impressed with the service or food taste. I found the dishes a little pricey and lacking taste. It was an okay experience... nothing that would make me come back."}
{"text":"Yet another Greek restaurant on Centre street you say? Yes, yet another. But hey, considering the plethora of Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Italian eateries around here, the numbers don't matter.  Tucked into the same strip mall as Cabin Fever books Calypso is fairly subtle as far as Greek places go. No loud blue and white signage, no sculptures, just the black and white sign to indicate their presence.  The inside is done in subtle browns and greys (with the odd sculpture by the bar) and the booths and tables are widely spaced. A single flat-screen TV is mounted by the bar, otherwise there's portraits of Greek landmarks on the walls.  Starting out with an order of mythia (mussels in spicy tomato and white wine broth) we picked the mussels clean (and I am not a huge shellfish fan) and scooped up the remaining broth with bread.  I had the moussaka (on a previous visit I had an excellent chicken souvlaki and this was another recommendation) and my girlfriend ordered the psilokomeni salad, something neither her or I had never heard of. My moussaka was rich, creamy and the eggplant was fresh and the beef was subtly spiced. The potatoes had that wonderful Greek roasted taste of lemon that no matter how I hard I try, I can never pull off at home. The vegetable sides were seasonal and fresh. The psilokomeni was simple and wonderful on the palette with the romaine, dill, green onions and garlic in  the house made dressing making for a refreshing meal. The head server later explained to me it was a \"winter salad\" of vegetables available in people's gardens once the tomato/olive season is over. Sadly, the only thing available in most gardens here in the winter is snow. So just head to Calypsos for their version.  To finish, we had two rich, strong, dark Greek coffees and, as a kind gesture, they threw in dessert because they recognized me from a previous visit! I believe we had the bougatsa, phyllo pastry filled with custard and dusted with icing sugar and cinnamon. As good as it sounds and even better with the coffee.  The pricing at Calypsos is reasonable, with the huge portions running from $16-$26 per entree and appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The wine list carries many Greek wines with some other worldly selections and almost every bottle (save one French red) is $40 or less for the bottle. For digestives, Metaxa is also featured.  If you're looking for a comfortable Greek restaurant with all your favourite dishes and great prices, I highly suggest you check it out. I also noticed a few families dining so it's obviously as popular for families as it is for couples out on dates."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this restaurant for quite some time.  The kids have been eating Greek since they were wee little ones so I knew they would enjoy this experience.  After receiving our drinks (beer for the man, wine for me), we started with the Trio of dips & pita which was super delicious. Husband ordered the Rib Platter...we've heard great things about the ribs here and we can now proclaim every single one of them is true.  The kids shared a kids version of the Chicken Souvlaki and being in the mood for chicken, I had the Chicken Souvlaki as well.    Holy big plates batman.  Yes there was a lot of food.  The salads came first and the rest arrived hot and was very tasty.    We browsed the dessert menu and I was elated to discover Ekmek on the menu. I first tried Ekmek 23+ years ago in the small town I grew up in.  A new greek restaurant came to town and they had Ekmek.  It was love at first bite and I have always remembered how much I loved this dessert.  But it is hard to come by.  Many greek restaurants do not make and/or serve it.  Well Calypso's not only serves it they make the best Ekmek I've ever had.  You must try it, simply delicious.  Everything was delightful, from our awesome server down to the lovely but simple decor in the restaurant.  Calypso we adore you. Will see you again soon."}
{"text":"What lovely people! Family owned and run Greek restaurant, with a feeling of dining at home. Such warm and friendly people, great service, great food and very reasonable prices.  We went in a big and loud group with lots of kids and high chairs and special requests, and quite frankly were a nightmare, but the staff, the owners and everyone was so welcoming and accommodating till the end. One of my best dining experiences in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"Calypso's Taverna is a prime example of a family-run restaurant with solid food, ample portions, and friendly service in a fun, relaxed atmosphere - all of which add up to a great night dining out with friends and family. Situated on Centre Street in Tuxedo Park, an area lacking sit-down food options, Calypso's is definitely a standout hidden gem.   If I could give ten stars for the service here, I honestly would. The owners and servers - all family - are enthusiastic, hilarious, helpful, and charming. There is not a dull or rushed moment when engaging in conversation with them! The décor is simple and inviting, reminding me of many a European restaurant that I've had the pleasure of dining in. Food prices are modest for what you get and the chow is great, both in flavour and authenticity. The dinner menu is extensive, but judging by the variety of dishes I tasted, everything is made fresh and with love!  My only qualm would be the drinks list, which seemed to lack in craft beer (Big Rock Trad ale is the closest it gets), cocktails, and a more in-depth wine variety.  After starting with the calamari appetizer, my co-diner and I raved continuously about how tasty and well-prepared it was. A light seasoned batter covered the squid rings and blended perfectly with the accompanying sauce and sliced red onion. It may not have been straight off the boat seafood being that it's Calgary, but it sure tasted like it hadn't come frozen. My co-diner was very impressed and, on several occasions, repeated that it was the best calamari he's ever had. For the main course, we both opted for the Kleftiko, slices of slow-roasted seasoned lamb with a side of rice and a roast potato. We also split a Greek salad, consisting of cut veggies, olives, and a slice of feta, all coated in olive oil. The plating was simple, as is the norm for most traditional European restaurants. The lamb was to die for! It was juicy, succulent, and roasted perfectly, without error. The potato was great, with a fresh lemon flavour, while the rice was just okay - a bit bland and slightly overcooked for my taste. The Greek salad was a hit; a little reminder of how such simple ingredients can make a stellar dish!   With such fond memories of Calypso's Taverna still fresh in our minds, we decided to return a week later, this time for dinner and another round of authentic Greek! We shared the Saganaki starter - oven-baked Kefalograviera cheese served with a soft pita. This dish took me back years and years to previous tastings; having grown up in Romania, we had similar varieties of it. The cheese is gooey and delicious; everyone loved it! For the main I decided to try the Greek Style Ribs, a dish made up of individually cut seasoned pork ribs, served with rice, roasted potato and veggies, as well as a salad or soup. The sides were good, but the star was once again the meat! The pork was meaty, tender, and most importantly, not overseasoned. My co-diners praised their plates and we all left content, with full stomachs.   In the modern age, it's difficult to find honest restaurant owners that truly care for their patrons, but I believe Calypso's is doing things with a traditional approach and I applaud them for it. Looking around at nearby tables, everyone was having a fantastic time at this little neighbourhood Greek joint. The fact that it's blocks away from my current residence, you bet I'll be returning for round three soon! You should do the same!"}
{"text":"When hunger pangs hit, you can just about guarantee hearty portions and lots of flavour if you hit up a Greek restaurant... especially when run by a Greek family. Are any of the Greek places in town run by non Greeks? Somehow I don't think so.   Calypso's Taverna didn't exist when I first moved to Calgary. I do believe it's been around about 4 years or so. And unless you know to go, you'd probably drive by it every time you come down Centre Street. It's another one of those, \"I'm an amazing restaurant hidden in a strip mall\" kind of places we seem to have so much of.  When you visit, you'll no doubt run into Popy. You'll enjoy her. I promise. And you should, of course, order yourself some food. We started with the baked feta and olives, it came with some pita to dip in there. Yum. All I've heard anything about at Calypso's is the Kleftiko - even the menu says it's the house specialty... \"lamb slowly roasted to perfection.\" Well, if perfection is intended to be a succulent piece of meat that wraps my tastebuds in a blanket of flavourful juices, then I guess it must be true.  Drink wise... there was something with mango juice and some alcohol. Can I remember what it was called? Nay. But if you like fruity, it'll do ya fine!  Good for: large group dinners, date, birthday party, anniversary, lunch, or anyone with a large appetite."}
{"text":"This was the first time I came here for Mother's Day by our oldest son & his wife.   My husband and I were told by our neighbors that this was a favourite of theirs since they are Greek and it is authentic Greek food at a reasonable price.  We had the calamari appetizer to start with and found it very light and tasty.  My son and I had the popular dish Kleftiko - roasted tender lamb .  It did not disappoint - so good and delicious!  My husband had the chicken souvlaki and the daughter in law had the Prawn dinner entree.  Everything was tasty .   For dessert my Greek friend said you gotta try the Ek Mek - a custard cake with nuts, and powdered sugar & cinnamon.  We also had the Bougatsa - a phyllo dessert with hot custard and a baklava to all share.  Delicious with a cup of Greek coffee!  We had a great dinner out and would come back here again.  Only negative was it was a very busy night and our dinner took 2.5 hours ..."}
{"text":"First review in Canada. I wanted to have Greek and Yelpers were right, this place is really good. Great staff, great family, and great food. Will visit again for sure and can see becoming a regular when here."}
{"text":"I don't and haven't had Greek food often but I really enjoyed my dinner here.  Don't let the name fool you! It's not 'tavern'-like, it's a restaurant! hehehe. Prices seem to be the same as other Greek resto's... give or take $1-2.  Saganaki was cool - the flaming cheese - I'm sure it's the same everywhere. Others ordered the moussaka which I had a taste of and it was good - I would order this for myself next time I go. I had lamb souvlaki and it was cooked to my preference and came with a side of tzatziki (yummm!), rice, roasted potatoes (yummm), and veggies. Overall a good meal. Great service, and helpful staff. Authentic.  Moussaka was gooooood!  Left full and I didn't have any room for baklava... so next time I must leave some room for the baklava! :)"}
{"text":"Have to say that this was the best Greek Food that I have had in years.  Very impressed.  The food was excellent and very favorable.  The staff was wonderful and the atmosphere was wonderful. My cousins who travel all over the world were impressed and we thoroughly enjoyed the dessert that as they said are hard to find in Canada and found that is was just as good if not better than in Greece.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went on a freezing Saturday for dinner and the heat wasn't working. Froze our butts off on hard, wooden chairs eating very generous portions of  delicious lamb, mousakka and steak (special). Service - fast, servers - friendly. Opinion - go visit."}
{"text":"Apparently you can get loukoumades if you called ahead and ordered? What? Have yet to try it but the fact that the waitress knew what it was showed their true Greek origins.   Great family run business with a good menu."}
{"text":"I just tried Calypso's last night.  The flaming cheese appetizer was very greasy, and the appetizer portions were very small.  However, the calamari and roasted potatoes were fantastic -- some of the best I've had.  The server had a great sense of humour and was willing to accommodate our party for the two small children.  There were no belly dancers or smashing plates to disrupt our conversation, which has to be worth at least half a star!  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a terrific night out tonight. Despite no reservation on a busy Saturday night, Popi made room for us. The service was warm and friendly! Greek Salad was fresh and crisp, while the Lamb Souvlaki was the most tender I've had this side of Montreal. Potato was nicely roasted and rich in olive oil. Tomato lentil soup was very full, and fruity-tasting, with little to no trace of salt. Highly recommended - a warm, lively restaurant with real pride in food and service!"}
{"text":"Greek food at its best!  For appy, we ordered the Calamari.  Tender and lightly battered; comes with tzatziki sauce and sliced raw red onions and parsley.  Quite a large appy for 4 people.    We ordered the following for our meals: Kleftiko - Roasted lamb with roasted potato, rice and steamed vegetables.  Comes with choice of soup or salad - we ordered 2 orders of this wonderful Kleftiko and the 2 soups we had were the Fava bean tomatoey soup and the Chicken Rice Lemon Soup.  Both soups were so hearty for a cold day like today.  Mousaka - Huge and I mean, huge slab of Mousaka!  The Mousaka was nicely layered with zucchini, potatoes, bechamel & tomato meat sauce.  This also came with rice, roasted potato and steamed veges.  Souvlaki - Lovely chunks of charbroiled lamb, cooked medium-rare and definitely, cooked to perfection!  The sides were also rice, potatoes and steamed vege.  Very fulfilling meal!  We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Don't you just love surprises?  Well I LOVE them, especially Calypso's!!!  What a breath of fresh air.  Finally a Greek restaurant that does Greek RIGHT!  After several fails from other Greeks, this will now be one of my go to spots.  Right on Centre Street, you can miss it if you don't pay attention, just kiddie corner to Lina's so if you are familiar with the area, you will definitely know where its at.  Restaurant is pleasantly decorated, understated with touches of Greek heritage throughout, nothing blatant and in your face, but it is very clean, neat, and organized.  To me that is a sure sign that things are run properly.  Seats about 100 which is nice for a private function, and this might be a place I would look into for a Christmas party in all honestly.  In fact, there is a belly dancer on Saturdays! Weeeeee!  The menu is not huge, its actually perfect, something for everyone but my eyeballs immediately hit the charbroil portion and I went for the beef tenderloin platter, hubby had the chicken souvlaki.  Both came with side salads, rice, potato, and steamed veg.  I agree with Julia on the veg...just blah.  If they had sautéed some veg that were in season with a bit of garlic and butter it would have been perfection!  But still, with food this good in Calgary, its totally not a deal breaker for me, uh uh, hell no!  The tenderloin was perfectly done, and when I say perfect, I mean there was still some pink in the middle and not overtly seasoned to death.  A very nice cut of meat done right.  The rice was perfect, the potato was nicely roasty and lemony but the veg were simply steamed sting beans, perhaps the frozen variety. Meh.  I LOVED the tzatziki, perhaps the best I've had.  My husbands chicken was all succulent breast meat, again, not killed on the grill and just tangy, and so darn salivating good, drooling now...  All in all, for about $20 you will have the best meal here!  Top that with a sweet talking older fella (owner and chef!), courteous staff and a complementary shot of ouzo for first timers...what else can I say but OPAAAAAA!!!!  I can't wait to come here for lunch, for about $10 you can have this goodness compacted every day of the week, real talk, Rotten Ronnies now runs you about $7.00!  I think I should invest in a gym membership soon.    My only little complaint and it is tiny, was I didn't see a desert menu, I could have probably been seduced into indulging in something if it caught my eye, but its probably better that I didn't!  See you soon my new friends!"}
{"text":"I am Archimedes. I am a nymph frolicking in the woodlands. I am a demi-god.  Oh, wait, my mistake, I have just stuffed myself with so much calamari that I am obviously hallucinating.  This place is great, it is not adorned with terrible fake pillars and your eyes are not bombarded by a colour palette comprised entirely of blue and white (bad Greek or euro trash music though). The family that owns this place is very friendly and accommodating, we have been here with a party of 4, 6, 8 and 20 and every time the service has been fabulous. Also go here if you are Greek, cause they will love you. I always go with my Greek friend (as I am a little too Dutch) and they always bring us Ouzo for the table and are attempting to set her up now with their son.  The food is to die for, I will eat an entire discus full of their tzatziki. If you order any of their dinners you will be stuffed, the Calamari dinner is a plate full of breaded squid goodness with lemon potato, rice and veggies (and of course it comes with tzatziki!). You also get your choice to start with a Greek salad, soup or a plain boring ol' green salad, but why would you order that in a Greek restaurant!! The starters are great such as the sanganki and their desserts will put you into a phyllo pastry overload, but it is so worth it.  I am not giving Calypso a full 5 because their side veggies have been steamed to death, or maybe they came out of a bag, but they are no good, and I can't say I have really tested the rest of the mains as I ALWAYS get the calamari dinner.   Come down, meet Popi, order a Mythos and prepare to enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Upgrading Calypso's to the totally earned five stars. What a good place to visit!  Food quality is as great as I remember it after two years, and service is equally awesome. Friendly, useful, professional. I just love every of my visits to Calypso's and will be back again, for sure.  It is on a pricey side, ok, but in this case you get what you've paid for - hefty portions of great, authentic food. I guess I've eaten half of their menu, which means I have a lot of wonderful stuff yet to discover!  Honestly love to see a business working well for years. Congratulations Calypso's, you are doing a very good job.  Tested, proved, and recommended wholeheartedly."}
