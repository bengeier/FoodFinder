{"text":"Trying to figure out what to eat... read over the online menu for Merchant St., and decided to try it out. I couldn't be more pleased- the food was fabulous for my \"clean eating (Paleo) life style.   My husband and I both agreed- we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for 20 years and can honestly say this is some of the very best food I've ever had! I've been twice now, and the short ribs tonight, completely sublime! We also had the scallops with corn succotash - really out of this world. The prices are beyond reasonable, and quality is absolutely top notch. The ambiance and decor is elegant, yet cozy and warm. This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland by far!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see that there is something in this space. Right off of Lincoln Park, it's a nice place to do lunch. While we were there, the menu was fairly small, but there was a promise of additional menu items coming soon.   I had the turkey press sandwich, and my friend had the Cuban. We gave each other half so we could try both, and they were both very good. I would recommend this as a place to come for a quick bite.  It's very casual, and is also a good option for carry out. Additionally, it appeared that they had a wide variety of wines to purchase by the bottle. I did not sample any of those or pay a lot of attention to the selection.   I did, however, have a \"adult cola\" which is a cola with less sugar. They have other unique soda options. Next time, I may try a ginger beer."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back! Service was great, and the food was DELICIOUS! And very reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in tremont. Try the scallops if they have them"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Merchant Street going to Cleveland. The food was incredible. The skin was crispy on the chicken thighs and the chimichurri on the filet was amazing. Smore nachos was a great dessert to finish the evening. I definitely will be heading back."}
{"text":"Great food; nice selection to choose from; good portions, and perfectly prepared!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Merchant Street Saturday evening.  Michelle our server was personable and attentive.  Thoughtful menu & excellent wine options.  Our meals were well prepared and simply presented.  We had a birthday girl in our party and called ahead to confirm that we could bring our own gluten free cake to serve after dinner.  They accommodated without hesitation and helped out with our little surprise.   I would certainly recommended an evening at Merchant Street.!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sandwiches! The price is right and great to be able to enjoy a glass of wine or beer on the patio. Love having this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We have been to merchant street three times and will keep going back. Service is excellent. The owner is engaged and visible. Street parking is pretty easy around lincoln park. The food has been excellent and is reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in tremont. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The best happy hour! We ordered some delicious eggplant ravioli, bourbon meatballs and mushroom flatbread and EVERYTHING was spectacular. Plus, you cannot beat the happy hour pricing. The drinks were also great ($6 cocktails at happy hour!) and the server/bartenders were very welcoming and friendly. Casual vibe, yummy food and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and ambiance. Taryn was a great bartender and very attentive. Cocktail skills are on point. This place rules."}
{"text":"What a cute newer place in Tremont! This place has 5-6 rotating sandwiches daily, salads and sides you can buy to go or eat there as well as a selection of wine and beer. Daily they have featured bottles of wines for their daily pours as well.   I came in for a quick sandwich to go before heading to a volunteer event. I ordered the Turkey Press: turkey, bacon, herb mayo, cranberry mostarda and white cheddar. It was SOO good! I can't wait to come back and try a different featured sandwich and maybe stay and enjoy their patio."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, good service and good wine selection. Stopped by at this place for dinner on a Saturday night. Decided to get some appetizers/small plates to share. The meatballs were amazing as were the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese, eggplant ravioli and Mac & cheese. Everything was tasty, fresh and delicious. One of the best meals I've had in Tremont. They also had fantastic house Sangria & a nice wine list. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This was a very welcoming restaurant. it was very peaceful and I was able to enjoy myself with my girlfriends. We went during happy hour & everything was six bucks! A a glass of wine, appetizers, pita bread, mussels and everything you could ever want from a happy hour menu! The stuffed dates were amazing! They also offered mac & cheese & meatballs and a small selection of $4 beers! I highly recommend this restaurant to go to! exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Right down the street from my house and they allow dogs inside and out!! The turkey sandwich with cranberry spread is amazing, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! seriously! What a great neighbor to another loved place, civilization. I've only ever gone for lunch but I'm excited to try the wine and cheese board in the evening."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place for an excellent meal.  Love the intimacy and the view looking out on Lincoln Park. Amazing cocktails, too!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this amazing dish stuffed acorn squash with Himalayan red rice roasted, mushrooms, dried cranberries, walnuts, arugula, heirloom tomatoes in a lemon thyme beurre blanc sauce."}
{"text":"Great place with a warm neighborhood feeling.  Delicious food, especially love the stuffed acorn squash.  My husband had a surprise 50th birthday party here and it was fabulous!  This is our \"go to place\" when we want to relax and enjoy a great night out!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! We stopped by on a Friday for happy hour during Tremont's art walk. It was busy, but we managed to find a seat at the bar.   We tried a cocktail and the roasted cauliflower app. The flavors were fabulous and both were creative-not things I had seen before. Great prices and selection of offerings for happy hour too. We took a peek at the full menu and it definitely made me want to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night at merchant Street, my wife mentioned in passing that her dinner was not as hot as she would have liked.  The waitress took it off our bill, greatly appreciated but not totally necessary.  Food was wonderful but the restaurant can be noisy.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to get dinner to-go. Super excited about this little spot. Menu changes with ingredients on hand so the menu isn't huge, but it's intriguing. I had a pressed turkey on the most flaky bread and amazing cranberry spread. A whole lotta yum. I definitely will need to come and try the cheese and charcuterie board and a bottle of wine, but I need to not be solo for that. (If I DO consume a bottle and a board alone, I am not documenting that here...) Service was pleasant and the store was bright and cheery and immaculate. There's a little shopping market section and a few tables inside. The patio is adorable and that's probably where you'll find me and my wine next time. Welcome, Merchant Street! So glad you're here!"}
{"text":"I've visited Merchant Street numerous times, previously, but had never submitted a review.  My friend and I stopped in for Happy Hour, on a Friday evening, and we truly enjoyed our food.  I ordered the warm cauliflower and chickpea salad, which sounds a bit strange, but is delicious!  Hands down, my favorite item at Merchant Street, with the meatballs being a close second, but back to the salad.  The salad includes a generous portion of chickpeas, cauliflower, and capers, mixed in a tahini dressing topped with a chopped boiled egg, served warm and just $6 on the happy hour menu.  The BBQ bourbon meatballs ($6 happy hour) are tasty too, the meatballs are tender, seasoned nicely, tossed in bourbon BBQ sauce and topped with just a little bit of cheese....yum!.  We also ordered the pita/hummus platter ($6 happy hour).  Traditional homemade hummus, Sriracha hummus and olive tapenade, served with toasted pita triangles.  We ordered mac n cheese ($6 happy hour), I didn't taste, but my friend mentioned that it was tasty, cheddar and smoked gouda cheeses!).  I ordered the lemon caper shrimp from the regular menu ($11).  The shrimp were cooked perfectly, nicely seasoned in a lemon caper sauce, not sure that I would spend $11, the portion was just moderate.  Last but least we ordered dessert, bourbon peach crumble, with vanilla ice cream.  We truly enjoyed our visit and will return!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I love happy hour. Tremont has some spectacular options in this realm - probably the best in Cleveland. That being said, you've GOT to check out this happy hour. Of note: the New York Sour cocktail, goat cheese stuffed bacon wrapped dates, BBQ meatballs and Mac and cheese. All are phenomenal and only $6. I've never had dinner here, as it's a bit on the pricier side but based on how delicious the small plates were I would definitely try it. Happy hour is Tuesday-Friday 4:30-7 and all day on Sunday (!!) so no excuse not to check it out."}
{"text":"Another stop during our 2018 Cleveland Restaurant Week marathon of unbridled gluttony., Merchant Street is an eatery with a shining kitchen that's dulled by lackluster ambiance and stilted service. Everyone on here seems to be raving about the fantastic happy hour, but we didn't partake so there'll be none of that here. Oh, and what's with the deal of places only offering happy hour specials if you sit at the bar? This place is pretty small, seriously, the bar is about 6 feet from the rest of the tables. And the bar normally comes with annoyingly chatty barkeeps and buttnumbing seating. Whatever, I didn't take advantage so I'll discontinue going there.  The restaurant really isn't much to speak of. Sure, it's nice, it's got plenty of natural light, but it just feels sort of blah. It's not one of those places where you'll walk in and you feel like someone put some serious thought into the design. It's clean, so there's that, but it has that hotel restaurant feel to it.   We arrived sometime around 5pm on a Tuesday and the place was completely empty. Not a soul save for the bartender/server. Even the hostess stand was empty. It was a bit like a movie set for a restaurant and the director hadn't called action yet. She greeted us with a half-hearted smile and we took a seat by the front windows. This is probably the main reason for the 3 stars. The service was pretty lackluster. Sure, she did her job, but that was it. She was visibly uninterested, just going through the motions.  If you're looking to buzz your brain, they've got what you're looking for. Well, unless your a guy that likes a big craft beer selection. They had 6 taps, two of them were out, and nothing special. On the bright side, they at least had something. Wine your bag? Lots to choose from there, too. Now if you're looking for $12 cocktails with Seussian ingredients like lemon-celery bitters, lavender infused agave, and smoked orange, they've got a solid list. Fun, yes, just not my thing.  The food was really the star here. The menu features a well-curated selection of small plates, salads and larger-size entrees. It's your typical new American cuisine thing, simple dishes, nods to classics and all. For restaurant week there wasn't really a pre-set menu inasmuch as it was a pick your own kinda thing. App, entree, dessert it was. Everything we had was simply delicious. Beautiful presentation, cooked perfectly, just the right size. Seriously. It almost made me forget about the boring restaurant and anemic service.  The mushroom and leek flatbread was crispy, garlic-y, earthy and yummy. My wife loved her Kale Caesar (Kale! You abomination!) and found it fresh and delicious. Hell, the egg on top was a wonder to behold. Still, it was on top of kale. The burger, cooked a medium so spot-on other cooks should take a lesson. Sure, it was obscenely tall and there was no way it could ever fit in a typical mouth and the burger was scorched all to hell, but it was wonderful. The seared scallops were equally brilliant. Cooked perfectly, sweet, and tender and the sweet corn succotash with smoked paprika oil and bits of bacon was so damn good.  We had two desserts because restaurant week and both were great. The toffee panna cotta was jiggly to the spoon with crispy chocolately caramelly toffee bits and the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel sauce. My pancreas is painin' just typing about these things.  Yes, we ate everything and I'm not ashamed to say it. OK, maybe a little, but I'm willing to own it.  So there you have it. Merchant Street is like the pearl in the oyster story if there was such a thing. The outside is sorta ugly and there's a layer of slimy stuff you've gotta work through to get to the prize, but once you do you're like \"hell, it was worth nearly cutting off my thumb to get to this pretty little begemmed nugget and this really belongs on a necklace\".  Bill: $111.00 without tip"}
{"text":"I came here for a Tuesday night dinner date and had the cod, my husband had the burger and we shared the cauliflower mashed potatoes. Both were really good and they had a large selection of wines. For dessert we had flourless chocolate cake which was my favorite part of the meal. Such a cute atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Went to Merchant Street this past week, loved it! The staff was so welcoming and friendly, the sandwiches were delicious as well as the sides and soups. It's about $9-$12 per person depending on your side but it's definitely worth it. We will be back to Merchant Street."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Merchant Street last night.  We shared a flat bread and baked shrimp appetizers both were nice portions, fresh and flavorful. My roasted chicken thighs were perfect and Dave enjoyed his burger very much! It was a great evening, the service was outstanding and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The white wine on the happy hour menu is flawless. The mac and cheese and mussels were also pretty good, but kind of run of the mill. I definitely wanted to love the goat cheese stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, but I found them to be really heavy and too sweet for me.   This place definitely has an older person vibe, I was by far the youngest person there for most of the evening, even though it was happy hour. I definitely think the median age was around 55. Overall, though, good service, decent food & great wine."}
{"text":"So far both of the times I have ordered here, it has been to-go... but great experiences both times. The food is delicious and fresh/pleasant atmosphere. I'm developing an addiction to their little rosemary shortbread cookies. (I'm not 100% sure they're shortbread, so don't quote me on that! I don't remember what they called them, but they are delightful!) I also appreciated that I was able to pick up beer to-go as well with my order. Happy to welcome Merchant Street to the neighborhood and looking forward to checking out the new expansion that just opened as well in addition to the deli & provisions side."}
{"text":"We were at the Tremont farmers market and wanted to just get a small bite to eat. My bourbon bbq meatballs (4) were delicious and my fiancé's cauliflower salad was \"just what I wanted\". Friendly staff and and open doors on a nice night earns this place an easy five stars. Will make sure to bring the parents here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Jem! Perfect atmosphere, relaxing and good vibes. The staff is friendly, the food was fantastic, and their local beer options were on point! The ham sandwich was the best sandwich I've had in years! Recommend this place to everyone.   -Ma--Ca"}
{"text":"What a treat Merchant Street was for us. My husband and I were visiting Cleveland and we were staying in Tremont. We were greeted with smiles and felt welcomed the second we walked in.   We had the mussels and sausage flat bread as appetizers. Both were absolutely delicious. The broth and sauce that the mussels came with was pleasing to the taste buds. My husband had the burger for dinner and I had the salmon with pasta. Both dishes were satisfying. I have to say the pasta was probably one of the best pastas I have ever had. Whatever ingredients Joshua the chef used for the pasta sauce was just heavenly.   Everything about our dinner at Merchant Street was just delightful and was the best dinner we had during our stay in Cleveland. The owner, chef and staff made us feel like special guests which makes it the icing on the cake when having a delicious dinner experience. If we're in Cleveland again, this will be our first stop for dinner."}
{"text":"We don't get to go out that often and when we do we like to make an occasion of it, so we got a table for 8 at the well-appointed Merchant Street restaurant in Tremont, and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. The service was genial and welcoming from the moment we arrived. The owner, John, was easy to hang with and ended up taking a picture with us before we left. We enjoyed the appetizers -- loved my goat cheese salad -- along with a nice Chenin  Blanc wine.  Our favorite entrees were the scallops and the burgers.  Creme Brulee and a rhubarb crisp concoction with bourbon were the fav desserts.  It is not a sports bar by any means, but when the Kentucky Derby ran, everyone gathered to watch the race together,  then returned to our tables... just the right balance."}
{"text":"Great food, Great staff. Perfect lunch spot for grabbing a healthier bite and maybe a glass of wine. I come in to do work on my laptop a lot and am always welcomed and accommodated with open arms. So glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood, Merchant Street! I'm glad to see another quick & easy lunch option in town. At about $8 a sandwich & $4-$5 for sides, this one is slightly more expensive than its neighbors at, say, Civilization & La Bodega, but my first sandwich at the new joint - a panini with shredded chicken, artichokes, lemon ricotta, & arugula - tasted incredible & was well worth the price.   Merchant Street is bright & airy with a clean, sophisticated vibe - think lots of stark white & shiny wood, with potted herbs growing indoors (to go in their homemade food, no doubt) & specialty foods lining the shelves. I'll say that it seems, as of opening, a little bit more sparse than expected - I was hoping for something I little bit more chock-full of local faves - but there's plenty of time for growth! One wall features ready-to-eat foods like salads, sandwiches, & other small sides, & their made-to-order menu changes daily.   There's limited seating indoors - just a few stools at the windows, & a couple small tables in the wine room - but seating is ample on their outdoor patio, perfect for people-watching in nice weather. And speaking of the wine room: Check that out, for sure.  Food came out quickly, tasted fresh & delicious, & was served by friendly employees who seem excited to be in the 'hood. I look forward to visiting them again!"}
{"text":"I was beyond disappointed with my meal. I love Merchant Street's sister restaurant, Tartine, and was excited to try Merchant Street. I felt like all of my food lacked flavor with the exception of the bacon wrapped dates. The food at this location did not even come close to the food at Tartine and the bar service was meh. I hope things improve."}
{"text":"Meh, yummy meatballs, ok service, not impressed, not horrible, but reviews are overstated, won't go back."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I haven't actually been to the restaurant, I just tried them at Taste of Tremont. I will update my review once I get a chance to visit the actual place.       Yesterday was taste of tremont and as my boyfriend and I were walking through and deciding which foods to try, we came across the Merchant Street food tent. Neither of us had ever heard of them before, but they had mac and cheese and it was exactly what I was craving. Plus, their prices actually allowed for trying multiple things versus the $8-$10 a sample at any other tent. The mac and cheese was $5 for a decent amount and we also tried the meatball slider, which was also $5.       Both were delicious, but the mac and cheese absolutely stole the show. It was definitely some of the best mac and cheese I have ever had. It was cheesy with a perfect crusting on it. The meatball slider was also delicious and had great sauce.       I can't wait to visit the restaurant to try more!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bistro not the lunch/sandwich side of the house.   We had a great dinner from Chef Dolata. The stuffed dates and Brie appetizers were perfect. I had the Cod with spicy spinach and it was great. The cod was pan sautéed and extremely good - tender with a light crisp and good flavor. The spicy spinach was really good, but be prepared for some heat. Try the eggplant bread pudding side, delicious. Cool spot, good wine list, good service, good value too for the quality! Well done"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the modern chic environment of merchant street. It's a great place to grab some cocktails on a girls night out. I thought the menu was subpar - very simple, very basic. We ordered the lamb chop pot pie and potato and leek soup, wasn't amazing, and wasn't terrible. Just eh. I thought it was kind of pricey for how mediocre the food was. I may go back for a cocktail, but I won't go back for the food. 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"A fabulous addition to the Tremont area is Merchant Street, with the owner present and welcoming as we sat down to dine. With a simplistic, yet refined menu, food options are for all lovers alike. The intimate ambiance of this cozy place, allows for table and soft seating, along with the bar that could hold roughly 15-20 people.  The menu lends itself to seafood, vegetarians, and all others in between. I highly recommend dabbling in the follow: mussels, charcuterie board, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and the Merchant salad. Amongst 4 people, and other dishes not mentioned, we all split these and were able to leave feeling full. To top it off, we also tried the chocolate cake and creme brulee, which I thought was fabulous.  Overall, the ambiance, food, service and overall experience is one that I highly recommend for all to try. This is an excellent add-on to the already hustling Tremont area."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Can't say enough good things about this place. John, the owner was so gracious & friendly, the setting has a trendy yet hospitable vibe, the crowd on a Saturday night ran the gamut of all age groups, the menu choices are fabulous and Chef Timothe Crandall executes his craft with superior skill! Try the beet salad & goat cheese stuffed dates! Impeccable. Can't wait to go back. We are 4 east side fans with plans to return!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for some drinks and a couple of appetizer before we went to dinner double date at a different restaurant. I wished we were able to extend our time and stay for dinner, because this place blew me away. I ordered the smoked pineapple cocktail on a whim and it was phenomenal. They have a lot of craft cocktails that seem worthy of trying out. Everything on the menu made me say yum, I can't wait to make my way through it!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed with Merchant Street- the quality of their service, food, and drinks- and especially the atmosphere (no loud music/people shouting to hear one another). Highly recommend all around!"}
{"text":"Merchant Street is a fabulous new Gem in Cleveland's bag of fine dining places. Casual and super friendly atmosphere go hand in hand with John McDonnells newest eatery. The fair covers all bases, steak to fish to vegetarian to vegan and the cocktails are superb. You won't be disappointed and being there guarantees a smile on your face with a belly full of goodness. All I can say is WOW and I'm heading back soon. BTW, this butternut squash soup OMG !!!!"}
{"text":"Took the wife here for dinner earlier. Our comments:  Food: The goat cheese-stuffed dates were incredible. We could have easily ordered a few more of these and not eaten dinner, but that would have meant that we would have missed out on the entrees. Both of our entrees were great (salmon with mint pea purée, and the house burger - which their house ketchup sauce is fantastic), and we ordered the truffle mac and cheese on the side, which was fantastic. Our dessert of vanilla creme brûlée was nothing short of solid.   Drinks: Highly recommend and lavender margarita and bourbon blueberry drinks. Both were the right combination of sweets and liquor. My wife ordered a lavender martini, which the bartender made off of the menu and did an incredible job with.   Service: Frannie was a great waitress - she was very attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. Got a chance to talk with John (owner), who was also very cordial.   Ambiance: The design is fairly minimalistic, but done in a classy way. Good music selection, and never overpowering on the volume. Good for conversation and focusing on food.   Overall, we had a great dining experience - we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome .  Dates are best appetizer. Get the filet, sauce is out of this world.  The most exquisite wine list you will find."}
