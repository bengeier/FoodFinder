{"text":"We were so looking forward to a new good place in Henderson.  But unfortunately, I doubt we'll be back.  The food was very disappointing.  We tried various things from salad to appetizers to the creamed spinach and none of it was very good.  They need a new chef.

Our waiter Michael, however, was fabulous and would give him separately 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and great atmosphere. The sweet potato fries are to die for! Our sever Micah was excellent! I would recommend you ask for him while dining."}
{"text":"This was an amazing meal. Did the 3 course meal for two, chopped salad is the way to go, it was delicious topped with avocado. Filet cooked perfectly, girlfriend ordered the salmon, again cooked to perfection. Great value for a perfectly cooked steak and portion sizes. Definitely a must go!  We asked for bread, it wasn't offered like in most other restaurants, piping hot rolls with butter and melted cheese on top, weren't as tasty as they look but if you're interested,ask."}
{"text":"We go there for lunch! Im a huge critic of food and this is the best place all around I have come across. Go and try it!"}
{"text":"Great service. Patio was excellent to eat lunch with my 2 year old date. Wish they had some fruits though. From the host, excellent welcome. The server, I forgot her name, was on it. She made sure my drink is never empty. Always checking up on us. Great suggestions for the meal. Good customer service and her assistant was also excellent. Prices for steak are excellent, better then the station casinos or other steak house around the neighborhood. Hopefully the management takes care of the servers because servers makes customers come back. There are thousands of steak house, but when your server is excellent, people return for that place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  For the price of the meal I should be in heaven. However, the Prime Rib was a disaster.  I ordered medium but the first slice came out well down and gray in color.  I sent it back.  For $44 I have high expectations.  The second round came back medium but still gray in appearance.  Holy crap, for $44 you get Prime Rib that is individually shrink wrapped slices and warmed up in the oven!  It tasted fine but is not what you are paying for.  We won't be back and you shouldn't waste your time.  Go to the steakhouse in Sunset Station if you want a decent slice of beef because you won't find it here."}
{"text":"Great food. The meat is sooo go and tender!!! Can't wait to go back. 
We love the large windows."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, waitstaff and food Great! Decor is gorgeous and makes you want to hang out. Special date dress up place or nice casual hang out on the patio or in the bar place. Prices are good too. Location at a mall front surprised me but did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great happy.hour daily.  Started going to.happy hour and the prime rib sliders with a wedge salad is the way to go. Started ordering steaks and they are delicous.. great seasonings cooked to perfecttion.. Prime rib.is nothing special.  Great service."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say the food was amazing!!!! My friend and I had the 8 ounce filet, hers with sweet potato waffle fries and mine with asparagus. The steak was buttery and melted in my mouth. We also shared a bottle of wine. There was live piano/ singing. Our server was amazing.  All through dinner he poured our wine and checked on us frequently. It was after dinner that we were disappointed. As soon as we finished eating, we felt like we were being pushed out of our seats. Our server even said to us that we could finish drinking at the bar!  We still had wine in our bottle and the place was empty! He hovered over us and made us very uncomfortable until we left. We spent almost $200 for dinner. We just wanted to relax! I still give them four stars because the food. I hope this was a fluke because this was a very nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank you a great steak and great service, best meat candy I've had in a long time.  Thank you for opening up a location here, this area needed something a little upper scale.  And thank you for not being in a smoky casino."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Henderson. Love the options. Drink and appetizer. Or casual burger (also best in Henderson). Or big steak dinner. And Happy Hour is killer."}
{"text":"We came here tonight based on yelp recommendations and it didn't disappoint.  I had the filet with a loaded baked potato.  It was cooked perfectly.  My favorite was the wedge salad.  My husband had the rib eye and creamed spinach.  Delicious!  The desert, which came compliments of yelp, was a pound cake...yum!  My one recommendation would be with regard to the bread...rolls.  They were fine, but I miss the sweet wheat bread and sour dough normally served at steakhouses.  Overall a good restaurant with great steaks and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time for dinner at a table, usually at bar. Didn't begin well. Ordered bottle of wine (Wednesdays wine bottles under $100 are half off.) Waitress brought wrong bottle. Finally found the right one. Service a bit shaky at first, but got better. Ordered chopped salad which we wanted to share, so they split it for us. Nicely done, good flavor and not overly dressed. BFF ordered 8oz. New York \"wet aged\" medium. It came out more Medium Rare. Still great though. I told him that is the way steaks are supposed to be eaten anyway. Tender and good flavor. Mashed potatoes very good, but not for people who don't like to see oil at the edges of the bowl. I had fish (halibut) and chips. Yummy..could have used more crunch, but that's just me. Good fries. We celebrated a birthday and they brought out an ice cream sundae that was delicious ( awesome portion). Nice touch on the birthday card that came with it. Bill came to $135, which I didn't find over priced, but BFF did. Nice that wine was 1/2 priced."}
{"text":"Service is great, decor is great, food is great. Bar has beautiful TV's for watching sports. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Atrocious service, absolutely abysmal.  We waited 50 minutes (fifty) for an appetizer with a 6:30 reservation on a weeknight. The main course was even worse! It was 1:20 later (one hour and twenty minutes) when we gave up and walked out. The manager was joking around with some couple in the bar and couldn't even be bothered to see why two diners were leaving without paying the bill.  I told the hostess we're leaving and we're not paying because of the horrible service... she didn't seem to care either. \"Have a nice evening,\" came the stock reply. Arrogant manager, terrible service and a dipsy hostess. Terrible."}
{"text":"This entire dining experience was outstanding from the greeting at the door to the attentive and polished service by Michael. I ordered the dry rub 100% organic grass fed filet mignon and a baked potato, everything was melt in your mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"My family decided to try Larsens to see what it was all about. It is conveniently located in the Galleria Mall and parking is not an issue. 

My rating is actually 3.5 stars for the reasons enumerated below. 

Upon arriving we were warmly greeted by a hostess who opened the door and showed us in. We were then seated in a booth. I found the booth to be a bit small and uncomfortable, but then again I wasn't there to spend the evening. 

Our waitress came over and asked us if we we're ready to order. I found this a bit odd as we had barely had a chance to sit down and look at the menu. I think she caught her mistake as she quickly asked if we would like to order a drink. We asked for water and she walked off. About three minutes later she returned with three waters and placed them on our table. I told her I would likely order a beer with dinner.  

She then asked if we were ready to order and we said we needed a minute, so she asked if we wanted appetizers. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip. The dip arrived in short order and was steaming hot, creamy and delicious although I didn't think there were enough chips as we ran out of chips before we ran out of dip. 

We were nearly finished with our appetizer when the waitress returned and asked if we were ready to order. I found it odd she did not tell us about the specials but since this was our first time at Larsens, I thought perhaps they don't have specials. We ordered Prime Rib, The Burger and Hawaiian Tri-tip. As the waitress began to walk off I asked what beer they had on tap as she had apparently forgotten I wanted a beer with dinner. She told me what they had on tap and I asked her about the red ale. She told me she didn't drink beer but could bring me a sample. I agreed. She walked off and about five minutes later brought me a small sampler. 

I finished the sampler and waited for her to return. My wait was much longer than I anticipated. Despite walking past our table several times she never looked at us, asked if we needed anything nor asked about my beer. 

About 20 minutes later our food arrived and I asked the waitress bringing our food (not the same one that had been helping us earlier) if I could get a beer. She asked which kind and I told her the red ale that I had sampled. This waitress walked right over to the bar and got my beer. I was a bit surprised that it wasn't the same one I had tasted. I could tell as the beer I sampled was more of a blond ale and the one I ordered for dinner ended up being a dark red ale. Both were tasty so I didn't mind it being different, especially as it complimented my prime rib perfectly. 

As for the food, the prime rib was cooked to perfection and the creamed spinach was creamy, prepared perfectly and served in an attractive dish next to the prime rib. 

My wife had the ribs with brussels sprouts, the ribs were  tender and prepared properly, although we were a bit surprised that they didn't have more of a teriyaki flavor as they are billed as Hawaiian. None the less they were delightful. The brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection and delightfully tasty. 

Our daughter had \"The Burger\" and it was prepared perfectly as well. She had the homemade macaroni and cheese and felt the use of penne pasta was a fun play on elbow macaroni. 

While we were eating we overheard a waiter at a different table telling the guests at that table about the specials, I was rather disheartened that we had not been given the opportunity to hear about them. 

Overall the food is fantastic, and the ambiance is a mix between upscale steakhouse and trendy modern hangout.  They have a large selection of wine, although we chose not to have any on this trip. The bar appeared to be well stocked and the selection of draught beers was adequate. 

The only issue was the waitress on this trip was rather inattentive and appeared that she wasn't really in the mood to be at work. I do understand we all have off days and sometimes we're not on our game so I will return here again and I'm sure next time the service will be as good as the food. 

As such I give this place 3.5 stars. 5 for food and 2 for service. Service truly can make or break a location, even with food as well prepared as this was."}
{"text":"Approximately a month ago, we decided not to drive to The Capital Grill on The Strip. I saw a review for Larsen's Grill and decided to give it a shot. It was a beautiful day and Micah Siler (our server) set us outside with the view. Micah is the ultimate in servers. I told him it was our first time, he explained the entire menu and suggested several items. He is quite engaging, he ensured our every need was taken care of.  I found the food presentation to be superb, the quality was excellent, and portion sizes generous. Micah explained they make their house salad dressing (it was delicious by the way). We ordered Long Island Tea's which were so good we asked to speak to the Bartender. Daniel Scott came over and introduced himself. Search no more if you enjoy Long Island Tea's. I have become a fan and will return."}
{"text":"Even though there are hundreds of top quality restaurants in Las Vegas, Larsen's delivers with outstanding service and great menu selections. I usually have a couple items on a menu that interest me, but it was a tough choice because there were many items that looked excellent.   I had the Chilean sea bass while my wife enjoyed a filet.  Both were excellent and cooked to perfection.  Neil did a great job, and was always there when we needed him.  He knew the menu and specials, and was very professional in handling our table.  We sat outside on the deck area, which was very nice.  I highly recommend this restaurant, and Neil as a waiter.  It was my first visit, buy I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night and had the dry aged filet. It was delicious- very tender and well seasoned. My friend got the ribs and they were fantastic. Lots of food and the meat was falling off the bone. Her meal came with a choice of a side and she got the garlic mashed potatoes which were great. I selected the Mac and cheese. It was just okay and next time I will probably try something different.  Overall the food was fantastic. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledge and you could tell he was well trained and educated on the food and wine selections.  He was also very attentive without being pushy.  Very impressive food and service."}
{"text":"The bartender Dan is AMAZEBALLS!!!! The Best lemon drop martini EVER!!   Food is great! This is Henderson's best kept secret and they have happy hour even on Saturday's.  You are missing out if you haven't been to Larsen's!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, prices very competitive. The wait staff was very friendly and efficient. My wife even received a follow up call asking how our visit went. Not many places do that. Definitely worth a visit. We will be back."}
{"text":"Recently four of us gals went to Larsen's for a 70th birthday luncheon.  It was the first time there for all of us.  The food was just incredible  We ordered several different meals so we could try each others.  ALL of them were so delicious!!!  Can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu.  Our server was Jeremy and he was absolutely fantastic!!  He sang Happy Birthday to our friend.  What a voice!!!!!  

The coffee was really special too.  

We had a wonderful time and will definitely return.  

Check it out!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Attended a birthday party on their outside patio. What a beautiful space! Only sampled appetizers. Didn't care for the mini crab cakes , but the meatballs a prime rib sandwiches were delicious. Definitely coming back for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I struggled to decide to give them 2 or 3 stars. We arrived and the hostess was very friendly, after we were seated our server came to the table in a timely manner. The server was great, she was very friendly and made sure all our needs were met quickly. She is the main reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2. We ordered the fried onions, strawberry martini and a margarita to start. The drinks were delicious and though I'm not a huge onion fan the fried onions were ok. ( I enjoy other businesses fried onions better). I had the Ribeye with mac and cheese, my wife had the filet with cream spinach. We both ordered our steaks medium rare and this is when things took a wrong turn. When the steaks arrived I touched it with my finger and it felt firm. I took the first bite and it did have great flavor and good grill marks. After a couple bites getting closer to the center the meat was not looking medium rare. I cut into the center of the meat and it was medium at Best working it's way towards medium well. My wife's cut was closer to medium well. Our server checked in with us and I confirmed she put the order in for medium rare and she said yes. She looked at the Steak and agreed it was not medium rare. She offered to have another Steak made for me but I declined. (I do not like to have food sent back to the cook who may take offense and give me a \"special\" recipe, I have watched the movie Waiting one to many times.). The mac and cheese was very good and I felt the cream spinach was salty but the wife disagreed. We were celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary and the server brought us a comp desert. The butter cake appeared to have a burnt section and tasted the same. What really helped me decide to never come back is the manager or cook never came to our table to apologize for the over cooked meat. With the prices and atmosphere they have you would expect at least that much. They have a lot of great reviews which is why we went here but our experience was bad enough to prevent us from returning in the future.

I would like to add that I received a response less then two hours after I posted my review.  I agree the server offered to resolve the problem right away and I declined, that's on me. However with so many great options in Las Vegas second chances are unlikely. Thank you for your response."}
{"text":"Outstanding top notch! Great service Great food! I said all that I really wanted to say about the restaurant but I don't want to go in as a tip so it's a great place"}
{"text":"stop by there for lunch had the prime rib sandwich that they're known for it was okay checked into Yelp for the free appetizer thank goodness I asked cuz they only offer the onion strings it's not any appetizer disappointed"}
{"text":"There are plenty of positive reviews prior to 2016, but we paid a lot to be the exception in 2017. First experience was fantastic, but the second experience the opposite, i.e., no bread was served, a long wait on an off peak time for the steaks, the steaks were luke warm, dry, fat was solidified, and served on a plate hotter than the steak itself. Neither one of us could finish  the steaks, just seemed really off., but after the wait and time, we didn't ask for anything and simply wanted the check.  The normal quality standards seemed completely gone that day, plus seemed a waste of money, only 200 dollars. Despite managements apology, we no longer had time to wait for another steak, and honestly, wouldn't want to.  I'd rather have management ensure quality standards and service standards rather than offer an insincere apology.  Consistently expensive but inconsistent quality based on our experience."}
{"text":"Went yesterday after shopping with my husband and 2 year old. We were seated promptly and drinks came on time. Our server was knowledgeable with the menu items. We ordered the rainbow roll to start. It came out and we tried it, the salmon was not fresh so I spit it out and put it back on the dish. My husband tried the tuna and did the same. I told my husband \"I don't want to get sick\". We advised our server and he took it back. When he came back we told him we wanted our check. He then said that his executive chef and manager tasted it and it was fine. Why would he argue with a customer? Next, we were seated where you can see the reflection of the kitchen and our sent back roll was being eaten by the waitstaff and cooks. That is disgusting. It should have gone in the trash and coming from a health department view, (which is our business) is a dismay. Not to mention, no manager came to visit our table. I guess he was eating the remaining sushi roll. When our server dropped our check for the drinks he said \"go jets\" sarcastically since he was a Patriots fan. I can't believe how disappointed I was as we wanted to try other entrees at another time."}
{"text":"Tried Larsen's Friday night and it far exceeded expectations. Dry aged filet mignon was as good as it gets. Thai salad had a nice flavor and generous amount of steak. Creme brule was above average, but key lime pie was outstanding! On top of all that, the staff was first rate. This place seems very well managed and attentive to detail. What a great addition to Galleria!"}
{"text":"Hubby & I went for lunch. 
Had the fried onion appetizer with barbecue sauce, the top was a little salty, but once we got past that layer they were right on.
Both our salads were tasty, I had the chopped salad with house vinaigrette while he had a Caesar.
Main course, 
Wow, just delicious, I had the filet with garlic mashed potatoes. Yummy
Hubby had a steak also with grilled asparagus, forget which one haha, I was to busy eating mine to notice.
And honestly I think service is just such a big part of a meal for me, and our waiter Jeff brought it!
He was friendly, funny, a bit of a smart ass in the best way, and didn't breathe down our necks, but kept our drinks filled, and boxed our leftovers.
Bravo Jeff, Thank You"}
{"text":"My boyfriend treated me to an amazing Valentine's day dinner here the other night. I was a bit worried it wouldn't be nice considering it was apart of the Galleria Mall, but I was surely mistaken. 

The hostess was very friendly upon our arrival and sat us promptly. It did take a minute for our waiter to arrive and get our check at the end of the night but it was Valentine's Day so you could tell they were rather busy. Other than that he was great. 

Apps: 
Bacon wrapped shrimp $21 - 4 out of 5 stars. Wish there were more for the price.
Crab cakes $21 - 5 out of 5. AMAZING. Great size, there was a generous amount of crab (most places pack them with breadcrumbs) and the sauce... THE SAUCE, just to die for.

Drinks:
Raspberry Martini - A little to sweet for my liking, but still very delicious
R21 Old Fashion - So strong it makes your hairs stand up, but that's how we like it!

Entree:
NY Strip rare - cooked to perfection, great seasoning
Filet Mignon rare - again also cooked to perfection, lacking a bit in the seasoning

Dessert:
Creme Brûlée - it was delicious, not the best I've had but also rather tasty

Total bill was around $180 which wasn't bad for the quality of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here yesterday and absolutely loved it.  Great atmosphere!

My wife had a glass of wine and I had a red ale on tap.

We started out with the artichoke dip which was very good.

I had the filet dry aged medium rare oscar style at it was amazing.  My wife had the filet wet aged and she love it too.  Ordered the green beans and butternut squash which were both excellent.

Great date dinner place in Henderson.  Good job Larsen's."}
{"text":"Really nice quiet place with soft music and amazing NY Steak.. the Malbec wine was the best.. will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Udon noodle salad was spicy the meat was super tender and moist. Greens were fresh! 

Bacon wrapped shrimp was not the best I'd had. It disappointingly  tough. I'm wondering if the bacon should be par cooked before wrapping it around raw shrimp. As crunchy as the bacon was... No wonder the shrimp was like a dry /sponge like!"}
{"text":"I would give this place ten stars if I could...We had happy hour in their bar, my first time to Larsen's Grill. I live in Henderson and my friend suggested going there for a glass of wine. I AM SO SORRY IT TOOK ME THIS LONG TO DISCOVER THIS PLACE!!! We had the STEAK TACO's ($10) and PRIME RIB SLIDERS which came with au jus for dipping and a wonderful horseradish sauce on the side, a lovely salad and several glasses of their house Cabernet. To say it was outstanding is an understatement. The steak, grilled mushrooms flavor was incredible and like velvet in the mouth. WOW...
There were about four people in the bar taking care of us, each one coming up to see how we were doing....Our server was Brianna and she is the one who suggested the steak tacos. Excellent service!! She even offered to take us on a little tour to see their private dining room. It was beautiful, cozy and warm with dark wood walls and beautiful chandeliers. 
Another nice touch was all the small red pointsettia plants on the tables and the Christmas tree was decorated with real class.
The bar reminded me of places I used to go in Seattle. Kind of like the \"Cheers\" bar with dark wood walls, small booths where you can dine, and really pretty lighting.
I can't wait to go back and will be bringing all of my friends to be sure..."}
{"text":"Wet aged steaks. Have you tried it yet? Please do so! At Larsen's they serve wet aged beef, which is an additional aging process after the dry aging. The extra step creates a super moist cut of meat that melts in your mouth.

My daughter and I had lunch here while shopping at the Galleria. I just need to say this before I forget.... There is a supreme being! Finally, a decent place to eat at the mall. There. Done. So anyhow, we stopped in for lunch and the staff was super friendly- from the host to our server. Our server was very knowledgeable and sold us on the steaks and the wet aging process. I made my meal a high protein-low carb deal by ordering the fillet mignon salad. It was picture worthy and tasted as good as it looked. The salad was a generous size of fresh greens, avocado, dollops of goat cheese and the wet aged fillet mignon tossed in a basalmic dressing. I have to say the fillet mignon was moist, it was really moist and just flaked with a fork. Top notch preparation!!

I'm thinking I may need to take several more trips to the mall soon only to have an excuse to eat at Larsen's again. I definitely want to try more that they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Went to Larson's on a business trip.  I got the Roast Beef dip sandwich.  Best roast beef dip I've ever had!  Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance are amazing here. Came to celebrate my best friend's birthday and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here 2 weeks ago and it was fabolous. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. It is pricey but totally worth every penny. The ambiance is perfect. We really loved it there."}
{"text":"Just had the New Year's Eve dinner and it was very good. I had the lobster and garlic mashed potatoes. I would recommend everyone, the restaurant is brand new and all our dinner were very good.  Our waiter was a little odd, kept forgetting what we asked for light sugar for my iced tea, bringing our check while my friend was still eating her steak, and didn't even ask if we wanted any dessert."}
{"text":"Gave this restaurant a second chance recently. Another bad batch of food. Another bad batch of customer service. The drinks are good."}
{"text":"The steaks and the sea bass were great. The 4 of us were very pleased. Two of us live in Sacramento and this was our best meal in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Larsens Grill is amazing. Shannon was our server and was very helpful. Her recommendations helped us decide on our dinner choices. The food and atmosphere is awesome, highly recommended."}
{"text":"First: I don't usually love steakhouses. AND, I'm super hard on them when it comes to ratings (as a previous manager of The Range Steakhouse at Harrah's)... BUT, this place really exceeded my expectations. Let's start with the EXTREMELY attentive and friendly staff. From the guy who took my reservation over the phone, to the cute and smiley hostess, to the surprisingly knowledgeable server (Michael), down to the manager who checked on our table and thanked us again as we left (Do they think we're celebrities?!).  We had the Filet Mignon Sashimi appetizer (served on the most decadent mashed potatoes), and it was wonderful. I would come back and order this as an entree anytime. We had the Caesar Salad... crispy and fresh lettuce, excellent dressing... Simple and perfect. I had the dry aged 16oz. Rib Eye, medium rare... This thing was amazing. It had a perfect salty sear on the outside, and it was cooked to perfection. I got the 5 cheese Mac & Cheese to go with it... divine. My friend had the Miso Glazed Sea Bass.... Holy cow. It was huge! Moist and flakey inside, crispy on the outside.  Served on a massive bed of rice that was covered with the most delicious creamy sauce... Don't even know what it was, but I would pour it on my cereal, it was THAT good. Overall, go here. You'll be impressed."}
{"text":"Lured over here by Bethany's review, I came for a date night with my guy and was pleasantly surprised to see this upscale steakhouse spot attached to the Galleria mall- complete with valet parking.

FILET MIGNON SASHIMI: Surprisingly tasty and imaginative! I have no idea why this spot has sushi on their menu, but this dish bridges the sushi and steak offerings in a clever way with a seared presentation served on a mountain of wasabi potatoes. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would.
CHOP SALAD: Generous portion, easily sharable. Toppings include garbanzo beans, tomatoes, cheese, bacon (maple glazed and spiced with Cayenne?), and avocado. 
HERB CRUSTED ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST: Despite coming here based on a review for the stuffed chicken breast, I ended up opting for this version. The mushroom cream sauce is delicious, I just wish there was more of it. Portion is huge, given sides are wild rice and glazed carrots. I subbed the mac for the rice since that dish is rarely remarkable anywhere. The carrots were tasty but the glaze gets into every other component and adds an unnecessary maple sweetness to everything it touches. Maybe side these separately.
FIVE CHEESE MACARONI: An indulgent baked version with penne pasta, ample creamy sauce included. I'm not generally a fan of baked macs because they tend to be dry, but this version was exceptional. 
NY STRIP STEAK: Because you gotta order at least one steak at a steak house. Got the wet-aged at the suggestion of our server, it was nicely crusted and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Side of asparagus was tasty, sauce and other add-ons (bleu cheese, onions, mushrooms, etc.) are unnecessary. Meat was super tender and full of flavor.

We were so full even with takeout boxes that we opted against dessert, but they have a large selection. They offer half-off wine by the bottle on Wednesdays, which we may have to come back to try. Note that they also have a selection of wine on tap! Service from Neil was attentive and knowledgeable, with plenty of suggestions- request him specifically.

TIP: They have a \"piano hour\" (their version of HH) with app and drink specials on the patio, lounge, and bar area. Worth a shot for light bites."}
{"text":"Today's bartender Daniel (the bald guy) was great. I really appreciate that he brought me a glass of water before when I sat down. I really enjoyed his service. I hope management knows, that there definitely attention to detail with him. This type of service is what will have me visit your restaurant again and that time I will bring my family and friends. I didn't catch the bartenders name, but I was service today between 7pm to 7:30pm."}
{"text":"Our sever was awsome.  Food was great. Very nice decor. Will def come back. We ordered the artichoke stuffed chicken. Was very good and the creme brûlée was the best. Good wine selection and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The salad topped with filet preceded by crab cakes has become my new favorite lunch!  Friends always appreciate the great service by authentically nice people.  And the margarita is the only one worth ordering at a non-Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas IMHO."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food is great and at times spectacular. Ask when the fish arrived as the same day preparations taste amazing! The service is always so crazy wonderful. The staff is warm friendly inviting and cater to all your needs."}
{"text":"Larsens is an awesome addition to the henderson area!  Loved the bar decor and the ribeye and crab cake are amazing .  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"1 star for ambiance/venue but overall disappointing.   Had Valentine's Day Lunch Reservations and both my mom and I ordered the Cobb Salad.  It was as small as a dinner salad with 3 small pieces of turkey in the entire salad and no candied pecans as described on the menu, dressing was also different than what was described on menu.  Left hungry, completely overpriced for the meal we got.  Waitress was nice but never came back to check on us after we received our food."}
{"text":"Lunch at Larsens was Lovely!

Located at the Galleria Mall it's an easy find.  We stopped in on a weekend during lunch hours.  It wasnt too busy at all so we were greeted and seated immediately.   There is a very comfortable dining setting.  They have patio dining as well when the weather cools down.  

Our waiter was awesome.  He was very professional and attentive.  He had a great understanding of the background of Larsens along with the menu.  

I decided to try their stuffed chicken.  It was lightly breaded filled with artichokes, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and cheese.   The portion size was enormous.  I think they used two large chicken breasts which provided enough for me to have two more leftover meals.  The ingredients gave it a wonderful flavor.  I was happy with the lighter breading as well.   The accompanying sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus were also good.  Again it was a large side of mashed potatoes that I easily shared.   

We enjoyed a lovely meal and would be more than happy to come back."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with some friends. Service was great and the food was good. We split appetizers - wedge salad, house salad, sliders, garlic Parmesan fries. Everything was tasty. I appreciated that I had the option to have my wedge salad chopped in the kitchen. (I love them but find them of tricky to cut and eat without calling attention to myself.)"}
{"text":"Recently went to Larsens. Ordered the Tuna tartare it was good. My husbands NY was the wet aged and not good. Bread only on request and after the first basket it is $2.00 a basket. After dinner I ordered coffee which I'm sure is from a machine. It tasted awful and was lukewarm and when I asked the server if she could bring the coffee pot to warm it up she said they didn't bring the pot but took my coffee cup back to the kitchen and brought another which was the same as the first. So if they have a party of 6 or 8 and want their coffee refilled or warmed they have to take 8 cups off the table back to the kitchen and bring them all back. That would so undermine the service. Also their red wine was way too cold. I know it should be kept at a certain temp but this was way too cold. It lessened my experience with this expensive bottle. Overall paying for bread, terrible coffee, extra cold wine and poor quality steaks do not make for a top notch steakhouse."}
{"text":"Great herb roasted chicken, same for the carrots and mashed potatoes. Beautiful room with great service, very enjoyable dinner without any feeling of being rushed. Wife's salad was great, all produce was very fresh in taste and appearance."}
{"text":"Dineer with wife and kids.  Service was really good.  Unfortunately. I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad.  Well, 3 days of food poisoning is what I got.  Either the Ahi was bad or the salad was bad.  The dressing was so heavy that is all you could taste."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  So happy to have a wonderful restaurant so close to home! Service was excellent and food was exceptional!  The filet was probably the best steak I have ever had! 
The atmosphere is nice, they have a really great happy hour and a beautiful out door covered patio where some tables have their own little fire pits in front. Will definitely be back! 
If you haven't been here yet... GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Just by chance we were looking for a restaurant that ended up to be closed, and decided to check out something new (to us). I've heard of Larsen's from trips back home, but never tried them. Upon walking in my friend and I were extremely pleased with the decor and were with warm smiles and pleasant greetings. We decided to eat in the bar area and where we met Dan, the bartender. He took our drink order and enthusiastically and questions about the menu were asked.         We started with filet mignon shashimi, which made us both Mmmmm with pleasure. Aside from the tenderness of cuts, I couldn't stop enjoying the wasabi mashed potatoes they rested on. Somehow we both ordered the prime roast beef dip sandwich, my friend with a side of asparagus, me with creamed spinach. The sandwiches couldn't have been made any better. From the tenderness of the beef to a perfect crunch of the chiabata, it's the only thing we weren't picking off f each other's plates."}
{"text":"We had a small wedding dinner on Friday November 11, 2016. Alex and her staff did an  amazing job to attend and accommodate all of my wishes. My son and my new daughter in law loved the dinner as well as our guests. Stacy was our server and she was awesome and efficient. She was a wonderful server and her personality was amazing and beautiful. I love this restaurant for a nice lunch, beautiful dinner casual or a beautiful celebration. We eat here regularly and we are always satisfied when we do."}
{"text":"Don't write this place off because of it's location. I did for a long time and finally was coerced into going here, and what a pleasant surprise! Also, although we did not make Happy Hour, I noticed that it seemed like a steal, so adding it to my mental list.

The drinks were good. Not amazing. However, they didn't really stand a chance against all the craft cocktail lounges and speakeasy's with their mustachioed \"mixologists\". But for a steakhouse I enjoyed them and didn't feel like I wasted my money. My husband was not a fan of his Old Fashioned at all and that is his go to cocktail. So maybe avoid that one. 

The climax of this review is obviously the wedge salad. Now, I've heard rumors about the wedge here and nothing could have prepared me for the nirvana it created in my mouth. Wedges usually don't vary much besides the quality of the dressing and the blue cheese, but Larsen's does it better. The blue cheese was creamy and high quality and the dressing was not overly blue cheese flavored, so you could taste the rest of the ingredients. The bacon was packed with flavor, crunchy and melted in your mouth. But the one thing that topped the other toppings were the candied walnuts. They were smokey and sweet. The perfect thing to take a wedge over the edge.

The meat was cooked to specification, since my husband likes his steaks well-done, (BLASPHEMY I know) sometimes we run into issues. But all steaks were cooked perfectly to each person's preference. The flavor was great as well. We ordered the mac & cheese, maple-glazed carrots, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. I also had the Caprese salad, which they gladly added greens to with no extra charge. All of the sides were fantastic, although the maple bacon glazed carrots were a little odd. The flavor was there, after we had to peel them from the puddle of hardened, caramelized, maple syrup, which additionally got stuck in our teeth. The amount of carrots was also a little lacking. 

All in all I was pleasantly surprised with Larsen's and will definitely be returning for happy hour and regular dinner hours. I would love to try out their gorgeous patio on a warmer evening as well."}
{"text":"As always this place never disappoints me.  Here at happy hour had sliders, Parmesan garlic fries and Mack and cheese.   Absolutely delicious.      Atmosphere  the view spectacular
Adam has a great attitude and conversation.   Definitely recommend this place and will be returning.   He cannot go wrong with anything on the menu recommend everything if you're looking for a nice evening out quiet romantic beautiful this is your place the hidden gem in Henderson.    Thanks again Adam"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely remarkable. My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day and the ambiance, food, and service were all spectacular. If you ask for Michael Braswell. He took great care of us and was very well-versed in steaks ;-)"}
{"text":"I wanted to bring a friend and co-worker out for a food steak while here in Vegas, staying in Henderson and found Larson's through Yelp.  Very enjoyable, dry aged ribeye, nice Silverado Cab!  Service was great with Starla!  Will return again!"}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday afternoon, and were the first patrons for the day. Restaurant is beautifully decorated. Server was prompt, polite and went through the menu thoroughly he even went over the children's selections as we were not provided kids menus. 
Caprese salad was delicious the mozzarella was probably made in house, and was a different texture than usual mozzarella but had great flavor. 
Kids chicken fingers were served quickly and were a hit with the kids. 
For the main course hubby had the hamburger which he said was delicious. It was big, thick and juicy. It wasn't medium well as he had ordered, it was served well done. But the flavor was still good. 
Spicy tataki roll was a total disappointment. The seasoning on the top overwhelmed the flavor of the fish and detracted from the roll. Rice to fish ratio was too high, so as the roll is really large it is mostly rice. 

On the service side, gentleman was lovely. Our only observation was that we were interrupted too frequently. We were trying to have a conversation and were continuously interrupted for one reason or another. We would take one drink of water and they would rush over to refill. There is a fine balance between attentive service and invasive service. This was invasive. It would be nice if they paid more attention to guest cues to know that we wanted the opportunity to enjoy each other."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio real nice and relaxing...and romantic....Went for happy hour. Kind of pricey. Had the fish tacos...not the best and way too much for happy hour  $9 for 2...good service."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent service! 5 stars for sure. The atmosphere is quite quaint, dim, and intimate. Make sure you get the server Jeff, our waiter took very good care of us. 

Very good wine choices

Outside patio has fire pits to sit near by. But it was too cold for us to sit out there. It would be idea for fall season though

The bathrooms are super clean and the sinks have mouth wash and lotion for ladies who are on a fancy date, or for this who just want to freshen up"}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a great steakhouse close to home without the drive to our favorite places near the Strip. 

Our waiter Neal went above and beyond to make our first experience there a good one. The filet and rib eye were on par with our favorite steak houses so I would definitely recommend Larsen's to others out looking for a something new near home."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Larsen's Grill! The meals were wonderful and beautifully presented! The service was incredible!  The atmosphere feels like a very classy lodge.  I can't wait to go back
when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour - Can't Wait to Go Back.
We have been procrastinating going for happy hour since Larsen's open in Galleria Mall but we finally went last night.  The food was just excellent.  Great portions, lots of variety for happy hour.  If there was one flaw; we would really have liked to see something beside chardonnay on happy hour.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome!   My husband and I were celebrating our 38th wedding anniversary.  The restaurant welcomed us with a happy anniversary card signed by the staff.  The meal was excellent and the server brought us a wonderful and tasty dessert!  I highly recommend Larsen's Grill in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Went back to Larsen's after the owner and general manager responded to my previous review. They wanted to understand what my experience was and try to improve. So we went back this evening. First I must say I was mis informed when I thought this was supposed to be a high end steakhouse. That is not this restaurants model. So this time I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which the waiter highly recommended. It was DELICIOUS!!! My husband ordered the dry aged filet mignon(again) and he enjoyed it.  The sides with our meals were properly seasoned and very good. Ordered the apple pie for dessert and again it was very good! As before, the service and staff were excellent and treated us very well. We will go back again and I recommend that more of my Henderson neighbors give it a shot! Thank you to the owner and general manager for making an effort to reach out to your clients!"}
{"text":"We went to Larsen's Grill in Henderson for a belated BD dinner. The atmosphere was nice, they have only been open for a few days so they didn't have everything on the menu. (only reason I didn't give 5 stars) I was looking forward to prime rib.... Who doesn't have prime rib.

Attire is whatever you are wearing, very casual.

I had the tri-tip and ribs BBQ plate with a fully loaded baked potato. The tri-tip was so tender and the rack of ribs were very tasty.

Our server was very professional and knowledgable. My ice tea glass was never empty.

I'm going back, these assured me they would have prime rib soon."}
{"text":"Menu was nice. Steak was very good. Prices are a bit above average, but he food was very tasty."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here for our first time and it being a new restaurant in the neighborhood. We sat outside on patio and the ambiance was great. I love how they have fire pits and tv, great for football days. Our server was Neil and he was great very attentive, recommended all the right stuff. It was my dad and my bday celebration dinner and they have us both cards signed by the staff, that was very thoughtful! The sea bass was amazing, fish thick cut tasted real clean. Miso sauce on rice was a plus! The porkchop was great too, tasted like a steak! It was huge but tender. My dad ordered the porterhouse it was cooked nicely but tasted bitter to us, must have been the grilled onions and mushrooms on it? Overall drinks and food were so good! We will return again esp for happy hour. The menu for happy hour has something for everyone, includes wedge salad which was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! My second time here and both times the food was great and the service was second to none! The drinks are ALL wonderful! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great experience. Came during happy hour. There was an amazing piano player. 7 dollar Chardonnays, crab cake $9 (one crab cake), wedge salad $7. Not exactly cheap but upscale, food was excellent. Service was attentive, Dan was super friendly. 

It was a little tricky to find, it's attached to the Galleria but entrance is on the outside. Southwest side of mall."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I was very impressed.  We went at about 7pm on a Tuesday and it was not crowded at all.   I think even if it was, the service would have been excellent, however.

We started off with a couple Chopped Salads...and wow!  Easily in the top three of salads I've ever had.  Generous portions of avocado, artichoke hearts...and like ten other things with the blue cheese dressing perfectly tossed in.  If I was in a salad mood, I may well come here just for this...goodbye to Sweet Tomatoes forever!

I enjoyed the Full Rack of Pork Ribs and can say with confidence it was one of the best I've ever tried.  Very generous trimming and falling off the bone slow cooked tender with excellent sauce.  One side included, I chose the five cheese macaroni, in retrospect a pretty bland choice, but it was nicely prepared for what it was with bread crumbles on top.

My girlfriend had the wet aged Filet Mignon with creamed spinach as the side.  The steak was perfection and the spinach was a very generous portion.

All in all it was an excellent experience.  The decor of this new restaurant is over the top great.  This would be a great place for a date."}
{"text":"Welcome to my neighborhood Larsen's. I will be the first to say I am very happy to have a semi upscale steakhouse in the area. 
My first visit, I was quite under dressed and had no idea what to expect. However I was welcomed, and had a great experience. 
Trip #2, was a double date, and being dressed appropriately, ordering the best steaks, and a round of cocktails gets you a personal visit from the owner, and a  dessert on the house. 
I have been lucky enough to try the dry aged filet, the prime rib, the ribeye, the herb crusted chicken, the wedge salad, the chili- also made with filet, the bacon wrapped shrimp, the mash potatoes, and mac and cheese. For dessert I have tried the peanut butter/chocolate pie, the apple pie, and the crème brulee.
I would order every single item again. It was all high quality, fresh food. The extensive knowledge by the server is an added plus to an already great atmosphere. There is a beautiful and huge balcony for outdoor dining. Even the bathrooms were luxurious, offering sprays and mouthwash. 
The service has been spot on both visits. Very attentive and friendly staff. 
I have intentions of being a regular here. Even if its just for a quick happy hour cocktail."}
{"text":"I took a client here for lunch and am really impressed. I had the seafood salad and she had the ahi salad. Perfectly dressed, perfect portion size. I can't wait to come back and try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, and the food is indescribable. I have eaten at steak houses across the United States, and so far, this is my number one choice. Had a beef tri-tip and mushroom soup to start, followed by the dry aged, grass-fed filet, and the house made butter cake with cream and strawberries, for dessert. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good lunch and finally something new at the Galleria Mall. Had the Lobster Roll and it was amazing, also their hamburger called \"The Burger\" was so tasty and juicy."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive. Service was good. Don't understand why they charge for bread. I didn't like the sweet maple bacon on the wedge said. Prefer the wedge salad at Brio instead."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service sucked, We sat at the bar"}
{"text":"Great spot to come, relax and enjoy delicious food! Everything on the menu to wonderful. Filet melts in your mouth. The bread is warm and fresh. Clam chowder, lobster roll, prime roast dip sandwich, wedge salad incredible. The staff is warm and friendly. Atmosphere is perfect! Nice to have a steakhouse near by. Recommend to all."}
{"text":"For being in a mall, this place is nice! Great food and a nice, open feel bar. Even the bathrooms are outstanding. Minus one star for high prices and no happy hour."}
{"text":"We ate there tonight for a special birthday celebration. The food was mediocre, from the spinach artichoke dip that may only have contained essence of artichoke. My prime rib tasted like Select grade beef. We had eaten at the Steakhouse in Circus Circus last Friday night and will always go back for superior service and meat.
The worst part of experience tonight was our sarcastic, rude, condescending waiter Neil Erickson. As soon as I tried to order a glass of wine he was so hostile, it took all I had not to call a manager and ask for a different server.
I hope management contacts me about Neil, how he needs serious coaching and retraining.

Follow up : I just got off the phone with Tyler, who was quite earnest in receiving my feedback. He was surprised to hear what my concerns were, offered to talk to our server Neil and in hopes, we will return, is sending us a Gift Card. I feel, based upon Tyler's response, that we will return for HH, because as you all can probably see, the YELP reviews on Larsen's
are overwhelmingly positive."}
{"text":"We recently held our 50th wedding anniversary dinner party at Larsen's Steakhouse in Henderson.  The accommodations and food were outstanding and exceeded our expectations for this special night.  A sincere thanks to the manager Jeff and our head server Neil.  We would highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was in June for my mother's birthday.  While I cannot recall our server's name, we were greeted immediately and got drinks very quickly.  He also provided excellent recommendations on appetizers and entrees.  For appetizers we went with the Lobster crunch roll and the bacon wrapped shrimp, and let me just say that they were both so amazing I almost wished I would have just ordered one of each for myself instead of sharing.  We had the following entrees; Chardonnay Salmon, Roasted Chicken, and Tri Tip, while I didn't get to try all of them there was definitely no complaints.  Aside from the food the service was incredible, never was there an empty drink or dirty dish, on top of that every employee in the restaurant seemed to genuinely love their job and actually wanted to ensure that we had a great dining experience.

With our first meal being such a wonderful experience when my husband was setting up a business dinner, we immediately thought of this place.  While there on our first visit we noticed a private room with approximately enough room for 14, about a week or two later we walked into Larsen's to check and see if we could make a reservation for 12ppl for the private room.  The hostess went and got the manager for us and he personally booked the private room for us.  We arrived for our dinner on Friday, and while I could go into the whole experience and how amazing it was, that would take a lot of typing.  Everyone enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere so much that about 5 hours later after far too many drinks, food, and talking we didn't even realize that they were actually trying to close.  However, the reason we did not notice was because they did not come in and try to force us to leave in anyway...in fact they were still making sure we had drinks and anything else we needed!!!  The following day, my husband actually got a call from Larsen's to ensure that our evening went well, I didn't even know restaurants did this?!!  

Well done Larsen's.  If your looking for great food, service, and atmosphere please put this restaurant at the top of your list to try.  We will be back soon.

On a side note, I actually signed up for yelp just to write this review."}
{"text":"We live in Henderson and honestly, we have to drive towards the Strip or Summerlin if we want a great tasting steak for dinner. We decided to try Larsens last week and enjoyed our meals so much that we came back tonight for another try. On our first visit I had the wet aged Filet and my husband had the dry aged Ribeye. Both were flavorful but if you enjoy the grill flavor and marbling order the ribeye. The filet is fork cutting tender...you don't need a knife to cut it and more mild in flavor. Leftover, the filet was just as good. 

Tonight we shared a wedge salad which was amazing and the filet mignon sandwich with the macaroni and cheese. Enough food for both of us and we were stuffed. I didn't really enjoy the apple pie though. Looking forward to trying the key lime pie next time. We'll be weekly regulars!! Jeff is the Best Server! Henderson's hidden gem."}
{"text":"A great bar plus great food sums up to a great experience.  Larsen's is one of those restaurants that caters to budgets or limitless expense.  The service is fantastic, the restaurant is pristine, and the food, great.

We started with sweet white wine. It was crisp and so easy to drink. The caramel apple on the label said it all to us. We drank 2 bottles during our meal.

We started with artichokes and crab cakes. The crab cakes had a great aioli and good flavor. The artichokes were nicely charred and the aioli was amazing. One of the artichokes had a cold heart but we didn't complain because we had a schedule to keep to get out at a certain time for a movie. Still, 2 of the 3 artichoke halves were hot and tasty. 

My husband and I both had their burger and fries.  The patties were juicy, flavorful, and everything on top of the burger were classic. We figured carryover would cook my burger more, so we ordered medium. It arrived well done. No complaints brought up to thr server since it tasted very good and was still very juicy. It's one of those messy eats, which is the way burgers should be. Their fries are some of the best I've had. They're fluffy and crispy, perfectly portioned, and seasoned well. The main course was an overall 3.5.

Personally, I don't have them on my top 10 as a go-to, but I appreciate the great portion sizes and good flavors. Don't let my experience sway you not to go. Larsen's should be one of those \"must try\" restaurants because they are more than burgers and artichokes. I say give it a try for what they're known for--steak.

Maybe we will go back in 6 months once they're more settled to try their signature dishes."}
{"text":"Much better this time....much much better. The food was good and the service was prompt. When we were here 7 months ago, it was nothing short of a disaster"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Had a reservation on Valentine's day at 8, we were told it would be another 25 mins. Didn't actually get seated until 845!!( However the front of the house made up for the wait by giving us a free glass of sparkling wine) 

Ok. Ordered 2 glasses of wine and the waiter only brought 1, said she would get the other and never did. I really didn't feel like reminding her so whatever.... my husband and I both ordered the special  which was 6 oz steak and a small lobster tail plus 1 side. Both ordered our steaks med rare and I ordered mash potatoes and he ordered Brussel sprouts. Oh and we also ordered Caesar salads too... salads came first and they were ok.. the dressing was super acidic but edible. The restaurant gave us this garlic butter bread ball thing... whew! So much garlic it almost knocked our socks off....  and then the main course... we both received mashed potatoes, which was wrong... said something to the food runner and with an attitude she replied \" well I guess I can run a quick order for you\"  we passed.. my husbands steak was definitely med well( disgusting)  and the lobster tail was wayyyyy too salty!!  My steak was medium but edible. However the mashed potatoes were absolutely digusting!!!!! Seriously tasted like it came from a box!  Dry as can be, no flavor at all! 

We will never come back to this waste of space and I will tell everyone to avoid this train wreck they call a \"steak house \""}
{"text":"We were there tonight for my birthday dinner.  Food was awesome!  Neil our server is the best!  We all highly recommend this place and can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my sisters and sons birthday and I must say I wasn't impressed. The restaurant is beautiful... The staff was very friendly except the guy that took my reservation. I called earlier and asked for a reservation at 6:30 he was like \"Thank god you called because we get busy\"! Hmm really?! The place was dead.  We started off with cocktails which were good. I had the Lemon Basil Martini. My sister and son had the Jalapeno Strawberry margarita which was also very good if you like a kick to your margarita. For appetizer we had the onion peel which I liked alot! It wasn't oily like other places which I loved! We ordered salads which does not come with your dinner. I figured it would be a good size salad...it wasn't. It was small and the presentation was horrible. For $9-13 salads I would expect a little more. For the main course I had the dry aged Filet Mignon with creamed spinach. Now I'm sorry but for $50.00 I expect great quality with great flavor. It was bland and definitely not prime meat. The cream spinach was bland...zero flavor. My sister and son had the Prime Rib and they weren't impressed as well. Honestly I think the prices are too high for the quality of the food. Again the restaurant itself is nice but the prices are ridiculous. Oh...also if you order more bread they charge you $2.00! Really???!"}
{"text":"We were looking to try something new in the area and wandered in. I'm not a food snob, but I am a picky eater, so new places scare me.

I wasn't looking for a $200 dinner, so we ordered the prime rib french dip and the filet sandwiches. We commented that we were going to split them so we could try them both. The waiter was excellent and had them plated that way for us.

I liked them both very much. I liked the filet sandwich best. The mixture of flavors are just right. 

We finished the meal with cheesecake that was fresh and amazing. My husband was fond of the selection of whisky.

I recommend trying this restaurant! They are upscale from Outback but not as fancy as Hanks."}
{"text":"Perfect steaks, amazing service - friendly but unobtrusive. Great happy hour menu. This is an amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service and a lovely restaurant! I really liked the bbq tri-tip AND the mac&cheese!!!"}
{"text":"One word: confused.  We decided to dine here tonight after looking for a more upscale but comfortable dining option.  We noticed online the menus did not have pricing on them however found it to be reasonably priced when we got to the restaurant.  

We sat at the bar which had 5 gaming machines in total.  The female who served us at the bar seemed like it was her first day or she could have just been really awkward.  We ordered wine to start, off the tap, was very unique.  The server had to ask another member of the team behind the bar which tap the Chardonnay was.  We then ordered a Caesar salad and a spicy tuna tataki roll to start.  When asking about the variety of salads they offered the server said that she believed the Caesar wasn't chopped which I thought was bizarre.  The sushi came out and was presented beautifully however the taste was not there.  Sub par to say the least.  The rolls were a decent size however it was mostly rice and you couldn't really taste the spicy tuna it just left you with a very bland taste.

I then ordered a filet with Mac & Chz and my company ordered the stuffed chicken with Brussel sprouts.  The server didn't offer any sauce to go with my steak so finally when the steak came out I had to ask for a sauce which was an additional cost.  Additionally, the server didn't write any of this down and had to come back to verify the sides.  

The stuffed chicken wasn't what you would envision when you hear stuffed chicken.  It was two chicken breasts with vegetables and cheese in the middle.  The Brussel sprouts were not bad and the Mac and cheese was on point!  The filet was the perfect size and cooked just to my liking.

To make this dining experience even more bizarre, halfway through the meal our server left and we had a new one without the first server excusing herself.  We didn't mind as the second server was much more savvy!  

The ambiance was on point.  I loved the bottle displays on the bar and the fireplace in the dining area.  The restaurant seemed to be a perfect happy hour or dinner spot for a local who wants a nice dinner however it was dead inside.

I would love to give this restaurant a second chance I would probably sit in the dining area this time and perhaps even for the piano happy hour!"}
{"text":"I rate this place 4.5 stars.  My girlfriend and I tried this place Sat night.  The decor was nice and staff friendly and provided great service.  We got the NY steak (cooked medium), roast beef sandwich w/ au jus, wedge salad, spinach dip and garlic mashed potatoes.  Steak was cooked very well and was a good cut. Sandwich and salad were great too.  Spinach dip and garlic mashed were just ok resulting in half point deduction."}
{"text":"We enjoyed drinks and dinner last night .... Drinks in the \"piano\" bar were prepared by each individual server ... They take your drink order and then go make them for you .... Ladies had lemon drop martinis and were very well made irregardless of which server made them ... My Jack on the rocks was a disappointing, very short pour ... Oh well ... Ordered apps in the bar, prime rib sliders were very good, shrimp cocktail not so good! Excellent service in the bar by Stacy ... Nice decor throughout the place, bar, dining area and patio ... Cleared our bar tab and moved to the dining area for dinner ... We had really excellent service  provided by Michael, he could teach other restaurants a thing or two about providing great service! ... We all ordered steaks, more expensive \"dry\" cuts ... One filet, $51, two rib eyes,$59 each .. Filet was rated as good and two rib eyes were not up to our expected quality, definitely not worth the extra cost ... We would not order again ... Too much fat and gristle .. Enjoyed Mac and cheese with added jalapeños and bacon, $2 add-on, very good! They do offer a pretty good wine list ... After dinner coffee not so good ...
Overall it was a really nice dining experience with high quality service provided by the friendly staff!
Four+ stars for the service!"}
{"text":"Your free appetizer yelp check in has to be onion straws.  Very gross.   Beer was good.   But please go to sauce or bravo, WoB, much better yelp deals."}
{"text":"We had a great time and this place had amazing food! Our server was very attentive and had great suggestions to us. We will be back to try the steaks. I had the filet Asian salad. It did have a lot of noodles in it, so didn't exactly taste as healthy as I was looking but that wasn't their fault. 

Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and ordered the prime French dip. Omg, it was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the country, and that dish rivals them all. The meat melts in your mouth, the ciabatta is the perfect accompaniment. Also service was great. This place is a bit costly but the meat is such high quality it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Happy hour was the bomb.com!! Staff was super friendly and food was absolutely off the charts! We had the wedge salad, prime rib sliders, and filet mignon tacos..everything was awesome. All draft beers $5 during happy hour from 5-7, will definitely be back. So many other menu items to try!!!"}
{"text":"We recently visited this restaurant and it was absolutely fantastic! In our group we ordered the prime rib, clam chowder, lobster sushi roll, lobster tail, and \"the\" burger. Every one of us in our party raved about the food! The ambiance of this restaurant is fantastic! We loved the decor, dimmed lighting, and beautiful bar. The service was absolutely incredible, and they even presented us with free dessert at the end of our meal simply because it was our first visit. To make things even better, they actually called us the next day to thank us for visiting their restaurant! The bathroom even has nice towels for you to use, mouthwash, and lotion. You wouldn't expect such a nice place to be at the galleria mall, but it is and it is a gem! I highly recommend visiting this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was lucky to get two stars out of me because the crab cakes were good. However, the atrocious service we received was mind-boggling. One hour and twenty minutes and we weren't served our dinners. I didn't order anything fancy, just stuffed chicken breast. Highly unlikely we are going to return."}
{"text":"We came to Larsen's to try it and we are so glad that we came! Service was stellar. Starla was AWESOME!!  The food was amazing. The lobster roll, garlic mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts and porterhouse ALL perfect!! 
We will be back! Thank you for the amazing meal and service"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Larsen's after reading all of the rave reviews.  We are longtime patrons of Hank's and we figured if we could find the same food and service a little closer to home, why not?  First, the pros: we were seated quickly (we had reservations,) our waiter, I believe his name was Jacob, was wonderful, and our food came out quickly. Also, a day or two after our visit we received a call from the general manager to thank us for coming in and to see if there was anything they could do to make the experience better. I thought that was a nice touch. Unfortunately, I missed the call and heard this on voicemail, or I could have voiced the following concerns to her personally. 

The ambiance is seriously lacking.  While I ate my dinner in our booth, I was looking at a full bar, complete with two large screen TV's, absolutely not what I want to see while paying $200 for dinner.  In hindsight, we could have asked for a different table, so that's on me, but in my humble opinion, the bar area should be separate from the dining area in a fine dining establishment. 

Secondly, our food was mediocre.  We ordered spinach artichoke dip, which came with tortilla chips instead of bread (a minor nitpick, I realize,) but we didn't receive any bread before dinner either so we were disappointed.  The house salad was good. My husband and I both had steaks, his was cooked to perfection but my filet was well done and should have been medium well; there was no hint of pink, slight or otherwise in my steak.  The flavor was decent considering it was broiled to complete doneness, but both steaks were far too salty, and this is coming from a salt lover.  At this point you're probably wondering if we sent our food back, and the answer is no.  As a general rule, I do not send food back; I just don't feel comfortable doing that.  So here I will give them the benefit of the doubt as I'm sure they would have brought us new steaks had we asked.

We each had a cocktail and our bill before gratuity was $185; this is comparable to Hank's pricing but neither the food nor the ambiance came close to Hank's.  Larsen's has the right idea, but there are improvements to be made.  At this price, we will stick with what we know and love; being helped into a plush velvet, round booth where we can sit side by side comfortably, a waitstaff of three amazing waiters, a perfect atmosphere (the bar is separate!) and impeccable food.  If you want an experience worth $200+, I think you could safely skip this steakhouse chain."}
{"text":"Really good service. Good solid food. My filet came out more done than i ordered. Michael offered to get me another but it was still good! It was crusted with some kind of salty seasoning. Came with some baked garlic! The bernaise was a little bland. The artichoke appetizer was good, had a great sauce with it! The drink was good too!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've ever been to, hands down. It was so delicious. My first time I went, they were still selling their green mussels in a butter garlic sauce, and my God it was life changing. The sauce was amazing. Unfortunately, they stopped selling it. At first when our entree came out (filet mignon and mashed potatoes) I was afraid it wasn't going to fill me up, but I was wrong. I was so full after the meal. Plus, our waiter was super helpful, kind, and funny; he was by far the best waiter I've ever had. Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"The ambience is charming and slightly old-school glam the chandeliers mixed with hardwood floors upscale neighborhood bar feeling .  Happy hour is awesome deal from 5 to 7 they have a select menu of delicious food and cocktails.  My favorite happy hour foods are the prime rib sliders, the tomato mozzarella with reduction and pesto, and sometimes the when should salad or garlic fries.   My favorite drink is a sweetened version of the blueberry Martini. The best part is your bartenders know so well we hardly have to speak in order to order because they know us and want to meet our experience the best possible. 

Probably what makes the facility the best are their bartenders.  We personally have to favorites forgive me for not knowing their names however when is a gentleman with the beard another is a young lady with blond hair that she ties in a braid and bun.   

The reason I gave this rating of four instead of five is simply because I think the restaurant should attempt to Relate to a younger crowd   While the regular menu is a little pricey, the happy hour menu is quite affordable. This is the time to draw in a younger crowd maybe 30-45. Since the  restaurant is attached to a mall, this should be a pretty simple task to accomplish especially with the chandelier ambience.   The happy hour should be a main push and should be well advertised outside of the restaurant. 
Finally, the front door girl is very charming, but her role has little to do other than to open the door and seat the very few customers that come in.  She probably should have some other tasks to do to draw in business or maintain the restaurant. Additionally, she must stand at the front near the door behind a desk on a rubber mat. During the times that she is not seating customers a stool would be a more conducive work environment for her.  She could wipe down menus, use iPads and walk around to take customer service surveys from guests, she could fold forks into napkins so that the bartending staff wouldn't be responsible for such duties.  She is wonderful and hard-working don't get me wrong but having her stand on a rubber mat just doesn't seem right. 
This is an awesome restaurant and it can be made fantabulous  and a 5 with a few tweaks. Thanks Larsons we enjoy visiting you!"}
{"text":"I wavered between 3 and 4 stars.  Here's why... Service and wait time were phenomenal- 5 stars, but our food ranged from 2-5 stars.

I made a reservation on Open Table, and we were seated immediately in a nice elevated booth.  Our server arrived right behind the hostess to take our drink order.  The beer came out in a pretty awesome glass I dubbed a punch bowl and they had the clearest (uncloudy) iced tea I have ever seen.  Both were cold and delicious.  

We started with fantastic salads that are large enough to share: WEDGE SALAD $9- Egg, tomatoes, bacon, candied pecans, bleu cheese crumbles and bleu cheese dressing.  Don't tell Fleming's but this is better than their wedge salad! 
CHOP SALAD $8-Romaine and iceberg, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, jack cheese, chopped egg and garbanzo beans tossed in champagne vinaigrette.  Simply delicious.  Lots of different flavors in each bite.

Entrees: PRIME RIB 12oz with garlic mashed $34-the garlic mashed was creamy and flavorful, but the prime rib was very cold when it arrived, fattier than we expected, and slightly overcooked.  They offered to reheat it and it was marginally better, but the flavor was just not that good.  I am not sure if it was a bad cut of meat or an off night, but I don't think it is something we'd order again to find out.

PRIME DRY AGED FILET 8oz with a loaded baked potato $49- the filet was utterly fantastic; a buttery melt in your mouth bliss that I kept eating far after I should have stopped.  Sadly (or luckily since I was full), the potato was pointless.  It was bland and undercooked.  I also ordered a side of broccoli that looked amazing, but was also undercooked.  Very hard.  I wanted a dinner veggie; not crudités.

Desserts: CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER CAKE- Very rich, but very good.  The cake was moist and the whipped cream tasted homemade. We took 95% of this cake to go (sans ice cream) but we wanted to try it at the restaurant.

APPLE PIE- Omg, I think they stole this recipe from my grandmother!  Devine crisp apples, cinnamon, and not overly sweet.  A winner for sure!

Side note; like Fleming's, you can get a $100 gift card at Costco for $79.99.  Built in 20% savings."}
{"text":"I had the wedge salad and the fillet steak. The  salad was good and the filet was good. I feel like I don't really even know what else to say, everything was good but nothing was great. Oh, I also have the garlic mashed potatoes and my date did not want the asparagus that came with their meal so I also had the asparagus. I checked in on Yelp so I received a free dessert and the dessert that they give  was delicious. Yes, my favorite part of dinner was the desert :)"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and the service are all incredible. I've been here multiple times and each experience has been great. It's always very clean and well kept. I've ordered something different each time and never have I been disappointed. I've had the pleasure of having Adam as my bartender each time I've come in. He makes me feel welcome and gives great attentive service. You can tell he enjoys his job and people. He seems to have a lot of regulars and talks to his guests on a personal level. It's fun going in, playing keno and watching football while enjoying good food, drinks and company. The entire staff has always been awesome, especially Adam. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We met my friend here for dinner at her suggestion...could not be more pleased! The service was impeccable while still being friendly and accommodating. The food was fabulouse, I've never seen a burger done like that, and the sushi rolls were done perfectly! Dessert came as a surprise (undercover birthday!) And was...oh my soooo delicious. Thank you Jake for making our evening sweetly perfect!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant numerous times. 
I have never had a really good meal.
It is expensive & food is just average.
The staff is rude...for absolutely no reason.
Snotty. 
Too many people tending one table.
Food runners attempted to bring main course before any appetizer
places were cleared.
No idea who ordered what.

Rude waiter barely did anything."}
{"text":"Woot woot!

We attend one of the Thank Galleria It's Friday event in October.  With our $10 of Galleria gift cards, we headed over to Larsen's with excitement in our hearts (and plenty of booze in our bellies).  

My understanding is that Larsen's is related to Flemming's.  You tell by the quality (and price!).  This is no ordinary evening out.  You will want to savoy each and every bite.  Come hungry and leave fulfilled.  

I had an amazing piece of meat and husband had a burger because he cannot appreciate filet mignon.  

I see a bright future for this establishment in the crowded restaurant corridor of Galleria at Sunset."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food spots in Vegas! Always perfectly cooked steaks with friendly service. Great location for Henderson locals and the venue and overall atmosphere are excellent.

Price is fair for the somewhat higher end dining experience.

Great overall value."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  Ask for Jeff. He was just amazing and made our dinner even more exceptional!  This is our new spot!!   High end dining with a comfortable atmosphere. Felt like I was back in Cali!"}
{"text":"First time at Larsens and can't wait to go back.  We only had time for an appetizer and drink and they were all amazing.  Best crabs cakes and wedge salad I have ever had.  The peartini was delicious!  Atmosphere was very nice and the wait staff was exceptionally efficient and friendly.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Live in Henderson and was looking for a good steakhouse outside of the strip. Tried Larsen's based on the reviews and it didn't disappoint. Had the Porterhouse and Mac and cheese for my side. Both were excellent just wish I would've went medium rare instead of medium. The waiter tried to get me to go medium rare and I didn't listen. My wife had the half chicken and she enjoyed hers.  The portions are good sized as well. The service wasn't the best, but I will let it slide due to it being Valentine's Day and it was extremely busy. I look forward to giving it another try and trying the prime rib"}
{"text":"It's a lovely restaurant and a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but there are some major flaws that need attention. But first kudos to Larsen's landscape architect who gave it the most attractive exterior with access to two levels of parking. As for the flaws, sadly, it's the food that needs some attention if they want to keep guests coming back.  

There are some important steps they're skipping in the kitchen -- most importantly tasting the food before it goes out. That's not happening. A tomato salad with three slices of tomato should have 3 perfect slices of the ripest, juiciest tomatoes ever -- it's summer, this isn't hard. But that didn't happen. They were mealy and tough - large, but totally inedible. The dish was billed as tomato and burrata salad but the cheese was plain old mozzarella - fresh yes, but not burrata. 

Mac & cheese has promise texturally, but was flavorless - how is that possible? 

Best dish was the steak sashimi - cooked rare with a nice sear and served over wasabi mash -- but it was an app and there was enough mash for this to be a main for 2 easily, large enough to be an app for 4 handily. On the plus side: the meat was tender and flavorful plus overall, the dish was good and recommended by our server.

Tuna tartare was HUGE - well presented... but even as a lunch portion by itself, it was huge. And dots of siracha need to be brushes of it, it helps the whole dish, as would some lemon. Tuna was okay, but cut in cubes so large, the mouth feel was off. There wasn't a balance between it and the avocado, but I will say that this was one great avocado. Probably one of the best I've had in a while out  - so why couldn't they ripen that tomato? 

Rotisserie chicken had been sandbagged by the cook a while earlier - so that the skin was rubbery and gummy. Sauce was strangely sweet. Not good.  Again the mash - and tons of it. Only two spears of asparagus. Nice fat ones, but still... 

I hadn't had Chilean Seabass in years because it's not sustainable - but I was curious to see how they handled it. This dish too, was served on a sea of mash, plus the fish had a strange texture. The gold standard is Nobu. And it's been trickling downward for years onto chain menus. Go try it, and you'll see why yours is not up to par. 

I like that traditional steakhouses / grills are serving up lots of other options beyond simple steak. And dishes with sides already composed (but enough with the mash...). It would be great if they stepped up and offered more organic options - but kudos for having one grassfed beef steak on the menu. They had some sushi - but here too, the portions were HUGE. 

I get that every restaurant in America thinks they have to compete with Cheesecake Factory and serve up portions that are enormous, but there's no need for it. 

I didn't get the sense that they had any gluten free options at all. I didn't even bother asking for a menu, but I think today, servers should take it upon themselves to find out when guests sit down if anyone at the table has any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of. And every kitchen should be able to deliver at least two safe meal options - free of any potential allergens. Even if there are only a few limited options, there should be at least two. And every server should know what they are. Period. 

We ordered a ton of food because we like having a chance to get a feel for the place in one fell swoop - even though it typically freaks out the kitchen. But we're flexible and not weirded out by timing - particularly when there seems to be thought put into it. So we asked them to send it out as it was ready - but the food came out so quickly without consideration of coursing appropriate dishes that we weren't really able to enjoy what we already had on the table at proper temps or at a proper pace.  Rookie mistake. So their solution? The table was too full -- so clear dishes! So they tried with every pass - and they passed a lot to take the plates away. Finally when we reached a stopping point, and were actually ready for some to be cleared because we were finally all complete, there was no one in sight, no one watching the table at all. And no one who noticed us trying to flag down anyone. Poof. 

One other odd note: there are a lot of the same liquor bottles behind the bar all lit up intentionally - but instead of contributing to the design, it screamed \"sad chain with poorly stocked bar.\"

And servers, please don't ask \"how are We tonight?\" \"how do we like Our food?\" Awkward. 

Oh and one last note: aging beef - either wet or dry -  does not increase beef's marbling. ever. When you say things like that to folks who know better, you immediately discredit yourself and the restaurant. 

I know, we're tough. But we really want you to succeed. So sit down, taste the food -- benchmark yourself against folks who are serving up dishes that you're serving and be honest about how your stack up."}
{"text":"Such good food!! We made reservations for Fathers Day and they treated us like royalty! We got the private dining room and our own server. The food was amazing and so was the service. I would recommend this place for any of your fine dining desires!! Well done!!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing the food was great the customer service was outstanding, the ambience was great everything about this place was great the steaks were perfect the creamed spinach absolutely divine the lobster roll was very delicious I spent my birthday there and definitely will go back again..."}
{"text":"I was taking my wife on a date and saw that Larsen's grill had some good reviews, so I took her there. 

The atmosphere was great, the serving staff was alright, and we got our food in a timely manner. The food was very good, my wife's pasta was exceptional and my French dip was a delight (the taste of the meat). 

The one thing that really hindered the overall experience was the amount of fat in my French dip. I tried to work through it as best I could because the meat and bun were so exceptionally good but the fat was out of control. Almost every bite I took had at least a quarter size amount of fat. A little fat here and there isn't terrible, but this was a LOT of fat. In the end I couldn't finish my sandwich because it just seemed to get worse. 

I think Larsen's is worthy of a 4 to 4 and a half stars, but this really set it back. A dinner that I can't finish because of quality makes it a struggle to rate higher. I'd go back but I wouldn't get the dip again. 

On another note: why in the world would you not serve the Lobster roll on the dinner menu! They said it was a lunch only item but I would have loved to have tried it; if they would have had it available. Could have been a easy higher rating!!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed after spending over $100 for two people here.  The server was great.  The food had a microwaved taste.  the stuffed cheese bread rolls were very hard and when another set of rolls were brought out they were hard as well.  The server finally admitted the rolls were microwave after he told us the first time they were freshly baked.  the restaurant is very dark inside but the decor is beautiful.  they have a nice outdoor patio that does not allow smoke but yet they charge you $10 a cocktail.  I cant drink with a smoke... This is not California!!!  I wont be visiting this restaurant another time in less some major changes are done"}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch at Larsen's Grill today.  It was wonderful!   Our waiter, Dan, was the best.  He was very funny and he recommended that we get the crab cakes, wedge salad and filet mignon sandwich.  GREAT recommendation and we split all three.  The crab cakes were awesome - the best I've had in a very long time (and I loved the sauce with which they were served).  The salad was a typical wedge, BUT the dressing is made on-site and was excellent.  The sandwich - OH MY GOD.  It was wonderful.  Thinly sliced filet (rare +) with boursin cheese, mushrooms and onions.  Dan brought the onions on the side because he said they could overwhelm the flavor of the sandwich and he was right.  He made it such a great lunch for us and his service - and the food - were fantastic.  I will definitely go back!  Great food and wine menu!"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of McCormick's, Morton's, Lawry's steakhouses, and after tonight (my 1rst experience) at Larsen's Grill I would rather cross town!  

I have enjoyed EVERY SINGLE BITE of food, and I can say in all honesty that I've just eaten God's own creamed spinach. LOL, but seriously!!

Can I mention Jeff Sletten was too kind to me after I had the tiniest of hiccups during my meal!  Starla the server REALLY knows her meat

This place is also beautiful!  I can't say enough good."}
{"text":"We had the Filet Mignon sandwich, Turkey Melt with sweet potato fries and the steak chili as a starter. Our server Micah was wonderful and suggested red onions with the chili. It was a tasty addition.  I believe the sweet potato fries to be the best in town! Everything was so delicious and fresh. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it. I had the \" wet\" filet. You could cut it with a butter knife. We started with crab cake appetizer which was very good. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, made sure we were ok, but didn't hover. I had the loaded potato. By the time I finished, I was too stuffed for dessert. So, one appetizer and two steak dinners $115.00 without tip. Go for a special occasion, unless you can afford it just because!"}
{"text":"We just left an amazing lunch a at Larsen's. We had one tiny problem, but Jeff (the manager) and Asia (our server) did everything they could to make it right, and they sure did make it right. 

The food was amazing. The tomato and burrata salad was the best caperese style salad I have ever had. The cheese was so fresh and the dressing was  better than any other I have had. The ribeye was moist and flavorful. We weren't planning on getting dessert, but couldn't turn it down. The sundae and strawberry shortcake were so good. I don't usually order strawberry shortcake, but I couldn't stop eating it. 

The service was awesome. We really appreciate when problems are addressed without making us feel bad for it. They were so wonderful and fixed everything perfectly. I appreciate good customer service as much as I appreciate a good meal. 

We will definitely be returning to Larsen's Grill....Often!"}
{"text":"The first time we dined here for dinner we noticed that there was quite a crowd in the bar area for Happy Hour. Clearly we were missing a good time. On Veteran's Day we came again for dinner, but when we walked in I remembered the Happy Hour. I was able to talk my husband into giving it a try and I'm glad that I did. For those that are on the fence like my husband was, you can also order a meal in the bar area if someone prefers a meal over Happy Hour. 

Even though we were in the bar area the service didn't suffer a bit. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. He checked on us several times and the food came out quickly. At the end of our meal he even noticed a small pin my husband was wearing and asked if he was a Veteran. My husband said that he was. When we got our check it reflected a Veteran's Day discount. This was really nice because my husband isn't the type to ask for a discount. Thank you for recognizing a special day to us and to many.

From the Happy Hour menu we ordered Prime Rib Sliders, Macaroni and Cheese, Steak Tacos, and Buffalo Chicken Potato Skins. The Prime Rib Sliders were amazing and definitely the best item we had. The meat was tender and just juicy enough. I liked the ciabatta bread that it was served on as well. The sliders came with au jus and horseradish, but they didn't require anything additional. The Macaroni and Cheese was okay, but not the best of the items we ordered. I should mention that it had blue cheese which was fine with me since I love it, but a huge problem to my husband that hates it. The Steak Tacos were a second runner up to the sliders. They were delicious and cooked with well seasoned onion and mushrooms. So good. The Buffalo Chicken skins were good had plenty of chicken and a good amount of cheese without overpowering the other flavors.

The portions were generous for a Happy Hour and very reasonably priced. This is definitely now on our list of regular spots for both dinner and Happy Hour."}
{"text":"A little pricey but super delicious.  We enjoyed the ambiance and drinks were tasty too.  Henderson needs more places like this. We joined them for a Saturday Happy Hour: crab cake, filet mignon tacos and spinach dip."}
{"text":"Much better steak places in town. Last night was horrible service. I get it was vday but made a reservation a week ago, contacted Tuesday by restaurant to confirm reservation only to show up and be told that they were running 20 minutes behind. Once we were finally seated service didn't improve. Waited over twenty minutes just to get water at the table.  Server came out with our appetizer and tried to deliver it to three other tables before they figured out it belonged to ours.  This happened several other times to other people food as the night progressed.  No small plates given with appetizer that was shared. Once steaks were delivered, it was another twenty minutes before server came back to check if the food was good. Waited another half hour for check to be delivered and payment to be taken. So if you expect decent service this isn't the place for you. Overheard a server complaining how busy they were and saying this is why I don't work on the strip. 

As far as food goes. Artichoke dip for an appetizer was average. Nothing special. My medium rare filet was medium well but since it took so long for anyone to check on us didn't send it back. My husband's steak was supposed to be medium and was medium rare. Sides were average. We didn't order dessert. Wine was good. Another table had to send their steak back for being under cooked. 

There are much better places in town for steak that have superb service and food for the same price. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Happy Hour is the Henderson!
Dave / Dan - Can make an mean dirty martini & lemon drop!
Thank You for a amazing time!"}
{"text":"2nd times a charm. 

The management and restaurant team went above and beyond to ensure our experience was flawless. The food was top notch as we'll as the service. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food without having to drive to the strip. The atmosphere is great and the restaurant is very well designed. The menu offers a very diverse selection of food that is prepared to perfection. Give Larsen's a try."}
{"text":"First time diners and super impressed.  Excellent service, super fast and meals were delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a great place for lunch. Our waiter, Dan had recommended that we start off with the crab cakes.  He was right!  The crab cakes were the best we have ever had. I also ordered the wedge salad.  Excellent choice!  It was absolutely delicious. For our entree, we ordered the pan blackened chicken pasta.  It too was outstanding. Our waiter gave us great recommendations and superb service. We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Larsen's a a month ago and I did not have a pleasant experience with the waiter. He came up to my boyfriend and I once and that was it. He greeted us handed us some water and that was the last of it util it was time for the bill to come. No water refills and didn't come by to check on us. One thing that was bothersome was when we paid he left and never came back go give us a receipt. We were sitting waiting for him to come back and we never returned. I said screw it and walked to the front to leave when I saw the waiter chit chatting with some people at the bar. Food was good. Not the best I have had but tasty. Horrible waiter! Unhelpful and careless."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to try this place before we went shopping during the Christmas season. What a great choice! We've visited this establishment twice, and I can't wait to go back. The food is beyond great. No matter what we ordered, even a salad tasted so so good. The drinks, the Cucumber Mule drink was the best drink I've ever tasted. I tried to go other places to get something similar, and there's just no comparison AT ALL! Oh, and the service is the best I've ever received. Micah and the rest of their staff are awesome."}
{"text":"Keep going back, love the consistency in the food and now we usually get served by the female blonde bartender and she is so friendly and professional at the same time.  Def a must in our weekly date nights."}
{"text":"Went here last week.  It was a Friday evening and there was no wait, bonus.   As we walked in I noticed that there was hardly anyone there. That should of been a sign and we should of just left.   I ordered the fish and chips and they were \"Meh\".  The wife ordered the chicken sandwich. Now it was big but she said it was good but the chicken and I quote \"Must have cost them 99 cents.\".  So for fish and chips a chicken sandwhich and one diet coke our bill was 47 bucks....Garbage.   We will not be back and from the looks of things I can see this place being shuttered in less than a year."}
{"text":"There are times in Life when you just have your mind blown away and this was only lunch. Prime Rib Sandwich..BOOM...a must have. AMAZING!!!!  Oh...ask for the creamy freaking awesome Mac and Cheese for the side.  I can only imagine dinner at this place. The dinner menu looked tempting and wine selection WOW. We will be back.  Service Excellent"}
{"text":"I recently ate at Larsen's Grill with a large group. The staff was kind enough to close down the restaurant for lunch just for us. The service was excellent! The food was hot and tasty. There was a set menu but we had great choices. 
The reason I did not give them 5 stars is the seating. Almost 100 people and we were crammed into booths and 4 to a table. It was hard to hear and see our program. I think they could have had different seating (long tables down the middle of the room) and it would have been much more comfortable and afforded us the ability to see and hear the entertainment and meeting speakers. 
The booths are great if you are going with a significant other but for that many women it is too hard to be sociable when you have to get in and out of booths. Most ladies spent time walking around the room to be social which made it harder for the wait staff."}
{"text":"Party of five, and we got the worst server in history.  Got orders wrong,, didn't write anything  down. Manager came over and picked a fight with my husband which was the wrong thing to do. Food was okay. Steaks cooked wrong and one person in our party got the wrong steak.  Ordered bernaise sauce when we placed our order, had to ask 2 times for it and it came when the meal was over.  Just a bad experience!  Suggest a pen and paper for their waiters."}
{"text":"Continue to go as best place for premium steak in southeast Henderson. Been several more times and tried ribeye, sirloin and salmon. All really good. Service is top notch. It should be busier than it is - hope the mall location and casino area doesn't turn people off. It is pricy but on par with Del Frisco, Flemings, etc without the drive."}
{"text":"The only reason that it gets two stars is because they had really nice staff. The food was terrible and overpriced. Creamed spinach had such a strong fish taste I had to send it back. Also spinach dip had a similar fishy taste.  Won't be eating there again

In response to Larsen's review:
There were two orders of creamed spinach, one was to be taken back and credited to my bill.  It was taken back, but never credited. The other order was replaced with mashed potatoes, which honestly were a tad watery and not good either.  
Lastly, when called, it was an inopportune time to talk and I never used the word \"great.\" I stated it was fine. Fine because as stated, the staff was excellent and  Birthday's are always a good time with friends, so yes a good Birthday was had. That doesn't mean the food was good."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally visit Larsen's.  I was not disappointed.  Our waiter Neal was great and the manager Ty was personal and professional.  We received great service.  We love the piano bar and the décor.  The New York steak was delicious and the Tuna tartar appetizer is really big enough to be an entrée.  We look forward to making this a regular place to dine."}
{"text":"I just can say one thing about this place absolutely amazing food so good sorry very very  good!!!!! Plus the service finally good service in Las Vegas thanks mr. Michael Braswell this will be our place for me and my wife can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"The spirit of true hospitality is such an important part of a good dining experience, and Larsen's seems to really understand that. We had heard of this place opening but had no expectations when we decided to check it out on an afternoon trip to the Galleria. After figuring out where to enter (the remodel on the front side of the mall is really nice) we saw that they close between 2:00 & 5:00 PM...and it was literally 1:55. As we walked up an employee was exiting and very cheerfully let us know we had time to be seated and it wouldn't be a problem. Having been in the industry for quite a few years, I was a bit skeptical. It's not cool to come in minutes before closing! But, the hostess had the same cheerful and sincere attitude, assuring us that it would be their pleasure to serve us. Sadly, I don't remember her name, but she was super welcoming. Our server (Shardé!) was also genuinely friendly & cheerful, as well as striking a perfect balance between being attentive and letting us be.

We started with cocktails, and my husband was thrilled with the hand-stuffed blue cheese olives in his martini (we plan to return for happy hour, especially when it cools off a bit; there's a great patio area). As for food, we shared steamed mussels and a lobster roll with grilled asparagus, all beautifully presented and yummy.

Second visit was with some girlfriends for dinner, and again the hospitality vibe was on and the food was quite good. Happy hour apps, we tried the meatballs (meh, but that wasn't my pick, not my favorite thing) and crab cake (delish) then got seated for dinner. I had the Thai Noodle salad, which was really good. It had quite a bit of greens and not so much noodles, which was a positive in my book. I got to taste everyone else's food too: Seared Ahi Tuna Salad, Dry Aged Filet Mignon, and Cedar Plank Salmon, unanimously enjoyed. 

The server was funny and very nice, unfortunately I'm blanking on his name; the only misstep was when one friend ordered a glass of wine (after we has finished a couple bottles, 2 different pinot noirs) he brought a completely wrong wine, a chard.....however, this can't really be counted since she didn't let him know! I'm sure he would have cheerfully taken it back and brought the right one. Life is too short to drink the wrong wine!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for dining alternatives, we finally have a steak place outside of the Casino restaurants that is worthy.  Larsen's is very, very good.

a. Ambiance and Decor is top notch. Great location, parking, nice and attractive entry way!

b. Service - From the reception desk to the host to the server, excellent and first class.

c.  Food - We skipped the appetizers and went right for the meat.

- The Dry Aged Filet was very, very good. I ordered it Blue and while I like it more rare, it came out more medium and it was still tasty. I did not complain at all as it was still tasty.

- The Rib Eye was very tasty and full of flavor from the nice marbled fat that was also aged 28 days.

- Friends had the Filet and the stuffed chicken. They said that the stuffed chicken was the best they had EVER!

d.  Desserts - My ole my. I had the Peanut fudge cake and ate all by myself.  Each of us had a dessert and we were very, very happy.

e.  Good Drinks and good fun.  GK Says check it out."}
{"text":"The filet was the best I've had in a very long time.  Melt in your mouth tender and perfectly seasoned.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for their soft opening. The place is beautiful and it's great to have a non casino steakhouse option in Henderson. We sat at the bar and the owner came by to introduce himself. Everyone was really nice and the service was great. I was also pleasantly surprised to see they have gaming and are non-smoking. Can't wait to come back and try dinner next time!"}
{"text":"flawless. I will definitely be coming back here! I got a medium rare dry aged 8 oz filet with broccoli. the filet was cooked amazingly, tender and seasoned. the broccoli had lots of garlic- delicious. my server starla was a super star. the manager who checked on me was very sweet as well. the decor is high end and gorgeous- very warm ambiance. cannot wait to try out the patio when the weather is nicer. thanks larsens! so happy to have you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a super steak house where you can choose what kind of aging your steak went through. 
 My aged prime filet was tender and flavorful..  Sides are extra and I recommend ordering sides for the table and sharing so that everyone can get a taste of the many splendid sides.  this is like a Ruth's Chris or Morton's as is the pricing for the meal.  This probably should be 4 $$$$.  Not complaining, it's that good and you pay for it."}
{"text":"We love Larsen in Oxnard but we visited LV for a Birthday Celebration  and were happy to know they had a restaurant in near by Henderson . The service from Adam was absolutely top notch . We had the Opolo Zinfandel that was pair perfect with our meal . The setting is very nice and the menu options are great"}
{"text":"Neil is the best server! He recommend the best desert and wine for my grandma and helped us with any questions that we had"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place.

Decided to try their happy hour and glad I did. It was a warmer night so we chose the patio. They had pit fires going and lit one of the space heaters. A great atmosphere for a romantic meal.

They have  a good variety of options for food and drink on the happy hour menu. We chose crab cake, prime rib sliders, steak tacos and two salads. The meat was the star for sure. The sliders were so tender and they used just the right bread for dipping in the sauce. Everything was fresh and perfect for sharing. Added a couple of glasses of house wine and this was all a very satisfying meal for a good price.

Props to our server who was super friendly and had great suggestions. I look forward to trying a full steak dinner there soon."}
{"text":"If Yelp had 6 stars, I'd give them 6.  I come to town from Los Angeles quite often to do business in Henderson.  Normally I'd have to go way South to dine, as I'm a bit of a food snob.  I've been to Larsen's a few times now and have to say, it's FANTASTIC.  Impeccable service and incredibly prepared food.   The steaks are top quality.  Boy do they make a great martini.

Their patio looks south over the new fountain and patio areas and because it is elevated, it has fantastic views of the valley to the South.  The sound of the waterfall adds to the ambiance.   

It may seem this place isn't open, as there are additional restaurants around it getting ready to open.  LARSEN'S GRILL IS A MUST for all those in Henderson.  So nice to see this shopping center stepping it up."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, casual yet classic. Food was great I had the filet well done and it was cooked. Also had baked potato and maple glazed carrots both very good. My friend had the crunchy lobster roll and said it was good. For the price you can't beat the service and the food."}
{"text":"We just had the best dinner; I can't decide which my favorite was.  Tried the dry rub Rib eye, Pork Chop, Prime Rib dip sandwich, and key lime pie, Dutch apple pie and Crème Brule.  Everything was fabulous, the sweet potato waffle fries where outstanding and the key lime pie was one of the best we ever had.
The service was just wonderful, we will be going back and the prices were not that bad for a steak house."}
{"text":"Neil was our server, and he was awesome. He checked in on us enough to be polite and provide excellent service, but not so often as to interrupt or be overbearing. His wine recommendation was on point, and he was pleasantly fun. The food was delicious, as always. It was a very nice experience!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner last night and was throughly disappointed. I started with the Ceasar salad and the Parmagian shavings on top had no taste and was as hard as plastic. The roll served with it could have been used for a bouncy ball. The porterhouse steak was served well done, while I had asked for medium well, pink inside. The perppercorn sauce which they charged $2 for, was salty and not edible. The only good thing was the martini and the nice bartender. I will never go back. I certainly will never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my first visit for lunch and can't wait for a dinner occasion. They off organic grass fed steaks as well. The waiter and manager are wonderful. They accommodated me on a drink order that they don't have on the menu. I can not rave enough about this wonderful place. Don't come half hungry by the time you leave you will be stuffed!"}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant. I've NEVER had a better steak in Vegas!  This newly opened restaurant won't be a \"best kept secret\" once they have the grand opening. OMG!  Beautifully decorated, amazing service AND the BEST food in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great and a must try !! Food and service was amazing !  Great food variety even for non meat eaters. There is sushi salads steaks and tons more!!  Beautiful inside and out...love  the decor and  bar area is big and gorgeous & outside seating is very nicely done ."}
{"text":"I came here to have dinner from a busy day at work, the only reason this restaurant caught my interest was due to its mention in a magazine I read while flying. The article mentioned this as one of the best dining experiences in Henderson and even gave an order suggestion. I'm by nature a foodie, due to having traveled and dined at many unique restaurants in the states, so my only explanation for the article was that the author was possibly comparing this to typical steak house dining in a typical suburb. I ordered the authors recommendation and was not at all impressed. Both the appetizer and entree were very bland and flavorless, I only ate it because I was starving and it was edible.  When the server brought out the main entree the sea bass fell over the hard pile of rice that it was served on and she placed the plate down on the table with it already looking like a tumbled mess. The taste, presentation, and menu selections are very bland, save your money. If you're going for happy hour only, they do have a decent bar. I will scout a smaller non-chain restaurant next time instead."}
{"text":"First visit here and will definitely return!  Excellent food, service and ambiance.  The crab cakes were the best I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Went to larsens for new years dinner and as always food was great , wish I could say the same thing for the service, the waiter Jeremy we had would disappear for long periods of time , water glasses empty , wine glasses empty, when ordered some extra bread took at least 20 min. To get to us , by the time got to us already finished my meal, was not very attentive, still love the food , but when you pay this kind of money for a dinner you expect excellent service."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Wait staff is very attentive. Only problem was the lady helping the wait staff was a little too quick grabbing plates off the table without bothering to ask if we were done eating. As I was taking a drink she grabbed my plate while I was still eating. PLEASE ASK FIRST!"}
{"text":"Larsen's is a nice addition to the Galleria Mall that gives us an option for an upscale steakhouse without having to leave Henderson. We came here for my wife's birthday on a Wednesday which just happened to be Wine Wednesday at Larsen's where any bottle of wine under $100 was half price. This allowed us to get two bottles for our meal and made the celebration that much more enjoyable.

Park on either level of parking on the south side of the mall and you can get to the restaurant through its outdoor entrance in just a short walk. Using OpenTable, we made reservation for 9 at 7:15 and our table was ready as soon as we arrived. We were seated at a long table in the middle of the restaurant. The space was open with high ceilings, many wooden beams, and windows that were floor to ceiling that allowed plenty of light to come in and gives a full view of the outdoors.

Michael served us and did an excellent job giving us an overview of the restaurant, the specials for the day, and recommendations for the discounted wine. The foundation of Larson's menu is their steaks. They serve both select and prime cuts which are aged wet and dry respectively. Bonuses to the menu are the steaks are served with one side and there is also a sushi roll section.

Two appetizers, nine entrees, and four desserts were ordered (see pictures). For entree, I had the 10 oz, grass fed, dry aged, prime filet with the creamed spinach. I requested the filet cooked rare and Michael was considerate enough to ask if I wanted the cut to be seared and I'm happy I did get it seared because it allowed me to taste all the seasonings. The marbled steak was delicious and cooked perfectly. The creamed spinach was one of the best sides I've had this year. The butter cake was the best dessert and highly recommended.

The price for the meal before tip was just over $400 which makes the $$$ price point just about right. Some little things kept the meal from being perfect such as we had to top our wine glasses ourselves, the bus person didn't take the silverware also when removing the plates after each course (luckily, Michael replaced all silverware before each course arrived), and all of the entrees were brought out in stages with the the birthday girl's food coming a good 7-8 minutes after everyone else's food arrived.

None of these things will keep us from coming back and I'm looking forward to the next visit when I'm in the mood for a juicy steak."}
{"text":"I loved this place, great drinks and appetizers for happy hour. Huge outdoor seating area. My server was this cute little hipster chick, and each table had their own fire pit. Only draw back was its location overlooking the mall parking lot, but you can still see plenty of sky for sunsets. ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and decadent!! The 5 times I've visited here with the family, it's always been a pleasure. Food is tasty and hot, service is 5 star, atmosphere is beautiful. You won't be disappointed. Dive in!!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing \"steakhouse\" I've ever been to. 

How do you make filet mignon dry? Especially one that costs $52? 

I had to wait to send my steak back, because it came out borderline well when I asked for medium (even the outside was burned) because the waiter was MIA. The manager was nice enough to bring me the second steak and apologize, but by that point we'd already been there close to an hour and I could no longer wait to eat, otherwise I would have sent back the second one as well. (Was barely medium). 

I actually had to choke it down it was so dry. 

Manager offers a free dessert- and a random dessert just shows up as a \"sorry\" without a choice. Didn't have room after scarfing my food. 

Didn't bother to offer us any discount on a $200 bill, as if a dessert that wasn't eaten made up for it. 

I won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and great food for any person, any budget! Larsen's Grill has been a great asset to Henderson Locals! Can't say enough about the ambiance and the quality of food throughout the entire restaurant. Great for happy hour, lunch, or fine dining. Larsen's can be casual or formal and everything in between. 

Started with the Filet Mignon Sashimi appetizer and it was fantastic, a must have for starters.
Steak, chicken, pork chop...tried it all and can't be any more excited for great quality food. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my recent trip here very much. It is a $$$$ kind of restaurant, but nice jeans are acceptable. We started out with a crunchy lobster roll, and it was ok. Had way too much of a rice wrap than it should and much less of the inside ingredients, which was a let down. I would not get again. The star if the show here was the 16oz dry aged rub rib eye. It was truly amazing,and probably the best steak I have ever tasted.  $55, with one side included. My wife ordered that and I had the sea bass $38 white sticky rice and asparagus included. It was also very delicious, and well cooked. We had the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert which was still partially frozen, and nothing special. Our waiter Neal was excellent. The only thing I would mention was he listed all the specials and their preparation off so fast, they all ran together and out of probably 6 or so I only remembered two. He sounded like that Fed Ex guy on the commercial. We went early and there were only a few tables on this Sat night. We will definitely be back because the entrées were exceptional."}
{"text":"I'm glad my hisband and I came here. The food and service was great. Portions are a good size and the food is good. Neil was our server and was great. He kept coming by to make sure we were ok and I'll just say I never had to ask to have my drink reflled. So don't believe the lady in the previous review. If you want a nice meal with a nice ambiance then this is your place. Thank you Larsen's staff for your impeccable service."}
{"text":"If you want to pay a huge amount of money for a meal that is only slightly better than casino food look no further. You found it when you pay the upwards of $50 a plate and your meal comes with a single side and no salad, you expect it's gonna rock your socks off. Nope it subpar at best prime rib was fatty and gristly and had no flavor honestly I eat at local casinos all over Henderson and for less than $10 I get much better prime rib and several sides. Don't waste your money here that's just one guys opinion.  Thy did give us a nice dessert because we were celebrating our 22 wedding anniversary."}
{"text":"Fantastic service 
And best food in town. steaks salmon and salads ALL FANTASTIC. And the creme brûlée is sooooo good too.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta say this place is on point with food, service, and portions. If you go during happy hour you can affordably try allot of great menu items!  The wedge salad is amazing and the steak tacos, yummy!  Jake the bartender remembers us every time we go."}
{"text":"I came here for Thanksgiving Dinner at 5:30pm, and also to watch the Packers/Bears game as I don't get NBC on my OTA antenna (still working on this). Shockingly as I walked up I saw people going inside, but when I walked inside, the bar area was completely empty. There were about 6 dinner tables occupied though. So I had the bar to myself, and the lovely Briana as my bartender. She's a cool person, and knows a lot about craft beers because her hubby runs Sin City Brewing Tours. So we had some good conversation.

They specialize in steak, but I went with the traditional Thanksgiving dinner which included turkey in gravy, cherry sauced ham, stuffing, whipped sweet potatoes, veggies, and cranberry sauce for $35. Includes a choice of dessert as well. Food was pretty good, but nothing that said wow, but that's ok because I've eaten Thanksgiving dinners in a lot of nice restaurants and they don't really prep to show off the chef's skills, they just provide a nice meal.

I'll be back to try out the HH as they have some good selections. And to try a steak. Prices were a bit high but comparable to nice Strip steakhouses. Decor is very upscale even though its located in the Galleria Mall. 

Be aware of the fire alarm!!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem in Henderson. I had the dry-aged ribeye with a side of Brussels sprouts. The steak, which had so much marbling it was bordering luxurious and gluttonous, was awesome and cooked perfectly well. The sprouts we're flash fried and lightly salted, just the way I like them. 

If you're on a ketogenic diet like I am, I highly highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with my first visit to this establishment.  Giant Bacon Wrapped Shrimp made for a nice juicy start, followed by a very tasty Caesar Salad with large elongated anchovies.  But, as most diners would probably prefer, the highlight of the meal was the entree of Surf & Turf.  Here I was presented with a buttery 8 oz. medium-rare Prime Filet and a 7-8 oz Lobster Tail that was noticeably sweet.  This hot land & sea duo, augmented by delectable mushrooms and drinkable Bearnaise Sauce, along with fine House Cut Fries that were soft on the inside and a little crisp on the inside, was clearly a match to what is served up at the best high-end steak houses on the outside.

For dessert a Hot Fudge Sundae had a surprise Brownie on the bottom!  The setting was fireplace casual but with a sense of refinement.  Table service was very good.  And other restaurant staff members were very hospitable too--from initially accepting a reservation by phone, through greeting my party of four upon arrival, seating us with a smile, and bidding us a cheerful farewell upon our departure.

I only wished I had ordered a second Lobster Tail instead of splitting one with Diane.  Next time I surely will!"}
{"text":"OMG I absolutely love this place!! The staff and service are always on point, and the food is AMAZING!! The Filet Mignon sliders are to die for!! And I'm obsessed with their old fashions yum!!! I highly recommend this place for a perfect date night or small intimate gathering:) thank you!!"}
{"text":"After many years of cooking Thanksgiving dinner at home we decided to go out to eat this year. Larsens was open at 3:00 pm so we made reservations for an early dinner. We were greeted as we walked in by the two very nice hostesses and sat at a booth. The restaurant was pretty dead, just a couple other tables occupied. 

I really like the decor and ambiance at Larsen's. It is decorated with lots of wood and stone and dark colors. They also have a beautiful bar with all the liquor bottles color coordinated. Our server Michael arrived to explain the Thanksgiving dinner special as well as the other menu items. Michael provided us with outstanding service throughout the dinner, a really top notch server. The Thanksgiving dinner special was either Ham or Turkey that came with mashed sweet potatoes, stuffing, vegetables and cranberry sauce. It also included a dessert for only $34.95. It sounded like a great deal, however the actual portions of turkey and ham were very small,

We started off with a ceasar and a chopped salad, both split which was no problem at all. The split size was actually plenty and the salads were both very good. We all opted for the Thanksgiving special. When it arrived I was pretty surprised at how small the portions were, hence the $34.95 price. It was one small dry slice of ham and one small slice of Turkey that was actually pretty good. The mashed sweet potatoes were luke warm as were the vegetables and meat. The stuffing arrived shortly after the dinners and it was really good and served hot. 

For dessert three of us had the pecan pie and my mom had apple pie ala mode. The pie pieces were very big, presented beautifully and most importantly were delicious. Michael continued to check on us and make sure our glasses were always full. Overall it was a really nice meal, especially since I didn't have to cook it or clean up! I will be returning to Larsen's to try out their steaks very soon."}
{"text":"There is something to be said about stumbling upon a gem like this. From the moment we walked in, the place wasn't busy, hardly anyone there but, we were still greeted with warm
Smiles and attended to immediately. Everything my guest and I had was 100% on point! As my friend already wrote a review on what we tried there, I won't repeat what he said but, I will say that this place is a must try! I can guarantee you will not be disappointed. As a member of the service industry myself, I am Extremely picky ... but, the bar was extremely clean and well maintained, Dan our bartender / server was attentive, explained things on the menu , even gave us some of his recommendations which we tried! Even though we live on the other side of town, we are planning on coming back and trying other things on the menu. I glanced at their happy hour menu which I'm
Excited to try! Also, their deserts were delicious! Kudos to the owners who we had the pleasure to meet during our dining experience!"}
{"text":"For a Friday night it was easy to make a reservation via Open Table . Walked in and seated right away . Server brought over water . Waiter came over to tell us about drink specials but didn't take order came back and my husband asked for wine to which the waiter replied with a beer to confirm . Had to continuously look for him to order . Ordered appetizers and the tuna was mediocre but lobster roll was great . Husband had a steak and I ordered a burrata salad . Which for some reason since I thought it was a salad would come on micro greens or some type of greens .  My husbands $54 steak was more like the sizzler daily special . Would have much rather went to Delfriscos . The butter cake was overdone and dry .
Being that it wasn't that busy they didn't seem to have enough staff or maybe they did and they just were not attentive .  So save your money and your appetite and drive the extra 15 minutes to Delfriscos or Mortons ."}
{"text":"Ran into this restaurant. So glad we did. Started with the Lobster Roll, which seemed a bit pricy; however, when the roll was served, it was very large. I had the chopped salad, which could have had a little fresher greens. Some pieces had brown edges. Not what I would expect at this caliber restaurant.  We split the tritip mushroom soup. It was delicious.  My husband had the Cobb Salad, which was very large. 
The restaurant is beautiful. The service very professional and attentive. There is a nice private dining room for small groups. 
I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Must get the Chilean Sea Bass! Best in town. Thanks for the recommendation from Neil our server tonight. Simply delicious piece of fish over wild rice. Sumptuous"}
