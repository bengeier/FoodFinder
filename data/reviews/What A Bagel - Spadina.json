{"text":"It was ok. Prices were high for OK food. I had the vegetarian bagel, and it was a little bland. The coffee was good though. Pastries looked amazing but I never got around to trying one, though my best friend, a local, said they were amazing. Service was mediocre. If you can try someplace else, try it, if not...then don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Went on my birthday earlier this month, showed my ID and they give you a DOZEN free bagels. Your choice of flavours (with the exception of the twister and flat bagels). They even gave me a freezer bag so I could make sure they don't spoil at home. I'm still working on them and have enjoyed some delicious smoked salmon sandwiches this month :)"}
{"text":"Wish there was a bonus star I could give!! We went to Toronto for the weekend and absolutely LOVED What a Bagel!!! We had a huge group of 10 and asked for a table outside and they were great, they took us outside and rearranged tables so we could all sit together. Also, my cousin has a gluten intolerance and the staff there was excellent about it! In addition there was a lot of choice on the food, the food was fantastic, and the owner and his staff were so nice! We went back the next morning and the owner remembered us and talked to us like old friends! Great time, we will definitely be back and recommend to anyone in Toronto to go there!"}
{"text":"Came in with my wife and kids. 
The place was packed inside and outside. 
We Asked them to sit by the patio as weather was perfect. Only took  10 minutes and we got out sits. 
I have to say that this place is much better than any other what A bagel locations we dined. 
This one is cool. Great staff(friendly and fast), nice music in the background but the best part is the food. 
The menu had lots a different options to choose from. We all ordered different dishes and the food was delicious!!!
Definitely recommend the shakshuka omelet with the israeli salad and the salami toast. 
Bill came very reasonable. 
We are coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Our server was Daniel, we've received excellent service. The breakfast was amazing! we were traveling with children and our daughter dropped her utensils 3 times, yes... One server quickly picked it up and another server gave her a new utensils as a team. It's great when you see great team work, service and the food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've only ever been in here to pick up a quick pastry and a drink to go. Especially for the area, it's great for that - I lived in Montreal for four years, and I miss having a decent pain au chocolat or a filouze to grab and go.

Short version: if you're in the area, stop in for a quick bite. I haven't tried any of their sit-down plates though, so can't speak for that."}
{"text":"Said they deliver on both yelp and justeat but when I call in they said they don't do delivery... what the heck?"}
{"text":"I have left this review for a while. This location touts a big Gluten-free banner in the window - but there is no education or awareness about being gluten-intolerant or celiac. Initially, some the staff were good with being gluten-free aware with the bagels (new glove, knife, wiping down the toaster if you asked) - mainly you had to ask a few times. The gluten-free bagels are from frozen. They are outsourced and are actually not bad (for gluten-free). 

My frustration is staff not being diligent in cross-contamination and being rude about it. One older lady wouldn't change gloves, she gets mad if you ask to clear the restaurant grade toaster filled with crumbs (before you get mad, not talking about a whole process, just one quick swipe, so your bagel doesn't land in a sea of crumbs). Another younger woman just refused to deal, so I walked out - she was busy finishing a catering job before the end of the day, and was more interested in that, than someone who was politely asking to wear a glove to decrease cross-contamination. 

I talk about cross-contamination as I got quite sick from a breakfast bagel made in the back. Even though someone told me they have a separate toaster in the back (later told another time, they don't). 

I think if you're going to advertise Gluten-free food (quite loudly), please train and educate your staff to learn how to work with it. I think it would take 3 min. in staff training to say - hey, we have gluten free bagels (and charge a premium for them), please use a new glove, wax paper, new knife and wipe down the toaster. Please be considerate as they are people who can get really sick. By the way - I know you can't cut all cross contamination and are not liable for it. I know this place is filled with gluten. I'm not asking for a full gold treatment. Maybe it would take 20 sec, more - not even. But a few small measures would make it go down so much easier. I don't want to target certain workers (I only assume from other reviews that they are not paid well or potentially not treated well or not trained or educated about gluten intolerance - I get it, it's a hard job), but some down right get annoyed or don't do it when you ask. Also, given the advertisement, why not add a $20 gluten-free only toaster in the front? I see this as a management problem - in training. Several negative reviews - with the manager responding, but same issues keep coming up??

By the way, a couple of times when I did get it done properly, the gluten free bagels are not bad, and I like the cream cheese here. They also have some healthy smoothies and salads. I like the coffee and a few people have been nice about it way back when....it's the handling of the food, and sometimes bad attitude for someone with dietary restrictions (to a place that promotes it)."}
{"text":"I go here almost daily for a coffee, bagel or rugalach. The staff are friendly and always have a smile on their faces. Sometimes I sit down for lunch and the waiter always remembers my favourite order. I love that they've brought Jewish baking downtown as now I'm able to get my challah for shabbat as well as sufganiyot on Channukah. The food is fresh, delicious and if you have an issue they're always happy to fix it."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a warm day brunch. The patio is nice, you can get to sit in the sun or hide under the umbrella, the food is fresh. There are fresh citrus juices, and everything tastes great. It's on a pricy side and during peak hours the service could be VERY slow. On one of the occasions we were waiting close to an hour for our food, and the owner or manager personally walked up to us and offered apologies, which was rather nice. They do seem to be understaffed for those hours when everyone is trying to get their weekend brunch."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were frequent brunch customers for almost a year, largely because the food and prices weren't half bad. But, one of the last times we ate there I ordered my regular brunch order, their version of Eggs Benedict, and either because of an excess of lemon or an expired ingredient, the hollandaise sauce was really off. So I called a guy who I assume was the manager of the place over to tell him there is something wrong with the food. After telling him he responds that \"that's impossible.\" So, I make him try it to demonstrate the problem and he tells me that its fine, I'm wrong and in fact that is how it should taste. After a couple more minutes of poor customer relations he finally gives in and asks if I'd like to order sometime else and says he'll take the Benedict off the bill.

When out waitress came over to take my new order I make her try it and an unhappy pucker appears on her face. She than tells us that she has the Benedict when she arrived before she started work and that the hollandaise on my order was totally different from hers and there was obviously something wrong with it. When she brought out my new order she reveals that the kitchen admitted there was way to much lemon in the batch of hollandaise sauce that went on my plate.

The manager (or whatever he was) never offered an apology."}
{"text":"Bagels are good, but when staff is unnecessarily rude, it's hard to enjoy the bagel. Went in today for a bagel with lettuce, turkey and cream cheese. She put about 2 teaspoons of cream cheese (an additional $1), and when I asked for more, she said that it would be $1 more and said it in the most rude way and muttered something under her breath to a coworker and chuckled! Yes, I realize it's only a dollar, actually $2 extra dollars, but when you're already paying $8.00 for a bagel, I really don't think it's necessary.

This has actually happened to me 3x and each time I say I won't go back, however, this really is the last time I enter this establishment. Never again!! 

There seems to be a problem in this city with some establishments believing we (the consumers) owe them something and that we should take what we get, I don't think so! Remember that if we (your customers) don't buy things, you will be out of business! I work hard for my money and expect to be treated with respect and courtesy- I don't think this is too much to ask."}
{"text":"I hate coming here. Lunch time is the worst, the second you come in your not really sure where to go to place an order. There's one line for custom sandwiches, but then if your ordering one of their signature sandwiches thst line doesn't really apply since they won't make it while you wait in that line. They really need clear signage of which line you need to be to order which type of sandwich. 

Last time I ordered, my fries were rock hard and it was before the lunch rush. The food is inconsistent, sometimes its, sometimes its not. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"I went with my family and we thought the food was perfect, the location was ideal, and the staff was friendly.  My husband ordered an omelet (and a bagel -- all was delicious, and he made a valiant effort to eat it all); I had a pumpernickel bagel with the chive cream cheese, tomato, capers and smoked salmon (perfectly prepared, no surprises, fruit on the side was a generous serving and all the cuts were fresh); my four-year-old had a rainbow bagel with rainbow cream cheese (which I was as excited to see as he was); and we let our seven-year-old order the oreo nutella waffles (thank goodness he was full after ten bites).  We enjoyed a table on the patio.  Even though the cafe was busy, our server took great care of us."}
{"text":"Really good gluten free bagels- which is seriously tricky to find! Plus the coffee is great!"}
{"text":"I really love their chocolate croissant, chicken salad bagel and challah sesame seeds bread. I was surprise that all their customers including me got 6 fresh bagels for free on their customer appreciation day."}
{"text":"The other posters have said that the pricing needs to be adjusted and they are spot on. A single large bagel?  $0.95.   Cream cheese on it?  Now it's $5!!!!  WTF?   A decent bagel with cream cheese (which is all this is) is pretty basic and can be found all over the city for much less. I'm never coming back here...I don't mind profit or paying a premium for outstanding food, but I resent getting blatantly RIPPED OFF."}
{"text":"Fresh and hot and delicious bagels, plus all sorts of baked goodies.  
Worth your time to stop here and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"It was a rather mixed experience.

The food was good. I had the vegetarian breakfast bagel. It tasted good, was pretty filling and only cost $5. On the other hand, the freshly squeezed juice was a rip-off ($4 and it a gross disgusting).

What really threw me off was the service. I found the server abrupt and rude. I understand that they are busy in the morning but that doesn't mean that common courtesy needs to be forgotten. The only upside is that the food came fast (less than 5 minutes).

I might try it again, however at another location."}
{"text":"I used Ritual there for the first time and even though they have an express Ritual line, no one even notices if you're standing there if it's busy and you need to interject yourself into the regular line. It's also awkward because their Ritual line is right where servers need to pass so you're blocking their way. They then gave me my order and when I got home I realized they'd forgotten my smoothie. Even though it's paid for the restaurant doesn't put smoothies onto their receipt. I called them and they asked me to come back and get it since they can't issue a refund.  When I did go back it was all I could do to grab someone to get me the smoothie. Even then she kept asking me which smoothie it was, although I told her I had just called, and I had to look up the name of it on the app.  She was completely unapologetic about them forgetting my smoothie and making me come all the way back.  In fact, she was kind of smirking at my frustration. By the time I got back home my food was cold. This was NOT a good experience."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointing dining experience. I ordered the cobb salad and was brutally disappointed. If you are going to charge $13 and up for a salad- fresh ingredients are a must. Also, with classics like a cobb or caeser,  stick with flavours that go together. A lemon vinaigrette with blue cheese is not pleasing to the palette at all. If you are going to have restaurant prices, then I think it is only fair that the quality match. I actually lost my appetite from this meal. I will never go back to this place. The service was okay, and the place was clean, but it lacked any kind of ambiance. If you are looking for a place for brunch or a late lunch and you live in the neighborhood, I would skip this place altogether."}
{"text":"I had my meal delivered through Ubereats, I had put 2 special instructions both of which What A Bagel fulfilled without extra charge AND sent a free cookie!!! The food was excellent and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Personally did not dine in, because we were just looking to eat before and after we toured parts of Toronto. 

But glad we stopped by What A Bagel! They have a wonderful bagel selection that cannot be beat(wheat, everything, cheese, flaxseed, pumpernickel, you name it!). The store's motto is \"Always Fresh Always Hot\". Perhaps \"always hot\" is a bit misleading but definitely always fresh!"}
{"text":"I must say I'm surprised with all of the negative reviews about service for What A Bagel - 130 Spadina. One of the main reasons I'm even leaving a review was because of their excellent service!
We were visiting Toronto walking around looking for a breakfast stop - we were nearby and Google Maps brought us here.
When we first walked in we were definitely excited. The place is clean and styled perfectly; the food looked amazing and the staff welcomed us in.
The menu was not too big or small. Just enough to choose from. Being I. Toronto I wasn't expecting a $3.99 breakfast - the prices were very reasonable considering the portion sizes - not to mention the quality of the food!
We ordered the Boost omelette and the Vegetarian bagel sandwich. If you like spice - it's a must to pay the $0.50 for their in house hot sauce! The owner/manager was even kind enough to sell us some to take home with us! Very tasty!

Anyways, to discredit the negative reviews, we were very pleased with the service, staff, cleanliness and welcoming atmosphere! A must go if you haven't yet and a must return for us when we're back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is such a horrible location...lacks good consumer service; the price is so high for the amount of food you are getting. I guess I should trusted the negative reviews this joint has. It seems like the owners/managers don't want to rectify the same issues that most people complain about in their reviews. Read the reviews before you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here many times. Yesterday we went for lunch and split a sandwich and the Asian chicken salad which we have ordered before. When we got the salad it was different than before - all lettuce with very little of the other components. I nicely and calmly explained this to our waitress who was awesome - she was super responsive and said she would get it topped off with some of the other ingredients. A minute later the owner came out and in aggressive tone stated the only thing missing from the salad was there was no Napa cabbage because they had run out that morning. No apology. He just kept repeating that was the only thing missing in an accusatory tone like we were in the wrong for pointing out that something was off about the salad. He clearly didn't seem to think topping off our salad was the right approach and wanted us to take it as it was served or order something else. It was such an odd experience. Shouldn't the owner be modeling customer service for his staff??"}
{"text":"Bagel's are good however unfortunately the Bagel lady lacks customer service. Asked for a few more than 2 small slices of pickles and she refused, when I asked again she charged me a $1 for 4 more slices of pickles. Unreal. She needs to go."}
{"text":"I went to What A Bagel today for brunch. This is a great place for that \"classic\" breakfast. I got the 2 eggs and turkey bacon breakfast with homefries. It was a good sized portion for the price I paid. There are also many options in the menu which is great for large groups. 

My friend ordered the On the Go smoothie which consisted of peanut butter, espresso, banana, mint and chocolate protein powder. She ordered it without the mint though. It tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup coffee flavoured smoothie. I definitely recommend it to anyone. It tasted amazing. 

The patio is also great in the summer. 

This place is a great crowd pleaser especially if you are bringing people that are coming from out of town."}
{"text":"Ok this place seems great but it's run by a bunch of very confused restaurant people.  Totally confusing way to order.  Horrible service because nobody knows where to order or pay.  Get it together!  Needs a total re-organization.  One person making the bagel sandwiches?  Totally weird."}
{"text":"You can obviously tell that the staff here hate their jobs. You get sassy attitude thrown at you as soon as you arrive. The seemingly simply task of getting a salad turns into a game of 1912 questions, end result = super fail. The prices are pretty high for the chintzy amounts of flavour they add in. 

Overall vibes: No bueno, go to L-eat around the corner for similar eats and better prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, very fresh & something for everyone on the menu!  Great city patio too."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, but more importantly the service is friendly and attentive. Very easy to eat here and accomodate food restrictions, be it allergies or diet related.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A beautiful Sunday morning, weather is like summer already and for Canadians, we have been waiting for this weather for months. So of course, today, all the patio seats were packed!! I've passed by this place numerous time but finally decide to try it out. The place have both a take-out and dine-in. There was lots of people standing around waiting for take-out. We didn't have to wait long to grab a table. But then, that's when the waiting begins. There was lots of staff running around, but no one seems to see us sitting here .. we finally track down a person but because she doesn't take orders, she had to go find another person. Finally, probably about 10 minutes in, someone took our order. Waiting for the food was again another long one. We didn't get complicated food, just eggs and bagels but it took over 30 minutes before the food arrived.

The manager was around later on and probably that made the food order came faster, if not him directing the staff, maybe our food might take even longer. At least he told them to pour us more coffee while we wait. Finally, after starving for awhile, the food came. I had the BLT breakfast on sesame bagel - scrambled eggs, cheddar, turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato, sundried tomato pesto mayo, and the sweet potato fries. The fries was freshly made, still hot off the stove. Very tasty, no ketchup needed. The bagel was good, thick layer of scrambled egg (but it was a little over cooked), turkey bacon (a lot healthier). My friend had the eggs benedict and the egg was poached perfectly soft on top of fresh English muffin.

The food was good but the wait for the food was very long. Might consider just doing take out next time if I come back."}
{"text":"Bagels - the bagels themselves are great. Only a bit pricey if you get them by themselves, still reasonable if just toasted with butter ($1.65, I think), but get cream cheese or anything else on it...hold onto your wallet. 

Baked goods - really yummy baked goods, but again, hang onto your wallet.

Coffee - passable/acceptable.

Prices - as observed by others, way too high. 

Service - If you thought the staff was just slow, disorganized and flustered because it was just opening jitters, I have news for you: it's not much better now. 

In all fairness, I've found the people doing the coffee and cash register friendly and efficient enough. Ordering from the counter help, however, is a hair-pulling experience more often than not. 

Just this morning, I ordered a bagel with chives cream cheese. After fixing my coffee and waiting 5 minutes, I finally walk over to the counter where the lady tells me she forgot what kind of cream cheese I wanted. So my toasted bagel has been sitting there cooling the whole time? She couldn't have just walked over and asked? Then I watched her take another 2 minutes spreading on the cream cheese because she kept getting sidetracked talking to someone else behind the counter. 

This review would have been 5-stars based on the food alone, knocked down to 4-stars due to price, but the service brings it down to 2-stars. Really, really not impressed by the counter help prepping the food."}
{"text":"The food is good; the pricing is way off of market. The value isn't there for what you're paying. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food and makes amazing fresh bagels!  However the Spadina location, which is close to my work, has a very unfriendly front counter cashier who I have never seen smile or greet me.  I've worked in the customer service industry for years and I know how shitty customers can be and it ruins your whole day when you have a rude customer, I just hope she can learn to forget the bad ones and serve the nice ones a little friendlier."}
{"text":"I always stop by here when I go downtown to stock up on bagels. I usually go for the sesame and everything bagels. The cheese bagels are also delicious, but I've only seen them once so far. I think they only make cheese bagels once a day. The bagels are always very fresh and the texture is perfect. Always a long line up for breakfast/brunch, but never tried out myself."}
{"text":"Service is fast and prices are very reasonable. My favourite is the Jerusalem chicken sandwich with goat cheese and sweet potato fries. They have great smoothies as well as amazing baked goods like almond croissants. Boaz always takes great care of us and is always one of the reasons we head to what a bagel for lunch."}
{"text":"Want a quick breakfast, lunch or yummy bagels - this is your place!  Initially, I thought they only sold bagels but they have a full menu for breakfast and lunch.  Service is quick and meals are quite filling.

Get there early on a weekday if you want a table.  You will often see people meeting up for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch with my hubby and we liked sitting outside on the patio that they took care of covering from the sun in this 38°C hot summer day! It's cool because you can still order breakfast for lunch if you feel like it! I had a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel and my hubby had the BLT sandwich with fries. It was good and the salmon portion was very generous! I usually have never enough because I really love that, but hubby finished my plate given the mountain of salmon they gave me! I really cannot complain about the food! 
Service, on another hand, was a bit below average as I had to ask 4 times for water and the waitress seemed to always forget. In this very hot day, I understand we might be less patient to get served water, but I'm fairly certain that this simple task could be done under 15 minutes!

UPDATE! Tried to give them a second chance today and the lady was extremely rude AGAIN!
We tried sitting on the patio in the shade (as I'm pregnant and burn in seconds!) and she ordered us to sit on a table in the sun because those 4 tables were apparently taken. We thought it was weird at 11am on a Monday lunch. We would have stayed like 20-30 mins for a quick lunch. 
In fact, we past in front of What a Bagel half an hour later after we had lunch somewhere else that did not treat us like we were not welcome and there was still NOBODY sitting at those precious reserved tables!!! I'm glad we spent $70 on a half hour Monday lunch somewhere else and not at What a Bagel!

Now we're never stepping foot in this careless and rude atrocious service restaurant! Even if it's across the street from work! I'm also making sure to spread the word to my coworkers!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great patio and fast service. Quinoa salad is a must try if you have never gotten it."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm pretty upset I haven't tried this place before! The Salads are so flavorful, and the chicken is cooked perfectly! Portions are very gracious and prices are good for portion size."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this bagel shop when I was at the Spadina area killing time before my interview. I didn't eat breakfast yet so I decided to try this place out of curiosity. It was funny walking into the shop all suited up because it has a hipster type of vibe going on (lol).

I decided to order the Jerusalem Toasted Chicken since I was craving chicken at the time. It was delicious! The sesame buns were perfectly toasted with a soft, crunchy exterior. Green olives, mozzarella, tomato salsa, and feta cheese were added to give the sandwich a more flavourful taste.

My assumption is that the rest of the food is good too but I can't be sure until I come back here and try other things on the menu. Customer service is pretty bad; the manager needs to re-train the employees. I ordered my sandwich to-go and waited 15+ minutes! I was almost late for my interview.  

The two reasons I mentioned above is why I took away 2 stars from this review."}
{"text":"How do you do start your breakfast? FRESH! .

@whatabagel making the freshest bagels...so fresh, almost made me cry. I'm not so fresh when I come out of the shower the way these bagels are  .

Everything bagel w/Dill n Garlic Cream Cheese! - @whatabagel130spadina"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I were in the mood for soup so we headed over to What A Bagel. 2 of us ordered the Vegetable and Lentil and one got the Chicken Noodle. When we got back to the office, all 3 of us had the same container of sad broth. There was no lentils in the Vegetable soup whatsoever, and no chicken OR noodles in the so-called chicken noodle soup. All that was visible was some onion, mushrooms and green peppers in a broth in all 3 containers. How can you serve a soup without any lentils or chicken? If you don't have enough ingredients left in the pot of soup, STOP serving the soup. We would have gone back to complain but we had a meeting we could not miss. Will never get soup from here again."}
{"text":"Yum yum!  Like some of the other reviewers, I've never sat down here either, but they have a very efficient self-serve setup with tongs to grab whichever bagels you want, bag them up, and get in line.  Not only do these bagels taste great, but they are a great deal for downtown.  I don't remember what I paid for a half-dozen, but it was like a third of the price of what I paid at the newer, cafe-themed bakeries (those are delicious too, but they get a bit pricey after a while).  It's a bit of a walk from my place, but who doesn't love walking down Queen West and taking in all the sights and shops along the way.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Fresh fruit that actually tastes like real fruit. Great neighborhood shop. Good variety. Grab a bag of sweet pastries to go while you wander the city. I had the yogurt parfait which was perfection."}
{"text":"Great bagels - wonky pricing. I just paid $4.29 for a sesame bagel with dill cream cheese.
My friend had a bagel with cheddar & tomato, plus a huge dessert and it was only $5!
The pricing needs some adjusting! Great food though."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!  Staff members eating at a table while there is a full lineup of people waiting to be seated.  Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I walk past this place everyday so I was excited to check it out.  I tried a bagel with dill cream cheese the first day and it came to $3.88.  Left me thinking Tim Horton's (which is across the street)... is not that bad.  Next time I tried it the girl at the cash asked me \"what kind of cream cheese?\".  When I announced it was 'dill' in a tone like \"what difference does it make?\"....the price shot up to $4.85.  Which means they are charging customers 15 cents for every sliver of dill.  I think I'll stick with Tim's until they bring their prices back down to reality."}
{"text":"A friend and I work in the Spadina & King area and have walked past the What A Bagel Eatery several times to witness them in the midst of construction and renovation the past few months. Last week, we noticed what seemed like customers eating there but a great big sign that reads 'Grand Opening - April 24th, 2012' led us to believe that it was by invitation only. 

Yesterday, we decided to walk in to check the place out and it turns out that the owners were opening up their restaurant and giving away FREE (I love anything free!) food for 2 weeks to promote their business, to give consumers a taste test, and to garner some feedback. So here's MY feedback:

Environment: Any place that is newly renovated always looks nice and inside What-A-Bagel Eatery was no exception. More than the furniture though is the friendliness of the staff. The owner, Isaac was shaking hands with new customers and really seemed to go out of his way to ensure that his customers were happy. The servers were also great, I think she introduced herself as Vanessa if I recall and she was super helpful with menu selection.

Food: I ordered the Chophouse Burger, steak topped with horseradish cooked to perfection inside a bagel bun. Wow these bagels.... is all I have to say! They were even kind enough to allow everyone to take home some bagels. My friend ordered the Dizengoff burger and enjoyed his meal as well. They also serve a wide selection of breakfast for early birds.

Price: I believe I overheard the owner saying the price point would be $9-$13 for lunch but there are many things on the menu that are cheaper too.

I decided to give this place 5 stars not only because the food is great, but the entire experience was wonderful. What-A-Bagel Eatery is a place I can see myself stopping by a few times a week on the way to work."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are generous.  Service is not bad, but food took a bit to arrive.  Prices are reasonable.

Menu selection is plentiful - will come back to check out more of their food!  Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh bagels along the wall. Grab one along with a bag for it and head to the toppings counter. There you'll find many different yummy cream cheeses and veggie toppings. I had the dill cheese with crispy lettuce and crunchy sprouts. Delicious! And very quick too. They have an eggs breakfast special in the mornings that looks like a great deal with unlimited coffee. Plus a happy hour after work. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker for lunch, even though I'm gluten-free and wary of places like this (though there is a biiiig sign in the window about gluten free products). We sat down and I asked what gluten free products were available. I was told that the wraps can be GF as well as the bagels. So I ordered a wrap, but as it turned out they were out. 
Now I'm not a picky orderer, I love all the foods, so this isn't the kind of thing to irritate me whatsoever. I ordered a salad instead ($12), and had low expectations because this didn't seem like the type of place to order a salad. But feeling in need of some real food and feeling hopeful, I went ahead & ordered the goat cheese and arugula salad. This came with a 'side' of their GF bagel (for an extra $2). 
So, the bowl was massive (more arugula than a person should really eat in one sitting) with a few cherry tomatoes, and a few (probably canned) roasted red peppers and a bunch of breaded goat cheese balls. Everything tasted OK, and I appreciate that they have something almost healthy looking on the menu but WOW, this isn't something I would ever eat again. It needs way more salad stuff you guys!
Maybe it's just me, but if you're gonna serve salad, why not do it right? Gluten free folk would flock to your restaurant with their gluten-friendly pals and everyone would win. 
Also - on a positive note, our waitress was really lovely."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday with two others.  Waited about 20 minutes just to get a table.  Waitress came by pretty quickly.  We all ordered a soup (chicken noodle) with sandwiches.  Soup was pretty good, better with a little pepper added.  I got the \"Old School\" sandwich which is fried salami, boiled egg, pickles and grainy mustard.  It was pretty good, very filling.  I got 1/2 dozen bagels to take home with some Portuguese custard tarts, everything got devoured within an hour of me getting home (4 kids...) All in all a good experience despite the wait, I will definitely go back even just to buy bagels or sweets."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 2:00pm

Pros: 

- Larger selection on their menu compared to a couple of other what a bagel restaurants
- Servers were polite and professional 


Cons:
- Slow service 
- They really cheep out on toppings when you order food. I ordered a tuna Jerusalem Toast and I felt like I was just eating a piece of toast (without the cheese/tuna and sauce)."}
{"text":"I kept going back to this place after my initial crappy experience and I can admit they are getting into a groove. Still a bit over priced and still have an unfriendly girl on cash in the am, but overall, getting pretty good. I enjoy a morning bagel, smoothie and coffee (for just over $13...) and it's pretty delicious. 

It's worth giving a few tries to as each trip in brings a slew of emotions but I would hate for you to miss out on something delicious."}
{"text":"Would not recommend.  Got our order incorrect (which is understandable).  The waiter offered to comp the meal and then, after we paid, we noticed this was not done.  After contacting management, nothing was done to rectify this issue.  Will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm sure the bagels here are delicious (they looked like it) but my breakfast was not. I got the lox scramble with rye toast. The eggs were way overcooked and the lox was not that good. The was fine, but not what I was expecting for rye toast. 

My friend got a breakfast burrito and said it was also mediocre. It was a lot of food though, but I wouldn't come here again unless it was for a bagel to go."}
{"text":"All I have to say is FANTASTIC!!!

I am quite particular with my food and I must say that the food here is great, healthy and tasty. It is diverse enough for everyone. I read the reviews about the price, I don't think some people realize that this is quality food, not a drive through mass marketing fast food joint...remember you get what you pay for.

My daily lunch spot for sure....try the asian chicken salad.... and the pastries yummy!, I tried to say no but I can't resist the scent! :))"}
{"text":"Went here in the morning after a night out and it was a GREAT decision. Grabbed a breakfast bagel (egg, bacon, veggies and some sauce) for $5 (tax incl) and I wasn't disappointed. Seemed quite busy on this particular Saturday morning, so finding a spot was difficult and we just had take out. 

Next time I'm in I have to try to buy some of the bagels, at $6/dozen or $3/dozen day olds I think this will be my new go to place for bagels. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can deal with the absurdly overpriced sandwiches that are passable at best. I can deal with the slow service that is passable at best. What I can not deal with is the way that they butcher my bagel with their horrid knifemanship. It's not a particularly hard thing to do and I feel like a professional bagel cutter should be able to cut my bagel in a way wherein I'm not currently saddled with a sesame seed twister where 75 percent of the bagel has somehow ended up on the bottom half of the bagel.

Also, if every single person is asking you to run their bagel through the toaster twice may I suggest you turn the toaster from \"Hey, is this thing even on?\" to \"medium\"?

Well, it can only go up from here this morning!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a breakfast bagel after my morning workout. The wait was way too long. If you're ordering to go you better expect to wait a long time. The bagel itself was fine (BELT bagel) but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Third time here - now I get why the patio was jam packed all summer long. Can't decide which I love more, the big, delicious salads or the Latka Hash Eggs Benedict. Genius."}
{"text":"I prefer NY style bagels over Montreal style any day (haters gon hate! I don't care!).  
These are really great, thick, doughy bagels, and I like them. A lot.

Good breakfast, delicious bread.  I had a grilled cheese with caramelized onions and it rocked my world.  Their WAB salad is also great, lots of flavour and not at all stingy on the delish toppings like goat cheese and red pepper.  

I shall be back immediately. If not sooner."}
{"text":"Food is a 5, service is a minus 46777443.
I wish I could remember her name, I have her every single time I'm there. Brunette, average height, pretty but tired face. SHE'S HORRIFIC. She ruins every meal I have there, she's condescending and snarky AND she never refills your water or checks on you. If you need her you literally have to get out of your seat and track her down.

My friend ordered tuna salad once and asked if there were onions in it bc IT'S FUCKING TUNA SALAD and this asshole actually smirked and said if there were onions in it, it would be on the menu and then rolled her eyes. Like blatantly, not side eyes, not a bad day, just an awful waitress. Every question I've ever had about the menu or adding/subtracting something has been met with the most obvious impatience. She's unbearable. Last time I was there I purposely changed seats to be in another servers section."}
{"text":"Super awesome bagels and still warm when they're put into the paper bag. I picked up a dozen for a breakfast along with the cream cheese. As I was picking up the cream cheese, a fellow patron said to me 'go for the large size, it will be used up!' Sure enough it all went! So light and not a heavy cream cheese taste or texture.  Sitting on the patio outside for the start of the day with my warm bagel and americano was awesome. 
Not a fancy place but they have everything."}
{"text":"Shout out to Danielle at the Spadina and Camden location for the best service. Been to every location and she kills it."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their service (not too friendly and sometimes the wait time is long for takeouts), but the food is great and the location is great with nice outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"The day-old bagels and the pastries are the main thing that I get. The pastries are ridiculous, especially the buffalos, I mean, it's huge and chocolatey and delicious. The day-old bagels are like $3 for a dozen. The other stuff is fine, but nothing to write home about. 
Generally it's pretty quick, though at lunch there is a huge line."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!  
The staff is super friendly.
The place is clean. 
And did I mention that the food is amazing? 

You pay for what you get, i see lots of complaints here on yelp about the prices, But even the ones complaining about price say the food is amazing... if you want a dirt cheep breakfast you should go to Tim Horton or mcdonnalds as this place is not for you, but. If you are looking for top quality delicious brunch style food you cannot beat this what a bagel!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had an overall pretty good experience. The food wasn't a huge standout but the prices were reasonable. I would probably come back for takeout."}
{"text":"A very disorganized place, there's 3 lines (one to build your bagel, one for the cashier and one for sit down) and no direction or signs on where to line up. Bagels are okay though"}
{"text":"I agree with Stacey C about the Ritual App 3 posts below! Every single time I use the Ritual app, I am still always waiting to pick up my order, and sometimes my order is all ready, but I still have to wait for someone to approach me just to let them know that I'm there for my pickup, and then my food is already cold by the time I eat it. 

This morning I placed an order again through the Ritual app because something particularly on the menu caught my eye; Eggs Only, that also offers a choice of a toasted bagel or bread. So I ordered this, however when I arrived there, I was told that the order doesn't actually come with a bagel or toast, and that the description given in the Ritual app was false. I was already annoyed at the fact that I thought I had paid for something where I really didn't, but the tone in the guy's voice who had to deliver the bad news sounded like I was the one who was inconveniencing him. He said \"That's why it's called 'Eggs Only'\" and even though he didn't, I could almost feel his eyes rolling at me from the behaviour he was giving off. Disgusted already with the experience, I asked if I could just cancel the order because I didn't want to end up paying for something that I felt like I'm not receiving the entire full order for. But he said that it would have to be done through Ritual and that he couldn't refund me. Annoying, right? Because I paid through the app, they wouldn't give me a refund under any circumstance. I wasn't going to walk out empty handed with the 50/50 chance that the Ritual app would ACTUALLY give me money back. So I told the guy to go ahead with the order. Then to add insult to injury, the guy had the nerve to say to me \"You can still have the toast, you just have to pay for it\". 

That was unnecessary. What was even more unnecessary was his sarcastic \"Bye! Have a nice day!\" as he gave me my single, stand alone hard-boiled egg with no toast, and turned around immediately and disappeared to the kitchen like he didn't want to have to deal with me anymore. 

Yes, it's Ritual's fault for providing false information, but the customer service from this restaurant is just disgusting. I feel like if this were any other restaurant, they probably would've just given me the toast for free for the inconvenience, apologize like they actually mean it and then deal with their loss with Ritual (as I believe what SHOULD HAVE happened at What A Bagel).

I have had other terrible experiences here but if I continue on about it, this will be the longest review ever, so I'm just going to leave it at that. 

I can say with confidence though that I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Simply incredible bagels! 

We came to eat lunch, it turns out they have a fantastic menu for dining in! We were just feeling a regular bagel with cream cheese but there are tons of options. The regular bagel came with salad or sweet potato fries, too. 

We came here on my birthday. They do a \"buy 6, get 6 free\" deal on birthdays. Totally worth stopping in! 

I really enjoyed the poppy seed bagel, the everything was great, too. After taking a few home, they were all amazing. 

They offer slightly larger bagels \"twisted bagels.\" They weren't anything special to me personally, so I'll be sticking with their regular sized ones. 

What I wasn't expecting was all of the baked goods they have here! Incredible looking lemon bars and so many other options. I'll be stopping by here to try out their pastries and baked goods for sure! 

All in all, a wonderful option for lunch or taking fresh bagels home."}
{"text":"I started coming here a few weeks ago every day for breakfast. They have the Boost Omelet which is my favourite. It's probably like a 4 egg omelet, chicken, spinach, and peppers, that comes with cheese (which I don't eat), and I have it with sweet potato fries on the side.

The owner's super friendly and service is nice and fast in the morning when I go."}
{"text":"Came mid afternoon when it was more or less dead, ordered a breakfast bagel sandwich, waited 20+ minutes. Finally went to the cashier to ask what was up and was notified breakfast ended a few minutes before I placed my order. Uh??

So essentially - my money was taken and I paid to wait around with no update or heads up from anyone. Got my refund but absolutely ridiculous. Not coming back. 

Don't come here."}
{"text":"I went to What-A-Bagel for the first time few months back. The ordering/paying system is retarded. There is no sign to let you know that you go to the cash line to order something off the menu and if you get a bagel/pastry yourself, you go to the back line for the lady to make it. The lady that makes the food in front of you (large middle eastern lady) is very very slow. For her, the world has stopped and thinks that nothing is happening meanwhile.. the morning rush hour is there. If I were to go to Tim Hortons, I'd get my food very fast because they know that mornings are crazy. What-A-Bagel has the worst organization and their system doesn't make sense. Everything is SLOW. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place for bagels.  It's busy, so some may complain about the service but I've found it okay.  Although I come in the morning..."}
{"text":"I'm generally happy with the service and the food here. My only reservation is that there are many other places around that offer something more exciting and enticing for what you pay. I have only good things to say about What a Bagel  (I'm a regular, after all) so if you want substantial, decent quality food with good service this place doesn't fail. It's also my go-to for raisin challah which I find hard to get in Toronto."}
{"text":"Please take my advice: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! I recently visited this Spadina location and was EXTREMELY disrespected by the manager ISAAC. We waited nearly 30 MINUTES for two breakfast bagels to-go. We didn't even complain that it was taking so long. All we did was ask for a refund and the manager ISAAC told us that they DON'T GIVE REFUNDS!! Is that even true? Maybe the owners should learn about this practice. Then he GRABBED THE ARM of the person I was with when we told him we didn't want the dozen bagels he offered us instead of what we ordered (we wanted our money back after nearly a half-hour wait -- I don't think that's unreasonable!!). Then he wanted to \"speak outside\" and we decided that WE would be the professional ones and leave the place altogether (avoiding a fight) and WE DIDN'T EVEN GET OUR BAGELS! WE LEFT WITH NOTHING AND PAID ALMOST $14!! Everyone needs to BOYCOTT THIS LOCATION!! I've never witnessed such abuse and disrespect on the part of a manager in my entire life. He's lucky he didn't get charged with assault."}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to start off by saying that I hardly EVER write any reviews only because I'm lazy when it comes to writing reviews.  That said, after eating at this What A Bagel on more than one occasion, I just HAD to write a review (after eating there just now again).

This restaurant has to be by FAR the best go to restaurant when it comes to having breakfast or lunch.  I've been to several breakfast / lunch spots, but nothing can compare to quality and freshness of this place.  Everything at this location is made from scratch and made using the freshest quality fruits and vegetables - I know this, because I specifically asked!

The food here tastes so good that it makes me keep coming back for more.  If / when I come in the mornings for a nice breakfast, I'll usually order the Eggs Benedict on a Latka with hollandaise sauce and a small side of cinnamon apple sauce.  For my side, I usually go with the Mediterranean salad (Israeli salad) and a pumpernickel bagel.  My mouth is watering just writing about it.

If I'm coming in for lunch for a nice sandwhich, I'll order one of two things, The Triple Decker Turkey Club sandwich which is a club sandwich on fresh soft challah bread with smoked turkey and turkey bacon OR a Tuna sandwich on a fresh soft challah bread with lettuce, tomato, red onion, avocado, an egg white omlet and a thin layer of cream cheese! - I've ordered this sandwich so many times, that they've decided to name it \"The Dovaleh\" !

I can't get enough of this restaurant, and I highly urge / recommend this place to anyone to come in and try it at least once!  I promise you will not be disappointed!

I hope this review was helpful."}
{"text":"Such a crowded place!! So many people in line, waiting and seated. Got a twisted bagel with plain cream cheese to go and an untoasted plain sesame bagel to go as well.

I was a little disappointed to see that the bagels were New York style and not Montreal style, so when I took a bite my cream cheese bagel, it was soft and bread like, just like eating rye bread. Similarly, my sesame bagel had the same texture. 

Also a little disappointed that the cream cheese didn't have much cheese flavour, it was gooey and sticky."}
{"text":"Very, very, very disappointed in this place.  Not only is it already grossly overpriced, but the waits are often unbearable- both take out and dine-in.  The whole point of Ritual is to avoid wait times, but I've always had to wait every single time- even if I go during the time that the app tells me to.

Today was a whole other animal.  My colleagues and I went there for lunch today to catch some sun and enjoy our break and this was actually some of the worst service I've ever had- not to mention that almost everything we ordered had something wrong with it after arriving over an hour after we sat down.

Lets start with drinks.  Mimosas and caesars.  5 minutes go by and only the mimosa comes out because they're out of clamato as we can see other people on the patios with caesars.  I do believe they were out- but that's when you send someone across the street to buy some.

Next, lunch orders.  Pretty simple orders across the board- nothing fancy.  Over an hour goes by and us having to ask about it twice (not once did we receive an apology from anyone about it) and the food comes out- either incorrect, cold or not at all. We all made do other than the one that was seriously wrong,  but the one hour, twenty minute mark, we finally just had to ask for our bills and for that one replacement meal to just be doggy bagged because it STILL hadn't come out.  The manager said, personally, that he'd go back and whip her up one right then.  He also apologized but said they were slammed- understood.  I've been there many times and have seen that it's always quite busy- but this is beyond anything that's reasonable, honestly.  Nothing was comped other than the incorrect meal that they brought to my colleague and would have thrown out anyways.  1 hour and 20+ minutes for breakfast food and without an apology from our server- who seemed annoyed when I asked for change when I paid.  I have only ever not tipped once before- and I still actually feel guilt-ridden for doing it again, but I will not pay for such poor service- nor will I go there again.  Literally, had she popped over once every 20 minutes just to check on us and apologize for the food taking so long- literally anything other than ignoring us- I absolutely would have tipped her.  I'm not sure if she didn't put our food in or if the kitchen was really that backed up- but that's an issue that needs to be resolved on their end of things and shouldn't cost customers any more money out of their pocket for mediocre service and sub-par food.

We did have one really great experience on the patio once recently- and a girl with shoulder length hair and a nose ring served us.  She was wonderful- so that's why we decided to come back.  It's too bad- great patio otherwise, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Welcome to my weekend breakfast spot.  

The coffee is amazing here, the bagels are freshly made in house and the patio......wow.  

If I had to give you some con's, sometimes they are so busy food takes a while and from time to time the produce they garnish the plates with isn't as fresh as it should be.  

The portion sizes of their \"scoops\" has also shrunk over time.  

But man I love coming and enjoying a summer morning with the paper and a smoked salmon platter.   

Try the dizzengoff sandwich!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother they have very fresh bagels as well as day-old and very fresh thick bread! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A very stylish coffee shop on Spadina! I love their to go cups. Nice thick delicious coffee. Nice ambience. Would highly re contend this place to sit and chit chat and drink up."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise...

Came here for brunch expecting a great selection of fresh bagels. But this place has so much more to offer. For one, there is dine-in seating, booth style. There isn't too many spots, so I would recommend making a reservation. We came here for Sunday brunch around 1130am and it was busy.

I like the look. Modern and casual. What blew me away was the menu itself. There are multiple breakfast options, including a great selection of omelettes. I went with the mushroom omelette, side house salad and pumpernickel bagel. YUMMY! I was impressed with the size of my omelette (3 eggs), I could only finish 2/3 of it. The salad was well flavoured. And my bagel fresh. All this for $11-12. Great affordable alternative to Cora's or eggsmart. More so, for a health conscious eater like me, the grease level was very modest."}
{"text":"I love this place, for breakfast and lunch. Go for happy hour and order the wraps, amazing. If you go for breakfast after 10 or 11am (on weekends), expect to wait a while. I only sit in their booths, the tables are way too close to each other and, i don't know about you, but i don't want a stranger so close they can taste my food. There is definitely room for improvement, as with anywhere, but my biggest suggestion is to open another one because they are too busy all the time. That's a compliment, and especially for take out you will definitely enjoy. Oh ya, get the Asian Chicken Salad! It's enormous. I can finish it but that is your week's worth of daily veg so maybe best to share. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service and odd policies.  
I came here one morning with my family.  It was packed as usual, with people crowding at the door, hungry, and waiting to be seated.  Everyone was huddle together with nowhere to move and it was winter so every time the door opened we all got hit with snow and cold air. 
I noticed several table with people just talking. They had finished their meals and even finished their coffee. I asked the host why they haven't been given a bill or asked if others could use the table and she said that 'they were allowed to ask people to leave'
I explained to her that there were 15 hungry people standing at the door waiting to be seated and she shrugged and smiled. 
The customers that were taking up the tables proceeded to sit there and chat for another 20 minutes, while we all stood and watched. It was the most unusual and unprofessional thing I have ever seen in such a busy diner. 
I would not recommend this place. The food is average and definitely not worth standing in line for 20-30 minutes. The staff are rude and the owner doesn't know how to run a business. If you're in the King West area try Cora's or any other place that actually treats customer well."}
{"text":"The service at this place just gets worse and worse. It's confusing to order. You have to go to one place to order this and another place to order that. Nothing is clearly marked and the staff are so rude. Today I waited over 10 minutes to pay for my bagel and juice while staff just walked by me ignoring me as I stood at the cash. Finally one came over and rolled her eyes at me like she was doing me a favour. I then waited another 15 minutes for a cappuccino. No one apologized, no one explained the wait. They just ignored me. I've given this place several chances, but won't be giving them any more of my money. Avoid at all costs unless you like being treated like crap and waiting a really long time for a bagel and coffee."}
{"text":"Sorry I had to remove 1 star but the service quality decrease a little bit since the beginning... 
The Food qualify is still very good tho!"}
{"text":"So there are two sides to this place. 

1. They make some really, really good salads and bagel sandwiches.
2. They have some of the slowest service in the world. For a place that makes a fairly limited number number of things and has an abundance of staff it doesn't make any sense that it should take that long. 

The later of the two is why I give it two stars, just not worth it. I have gone back a couple times to try it again, just because the sandwiches and salads are quite good. I always ended up frustrated that I gave it another chance though....5 min lunch turn into 25 very quickly in that place."}
{"text":"I usually get my breakfast here, my usual is a pumpernickel bagel toasted with chive cream cheese. I add cucumbers and alfalfa sprouts and it's super delicious. The lineup can get a bit long so I usually just ritual it when I'm walking in to work and it's ready by the time I get there.

Taking a few stars off because a couple times when I've ordered my bagel and opened it up at the office, it would be wrapped kind of sloppy and seeds would spill everywhere. This wouldn't normally be an issue for me, but the seeds didn't come from my bagel, it would be from a previous customer's because there are no poppy seeds on pumpernickel. This would be a cross contamination issue if I was allergic to poppy seeds. There was another incident where a friend was ordering lox and bagel and made a request for no onions, the lady preparing it forgot and put some on. My friend politely reminded her and she removed them and threw them back in the onion container with cream cheese still stuck to it. There's definitely some food handling issues that needs to be addressed. 

Besides those incidents, I still come back because they still have the best bagels on the block."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. The North York location is better.
I ordered a toasted breakfast sandwich to go. The bread was not toasted and the egg was so burnt. It was disgusting. Also, when I ordered, they said \"they always toast sandwiches,\" which is untrue.  For such a busy restaurant you would hope for good quality food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the bagel and the customer service was great, can't wait to be back dt Toronto to sit down and really enjoy a nice morning here."}
{"text":"I had Dizengoff sandwich combo. The sandwich is made of chicken schnitzel, diced fresh cucumber & tomato, and lettice with hummus sauce. The fries that comes with the sandwich is  amazingly good. They are as almost crispy as a cracker."}
{"text":"This place is my hangover go-to when I need a quick breakfast before heading into the office. Their breakfast bagels are the most ginormous things you have ever seen and, unless you're starving, are almost impossible to finish. They're not something I order often, but when I do I always to go for the flax seed bagel. Plus, they're only $5, which considering the portion size, is a great deal. 

As for the standard bagel bar, it's top notch. You can get cream cheese and a variety of toppings. One time I was standing in line and the girl in front of me ordered cream cheese, tomatoes, pickles and sprouts. This sounded so intriguing I had to try it, and now it's what I get pretty much every single time I find myself here. Try it, I dare you!

As for smoothies, I'm addicted to the Date Me. It's a weird name that I don't particularly like ordering, but it's really good. I have actually since learned to recreate it myself with great success, but on occasion I still find myself ordering it here. 

I've never eaten in the restaurant part, but the menu is tempting. Perhaps one day when I have more time I will venture here for a more conventional brunch option. 

One last thing to note, this place is always busy! Sometimes you have to wait a bit, but I assure you it's worth it. Fresh tasty bagels always are."}
{"text":"Bagels are always fresh. I love stopping in on my way to work and starting my day off right."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...despite previous reviews this place has potential...HAS is the word here..

I don't mind paying extra, that's not the point.  I find the service to be iffy and most disconcerting is the fact that sometimes you don't pay the same price for the same item on a different visit.

Stopped in to buy Rugela (Jewish pastries I think) and I thought you have to pay by weight.  BTW, if it's by weight they sure don't have any signs that indicate any kind of price.  I chose a few and went to pay, I was surprised the girl opened the bag and just counted and charged me $4 for around 6.  When I asked if they were priced by the piece not by the pound, she said they were charged by weight but that she can guess how much they are each...?

Another downside is that I went in for Free Bagel day, get six free bagels.  Nice promo.  My brother went and he got four mini bagels and two regular sized bagels.  Not to mention the lady there was surly.  If your going to give customers mini bagels then at least have two mini ones count as one full sized one but alas the four minis were counted as one each.

End of the night I saw staff sweeping out the crumbs in one of hte trays close to flat-bread close in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the baked goods are yummy here. 
They truly are.


BUT --- 

I just find it really ... expensive, for what it is. 
I wouldn't be so nit-picky about the $$ if I thought this stuff was being made by hand but you can see the huge machines in the back.  
I (literally) live around the corner from here, and while it's a special treat I don't pop in regularly because of the prices. Based on the other reviews, I don't even think about picking up lunch not knowing how much it might end up costing.

1/2 doz bagels - $4
Half a loaf of banana bread $4.25 

I love the bagels and baked goods. (but then again, they're the only thing I've tried there).
They're all baked fresh on location, so the chances of picking up a still-warm croissant are high -- the almond croissants are incredible, and I'm not normally a fan of the croissant. The almond croissant is a very fair $2.95. 

The Ruggalach are sold by weight, and they have a few interesting flavors, including chocolate and sugar free fruit preserve variety. 
 

The staff seem a bit stunned.
I was there opening week, and I understood the chaos and having no idea what to do etc .. but the feeling hasn't changed. Even today, the girl at the cash seemed frazzled, dazed and confused. I hate feeling like I need to double check everything to make sure they haven't ripped me off (which was today's feeling, again)."}
{"text":"I had the bagel with egg, waffle, and pancake. I found the food to be very average and I won't  be going back again."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on my first visit to Toronto. I had the eggs benedict, my favorite breakfast dish. I was fairly impressed, and the food and service is definitely deserving of four stars."}
{"text":"The I luh ya papi shake is sooooo good!!! The cookies are gooey and really good as well.."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come to this place for a while, finally came in for brunch!  I love the smell of bakeries, so that was definitely a plus.  The food was decent, the server was friendly and witty.  Next time, I'd probably return for their baked goods rather than sit in for food."}
{"text":"This is a solid lunch spot. I've always done takeaway so I can't speak to table service. They do have some lovely outdoor seating facing Camden St in the summer months.

They do everything from hot bevvies to smoothies to salads, sandwiches and wraps. I'm a big fan of their custom sammies, more  precisely because of their bread selection (go for challah, so good!) and vast selection of fillings. My usual go to is asian chicken salad, it even comes with a bagel.

Last note, bagels are New York/Krakow style bagels. Fluffy and carby. If you're fond of Montreal bagels a la St. Urbain these are not for you. 

Don't forget to come for a dozen free bagels on your birthday."}
{"text":"We checked out What a Bagel for breakfast one morning.

I have to say -- still a fave bagel in the city.  They sure know what they are doing -- the sesame is my \"go-to\".

Hubby had the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and sauteed onions and a bagel with sweet potato fries. Was a generous portion and he was quite pleased with it.

I had poached eggs with turkey bacon and a bagel and home fries.  The eggs and home fries were great and generous in size as well... but this will be my first and last turkey bacon experience.  Just too tasteless for me -- give me the real deal folks! lol

Had great latte's with it, and couldn't resist and bought a few things to take home.  Their bourekas and knishes are yummy, and the rugelach (especially the chocolate ones are da bomb!)

Pleasant service and lots of tables!  They have outdoor seating in the summer."}
{"text":"Maybe I am biased because I am from New England and we have pretty good NY style bagels...but I didn't like the bagels here. After a couple of bites I noticed it had become really flat and didn't have much to it. I had the chive cream cheese and it tasted kind of sour or tart. I ended up wiping most of it off the bagel. 

The service was really slow, there was only 2 people ahead of us and we waited a while to get our cream cheese. I wouldn't come back and would rather go to a different bakery or coffee shop nearby."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot while in Toronto. They have everything you'd ever want and more. I usually go for the shakshuka with salad and fries, or the gluten free wrap with turkey and a salad. I've also previously had their smoothies which are also really good as well. My friend ordered a smores cookie before leaving and he said there weren't enough chocolate chips. I wish they'd promote their gluten free items a bit more as their menu is overloaded with items and hard to decipher what is gluten free. Either way, I'll definitely be back when I'm in Toronto for the Shakshuka!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided to treat ourselves to a light brunch at What a Bagel on Sunday.  We've had the delicious bagel to go in the past but had never dined in. We figured our take out experience (fast, friendly and enjoyable) would be similar if not the same as the dining experience - were we ever wrong! 

We waited roughly 15 minutes for a table (nothing of a surprise being a Sunday afternoon downtown Toronto). It wasn't until we were seated when our experience went downhill.
1) Our waitress came to our table 2 minutes after we arrived and took our drink orders: 2 orange juices and 1 latte. It took 10 minutes for the orange juices and 15 minutes for the latte after having to follow up with the waitress.
2) We ordered a salad and bagel to share. One would think that of all the menu items, a salad and bagel would be simple to prepare and quick to arrive. Wrong! Almost nearly 30 minutes of waiting, and asking for an ETA in our food from the waitress, my boyfriend and I were at wits end and not to mention starving at this point. 
3) We asked to speak to a manager to express our dissatisfaction. The manager appeared, hands in her pockets, stand off-ish and genuinely disinterested in what we had to say.  After we said what we felt was fair to say, she rolled her eyes, said 'sorry to hear you've not had a good experience' and walked away.
4) Our food arrives, and not once are we approached to ask how our food is tasting or apologizing for the delay.
5) We finally ask for our bill expecting to see some form of saving grace following the extremely poor service and length of time waiting for our food. Again, we were wrong! They wouldn't even remove the cost of the cream cheese, offer a complimentary orange juice or latte. However after having to express to our waitress who was blind to the horrible experience we were having, she finally offered to give us a few 'sweets to go' as we were half way out the door. 

Needless to say we had a horrible experience from a guest experience perspective. The food was fantastic but the quality of service and disrespect received from the manager left a horrible taste in our mouth - bad enough to not return."}
{"text":"This place is too pretty to be a lacklustre bagel shop. 

I've popped in here twice and find it ridiculous that I have to pay close to $7 for a simple breakfast bagel (eggs, turkey bacon and cheese). And the bagel is good but you know, $7 worth? I don't think so. 

Both times I visited the staff seemed off-putting. They're not rude but a little spaced and not very organized. 

On the plus side, they sell freshly-baked bread like rye and challah for a reasonable price. I think I'll be coming here for their loaves and just stick to my usual and cheaper to-go breakfast place instead."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst service in Toronto. Truly astounding. We've been here for 40+ minutes and just got our drinks. The servers are glacial and act like they're annoyed to be there (so am I). 

Had to ask 3 separate waiters for water and ended up being there for almost 2 hours... and we only ordered bagels. 

Will never come back here."}
{"text":"Disappointed as smoked salmon bagel came with one tiny slice of salmon! Does not look at all like the picture! Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Worst place to have breakfast or lunch in the entire spadina ave. if you are the type of people who enjoy home made meals well, be ready to be disappointed, we had to wait more then 30 min for a simple breakfast order, and half of the meal was cold, service was terrible and price is not right for of what you get, believe me better you go across the street and buy at tims or aroma or starbucks, but this place is just poor in everything, plus was the smallest steak I had in my entire life."}
{"text":"Bagels are awesome. But that's about it. Insane pricing, and even if you're the only one in there you need to be prepared for it... to... take... forever... 

I've tried a few times, and same same. Not at all worth the wait when there are so many options around there. Pretty great when someone caters a breakfast meeting with these guys though."}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes after ordering for our food at lunch time. The manager delivered the food and apologized for the wait by using the excuse, \"the burger meat takes a while to cook\". Looking inside the bun though, the meat was smaller than the size of my fist. That piece of meat would not take 40 minutes to cook.

We had to get our food to-go as we basically spent our entire lunch hour waiting for the food and then paying way more than we should've paid for the quality of it.

The food was okay, but nothing special. Everything need more seasoning and flavours. The presentation makes the food look a lot better than it is.

With Fresh across the street, go there instead."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty tasty,  albeit a little pricey.... I mean an 8 Oz cup of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice costs 5 dollars! We didn't order this, but I desired some juice and saw these ones up in coolers close to the ordering windows. That's a fairly extravagant price though, 5 bucks for a cup of juice. I could go to the supermarket and buy an entire carton of juice for the same or less and it would be way more than one serving! 

My partner ordered a wrap while I had their Cobb salad. A plus for those that don't eat pork. All their bacon is substituted for \"Turkey Bacon\", which is a great alternative! When we went, a Saturday morning, they were incredibly busy. I'd expect nothing less from a brunch/breakfast joint, yet the service did suffer due to this time. I'd recommend going at a less busy time. 

Over all delicious food (8 out of 10). I had to wait around as the server brought me my forgotten avocado. Semi poor service (it has the potential to be good - 6 out of 10). Oh yeah, again if you desire a spot that isn't next to your table neighbours, looking to get their between hours that aren't busy... mid morning during the week perhaps? Ed and I were pretty much dinning with those next to us.  I'm sure that's not what most people want. So atmosphere a errrrr 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"Pro:
+ patio
+ cheap wrap after 3pm

The locale: 
During summer it has a nice patio.  Inside is clean.

The food:
The wraps and sandwiches are tasty and good.  After 3pm they have half of on all wraps, with fires you get a very filling meal for around $7."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on the weekend for a quick brunch bite. Their bagels are fresh and warm. 

My only complaint (and not totally their fault) was the wait. My friends and I could not get a seat inside so we ordered, and waited at least 10-15mins to get bagels to go. It would be ideal to help prioritize or serve up the to-go crowd faster than the dining room folks."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Take out or sit in the food is great! 
I love their bagels, duh but you can make great filling sandwiches. I like going a cream cheese with lox and cucumber with alfalfa sprouts and tomatoes. Soooo good. 
They have baked good like cookies and richolah (not sure how to spell that one) 
They also have nice salads. Great for lunch and adding the chicken is always a good call. I got here many times a month."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick, inexpensive bagel for breakfast and found this place, relatively close to our Airbnb. They have sit down service and takeout service, where you can just grab a bagel or order breakfast and go. We sat down for breakfast on a Friday morning and it was great! We ordered the oreo nutella french toast and a twister bagel with eggs and turkey bacon (french fries/ home fries with your breakfast sandwich are also so good). The caramel iced coffee is also great and they serve it in cute mason jar glasses. I think this place resonated well with me because it was most like a bagel shop back home in NY."}
{"text":"I was definitely disappointed coming downtown, for a lox and cream cheese bagel. Almost 11$ for fries and about 3 slices of smoked salmon on a bagel with cream cheese. Knockoff."}
{"text":"This place is fortunate to be one of the only breakfast places in the area. Food tastes good enough, prices are scaled to downtown living (read overpriced) and service is mediocre. My 5 year old and I come here regularly enough simply because it's down the street.

Today, we ordered, among other things, a bowl of berries for $5.99 to go with our pancakes and eggs. The bowl arrived 3/4 full. Part way through the bowl, I found a mouldy blueberry. I pointed it out to the server and said that we wouldn't be eating the berries. As a mea culpa, somebody brought over a cup of a dozen \"fresh\" blueberries.

When we went to pay for our breakfast, I was surprised to see that the berries were still on the bill. The server was embarrassed to have asked the manager to remove the item from the bill only to come back to say that the item would remain. $6 for a bowl of food with mould in it. The person that said no was 5 feet away from us so I said that I don't expect to pay for the item. He turned around to ask whether or not we finished the fruit. At this point, another decision maker came in to say that they would remove the charge. Kudos to the server taking our money for not dying of embarrassment.

Needless to say, we'll be keeping away for a while.

This visit was on October 11 & we cashed out by 10am."}
{"text":"Sooo the only thing negative about this place is their seating tables are too close together..how close I learned the hard way when I was trying to squeeze my JLO behind pass a table and knocked the water down on the table beside me.  For a moment I was in no mans land. I was standing between tables vertically and couldn't move so I just wiggled my way out, apologized to the onlookers beside me and waited for another table... I knew I should of greased my hips this morning..

Ok now that we are pass this scuffle on to the food..

I ordered an almond milk latte..which was great..for most sit down bagel places their latte is not bad.

I ordered their original Hash under the Latke section which consists of latke hash brown, sour cream, poached eggs, and with a side of potatoes.. Yes Carb over load at $13.99. It was delicious indeed as I am having this dish for a second time here.

This place dishes out delicious Bourekas filled with potatoes, mushrooms, cheese, and more..aside from being a sit down cafe it's also a big to go self serve bakery..

With beautiful large windows face Spadina st perfect for watching rain, or people and food being consistent and delishhhh I give this place a good hearty 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch today and I was disappointed with the way that the staff handles 
their table reservations.  It seems like if you know the owner/manager, you can skip the reservation list and you get the next available table. I was really turned off when I saw this happening with our reservation and I was even more frustrated when the staff admitted that this happens often and that they're frustrated about it as well.
Even if the food was okay, I am not going to recommend this place to anyone because I wasn't a fan of the favoritism that's happening between the owner/manager and his ''friends''. 

P.S Thank you for the Free Coffee promo."}
{"text":"Solid choice as they have pretty much everything you can think of for bagels. With substitutions.

Went Saturday at 1245 - got seated 20 min later, not many tables inside so wait can be long. Staff is excellent. 

Bakery: got the creamed horn and raspberry scone ($5 altogether) both really good. I'd recommend warming the scone in the microwave and pair it off with a coffee... Deeeelicious.

Food: decided to try eggs Benyamin $12 includes poached egg with turkey bacon and hollandaise ... Wouldn't recommend, not enough hollandaise sauce and it mostly tasted yolky. Bagel was still good though, cheese! They also ran out of home fries :(

Friends got 2 eggs with turkey bacon. $8 They liked it. Pretty much a guarantee as you can't go wrong with the simple things. Cream cheese on the side is $4 and I've been told its heaven. 

Coffee is unlimited for under $2. Smoothie for $6 and delicious.

Overall I'd come back to try other things. Probably not the eggs beni again but the past times I've been, its always been good. Make sure to arrive early for seats."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and pricy bagels / smoothies.

I'd rather eat a Timmy's bagel but when you're in the mood for a cream cheese and lox bagel, there just aren't that many places to grab and go one in the area. 

The bagels only had one slice of salmon in them. 2 lox bagels and a smoothie came out to almost $30 dollars. I went on a Saturday morning and the staff weren't all that friendly which isn't a great way to start the weekend.

I'll be going elsewhere for my bagel!"}
{"text":"i love this place! my favs from them are the frenchtoast + almond croissants and the date me smoothie. a bit on the pricey end but very delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Pretty great place. Friendly service. The food is great and the portions are big! They have a big patio. They make all theit bread and most menu items fresh.  Doubbles as a bakery."}
{"text":"Let's start off with, the food is decent: that's not my issue with this place. My issue with it is, it's a place that leaves you feeling worst when you leave, because when you leave you feel awful and, worst, you knew you would but you still went anyway because you think to yourself, \"Self, how can they mess up a sandwich?\" 

I go to this WAB location out of sheer convince but then the service and food is so slow in every possible way that it is no longer convenient. Dining-in is slow. Takeout is slow. Catering is slow. It's all very slow. There's no justification for taking more than an hr to assemble a tuna sandwich and then somehow still give me the wrong order. Or, when I order a plate of pastries in advance for clients, then get there and it's still not ready when they said it would. Then they say, it's still in the oven and there's nothing they can do, so it will be another 5 mins which naturally means 15 mins (of course) and it still found some way to get cold and hard once you get it.

Your time is too precious, don't waste it on decent food. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a godsend on weekday mornings. They have the freshest, chewiest bagels and I'm stunned by how warm and helpful the staff are when most of us haven't even had our first cups of coffee yet.

I've also purchased some fruit platters and baked goods for meetings - really delicious - there were no leftovers."}
{"text":"Cashier was extremely slow and unfriendly - no eye contact, no smile, one of the coldest and meaningless \"thank you\"...
But butter croissants are good and this is one of the first places downtown I would go back for the croissants, despite this bad service.
Other pastries are only ok and i will not try them again. I did not try bagels neither."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! They have big portions. We had the Greek omelette and pancakes with strawberries and Nutella drizzle. They were delicious. There is also outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch, it was nice sitting on the patio for brunch as well. Service decent. Large portions. Would likely come back."}
{"text":"Great food good for takeout during the week only. Slow and very incompetent hostess and customer engagement. Do NOT go for brunch on a Sunday."}
{"text":"First time here & ordered East Coast sandwich and a veggie soup. Yummy

Within walking distance of my condo. I'm happy"}
{"text":"I heard so much hype about this place and never knew what to think. I've been to What A Bagel locations before, why are people calling this the \"best breakfast in Toronto\"? Obviously I had to give it a try and put these lofty reviews to the test. I'm kind of a stuck up jerk that way.

One of the reasons it took me so long to try this place was because it always seems to have a huge line. This time it was okay, only a 25 minute wait. The first thing I noticed sitting down was the menu options. There were a lot of them, and as someone who is often paralyzed by choice, this was horrible (in the best possible way, though). I settled on the cheesy French toast.

The food arrived fairly quickly (I enjoyed a very nice Americano while I waited), and from the first bite I finally understood why this place is so hyped. They have some delicious-looking breakfast classics, and some other more adventurous options I will have to go back to try. 

Overall, if you can get a table without waiting forever, then definitely come here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place except for how over priced it is. I got a bagel and ice coffee. The set up for the store was very confusing. You have to go get the bagel from the back then wait on line for it to get it toasted and get whatever spread you want on it. Then get on another line to pay for it. Just for a pretty below average bagel and decent coffee."}
{"text":"What a Bagel is a nice brunch spot located near the downtown core. Their french toast and pancakes were exceptionally good, with the pancakes being the fluffiest I've ever had. Their hash benedicts are also extremely delicious, especially the ones with Guacamole. 

Some small criticisms: their eggs were small and subpar, and the bacon and sausages felt overcooked. I do not recommend the grand slam, and would instead recommend bagels or French toast. According to the waitress, the steak in the steak and eggs is surprisingly small, so watch out for that. The food also felt a bit expensive for the amount, but definitely still acceptable.

The service was really great. Extremely friendly, great outdoor patio. Pigeons do walk around tho, which I'm not a big fan of.

Overall, a very solid establishment."}
{"text":"Was really busy on Sunday at noon. Food was good but not outstanding.. prices are reasonable though. The sauces are an extra .50 which I wish the server told us beforehand.. but would say the chili/hot sauce is def worth the extra money. Actually spicy and really good. Don't forget to check in for a free coffee!"}
{"text":"Good spot but always super crazy. I've be actually ordered a bagel here before. I usually get a sandwich and drink - my fav is the west coast. Good spot if you're in the area but otherwise there are plenty of other spots in Toronto that are better."}
{"text":"I've always noticed the large lineup at this What-A-Bagel and wondered what the big deal was. It's a bagel shop. I've started coming here for breakfast because they advertise a $5 breakfast bagel (tax included). I was very impressed because it's a great deal. The breakfast bagel is huge! It's a regular bagel (you choose which flavor) with eggs, cheddar cheese, and turkey bacon. Yum! They're also quick to deliver."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Service was terrible. I love what a bagel, and this was a terrible showing. The experience I've had here is by far the worst in the city compared to any other what a bagel franchise. They don't have the same system as other franchises, it's quite weird. I recommend what a bagel, but stay away from this specific location!"}
{"text":"This place is A-OK.

I went on their grand opening day, which also happened to be my birthday! If you don't already know, if you hit What A Bagel on your b-day they give you a dozen bagels for FREE! It might seem like too many bagels, but those suckers freeze well. I especially like their \"everything\" variety. 

Anyhow, aside from my bagel swag, I had an egg salad sandwich on a bagel. For what it is it was way too expensive (almost $10 for a bagel sandwich and a drink). I feel like a bit of a B for complaining about the price after they gave me free food, but when it isn't your special day, that's a lot to spend on a bagel sandwich. 

The staff seemed quite disorganized, but as they had just opened I'm going to let that slide. I'll update my review when I'm next there. Bagel. 

BAGEL GAME: Be the first to tell me how many times I said \"Bagel\" in this review, and I'll buy you a bagel!"}
{"text":"DEADASSSSSSS I LOVE WHAT A BAGEL SO MUCH.
when i get married i want my wedding catered by what a bagel.
when i push a baby out of me i want my husband to bring me what a bagel right as the head is POPPIN OUT!
when i turn 55 and a half i want what a bagel to cater my mid life crisis. 
when i die i want what a bagel to cater my damn funeral!!!
the best item on the menu is the avacado grilled cheese. 
one time i ate it when i was really hungover and then i had like 3 cups of coffee so i was like really full and then i threw up on the highway and i literally went back the next day and ate it again bc nothing can ruin that meal for me.
i love you what a bagel, do you love ME?"}
{"text":"I wrote this draft July of 2013, so this review is of the restaurant back then.  Slow service doesn't even begin to describe the chaos at this restaurant.  The food was okay to good, and my fellow diner's omelette looked pretty good, but for what we ordered, I don't know how it took as long as it did.  We were seated close to the kitchen, so maybe we got a higher dose, bit this place had this permeating aura of chaos.  It also felt, strangely, that there must have been something like one employee for every two customers.  The two of us throughout sitting at our table just kept exchanging these glances across from each other of: wtf?  At one point, my friend commented he felt he was in a parallel universe.  In all, nothing made sense here - everything took forever, and because I needed to get to the airport, and our very simple breakfast took forever to deliver to us, I had just about no time to eat before I had to leave."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. The food is to die for, always so fresh and delicious, and the staff is so friendly and welcoming. The patio is beautiful and I cant even believe they serve alcohol at this location! what a treat! The prices are very reasonable considering the value and the menu is quite extensive. Hardest part is picking only 1 thing to eat, as I want to eat everything! Definitely the best breakfast spot in town, and the only breakfast place I ever go to as they have ruined other places for me by comparison! If you have not eaten here yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Some of the food here is good but I'll never go back to this location opposed to the Thornhill ones.

I came here once and asked my Server if any of the bagels had no sugar because I was on a no sugar detox at the time. I figured it was a long shot but was just curious. She laughed in my face and told me that since I had ordered home fries I might as well be eating sugar because those will get digested into sugar and she's a nutritionist and knows best and blah blah blah blah. I walked out immediately. No way was I being SHAMED in a place where I'm paying to be served. I treat going out as a special occasional thing and there was no way I was spending my hard earned money there. I have never been more disgusted.

I private messaged the owner numerous times to tell him about the incident and he never replied yet he has replied to many bad reviews since. So I'm posting it here :)"}
