{"text":"Just ate here this evening and it was by absolutely fantastic! We went there by accident, and will definitely return! The food was great and the service was amazing. Definitely will make this our \"go to\" place when getting dinner!"}
{"text":"As a sate soup junkie, I am always on the lookout for the next great soup. 

Invited by a friend to Tre Viet, the restaurant easy to find with lots of parking. 

The owner, Wong is a wonderful man, courteous and kind. The staff is EXTREMELY attentive and eager to please. 

The sate soup (creamy peanut) is awesome. Spicy with a sweet finish, lots of veggies and your choice of protein. I get mine with no noodles (helps prevent the carbo coma) - and leaves more room for broth!

I have been back several times over the last week, tried the house special the last time. Spiced beef and onions with steamed rice. Delicious. 

Will be back for sure.

{"text":"Pretty legit place. Kinda hidden and not really eye catching from the front. I told the owner he needed a lion statue, the little cat with the waving paw, or a wacky wavy inflatable guy outside. If you do happen to find it, the food is cheap, good, and they don't play hide and seek with the meat like other places do. All in all, 10/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"I don't know if we went on an off day but my friend and I went for lunch today and were a little disappointed. I ordered the veggie sub, which they said was unavailable because their supplier hadn't arrived yet so I got fried rice instead. My friend got the chicken vermicelli bowl. She said her noodles were very wet, despite adding only a small amount of fish sauce. My fried rice was extremely oily and salty. Maybe you can even see the sheen that coats each grain of rice in the photo. Maybe the chef was out to lunch today but I won't be returning any time soon :("}
{"text":"Tre Viet, Tre Viet, Tre Viet...

We went there because my roommate lost her mind over the fact that they serve actual vegetarian pho. Like made with vegetable broth. So obviously, I also lost my mind because as much as you would think that must be a common thing...it ain't.
So I ordered the veggie pho and BF ordered the spring rolls and beef and noodles dish...bun? Is that bun? Let me check...yes! Bun! 
There was no one else there, to be fair it was late on a Sunday. They were sold out of tofu which she didn't tell me when I ordered but, oh well. 
My soup was fine, a bit bland really, but I am a fan of souper spicy soup (see what I did there?)
BF liked his, it was huge and he said \"rather tasty\".
All in all it was a decent experience. Not mind blowing, not terrible.
And fair prices!"}
