{"text":"Thank god for Curry and Co because now every time my girlfriend and I go for a movie date at Yonge and Dundas, we have replaced Mile Stones and Jack Astros for Curry and Co.  We are still able to get the restaurant quality food for our date, but I just get to save a ton of money as their food is very reasonably priced.  I've become a bit health conscious so Curry and Co is ideal for me because their Bbq is amazing. When i feel like cheating a bit I do have one of their curries and it's nice because they don't splurge it with oil. Then there is their naan. Always fresh out of the clay oven.  After our movie we always come back down and have the fuckha / phuchka (sp? haha) ! For anyone who doesn't know what that is, it is indian/bengali street food. They really know how to make it authentic!  This is an Indian restaurant and as a person from south east asia, i'm usually a brat because I know what the real deal is. I will say Curry and Co is one that really hits home, and they really keep it authentic!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price and one of the newer halal eateries in the downtown area. Good South Asian food!"}
{"text":"Try both beef curry and butter chicken, they are both VERY watery.  The meat portion is very small and the taste is average.  The mango lassi is ok though."}
{"text":"I like the idea that you can get one meat and one veggie curry with naan or rice for 7 bucks. The size is ok and they make the naan to order, although it might be undercooked at thicker ends. The saag paneer was a disappointment. I'll try it again one day and may change the rating to 3 stars, but so far it's a \"Meh\"."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great price. The perfect meal whenever I visit dundas square. The food is fresh. The tandoor naan was blessed!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Biriyani was ok but they have a lot of coriander seeds in it. Kabab was good. The veg choices are just ok with a runny gravy."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious, it's not oily and the staff there are so nice. Plus it's super affordable. I literal I eat here 2-3 times a week and love the flood. I especially love their dhal and Palak paneer. Highly recommend this for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I went there to eat biryani. When I saw Nihari in their menu I couldn't resist ordering it. Very few restaurants in downtown have Nihari on their menu. I wasn't having very high hopes because Nihari is difficult to cook, it contains slow-cooked meat which takes hours to cook. To my surprise it turned out to be delicious. The meat was tender, gravy was thick and spicy. I got a plateful of authentic Beef-Nihari and one big Naan for ~10$. It was a cold day(-5 degrees), suitable to treat taste buds with spicy hot Nihari. Will go back to try their Biryani and Papri Chaat soon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had the chicken curry with naan and rice. No need to get both guys because the naan is huge and very filling. When you order a curry it comes with a choice of rice or naan and a complimentary vegetable. I was hungry and decided to get both rice and naan. Couldn't finish it. The chicken curry was a bit bland for me. It is the least expensive on the menu. It might be worth it to try the more pricier curries if you want richer flavors."}
{"text":"Zero flavour. Banked on the reviews here to make my trip there. Spinach had NO paneer and completely lacked flavour. Chickpeas - only knew they were chickpeas by looking at them - again no flavour. Big disappointment as their menu even advertises palak paneer. Guess they started cheaping out."}
{"text":"When I decided to visit this place, I was not able to locate this place so we changed our plan and went to somewhere else and no one was picking the phone too. But second we finally found out that where exactly is this place. The person working there is nice, he gave me extra naan when I told him about the story(but that naan is not $50 which we spend on that day when his phone is was not working :/ and we were not able to find that place)  Anyways the staff is good, food is good. Recently we had pani puri which was great. Veg thali is great too!"}
{"text":"Nice little place the food court at 10 Dundas East. They have a range of curries and other dishes from between 7 and 8 dollars. Two days ago I got my lunch here. It was roast chicken with naan and mixed veg for 6.99. Very flavourful and a massive portion. Very flavourful chicken and nice veg. Only thing I didnt like was the big cardamon pods with the chicken. I know its traditional but holy cardamon Batman!   I'm a big fan of the little tandoor they have for doing the Naan. It came out piping hot!   Pretty good value and a nice find among all the completing options at Yonge and Dundas."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Good food and a diverse menu w/o being overwhelming. It is well-priced and the staff is friendly.The Nihari was good and so was the biryani (though, a tad salty). Both are not the best I've had in GTA but definitely the best within subway accessible radius. The naan was extremely fresh - truly a game changer with Nihari. Bonus points for serving hot gulab jamun for dessert.   If you're not looking to make the trek via buses, it's conveniently located in the Yonge/Dundas food court in the AMC building. Double the bliss by catching a movie at the theatre after your meal! ;)"}
{"text":"It is like visiting your friend who is aspiring to become a youtube 'foodie' star but getting that aspiration side alone.   Severely disappointing considering some of the previous reviews were out-of-this-world 5-stars. Please enable a negative point systems to encourage a more authentic review. 1-star is quite considerate for this 'trying' fast-food joint.   Our orders included the vegetarian biryani and butter chicken with saag aloo and rice - The overall taste was beyond bland, we wondered if they overworked the whole 'Canadianize' bit.  Would never return. Would never recommend. Giving it a 3/10 feels too generous."}
{"text":"The most affordable Indian dishes downtown. The staff are extremely friendly and are more than happy to let you sample the dishes. Some dishes are vegan (I was told), and I like that they're not super oily. The samosa chaat is very cold though, I'm not sure if it's because of the sauces or if the samosa itself is cold. Other restaurants serve it warm which is my preference."}
{"text":"My fine dining (read: food court) partner and I both ordered the 2-option veggie plates ($6.20 each tax in) and between us tried all of the vegetarian items that were available: chana masala, palak paneer, aloo matar and mixed vegetables - all of which we decimated with the piping hot accompanying naan. Everything was tasty especially the peas, which were a highlight. My only grievance/suggestion - palak or saag paneer is usually my favourite (duh) and this one was good, but could have used a lot more cheese!  Lovely woman at the counter was patient while we figured out what to get and helpfully economized our order. Overall a nice Y&D option that I'll return to."}
{"text":"2.5 (I wouldn't go again for this specific meal) I got the $6.99 (+ tax) medium spice level chicken biryani student special (comes with mango lassi and raita). Price was decent and the side items were great but the chicken biryani itself was unbearably SALTY.  I still ate it because the spices/taste were good as well as the size of the chicken drumstick they give you and because I'm broke. The raita sauce helped to tone down the saltiness but the biryani itself was so hard to eat."}
{"text":"They are closed!!!  Please come back soon i used to enjoy your spicy chicken karahi during my lunch.you guys are being missed badly.i cant find such good portion and excellent taste of food in so reasonable price as this place had.i hope they come back very soon;("}
{"text":"A very accessible place to get Indian food. It is difficult to find Indian food downtown without having to walk 10 minutes. I work and study in the Ryerson community so this joint is perfect!   The food is tasty and inexpensive. My favourite is their curry fish, which they only have on occasions. It salty, spicy and fragrant in every way. Their butter chicken is on a the sweet side, the beef curry is what you'd expect. Biryani is abundant. You must try the Paneer Palak, spinach with cheese, its def my fave veg.   4 stars instead of 5 is due to inconsistencies. Sometimes the sauce would be too runny or other times the food isn't piping hot.  In spite of that, keep up the good work guys and girls at Curry & Co."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had a butter chicken meal here. The sauce for butter chicken was not creamy enough. But the portion is big and the taste is good too. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good curry near Yonge & Dundas/Ryerson at incredibly reasonable prices. I've only been here once so far for the Beef Curry, but it was good, and incredibly filling. Lunch and a drink was $10. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Having read some good reviews about this restaurant, I went looking for Curry & Co a while ago but did not find it. I had thought it was in the Yonge-Dundas food court downstairs, but it is actually in the upper food court below the Cineplex cinemas. Since I was in the area yesterday afternoon, I took the opportunity to check them out. It's typical food-court location, with most of the food on display in warming trays. The service was polite, and it only took a few minutes to get my meal.  I ordered the medium-spicy chicken biryani. Although it came with only one piece of chicken on top, it was still a fairly good-sized portion, and was very tasty with some noticeable spice. I was offered any type of sauce on the side also, so I had the butter chicken sauce. The combo with a small mango lassi was $6.99+tx. The other menu items were as expected: various curries, tandoori chicken, a few vegetables options, and a street-food snack menu (served after 2pm). Overall, I was quite satisfied with my meal, as good as I would expect to have in a food court."}
{"text":"So hard to find.   Third floor food court in the corner close to the bathrooms. it's in the same building as the movie theater.   lamb curry and spinach veggie dish was quite delicious - not freshly made but I guess stews are never freshly made cuz that's just impossible.   Will come again."}
{"text":"I'd say you get what you pay for on this one. $9 total got me a meat and veg and a naan. It was all 'meh'. The workers were nice enough and I actually like this food court better than the Eaton Center in terms of being a little more laid back. But this wasn't great Indian food.  If you need your Indian fix for under $10, I guess this will suffice."}
{"text":"I've tried the lamb curry, the beef curry, and the fish curry. All were flavorful and much better than typical indian food court fare (better than Amaya in the Urban Eatery IMO - the meat was fairly tender in all three dishes). The samosas are excellent and the mango lassi is good too.   Pros: - Fresh naan made to order right in front of you - Tasty  - Cheap - most combos are $6.99 - Large servings  Negatives: - On the salty side - I think the curry peas dish uses peas from a can but it still tastes great  I think this and Milos are definitely the best options in this food court."}
{"text":"- What I have tried: (each, except chicken biriyani, is a combo that comes with a side of vegetable and rice)     + Chicken biriyani ($6.49): It was good, I enjoyed the biriyani rice and chicken was so tender. It did not come with a side of vegetable and they gave too much rice as compared to chicken. I like this dish but still prefer chicken biriyani at Curry Kitchen (church/dundas) just because it's cheaper and same quality.     + Butter chicken  ($7.99): love love this dish. Chicken was so tender and the sauce was soooo well made, as good as the one i have tried in Indian restaurant but with much affordable price.     + Lam Curry ($7.99): a bit spicy for my taste, but the meat was tender and overall a good dish.     + Chicken Masala (forgot the price): flavour was very well balanced. Again, chicken was tender, the sauce was not as strong as butter chicken's sauce but I like it a lot. I got this with biriyani rice instead with white rice, and it turned out that they went very well together.     + Chicken Tandoori ($5.99): they only gave me 2 chicken legs but it was big, enough with the amount of rice that came with. Very very good tho, my bf and I really enjoyed it.     + Samosas (3 for $2.99): Samosa was huge and spicy, came with 2 sauces. My bf loves the samosas here but I think it was too spicy for my taste and a bit oily, but I have to say the flavour was very good tho.      + Side - Peas and potatos curry: I thougt it was ok, nothing specal. If I order a curry dish, I wouldn't want a curry vegetable to go with it because it would be too much curry for me.      + Side - Spinach and potatoes or cheese: really really enjoy this vegetable side. I would say it's the best out of all their vegetables they offer. Flavour was very well balanced and creamy. - Portion: generous, will definitely make you full with only one combo - Price: Cheap, all are under $10 and very nutritious as well.  - Great customer service - If you are student, show your student card to redeem a free naan. Their naan is fresh made and very very good."}
{"text":"It's obviously not an upscale place, so there will be complaints.... but all in all I love the price ($6 plus tax for a pretty big box full of food), rich taste, not too oily (huge plus when it comes to Indian/Pakistani food, where everything usually swims in grease), lovely flavour, and a lot of classic yummy veggie dishes that you can't always find (shahi paneer), very friendly service. My only qualm would be that they added way too much rice..."}
{"text":"Looks good on paper, but the place has SERIOUS consistency and food handling problems. DO NOT APPROACH!  You ask them for \"mild\", they still give you SUPER FUCKING HOT biryani. It's like there's only one pot of Biryani they got in the back, but they kind of mess with your head and ask you \"mild, medium or hot?\" and then also go through the motions of mumbling something to the back room staff.  The naan used to be good, but the guy left. Now, there a few 'experts' who'd be happy to give you a weirdly spread piece of barely cooked dough and gladly charge you 1.50$ for it.   There is ZERO consistency when it comes to spices and salt. pretty much every item is super salty! SUPER. SALTY! It's like the staff has not tastebuds for salt! You could kill a rat with that kind of saltiness, and I think that's how they protect their food from downtown rodents. SALT baby!  Now the piece du resistance. They do not give a fu*k about maintaining proper temperature for meat. How do I know this, I got a chicken biryani and as soon as I got near the piece of chicken, it smelled like a rotten squirrel! It was rotten! but the brave crew cooked it anyway and the heroic frontdesk staff not only sold it to me with a straight face, they charged me 5 bucks for a cup of super salty (not to mention oily) rice and a piece of chicken that had gone rotten.  Do you not smell the meat before you cook it? Are you aware that if meat, especially chicken is not kept at a cool temperature it will rot and can cause serious problems for people who eat it?  In short. Do you give a F**K?   I know I don't and after having written this review, I have realized that 2 stars are one too many. So I'm reducing my rating to 1 start. That vietnamese chick is right. this place deserves negative stars (as of late at least.)"}
{"text":"I live in the states and do not have access to high-quality Indian cuisine. Although Curry & Co. is more of a fast-food version, it beats most of the restaurants I have tried in my state of Minnesota. This place is located inside the 10 Dundas East shopping mall and offers Halal food with high-portions and at an affordable price (think $6 USD for a large meal)  I ordered the delicious lamb curry, with hot and fresh biryani rice and a topping of spinach (5/5)   - One of the best fast food meals I have had. It actually is fairly healthy and is on the same level as a restaurant competitor. The spinach was hot and melted with the rice to provide an aroma that is unbeatable. The lamb was tender and probably simmered for several hours before served  Curry & Co. is amazing and gets the job done for those longing for this cuisine!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the cafeteria of Dundas square. It is a home run kitchen makes genuinely good food. Very generous and hospitable, they would like you to try a sample before making your decision. The curry dishes are burst with flavors, specialized in meat dishes. Very generous with the portion size and cater for special request. The chef's daily special is always a pleasant surprise, cashew nut chicken and fish are my favorite.  Don't forget to try the spiced rice and home made hot sauce it's a winer."}
{"text":"Didn't taste that good.. Watery mess.. Meat quality on the lamb that I got wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Aaloo mattar (peas and potato curry) with naan, chicken curry, and chicken kabob were delicious!  The tuesday special chicken biryani with butter chicken and mango lassi is of great flavour and quality!"}
{"text":"Wow. Run, don't walk, to this place.  I usually avoid food court restaurants like the plague, especially around tourist traps like Yonge-Dundas square. But this hidden gem is the real deal. Incredibly delicious and complex Indian food at an amazingly reasonable price point. For $7.50 (!!!!!) I got a heaped serving of tender, rich, spicy yet flavoursome lamb curry, a side of delicious spinach and potato (it's not listed on the menu, but you get a veggie side with every order of a meat curry - such good value!) and a piping hot, soft and fluffy naan baked fresh in an actual real-deal tandoor (oven) that they have managed to set up in their tiny space. Service was fast and super friendly and ready to please.   Seriously, this is some of the best Indian food I have eaten in Toronto. My mother and father ran an Indian restaurant when I was a baby and I was nourished on chicken Madras while I was in utero so I like to think I know what I'm saying when I say... this is the real deal. Get to it to people!  As others have said it is hard to find: it's on the third floor of the Cineplex complex at Yonge and Dundas (on the north east side) and it's kind of hidden away in a corner near the bathrooms. If you are coming out of a movie you will see it immediately on your left as you enter the food court. Remember not to fill up on popcorn, because Curry and Co is the real treat! (Note for parents: kids love the mango lassi)."}
{"text":"If you served me their food on a nice plate and in a fancy restaurant, I'd totally believe it.   We ordered their nihari + naan + biriyani (with chicken (we ordered this because of a previous yelp review)). Omg their nihari was a thing of dreams. Meat so soft and tender, fell apart easily with a fork. The chicken in the biriyani was juicy and flavourful. Their naan was fresh and delicious. The sauces that came with the food were tasty also. Seriously some of the tastiest food I've ever eaten, and so inexpensively and at a food court. So unsuspecting. But everything was tasty and you could tell that a lot of time went into the prep.  Also bought 3 samosas. They were a perfect balance of crispy on the outside but moist and flavourful on the inside. The 2 sauces that come with it were very tasty.    2 of us ate dinner, and brought left overs home for 16$. Great value.  Highly recommend! It's like eating high quality food at decent lunch prices!  Also I'm unsure how other reviewers called this place hard to find... there are maybe 10-15 shops that surround the seating area. This restaurant has good signage and was easy to spot."}
{"text":"I was on the way to theater and then just explored the place.i was expecting the food here to follow in the food court pattern  but was pleased to find the menus trending in a contemporary direction with emphasis on  fresh and organic fare . My favorite dish at this place  was chicken biryani  and butter chicken thats what i tried.they have different spice levels for biryani and it was actualy so delicious made with freshly ground spices and loaded with organic green chillies and chicken. V ordered three meals one spicy chicken biryani big size and a mild chicken biryani with a butter chicken combo for our 10 years old kid.v finished our big size spicy biryani after some time because we could not resist eating faster, the taste was reminding me of hyderabad famous biryani,so we ordered the second one (big biryani) again though the portion was generous in both.our kid  enjoyed his meal so much it was mild biryani i was expecting it could be spicy for our kid but it was perfect mild for our kid and butter chicken added perfect flavour to it. The staff was so freindly Lovely lunch today.A very good experience! Add this to the best take out place ever in the city. Chicken biryani is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Service was average, it could have been better. I ordered the butter chicken with naan on the side and I was surprised that they make it fresh on the spot so it came out hot and crispy. The chicken was good and I ate it all in one go (even though it made me late to class haha)."}
