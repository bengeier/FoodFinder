{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place tonight after reading great reviews but are both extremly disappointed. we both ordered \"the works\" and had a side of fries. The sandwich was salty and  flavourless. The beef looked overcook, I could not even finish it. Before I mention the fries...As a background I have an unhealthy addiction to potatoes/fries. The fries were unbearable to eat,  soggy, over fried, much to say we threw out the entire container. I would rate this place 0/5 stars if I could. To top it off it was expensive! $26 To waste for two awful sandwiches and old fries."}
{"text":"Their sandwich \"the works\" (lot of cheddar cheese on the meat and mushroom sauce) is tasty and probably the best one I've ever had on Eglinton but the bread was a little too soggy. I'll probably try a different one next time. Unhealthy but good for the palate."}
{"text":"I made an order online and was unable to input my unit number so i called in to make sure the order went through and to give my unit and buzzer code.  I received the impression that the person taking the order wasnt happy to have to talk to me. Lacked customer service skills. When the delivery man arrived at my door he brought the credit card machine to charge me and said because it didnt charge online all while asking for tip as well. I paid the man with my credit card only to find out after he left that i had been double charged $31.76 by paying on-line and at the door. I called back to give the information and again the call taker was not happy and asked me what i wanted to do if i wanted \"store credit or what\"?  I said i want the charge reversed and he spoke incoherently and said ok and brushed me off the phone. I have no idea if he is going to reverse the charge or not.   As for the food the steak sandwich, burger and fries are all soggy soggy. Not happy at all....  UPDATE: A young man named Peter, who works during the day, rectified the issue and refunded me. He demonstrated what customer service is about and so I was reassured with his demeanour."}
{"text":"Not even close when it comes to where you can get the best cheesesteak sandwich... I Went to Philly is absolutely top class, from their service to the last bit of that sandwich. Honestly not enough amazing things can be said about this place, I NEED to come here at least once a week.  Always come here with a group of friends and they always manage to make every single sandwich to perfection. They also have an electronic jukebox which is an added bonus cause they got some amazing songs on it."}
{"text":"I've been to Philly and had amazing cheese steak.  This place at College and Yonge did not fulfill my expectations.  I ordered the chicken cheese steak and paid extra to have provolone instead of cheese whiz.  The cook made a mistake and put both cheese whiz and provolone on my sandwich.  i was like, no worries, i'll still eat it.  The cheese whiz over powered my cheese steak and i couldn't taste anything except the cheese whiz which was sooo salty.  The cheese steaks I had in Philly were WAY better and they were bigger sized as well for less the price i paid at this place at Yonge and College.  I highly doubt i'll be eating at this place again.  i'd rather take a trip back to Philly for the real deal."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter was so sweet it was my first time in the place he helped me with what to order ...... He gave me my food and he even gave me free French fries with my order.... I took 2 bites of my food what was good until I found a hair in my fries .... It was short and black just like the guys behind the counter I couldn't eat another bite ... He was so sweet I didn't want to say anything to him so I just threw away what was left ... The customer service was great too bad I wasn't able to say the same about the food.."}
{"text":"It took me a bit to get over the idea that Cheez Whiz is an ingredient, but I ordered the traditional with both Whiz and regular cheese, onions and mushrooms. Place wasn't busy, staff were friendly, food was decent and it didn't strike me as terribly expensive. My suggestion is, if you like steak-and-cheese fast food subs, give this a try, you'll like it more. On a side note, we sat there eating and looking out the window onto Yonge St. and watched a vegan parade go by."}
{"text":"I tried this place today after hearing about it from my husband who drove by it a couple days ago.  I am originally from Philly, and I have always missed a good Philly cheesesteak, but I no longer have to miss them, because they are authentic as getting one in Philly.  The meat was juicy, and lots of flavor, everything about it was delicious.  I will definitely be going back very soon!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Philly, but this is what I expect a traditional cheesesteak would be like. The loaded sandwich comes with an (un)healthy portion of meat and caramelized onions, in addition to the standrd cheez whiz topping. It's so greasy that you have to race to eat the sandwich before the bun disintigrates. Don't wear your finest clothes to eat this sloppy sandwich.  Protip: one order of fries is enough for a family, especially after consuming an entire cheesesteak. They're equally as delicious and greasy.  P.S. When you order a combo they give you a hot pepper with it. Yum."}
{"text":"Solid sandwich, the cheese whiz really does it for me. Guy working there was nice, threw in a couple sides free of charge. Would go back."}
{"text":"First time I went the food was good second  and third Time was disgusting I ordered a cheese fries and instead of what I was expecting I got a plate of fries with warm cheese whiz it was disgusting just went today to give their poutine and the gravy was old and lumpy like wtf have some standards the gravy must have been reheated from yesterday.  Not going back"}
{"text":"I walk by this place everyday and I had been meaning to try it after I received a free fries coupon with purchase of a sandwich or burger.  I almost didn't try this joint out after a guy giving out coupons outside the restaurant hit on me. I called to complain about how uncomfortable and inappropriate the incident was and it turned out that the guy was just a homeless guy who came in asking for work. They let him hand out the coupons because they felt sorry for him. Luckily, the manager won't let him work with them again. I was extremely relieved.  The staff working were nothing like that guy I encountered. They were friendly, patient, and not to mention much more well-groomed. The food itself was great. I am always on the lookout for good fries and I Went to Philly did not disappoint. I am so glad I had that free fries coupon. As for the sandwich, the main feature, it was also delicious. I ordered a chicken pizza sandwich. It was messy to eat, but I think all Philly sandwiches are.  Will I be back? As long as they don't let that pervert work for them again, then yes. I love their fries and their sandwiches."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was very pleased.  The taste was phenomenal and am definately going back to try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"Come on now.. It's hard to find a decent Philly Cheese Steak around here. That said, me and a couple of my friend found this little gem over the weekend.  We all got the work's obviously... The combo included a Philly Cheese Steak (orchicken) with cheese/cheese whiz, onions, peppers and just about anything you want on it. Oh and did i mention the fries comes with all those toppings as well? The meal was tied together with an awesome cherry pepper.  Food was great and the People were quite nice.. even at 4am when we showed up for round 2. I'm pretty sure it was on that show \"You gotta eat here\" at one point too.   A must go in you're in the Area... at least then you'll be able to say \"I Went to Philly\""}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place because I love diner type restaurants.   Their menu is awesome and a little out there. They mix a lot of sweet and salty foods. Everything is around 5$-10$.  I got the 'works' philly sandwich and my husband got chicken strips that were breaded with frosted flakes and served in a waffle cone with icing sugar. That was actually really good but it's very heavy and hard to finish.  My sandwich was disappointing :(. I was expecting so much more then bland meat on a cheap soggy cold bun drenched in cheese wiz.  Yes cheese wiz.   Apparently that's what a real philly cheese steak is supposed to be like but personally I hated it.   I do love the decor and pinball machine it's really cute.   Next time I'm trying out the hot dog wrapped in bacon."}
{"text":"Went to the new location in the Stockyards and extremely disappointed.  Waited 15min four our order and sandwich was a slopey mess. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Omg steak and bacon cheese burgers are to die for. Decoration is bad but food is good! I will come back."}
{"text":"I went to Philly and it was amazing!   First I ate 'the traditional' and half of the gf's 'the works.' They were the best philly steaks I've had in Toronto bar none.  After that, I felt like trying the cheeseburger; the homemade beef was delicious and the buns were soft, soaking up the grease to make each bite heavenly.  With all that salt + the hot pepper served with the meal, I was thirsty as heck so they just gave me a free drink! They're the best."}
{"text":"Great idea, nice menu, but incredibly salty.  We ordered the Philly Cheese, and the Philly Dog.  Both were too salty to really enjoy.  It's a shame because it could be so much better."}
{"text":"Great food, SUPER friendly service!! Always good during exam-cramming sessions :) very generous portions and the bread they use is so soft- meat cooked to perfection and huge servings of fries. Will have to try some of their unique drinks at some point too!!"}
{"text":"I went to Philly and all I got was an average sandwich.  The sandwich has all your Philly Cheesesteak basics: * shaved steak * provolone * cheese whiz * toasty bun  But I just didn't love my experience here.  Maybe it's watching the whiz being spooned onto your sandwich from a giant bucket. At the time, this place was cash only. Not sure if the gruff service is considered part of the Philly experience. The ordering instructions on the wall seemed cheesier than the whiz sauce. The sandwich just wasn't particularly flavorful or memorable.  And they are charging too much for this sandwich. ... But I do love cheese fries. I'll be back, this place is pretty convenient, even though I can't say I love their sandwiches.  Fine, I secretly love cheese whiz."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and have had the cheese steak 4 times now. That is all I go in for and that is what my rating is based on. The rest of the menu is just filler.  The sandwich is authentic ... Reminds me of the market in Philly. Seasoned well. Good bun. Don't anyone complain about the Cheeze Whiz as it is required for a proper sandwich. Staple since the 60's in Philly.  Here is unfortunately why the place won't last in my neighborhood.  1. What's the deal with the papier mache sign out front? Looks like a regurgitated sandwich. They should have kept the same simple signage like downtown.  2. Not inviting. The place doesn't look appealing.   3. Price. It's not a reasonably price sandwich for what you get. A couple of times they skimped on the meat.    4. Daily Special: Hasn't changed since the day they moved in. (Haven't checked in about a month though). Guess it is hard to have a daily special when you only serve 1 main item.   I hope they do well as the last thing we need in the neighborhood is another nail salon or massage parlor to take its place."}
{"text":"I personally am not a huge fan of I Went to Philly's, so this review is really based off on my fiance's side of things since he doesn't have a Yelp account.   I've been here numerous times and found this place by accident when my friends and I were driving around actually looking for another place.   My fiance is a hugeeee fan of their Philly Cheesesteaks here, and I'll admit it does look/smell good but subs/sandwiches aren't exactly my thing. He tells me it's even better when we call ahead and take the sandwich home since the meat juices and all those flavours just get absorbed by the bread making it even more delicious.  I did take one star off though based on my own review, but in all honesty, there's nothing here I really enjoy. I've tried quite a few things from their menu ranging from pizza fries, regular poutine, hamburgers and this other dish I can't seem to remember the name of. But it's two grilled cheese sandwiches acting as hamburger buns, with hamburger meat, a sausage and bacon in the middle. the flavour is always really eh to me and it's nothing to rave about. So I guess their cheesesteaks must actually be that good since it's all I see people order around here when we drop by.  It's not super packed in here, but I have seen some people in the place. The staff are always friendly but maybe it's because they remember our faces by now. The prices aren't the cheapest, but the portions are pretty frickin' huge so I guess it evens out.  I guess if you're looking for some really great Philly Cheesesteak, I would recommend I Went to Phillys!"}
{"text":"So I was out in Toronto last weekend when I Went To Philly! Confused? Don't be, it's just the creative name of one of the best after bar spots in the city: I Went To Philly! And what does one go to Philly for? Stupid questions rookie... you go for dat Philly Cheese with da Wizz! (Cheese Whizz that iz).   This is what people come for, traditional philly cheese-steak sandwiches done on foot long hoagie buns, tossed with peppers and onions and cheese and doused with healthy dollops of warm cheese whizz. I thought this would be gross but in actuality it was do good I'd almost call it gourmet!  The place is shabby looking, but I think that's what they're going for, It looks and feels just like a grimy sandwich shop anywhere else you'd go - so for me when a place is so focused on pumping out the food that they forget about the frills, that's a good sign in my book (oh that, and the out the door line up).  My only gripe was that they ran out of bread around the time we were ordering so only half of our group was able to get a full sandwich - I know sharing is caring and all but sharing a philly at 2am is like being asked to give up your 1st born. Better planning next time and you'll have yourself a 5th star from me!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in South Jersey, just outside of the City of Brotherly Love, I have to say this is the real deal.  Yum yum Yum...  Only disappointment was they were out of Tasty-Kakes but next time.  Those that talk about Greasy or cheese whiz over powering their \"Chicken Cheese Steak\"  get over it that is what a Philly Cheese steak is, cheesy greasy goodness and no one in Philly would be caught dead ordering a Chicken Cheese Steak\" in the first place. Having gone to many a Broad St Bullies game I found the Maple Leaf Coke Zero cans a little humourous, nevah in Philly.  Heard they maybe opening a second... I hope around Yonge and Eg. Loved it"}
{"text":"I love this place! I get it delivered and can only imagine that eating in is even better. But I LOVE it. This time I got the Philly Fry Dog, Lester's Hot Dogs are amaze balls and there was bacon and dog to the very last little bite. They called to let us know they were out of coleslaw but replaced it with a costlier deep fried Nutella sandwich! Who am I to argue fate? It was kismet and it was beautiful, le sigh. But I digress... Can I take a moment to express the joy I felt at discovering a treasure nestled lovingly in with my behemoth dog? It was a big, juicy, bright red, pickly pepper. Fantastic!  My sweet hunka hunka burnin' love ordered a cheeseburger and was disappointed with the level of cheesiness... Easily remedied with extra cheese next time around. And in a blindingly predictable turn MSHHBL also ordered the poutine; huge portion, nice savoury gravy and a very satisfying level of oozing cheesy goodness.  The ONLY reason this is not a 5 star review is the delivery time took a wee bit of patience this time around, but the first time it was fast and as such I have made the executive decision to consider this time to be a glitch and not the norm."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim as walking down Eglinton w. First impression upon arriving was that it reminded me of an old school burger joint that serves 'shakes'. Very charming. Even more charming was the adorable young lady at the cash register being coached by her dad in the back on how to use the POS system. When dad was busy in the back, my boyfriend paid for our meal and instructed the young lady on how much change to give back. I can't-too adorable! Anyhow, I got just the regular cheese steak; meat, cheese wiz, and fried onions. This is my first cheese steak...I really liked it! My boyfriend got the same thing but added bacon. He really enjoyed his too, though he couldn't really taste the bacon and actually forgot that it was supposed to be in there. We got one order of fries on the side, and the fries were good, but honestly the cheese steaks were very filling and did not need anything on the side in my opinion. Another review stated that the meat was dry/overcooked. Not the case for us. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. My boyfriend was really excited about the yoo-hoo chocolate drink, but one star is lost due to the high price of them (3 bucks). But then again, you can't find them in too many other places.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience and we will be back. The menu has some pretty epic looking desserts that I wouldn't mind trying, as well as many different types/variations of cheese steaks. That said, I will almost certainly only get the original one as I really, really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hey kids!  Please IGNORE any bad reviews below and forgive them, for they know not what they do! (Stares at Jenny and David). I am VERY fussy, with lots of restaurant and roadfood experience, I've visited here many times, and I'll give you the straight scoop. ;-)  This joint is legit! Great fries, clearly 100% fresh-cut on-site (stare), nicely browned, thinner cut 1/4\", not shoestring, and very similar to excellent old-school Swiss Chalet fries from the past.  For me, they are up there among the very best in the city!  Cheesesteaks are real-deal ribeye (not mystery meat - stare again) sliced thin and then spatula-chopped on the flat top grill while cooking, exactly as mandated by the philly gods.  'Wit' onions, real provolone, goopy whiz and a sweet-hot cherry pepper (don't ask for green peppers and look like a noob!) complete a near-perfect cheesesteak.  The ONLY reasons they dont get the full 5 stars from me are slightly more than acceptable amount of inconsistency on meat quantity and cooking from cook-to-cook (stick with Julie in the daytime if possible ;-) ) and their bread.  The bun is large, soft, and tasty, but just a HINT too soft - missing the slightly chewy outer crust necessary to safely avoid sandwich disintegration and deliver the 100% genuine crazy-for-their-bread Philadelphia experience.  That said, i am admittedly nit-picking - this place is GREAT, and will be seeing LOTS of my discretionary foodie dollars!"}
{"text":"O Dear G-D, its alot of food!  I've been here twice, once on a boy's night out and once with the lady. With the boys we all had the Works Sandwich plus I ordered the deep fried PB & J. Amazing but soo much food. I could barely walk after I finished. The sweet pepper was a nice touch.   When I went back with the lady we got the works, a drink plus cheesy fries with some meat and a Works sandwich for 13$. Good value but I could take or leave the Philiyfries (Canadians definitely have the edge with Poutine) but the Sandwich was still great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cheesesteak and friendly service. The original authentic American cheesesteak joint in Toronto, and certainly the best. Once this place opened, I never bought a footlong Steak and Cheese at Subway again.  Whiz wit or traditional wit (whiz + provolone) is the way to go, though you can't taste the provolone too much."}
{"text":"It's nothing special. Kinda expensive for what you get. Really loud inside from Jukebox. Won't be back, can find better P. Cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"I spent four years in Philly as an undergrad so I've had a lot of cheesesteaks. It's hard to find anything resembling a real cheesesteak outside of the PA-DE-NJ area, especially in Canada. This is the closest thing I've had outside of Philly, but it fell a little flat. The bread is a criminally underrated part of the cheesesteak. In Philly, most places use Amoroso rolls which are locally baked. I found the bread here a little too soft and sweet and the whole thing kind of melted into itself. The meat was alright, but just a little off. On its own it's a perfectly acceptable sandwich, but I wouldn't even put it in the same category as Pat's and Geno's, which themselves fall short of other Philly institutions.  I'll give it three stars because, like I said, it's an alright sandwich, maybe even great depending on your expectations (and I might be tinged by nostalgia). The guys behind the counter were nice. Fries were good. It's just not the same, though."}
{"text":"I went to Philly and created the wall of fame.  First of all, it should be mandated that every review of this place opens with \"I went to Philly ...\", so kudos to Chris P for doing just that.  Secondly, and as pompous as it may sound, if you've never had a greasy, salty, cheesy and delicious steak sandwich in Philadelphia AND you don't like I Went To Philly's for these very reasons, don't write a review. That's what it's all about.  I'm surprised that it took me 5 months to get here, but I finally did for lunch yesterday. I'd intended on grabbing a quick bite, but after one bite of The Traditional (whiz, provolone wit onions), I knew I'd be in for another. It was everything it should have been.  For my second, I decided to try The Works: whiz, provolone, onions, mushrooms and peppers. There must be more meat in there as well as it was significantly larger. It was good, but it was tough to pick out the extras in there beyond the mushrooms.   Because I'm a filthy animal, I was contemplating a third and when I mentioned it, Peter, one of the owner's sons working behind the counter, agreed with me that if I did, they'd take my picture and start a Wall of Fame/Shame.*  So I did.   And they did.   And they knocked off a couple of bucks to boot.   And #3 was just as good as the first.  Oh yeah, and the hot cherry pepper served with each is a burner and really tasty, so love it. And apparently there's a not-so-secret  menu a-la Burger's Priest/In & Out. That's reason enough to return.  If, like me, you've been longing for a Philly steak sammy that hits the mark, it's worth the trip to College Park. It's not cheap, but it's delicious and filling for a normal human.   * Wall of Fame/Shame to be constructed at time of this review."}
{"text":"Last night was our second time stopping for dinner at I Went To Philly. It was delicious, filling, great portions,  and  a clean, bright space. The staff is also very  friendly and attentive. A great addition to the area, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was here last week for the first time.  It wasn't too busy and the order came out quite quickly.    The only thing I guess I have an issue to is as much as this place wants to be like Philadelphia it comes pretty close as far as the Philly cheese steak goes.  That is all I had ordered, nothing extra no Yoohoo or Tasty Cakes etc.    The sandwich itself which is the traditional \"whiz wit\" is basically a good version although I found the steak to be chopped too fine.    I've been to 3 different places in Philly within a 2 day span and while the meat itself in the sandwich is sufficient, the total size of the sandwich is about 2/3 to half the size of what it should be.    That is the only issue I have would be the size of the sandwich vs what you would come to expect if you go to Philadelphia.  All 3 places I've been to in Philly were very different and this place has it's own style.    As far as authenticity I suppose it is the best Toronto has which isn't really that far off."}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!  the best cheesesteak eva!!!!!  So delicious, it was inhaled. Also tried chicken and waffles, chicken pieces incredible, the waffle... needs some work  This is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Went there and got take out, the sandwich wasn't as good then it cooled down, but recently went back and ate in, it was fantastic. I ordered the special, and since it was the end of the night, the cook (who was only supposed to top my fries with cheese sauce) topped them with a bunch of meat too.  The sandwich was great, lots of meat and cheese, and on a really good bun. The staff was all really friendly too, I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Something has changed here besides the location, maybe ownership, I don't know. I know this, the sandwich isn't is good as Yonge street was and the fries we had were completely different, undercooked not fried properly. I'm done."}
{"text":"I Went to Philly on Yonge and wow, it reminded me so much of my uni days.  I've never actually had a Philly cheese steak from Philadelphia before but I used to have them from the cafeteria at McMaster University over a decade ago.  It was greasy, unhealthy, heart attack worthy with something resembling meat, but oh so delicious.  I Went to Philly was similar except they used quality ingredients.  I got the Works which included sauteed mushrooms, onions, cheese whiz, spicy cherry peppers and quality meat on a soft bun.   I found the taste, the feel of the bun, the overall experience great as it brought back so many memories and the place itself to be fairly clean.    Verdict: Great greasy goodness."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Philly CheeseSteak and friendly service."}
{"text":"They aren't enough languages in the world to express my gratitude how delicious the steaks sandwiches are.  Explain to them what you want how you like it they will fix you right up. I enjoy  cheesesteaks also the honey chicken in the waffle cone the bomb.  I'm originally from the states but I do work in Montreal Canada and Toronto Ontario and I always make sure to go to Stop to this restaurant. I highly recommend great food"}
{"text":"I read about this place on blogto and decided to stop for lunch. The decor is 60s   burger shack/diner, but the flat screen TV throws it off. Stag was friendly and place was clean.   As for the sandwiched, OK. The meat was cooked right, but lacks taste. But once you add the fixings and a side of fries. You got yourself a decent meal.   I'll try a different sandwich the next time, may be I'll hear the violins :-)."}
{"text":"Last time I had an authentic philly cheese steak (or something as good) was almost 20 years ago in Philly!!! This place bought back memories... not sure if I ate it or swallowed it. I ordered the works and an hour later I'm debating if I should go back for dinner. Also, saw the fries and they looked freshly cut along with the hamburger I seen made from. Fresh ball of ground beef... I think I paid 9.50 total for my sandwich and it was totally worth it... To add fries and a drink I think it was two bucks more... You gotta try this if you like Philly cheese steaks or have been wondering what the Fresh Prince of BelAir was talking about!"}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just so I could leave a review of this place.  I went to Philadelphia in the fall and Cheese-steaks are all we could talk about for weeks upon return.  I went to Philly to get a Cheese-steak.  I was not disappointed.  Yes, it cost more than 5 bucks.  It is also not at the edge of civilization.  It is in Downtown TO.  Geno's Steaks in Philly (the original) cost more.   This place made me a Cheese-steak with rib-eye, and cheese-whiz, just like they make in Philly.  It was made to order and man, it did not disappoint.  It was good."}
{"text":"My first Philly Cheesesteak experience was a good one!  I have long wanted to try out the downtown location and was thrilled to learn there was a new location uptown. This spot is a bit hard to find due to poorly lit signage but your GPS should get you in the right vicinity.  I was tempted to go traditional but all the reviews I read from the downtown spot raved about 'The Works' so I tried that instead.   The meat was cooked well and was not fatty and the combination of cheeze whiz, pepper, mushrooms and onions was actually quite tasty (and I am not a mushroom or onion fan, so that is saying something!). The bun got a bit soggy by the end but I am sure that this would be the case if I was actually in Philly as well and I was happy with the food.   I stripped out the red pepper to place on the sandwich and it really added to the taste   I will be returning to let others try the 'uptown' location!"}
{"text":"Delivers as promised.  It was greasy, oily, cheesy, meaty, savoury, and delicious.  Ordered the daily special which was philly steak with onions and cheese wiz with a side of yukon cut fries.  They have a good number of variations to choose and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I actually went to Philly in November 2012 and had one of their Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches.  I didn't go to Tony Luke or Pat's which are the most well known but I did go to Jim's which judging by the celebrity endorsements and their prime location, ranks with the elite.  I believe that \"I Went to Philly\" opened up around that same time (late 2012) but I didn't get a chance to try it until last week.   The choices are a bit different than what they had a Jim's as they blend both the Cheese Whiz and Provolone together rather than having them as separate cheese choices. The sandwich was devoured quickly and the fries were quite good as well. In case you're wondering about the fries, they fall into the hand cut slightly soggy category which I do enjoy.  I didn't try any of their dessert items but I do plan to be back as the service was friendly. They also have a loyalty card where your ninth sandwich is free (or maybe tenth).  The prices are in the range of a Subway foot long (not when they have their $5 promotion) but they do have a great lunch combo deal where basically for a dollar more, you get fries and a soft drink. Speaking of drinks, this is the first time I had a Yoohoo.  I don't drink chocolate milk often but it is very similar but a bit more watered down. I actually like it better."}
{"text":"Ordered The Works and it was great. A friend who's been to Philadelphia confirmed its authenticity. I gotta say, this is pretty much the greasiest thing I've ever eaten but I couldn't get enough. Every bite of cheese whiz, shaved steak, provolone cheese, onions, and green peppers was to-die-for. I would definitely go back.   Tip: They also sell some American drinks, like Yoohoo."}
{"text":"My only criticism is they went a bit lighter on the whiz than I would have liked. Next time I'll ask for extra. There will be a next time because this place is the real deal!!  I've been to Philly many times and have been to Jim's,  pat's, genos, ishkabibbles... You name it. This place here in Toronto is in the upper echelon of cheesesteak greatness. The vibe of the place is cool too and the family who runs it are very sweet. Mega passionate about doing the cheesesteak properly. Well done!"}
{"text":"Ordered the works and philly salad .. what a mistake no utensils for salad and with no description when ordering it was no different from garden salad with French dressing .. there was no choice for dressing .. the sandwich was on not enough onions and green peppers .. asked for jalopenos and got zilch how disappointing .. oh well you win some and you lose some"}
{"text":"Nice little diner style restaurant that is self-serve. The philly sandwiches are pretty good, not the best I've had, but pretty good. Nothing really stands out about this place. Just your mediocre grab-n-go kind of place. Definitely worth trying once, but that is all."}
{"text":"Size of sandwich was alright but maybe I've just been a pig lately...the portions could be bigger!  It made me feel I could go home and be \"chef a la Mar\" and make more.  I had gotten the Philly cheese steak that comes with cheese wiz and onions, along with a steak and poutine steak fries. All was great and come to think about it, it would have probably been the cure for any drunk state / cure all hangover kinda meal. I even tried their \"yoohoo\" chocolate milk in a can which I didn't realize till after it wasn't real milk, but it was probably the best faux chocolate milk I've ever had. You might even be able to buy a case. I didn't bother since I couldn't  get over the fact it wasn't real milk!  Over all experience was great. The softest bun I ever had. Priced ok I would definitely go back but I'll load the topping or at least order double meat or extra cheese"}
{"text":"Solid place near College/Yonge. The interior has a retro thing going on - at least they're trying!  Sandwiches were HUGE and good. Make sure to get it with the onions and peppers. They overcooked the meat but it was still tasty. I think the sauce could've gone a little easier on the cheez wiz but that's just me. Gargantuan portion of fries, I would just get one to split between two. They also have Cotts Cherry Cola which made the meal even better.  All in all - a reasonably priced place near College and Yonge with HUGE portions. I can't speak to the quality of the cheesesteak since I'm not a connoisseur, but it was good enough. Also - CASH ONLY!  Would I return? Yea, if ever I am in the mood to eat an obscene amt of food."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Love the steak sandwiches and steak fries with wizz cheeze!"}
{"text":"Amazing Cheese Burger. Next time ill try the cheese Steak!"}
{"text":"You want Philly cheese steak the way it traditionally should be, you come here.  It is to drool for and tastes like more!"}
{"text":"Yelp works.. I walked past a handful of times; figured Toronto doesn't have decent Philly cheese steak.  I was wrong.  This beats GENOS and PATS in Philadelphia (for me).  Based on a better quality meat. Could really use a stronger decor and signage but a great find!  Loved it."}
{"text":"Really good cheese steaks i recommend traditional so good. Chicken in a waffle cone wicked chicken is breaded in frosted flakes with spicy sauce damn good. Watch out when delivery though they have this older guy who will complain about tips and even refuse to hand over food untill you give a better tip. He doesnt reflect the business though the owners are awesome people who will do thier best to make sure cusyomer is happy. But soo many bad experiences with delivery guy they need a new one quick."}
{"text":"My 3rd time coming here and I have to say, I am very addicted! The ambiance is nice and everything is super fresh. I came here to watch the game with my group of friends and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I have never actually been to Philly to have a Philly cheese steak from the source. I used to enjoy a Philly place in downtown Seattle. That's my metric. I've tried cheese steaks in Vegas and Toronto and have found them little more than meat on a bun. It got so bad, I took to making my own, with satisfying results. I've prided myself on the fact you won't get a better cheese steak in Toronto away from my dinner table.  I started seeing some good reviews and chatter about I Went to Philly, so I went to I Went to Philly fully prepared to hate going to I Went to Philly. But. I loved it. Better than even mine. Nice soft buns and melt-in-your-mouth shaved steak. I went with the classic which comes with both cheezwhiz and provolone (the legal cheeses) but I would argue go with the basic and select the cheezwhiz. The provolone (not a cheap cheese) isn't really that evident.  If you're here with two people, I'd suggest getting 1 order of fries. You get a box of fries the size of your average Philadelphian's ass.    Knocking them back a star for 1) price. You're out $13 bucks for a steak 'n' fries. 2) The Jesus shit on the wall. Preach to me about Cheesus, maybe. But Jesus? Pretty sure Jesus would not condone expensive lard ass food you're charging $13 for. Preach to me when you open a business based on the sermon on the mount.   Okay, that rant over, I'd have to say I enjoyed this meal about as much as a burger and fries at Five Guys and the wallet damage is the same. Think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak in GTA.  The meat is AA Rib Eye beef and the prices are very reasonable considering they are open until 4:00am plus delivery.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Having never actually been to Philly I can't vouch for the authenticity of these cheesesteakes.  What I can vouch for is their supreme deliciousness. I ordered mine with \"The Works\" (shaved steak, provolone, onions, mushrooms, green peppers, topped with cheese whiz) and DAMN BITCH, that's a tasty sang-wich! Slightly greasy, rather messy, and so good.  The friendly staff also offered us a free sample of their new creation...fried boneless chicken coated with crunchy frosted-flake breading smothered in sweet/spicy sauce. Awesome!  I'll be back to Philly, fo sho."}
{"text":"It's the best philly steak sandwich I've had I've been in the U.S. In many cities but this place is the bomb but don't take my word TRY IT FOR YOUR SELF"}
{"text":"So I must credit Johnny H \"Yelping Perfection\" for bringing this to my attention on Yelp Talk.  This casual, self-served, family-owned joint serves up classic Philly Cheese steaks.  As soon as I found out about this, I told another cheese steak lover and he could not wait another day to check it out.  Can't blame him since it's so hard to find a good one these days.   Walked into this relatively spacious (approx 30 seats) fast-food restaurant to be slightly overwhelmed by their menu.  It spread across the top from wall to wall, listing what seemed like endless possibilities.  But upon closer look, it gets confusing and it just all seemed to be the same steak sammy but with your choice of provolone, cheese whiz, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers.  All the prices might vary anywhere between 25 cents to maybe a buck and change (I can't be sure- too many numbers).  Do take note that \"WIT\" on the menu means 'with onions'... don't ask me.  I gave up trying to order from the menu and went straight to the counter staff and just told the helpful lady what I wanted.    Cheese Steak w Provolone, Cheese Whiz, Mushrooms, Onions: $8-9? (3/5 stars) The lady said the traditional way has cheese whiz oozing out so I figured i just go for it.  After all, one can never have too much cheese right?  I loved that the bun was a nice warm pillowy bun because I just don't like hard bread.  Flavouring of the steak was good, but it was almost too chopped up and lacked some texture.  I appreciate the tenderness but it definitely would have been better if it maintained the natural chewiness of the beef.  There was a generous amount of beef, mushrooms, and onions... just enough to make it messy when I bite into it.  A messy sandwich is always better!  However, the cheese whiz caused it to be a bit too salty.  Cheese Fries: $3? 4? 5? (2.5/5 stars) Advertised to be hand-cut fries.  The cheese is just melted cheese whiz, so I was kind of disappointed.  The fries were delicious though! Perfect thickness fried to golden, crispy perfection.  I forgot how much it was but I remember thinking it was definitely not worth the price.  Next time, I will get the poutine or just the fries alone.  Cheese Steak w Provolone, Mushrooms, Onions, and Pepper: $8-9 (3.5/5 stars) This was round 2 for take out.  I skipped the Whiz this time and added some juicy sweet green peppers instead.  It was much better.  Same soft bun, but less salty.  The pepper, mushrooms, and onions worked to counter the grease and salt.    Service: (4/5 stars) I suspect they are owners and family members of.  They were all very kind and friendly.  Patient and helpful.  I hope they keep it up!  I like this place.  Conveniently located at Yonge and College, I expect them to satisfy quite a few cheese steak cravings.  I did forget their hours of operations though.  I will be back some time."}
{"text":"If there is something that i hate from restaurants is when they prefer to save money on ingredients than bring you a quality product, they claim they use cheez whiz for everything but im sorry you guys are either mixing with something else or is something entirely different, the quality of the buns is not the same that it used to be, staff is friendly and i have been a client of this place every week religiously for over 4 years but im seriously thinking in not coming back here. Fix it!!"}
{"text":"Was pissed when I ordered and it took almost an hour and a half - they explained it was due to a power outage which makes sense because it was almost 40 degrees out today. Felt bad about only tipping 10% due to the late service because the food was friggin awesome! Bloomin onion was bomb - def. recommend! I had the philly pizza sub - wife had traditional Philly cheese steak - both thoroughly enjoyed. Will order again."}
{"text":"Ordered the works steak and cheese  Asked for no cheese wiz, the food was really really dry and the meat was way over cooked . We also ordered the garden salad with steak , the steak poutine and the deep fried Nutella . The salad came with no dressing again the meat over cooked the poutine was really dry as well not enough Garvey . And the Nutella sandwich was meh !!  Don't recommend this place is you want a really good Philly cheese steak sandwich !"}
{"text":"Great food, i've ordered twice from tasteaway. Arrived on time, the food was good, could use a litte more cheese, but won't take a star off for it. I've ordered the philly cheese steaks, and bacon poutines. Would order more often, enjoyable food.  For the people reviewing under cooked fries - line cooks get paid $11-$15/hr, and sometimes it's their first day on the job, hard to believe I know, a professional might not always be making your fries!"}
{"text":"It's a cool and interesting joint, but one look at their menu and you know it's a place that can send your diet plans plummeting: steaks, provolone, cheese whiz, poutine, deep fried PB&J and Nutella sandwiches-- what? I ordered \"the works\" philly cheesesteak sandwich which was nice and tasty. The little red chill pepper that came with it added a nice touch. I haven't been to Philadelphia and this was my first philly cheesesteak. I would say it's the Americanized version of bahn mi, just with a whole lot more meat and minus the veggies. My only issue was, as I waited for my sandwich and curiously watched the cook flipping the stuff on the stove, I saw him hold my bread with his bare hands to put in the meat and cheese. I would like to think he keeps his hands clean but really, I would feel much better if he used disposable plastic gloves. The table was also a bit greasy and sticky. Oh well, I guess it's all part of the whole \"I Went to Philly\" experience."}
{"text":"You've got to check this place out! Their Philly steak sandwiches are mouthwatering with plenty of meat to satisfy your craving. It doesn't get any better that this. If you're in the area, you owe yourself a visit to \"I Went To Philly\"."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are visiting from L.A. When I found out about this place I knew I had to try it. Pretty darn tasty! I've tasted a real Philly cheesesteak from Philly before and this place is almost like it. The cheese wiz makes it even better! I ordered the works cheesesteak and the cheese wiz made all the difference on that sandwich. Super old place but the food is definitely worth a try. I will be back for more before I leave Toronto. Great location in downtown and Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I went to Philly and I had a heart attack.  There is so much salt in their food it's borderline suicidal. But that being said, it's pretty gosh darn delicious. So much so that when my girlfriend was visiting from Calgary I took her here. No not for some romantic date, but for the sheer gluttony.  The portions are huge and you can easily share both a sandwich and fries. But what's the fun in that? On my first trip I got the special all to myself. On my second trip I got the special again but shared the fries because that's the polite thing to do, I guess. She got her own sandwich though. This isn't Communist Russia after all.  You absolutely can't go wrong with meat and onions drowning in cheese. I dare you to prove me wrong."}
{"text":"I have been to Philly and their sandwich is comparable to those found in Philadelphia.   Here is how I'd rate them:  Quality - 4 Quantity - 2 Price - 2  I work in an office building very close to this location, my colleagues and I were excited to see it opening up.  But after going, we all seem to agree while it taste good, it's not worth the cost for a quick lunch. You are looking at over $9.00 for a basic sandwich.  I went there when they first opened up. I noticed some of the pictures on the site look better then the one I received?"}
{"text":"I went here last night while on a business trip in Toronto. Small place, certainly feels like some of the cheesesteak locations in Philadelphia. I got a steak wit (Beef ribeye steak, grilled onions, provolone, and Cheez Whiz) and a can of soda for $10. Not cheap, but not ridiculous either. The sandwich was cooked to order of course, and was ready in less than 5 minutes. There was a sizable amount of meat and the sandwich was probably around 10 inches or so long. The meat was hot and juicy and the Cheez Whiz was Cheez Whiz. I usually prefer just straight American cheese on my steaks but the Whiz is ok and they definitely use it at the restaurants in Philly. The bread was fresh and soft, and that's really my only complaint. The bread tasted good, but I prefer a more chewy roll that will stand up to all the juicy meat inside. If you've ever been to Tony Lukes in Philly then you'll know what I mean, its what I judge every other cheesesteak against. All in all, it was a good meal and I'm glad I went."}
