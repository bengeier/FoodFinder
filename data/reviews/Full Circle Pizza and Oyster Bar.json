{"text":"Where's the owner?  I came in for some dinner on Tuesday. It happened to be their Buck-a-Shuck promotion. But I'm not much for oysters. I sat at the Bar and had a menu placed in front of me relatively promptly by one of the two guys working behind the bar, who appeared to be the only employees working.  Some friends of the bartenders who were also at the bar gave me some recommendations on their favorite pizzas. I picked one that sounded interesting and sat back an enjoyed my  soda water. The two guys behind the bar were working hard turning out drinks and Oysters (why the Oyster station is at the bar and not in a sanitary controlled environment in the kitchen was not evident, but they looked to be using the Ice station for the Oysters) but there was precious little activity elsewhere.  I kept my faith up, nonetheless.  After 20-25 minutes, one of the \"friends\" who had been drinking at the bar, came back inside from a smoke break, and one of the others said he was going to start making my Pizza. I looked back at the pizza oven and he was ripping off roughly 3 feet of tickets. At that point I gave up and left.  I can't fault the two bartenders who were trying to keep turning out drinks and Oysters, but what kind of owner leaves his or her restaurant with no GM and only two staff, especially on a promotional night like Buck-a-Shuck? Don't know if it's been the same owner through the previous two iterations of the place, but if this is how they run their business, it's no wonder it keeps shutting down. It's a shame, I used to like Bensonhurst, but I doubt I'll bother giving this place another shot despite its convenience to me.  Pros: Menu and a Glass of water were provided to me quickly Bartender appeared to know the menu Got me a Soda water very quickly when I asked for it.  Cons: -No owner or manager on site -Couldn't try food as my order wasn't made. -Unsure if Bartenders' friends drinking at the bar were employees or not. If they were, they were drinking rather than working. -Very understaffed if only two people working on Buck-a-Shuck night. -Oyster Station at the Bar seems unsanitary. -Unsure if Bartender rang in order. -No evident pride in the business."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, and open late! As an oyster lover, this is a great place to go when you need an oyster fix with friends who don't like oysters. They can get the equally good pizza."}
{"text":"Food, 3.5-4; Service, 1. Hence the 2 star rating. We recently visited for the second time (our first visit being in late 2015 when they first opened and clearly had some kinks to work out). Our drink order was taken fairly quickly (within just under 10 minutes... okay, maybe that was a sign!), drinks were served, our remaining order was taken (some oysters and a pizza - that's it) and off we go. Then came the wait. Oysters came in decent time thanks to the guy shucking them, but then our total visit lasted over 2.5 hours all in - including a volunteered admission from there runner that the pizza order was \"lost\" and someone \"accidentally tore up the receipt\" along with absolutely no further concern nor apology (maybe cover the second round of drinks that took an hour to refill as it was?). A $100 bill later with no regard for this blatant lack of customer service by our main waitress, and I have to admit I was stunned. I have never, to this point, been driven to write up a concern about any restaurant or hotel - good or bad - but this was beyond disappointing. The second round of drinks included a dirty martini (one that came after I watched them dump the first one for making it wrong) - one that was so sweet that I might have been drinking a cosmopolitan. How is it possible to mess that drink up? I'd love to support local business, but this is one case where such a sour taste was left in my mouth I just cannot bring myself to return."}
{"text":"My review is regarding the food I ordered, as opposed to giving 2 stars for the service.  First,  despite being left at the front door waiting for a while before being acknowledged, the service was decent. We had an efficient server and the gentleman who set our table chatted with us a bit before leaving and was very kind. My friend and I ordered the fries for a starter. They are triple fried and were served with a dip reminiscent of cheez whiz ( but better quality). Definitely delicious. Our meal here sort of fell apart when we ordered our pizzas, the Dr. octopi and the Californian.  Dr Octo-Pi obviously had octopus, seaweed, bonito flakes and corn.  It had generous toppings, but tasted waaaay too fishy. For my palate the dish had too much saltiness due to the ingredients. The Californian was a joke. The smoked salmon tasted terrible, or the few slivers there smattered half hazzardly on the pizza. There were random melting chunks of mascarpone and almost nothing else. We only had a piece each before boxing it up to take away. Why did we box it up? ( hate waste, boyfriend will eat anything)  The next day, even he wouldn't eat the leftovers. I can honestly say that I have never throw away left over pizza in my life, until now. Anywho, the restaurant was very busy and maybe there are other items on the menu that shine. According to the  other reviews, people truly enjoy their experience here.  Hoping mine was a one off. I read that two former employees of Sugo opened the place and I always try to support smaller businesses hoping they can stick around for the long term."}
{"text":"We LOVED it here! I was so pleasantly surprised. I went for the first time last night and was just hoping for decent pizza on a Friday night and I got A LOT more than that. Amazing cocktails, fantastic service and the best pizza I've had in the city. They have a lightly breaded calamari that's not on the regular menu, but it's a MUST if it's available - I woke up craving it. You can't find calamari like this anywhere in the city. The Fun Guy Pi is one of their most popular pizzas for good reason. There is something about their pizza dough and the perfectly baked thin crust that I will definitely be going back for. Their cocktails are next level - try the Smoked Old Fashioned even if you don't love bourbon. Great selection of local beer and awesome service. (Thank you Chode!)"}
{"text":"I've been to Full Circle Pizza and Oyster Bar a couple of times now. I love that the restaurant is bright and sunny in the front section while being cozy and private nearer the back. Of course, I like the sunny side so I always sit in the front. I've always had great service but then again, I always end up visiting during non regular hours, like in the middle of the afternoon. The servers and owners are friendly and welcoming. The pizzas are unique and tasty. So far we've tried the Fun Guy Pi (because I LOVE mushroom pizzas!) the Pea Ti Pi  (who doesn't like ham & peas?!), the Vegan Pi because...my daughter adores it, and the Reuben Pi with sauerkraut and house smoked brisket. Other menu items I've tried are fresh oysters, arancini, and mixed seafood stew. I thought they were all quite tasty, fresh, well prepared, etc. although my dad seemed to think the tomato stew was too 'tomato-y'. Not sure that was the dish he should have ordered as he's not a fan off cooked tomatoes. Anyway...as you can see I'm a fan! This is a great place to go for a decent pizza and late night oysters on 17th."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and it was amazing. Tried the warm olives with fried, delicious bread. Both the BLT and smoked char bennies were fantastic. Highly recommend trying the yummy cocktails too (Summer Somewhere Sangria) In a neighbourhood full of dining options, this is an awesome choice."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Love the drinks! Absoulutely loved the food; we had the Carpaccio Pizza, shared the Mussels and a Gnocchi! Delicious and full of flavour! My favourite drink was the Smoked Old Fashion, made by  gorgious bartender, Josh! He smoked the glass and even the water in the ice cubes! The Carpaccio was a highlight for the beef still was red rare and topped with mustard, balsamic, eggyolk and a delicious arugala salad! The mussels were to die for; you cant go wrong with a spicy tomato broth! Next time I will be back to try some oysters and many other exciting options. Keep doing what your doing guys! I definetly recomend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I was stuffed up & sick the one and only time I've been here. Probably not ideal when I'm trying a new place or on a date hey?  We figured we'd go with that this place is known for and got a half dozen oysters (the types slipped my memory) and the Dr.Octo-pi and Puttanesca-pi pizzas to share.  I think the novelty of bonito flakes lured me to the Dr.Octopi, because I have no idea why I thought an octopus/Japanese inspired pizza would taste good. And I don't love tuna, I think I was being polite and let my date order the other pizza. Even with my reduced sense of smell and taste, I didn't love either one. I maybe had a slice of each and we didn't bother to box up the rest.  I'd like to go back and take advantage of their happy hour for oysters. That seems to be the thing people are giving two thumbs up for here and they have a wide variety to choose from."}
{"text":"My 1st time at Full Circle was unfortunate, to put it mildly! But since Yelp loves this place I found myself wanting to go back. I'm glad I listened to yelp. ;p This place is pretty damn good!  The 1st time I was here was on Pi day (March 14) get it? hehehe ;p Full circle was hosting a free pizza, pizza party. So of course I stopped by. Unfortunately they weren't organized enough or prepared enough for the masses of excited people! There was a really, really, really long wait at the door and when you got to the front of the line they couldn't tell you anything; no wait time or explanation about the event. Just lots of people standing around being confused, and lots of staff standing around also confused. I did eventually get a slice of free pizza as promised, but even though the pizza was delicious, the ordeal of the \"party\" pretty much sucked all the positives away! :(  On my latest visit it was a totally different experience! No chaos, very orderly, good service! Definitely a relief, otherwise I'd be really worried about this place, since I went on a regular Saturday and all.  The tails of \"buck-a-shuck\" drew me back. It's not entirely $1 per oyster for all oysters, it's actually $2 off all their oysters. So, the regular lowest cost $3 ones turns into $1 each, but their more expensive oysters cost a little more than a buck a piece. It's still a fantastic deal though. I highly, highly recommend going if you like oysters!!  I also go a pie, of course! :) They have quite a few appealing choices but I settled on the Beef Carpaccio Pizza. It's exceptionally good!!! The crust is crispy and thin. Not super thin but a good, hand tossed kinda thin. It's very well cooked, not burnt, wasn't soggy in the centre, it's just a good crust all around! They also didn't skimp on the beef. This pie is literally shingled over with beef! There's a nice bit of mustard on each slice, as well as a pile of arugula salad in the centre so you can customize your slice to taste. Oh, and the hot chilli oil comes with the pizza no need to ask! ;)  I find the best tasting slice (personally) is to spread the entire dollop of mustard evenly over the whole slice of pizza, lightly drizzle some hot oil over the wedge and top it off with a single layer of fresh arugula. This gives a great balanced bite! I'm sure you already know that mustard and beef go well together. *cough* hot dogs and mustard *cough* The heat/tang from the mustard brings out more meaty flavour! (Seriously, it's science!) The arugula adds a nice bit of freshness and since I like spicy, the chilli oil punches it up just a bit.  Ok maybe your screen has gone dark once or twice already reading my long ass review but one more quick recommendation: Get a cocktail from this place! Any cocktail!  I got to try their smokey old fashioned and that was delicious! No joke on the smokiness but the taste is not purely charred wood. The walnut bitters work super well with the smoke and whisky, it's delicious. I also had the Paper Plane, a beautiful cocktail, that's also very, very tasty. You pretty much can't go wrong with a cocktail here!   In summary: Maybe skip celebrating Pi day at Full Circle... They're not the best at open invite free pizza parties yet. Definitely go any other time, especially 2 hours before they close for buck-a-shuck oysters! It's not $1 for all oysters but they are all discounted so it's still a great deal! Don't miss out on their pizzas! Loved the Beef Carpaccio! Have some cocktails too! Their bar game is strong!  Cheers & Enjoy"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon to test it out . It covered 2 drinks under $13 and a pizza under $22. The old fashion is $14, so we were just charged $1 for the difference.  Decided to get the beef carpaccio as we really love arugula on our pizza, and who doesn't love meat? It was yummy, although I wish there was more arugula. Obviously that's just my quirk and not a dealbreaker. It's a thin crust, but would hold the weight of the toppings and never got soggy.  We didn't get dessert as we were tipsy from the drinks, so we had to walk it off and wait in line at Made by Marcus to sober up. Yeah, the drinks are strong here as others have mentioned.  Sunday at 6:30pm is a great time to visit. There are plenty of tables available, and also plenty of free street parking outside. I wish we could take this place to Ann Arbor with us."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and I wasn't disappointed.  We did a round on their varieties of oysters and were given an extra smoked oyster for the hell of it.  Both the fun gi pi and the pi day pizzas were great as was the service. We didn't find the strawberry dessert pizza to be anything special, but was fun for a pizza themed night. All and all its a little pricey for a za, but a nice upscale twist to your regular thin crusts on 17th."}
{"text":"We've tried this place for dinner and brunch, both were excellent.  I agree with another reviewer who marvelled (with heartbreak) at how empty it was at brunch!  This place should be packed for brunch.  All of the dishes were absolutely delicious, there is nice variety on the menu, and the prices are reasonable.  Service is friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is fun and cozy, and again, the food is top notch.  Fresh, high quality ingredients, just about everything made in-house.  The complementary mini cinnamon buns are a nice (and incredibly yummy) touch!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and really great atmosphere greet you as soon as you enter this \"new\" restaurant.   Formerly Bensonhurst Pizza, the space has been updated with new colours and the Pi symbol on the brick wood fired pizza oven. Full Circle Pizza & Oyster Bar is a great addition to an already fantastic array of pizza pie choices around the 17th Avenue area.  Our meal... We had a Groupon for 4 drinks and 2 pizzas  So started with a Caesar Cocktail that doubles as an appetizer. Our son ordered the Homemade Iced Tea and my hubby a local brew. For starters, I ordered just a few East Coast oysters to test the presentation and taste. The half shells are served on top of plates filled with rocks. They come with a simple vinaigrette and lemons. I enjoyed each one that was suggested to me based on my taste preferences.  We ordered The Fun Guy (A play on Fungi) exotic mushroom pizza with Prosciutto, Tarragon Penna and Arugula.  Our second pizza was The Ruben Pi -House Smoked Brisket, Gibson's Rye, Sauerkraut, Mustard and Fruilano. This pizza is way up there in flavour and in my opinion rivals the deconstructed Rueben at Sugo Caffe Italia on 9th Ave SE.    Coffee & Dessert a bit of a disappointment (unfortunately had to take off a star for that.)  I can't wait to either use a Yelp check-in special or another Groupon next time I go back."}
{"text":"Amazing space, killer oysters and interesting pizzas! The owner and staff are very accommodating. We really liked our experience here and highly recommend! The late-night buck shuck is a good deal but prices are fair regardless. You absolutely must try the Applewood smoked raw oyster. Can't wait to go back and check out the rest of their deep menu!!"}
{"text":"I took advantage of the current Travelzoo deal which for $29, you get an appetizer, a pizza and two cocktails - seems like too good of a deal to pass! They also have a current lunch deal where $24 can get you a pizza + drink.  Hubby and I made lunch reservations to come here a few days ago and the restaurant was very empty but service was attentive and excellent during our entire stay.  I decided that one appetizer was not enough (I think most people order more than what the voucher allocates for and that's probably what the restaurants want anyway) so we got the oyster & beef tartare, deep fried oysters, California Pi and two cocktails to share.  Let me commend the restaurant for being extremely lenient with the voucher.  If your item is more than the limit, they just charge you the difference.  I've had experiences in the past where this was not allowed.  The tartare and the fried oysters were really good.  I love how fresh tasting and flavorful they were.  As I don't normally get fish on my pizza, I decided to try their house smoked trout which is on their California Pi.  The pizza here is different than your usual fare - the dough is thin, crispy and baked first and then the ingredients are added on after.  I felt like I was eating a healthy flatbread which I didn't mind at all.  We were modestly full after all that food (ok well, I wanted to try the ice cream from Made by Marcus down the block) but I would love to get their buttermilk panna cotta next time! I do however have to take a star off for cleanliness... we sat next to the window and there were dead flies and strands of hair on on the window sill and on the vent.  That's definitely a bit of a turn off for me but it's nothing a thorough wipe can't fix.  Anyhow, do come for the excellent food and service, as I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Following its predecessor,  the pizza is still great, albeit the menu is a bit pricey.   Dropped by for brunch with a Groupon, as we've been avoiding this place due to the price and heavy fish presence on the menu. For the Groupon, we got two brunch items and 2 cocktails, which was a great value compared to menu prices.  The restaurant was near-empty an hour after open on the weekend. The staff was very friendly and efficient, and did a good job of explaining the menu to us. I opted for a breakfast version of one of their regular pizzas, and we also got an eggs Benedict.   The cocktails were strong but delicious, and the food looked too good not to eat -hence the lack of photos. The portions were good too, as I wasn't able to finish the personal pizza alone.   The impression here was good enough to make me want to return for dinner some night, bit the prices are still prohibitive unless you aren't planning on drinking."}
{"text":"OYSTERS! OYSTERS! OYSTERS! Get your bum down to Full Circle and try the BEST DEEP-FRIED OYSTERS IN #YYC. Presented on a half shell, each plump morsel is cooked just so - kinda like a poached egg. The result? Fresh and light, tasting of the sea. Fried perfectly, with a crack like cream sauce underneath.   Yes, the pizzas, pastas, appetizers and everything I have tried is delicious. Try a cocktail. Strong and made with the good stuff."}
{"text":"What a great lunch!  Us three ladies shared the Flaming Moe's pizza, the Fromage a Trois (appy) and the Arancini (appy).  Everything was terrific!!"}
{"text":"I have to say the décor is nice - the jazz music playing in the back ground we enjoyed - I am quite positive that with some tweaking the menu will be great !!"}
{"text":"We tried the Hawaiian and the Rueben pizza, Hawaiian was good, ingredients were clearly fresh and tasty, the crust was slightly charred and perfectly chewy. However, it was the Rueben that really stood out the flavours were awesome and topped with sauerkraut it was perfect, not the typical pizza to try if you're just craving pizza but definitely a memorable flavour profile."}
{"text":"Whoever came up with the idea to pair oysters and pizza in the same meal, please identify yourself. You're my hero! You're also really bad for enabling my oyster obsession!!! Fun fact about me: I can easily consume 4 dozen oysters in one meal.   As famous food writer M.F.K Fisher once said, \"The flavor of an oyster depends upon several things. First, if it is fresh and sweet and healthy it will taste good, quite simply....good, that is, if the taster likes oysters.\" The oysters at Full Circle have all of the above qualities and seasonal east and west coast options are available. If you can, get west coast oysters like Hollie Wood, Saw Mill and/or Satori. If you don't like oysters, I can't say Full Circle will win you over even though it's a brilliant place to start. One girl at the table next to us was so squeamish, she chased hers with her drink and, I quote, \"had enough oysters for a lifetime.\" My poor oyster loving heart nearly broke when she gagged. And that brings us to the pizza options for the non-oyster lovers.   The pizza is amazing, but do try their wild flavors. We tried traditional flavors the first time and had the Coppa Cabana (Hawaiian) and Fun Guy Pi (mushroom), which were good, but the Beef Carpaccio on the second visit was a huge blast of flavor!! The crust is soft and perfectly cooked. The jalapeño oil served on the side is mildly spicy, and brings an already delicious pizza pie to a whole new level.   I've tried a few other menu items like their salads and other hot dishes but the pizza and oysters always brings me back. The service is great and friendly. On your next visit to Full Circle, look out for the girl with 4 dozen oysters in front of her because Full Circle is now my go-to whenever I get a hankering for oysters, with pizza on the side."}
{"text":"First star: Quite a few oyster selections on the menu, which definitely makes this restaurant stands out miles ahead of their competitors in Calgary!  Second star: Oysters are absolutely fresh and juicy! Not like those from competitors, they really taste fresh from the ocean.  Third star: the gentleman who served our table was very knowledgeable to explain all different types of oysters  Two other stars missing: 1. The flaming moe I ordered wasn't as exceptional as the oysters. The spicy flavor trumped all other ingredients on the dough. I'd rate it \"OK\". 2. I don't think pizza/beer and oysters/wine are good pairings..."}
{"text":"I am so sad about this place closing permanently. I was there at least twice a month and it really pains me that they could not keep their doors open. They had easily the best brunch and pizza in town for sure, excellent service and at super reasonable prices. Sad, sad, sad :(. I do for sure hope that the owners open up another restaurant soon."}
{"text":"A group of us ordered 3 different pizza pies and split them, which was a great way to try all the best sounding ones. Even the vegetarian loved hers."}
{"text":"Perhaps we had an 'off' experience but Full Circle was probably closer to 2.5 for me.   The place was empty but seemed decent enough. The person waiting tables was so friendly and greeted us right away but there were some red flags that made the experience a little awkward. Like the level of dirty the server's clothing and apron were, the dirty finger nails, the two children watching ipads and tv behind the bar, that we didn't get napkins and when we asked it took several minutes after our food had already arrived to get those napkins.   The person who brought our food out had filthy clothing, too, and I get that at a restaurant you're bound to get a little dirty but the level of dirty the clothing was and that early in the day, with no other customers... it was just too much.   The arancini were pretty basic but a decent appetizer and they had some sort of happy hour pricing. I liked their unique oyster selection and chose three to try while there. There presentation was incredible and the oysters were great, too. The pizza was pretty sad. The sauce tasted like straight tomato sauce with no herbs or flavor beyond its acidity and so soggy we probably would have had an easier time eating it with a spoon.   I think during a busy happy hour or in the evening a lot of what took away from the experience would go unnoticed but for the early part of the day and in an empty place it's too hard to unsee the kids playing behind the bar, the broken seats, the filthy staff clothing, and the subpar pizza."}
{"text":"It's difficult to imagine a much better oyster experience in Calgary. With something like 12 different varieties, the selection is top-tier, and each oyster was ice cold.  I also appreciated the citrusy, acidic accoutrements they serve with the oysters, as it made for the perfect palate cleanser between different varieties.  The bar appeared extremely clean as well.  Overall, a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. First was date night with my guy. We got to know Josh sitting up at the bar while he did his thing with oysters. Smoked oysters, pizza, wine and beer completed the evening. Delicious.  I've been here for pizza with YYC Pizza Week and also another time with the ladies for lunch. So far I haven't had a bad meal. The place is super cute, a former pizza place and easy to get to right on 17th.  The oyster line up is stellar and they have regular events as well as they get involved with community events as much as possible. And they are kid friendly! #bam"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon to try this place out.  Went on a Saturday morning for brunch right when they opened at 11.  We were the only table there until we finished (another table got seated as we were leaving).    We started with drinks, a strawberry milkshake and a strawberry lemonade.  The strawberry milkshake was good and not overly sweet.  The strawberry lemonade was interesting, with sour chunks of pickled strawberries to add flavor to a refreshing lemonade.  Had to add a little water because it was just sour on sour, but it was interesting and good.  For brunch food, we got the smoked trout benedict and the caprese pizza (have to try pizza at a pizza place).  The smoked trout benedict was great, capers lended a nice briny touch to the hollandaise and eggs were cooked perfectly.  It came with some hash browns and a small pile of strawberries.  The caprese was a mixed bag.  The crust was beautiful, crunchy and bready one of the best I've had.  However, the rest of the pizza was overly soggy as a result of the tomatoes.  While I appreciate the heirloom/beefsteak tomatoes on top, there was too much seeds which ended up getting soaked into the pizza.  Cheese was nice, would've like to seen some balsamic on the pizza which would've enhanced the flavour and gone with the \"caprese\" theme, also wanted more herbs (basil) on the pizza.  The pizza came with a side salad that was OK.  We were given a complimentary dessert of cinnamon rolls which were topped with cream cheese.  The texture of the rolls were a bit dry and hard, however the cream cheese frosting was very tasty with a good tang to balance with the sweetness.  Overall, great value with the Groupon.  Pizza was good enough that I need to come back to try some real pizza."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, service was great! Such a good night for a casual dinner with wine:) We tried the antipasta to start...such a good choice! Shared the fun guy pi and the seafood linguini!! So flavorful, amazing ingredients!!! We loved it, we will be going back for more:)"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Full Circle's brunch, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? Look, I'm not even a fan of brunch. Waiting for an hour or more in an interminable lineup to get what is, from what I've seen of brunch menus, basically breakfast has never appealed to me, and my last kick at the brunch can was so bad I'd sworn off the whole concept. But a houseguest here for Sled Island wanted brunch and so after crossing several places off my list because they're either too crowded, have terrible food, or both, I remembered seeing pics of interesting brunch items on the Full Circle twitter/IG/facebook feeds so off we went.  This was three weeks ago. We split an order of FC's amazing thrice-cooked fries because we ordered the eggs benny with bacon (avocado and trout are also on offer) and didn't see potatoes listed and, at the price, we didn't expect any side but maybe an orange slice. As it turned out, there are ample and beautiful, crispy home fries on the side, but the fries are so spectacular we still finished our split order, and more important is that the main was nothing short of spectacular. Full Circle makes its own English muffins!! The hollandaise is the best I've had in decades, lemony and...perfect. The whole affair was too much to dream, and we shared the dining room not with the crowds who SHOULD be coming here instead of [fill in the blank trendy spot in Bridgeland], but with a family of three and that was it. It was heartbreaking.  Not as heartbreaking as today, when I went by myself and got the absolutely astonishingly delicious bacon-onion pancake, which is a Dutch style pannenkoek, all crispy and amazing, which with a drizzle of syrup is the most mesmerizing and delicious combo of sweet and salty (from the glorious double-smoked bacon) I've had in... well, forever. I INHALED this thing. That part wasn't heartbreaking. Heartbreaking is the zero other customers there, on Stampede's last Saturday, when it should have been PACKED. This place should always be packed, but in particular, given the enormous popularity of brunch and the fact that Farm (across the street) is no more so that choice no longer exists, for brunch. I can't fathom why Full Circle isn't more popular. The food is better than amazing, prices are more than reasonable, service is top notch. I'll repeat my plea from my original review to go here- but in particular, this should be THE spot for brunch on 17th. Give it a chance; you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Remember that episode of The Simpsons when Homer goes to an all-you-eat seafood restaurant and essentially eats the entire ocean? That was me at Full Circle.   I've been there twice and both times it was for buck-a-shuck. And both times, I ate waaay too much. The staff is helpful and the menu is diverse! I think the name kinda alludes to that-- there are tons of pizza choices (although I have never ordered it yet), a wide variety of oysters with 3 sauces which are all super delicious too and a stocked bar with oodles of cocktails to sip on!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are somewhat unusual for its combination of ingredients. The taste are rather delightful but rather expensive for what you'll get."}
{"text":"So Full Circle Pizza and Oyster Bar has occupied a very odd location that used to be Bensonhurst and then some other establishment that I cannot remember (it only lasted a month or so).  Enter Full Circle Pizza and Oyster Bar, a very no-nonsense establishment (well ok, a bit of fun nonsense) that serves good pizza and a variety of oysters.  Couple that with a full bar and you've got a great thing going.... now if only someone told the rest of 17th avenue that there was another restaurant on this block (Roosevelt hogs most of the attention).  We got a very good deal from Travelzoo.  For $29 (reg. $61) we got an appetizer, a pizza and two drinks (cocktails, beer or wine included).  We added another pizza to that so our entire bill for three people was just shy of $70.  That's not too bad considering we had two cocktails.  The service was quite good.  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly.  He, along with the other wait staff had red suspenders on.  The theme of the place, although not too obvious was a bit on the whimsical side.  The washrooms were nice and clean. The mirrors had goofy facial accessories drawn on them with a marker so you can insert your face into the mirror and get a mid-meal chuckle.  For the pizzas we had the Flaming Moe and the Fibonacci's Golden Pi.  The Golden Pi had cherry tomatoes, red onion, zucchini, fennel and saffron.  It was just \"OK\" for me.  The Flaming Moe is what really stole me away.  The Moe had spicy peppers, calabrese salami, sriracha and red onion.  The Flaming Moe was flaming, but wasn't scorching hot.  It basically had the perfect balance of sweet (red onion), salty (salami) and hot (sriracha and peppers).  The crusts here are thin and moist.  The next time I check out this place I'll have a go at the oysters.  2 hours before close (usually 9pm on weekdays or 11pm on weekends) they have buck-a-shuck oysters."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Always arrives hot when I order delivery through skip the dishes!! D-liciousss!!!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this place and decided not to hold back... so we still managed to drop $100! The service was good and the atmosphere comfortable, nothing too fancy.   We ordered a beef carpaccio pizza, beef and oyster Tatare, sangria, a saison, a rioja, and the stoned wall (or something like that) cocktail. The tartare had good flavours but was over salted, especially in combination with the cheese crisps it accompanied. Maybe if they had take  out the capers and served it with egg yolk like I'd seen in some pictures online it would have been better, less salty and a touch creamy. The pizza was very good and had simple flavours to enjoy, tangy tomato sauce, bit of peppery green with shaved cheese, and of course the carpaccio which could have used a bit more flavour.  If you're  looking for a heavy loaded pizza, look to another option. They don't skimp on the beef but as it is carpaccio, the beef is thin.  Drinks were tasty, and the oysters were delicious! I will definitely be coming back for buck a shuck! Anyone know if they have caesar oyster shots? Yum! Will be asking about that next time for sure!  Happy shuckin"}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive things about this place. We started with oysters and they were fresh and lovely.  Briny sweet nectar of the sea.  That was followed by the sharing app platter. This was generous and filled with tasty options.  I really loved the cracker like bread that accompanied the platter.     We shared the pizza special which featured brisket and Gorgonzola with roasted tomatoes.  Sounds slightly odd but came together delightfully.   Can't wait to go back again. The service was attentive and the ambiance nice and comfortable."}
