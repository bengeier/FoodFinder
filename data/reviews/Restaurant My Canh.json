{"text":"The best ever! We went twice in two days. The food was fresh and the service was fabulous.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant when you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Un dimanche soir froid à Montréal, quel bonheur de trouver un endroit rempli de personnes dégustant des \"pho\" et d'autres plats vietnamiens. Décor sans prétention, tout est dans les plats savoureux. Les bouillons sont très bien épicés, les légumes croquants et les portions généreuses."}
{"text":"Full flavored broth makes their pho some of the best in downtown Montreal. Everything else on the menu is equally as tasty, from the appetizers to the desserts. Service is welcoming and speedy, always at the top of my list when craving pho."}
{"text":"Très bonne soupe Tonkinoise. Par contre, on se rend certainement pas la pour l'ambiance, mais bien pour leur repas réconfortant."}
{"text":"Tried a noodle dish that comes with shrimps and 2 spring rolls,was tasty enough I would do it again. The owners are nice and the restau is clean enough but they could work on the restrooms better."}
{"text":"I went to this place following recommendation from a few friends. I have to agree that this restaurant provide a very good quality food for the price but the service is pretty bad. The person taking the orders took them all wrong and had to confirmed twice with us. if you're ok with poor service, good price and tasty food... you will love this place"}
{"text":"My other favourite pho restaurant in Montreal. Really good pho. Don't be discouraged by the no-frills, borderline rundown ambiance.

Staff have always been very friendly every time I've been there. They're all Vietnamese, but I've had no problems communicating either in English or French."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very High quality/price rate. I had a lunch combo with a Soup and a chicken vermicelles dish. 
For 10$ I ate absolutely fantastic vietnamese food, tasty and full of various flavors! 
You can guess that it is very fresh.
They serve Unlimited Jasmine Tea. The place is clean but very simple. The service is very nice, Quick and attentive to your needs. I ate by myself but had a nice table and the waiter even gave me a chair to put my bag on. Nothing wrong to say about this spot. It was almost full. I will definitely advise everyone to try it again and again!"}
{"text":"delicious shredded pork vermicelli bowl, with the little chitlins sprinkled on top, mmmmmm...... best I've had outside of southern CA (which has a huge Vietnamese population). It would've been nice to have a napkin, but I can overlook that."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Vietnamese food I've had, even compared to the places in Los Angeles. 

For $11, you can get a huge bowl of pho (size large) with a LOT of meat and noodles. The broth was really flavorful and the meat was tender. I ordered the rare beef and well done beef bowl and it didn't disappoint. Usually the amount of meat and noodles is disproportionate, but this time I found myself with meat to go with my noodles even at the end of the bowl. My only complaint would be that the broth in my brother's rare beef pho was rather oily. 

We also tried the bahn xeo, which was very good too. The shrimp had lot of flavor while the chicken did not, but in all was very good when paired with the vegetables and seasonings."}
{"text":"I came here once in 2008 and it was good enough that we had to come back when we visited Montreal in Sept 2013.  Why you ask I write this review now a year and a half later?  Bc I finally created a yelp account and I have a very good memory. :-) The Pho is delicious.  I am a Pho lover back in the states, but this Pho here is delicious.  I don't know if it is the cilantro that makes it extra special kick or just that the broth is made extra special.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I know I'm coming back here on my next trip to Montreal.  Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Super authentic Vietnamese food! Best Bún Bò Hu I've tasted, and I've tried the ph/bún in Vancouver, NY, Philadelphia, LA, Melbourne, Sydney. We also had the grilled beef vermicelli, the beef was so perfectly cooked and marinated.


It came with a chicken broth soup which was sooooo delicious!
Tastes exactly like it does in Vietnam."}
{"text":"I ate here after trying several of the Vietnamese / Chinese places in Montreal's Chinatown and found it to be a truly wonderful and authentic experience.  The spring rolls are thick and the peanut sauce wasn't runny as other places will have.  I orders the Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef noodle soup ( a must try alternative to pho) and found it to be authentic.   Although it lacked the rau ram ( herbs) the broth was clean and just a bit weak on the spicy side.   The meat was traditional bun bo meat with tendon and flank instead of the usual pho meats.   

Once small gripe was that they didn't turn on the air conditioning but so j was sweating like a fat girl on roller skates but it was still a wonderful meal.  They also accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"One of the better Vietnamese restuarants in Chinatown, much better than PBNY down the road. Would come back for another meal after I've done my round of the remaining Viet places in the area."}
{"text":"Authentic pho. My girlfriend and I were in search of an authentic viet restaurant while we were in Montreal and we decided to come here. The broth was authentic and tasted rich and flavorful. My girlfriend had Bun Bo Hue, unfortunately the broth was not as flavorful as the pho but it surely passed as authentic. Even the way this place looks just reminds of you of vietnam."}
{"text":"A great place for pho! The pho is big portion and cheap and remember to order ??? with it, it's a magical combination. Their rice is pricey and not so good compared to pho."}
{"text":"Came here a few times, and each time the food was double F: fast and fresh :) 

The chicken vermicelli bowl was very tasty, the beef and rice dish just ok, and the pho (tonkinese soup) was subpar. They use a lot of MSG in their soups as drinking a few spoonfuls gave me a huge headache. 

Service could be better. Each time I went I was served by a man who spoke Cantonese and vietnamese (both of which I can understand but not speak) but very little English or French. I had questions and it was a huge struggle to communicate and instead of asking one of the other workers to come (whom I heard speaking English) he simply declared to them in viet that I just didn't know what I wanted. Oh well, at least they didn't start talking crap about me in viet like other typical vietnamese establishments.

Secondly, somehow my bill was 30 cents higher than the price on the menu. Not going to argue about 30 cents but still. To finish, the girl at the counter eyed me like a hawk as I was leaving a tip at the counter (maybe she thought i would tip her more this way?). 

Ok so service is terrible but I never consider that in my reviews of Asian restos. Overall, the place was clean and the food was ok, solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho! Try the chicken with lemongrass - it's delicious, flavourful, and you can really taste the lemongrass. Mmmmm..... Pho..... They're not cheap on the portions either - you get a massive bowl of soup even when ordering the regular size. With such affordable prices,  you just can't go wrong.  Service is quick, so you can be in and out pretty fast if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Ate at this vietnamese restaurant last year while walking around the chinatown area. Their sugar cane drink was one of the best - freshly made and super delicious. Tried their chicken & pork pho, spring roll, and vietnamese iced coffee. The pho was good, but not the best. But the spring roll, viet iced coffee was super delicious. Staff was wonderful and super nice. Dining environment was nice, and place was spacious."}
{"text":"Very down to earth place. Was quite packed during lunch time. Still got my spring roll and pho within a few minutes. Spring roll was average.  Broth was very tasty and came out very hot. Soup is really great value for money. Great spot for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Abordable, service efficace et courtois, propre mais ce ne serait pas mon premier choix de resto si j'avais à choisir sur un coup de tête. Par contre, comme la plupart des reviews mentionnent, leurs bouillons sont très délicieux."}
{"text":"Very good soups in addition to the regular go-to pho. I got a seafood with blocks of pig's blood in a very spicy seafoody broth and delicious noodles.

The 3-color dessert is delicious as well as a finishing touch."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town from Chicago and are basically eating our was through Montreal. With that said, this is probably the best food and service we've experienced here. It's not fancy, but it doesn't matter. Upon walking in, we were warmly invited to sit down and given hot tea. The server helped us with our order because there were a few vegetarian options that were hard to choose from. After placing our order, they brought us some fried veggie rolls on the house, the freshest I've ever had. We got the curried veggies and tofu over vermacilli and the veggie tofu pancake. If you've never had the latter, it's not what you would expect. You tear of pieces and wrap it up in lettuce. There is a delicious dipping sauce. Our server was not only hospitable, but had a great sense of humor. I wish I could pack up this joint and bring them to Chicago!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a Delicious Pho. 
Try the Phnom Penh (Grounded Pork, Sliced Pork, Shrimps, sliced Vietnamese sausage, rice noodles and more) with the soup on the side start eating your dish without the soup and halfway pour the soup into your bowl of happiness for a great meal. The staff is friendly and the place is often packed with regulars because the food is great. Take out is also fast you order and it's ready in 10 minutes. I had to order for many coworkers because people kept asking for a bite whenever I'd eat some in the workplace."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Vietnamese food! The environment of the restaurant is practically a dump. But the food is delicious! Had the owner of the restaurant decided to redecorate, tidy up the place, and manage it in a more updated way, this can attract a lot of customers and become a much more popular major go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent pho shop in Montreal! The broth was light and deep with flavor. Also tried the banh xeo and it was quite filling. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely come back for more pho."}
{"text":"Very good pho. The rare beef and also the chicken soups are good choices.  It's very cramped and hot (ac?), plus not very clean."}
{"text":"I've tried \"Hu tieu Nam Vang\" and \"Chao long\" and they are both delicious. The taste here is nice and similar with the foos back in Vietnam. Worth trying for all Vietnamese food lover!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews. The pho was pretty good, but on the saltier side. I ordered a small and felt like there was very little meat compared to noodles. Second time I came here, I had the vermicelli. Not good. Again, I felt like there were too many noodles compared to everything else. The noodles were also quite dry. And no AC! :("}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese I've found in Montreal.  
Everything here is excellent.  Noodles always done just right, never overcooked. 
Their bún (noodle bowls) are so fresh and delicious - I recommend the grilled beef.
The Pho broth is wonderfully flavorful, lots of herbs!  
Amazing Goi Cuon + peanut sauce.  
Super-FAST service.

The only downside is the decor.  The quality of the food more than makes up for this, though."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is so good!
They gave you first the soup with noodles - 5stars!!!! 
Then the portion of food is so huge!
It doesn't matter, the flavor is all in there!!! 
Montreal has a lot of good restaurants I must say!"}
{"text":"I really felt like a bowl of hot pho soup and decided to check this place out.

The Phnom Penh soup that I ordered was ok. The broth was acceptable, and the shrimp were fresh, but it didn't strike me as especially tasty. I found the portion to be on the smaller side vs other Pho places that I've visited.

The service was quick and warm."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here and recommended \"Mi Lakay\". It was really tasty egg noodles (make sure you ask for the so-called 'dried version'). The restaurant was quite small but cozy"}
{"text":"There is nothing more restorative than great pho after a night out.  This is great pho.  The staff is super friendly and solicitous."}
{"text":"There are a few times in my life where eating becomes an almost religious experience. 

I think each time involved a combination of hunger, non ridiculous expectations/ sense of entitlement and excellent food. 

This place provided my most recent such epic experience with the best pho I've ever had!! 

Seriously this place is amazing! 

The broth was rich and delicious.  

The noodles perfectly cooked. 

The meat...  Ooh the meat.  I've never had such tender delicious meat (no immature jokes please) in a bowl of pho before. Seriously it was like filet mignon. They must marinate it here and the meat must be of good quality for it to almost melt in your mouth with each bite. 

In comparison, here in New Jersey, even the most popular Vietnamese restaurants serve pho with meat that is chewy, more tough and less flavorful. 

I've had pho from Vancouver to NYC to Maryland. This place takes the cake for best pho I've ever had. 

The owner seems like a really friendly and cool dude too, giving us tips on things to do since we were from our of town."}
{"text":"Had food two times here, affordable price, amazing broth and pork woupe!

I will say the price of rice related dish is kind of expensive, but their medium size pho is other restaurants' large(almost) so choose pho and porridge would be a good idea."}
{"text":"My favorite Tonkin soup in Chinatown and in Montreal. I've tried many soups on the menu over the years, they're always good. Always friendly service. Prices remained affordable. There are some vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This is my to go Pho in town. I had many of their soups and they are all delicious. I finally tried the bahn xeo (Vietnamese pancake), it is so good. I love the fact that you have to eat it with your hands, you cut the pancake with some filling, you put it in lettuce, you add some mint leaves and you dip it into the sauce. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Pho MC in chinatown location. 
The spring roll (pork, shrimp and vermicelli wrapped in rice paper) were freshly made pair with tasty peanuts sauce. 
The imperial is great, filled with chicken and shrimp, it comes with the usual fish sauce dipping but I prefer to pair it with peanuts sauces.
Their pho are okay, too much MSG though and it made me super thirsty but taste not bad.
They will need to work on their service, one of the waiter was completely on a cloud. The pho arrive but not the usual plate of chop suey and lime. So I asked him if he can bring me one, he said yes but instead of bring it to me, he prefer to clean 4 tables before bringing it to me. No smile, no apologies, rude."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic, and inexpensive Tonkin soup with a really flavorful broth. It had an indescribable mix of special spices, almost cinnamon-y but not sweet. HUGE PORTION. I lucked upon this place because it happened to be near my hotel. Will return on my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I just bought a can sugar drink. I waited more than 5 min to be served and for 3.75 CAD, the glass was completely full of ice cubes. It didn't taste fresh cane sugar and it was mixed with lemon juice. For this price, I expected a 100% can fresh sugarcane juice with no lemon.

Also they should ventilate more inside the place. It smelled strongly stale."}
{"text":"Fresh and typical vietnamese spot, though not enough varieties in terms of traditional vietnamese soup. The food is fresh due to it's popularity. I myself stopped going because there are such better places in the area."}
{"text":"I want it all! Love everything at this restaurant, including the service! As soon as you step into the restaurant, you feel welcomed by the staff. Best in town. The pho is as good as it gets. The banh xeo reminded me of when my grandma used to make it! The bun plates are so yummy! Everything is excellent down to the three colour dessert. I can't wait to try the other MC in Brossard. Craving real authentic vietnamese food? Go to My Canh!!! I am on my way there. Tonight is going to be spring rolls, imperial rolls, bun bo huê and an \"all-dressed\" pho!"}
