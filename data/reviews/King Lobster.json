{"text":"Worst service. They mess up my orders all the time. They also hung up on me when I tried to order one time.  I don't think they understand English very well.  The way they cook dishes varies, so you don't know what to expect when you order the same dish.  They also do not pay attention to allergy requests."}
{"text":"Yummy! I like this place a lot. Usually one of the places my family goes to for a good Chinese dinner. They serve you super delicious food pretty fast. As well, it does not cost a fortune! The price is pretty reasonable for the food you are getting. Good service in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had the Peking duck. I think that's the only place in Toronto where you can get this delivered. Really nice. Good meat just a little too fat. But its the original with pancakes, veggies and the skin is seperate..."}
{"text":"Ive gone to at least 60% of all the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown and King Lobster is definitely my go-to restaurant. The food comes in large portions and normally when I go with my girlfriend, we order 1 fried rice and 1 soup and we're good to go and all for under $15. The restaurant is also open super late (like 5am) and they have a night time menu with cheaper prices. Definitely a great Chinese place to eat at if youre out late!"}
{"text":"Though I haven't found any Chinese worth writing home about thus far in Toronto, King Lobster has probably come the closest with the four or five restaurants I've tried. I've ordered from here twice and though the first time wasn't great, the second time was actually pretty damn good!  My friend and I ordered the pork dumplings, as well as one veggie spring roll and one pork for appetizers. For main dishes, we ordered the shanghai noodles, chicken with black bean sauce and BBQ pork with mixed veggies.   It may have been that we were hungry, but everything was pretty tasty. I wouldn't say anything stood out. Compared to some of the other shanghai noodles I've had in Toronto, these ones were pretty good. Price is pretty average ($40) and the delivery time was as expected (about 40 minutes or so). Portions were pretty generous and our order fed us the next day as well.   I would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"G Tao chicken is amazing. Cantonese chow mein just like my grandma used to make. Service spectacular. Check out the fish named Chufoo. Paul one of the guys here is the man. Will set you up with anything you need. This should be your go to late night Chinese food joint. Some of the best night of my life have ended here. Love you king lobster."}
{"text":"This is going to be the last time I ever go to this place again.  This place had really bad service and I was very dissappointed.  I didn't mind the food, it was good but when you have to ask for more water or tea two or three times and there are 3 workers working on the floor taking care of 3 tables there is a problem there.  Never again!  You will be waiting a very long time to be serviced and it will take you a while to get your beverages and your bill!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here last night.   They do delivery until 5AM! Huge bonus for me. Delivery took about 40 minutes. Standard.   Ordered: Wontons in sweet and sour sauce - Yummy! They were flaky and crispy and delicious. My favorite part of the meal and the portion was large.   Orange chicken/Sweet and sour chicken - I ordered both of these dishes but they tasted the same (one came on a bed of rice). Maybe they use similar sauce or mixed up the order? Not bad. Vegetables used were not very fresh though.   Steamed rice - Good. HUGE portion! I ordered medium comparing it to the portion I normally get at Swatow (a ball that could fit in two hands). Ordered medium and got a full takeout  container which I was thrilled about. Curious how big the large is!   Bill total = $28.31.   Considering that I'll have food for the next three days, very good value. Good option if you're hungry and don't want to spend much (or leave the house!). I would order again."}
{"text":"The quality of their General Tao's chicken has been on a steady decline for the past couple years. It used to be succulent, and the sauce was sweet with the perfect amount of spice. A couple years ago the actual chicken they use changed, which was okay I suppose, but then they started messing with that perfect sauce. It's now extremely spicy (I love spicy food, but this is spice that just completely masks the flavour). Also, a lot of the chicken pieces in the dish didn't even have ANY sauce on them at all, which was just sloppy. Fortunately, and the reason I keep coming back, is their Crab Claws. They're as juicy and flavourful as ever.   Overall, it's a great place to go for a heaping plate of cheap n' tasty eats."}
{"text":"Two words - PEAKING DUCK !!!  We used Just-Eat.ca to order \"Peaking Duck in two styles\" from King Lobster.  It was on top of the 'Chef Recommendation' list, so we thought we'd try it. For those who've never tried Peaking Duck before, let me give you an intro.  Peaking Duck is prized for it's thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. . The meat is eaten with pancakes, scallion, and hoisin sauce or sweet bean sauce.  The peaking duck came with 10 thin pancakes, sauces on the side, and light vegetables.  We then create a canape out of them - you decide how much or how little meat / vegetable / sauce you want to use - wrap it in the pancake and put it in your mouth.  It was SCRUMPTIOUS!    The duck goes really well with a nice glass of Pinot Noir - I had it with the \"Oakridge Pinot Noir 2010, Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia\" from the LCBO."}
{"text":"China Town delivers again!  Stumble in at 3 am with a group of 10 people and you get a table full of delicious chinese plates for 10$ a pop.    The staff was very friendly and attentive, make sure to ask for the \"budweiser\" tea haha.  Get the lemon chicken, they really knock it out of the park!"}
{"text":"ripped off on a lobster delivery. I ordered 2 lobsters with butter and vinegar on the side. What I got was one box with 1/8th a tail one claw and legs. and the same on the other box. 75% of the lobster missing. and REFUSED TO CREDIT ME....the lobster i got was drenched in butter and no vinegar . Love their food, hate that they dont know i ve cooked 1000s of lobsters and know what a WHOLE one looks like unless its damaged"}
{"text":"This has become our latest go-to joint for Chinese food.  They make delicious and consistent Cantonese dishes.  They don't overdue it with the oil nor the MSG, which are huge pluses for me.  A must try dish (I don't think it's on their regular menu, as we always just order it by name) is their pork cheek meat and veggie stir fry.  The pork cheek meat has a perfect crunchy consistency and when cooked with the snap peas and king oyster mushrooms the dish is amazing.    Another favourite is Chinese broccoli with preserved Chinese meats (i.e. Chinese sausage and preserved Chinese pork belly).  Again, not sure whether this is on their regular menu."}
{"text":"Average. Service was quick and efficient but once the rush came in you can tell that was out the window. The general tso chicken was awful, it was served a bit cold and was dried out. The lobster with the black bean sauce was  tasty, but I've had better. I ended up coming here because it wasn't busy and I was looking for a quick in and out. It started to get busy after 1:30am (all the clubbers).  Not sure if I would make it a regular place to eat."}
{"text":"Most sauces supplemented with slimey gel like filler. Once you notice a patch of it not \"properly\" mixed in the meal will be ruined. A little on the salty side too but the quality of the seafood actually isn't bad. If only the rest of the menu could stack up. I've had take out and dined in. It's probably 3/5 if you're eating in house but those damned filler sauces absolutely ruin it for me overall.   If you want 100% natural food. Steer clear."}
{"text":"Best over-priced Vancouver crab I have ever had! I mean, $30 for a crab? Not everyone is Bill Gates you know... I can only afford it on an annual basis"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese resto. A bit dirty, lack of any real customer service, cheap but damn good.   This place opens at 4pm -6am which is odd but for late night cravings it makes sense.   Even tho I've never eaten lobster here they have some pretty good specials during certain times.   My main gripe is they charged me for tea. Come on now."}
{"text":"Ok, I stumbled in here at around 3 am in a pirate costume with two fellow pirates...Don't ask.  We were very hungry and perhaps heavily intoxicated.  I don't recall looking at the menu or ordering at all.  I just remember maintaining my pirate character and saying aaarrrrrrrr a lot. The waitress didn't even flinch, so props to her for that.  All 3 of us were served a mountain of fried rice.  Literally, you could probably hike up it.  Actually, it was mostly rice.  On occasion, you might get lucky with a green pea and perhaps even a little egg.  I recall one delightful bite that may have even had some meat in it."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Anytime I'm in Toronto i have to have a deep fried crab claw and the salt and pepper shrimp. Food is consistently excellent. The general tso's is also very good. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Great late-night spot - catches the 2 AM club crowd stumbling in after a night out, but waiters are really cool about it. Food is fast, cheap, and greasy; perfect after one too many drinks. Portions are perfect for one person.  I wouldn't come here on a weekday when other places are open, but late in the evening - the hours are accommodating, and the price is right."}
