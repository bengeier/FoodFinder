{"text":"Saw this bakery on facebook and got excited. My family is gluten and sugar free. Came to order a cake and decided to have waffles with fruits and cappuccino.  I made a mistake that I paid for my cake and all this already. Cappuccino was so tiny, like in Italian restaurant. It is $3.50 and I would expect a regular size like in any other coffee shop. While I was waiting for waffles one lady came in to pick up her cake that she ordered. When she saw the cake she started hesitating, she was a bit confused. Then she said that cake looked very bad and not presentable and writing was like a kid did it. I didn't see it myself, but she left and didn't take it. I finally got my waffles with fruits. The fruit salad was in a soup bowl and it looked so bad. Apples were chopped in tiny pieces, strawberries were cut big, bananas already had a color to it. Too bad I didn't take a photo. The waffles were on tiny plate and were hard to eat. This place has an issue with decoration and presentation. I left really worried about my cake for my birthday. That evening I called them and wanted to make sure that it will be nice looking and I would do a photo shoot with it. The lady said that she can put fruits on if I wanted or put some writing on. Please look at photos on google maps review.  My parents picked up this \"masterpiece\". I almost cried when I saw the size and look of it. I paid $50 and was expecting a regular size cake. I called and they told me that they informed me it was 6\" and that it was heavy like a regular size cake. Well, maybe I didn't pay attention to size, but decor is unacceptable. How can you charge this much money and give this to customer, my little daughter does a better job decorating. Healthy ingredients doesn't give you an excuse to cut corners on decor.  It tasted good, but it is not an achievement, cakes suppose to taste good. I doubt this place will last long."}
{"text":"Amazing find. Great coffee, such a rarity to find a place that really care about how coffee tastes. They use Oro Cafe coffee, which is hard to find in this city, but if you visited Italy, you'd be familiar with. 

Great selection of gluten free and vegan products. I work in an office that has a diversity of dietary needs and now we can order food thru UberEats straight to the office. 

Pastry is really great. We ordered birthday cakes for the office, and everyone was very happy. Whether it's chocolate, vanilla or fruit, we never had any leftovers. 

Try their sweet potato+mushroom chili. It's out of this world. Also really good variety of salads, wraps and soups made fresh daily."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Skip the Dishes today and we were highly disappointed. We have NEVER had such disappointing vegan food in our lives. Tasteless, bland, no personality. The ideas are great (vegan perogies, vegan pulled jackfruit, etc), but they can't seem to deliver when it comes to taste. Literally nothing tasted seasoned. Reminded me of non-vegans trying to make vegan food and failing utterly miserably. Maybe their desserts are better than their meals, who knows? And for the price that we paid (over $100), we don't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy delicious desserts. Gluten free, dairy free (vegan), no refined sugar, nut free, etc., and great tasting. My favourite so far is the amazing chocolate cake. Friendly and knowledgeable owners."}
{"text":"I do laundry next door, and there is no best place go in the meantime. The coffee is great, the food is very healthy and tasty. 
It is a new place, so it needs people to give it some love.

{"text":"Awesome espresso. Delicious almost guilt-free treats ( sugar, gluten, nut - free). A welcome addition to the area filled with chains... Finally something different! We started  buying beans there as well for home - great quality for coffee addicts :) worth stopping by."}
