{"text":"Great pizza. Friendly/Social Staff. Fun environment. Super location. The pianists, Spadoni & Bennie Bonobo are pretty rad too. Evel Pizza is legit. I'm a fan.   May even go back tonight..."}
{"text":"Pizza so good you can't stop eating!! Took the family and had a cheese and pepperoni, so good, crust was perfect, amount of cheese was just right, and they use those little pepperoni that curl up when cooked! Yum! Also had a salad which was tasty with peppers and onions. Love the decor, very fun and the kids love it too! Definitely found a new favorite to go for pizza!!"}
{"text":"First time here andthe food was good but the cashier and bartender were extremely rude hence the reason for the low rating."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Really nice vibe and the pizza reminds me of New York. Love it!"}
{"text":"Best pepperoni pizza in Vegas. Love the root beer on draft. Awesome fun atmosphere. Cheap and delicious eats/drinks, you can't go wrong! They have all kinds of good pizzas but I usually stick with the classic pepperoni."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza, easily the best in town! I visit New York often and this is hands down the best pizza outside of the city! Theme and decor are perfect! Will be recommending this to many friends and can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Back in the 70's, we used to watch Evel Knievel jump buses with his motorcycle on ABC's Wide World of Sports.  We would then run outside, build flimsy ramps, hop on our bikes, and then jump over strange objects until someone crashed and ended the fun.  This place is not so much a destination, as a pilgrimage for all us kids who received scars as we emulated the greatest daredevil of our age. The place is small inside, and loaded with some of the best Knievel memorabilia one can find.  It even includes his trademarked video game and pinball machine!  There's also a small, portable TV with a video loop of some of his more famous jumps.   As for the food, I opted for the Pizza Slice and Beer combo for $5.00.  That deal gets you a large slice of cheese pizza, with a pint of PBR- definitely a throwback to Evel's heyday.  It was delicious, BTW.  There were other pizzas you could buy, and the bar had plenty of libations available.  I couldn't imagine drinking anything other than beer or a straight whiskey there, though. So, for anyone who finds him/herself longing for something different in a town of 'differents', this is a great place to visit."}
{"text":"Upon calling I was told you are not able to order to-go via phone.. only an online app but they don't have their full menu on the online to-go app... maybe next time."}
{"text":"This place has a dive bar meets pizza shop vibe, and it seems trendy. The place is littered with random stickers and the vibe is fun, laid back. The framed pictures all over the walls are mostly old vegas imagery, some Even Knievel/motorcycle stuff is hanging as well. I especially like the Evel Knievel arcade games in the back, I wonder where the owner found those gems!   The slices are delicious and the selection is big enough that probably anyone, can find something to eat. They don't concern me but I bet someone who follows a vegan or gluten free diet would appreciate those options on the menu. They are limited, but they're there. With the help of a friend, I tried four different, delicious slices and finished off with the Led Zeppole (fried dough).  I liked the variety of music too, ranging from Social Distortion to Peaches. I'm pretty sure I heard Styx too. Rock on! I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"YUM! Cheap and fast too. As far as customer service-- it was ok-- nothing extra special, but did the job! The cheese slice with a beer was 5$. We opted for the specialty pizza that was 5.50 for a huge slice! Would definitely recommend and would return for some pizza!"}
{"text":"I walked up and thought to myself 'am I even cool enough to go in here?' But we did and we were. Great staff. Amazing food. Good prices."}
{"text":"Good vibes, good pizza, bartender did not know how to make a requested drink but took the time to try and made it bomb ! Def. coming back"}
{"text":"Stopped by Evel Pie on a hunch from the boys at Golden Tiki. This place sets the standard for Vegas pizza joints. Sat at the bar about midnight and got served up within 10-15 minutes with a couple slices of pepperoni and an order of hot wings. When on Fremont, take a stroll down towards the end, its well worth it."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! My bartender Kay was incredible! Definitely check this girl out when you go"}
{"text":"Great spot.. Pizza was super fresh and crispy!! Staff was on point all around good vibes and good people.. staff member came running out after us cuz we left our wallet.. real honest good people with real good pies"}
{"text":"Super bomb pizza by the slice  with great food & drink specials, cheap happy hour, and awesome customer service"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza for the price. The slice was small and tasteless. There's a better pizza place at the Plaza"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better pizza. Some of the most diverse music playing in Vegas as well. Highly recommend Evel Pie!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer combo. All for less than any drink you can find in Vegas. Chelsea and everyone that works there are awesome! Check this place out if you are around Fremont Street."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST if you are around downtown or Fremont St. Scratch that. If you are in the state of Nevada, you need some Evel Pie in your life. They have awesome pizza and beer specials, with really interesting, and tasty, flavors. I, personally, like pairing the Bary White with other flavored pies to really expand you palette. You'll get the feeling that this spot has always been a part of downtown, even though it's relatively new. Go now. Eat. Drink. Chill."}
{"text":"Well I would have to say this was my first time inside the evil pie and it was quite unique besides the atmosphere and all of the memorabilia of Evel Knievel the food was excellent. I just love pizza and beer. I will be going back. Next time I will try there rattlesnake Pizza."}
{"text":"Visited a pizza place where they had fun memorabilia all over the walls, good music to listen to, and delicious pizza.  Close to easy parking.  This was a wonderfully good find in downtown Las Vegas.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"So I felt bad for the cashier who was trying to work the long line while being the bartender as well. While the manager looked like he was high and just walking randomly around the building. No desire to help the line or the bar to Idk maybe help her out!  I order 1 slice of pizza. It took 15 minutes to reheat 1 slice of pizza. Domino's delivers in under 30 from scratch.  as my pizza slice is being burnt to a crisp as I'm now at the register asking for a refund , which the cashier/ bartender girl has no idea how to give me the refund, finally the guy walking around high on pot finally goes to help her out. Then as I tell him on the way out that it should never take 1 slice of pizza to take f**ing 15 minutes, he then says im kicked out and can never come back. Then keeps cussing at me while outside with 25 people walking by, Let's say this United States Marine kept it in check and left, i could care less if im kicked out or not, Pizza Rock is around the corner, no big deal. But hey customers if you want to wait in long lines with piss poor service and average pizza for over $ 5 go for it. Way to treat your customers, on 1st visit no less lol I'm glad the owner let's his managers work on the clock while high. Seems like a smart business decision. He's working in a kitchen how dumb are you to get high on the job. I hope for his sake that no innocent person gets hurt if he were to do something stupid in the kitchen, not sure if you can claim high on the insurance claim when it happens. Matter of when not If!!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza. You seat yourself and go up to order but the service is great. Price is good. Would be nice if a smaller pizza option was possible. We needed more than a few slices so bought the 20\" pizza. We ended up giving half our pizza to a homeless guy so it didn't go to waste."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on weekday for a \"Happy Hour \" fundraiser where 100% of the sales went to support The Gay and Lesbian Center of Southern Nevada or The Center LV.  The pizza was delicious and a very large portion. The servers were very friendly and I really appreciated their enthusiasm for fundraising for The Center LV .  The decor and ambience of this place is super funloving, funky and eclectic. It's an outrageous homage to Evel Knevel and 1970's Americana. Be sure to check it out, it's a great spot for a quick bite and a nostalgic trip down memory lane."}
{"text":"Great chill spot for a slice and drink when you're done wandering Fremont St. Recommend the Goblin Sausage and Balls to the Wall, and the bartender mixes a spot-on afternoon margarita."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a slice of pizza. Prices are $4-5.50 a slice.  Not the best pizza but good downtown location and fast."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas this place is a must. Some of the best pizza I've had in a long time and the staff was excellent! Not to mention the PBR was exceptional too! Also has hip cool atmosphere. Not a big place but it works. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff. Loved this place. Snake river pizza some of the best pizza I have had."}
{"text":"Finally I found a new favorite pizza spot!! And can't beat how the place feels! Such a rad hangout spot open super late. Pizza is so damn good. The Maui Wowie hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"Great service and a wonderful spot to get a cheap bite downtown. I love that they have more than just the standard slices (cheese or pepperoni) and the prices are really great. The place is a little crowded and cramped but the food is good and worth the packed space and wait. I would definitely come back when I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service! The place was not even crowded and they still took waaaay too long to get us our order. Definitely not worth the super long wait for mediocre pizza.  Also, I got food poisoning from the one slice I ate. Apparently washing their hands is not a requirement.  Just go to Pizza Rock down the street. It's a much better and safer option."}
{"text":"Holy Crap! The pizza here is so good! There must be something in the water! You also have to try the Meatballs in Evel tomato sauce! They have a huge selection of craft beer and will help you pick one that will go best with your food too! The decor is one of the best things about this place, if you're on Fremont Street at all you have to stop by!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! This was suggested to me by a local Lyft driver, and he was definitely right that this pizza joint is better than all the others in the area.   Great price for an extremely delicious generous slice of pizza.   The garlic knots were also delicious, though in my opinion were a bit overly dense.   The Evel Kneivel theme of this place is also on point.. hipster-rock I say?  I do wish this was closer to the Strip though."}
{"text":"This is our second visit and we were celebrating my husband's birthday. This was his choice because he loves the food, vibe, music, atmosphere, beer selection and memorabilia. In addition to pizza, we also purchased meatballs and garlic knots and all were delicious! We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I debated between 2 and 3 stars for this review. I opted for 2. There was nothing that morally offended me about this pizza, but I was also just disappointed.  The decor here is cute - very Evel-themed. Parents, be warned that some of the decor is not exactly child-friendly.   The staff definitely fit the theme of the bar. They seem to be very friendly with regulars. They aren't so friendly if you aren't a regular. We were first over-charged, and the cashier wasn't too happy when we asked about it. Then, when she corrected the total, we weren't asked if we would like the change. It was just assumed that we didn't want it.   The pizza was okay. It was easily some of the thinest pizza I have ever had. We are talking paper-thin. The pizza just sorely lacked any flavor. Even the pepperoni on the pizza needed more flavor.   This is certainly not a pizza I would go back for. It seems targeted more so to the drinking crowd."}
{"text":"Great location - buh-bye baby bottle hipster fondu place! We had pizza and wings and all six of us liked the food. The service was fast and friendly. The music they play in this place was excellent. We kept pulling out Shazam going, \"damn I know I remember this one, but I can't remember the name!\" The nostalgic stuff all over the walls also kept conversations going with a lot more of the, \"oh yeah, I remember that!\". I had to take a picture of the Billy Squier bumper sticker that looks like it came from Detroit's WRIF/101.1 in the 80s and send it to my brother. Definitely a do-over the next time we are looking for pizza on Fremont East, which is pretty often."}
{"text":"Great little place downtown for either a slice of pizza or a whole pie. Laid back atmosphere with tons of memorabilia. We sat at the bar & ordered a couple of slices. Balls to the wall & Barry white. It's NY style pizza that's thin with a puffy crust. Not too flimsy....really good. Prices are reasonable too. Everyone was friendly & provided excellent service. We definitely will return."}
{"text":"Evel Pie's vegan pizza is awesome. The vibe is super cool and it's reasonably priced. Ali and Kelly are both great. Definitely worth a trip to see those two, but the pizza is an added bonus."}
{"text":"My husband and I got pizza, wings, and garlic knots. Pizza and wings were awesome! I usually love garlic knots, but I wasn't a big fan of theirs. But it's definitely a neat little spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing pie, great beer on tap, unbeatable service. One of the best if not the best spot on Fremont to get great food and have a good time."}
{"text":"This pizza place is awesome. New York giant slices...pinball...beer from a motorcycle helmet cause its vegas. The Evel Knievel stuff is fun. Come eat great pizza and play a 70s evel knievel pinball machine."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it but couldn't. Weird space, overbaring waitstaff....once you get someone to help you.   Pro tip: don't ask for a menu. What's wrong with you? Asking for a menu in a restaurant.  Super salty and the crust is tough tough tough.   Keep in mind, I paid full price. Its edible. The slice specials and the $20 beer and whole pie pricing are good."}
{"text":"Being Gluten Free I was super excited to come here and get some pizza as I love when I have new options but the night ended up being a disappointment. The staff was friendly but seemed more interested in each other than to help out customers. I was told my Gluten Free Pizza with 3 toppings would take about 20 minutes, truth be told it took 40+ as my whole table was served their entire orders it seemed they forgot about mine until I had to get up and ask and at first they looked lost then said \"oh yeah it's coming right up.\" I get this is a bar but if it is also a restaurant you should be able to hold a conversation without having to yell because the music is BLARING. At the end of the day this place just seems to be really over priced and over hyped. Definitely will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for a slice around....!!! The other places downtown don't add up!! The environment here...classic Evel and it shows!! Fans show up!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick slice, waited for 30 minutes still didn't get a slice. The the guy behind the counter decided to tell my boyfriend and I to f off. We paid $12 and never got our pizza. I'd skip it unless you want to deal with complete jerks."}
{"text":"Evil Pie is my favorite pizza place in town if I'm going for a slice. A crispy dough with just the right amount of sauce and a super delicious topping combo. Very cool atmosphere for a slice (or 2 in my case) and a drink with friends.  I can't wait to go back when I'm in the downtown area."}
{"text":"They have an ORIGINAL Evil Knievel pinball machine!!!!!!! They also have some KILLER pizza!!!! This place has an off the charts cool factor going for it, I watched Knievel break every bone in his body flying over shit on his Harley when I was a kid, so this place brought back ALOT of good memories!!!! I'd DEFINATELY return!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town. Perfectly set in the heart of Las Vegas. If you happen to stop by this place dont forget to check out the back. Many of times there will be an awesome live band playing or a pop up show. Everything is well thought out there from the little trinkets on the walls, to the entertainment, to every drop of pizza sauce spread so evenly. The atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly. You can feel like you around family even though you are amougst strangers. Its warm and lively all the time."}
{"text":"A very good pie.. taste like I was back in New York. Awesome pie shop with a full bar. Evel knievel theme. Badd ass!"}
{"text":"PIZZA! On Fremont in Vegas! SO GOOD and totally affordable, but price should not be an issue when it comes to good 'za (however, non-chain yummy food that doesn't bust your wallet is so great to find in Vegas!). The sauce is great, the crust is PERFECT, and for those who want it, there is a gluten free  option plus a vegan pie.  The Cheesy Rider showcases Evel Pei's pizza making skills, and showcases the sauce and crust with just the right amount of cheese. Barry White Pie--I love a white pie and this is glorious, balanced and nuanced. The World Famous Snake River Special has rattlesnake sausage (yum!), and OMG! they have man candy bacon as a topping on the Hog Heaven, and you can get it as a extra topping for other pies or slices.  They serve beer and shots as well as sodas, are open late late and freaking ROCK!"}
{"text":"Dont be fooled with the good looking pictures, infortunafely the pizzas are overpriced and super thin aside from being untasty and over salted. Need I ad the service is not great. I order two slices and in the glass theu look so great, however its just the crust that looks thick, when you get your pizza, its pretty sad.. the pizza is thin and small but the outer cruat is huge. Its like a scam lol.. its fremont.. what do you expect I guess.."}
{"text":"If you're a pizza nut like me, but just turned Vegan!!! This is it right here.  Just had their Vegan pie and it was amazing, incredible flavor, texture and taste. Vegan cheese is not what I expected. It was awesome. I'll be dreaming about this for a while.  There are many combinations to choose from. With or without vegan cheese, olive, jalapeño, mushroom, roasted pepper, onion, peppadew, pineapple etc. I highly recommend this pizza.  On week 6 of being Vegan, and this will be my new vice when it comes to a pizza craving.  Wow, double wow!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place to go into, service is pretty good it's loud and the pizza is OK but very bland.  This is typical pizza place at any other vegas gimmick location evel, but the pizza is just pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza is bomb. Kat is the coolest fricking bartender ever. You can walk in and get whatever she recommends. You're in good hands at 3:45am"}
{"text":"Loud music  Too much on the walls People talking on high volume  AND THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!  What do you expect your in Downtown Vegas   Great service  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This hipster-as-fuck pizza joint slash bar just opened on Fremont street with a vintage Evel Knievel theme, and they put out some some pretty good slices! Checked this spot out with a friend from NYC and she couldn't stop at one slice, it was that good. The crust is thin yet retains a nice crunch, the cheese is generous, and the sauce actually has flavor. Pair it with a beer for a $5 combo, and you're hard pressed to find a cheaper meal in the area, let alone one that's actually good! I'll be back for the Balls to the Wall pie!"}
{"text":"I like this place most definitely. If you're downtown it's worth checking out. It has great service and food. Has a full bar and fun atmosphere. Even if it's really busy which it can get the wait still isn't even that bad. I will probably be back there soon"}
{"text":"New place, just opened a few weeks ago. Great pizza and beer. I mean what else do u really need?! Fun, friendly staff. Open late and even later on weekends. Cool retro decor for my 70s babies. RIP Evel Knievel"}
{"text":"The first slice I ordered as a a test was the pepperoni.  Crispy delicious crust and perfect balance of cheese and toppings.    I need to be satisfied with another slice.  I looked up at their menu and saw \"Balls to the wall.\"  How can I not order that for a try?    Mozzarella balls.  Meat balls.  And a touch of basil.  a great combo of balls.  Love it.    There's a great variety of beers on tap too.  From local LV to San Diego craft brews.   If you're on Fremont street and need a break from the street performers,  drop by for a slice and a brew.  You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"We've been to Fremont Street seven times and I'm so glad that we finally stumbled upon this place! We came in for lunch and they have one of the best deal on food here. We each got a huge slice for only $5 (we got the all-meat one) and it kept us filled until dinner. We almost got a whole pie for around $28 and it comes with 8 huge slices and I'm glad that we didn't. There was no way we could've finished that. It would've been a great deal if we stayed close or if we had dinner there because leftover pizza are always good for breakfast. The Diet Coke comes with free refills. My teen son did get a bit \"shocked\" when he tried to use the men's restroom. I had to take him to the women's restroom with me. It still had the same graffiti covered grunge look and a bit dark."}
{"text":"Very awesome!! We went here for a slice and was really awesome inside with Evel Knievel Decor inside all over the walls and Pinball machine!   The pizza was good and made to order and with two slices and two beers only 17.00 dollars.  Very busy inside . Cool place to grab a quick bite !!"}
{"text":"My friend doesn't eat gluten, so we ordered the gluten free. It takes 30 minutes and comes in 6 thick small rectangular pieces. It was surprisingly good, it thought it was going to be dry but it was moist and had a nice crunch. The dough seemed to be made out of rice? Anyways pretty good stuff. $30 for it too so it's not for everyone"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place, it was our favourite new find on our latest trip to Las Vegas. Awesome slices, cool spot, friendly staff, incredible music and the most amazing collection of Evel Kneivel memorabilia. This will be a must every time we hit Vegas from now on. Well done, Evel Pie!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Gluten free pizza in Vegas with a homemade crust!  It's a thick Chicago style crust that's infused with cheese, you would never know it's gluten free! The only drawback is the price, it was 52 dollars for two small pizza's. I would get it again but next time maybe just one and a salad with it to offset the price. It's sad for me to go into the shop and see the display of amazing pizza's they have with a slice as big as your arm for 5 bucks and not be able to eat whatever I like since I have a gluten issue, however I am grateful for the amazing pizza there that's Gluten free."}
{"text":"The guys that brought us Golden Tiki did it again! Love this 70's themed pizza pie joint.  Laid back atmosphere..great food..greater specials (beer and a slice for $5!)  The meatballs were great!  My husband I went there before a night downtown and it was the perfect place.  Not only did they have beer and wine, but a full bar.  Yes, please!  We have both worked in the service industry and, even though it was a busy Friday night, were greeted by a happy staff that didn't seem a bit flustered.  If you are downtown and are craving pizza or Italian..this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"pizza was good, the girls at the bar were friendly and not stand offish or bitchy, as well as the cashier very nice! BUUTTTT...the later it gets in the night the more the creeps come out and drunk people stumbling inside rubbing against you at the bar its very annoying, very easily someone can get popped, i see why there was security at the door now."}
{"text":"I can tell you that I am a pizza snob. I hate most pizza because it's an abomination of breadlike substance with crap on top. Walking down Fremont I saw this place and it reminded me of my favorite pizza place. Popped in and grabbed a pepperoni. Destroyed the slice and ordered a Balls to the Walls (meatballs pepperoni and stuff?) immediately. Delicious. The crust is crisp without being heavy, which is IMO the most important part of pizza. If you want pizza in Vegas, come here no question."}
{"text":"We ate here last night.  The Maui wowie was delicious! My only complaint would be the cashier issues.  We knew there was a slice and a beer $6 special, but did not know it was only for plain cheese, and she didn't explain that either. We had to go over our order with her again and get refunded and re-rang, to achieve the proper order.  Everything was fine beyond that."}
{"text":"As a native NY'er I was skeptical about the pizza, but wow did evel satisfy my thin crust pizza hunger! Kat is an amazing bartender and I highly recommend coming here for a beer and slice."}
{"text":"I went in a few months back on a Friday night. Ordered 2 slices of pizza and 2 sodas. Was pretty sure the girl who took my order heard me but when I got my ordered it was only 1 slice and 1 soda. I told her she was missing my other slice and soda and then she told me that I only ordered 1 slice. I told her I was looking right at you when you took my order, look at the receipt, why is it 14 dollars for only 1 slice? Since the receipt orders don't tell you what you ordered they could easily tell you to order and pay again. Which I think is really odd for a restaurant to not have what the customer ordered on the receipt. Overall the people here were really disrespectful, and you can barely hear or talk to them with the music blasting right in your ear and the megaphone with the next ready order blasting in your ear as well. I told the pizza cooks also that I was missing a pizza and they seemed really hostile like they wanted to fight me cause I was telling them how they messed my order up and how inconvenient it is that I have to pay and order again. Pizza was so dry, there is no customer service here, this place is truly evil!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was decent.  I think the names and the interesting toppings generally sound better then they actually are.  It's not bad but I didn't think it was great either.  There is a lot of evil kenieval photos on the wall to keep you entertained while you eat."}
{"text":"I like it! The theme, the people, the Pizza... all good. My one issue is the price per slice but hey, supply and demand right? I sorely miss Uncle Joe's Pizza that used to be near this spot, but the slices here are very close. Authentic New York style slightly crunchy cheesy goodness. Also you never know who you'll see here! It's just as much a locals spot as it is for Fremont tourists. Give it a go and get yourself two slices of cheese or pepperoni to test the waters."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite pizza shops but the quality has gone down tremendously in the last six months I was in there this weekend and yes I know it was a crazy busy weekend but that's no excuse for pizza so paperthin that you cannot pick it up and put in your mouth without it falling on your shirt. I love the ambience and I love the vibe but I love pizza even more so get it together please"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and just tried it recently. I love that Evel Pie is a locally owned business and promotes sustainable business practices - buy local! I also love that you have a choice of gluten free crust that is amazing. That said :) my favorite pizza is the Goblin Sausage - it's amazing."}
{"text":"Super cool dive bar and pizzeria mixed in one. There's so much to see as far as decorations, bumper stickers, and there are knickknacks all over the wall that is hard to get bored here. My only complaint is that the beers were a bit overpriced. Paying eight dollars for a small draft beer seems a little steep, but that is to be expected given the area and that it is Las Vegas. Pizza slices started at $5.50 which is high too. The bartender was super friendly and accommodating, and a lot of the sample a few beers before actually selecting the one we wanted to drink. I think what I like most about this place is that is just such a funky establishment was so many different things all over the place to look at and that is right up my alley."}
{"text":"Live hard, ride fast, eat pizza is their slogan! A fun tribute to Evel Knievel!   This place is a lot of fun and has a dive bar feel to it with great lunch & happy hour specials! It's loud in every way from the decor to the music.   The pizza is great and my favorite is the hog heaven with BBQ sauce, smoked mozzarella, fontina, pulled pork, man candy bacon, red onions and fresh parsley. Every bite is delicious!   There are lots of pizza variations and everything is good from the classic pepperoni to the rattlesnake sausage one!   I love coming here for a quick bite and we always have a good time! Service is friendly and it's a great addition to downtown LV."}
{"text":"Good Pizza but tourist trap. Really expensive and they are not by any chance hospitable."}
{"text":"Went here for pizza.....  god awful noise from the back terrace caused me to leave... I won't be back.   If you are going to hire a band you need to pay more.   Sorry... I expected more from the business!"}
{"text":"Duuuuuude. Great pizza. Great people. Awesome sauce. And fast!! Absolutely perfect for late night bites."}
{"text":"This bar turned our Vegas experience around completely. Kelly is an amazing bartender. Place has a very unique and comfy vibe. Friendliest staff we've met so far. Drinks aren't shorted on alcohol, definitely a place where you get what you pay for and worth every penny."}
{"text":"The only question you need to ask is: \"Would Evel Knievel, the Man, the ultimate Badass, actually come here for pizza and a beer if he were still here?\"  Yes.  This is NOT a fake, kitschy Las Vegas tourist trap, rather the excellent pizza, the ice cold beer, the loud music and genuine friendly people who work here make this place real and truly worthy of their namesake.   The perfect combination of sauce and cheese sit on top of an impossibly thin crust and easily make this one of best NY style slices I've ever had.  All of the Evel Knievel memorabilia is the \"topping\" on what is already a nearly perfect \"pie\"  Go, and enjoy the beer, the pizza and the cool Evel stuff."}
{"text":"Maybe I should've ordered pizza from here instead... We ordered Caesar salad, garlic knots, and wings. The salad was tiny for $7. The garlic knots had no flavor, it was basically plain buns with some oil dumped on it, could not taste the garlic. The wings were basic and didn't have much sauce. Overall, I was underwhelmed by this, and disappointed due to all the great reviews. None of the items really stood out, it was all pretty average and forgettable."}
{"text":"Came across this pizza place by way of site seeing off the strip. OMG!! What a refreshing and fun atmosphere from the normal (if there is a normal). The staff - Very friendly, Very inviting, The Drinks- my skinny Margarita was great, hubby had a great Beer selection, The Food - the pizza by the slice looked yummy! Hubby being Gluten Free, decided to share with him. HANDS DOWN BEST GF PIZZA WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST 5 YEARS! GF's it's a must!! You will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I was walking along Fremont Street and stumbled into here. $6 bucks for a piece of cheese pizza and a house beer; not bad for Vegas! Wasn't the best pie or beer I ever had but hey, it's six bucks and ready in two minutes in a chill bar with a great atmosphere and good music at midnight on a Monday night. Not really much to complain about!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but all my reviews are 5-star reviews (except for a post office review) because I don't like coming on here unless I have something positive to say, but my experience was pretty bad and  I had to vent.    Took about 90 minutes at a very odd hour.  That would have been fine if the pizza had been worth it.  But this was some of the worst pizza I've ever had, and I'm pretty easy to please.  It wasn't even really edible.  Most of the outside of each square was burnt to a crisp.  It was so hard that it basically just shattered in my mouth.  My tooth kills now -- gee, thanks a lot.    And if that weren't enough, the middle part didn't even seem cooked.  It looked and tasted like raw dough that was insanely greasy.  I'm not sure how one manages to burn half of it until it's a black brick, yet the inside looks like it wasn't cooked at all?  Maybe the person who made it was new?  I hope so!  I washed my hands and still haven't gotten the grease off them.  The only reason I didn't give this a one is because I DID like the flavor of the toppings.   If the cheese and toppings were on a different pizza -- one that wasn't a combo of a brick and total mush, then I'd be just fine.   Other than that, not a happy camper.  Waited a long time just to throw it away."}
{"text":"Better pizza than regular pizza. This is the ONLY spot you should be going to near Fremont st. Actually, just leave the strip, because reasons, and head straight to this place, you won't regret it.   Also the cosmopolitan sucks. The food gear is so much better."}
{"text":"Was in yesterday and the service was awesome. Bree & Donna sure know how to take care of their customers.   Awesome ambience! Fun atmosphere! Clean facility! Food is amazing- see pic attached-Great recommendations from the girls!  Drinks are awesome and they are always on top of it before your drink is finished    Can't wait to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"We've been three times since moving here in July and we live out in the Lone Mountain area. This place has the greatest pizza! Hog Heaven and Barry White are amazing!! The atmosphere may throw a few folks off at first but the people are great. Super friendly staff and great food. Never judge a book by its cover and don't judge this place either!  A must try for locals and tourists especially since it's just off the Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every time I come here I have great customer service and the food is great! Tarell is extremely nice and my favorite bartender around! Chanse was very helpful and very polite, he refilled my drinks and took care of me very well. I will always return here!"}
{"text":"Soggy pizza. I have eaten here before and it was good but they are slipping tonight.......disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome place for pizza & ambiance! Very chill! They have vegan options also! Check it out."}
{"text":"Rattlesnake pizza and the Barry White pizza are a must try.    Cute little pizza joint - pizza is amazing and made hot and fresh.    Only complaint is the lady working the counter overcharged me by over $6... when I brought it to her attention, she gave no apology and seemed annoyed that she has to fix."}
{"text":"One of our friends was staying at the Cortez and stumbled into this place one night and then made us return with him the next day...  sausage goblin pizza Barry white pizza Balls to the wall  Pepperoni  Cheese  They were all great .. it's like $6 for a speciality slice .. the Barry white was my personal favorite   Great little restaurant and bar .. amazing pizza .. great customer service . Cool things on the wall to look at great people watching windows   They do not allow outside drinks in at night and they do serve a full bar and free water by the door .."}
{"text":"Dedicated to evel himself. They have a great beer and a slice special for 6$. People are friendly, staff is friendly. The pizza is really good. Definitely a must for Fremont street."}
{"text":"Don't know how this place got 4.5 stars. Soggy pizza you can't pick up and eat without bending it in 1/3's. The environment is cool, beer is expensive. From my vast pizza eating experience, this pizza sucks. Sorry EP, clean up your pizza act and quit giving your customers pizza crap when you have massive profit margins.  Edit & Response:   Yes Branden, I couldn't wait to get home and slam your crappy pizza. If it was killer, I would have told the world your \"award winning\" pizza was killer. It wasn't so I call it like I eat it. I won't fall for your bullying, sarcastic, intimidating type comments. The only reason you have so many customers is your location and ease of service. In response to your super price deals, no one informed me of that deal. If they did I would have tried it.   I hope you have a better day as well.  & I hope your pizza standards come up, or I was there on an \"off\" day perhaps.  ***ANOTHER  edit because the owner can't accept that her pizza TOTALLY SUCKS. Hey Jacka** FYI your pizza is crap and you know it.  For an owner your attitude sucks, along with your pizza. Beat it clown  Another OWNER CLOWN EDIT.... Owner calls me a joke and tells me he posted my review on his FaceBook account and hundreds of people are laughing at me. Wow I'm glad I'm so funny. Your additional comments are making you a Joke, you know your a clown because a reputable business owner wouldn't even come close to the clowning remarks you have. Your a CLOWN dude. Your a joke fool. If you didn't spend so much time criticizing people maybe your pizza would be half way decent."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place let's see first staff is awesome the owner even more awesome the pizza even more awesome than that!!! If you're into hanging out eating pizza drinking a cold beer and taking up company that's  awesome and little Rowdy type of people, this is the place for you my friends! whether you're a local are here visiting are awesome City take the time to stop in say hello and get you a slice of that pizza and a cold beer to go!"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA NEXT TO A TOURISTY AREA (Warning: visitors from Central Florida in for a vacation) Despite all the quirky Evel Knievel décor, I immediately liked the look of this place because it seemed familiar somehow- like it was something I'd see back in Central Florida. Or maybe I was just seeking any calm away from Fremont Street.  BIG NEW YORK STYLE SLICES I took a slice topped with pepperoni and jalapenos while Hubs wanted one topped with multiple types of meat. Our slices arrived with a pool of oil on top from the cheese and limp from the size... but we already knew this wasn't gourmet pizza. This was diner pizza- comfortable and flavorful. The price was also great.  ORDER AT THE COUNTER AND THEY'LL REHEAT There were about a dozen varieties of pizza on display. We chose what we wanted and they'd reheat and serve it to us in our seats. Next to us was a long bar full stocked. The entire vibe of the place was very chill. A little dark. It reminded me of an old city pizzeria."}
{"text":"I stopped into Evel Pie with some friends during my visit to Vegas this past week and was impressed. After wandering around Fremont building up an appetite, we looked around at a few options and decided that pizza sounded good.  With the cool exterior and punk rock music coming from inside we knew it'd be a unique place.  There's Evel memorabilia all around and interesting people. The girl that took the order was polite and friendly and they even went out of their way to make us micheladas which I know is not very normal for a pizza place.  They actually had some kind of local lime beer though and it turned out really tasty.  The bartender clearly knew what was up and it went great with pizza.  As far as slices, I'd say this is very good pizza, with great crust and quality cheese. I got a version of a hawaiian pizza with japenos which made me wonder why no one has ever made this before.  Great combo.  My date got some kind of \"Barry White\" pizza which she said was really good.  She is very picky about pizza and never offered me a bite AND ate all her crust which she never does so that really told me something.  Overall I loved the ambiance, decor and vibe and will definitely be coming back when I'm downtown.  It's a quick and fun way to refuel on your adventures that is also affordable."}
{"text":"we actually walked in and didn't understand the concept so we walked back out. we came back later and had awesome pizza and drinks for really cheap. the staff here were so down to earth and just overall great people. they really made that night special for us. we went other places and received horrible or rude service like everyone working on or near the strip in Vegas is just completely over life. this place is FIRE. You have for skip a place or two and stop by here.  worth it!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. This place will close soon. Pizza has been sitting out for hours hi how touched it to put into warmer bare handed. Not impressed. Wouldn't go back ever even if we are hamm"}
{"text":"I love this place. Cool customers. Open late at night. Great pizza. The device is really good too! They even have gluten free. A Vegas must!"}
{"text":"I finally made it into Evel Pie recently - and that place is great. Super fun/cool vibe, decore & staff. Plus there was a band rockin out on the back patio that was solid, so I got lucky with that!  Price is a bit more than I usually pay for a slice of pizza, but that's how it is with cool bars/restaurants, right? Few extra coins for the atmosphere.  I definitely would like to return sometime with friends, get a whole pie (or a few) and some beers and kick it there. Great place for a photo/video location, too - in case anyone could use that."}
{"text":"Awesome place and food  Service was fast n friendly ! Will definitely be back when we visit Vegas again!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, and wonderful pizza!  The drinks were good, and cheaper than the strip.  The service was good and the music and decor was fun"}
{"text":"Evil Pie is a nice inexpensive way to escape the crazy Fremont St. I ordered a Beer and a slice of Balls to the Wall, meatballs, ricotta cheese, and sausage. It was served hot and very good after a long day of Roller Derby. The Beer was cold and it was a funky place to hang out with my girlfriends. I knew it would be a good place, after all it is the brain child of Brandon Powers, creator and operator of The Golden Tiki. If you only have 10 bucks and want to have a fun nostalgic experience with Evel Knievel, then this is your spot. LIVE FREE AND RIDE FAST!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Great atmosphere. Super central location on Fremont Street. My kids loved it. Good pizza and people watching."}
{"text":"I've never left a review before but this place deserves some recognition. Amazing value pizza and massive servings. Great beer, great atmosphere! I wish there was a place like this where I lived"}
{"text":"Great pizza place off strip near Freemont Street. $5 for slice of cheese and a PBR. Can't beat it. I would recommend to anyone trying to save their money for the tables."}
{"text":"We happened to stumble into this pizza place while we were enjoying Fremont. This is literally the best pizza I've ever had! We had the Hawaiian with jalapeños (forgot the name) and it was SO good! Delicious & good beer. Loved the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Evel Pie has the best pizza in Vegas! The crust is crisp tasty sauce and tons of toppings, friendly service from the staff (who all have awesome tattoos!)plus a great assortment of beers... and plenty of Evel Knievel memorabilia to look at while you eat. Punk rock attitude and a fun atmosphere makes this one of my favorite places to go whenever I am in Sin City."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza! Thin crust, nicely browned on the bottom, great toppings and cold beer! Great pie at a tourist mecca, who would believe..."}
{"text":"Nice casual pizza place.  I tried the rattlesnake sausage pizza with a local beer.  Nice oily thin pizza.  Atmosphere is great and relaxing."}
{"text":"Pizza is so-so but the beer and alcohol selection is everything. The service is always on point and friendly. This is also a great place to sit back and people watch. The world takes all kinds, right ?   Get the grapefruit beer if you're feeling adventurous.. I loved it !!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza joint in town!! I thought the cheese was so delicious and its stretchy and delicious and I want it right now! The service is pretty good for downtown, considering the hipster vibe of the place. You get what you pay for, as far as quality, it was 5.50 for a medium slice but it was so worth it! I recommend getting two slices if you are hungry.  They have a nice selection of beers, fancy and non fancy and a couple of generic wine options. Its definitely a must do if you are in the down town area. You know what?? stop by even if you have to go out of your way, it is well worth it. Way better than the cosmopolitans over hyped \"hidden pizza wedge\" or whatever the hell its called."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I'm a pizza snob. I've eaten at pizza rock and it was decent. I've eaten pizza at Cosmo and it was great. But I think this is the best pizza I've had in Vegas. Also, my girlfriend is gluten intolerant. I've taken bites of her gluten free pizzas from other places and it all tasted like cardboard. The gluten free stuff here actually tasted pretty freaking good. Like I would have no problem eating it. Great N.Y. style pizza and a great atmosphere. This place makes every other pizza place feel like a pizza hut."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice and was told it would take 10 minutes. After 30 minutes the person waiting ahead of us is already dismayed and rightfully so.    I've worked back of the house for over a decade and the staff were below incompetent. They looked at the slips like they were written in code by Stephen Hawking.    After 40 minutes the staff were actually hostile to the person ahead of us and our party as well when they were questioned about the timeliness of the slices.  And I'm not exaggerating with the word hostile.  I mean seriously. Put a slice in the oven. Then hand it to the customer.  Get a clue.    It's also not advisable to tell the customer to 'fuck off'.  The girl taking our order was awesome though.  Please don't lump her in with the incompetence of the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Pizza comes out very hot, so take that time listening to the awesome music and checking out all of the great decorations. Small seating area, but very clean and comfortable. We tried pepperoni, cheese, and goblin sausage and they were all excellent. Lots of flavor-from the fresh dough, the nicely seasoned sauce, and the fresh high quality ingredients. You can taste the love put in every pie!"}
{"text":"This is the best most amazing pizza ever. They used the best sauce and they also have gluten free options which is nice. Very cool location when you come to vegas ,loved the decor . My husband loved the beer selection and the prices , next time we are in Vegas we will have to make another stop here ."}
{"text":"Love this place. seedy vibe, 70s memorabilia and the pizza was incredible. Would come again"}
{"text":"Evel Pie is that nostalgic, greasy pizza slice served in a non-pretentious environment. You order at the counter, find a seat, and wait for your name to be called signifying that your pizza is hot and toasty. Slices run $4-6 a piece, and although we ordered one per person, I probably could have devoured two for dinner.   The had some basic slices (cheese, sausage, pepperoni) and some interesting creations (hog heaven: candied bacon, BBQ, sausage, ham & mystery slices). It was a nice easy place to stop, and I can easily see why they keep steady customers.   Was it the absolute best pizza ever? Nope. But it was easy enough to fill a craving."}
{"text":"Thank god we found this place. We have been going once a week for some pizza and beer! The place is a total throw back... brings me right back to my childhood. MUST GO!!"}
{"text":"I was wandering around Fremont street and stumbled upon this place. Very cool casual spot with lots of seating. I got a slice of the Goblin Sausage and my first thought was, why is it so greasy?! I mean, I know it's pizza but it was a lot more than I am used to having so after using tons of napkins to dab some of that grease off, I was excited to bite into this thing. It is a meat lover's dream filled with pepperoni, ham, italian sausage and bacon. It was hot but was a bit on the soggy side. However, it had just the right amount of cheese and sauce. I would go back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent pizza! I come here every single time I am in Vegas. I just purchased 2 slices for when I wake up in the morning and catch my flight home to pizza deprived Tampa, Florida."}
{"text":"****Update****  Branden reached out to my wife and I, and graciously invited us back to try the gluten free pie. And I must say, for someone who isn't gluten free, I really did enjoy it. But most importantly my wife, who is gluten sensitive, REALLY enjoyed it, and that's what truly matters. I have to say Branden, and the staff there truly went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our return visit.   Myself, I tried the meatballs for an appetizer, and a slice of cheese. Both very good. The marinara on the meatballs was out of this world good!    Thanks again Branden, and staff at Evel Pie!!  You truly understand the meaning of exceptional customer service, and you gained customers for life with your willingness to reach out the way you did, and as quickly as you did. You truly have a gift when it comes to pizza making (I consider it art!!) and your talent really shows."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Cool atmosphere. Definitely a cool stop while down on Fremont street. Check out the back bar. It is a hidden area that is a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"We gave this place another try, the staff that was there was absolutely fantastic. Much better experience and the gluten-free pizza is the bomb.com. Shout outs to everyone there this past Saturday and we will be back. 100%"}
{"text":"If you like 70's motorcycle culture, you'll be happy.  Otherwise, it's just mediocre pizza by the slice at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"One bite, everyone knows the rules. 7.8/10 - good NY style pizza. Cool spot in downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"Great pizza and they have a slice and a beer special for $6 all the time.  There are about 10 different pizzas and maybe 8 craft beers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place downtown I can enthusiastically recommend to people! (Sorry radio city pizza fans I was not impressed) serving pizza by the slice and pie this place is great and open late. Nothing in Vegas can recreate New York pizza (mostly because of the water, but there are other reasons too) this comes damn close. A nice greasy slice, that's thin enough to fold and eat New York style. It's a neat Evel Kneivel theme as well with all sorts of interesting decor. Looking forward to trying the rattlesnake sausage and man candy( a maple ham and pepper mix). Say hi to bartender Kelly if you go by, she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a great Vegan pizza. Cheese was really delightful and the sauce was tangy sweet. Try this place out if you're vegan."}
{"text":"What a jewel pie. Perfect crust....toppings are too die for......yummy sponge and chewy cheese..."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good. Great service. Pizza had been taking long but came over to check on us and apologized for Inconvenience with a pitcher of beer and salad. Pizza came out shortly and was amazing. Definitely a great place to come and eat. Would recommend to come here"}
{"text":"First of all the place is so freakin cute! Dedicated to the amazing Evil Kenivel there is memorabilia everywhere and super fun decor to fit the fun style. Second, located in the best part of downtown vegas it's the perfect place to go after you have had a few drinks and need to soak up some of the \"fun\" you have had. And third, the pie is so freakin good!! Of course they have your normal toppings but take a chance and try the rattlesnake pizza! Yummy yummy yummy!! This is a must try for locals and tourists alike, I promise you won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"Very funky atmosphere; fun . Seating is limited so be prepared to stand outside at the bar tables and people watch. The pizza is phenomenal and very well priced. Highly recommend the \"Balls to the Wall\" slice"}
{"text":"We love this place; this is our go-to place every time in Vegas. With the many pizza options available on Fremont Street (and I've tried all of them--from the little shops to the restaurant types), this is the choice you need to make.   The pizza is consistent, a wide selection of alcohol to choose from and a great ambiance!  The pepperoni pizza has a thin crust with a good ratio of sauce to cheese and meat. Sometimes a little greasy but, nothing a napkin could drain.  The staff are friendly and the Evel Knieval memorabilia is a plus."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Perfect for when drinking on Fremont.  Barry White is my fave slice here.  Toppings can be a bit sparse.  I think I had 3 tiny pepperoni on my slice.  Food comes out quick even when busy and ordering more than slices.  Service is friendly.  They have a full bar which is nice.   Prices are a little high.  We spent almost $40 on 3 slices and 12 wings that includes tip.  If in a group better to spring for a whole pie.  If sober I would head down to Pizza Rock."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but Evel is really only worth it when they're running the slice and a beer special I think. Prices are a normal for by the slice but normal for by the slice is kinda high. For a dollar or two more than you pay by the slice you can get a large Brooklyn style 3-topping pizza at Dominos or something. Plus for some reason everyone they ever have at the register seems to be too busy to take your order unless it's Friday or Saturday night.  Come here if you're out on Fremont at night on the weekend, otherwise you're gonna pay $17 for two pieces of pizza and a bud light and feel kinda jipped. But for the times they are running that special and have the staff around because they know they'll be busy, it's a good place to grab a piece of pizza and a beer."}
{"text":"Super awesome decor and really fun staff! They even offer a beer and a slice of cheese pizza for $5!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing!!! Tried pepperoni, Barry white and the Hawaiian one, all delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. -Great location on Fremont street. -Decent prices, 5 bucks for a slice & a Pint. -Pizza ins't great but it is good. -Dining area & Bar are clean. -Good beer selection. -Great music selection playing. -Evel Knievel Theme & decor. -Excellent atmosphere. -Friendly staff. I'll definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Cooooooolllllllll. The vibe in this place is super fun and all decked out with evil knievil decor! Being from New York, I take my pizza seriously and this place did a great job. The crust was thin with a crunch on the bottom. The sauce was well seasoned and flavorful. Great amount of cheese and completely melted! Yum yum yum! We ordered a large to go after eating some in the store!!"}
{"text":"This place is fricking awesome. I was tripping balls on shrooms and stumbled into this place. I told the door guy I was lit af and dying of heat. He sat my ass under a fan with an epic view of all that happens on fremont. Not all heros wear capes, this doorman saved my ass!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had In a really long time. Cool environment. The pizza was very fresh and really affordable. I will definitely go back when in town."}
{"text":"Great, unique atmosphere dedicated to Evel Knevel. The pizza is so delish and a great late night meal.  Yummy choices for meat lovers and animal lovers."}
{"text":"Love this place. Right downstairs. The people are great. The food us even better. They stay open until 4:20am on the weekends! Hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped in for beers during a hot day on Fremont Street. This is a divey, hipster, Evel Knievel themed bar that is worth checking out. Their beer selection was great. We really enjoyed sitting in a booth with our beers and checking out the decor on the walls- so much cool stuff to see. They are also famous for their pizza. I wish I had been hungry at the time, because I would have loved to have tried it! The flavors looked so cool and I loved the unique names. Really unique bar! I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy yumz yumt yum! Slices are huge. Taste is superb! Hits. Thee. Spot. Hands down the best pizza in Vegas. Around $5 or so for a slice with a topping, $24 for a 20inch cheese. Fantastic!  Not much seating room but wasn't a long wait before snagging a table. Great decor paying homage to Evel himself. Glad I'm local so I can be back."}
{"text":"So i'm a Vegas local and I've walked by this place a bunch of times but have never tried it. Tonight I finally gave into my pizza loving heart and decided to try this joint and boy am I glad I did. So this place is a pizza joint and dive bar that is dedicated to Evel Knievel and is adorned with shirts, stickers, pictures, etc all in the motorcycle riding rebel's honor. When you walk in you are greeted with an awesome bar, pinball machine (Evel Knievel themed of course), and some booths in the back. There are tons of flavors of pizza to try and tonight I opted for a couple of slices of the Goblin Sausage which is topped with sausage (duh), bacon, pepperoni, and all the gooey fatty cheese you could ever wish or dream to have. The dough is rolled right there in shop fresh from scratch and the pizza sauce is also made fresh so you know automatically the pizza is going to be more amazing than any Evel Knievel stunt. This place is surprisingly cheap with a slice of pizza running around 5 bucks (for my slice). A slice of plain cheese is probably cheaper but I ordered one with a good amount of toppings.    The service was phenomenal as well and I was treated more like family than a guy who just walked through the door. I felt so welcome here and felt as though I had been coming for years even though this was my first time. So now onto what you all care about which is how the pizza actually tasted. First off trust me when I say I've had a lot of pizza in my life, I've had cheap fast food style pizza and I've had overpriced 30 buck hipster pizza that is organic and tastes like van carpet. Let me tell you that no pizza I've ever had compares to how tasty Evel Pie is. I mean the crust isn't too crispy, the sauce is tangy and has the right amount of kick, the cheese is perfectly melted to where you get those little crispy parts in the middle, and the slices are nice and big New York style slices. You just can't find pizza this good anywhere else in the city and I've tried. They even run a deal where you can get a slice and a beer for 5 bucks in total. All in all I love Evel Pie and I will definitely 100% be coming back to this place whenever i'm craving a slice of pizza or when I wanna cheat on my diet. Great place for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place looking around Freemont Street. The Evel Knievel theme immediately brought me in. The pizza is pretty good and the place has a neat vibe. I enjoyed my visit. I got two different types of pizza and I liked both. I would return. They also have long hours so they are open for late night food."}
{"text":"Great place for an awesome slice of pizza.   Drinks were pretty good too!  Lots of cool memorabilia the check out for the old people who still remember who Evel Knievel is."}
{"text":"Had the chance to finally try this place out. It's been for a while and I've been interested in going but always seem to have something come up.  Came in here for their happy hour this week. This place has their happy hour from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm everyday. Pretty fantastic. Most places don't do a happy hour Friday through the weekend.  They had $3 drafts of Coors, PBR and Bud Light I believe as well as $4 wells. Didn't see any food specials though.  They did have a $5 slice of cheese and PBR.  Standard menu with some interesting toppings. Man candy (candies bacon) and rattle snake sauce definitely caught my eye.   I went ahead and got the traditional pepperoni. Like most of the by the slice joints, pizza is made before hand and they simply take a piece and heat it in the oven. Never been a fan of the pizza that's been sitting around for a while but this slice was pretty tasty. Thin crust and great sauce made this slice pretty epic.   They also have a salad option and a calzone as well. Staff is great. The vibe here was pretty amazing aw well. I believe the son of Evil Kinevil is one of the owners hence the shrine like set up behind the bar to the great daredevil.   Music is always on and the bartenders are pretty rocking too. Danny was new that night but she was definitely serving up good drinks and great vibes.   If you're looking for a cold beer and a decent slice in downtown then this is for sure the place to go."}
{"text":"Vegan vegan vegan (and live music) I went here for a few punk shows and was so impressed by the vegan options they offered! The vegan pizza can have vegan cheese or none, and they've got vegan meatballs they can cook up, too! The live music choices are sweet, and the staff is awesome. Definitely hit this place if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Came here by chance. Stumbled in not knowing what we getting ourselves into. THANK THE LORD WE DID! This place is absolutely amazing. Bellied up to the bar and immediately ordered a couple shots, met Sampson. Super cool guy, greeted us right away and made us feel right at home! We ended up ordering the gluten free option and it was amazing! For a spot that's only been open since November, it has that dive bar feeling. Such a blessing to  have found this hidden gem. Can't wait to come back! Thanks again Sampson the rest of the staff, you made our night!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. The decor and music were enjoyable. The staff was friendly. Prices a bit high. Alcoholic drinks are strong! Pinball game was fun."}
{"text":"Review update! Had one of the best late night moments last month. Four of us were in the booth right across from the pick-up zone and started clapping for our friend Ryan as he got his pizza, being cheeky & naturally stoked. Not only did the door guy stop on his way to the back to start clapping with us, but the entire restaurant started joining in cheering--many people taking things to the standing ovation level, some on their chairs--and finally the pizza chef gods and servers all started banging on the metal shelving and counter tops. It was a good solid 10 minutes of pure effing comedic glory & good times. So thanks Evel Pie, not just for filling my belly, but my damn soul! Great vibes, great staff, great environment."}
{"text":"Just about as close to NYC pie as you can get in the desert. Great staff. Be warned LOuD music. Very upbeat. Thumbs up. Evel Knievel decor. Great place for motor heads"}
{"text":"Best place! The owner Vince is the coolest guy. The pizza is great; the beer is great. They grow their herbs in the back on the patio. Been living in Vegas for 20 years and just found this spot. Will revisit when I come back to Fremont on a night out."}
{"text":"I had a blast. The bartenders and clientele were very friendly and the pizza is pretty good. Don't be afraid to duck in for a quick beer and a slice. You may end up hanging out for a while."}
{"text":"This is for the pizza by the slice. 1st of all, they consistently burn it. Looks great in the window then they burn a third of it. 2nd the part that's not burnt tastes mediocre at best. At over $4 a slice, I expect better quality, and I've gotten better quality at chain pizza places and the food courts at Sam's Club and costco. 3rd the service. I understand if you're busy. And I usually don't even talk about service in reviews. But when your actual food is bad and expensive (for what it is), then I don't know,  maybe I should expect you to give my pizza to someone else and make me wait even longer to burn my other slice.   Instead of here, go to Naked City Pizza. Better pizza,  better prices, better service. They're not speedy, but they're good. Maybe their interior isn't as well designed but that's all that's lacking"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Evel Pie. I like the theme and the feel of this place on Fremont St. The staff was all real nice even at 10PM.   I went in for their award winning gluten free pizza, because I heard it is amazing. I ordered, was told it'd be 20 minutes, but 30 minutes later I'm still waiting for my pie.   It wasn't busy, so I'm not sure why my pie sat on top of the oven for a while even though the person who took my order saw me stand up from the table getting a little impatient. I saw a pizza on top of the oven, thought it may be mine, so I slowly start inching towards the counter. Finally, someone asks if I was here for pickup and gave me the pie.   The crust is deep dish, airy, and it has that yummy browned cheese on the edges. Yup. To die for. The sauce is a little sweeter and herbaceous which I love, and it wasn't drowning in cheese which I really appreciated. Simple and to the point. The crust was a little greasy, but it is 10PM on Fremont St, so I wasn't expecting something healthy at that point.   Here's the thing. I don't expect pizza places to make an extra effort and have a gluten free crust. However, the fact that Evel Pie put a bunch of effort into making a stellar crust for those with a gluten free allergy is impressive, greatly appreciated, and pretty close to being worth the $21 for a plain cheese gluten free pizza. I'm even willing to look past the wait time. I would definitely suggest that people come and grab a bite here - gluten free or not."}
{"text":"$6 for a slice of pizza? Ya it's decent slice when you're drunk but you're really gonna charge that much for a slice of pepperoni!?"}
{"text":"Downtown, stumbling around and need a bite?   Check out Evel Pie. It's based on Evel Knievel and has some dope decorations. You may have to wait a while on the weekends but it is worth the wait. It's a pizza shop right on Fremont St. just west of LV Blvd. They serve pizza (of course), salads, wings, garlic knots, and meatballs. When I went to was slammed with First Friday going on and took a long time to place our order. They have slices starting at $4 and going up from there. They have a could different kinds of pizza. I went for the standard pepperoni for my first time. They also have a white pizza, vegan, and some others. Once we placed the order we got the pizza pretty fast. They call out your name on a mic. It was hot and ready to go in my mouth. I devoured the slice in seconds. I should have ordered some extras because I was hungry but alas we continued on your drunken path."}
{"text":"Best  in downtown Vegas must try when ur out kicking it and zip lining. Drinks are so fat and the service is amazing"}
{"text":"Evelly Delicious!!!  We were walking around Fremont on a very busy Saturday night, a semi decent band was scheduled to play on the main drag so the place was poppin.  We stopped at my favoriate outside bar which is located at the Golden Nugget and ordered some very large cocktails.  We did the loop around Fremont, and once we got towards the end we decided to grab something to eat.    Spoke with the bouncer at the door and he said we could seat ourselves.  Luckily they sale their pizza by the slice, so I ordered 10 slices of different varieties (For 5 people) and we waited a bit for it to be warmed up.  Evel Pie is pretty hipsterish, and it was certainly busy but we were able to find a seat.  We probably waited a total of ten (10) minutes and our slices were ready.    It may have been the booze talking, but this is some delicious friggen pizza.  Everyone pretty much devoured whatever I ordered no questions asked.  Thin crust, great flavors and just solid goodness and not too greasy.  Definitely very close to NYC pizza, and probably the best I have ever had while in Vegas.  Definitely make this place a pit stop to re-fuel, and get something in your belly to compete with all the booze.  Even if you don't drink and are in the area, you better stop by and get a slice you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Weird how when you order pizza at 2:00 in the morning you forget to take a picture of the pie! Huge slices, great prices, decent pizza on Fremont Street. The decor caught my eye and the pizza has a unique flavor. The piece I had didn't have a traditional sauce but was still pretty good. However, the server was kind of sarcastic and it rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza joints I have ever had. Get the white pizza. Calzones are really goof"}
{"text":"Thank you Lindsey!! Great service Great pizza Great meatballs Great jager Whole staff was cool! Local. Will return of course."}
{"text":"Evel Pie hits the spot, any time of day! Fun vibe inside, normally possible to find (or share) a table. Must try these slices, they're the best that it gets as far as affordable, slice-by-slice, and often late-night pizza goes."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the shirts they sell here. Plus, the pizza is pretty damn good.   Evel Pie is the new Evel Knievel-themed dive bar and pizza place on Fremont Street, the walls are covered in \"Evel\" memorabilia, and the bar t-shirts and hats are great 70's styled throwbacks. Not like the normal cheesy Vegas gear, stuff I would actually be proud to wear.   I was here on a weekday at noon, and it was dead, but I see how this place could get packed and loud on Friday and weekend nights. I went with two slices, the White Pie with Garlic, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Basil and Black Pepper and a slice of the Hog Heaven pie with BBQ Pulled Pork, Bacon, and Onions.   Both slices were amazing; The White Pie was rich and full of flavor, and the crust added some great texture, crunch after crunch. The Pulled Pork Pie was a pig lover's dream, covered in pulled pork and bacon. Crunchy crust, cheese, pulled pork, bacon. I'm dead.   They offer a daily $5 beer and slice deal for happy hour, score! Coming to DT? Evel Pie is a must stop."}
{"text":"Pizza wise and environment, it was amazing. Got the mystery slice and it was delicious. But im also a crust guy and it was just too plain and doughy. Other than that though, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First of all I am a Montana native and of the age where Evel Knievel has a huge impact on my childhood so the memories placed on the walls here are fantastic. Also they have Oly Beer and Hamms Beer which I have not seen in years. Awesome!! Now for the pizza...it is really good and maybe the best pizza I have had since moving to Las Vegas 4 years ago. The staff is friendly and helpful, the place is a very cool place to have a pizza, a few drinks and hangout. Oh yes...the music they play is always great and makes the atmosphere here even better.."}
{"text":"Nice quick bite. Tried many of the varieties of pies over the years and all were good. Good selection of beer, macro and craft. Reasonable pricing and the decor is great."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting to have to order at the counter and pick up our own food when it was ready. I Can't say much for the service either, but the pizza is amazing, that's why I'm giving 3 stars. The girl at the counter had zero patience (purple and green hair) we had a few questions and it was like we were bothering her."}
{"text":"Late night pizza joint if you're out past 2:00am and can't make it to Pizza Rock this will due. I don't like pizza places that charge for ranch, 1$ extra, but it's decent pizza. I had sausage and ricotta cheese slice and it wasn't bad, still prefer Pizza Rock."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday evening , loved all the history on the walls really brought us back to when we were kids!  Had a cheese calzone it was pretty good! The service was great we were taken care of by Ryan and he cooks too that was great . I will definitely send my coworkers and friends in to check you out! Thanks for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great place,great music and great atmosphere!! We will definitely come back when we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this awesome little pizza spot during CES. This has to be the best pizza in Vegas. Cool vibes, great people, passionate chef, and friendly bar tenders. No TVs just old school arcade games and good old fashion conversation. I say a must go if near Fremont st."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The pizza is delicious, the Evel Knievel decor and atmosphere is fun, there's an Evel Knievel pinball machine to play, and the location near the corner of Fremont Street and Las Vegas Blvd is perfect!  Tip: Get the Passport parking App for easy street parking in the Downtown East area.  Pizzas are sold whole pie, as well as by the slice - and the single slices are very big! There's one Gluten free pizza option available for those who want gluten free The meatballs are delicious!  Good beer selection!  Note: order at the bar/counter, then pick up when they call your name from their bullhorn!  The only dis-merits I gave for this establishment: 1) Music was upbeat and fun.. but a bit too loud. It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with our group of friends who dined together when we visited last week. We would have preferred  the volume to be turned town a couple of notches. 2) Tables are a little too close together (Personally, I'd like just a teensy bit more space between each table)  Thus a solid 4-star rating. In fact, I'd give it a 4.5 rating if that was an option!"}
{"text":"If it's late night and you've had a few beers then this is your place, loud, busy walls, and music, staff was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"\"Too soon junior!\"  Oh my GAWWWWD!!!!!  Cool spot and great food!  I'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Pizza in town although it's a little small but absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down good solid greasy drunken pizza. Just being in this place sends me back to my junior high days at the local pizza parlor.  There's magic in the dough. Either magic or crack...I'll figure it out soon enough."}
{"text":"I wish I would've gotten names but I used to love to drop by this place every time I was downtown hitting up bars with my friends. My last experience was about 2-3 months ago and I haven't been back since.  I'm sure this happens all the time with them but I was mistaken for someone acting like they never got their pizza order but actually did. It was a very busy night for them, I saw and was patient. I had been waiting for about 10-15 mins with no pizza in hand. I ordered 2 slices. I saw customers that ordered after me get their orders, so naturally I checked in on my pizza and I was rudely told that I already was served and given my slice, when I actually did not (side note: the guy behind the counter was talking it up with a girl and i may have interrupted a good conversation ?). Someone behind the man that was \"helping\" me assured him that the slices they were doing for me burned, so they were preparing new slices. Another 10-15 mins pass and I checked in (still politely and tired from that night's festivities) and the same aggressive man yelled at me this time and said \"what are you still doing here?! You already got your slice. I'm not giving you another one\". The gentleman behind him over heard and told him, \"no her slice is almost ready\". Once I came back up for my slice, the man who has been giving me trouble gave me the \"stank face\" (he was no longer behind the counter, he was now interacting with some friends that entered the restaurant). I get it, I'm Asian, I look like every other Asian, but I promise i wasn't that girl you previously served a pizza slice to!  Anyways, leave one bad impression and leaves the customer not wanting more. Sorry for the long review, hoping it'll bring some light to the customer service aspect!"}
{"text":"We ordered the rattlesnake sausage pizza! Which came out to be $30.. I'd assume so pricey because it's on the strip. There are competitors around so that's understandable. Loved the artsy feel..it would be a good quick place to stop at if you want some decent pizza and some chill time with friends. The customer service wasn't anything special. However I would recommend to anyone.."}
{"text":"Just tried three slices and they were all fantastic...and I'm from NY! Moderately priced slices. Order at the counter and have a seat, they call your name from a bullhorn because it's a loud location. Very cool ambiance."}
{"text":"Took me a bit to write this but had such a great time. Was only going to stay for a slice but Kaylee (Kaley?) was so much fun and hilarious she kept us there for more drinks than we can remember. What an asset. Reminds me of the good places back home."}
{"text":"They're slices are made with fresh ingredients cook perfectly the bartender was sweet,,, excellent great conversation.. a definite stop for a great slice of pizza and a drink great atmosphere and really really clean bathroom kudos for that"}
{"text":"I wish the pizza here was as awesome as the ambiance. I loved the music and all the memorabilia and stickers on the walls. Unfortunately, the two slices of pizza I had were way too average for the $12 I paid for them. It wasn't gross by any means, but not as good as I was hoping for. It's one of those places where whole pizzas are sitting out on treys and then they heat up a slice for you."}
{"text":"I visited this place twice during my trip to Vegas. This Evel Knievel themed pizza joint is a block across from Freemont Street Experience. They're also open til 4am on the weekends so its a perfect place to grab a quick bite after a night out. Bonus, they have a full liquor bar :)  Each slice was around 5 bucks. The prepped pies were displayed to the right of the bar and servers will gladly describe each concoction. The pie selections vary but the ones I ordered both nights were delicious and had nice crunch from the toasted dough.  You can order at the bar, sit down tables or from the sidewalk window. Don't get intimidated by the rocker atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and bartenders make good cocktails too."}
{"text":"Awesome place! A slice of their awesome delicious slice of their \"cheesy rider\" pizza & a 16oz. Beer(PBR) for ONLY $5 is an awesome deal! like the vibe of the place that's dedicated to Evel Knievel. You can't ever go wrong with pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"Excellent work, downtown. Stopped in to check out the pizza before a comedy show down the block. The place is small so it fills up quick. We got lucky and there was a table waiting for us when we arrived.   I was joined by the bf and fellow Yelper, Kevin. Both interested in trying the rattlesnake pizza. I'm allergic to pork so I stuck to the Barry White. The guys enjoyed their pizzas although both agreed they still didn't really know how rattlesnake tastes. Personally, I assume it's for the best but I'm not that adventurous. My Barry White was delicious. My only complaint would be to offer more pork free options by the slice (although I realize I'm in a huge minority) but no one ever wants to split a full pie with me.   Tas does an awesome job behind the bar. She made sure we always had drinks and made me feel like a VIP! This is a great addition to downtown.   They also offer gf and vegan pizza but I didn't see any by the slice."}
{"text":"A new hip pizza joint on the renovated East end of Fremont Street, don't miss it!  A friendly local bartender suggested this place, and it didn't disappoint!  Great prices (lunch specials are just $5.00 and include a beer!).  It's nothing fancy, but if you're looking for some awesome NY style \"by the slice\" pizza, this is your place!  We tried both the \"Balls to the Walls\" and \"Mystery (basically Hawaiian)\" slices.  The employees had a friendly vibe, with great senses of humor.  The whole place is decked out in Evel Knievel memorabilia, and they were even offering Wild Turkey shots in honor of his birthday the night we were there!  This place has a great local and down to earth feel, so if you're tired of the buffets and fancy restaurants it's the perfect place for a quick delicious meal before heading on to Fremont street debauchery!"}
{"text":"Hot little spot in the midst of THE Fremont Street Experience.  We were starving and even with all there is to do and see in this wild town sometimes you need that late night pizza slice.  The pizza was delicious, the drinks cold and the service is excellent. It's just a bit divey and full of fun characters ... and Evel Knieval stuff but what else could you want!"}
{"text":"Love beer, pizza and punk rock. In this place beer is cold, pizza is hot and punk rock is loud. My favorite bar in DTLV. Noizy? Hot? Just use next door if you're not down for that."}
{"text":"This place is epic! Finding good gluten free pizza is hard and finding deep dish gluten free pizza has been impossible. I came here with my wife had had some draft root beer and their gluten free deep dish and were blown away! She's from Chicago and even loved it! It was so  well cooked and the cheese and sauce were perfect. This will become a Las Vegas staple for me!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, need better locks on the bathrooms since they're dual sexed, I walked in on a lady doing her business. Ordered pepperoni slice and a coke. $8ish. Lots of crust! I swear Costco pizza is better."}
{"text":"Loved their huge pizza with sausage. Enough for four persons. Beer was draft and cold too. Great atmosphere. Just ask for Kat."}
{"text":"This is a fun little joint off Fremont. Had a few different slices and some local beers. Really liked the rattlesnake pizza.  Bartender was really friendly and cute too. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"A great place to get a bite to eat after enjoying the strip. I had the Barry White (one of the best pizza's I've ever put in my mouth!) and my inebriated husband had a mystery slice, which he devoured in seconds while mumbling OMG! OMG! OMG! After trying a bite of my pizza he drunkly stumbled to the counter to order himself a slice of the Barry White. Moral of the story is drunk and sober people a like think this pizza is amazeballs!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! This place definitely helped with my pregnancy cravings haha. Pizza was amazing and the vibe was awesome! Great location! Me and my husband will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Fremont Street. I had heard about this spot, and I was like, I gotta check it out. They have a special (when I was there over the Memorial Day holiday) that is get a slice of cheese pizza and house beer for $6. I figured I would give it a shot, I mean it's fairly cheap and the worst thing that can happen is I lose $6. I was nicely surprised. The beer is a golden ale that is crisp and has a smooth flavor. The pizza-oh man the pizza was what I didn't understand. So most places that sell pizza by the slice, scoop it up and throw it in a plate and hand it to you. Not here!! They warm the slice back up so you can thoroughly enjoy it!! I mean that's what had me coming back. It is a small place and don't let that stop you from coming in and taking your slice out back if it's a nice day or to go. Please stop in and say hello to Breeze and Donna. They were super nice while providing great service."}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype about Evel Pie and was really excited to try it. I was downtown waiting for a concert to start and I remembered about the deal at Evel Pie where you get a cheese slice and PBR for $5, so I was off to grab some slices and beer. The line wasn't long inside at all, but there was a good amount of heads at tables. They have a ton of pizza options and there's a display behind a glass case showing you what they have to offer. I got a cheese slice (cheesy rider) and pepperoni slice. There's fold and eat pizza that is legit and then there's fold and eat pizza because it's so floppy you have no other choice. Sadly this pizza was the floppy kind. When I picked up the pizza slices they belly flopped. There wasn't the slightest of any structure in the crust. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste great either. For $5 I can see why people come in for this deal because it's perfectly doable if you are sober or drunk and the slices are big. I would stop by again when walking around downtown for the deal if friends wanted to, but I'd personally order from nearby Pizza Rock when downtown and craving pizza.  They have 20 inch whole pies here at Evel Pie that range in price from $24-$30 if you want more than a slice.   Cheesy Rider $4 per slice Pepperoni $4.50 per slice  Specialty $5.50 per slice"}
{"text":"The absolute best best best gluten friendly pizza I have had in five years of necessity on the GFD. I took off one star because it's far too loud to be in the restaurant. I literally got a migraine waiting for my pie. Next time I know to call in an order for pick up and then it will be the best pizza experience ever."}
{"text":"First of all Chris I know you're out there and if you read this curse you. For my bachelor party my friend took me here and said you have to do this. Long story short we had some rattlesnake pizza. I hate snakes....I really really do. If you can kid yourself though it wasn't bad at all. The meat is ground up and seasoned so it's not like there's a snake looking at you so just imagine it's sausage and you'll be just fine....maybe."}
{"text":"Delicious.... You should come here if you are downtown and want pizza. Hot, crunchy, cheesy.. Amazing. Beer is awesome too. That is all..."}
{"text":"It's pizza so it's hard not to love it. I stopped in Evil Pie while strolling along Fremont St East. They had a few option by the slice so we figured we would eat there. As the tile says Evil pie, it pays homage to the great Evil Knievel. With signage, pictures and even the old school video game and pinball machine, it is definitely themed appropriately.  The pizza was nice and thin and the reheat gave it a nice crispiness to the crust. Topping were also on point. I had the Hog Heaven, BBQ sauce, smoked mozzarella, fontina, pulled pork, \"man candy\" bacon and some red onions. It was loaded up to say the least and had some good flavors. it was kind of steep for one slice and the topping to crust ratio wasn't great. The slice had this thick end of crust when the could have stretched it out and covered the ingredients more on the pizza. Still in all not a bad tasting pie."}
{"text":"Balls to the Wall and Hog Heaven. Pizza. Slices. Yum! Will definitely be back here in a month-ish (When back in vegas). Fun place!! Check it out if you're on Fremont Street. Donna will treat u right-  and maybe sing (not)."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good and every staff member was super friendly and very accommodating! Except for Kelly... kelly was extremely rude and made derogatory comments about me when I was trying to order pizza, and referenced the way I dressed while being unprofessional as all hell. The pizza is awesome but that girl ruined the whole experience."}
{"text":"I love the gluten free pizza here SO much! I never realized deep dish gluten free pizza existed, let alone tasted as amazing as this one does! This is genuinely my favorite pizza place in Vegas. I have never had a bad reaction after eating their GF pizzas, so I would say pretty celiac friendly! Only downside is it can be extremely loud inside."}
{"text":"Great place located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas.  We came here and slammed a couple slices of AMAZING pizza.    I highly recommend this if your ever in downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is down on East Freemont and in my opinion has some of the best tasting pizza in Las Vegas. I usually reserve that for Broadway, but this place could give them a run for their money.  When you walk in the door the bar and some tables are right there for you to sit. You do have to head to the cashier to order some slices and they have a few pizzas on display for you to choose from. The girls who bartender are always really cool and helpful too.  It's one of my favorite places downtown and I hope it stays there for quite sometime!"}
{"text":"Ok the evil photo bring back alot of memories. 2 well drinks and one piece of pizza over $20  . Guess the happy hr sign is not honored. The pizza was ??? Like reheated stale. Bartender lady definitely  not a people people. We left the drinks and pizza . To look at memories 8-9 for food staff and drinks definitely no higher than 2."}
{"text":"Love this Local Spot is cool where the ambiance is all Evil Kin-evil memorabilia. The Pizza is Amazing the slices are huge and it's a perfect first date Spot $5 gets you a slice of cheese pizza and a beer!! I ask for my pizza well done as I like it crispy on the outside of crust. Bar Tenders are Cute, Great Personalities, music is always playing and it's the perfect lil Hole In the Wall!!"}
{"text":"The place is filled with awesome signs and stickers and it is very clean. The pizza is good and for the price even better. Worth going to and trying. The front windows being open and overlooking Fremont street while enjoying beer and pizza is very fun."}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you're tired of overpriced and hectic eating establishments on the strip. Divey and seedy and perfect! Best garlic knots I've ever had."}
{"text":"Loved this little pizza place. Staff was friendly and funny, the pizza was pretty good ( should be known I am a pizza snob ) so it was just good lol Anyway I will for sure be back again Great selection of beer and friendly staff will be bring me back."}
{"text":"Impressive! I've been hearing lots about this place, so I'm glad I was finally able to stop in. First of all, I love the vibe. Very loud, colorful, and rock'n'roll. Definitely MY kind of pizza joint. Secondly, the variety of options on the menu is astounding! So many different meats, cheeses, and other fun, unique toppings you could add, like RATTLESNAKE SAUSAGE. Yup, you read that right! Anyway, this place is great and pretty affordable compared to other pizza places in the area. NOTE: 20 wings for $15 is a great deal! And they aren't the wimpy little ones either."}
{"text":"This is a small, rocker-chic type place. It's dimly lit, has busy decorations (gives a real anarchy vibe), and plays rock music.   Customer service is excellent. The type of people who are in this joint seem to be more grungy and wearing all black/biker wear, and the restaurant decor and vibe itself was a little dark and foreboding (I suppose it's consistent with the name Evel Pizza). So I wouldn't recommend bringing young kids as they might get scared. But the food was DELICIOUS. Their pizza crust is so good, and I would recommend their buffalo chicken wings any day (so fresh and crispy!!!).   This is a great catch for dinner or drunchies (drunk munchies)! And I might just be back in the next couple of days!"}
{"text":"Great place with great pizza, fun people from all over the world. Great atmosphere, great place to go and have fun on Fremont. They care about local artist and first responders."}
{"text":"Six different people had six different slices and everyone loved it!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great cool pizza place, came here after having a terrible experience at another restaurant down the street. Really loved the decor inside, looked like they knew what they were doing and they did it well. Pizza was tasty, not crazy about the sauce but the toppings and bread we're fantastic. Would come again"}
{"text":"Totally impressed and in love with this place! Balls to the Wall ($5.50/slice) was my favorite because of the perfectly caramelized onions that paired well with the meatballs. 1 slice is definitely filling, but I \"accidentally\" ate 2 because I couldn't help myself!  Not only are the slices generous but all the flavors offered were also very unique. Of course there are the classic ones like pepperoni and cheese, but if you're in the area, I recommend giving their specialty pies a try!"}
{"text":"Over priced and highly over rated. Pizza was so so at best. The wait was way longer than it should have been and they forgot my order. Not sure of any redeeming value for this place. Would have been 1 star but the pizza wasn't terrible"}
{"text":"Oh man, what have I been doing all this time?! I go to downtown a lot for the bar life so I could get drunk and have fun with my friends. I usually Bar hope, so one night I just bump into this place because it's a bar as well as a Pizza restaurant. They have the perfect set up in between the whole madness of bars surrounding this place! I love it cuz now I know where to go when I need hangover food! Evel Pie's dedicated theme is a tribute to none other but the Dare Devil himself, \"Evel Knievel.\" Not only that, Evel Pie has a really rad punk rock vibe for a pizza place. Just to end this review short, a slice of pizza and a PBR is only $6! Also, they teamed up with UBER! So now you could order pizza to be delivered to you!"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here was through an external delivery service and it took over 3 hours for the food to arrive. By the time that it came not only was it cold and soggy, we had already gone to bed and my concierge desk had to call me several times to wake up to approve the driver to drop off the food. Since I assumed this issue was in part the fault of the driver or the app, we decided to give this place a second chance one night when we were downtown. The vibe of this place is definitely unique with all the stickers and Evel Knievel related items hanging from he ceiling. When we walked in it was pouring rain outside, the door was wide open and the place was freezing cold. Since it seems like a walk in establishment we went to sit down at the bar and were told we had to order at the cashier. So we stood up and walked over. I am gluten free and knew there was one thing on the menu I could have - the Gluten Free pizza. The gluten free pizza comes as a deep dish and with three included toppings for $21. Since I am aware of how SMALL this $21 pizza is (about 6 inches wide and four inches deep) I decided to ask for heartier toppings to switch out for. However, they don't allow it not even for an extra charge per topping. What a disappointment. So, I accepted the pizza as is and went to cash out. Upon receipt of my change, I was given less than what was owed. When I asked for the receipt the cashier said \"oh I didn't give you all your change\" granted it was literally change and not dollars, but none-the less taking a tip without asking is not good business practice in my book and that was clearly what he did since he gave only dollars and no cents. The pizza took well over 30 minutes and came out overcooked and extremely crispy on the outside and dry on the inside. The three \"toppings\" were not generous and the flavor was absolutely missing. Honestly, the deep dish is more air than anything. I will not be coming back due to the price point, flavor and poor customer service.  Note the attached receipt - I gave $40 cash and it states I paid exact change."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Small but great pizza and service. Stopped in expecting not much for the pizza and was pleasantly surprised. Our bartender Kay, was hilarious and awesome! I will def stop there again next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Shame they advertise $1 pizza but apparently that's just a bribe to get you here to their shows. Asked the inside and they said out back. Ask the bartender and she rudely says no such thing. Thats odd because Im looking at their business flyer advertising that right now. Well I appreciate the run around hut ill pass next time Im looking for something to do downtown."}
{"text":"I've had some terrible pizza AND terrible beer before but not this bad at the same time. Skip the $6 slice & a beer. Burned cheese pizza and somebody's Homebrew gone bad."}
{"text":"Love this place. Simple as that. Don't expect to find parking though, it's impossible. This is the place you end your night after hitting up those bars Downtown. I always get a slice of Barry White and a side of those Garlic Deez Nuts. Once you order you'll hear your name called on the megaphone from a heavily tattooed pizza pro. They also have seating in the back, which is always a nice option when you just want some peace and quiet."}
{"text":"Great crust. Fun music. Better decor. Really so good. Can't wait for the back patio to open. Well worth the drive downtown"}
{"text":"Never did I ever think a pizza joint would beat out Pizza Rock for my favorite slice in the city.  I've been dying to check this place out for a very long time. Unfortunately I don't make it downtown anymore as much as I would like to. My sister-in-law is in town and we were in DTLV for the second night in a row.  We were headed to first Friday and wanted to make sure we had something somewhat solid in our bellies before stuffing it full of junk food. We swung through Evel Pie and picked up a slice each. I was ecstatic to see such incredible pies on display. Such fluffy crust, chewy and delightful, this place does it right. Reminds me of my East Coast home. I grabbed a pepperoni slice, which after warmed up was extremely greasy but I sucked it up with a napkin. The husband got a cheese and my sister-in-law picked up a Greek slice of pie. Holy moly, we were delighted.   The staff was super nice, real people, and I loved the atmosphere. We will absolutely make Evel Pie a regular stop in our routine. It's super helpful that it's right next to where my husband works.  We got three slices and three bottled waters for $25. The cheese slice was four dollars, pepperoni was $4.50, and the Greek slice was $5.50. Pretty reasonable for such a bad ass pie.  This so-called Evel Pie was absolutely heavenly."}
{"text":"Well, I will start by saying it was close to 2am and I may have been slightly intoxicated.. but this pizza was fantastic. Many different kinds of pizza to choose from, prices were reasonable, and service was great. They also have many kinds of beer to choose from as well."}
{"text":"Not a bad slice.  Good cheese. Nice atmosphere.  Maybe 2nd to pizza rock just a few blocks away"}
{"text":"This place is my spirit animal. Evel Pie is one of my favorite pizza joints in town. The pies are huge, fairly priced, aaaaaaand there's pin ball. I mean cmon, how can it get better than that? Located by some of my favorite restaurants downtown, Evel Pie doesn't lack in flavor or excitement!"}
{"text":"We stayed on Fremont St so this place was close. Stumbled in there around 10 one night and ordered a slice of pie and let me tell you it was fresh, hot, flavorful and just flat out awesome!  The bartender was engaging and friendly (pink hair). We had seen there sign shortly after the shooting that mentioned that they were feeding First Responders for free. How stand up is that!! Our next trip to Vegas we returned for lunch and everything was just as good. We had a salad with our pizza and everything was amazing again. Needless to say this is on our Favorites list! See you soon!"}
{"text":"My cousins are in town from New York ,so finding a good pizza place can be difficult . I found this place while walking downtown and it definitely meets the Yelp 5 star raves . Both slices I had were full of flavor and the crust was cooked to perfection . My cousins said wow , taste like New York pizza . Not too mention the Vegas Raiders were all in the bar when we walked in . Perfect pizza meets an amazing hockey team !"}
{"text":"Husband and I split 4 different speciality pizza slices, saving the rattlesnake for last. All delicious minus the last.  We asked the cook if it was indeed the rattlesnake slice because we never had it before, and couldn't tell where the sausage was.  All he said was yes...our thoughts was maybe the sausage was under the cheese or hidden under the peppers?  The guy next to us order it as well, but when it was served, the cook realized there wasn't any sausage placed on the pizza. Turns out we ate pizza with no rattlesnake.  Wish we could've had it the right way...and no we didn't ask for another slice and it was too busy to explain the mishap. I feel it could've been a better experience if it was right the first time.  One question: how the hell does the cook not know that the pizza is incompletely made?"}
{"text":"Wonderful little hole in the wall place with friendly staff and the best pizza this side of NYC, On top of that the nostalgia is great. Walls full of evil knievel pictures with many celebrities and some pix doing his famous motorcycle jumps. Gotta luv it."}
{"text":"I love this place. A slice of cheese pizza and a PBR for $6 is a great deal. Every slice I've tried, I've loved and the garlic knots are great too. Plus Evel Knievel pinball!"}
{"text":"Newest pizza place on Fremont street. First of all... they have a deal to get a slice of pizza AND beer for $5... enough said. It's Evel Knievel themed, giving the atmosphere a cool vibe. Their slices are huge and SO good. Its a slice that's thinner but packed with flavor. They have a huge selection. The vibe of this place is definitely cool to kick back, relax, eat, and go back to bar hopping. It's located right in the middle of the Fremont east bars making it very convenient to get to. I would suggest parking at the neonopolis garage or trying your luck at the free side street parking down the street. My service has always been friendly and fast. I love it and can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat here for lunch/dinner and continue to be amazed with the rocking decor and wonderful staff. The line was a little long this time but so worth their pizza and beer. The prices are still amazing too. Decided to order the pizza by by the slice since a big one would be too much pizza for me. While the memories come back from my early Yelping days I sit here and enjoy pizza and beer. With such great scenery, rockin tunes, and cold beer how could one wrong."}
{"text":"The amusingly named Balls to the Wall pizza was very good.  Maybe not the best pizza I have ever had but I would definitely come again when I am in the area.  Pizza by the slice is the way to go here.  Comes out fast!  It is a bit too loud for easy conversation but the mix of classic punk, hip-hop and rock makes for a fun atmosphere.  The pinball machine seems to be broken."}
{"text":"When it's 1am and you're wrapping up your downtown Las Vegas bar crawl, your tolerance for dropping $5.50 on a slice of pizza just might grow exponentially.  Such was the case when my friend and I found ourselves at Evel Pie after he surrendered to his pizza craving. It looked crowded earlier, but we seemed to hit a temporary dip in the crowd and didn't have to wait too long in line to order. Our slices came out pretty quickly afterward, presumably after they'd been run through the oven quickly to restore them to a high temperature point.  Although my friend was content to go with the $6 deal (cheese slice + house beer, which is the light and bland Evel Ale), I did grab some specialty slices for $5.50. I recalled seeing the Snake River pizza on TV when Evel Pie was featured on an episode of Food Paradise, so I went for it. Frankly, the rattlesnake sausage tasted much like regular pork sausage. The slice was otherwise quite sparsely adorned, so I'm disappointed that I surrendered to that impulse.  I much preferred my second slice, the Balls to the Wall. Massive dollops of ricotta and reasonable amounts of meatball made every bite a treat. I didn't even have to add parmesan or red pepper flakes to this one. The thin crust was otherwise similar to the other piece, substantial and chewy and neither soggy or crunchy.  I don't think I'll flock downtown for Evel Pie, but they're a fine choice for a late night snack if you're walking around Fremont Street."}
{"text":"$5.00 for pizza and a beer. That's hard to beat. Friendly staff. Right off Fremont downtown Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Super delisio in my tastebud cavities and ramrodded happiness into my tum tum. I vote yum yum for dis fatty joint."}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover. It's one of my favorite foods and thus I'm a harsh judger of pizza! And also of ranch. Having incredible ranch dressing at a pizza place is a must! I honestly wasn't a fan of the pizza at Evel Pie, it just wasn't my kind of pizza. It has a very cool vibe and environment though in the pizza place."}
{"text":"LIVE HARD, RIDE FAST, EAT PIZZA  That pretty much says it all for this super rad downtown evel knievel themed pizza house.  First of all when you see the decor you will be in awe. This place is too cool with all of the art, stickers, and most Awesome Evel Knievel items, bike, pinball, etc. What an Awesome set up, you will be mind blown with all of the detail that went into setting this fun joint up.   I think I should get to the food, not only does the decor get your visual senses going. The food is ridiculous good! We ordered a pizza called \"Balls to the Wall\" it was tasty. They have legit good pizza. We split a meatball grinder which was also delicious.  This pizza house is a Winner.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I've been here or maybe once or twice before every time the cooks ALWAYS mess up the orderand the pizza taste like literally cardboard. tonight was even more unusual because they had a large black security man trying to be as racist as he could be towards me a white woman just because he thought that he could get away with it by calling me white bitch telling me to get in line as if he was some sort A ruler of this place I cannot believe that I had to go into an establishment and be called a bitch from a racist human being and then just trying to hang out with my family . I go into the back and he's standing with two white women in the alley trying to spit his game at them apparently and I'm standing right next to them and he tells me that I have to move and that they are fine right where they are I'm sorry because you thought that they were going to suck His dick.  Absolutely a palling  fuck this place and everyone that runs it because they're all fucking immature shits who don't know how to bake a god damn pizza or get out of their hormones to run an establishment"}
{"text":"So I made the trip to DTLV so i could get a slice of there pie. I opted for the  Barry White. If your not a fan of his music you will be a fan of the pizza assuming you like ricotta cheese. I like to taste the ricotta in every bite so I spread the dollops across the entire piece. They have a special where it's a slice of cheese pizza and a  pint of there house brew for $6 bucks."}
{"text":"My partner and I really love Pizza  so much so that we even have Pizza tattoos. So we were excited, naturally, to try Evel Pie after a dance night on Fremont Street. We went in to get our pizza and were relatively pleased with the Pizza. My partner loved the Barry White slice; but the pepperoni left much to be desired. If we were just remarking on the Pizza, we would give an average 4 star rating.   However, we were mortified by the outright classist, anti-homeless, and possibly racist behavior they exhibited. My partner noticed that a young woman was sitting at a table with only juice to drink and no food. She decided to offer to buy the woman a slice. We suspected that she was homeless, and felt that she might want something to eat. As she approached the counter to place the order, one of the employees warned my partner that \"just so you know, she's in here all the time asking people to buy her pizza.\" He said this as If to encourage my partner to rethink her gesture. My partner was a little annoyed, but graciously thanked and dismissed his concern. However, soon after we noticed the security at her table asking her to leave. We were very disappointed to see that they actually packed up her food and forced her to leave, even though it was completely paid for, including the tip. She didn't appear to be bothering anyone and there was plenty of open seating. We were dismayed and disgusted... we couldn't even enjoy our meal and the pizza is forever marred in our minds. It felt even yuckier that the staff was all white and the woman was black."}
{"text":"What a great spot!  Good brew and great pies.  They stay busy but the service is pretty alright even when they are slammed.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza was decent. We had our dogs so we ate outside, the mural covering the front of the building was awesome."}
{"text":"Not a bad a bad slice of pizza but the operations of this place are a joke.  Waitress took my order for a 5.50 slice of pizza -- paid 10 dollars and never gave me change.  When I asked for my change she unapologetically said I didn't see you still there.  Waited 20 minutes as the overwhelmed staff placed random slices of pizza on the counter.  When asked why they weren't calling any ones names, their only response was we would if we had any idea who ordered what."}
{"text":"Wow I had the Calzone.  It was enough for family of four or three adults.  Pizza was fantastic too.  Don't let the decor fool you.  Freaking great food"}
{"text":"Brought a group of people, my Girl Scout troop, LOL, in and loved it.  The staff was very friendly.  There are plenty of tables or you can sit at the bar.  You order at the counter that has a great display of slices to go.  We ordered the cheese and pepperoni pies.  The pizza was yummy and served to our table.  The decor is a mix of old Las Vegas and Evel Knievel, heavy on the Evel Knievel.  Whats not to love?!  The bathrooms are clean.  This is our new go to pizza place when being a local/tourist."}
{"text":"Who doesn't LOVE good pizza and Evil K? Another must go to place when you visit vegas. A throwback of the 70's n 80's combined w a creative pizza menu to match. Me and my gf ate and played games for 2hrs. I lost myself in this spot, super cool and the food was on point!"}
{"text":"Nice and convenient Location,GREAT service! The pizza is not horrible but also nothing special about it. I was expecting a way better tasting pizza for almost $6 a slice."}
{"text":"Wow what a great find! Opened my trusty Yelp app and typed in pizza, sort by rating and BAM I'm heading over to the best slices in Vegas!   Let me start by saying I am a pizza fanatic! Grew up in New Jersey and had pizza up and down the boardwalks from Wildwood, Atlantic City and Asbury Park as well as at the Big Apple of course.  I know what I like and am always looking for the best pizza when I travel.  When on vacation I usually have pizza every day and I'm always looking for something a little different.  ENTER: EVIL PIZZA'S AMAZING HOG HEAVEN SLICE!!!    For $5.50 you get an amazing crust loaded up with BBQ sauce, smoked mozzarella, fontina, pulled pork, candied bacon, red onion and some parsley to green it up a touch!  This is a serious slice and the mixture of sweet sauce and pork along with the slightly salty cheese blend is a match made in heaven!  'Now don't judge a book by it's cover' should be their slogan.  Doesn't exactly look like the fanciest restaurant in Vegas but sometimes the best food comes from joints like this.  It's actually a pretty cool motif and yes, it's evil because once you eat here you won't accept anything less!  Hooked for life!"}
{"text":"Great place with a great deal. Slice of cheese pizza with a PBR for only $5. The pizza is cheesy and the beer is cold.   The place is an Evel Knievel tribute bar located in Fremont East, half a block away from the Fremont  Experience. It small, with bright signs, like everything in Vegas. We visited on a Wednesday afternoon. Not busy at all, but not empty either. The staff is nice and the pizzas look yummy. Can't wait to try another type!   Definitely a place to stop by! They open late!"}
{"text":"My girl and I were recently visiting from Long Beach CA...we drunkenly stumbled upon this gem! We ate, drank, and listened to dope music while we continued to drink! We left there full, drunk, and happy! Cheap pizza and beer is a dream come true! We will definitely be back! Also, Kelly..the bartender is my new homie...a fellow Long Beach chick.....great service and vibe :)"}
{"text":"WOW!! Best pizza I've had in a very long time. Its a little expensive but so worth it."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Grab a slice and they're open late. When it's 1 am and you're starving this is the place to go. Beers are good and the slices are great. The meatball slice was my favorite with the caramelized onions.  Highly recommend.  I beat the crowd there so I was able to grab a seat at the bar"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the coolest pizza/bars I've been to vibes awesome ,music even better ! Definitely will be coming back here again and again ! Btw the pizza was great had the \" Goblin sausage \" I'm a pork lover so couldn't pass it up .. place is filled with dope stickers and random and classic pictures of some of rock and rolls greats !"}
{"text":"A gem of a place off of Fremont. Great pizza (this from a Chicagoan). Really enjoy the atmosphere. Grab a beer and a slice. Then head back where they have awesome performers.   An amazing punk / rock show tonight. Sounds fantastic and a perfect way to set the mood for the night.   There is parking next door but it can be a bit pricier than other places. If you don't mind walking you can pretty much park for next to nothing a couple of blocks away.   Back to the pizza: many slice selections and they heat it up right. Crisp and hot. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza here! I know I prob was a little intoxicated when I had it, but they have lots of variety and the slices are a good size. We went on St Patrick's day down to Freemont and even with the crazy crowds, it only took us maybe 10 minutes to be sitting down and eating our pizza pie :) We will definitely be visiting again next time we are downtown."}
{"text":"Never fails best pizza joint in law Vegas hands down! $6 slice and drink combo!!!! You won't be disappointed with the quantity and QUALITY"}
{"text":"Want a great slice of pie with a PRB and a side of 70's nostalgia for $5??  Evel Pie is serving it up everyday along with other specials!  Conveniently located at the Fremont Experience East, this place puts out a cool vibe to grab some unique pizza.    I ordered the $5 special, a slice of cheese and a pint of PBR... a great deal!  Pizza was excellent, thin NY style crust and cheesy!  A must stop for any pizza and Evel Knievel fan!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Vegas and I had to try some pizza on my last day before I flew back. I got take out and the price was a bit high but wow was it worth the price.  The pizza is so amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great Slices and Great Crew Working tonight. Thank you Justin and the Crew!!!   You guys Rock the Pizza"}
{"text":"Yum and wow! Good pizza and the decor was really cool! I'm here visiting my sister who lives in Nevada and we ate  here. Had a white pizza and it was serious yum. My parents who were with us had some meat pizza that looked good too. The place is located right outside of the Freemont experience  area. Really cool location to hang out in, not prissy and uppty. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place!  As a kid in the '70's Evel Knievel was my hero.  Fast forward to the present and combine Evel Knievel, a dive bar and pizza all into one....pure gold!    So even though this is a theme bar, it's not just hokey kitsch like far too many places in Vegas.   This place has some seriously good pizza.  Thin crust, NY style, cooked with a hint of char on the crust as it should be.  We got a pizza and pitcher combo deal that was reasonably priced and loved everything about it.  No pretentiousness,  just a comfortable,  chill environment  with some pizza and beer.  All good!"}
{"text":"Am glutenfree celiac I have come here before for the probably the only deep dish glutenfree pizza in town so I was willing to spend the $30 for it but this time the dough tested extremely old and stale very disappointed   Local here"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times when we were in town for Punk Rock Bowling.  My kinda joint.  Good pie.  Excellent beer selection.  Good music.  I'd have left 5 stars, but my partner's slice was a little overdone on the second visit.  Regardless, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow the pizza is delicious. And it is hot! The beer is cold, but not as cold as the bartender melissa. She was in an awful mood tonight. What's wrong Melissa?"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a New York slice place I used to go to during high school lunches. Outstanding slices! Authentic to the detail. We keep going back and take more people with us to experience this new gem."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza joint by far. No need for formality, just super solid crew running a fun hip pizza shop.   Expect them to be busy almost alll the time but the pizzas are worth it."}
{"text":"Even though I had one too many drinks prior to eating here, I enjoyed every bit of that pizza! Man, probably some of the best slices I've ever had, no joke. Perfectly cooked and the cheese to sauce ratio was great. Can you guys come to San Diego?!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the area. One of the best late night spots as well which is very important for this overnight person! Delivery is as perfect as eat in. Amazing pizza, amazing creations, fantastic gluten free and customizations. Anything you want they will do. Love these guys."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Gotta love a place where you can hang out, eat great food, drink beer and hear old school music playing.  The service was excellent as well.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came with some friends and ordered a side house salad and a slice of their  Barry White pizza. Great fresh food, and super cool vibe. Who doesn't want to eat good food and chill with friends while listening to the Beastie Boys?!  Mos def will be a place to revisit."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is small and if you judge a book by its cover big mistake! This pizza is bomb!!!! Came here a few times over the course of few days! I'll definitely be back and only wish there was one in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This is a very enjoyable bar.  Through all of the hustle of Fremont street you can go into Evil Pie to a relaxing environment.  The decor, the service, and the food are all fantastic."}
{"text":"I just had a custom Gluten-free made by cool ass Vincent himself. It was the best pizza I ever had! The atmosphere reminded me of Seattle and I loved the music and drink selection. All around winner, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"New York-style slices? Check! Crazy flavor combinations? Check! Rattlesnake-pheasant sausage? Only place I've ever seen that! Might try net time.  I love fully saturated theme establishments...this one is no exception with memorabilia from Evel Knievel's insane life all over the walls and behind the counter. This is not a fancy place...it's very NYC-street-feeling and I would expect to find it in any neighborhood."}
{"text":"A very substantial addition to the already burgeoning food offers on this block of Fremont. Specializing in pizza (could you tell?), this place channels its inner Butte, Montana to provide the visitor with what feels like a pizza joint that has been here for decades (but in reality only moved in last month).  They do pies and slices. A few specialty slices are interesting: I like the rattlesnake which utilizes real snake and pheasant for the meatballs. What's more metal than snake meat on your pizza?!  What's pizza without beer? They have bottles, draft, and cans to choose from. Good selection of all. If you'd like something a little more heavy, they do have a full bar available, as well as wine.  Great service when I visited. They're doing a good job of working the tourist crowd while keeping things inviting for the locals, too."}
{"text":"I visit East Fremont frequently, and I noticed that a new eatery opened up in a previously occupied space. Frankly, what got my attention was a sandwich board offering a slice of cheese pizza and pint of PBR for $5.00. (Not a bad deal:  per the menu board, a slice of cheese pizza is listed as $4.00, and a pint of domestic beer as $4.00.)  Evel Pie looks like a combination of an old fashion NYC pizza joint (+) a neighborhood dive bar. The inside is comfortably worn, but clean. It's decorated with eclectic kitsch--most paying tribute to Evel Knievel. There are small table games at the bar, and on the tables. The bar has a good selection of beers on tap, and in bottles and can. They also serve cocktails.  But I'd like to focus on the pizza. (You can buy slices or whole pies.) What I liked best about the pizza was the crust. It was a really good NY style slice: the crust was not too thick, not to thin; it was nice and crisp, but not dry; and when you folded it, it had a really nice \"crunch\". The topping was of good taste and quality, and sufficient quantity.  It wasn't too crowded while I was there. (Maybe because it was midday, mid-week; maybe because this place had been open for less than a week.) But I can see this place as being a great place to hang out with friends for some \"day drinking\".  Bottom line:  If you are a local, it's a nice place to hang out. If you are visitor, it's a nice place to get some good food and drink at \"non-tourist\" prices."}
{"text":"We had walked to what we thought was the end and notice the name Evil Pie. After checking rating, decided to try. This is on the far East side of Fremont, not really the main section. Pizza was great! Young crowd with really loud music. We had 2 slices with the most friendly watress. You order at the register, then listen for your name. So glad we gave it a try"}
{"text":"I have to confess, I did not eat here but....our Lyft driver dropped us off in front and said if you are going to eat pizza this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"Great pizza, happy welcoming service, draft beet and a ton of Evel Knievel memorabilia."}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free I've ever had! It is super fluffy and doesn't taste like cardboard! For all my wheat sensitivity people out there like myself! Finally pizza I can eat in a old skool rocker atmosphere! Already a big fan of the place!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. The pizza is delicious, and we'll get back to that in a minute, but the restaurant itself is awesome and needs to be discussed. The walls are lined with not only some incredible Evel Knievel photos, but also photos of Vegas legends like Wayne Newton and Siegfried & Roy. There are Evel Knievel toys sitting high above on shelves and a bike hanging from the ceiling. There are also 2 functioning games, a stunt rider arcade video game and a pinball machine.  Now back to the pizza. They serve up pretty large slices, and the best things to order are the ones that sound like odd combinations or toppings. We split a slice of the snake river pizza, which is topped with sausage made out of rattlesnake. I also enjoyed a Maui Waui slice which is a classic Hawaiian pizza, but with added jalapeño slices (which is how I'll be ordering my Hawaiian pizzas from now on). The pizzas are made with a cracker thin crust and are heated again in the oven before being served to you, so don't be worried about lukewarm pizza, because it will come out of the pick-up window screaming hot.   This is a fun spot that I'm looking forward to taking friends and family from out of town to when we take them down to Fremont street, as it's not even a block away. I enjoyed coming here and I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"The pizza was disappointing. Probably the blandest white pizza I've ever had. The Caesar salad was hastily made and perfectly mediocre. It came to our table with three forks and no plates and was basically thrown at us by our \"server\" who was on her way out the door. I know this because she had her backpack on.  My wife and I ate out of the bowl while we wondered who the extra fork was for. When I ordered a beer for my wife, they came back with a pitcher and then gave me attitude about it when I pointed out their mistake. They never fixed it and I ended up paying for that pitcher of beer. When I called the manager, he told me to call my bank and he couldn't have cared less about it. This place is a joke and a pretentious tourist trap."}
{"text":"Ate here with my husband and 11 yr old daughter @ about 6pm on a Friday night, plenty of open tables, seat yourself. My husband and I ordered the $5 special, slice of cheese pizza and PBR draft. Most other slices are around $5. My daughter ordered a slice of pepperoni, which was too spicy for her, but I thought it was good! We also ordered the garlic knots, yum! Pinball was only 25 cents for 5 balls, and you can have you have up to 4 players, lots of fun."}
{"text":"Evel Knievel was a legend, so a place with his theme needs to live up to his name. I'm happy to say that this place does!   Good beer selection Tasty big slices Fantastic decor  This will be a hangout spot at least once or twice a week for me. So glad this place exists.  Oh also, $5 gets you a beer and a slice. Can't go wrong with that when you're hungry downtown."}
{"text":"Punk rock pizza place. Looks super rad. It's cool that they have vegan options, but there isn't much by-the-slice that's free of animal products (just veggie and sauce only slice).  Also, you can't get the happy hour special on the veggie pizza, nor the $6 for a slice and a PBR, that one should at least be good for the veggie w no cheese option. So yeah, this place is almost perfect but $10 for a veggie slice w no cheese and a PBR is a little steep.  The pizza sauce is dope."}
{"text":"This Evel Knievel themed pizza place is an interesting place to stop on Fremont east. They have tasty New York style thin crust pizza, and other Italian cuisine. The smell of the pizza cooking draws you in off of the street! The pizza is good- not quite \"East coast\" good, but I would eat here again. They have a full bar also. There's a variety of Evel Knievel memorabilia hanging on the walls to glance at while waiting. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The prices were right for a quick stop off for a slice and a drink."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to eat during the Mint 400 celebration.  If you love biker/rocker bar atmosphere, this is the place for you.  The walls are covered in Evel Knievel and celebrity memorabilia.  They have the best rock and metal blasting through their speakers.  And while they have a good selection of beer on tap, by far the best is the Root Beer!  Probably the best root beer I've had anywhere.  The pizza was good, but I've had better.  To be fair, I am quite picky with my pizza, and nothing beat real Long Island, NY pizza!  Evel Pie has a nice a thin crust and decent flavor sauce that thankfully they use sparingly.  Their garlic knots/roll things had NO GARLIC whatsoever and were VERY dry.  Their \"Grandma's Balls\" are pretty good.    So overall, an OK place to get pizza.  There are better places in Vegas for pizza.  But non offer the delicious root beer on tap and the fun environment that Evel Pie offers."}
{"text":"Ok so I should have written this review a few days ago but here it is . I love pizza , who doesn't right ... well I'm super picky about my crust and theirs is amazing light and crisp .... but I've had to go gluten free and have missed pizza so much and gluten free pizza isn't a good as regular, or so I thought .... we ordered a gluten free pizza it's kinda like a deep dish but better ( I'm not a fan off deep dish) and it tasted like regular flour crust , it was light and airy , they add cheese around the outside of the crust and is it AMAZING!!!! I ate it with two guys that were skeptical and honestly don't like gluten free crap but even they were raving about it ! I posted a picture see for yourself !  Great pizza ! Great bartender ! Great atmosphere! Great prices!  Thanks Evil Pie for thinking about us glutards"}
{"text":"Damn good pizza. Had 1/2 cheese and 1/3 snake river.  Delish.  Crust stood up better to cheese. Good quality ingedients lived the sausage.  Yum."}
{"text":"Came here to eat because we saw good reviews but definitely didn't meet our expectations... we ordered by the slice since my husband and I couldn't eat a whole pizza by ourselves & the slices were hard because they had been sitting there for a while, so hard that my jaw hurts after eating a slice. Not enough sauce on the pizza and price per slice was $4.50 which is ridiculous because the pizza wasn't  that great..."}
{"text":"Cool spot in dt Vegas , open late , slices , and beer , cool environment. Came in late after drinking, ordered a buncha slices of whatever they had, all were good , would come by again"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place cause they won an award for gluten free pizza. What I didn't realize was they have 1 gluten free pizza, the Olivia gluten free John.   So don't expect to get anything else. They are not very customer friendly, my wife asked for extra cheese and was told, nope, be too heavy on the pizza, asked for grenadine added to her coke, told nope, don't have it. Have a full bar but no grenadine?   Order at a Counter, no waitress service, for lunch at least and they bring you the pizza. Right after we got ours a homeless guy walked up to our table and asked if he could have some. He was quickly escorted out of the place.  Now for the food, both pizzas were really good. They 20\" is all of that, a huge pie with a thin crust very reminiscent of what I've had in a pizza shop in Brooklyn. Plenty of pepperoni was scattered across the top. The Olivia gluten free John was ordered with sausage and onion and was also pretty big, and being deep crust I managed to eat 4 out of 6 pieces. (We took the rest home, looked for the homeless guy to give him some but he was not around).   The music was so loud was nearly impossible to have a conversation. I guess I'm too old but I didn't enjoy the visit at all. Between the ear splitting music and homeless people accosting me, I was disappointed as I was really looking forward to trying this place. It was also expensive, a little north of 70 bucks for 2 pizzas and 3 cokes. I'd prefer waitress service for that kind of money. Pizza was good but everything else drags the review down"}
{"text":"Evel Pie has the most amazing pizza I have ever tasted! The crust and sauce are perfectly balanced and coming from a family of Italians owning Italian restaurants I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur for sure! My favorite pizza is Balls To The Wall and definitely make sure to order a side of their meatballs!!!!  Brandy Provenzano"}
{"text":"Pizza was hard as a rock. This place is dirty even by Fremont street standards. Pizza taste like sparrow food court pizza. Never eating here again. Go to Pizza Rock instead, it is way better!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good thin crispy and hot!!!! Just like I like it !!!!! I would definitely say it's worth a stop"}
{"text":"I come here almost every time I visit Fremont street! I love the dive bar vibe and the surprisingly delicious pizza. The security guard at the front door was extremely nice to me and my family when we visited a this past Saturday."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite slice in Vegas and a great spot to hang out. Nothing like it anywhere else, and that's a GREAT thing. Try the Hog Heaven!"}
{"text":"The best pie hands down. The dive bar vibe is awesome. The pizza is amazing. No bs try it will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We heard about this place & decided to try it, pretty cool collection dedicated to Evel Knievel. Interesting bar, quite the variety of beers, stiff shots, cool music, a slice of pizza, & there ya go! Interesting vintage memorabilia a groovy trip back to the 70's for sure, the vintage beer selection is a throwback at its best with Hamms & Schlitz on the menu! Hubby & I cracked up at that one, you will get a kick outta this place for sure! Pretty cool to stop in for a drink a slice, and some nostalgia when your on Fremont St.  I Would Like To Add A Special Thank You To Branden & Kirsten For Doing Such A Great Job With All The Music There It Is Quite A Eklectic Mix Of 70's Genre & It Takes You Back!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and very friendly service. Have to check out the Hog Haven pizza. Right down from Freemont, so conveniently located if u staying down on Freemont, but not hard to get to from main strip. I recommend coming here for the pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and I can bring my kids inside!  Not much to it, but it is great memorial to the legendary Evel Knieval.  The pizzas are huge with great flavors and the specialty combo like Balls to the Wall was amazing...by the way, what a great name for a pizza!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing but the $ should be $$$ because this place will easily take you for $50-$60 / 2 people. That's 2 drinks, 2 slices and grandma's balls set me back $45. Definitely worth it but not all the time simply because of cost.  Thanks @Branden love your grandma's balls and can't wait to come back! Will try your pizza and beer deal too!"}
{"text":"I have never ate in this place, however I pick up food from here quite often for Uber and I want to give a shout out to all the night time staff. every time I come inside of there location, the staff is extremely humble and welcoming.  Pretty cool people. Definitely will come in and try it out on my own someday"}
{"text":"6 $ cheese pizza and their own house beer... pretty good. Not my best pizza but great value for the price.  It's good to just get away from the craziness and have a bite."}
{"text":"Mike and Jordan were a dream team! The pizza is amazing I highly recommend you try it! They took their time to go over the options and explain everything to me! I will be back with my friends! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been here til today but this place has been our base for mostly everything that has been distributed for the Las Vegas shooting. They're amazing & the teamwork is amazing. I'll be coming back just cuz the staff is awesome & been so involved in the community. & the pizza is bomb. Ok I'm done. Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I ever had!!! This is my new favorite pizza spot for their amazingly delicious pizza and the location's vibe/ambiance."}
{"text":"This is a really cool pizza beer spot with old vintage pinball and $5 will get you a slice of cheese pizza and a PBR. Can't beat that right! We came in tonight for dinner and beers but unfortunately they were out of their gluten-free pizza so we had to leave.    Last time we were here I told them specifically about my gluten free sensitivity and they highly recommended their gluten free pizza but you had to order the whole pie.  Looking forward to their pizza, our group chose this place tonight based on my diet and what a slap in my face, they were out of gluten-free dough. It wouldn't be ready till the next day. HUGE downfall. Poor example on them. I know they have better potential!! We left and came to El Cortez to eat"}
{"text":"Cheap and good! For happy hour you can get a cheese slice and beer for $5. It's kinda small but the atmosphere is fantastic! Definitely a place to meet up with your friends for a quick bite before you hit the town or if you need to sober up! The pizza was pretty good, not amazeballs but almost there!"}
{"text":"Stopped by at lunch for a few slices while in town on business. I ordered a slice with meat and a slice with meat and ricotta. They have clever names for all their pies and I don't remember the names of what I ordered.   The pies are New York style with a thin crust that has a nice crispy outside and soft inside.   I loved my slices so much I grabbed a slice of cheese as well.   The decor on this place is awesome. Filled with customer placed stickers and Evil Kenevil memorabilia. Tons to look at while you're enjoying the amazing pizza."}
{"text":"Iv been in vegas for 3 months and out of all the places iv visited this is one of my favourites. We stopped in for a $20 jug of beer and pizza special. The pizza was simple and not overly greasy which iv found most other pizza places are. From the cool graffiti in the bathroom to the evel knievel inspired decore, old school tunes and the great meal special, i highly recommend evel pie."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE FREMONT DRUNK FOOD SPOT!   They close at 4:20 am (hehe) so they will be there for you when all you can think about after bar hopping is pizza. They are an evel canieval themed bar/pizza shop. They have delicious pizza, wings, garlic knots etc. definitely try their vegan pizza too if you like that kinda stuff.   They also have rad decor and an outdoor patio in the back where bands play and stuff. Totally a rad spot with some awesome badass staff. (Looking at you kat!)   Evel pie is an awesome addition to the downtown community"}
{"text":"My girl friends and I had been planning to come here our next trip to vegas and we were not disappointed. They stay open really late which is great when you're in a place like las vegas that never sleeps. Right away at the front door we were greeted by the nicest and most polite security/host craig! Craig alone made our experience such an enjoyable one, he interacted with everyone throughout their whole visit and really made sure to keep everyone happy. When we first got there we waited in a bit of a line to order but it went super quick. The quantity of people kind of come in waves there it seems. At first it was really busy and there was no places to sit inside but plenty of nice seating outside.. super nice seating! Luckily we got to sit inside before our food came though which didn't take long but was also so hot and fresh when it came out. In total we got a slice of pepperoni pizza, a slice of hogs heaven pizza, and garlic knots. Everything we got had a unique flavor to it and my taste buds were very pleased! I'd totally come here again and again. I recommend this spot to everyone. Also every place needs a Craig!!"}
{"text":"Wow how cool Is this place! Totally fun vibe and as a former New Yorker I'm pretty picky about my pizza and theirs is a spot-on New York slice. Really enjoyed it, very festive atmosphere on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Great bar and pies, reminds me of a place down in Greenwich Village from my youth.  I bring my brother here every time he's in town from NY.  PBR pitchers are the way to go"}
{"text":"We were driving from Zion to Vegas and staying at the JW Marriott. We arrived late and didn't get settled in until around 11pm. We were tired and didnt want to bother with the Strip. We've been craving pizza and found Evel Pie on Yelp, and we decided to give them a try since it was still open and had good reviews. This place did not disappoint. Our pizza was incredibly delicious!! We ordered Evel Knievels Super Kick Ass Combination pizza which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, ham,mushrooms, red onions, and roasted peppers. I'm back home now and craving this pizza... will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here during our trip and one of the BEST pizza I've had. I'm a pizza-holic and very picky when it comes to it but this place was worth it!  The slices are pretty big and are reasonable in prices as well. Got to meet Gary from the kitchen and he was a pretty cool dude, thanks Gary for attending us! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"BOMB ASS PIZZA! Really amazing pizza. If you're downtown definitely check this place out. Gave it 4 stars cause the customer service from the blonde chick was crappy. Standoffish. Other than that, great pizza!"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere here is nice, what matters most to me is the pizza, considering it's the reason we came. The large number of positive reviews indicates I am likely in the minority, but I was really disappointed in the slice of their white pizza I ordered.  When I picked up the slice, the pizza had such a large pool of grease on top it almost seemed like they must have poured oil on it before heating it up. Then, biting into the pizza disappointingly gave way to a super chewy cheese experience (I'm guessing all the oil leeched out of the cheese, leaving the cheese as a deconstructed rubbery affair). Sadly, the flavor was bland to boot.  We did end up here after midnight, so who knows, maybe it's just an issue with the night shift. The only really positive thing I can say is that I started out hungry (having skipped dinner) and after eating the slice was satiated. But at $6 for a slice of rubbery white pizza I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive...and I mean that as a compliment...nothing pretentious here.  My hubby is a serious Evel fan so that's why I picked this one for him.  The pie was good...pepperoni was the best.  They were out of their root beer which sucked but not a huge deal...bet it is good though.  The only negative is the music was extremely loud.  We would go back fo sho!"}
{"text":"Trevor is THE bomb! He made the BEST bday drinks for me! Pizza was off the chain! BEST pizza in vegas! I NEVER eat the end of the crust but it was so good I had to ask for a side of ranch to dip it in."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. Some of the best pizza in Vegas. The food is great and the prices are so low you can't go wrong. Got two slices and two cocktails for 20$. (Slices are massive btw)"}
{"text":"Full Review can be found in the blog.  Opting to dine family style at the kitchen's discretion, a few Beers plus a punchy local Root Beer in hand, the first look at Evel Pie's product since their Grand Opening shows that the kitchen and their ovens have already improved substantially with a bit of seasoning, the multipurpose Dough used to make everything from Garlic Knots to Zeppole baking up with a good char and just the right amount of stretch plus a cornicione that bubbles just enough to let patrons know that nothing here is rushed, the crispiness and air pockets imparted by giving the yeast  enough time to ferment.  Offering both whole Pies and those by the slice, the former obviously a fresher choice though those arriving during peak hours are rather certain to receive a hot slice straight from the rack, it was with five different combinations of toppings that opinions were formulated of a Pizza that manages great consistency by way of good Ingredients and a 50/50 Mozzarella that is not applied overzealously, the \"Cheesy Rider\" and Pepperoni Slice with Cup and Char-style rounds always available for purists while \"Hog Heaven\" with housemade Barbeque Sauce plus Brown Sugar Bacon, Pulled Pork and Red Onions is more of an acquired taste, the \"Goblin Sausage\" taking the idea of 'Meat Lovers' pretty seriously with Pepperoni, Ham, Italian Sausage and Bacon while the \"Barry White\" Pie features puddles of Ricotta and Fresh Basil atop a light Garlic Sauce.  Smartly offering his own style of Meatballs as an appetizer, the three for $8 Orbs tender and supple in a pool of crushed Tomatoes, additional items from \"Evel's Sides, Salads, and Other Stuff\" include a Caprese with Fresh Mozz and good Balsamic that would not be out of place at most of the Strip's fine dining spaces save for its service in a take-home tin, the Pizza-joint staple Buffalo Wings a bit less surprising, though still quite good for those who are into such things.  Lingering over good music, great conversation and what was already plenty of food, it was with the dining room really revving up for business that Justin brought forth \"Evel's Giant Hot Pocket Rocket Calzone,\" the three Cheese blend inside what is literally a whole Crust folded over soon to generate a 'Cheesepull' that exceeded four feet of creamy texture and a whole lot of flavor while Vincent's now-famous Gluten-Free Pie arrived shortly thereafter, the \"Detroit-style\" Deep Dish subjected to a double ferment that has thus far limited the restaurant's capacity to keep up with demand for something that is not just 'Celiac-friendly' because it is trendy, but truly a passion project with a crispy edge and buttery softness that seems almost impossible to achieve without the elasticity typically associated with Wheat Protein.  Rounding out the night with 'Led Zeppole,' the obvious reference to a band who named themselves such because they figured the idea would quickly crash, Evel Pie's Dough defies the idea of a heavy Doughnut by generating small Puffs that emerge from the fryer light and virtually oilless, the powdered sugar dabbed-on as opposed to being dumped over allowing the yeastiness to come through while a sidecar of Chili Flake Honey is an idea so simple and satisfying that one wonders why they've never seen it before.  ****1/2Taking the concept for what it is, the marriage of a high-flying Daredevil's relics to a Pizza Joint circa 1972, Evel Pie has achieved a tremendous amount of success in under four months by pairing a passionate Pizza Man to an owner willing to take some chances, the answer to every New Yorker's prayers answered in a rather unlikely place with the only questions remaining just how much better the 'slice' can get, and what these guys will come up with next?"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, cool funky atmosphere that won't break the bank. If this is what you're looking for this is a place you need to check out. Bar staff is excellent and will create what you want or probably something better. Just off the Fremont experience it's the perfect choice for a low key evening. An added bonus is their window seating that allows you to enjoy all the inside and peek at the outside as those passer by's give you a little added entertainment! I can personally recommend the goblin sausage pizza. A-ma-zing!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to get here for months I follow you guys on the socials, as yochef1 I been to the last 3 pizza expos at the convention center,I actually live next door to it. I know all the big pizza guys in Vegas personally, and came to try your crust and was not disappointed, debbie and I ordered four different slices and we had a great taste test going and we just loved them all.The staff were very friendly and on Top of everything. Smiling faces all around the kitchen too, I love the vibe and I'll be back in the evening they drafts I'm interested in"}
{"text":"This is another well kept secret on Fremont Street. Food is tasty; bartenders are friendly, and a good vibe permeates this establishment. It is so good to get out of the pesky casino's and walk into a bar and enjoy some light hearted banter with bartenders and other patrons. Make this a stop when you are downtown. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great times, great pizza and great vibe!  Love the Evel Knievel theme! Had the rattlesnake sausage pizza... delicious!  Wife had the Barry White pizza; as the name implies, it's a white sauce pizza and super delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go have some pizza and a beer! I would highly recommend the slice with pulled pork on it - it was fantastic! Would come back for that for sure! Good sized slices as well and a cool atmosphere!   Only thing I'm not too happy with is that they advertise their signature pizza having rattlesnake sausage and mind you - the rattlesnake sausage tastes phenomenal but the slices have so little on them! There were like 3 little pieces on the slice.. the rest of the time I was eating a pepper pizza which I don't mind because I like that but if you're going to advertise that, give me at least 2 more pieces! Lmao I want more!   Would recomend going! Please try this place out."}
{"text":"Evel pie has an amazing staff, great prices and great security. They're consistent and always lively. I witnessed there security get called racial slurs and had beer poured on him (on a stab wound he got the night before mind you) just for keeping people out of the alley and he maintained his composer. He also rescued me from being hit on uncomfortabley out front. He rules. The bartender Mandy is a sweet heart, Gary make the best pizza and the manager is amazing as well. I'll be coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"I give Evel Pie 5 stars because I love the atmosphere, the design, the pizza, the beer etc.   I eat the vegan and veg'd out pizzas.  The vegan meatballs are absolutely addicting and delicious. Also plenty of beer options to wash it all down.   I love this block of Fremont Street a great location for spending several hours."}
{"text":"Honestly, the pizza is great. One of the most flavorful slices of cheese pizza I have had the honor of eating within my twenty-something years of life. Much of an improvement from the previous F. Pigalle and Radio City Pizza tenants before. Loved the decor, the prices seemed right, et cetera.  Had to take off two stars for the staff. Considering the spot opened up six days ago, why was the staff so rude? They had the attitude of hipsters who had been there before Beauty Bar opened up. Hate to pull the hipster card but the staff was rude when we were trying to make conversation. Didn't offer us drinks, didn't greet us, wouldn't talk to us, saying we literally were too lively for them at 9pm just ordering food and no alcohol, complained about us taking too long, etc. At least if you're going to act like you're too great for everyone... earn it first. Honestly between Evel Pie and Pizza Rock, I would rather go back to the OG Pizza Rock and have friendly service."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall pizza joint with great prices on draft beer. They had a special going for a slice of pizza and draft beer for $5."}
{"text":"Few things to say.  #1) Evel Knievel memorabilia on walls is pretty cool.  #2) Pizza. (I'm from NJ but live here in Las Vegas now). Not too shabby. Not too cheap. But not too shabby. Good thing is, you CAN order by the slice.  #3) Girls at bar not only look a little \"rough\", they also act it. Not too amicable. Whatever.  #4) $5 slice & beer is pretty cool.   Overall a pretty good experience but I won't be bringing the wife here soon. She's neither a fan of Evel Knievel nor nose piercings, pink eyebrows and face tattoos.  Good concept but I'd really want to have service with a smile. And for that, I DONT CARE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.  51 yr old male."}
{"text":"From the mind of the creator of Golden Tiki....  Actually, that's true.  Brandon Powers has teamed with Evel Knievel's son and other folk to make a new (and only I've seen) themed pizza place downtown.  It's next to where Insert Coin(s) used to be, and is literally a hole in the wall, as any good pizza place should be.  Again, as with Tiki, \"theme\" is key here, and the walls are fully decorated with memorabilia of the daredevil. One of the more impressive aspects is that the place feels dated and lived in.  It comes straight from the late 1970's-early 1980's, and feels like it's been around forever, which is a good thing, in my opinion.  Where so many things look sparse/artsy and pristine around Vegas, this place has some rugged personality, accompanied by a classic rock soundtrack.  The pizza is decent.  I'd like to try a few more varieties, but what I had was authentic \"pizza dive\" food.  Coupled with the numerous beers on tap, again, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that this was a place that you grew up with.  The arcade machine was broken, so that was a bummer, and again, I want to try a few more varieties of pizza (we had pepperoni and sausage with a salad), but the place had a relaxed vibe, and made me a little nostalgic for my youthful eating experiences.  Like Tiki, there's a lot to look at around the place, albeit smaller, so it's worth exploring.  It's a place that you've been to in your past, yet still probably haven't yet.  I look forward to sampling some of their other selections the next time I make my way there."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Like, really love pizza. A coworker found out I was doing Vegas for my birthday and said, you gotta go to Evel Pies on Fremont! Well, after a late night walking Fremont and drinking at the piano bar, pizza was on my mind and we headed straight to Evel Pies! It's cool with a hole in the wall, divey feel. The big, New York style slices were ready to go, only a quick wait for a warm up. I love a good cheese slice so that's exactly what I had. It was just as perfect as I wanted it to be! We took ours to go but there's plenty of seating, music, and drinks available so next time we'll probably sit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza scene! Evel brought back the pizza-by-the-slice atmosphere of the east coast by friendly staff and a huge beer selection! Can't wait to come back for the live bands!"}
{"text":"Tastey vegetarian pizza.. delicioso! Cool ambience, looking forward to going back and trying their salads. Fun place to hang out too :)"}
{"text":"If you are vegan and/or gluten-free, EP is a must-try. I am both and their proprietary, award-winning gluten-free crust with Daiya brand vegan cheese is the best I've had in a restaurant. The deep-dish crust is light and fluffy with a slight doughy chewiness to it that arguably rivals the best non gluten-free crusts. My non gluten-free dining companions ordered the gluten-free crust and even they loved it. I will undoubtedly be dining here at least once per trip when I'm in Vegas going forward. I'd highly recommend this place to pizza lovers of all dietary preference."}
{"text":"The pizza was lacking in toppings, but that's just my taste.  Thin, crispy crust, and a fun atmosphere made this place worth the stop for me."}
{"text":"Had a pie and pitcher special with a couple of friends.  The service was fantastic as was the pizza.  The atmosphere was cool and casual. I will come back when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great people, along with a cool atmosphere. We work at the fire station near by and this is our favorite pizza joint. We are for sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"good pizza. friendly staff... but music a bit loud. but again you are in downtown of las vegas, everything is loud there."}
{"text":"This pizza was really good. The crust is amazing. For a high traffic touristy spot I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The theme is really cool too."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but we like our crust crispy not soft.  For a thin crust pizza it was a little underdone.  The flavor was excellent however.  Fun place, nice staff."}
{"text":"Are you an old Evel Knievel fan who happens to be hungry for rattlesnake pizza?  Well, then, my friend, you've come to the right place. The pizza is actually really good, though the rattlesnake was sparse on my slice."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than late night New York style pizza!  Service is friendly, open late. Pizza by the slice or a whole pie. You can get a cheese slice and a can of PBR for $6..  We've been here 3 times and I get something different every time. The basic cheese or pepperoni is satisfying. My favorite so far is the Barry White. Buttery flavor with a touch of basil. 4 different cheeses. Yum!  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I live downtown and loved this place but the last two times I've been I sat at the bar and ordered a slice and a beer and never get my slice. I have to remind the workers that I ordered a slice, yesterday I didn't even bother to ask I was over it.  The more than made good on their mishaps. Have been back a few times sense."}
{"text":"A must try in vegas, there gluten free pizza is among the best in the region, it is made from scratch to your order with what ever toppings you specify. Their hot wings are super good too. Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Came here last night for some food while wandering around Freemont street. There were five of us total. The service was super fast and friendly. We went up to the counter to order different slices and beer, and were told to sit and wait for our names to be called. We didn't have to wait long.  Their special which I did is a beer and a slice of cheese pizza for 6 dollars. It's a good deal, you get a pint of PBR and a big slice of pizza. The beer was nice and cold which was good. The pizza is obviously the star of the show. The crust was light and chewy and had great flavor to it. It wasn't too dense and the dough wasn't too much in relation to the sauce and toppings. The sauce was a red sauce that had a touch of sweetness to it. And they made sure the slice was super cheesy. None of the ingredient outshone another one. They all complimented each other very well.  I have to say I was impressed that even though we all ordered separately we all got our slices within a good timeframe so no one was waiting too long. I was lap impressed that when one slice came out a bit toasty on the edges the person behind the counter told us that a new one was being made but we could have that one while we wait for the other to cook. The toasty pizza wasn't even that toasty and we said that we didn't need another slice but within a few minutes another slice had magically appeared at the table. Of course we couldn't turn it down and it was definitely not wasted. It was definitely a great experience between the service and the food itself. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was late....we wanted a snack..... We got a slice at Evel pie. The place itself is very cute and the people who work there are friendly. The pizza slices have the same downfall as most pizza slices....they aren't fresh and they aren't quite the same when reheated as they probably were when they were fresh. The pizza was good, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Omg this place is heaven! We got the pepperoni and Italian sausage calzone and it was the most delicious thing I've tasted! We'll definitely be back when we're in town."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever received. I felt extremely uncomfortable sitting in line with the bouncer. Was not let into the bar because \"too many people are going to the bar and not the tables\" and \"they need additional identification\" although they let in my entire party in. Zero stars for making a customer feel UNWELCOME and like an outsider."}
{"text":"Ate here it was delicious. My friend Michael Spadoni recommended it. This is everything you could want in a New York pizza right downtown in Las Vegas. Plus the whole place is decked out in Evel Knievel memorabilia. Prices are fair and the slices are huge and the beer is flowing. The mix drinks are also delicious. I'll be back again next year."}
{"text":"Pizza is spot on. New York style with a twist. Rattlesnake sausage. Vinny and Olga are amazing. We have been looking for a good pizza spot since we moved here and this is it."}
{"text":"I'd had this place on my radar for a few years now. Somebody said \"Best pizza EVER!!\" and I was here to verify or deny the validity of that statement. It was dinner time, and I felt pizza would be a great dinner.  As I entered, I eyed the tent-sign at the door. It spoke of a six dollar beer and pizza deal. I was intrigued, and I felt like experiencing the six dollar beer and pizza deal for myself.      I walked up to the counter to check it out. I asked about the deal, and the lady behind the counter said 'it's a slice of cheese pizza and our house beer.'  I nodded and accepted. Six and some change later I had a receipt and they had my name. I found a table to sit down at and wait for them to call it.      Just a few minutes later, my name was called, and I retrieved my pizza and my beer. The beer was cold, and the pizza was hot. For six dollars, I was quite contented.  As I ate my pizza and drank my beer, I took in the place. I watched amusedly as a small child tried to play a very old arcade game. Doing a wee bit of research, this game is as old as I am! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt_Cycle (Just in case you want to know how to play it when you visit.)       The place seems to be a shrine to the Evel Knievel. Who was an awesome guy to have a shrine too. I'm not sure why. But there's a bunch of stuff dedicated to him. Portraits, statues, pinball machines, and a stunt motorcycle very old arcade game. Maybe this place was started by his relatives? Maybe this place was just a huge fan of the stuntman's work? I dunno. But it's a fun place to pop in for a six dollar beer and pizza.      I'll be back on my next trip out to Vegas. Maybe I'll get something else. But thanks!"}
{"text":"For sure 5 stars for me.   I love everything about it. First of all, slice of cheese pizza and  a PBR is $5. Their Happy Hour is a whole pizza and a pitcher for $20. Can't go wrong there.   Love the vibe inside. They have a couple window seats so you can enjoy your food and watch people walking down Fremont St  which let's be honest, can be quite entertaining.   Their pizza selection was good and I really liked the flavor. Tasted like an authentic slice. My love had a slice which had garlic knots as the crust! So delicious.   I love the downtown Vegas vibe and I look forward to coming here again. Awesome vibe + good food."}
{"text":"This was listed as one of best pizzas in downtown Vegas. Definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"More of a tourist trap than a pizza place. It took more than 15 minutes for my slice to come out. And all they were doing was heating it up. Also, they don't have Italian seasoning, garlic, or pepper flakes on the tables. This place is more about attracting tourists to spend money that it is about having a good slice of pizza. The slices were unreasonably thin. I got a cheese and a vegan slice and the vegan slice was just little bits of pepperoncini, olive, and onion on top. It's like they were thinking that people that don't eat meat or are vegan just like to eat less. All they had to do is put more vegetables on the slice and it might have been worth it. And they have the audacity to sell it for $6.50. And it's not like the cheese slices any better.  It hardly had any sauce on it and the cheese  wasn't even that flavorful. Again, less of a pizza place and more of a tourist trap. I don't think I've ever written a review on Yelp, but this place definitely motivated me to do it."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've had in Vegas. Love the atmosphere and the guys (and gal) working there are cool"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and ordered Grandma's balls and a Barry white pie.  The cashier got the order wrong and gave us garlic knots instead of the meatballs but the kitchen fixed it and made them for us anyway which I really appreciate.    The ambiance was pretty cool and they have a good lunch deal for a slice with a beer for 6 bucks.  It was a little loud inside but I can see why it is.    The pizza was outstanding!  My friend said it was probably the best pizza he's had in Vegas (he's a native New Yorker.). The other items were ok but the best.  If we ever came back it would be just for pizza."}
{"text":"What a fun place!  Great pizza w/ unique flavors to choose from.  You could spend a good 30 minutes looking at the memorabilia on the walls.  Good beer on tap and a full bar available."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on vacation, this place stands out as one of the better meals we had. My wife is picky as hell about pizza and she loved the food.  The sauce on these slices was really good and I ended up going back for two more slices! I stuffed my face, I had killed one of those big as drinks on Fremont so we had a pig out. We'll definitely hit this place up next time because it's hard to find quality food in that area."}
{"text":"The crunch, the gooeyness of the cheese, the Tang of the tomatoes the but  the pizza pie crust amazing..perfect grease coming off the pepperoni burning the roof of your mouth delicious. Nothing like a sexy man making a sexy pizza thank you Josh"}
{"text":"I just went in for the first time. I am a fan. Its a dive bar with good pizza. I had the Balls to the Wall and the Snake River. Both are 2 really great choices. Everything was fresh and the beer and cocktail prices are great. The bartender, Kahlie, had tones of personality that came through in a quick conversation. Did I mention it is dedicated to Evel Knievel? BOOM!   Will demo be back and will be recommending this one to my clients. 2 signature slices and a 16 oz beer for 12 dollars. can't beat it with a stick.   Great place. GO!!"}
{"text":"Totally legit pizza and I would know bring a pizza aficionado from New York!!  A little pricey but solid and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had three different vegan pizzas. The pesto, ricotta, and the marinara. Good lord the pizzas are incredible. The flavor and the crust is just amazing. There's no other pizza place in Vegas like Evel Pie! They are so freaking good. Hubby tried the vegan meatballs and said it was bomb. I love love love this place! Thanks for existing."}
{"text":"Came here on a early Saturday night. When I asked which pizza they're known for, the staff recommended I try a slice the World Famous Snake River Special. It has \"rattlesnake\" sausage which I was told is actually mixed in with peasant to improve the flavor. To me it tasted gamey and was okay, only had three pieces of sausage, very little toppings. The atmosphere is laid back and staff is friendly and upbeat. Recommend going with a group. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hoaky, campy, corny and stupid.  Expensive. Very expensive.  Good friendly service. Sweet as sugar bartenders.    Pizza and Evel Knievel is the theme here.   Full bar no gaming machines. Loud 60's and 70's music. Seemed like a mostly friendly gay and lesbian clientele so if you're homophobic you're still ok here.   Better places to visit close by."}
{"text":"EVEL PIE PIZZA ROCKS!  Tonight we stopped by to enjoy some pizza and support a few local music artist as well as pies for paws event.   The Pizza is so darn good, we debated on getting a whole pie or some slices so that we could sample a few of our favorites!  We opted for delicious slices of the following!  World Famous Snake River Special- mozarella, rattlesnake sausage, carmelized onions and roasted red peppers.  Barry White- mozzarella, pecorino, fontina and ricotta.   Hog Heaven- bbq sauce, smoked mozarella, fontina, pulled pork, man candy bacon, red onions.   Classic Pepperoni  Garlic deez knots- garlic, pecorino & parsley with their famous Evel's tomato sauce.  The pizza is always delicious, fun and flavorful!  My favorite Evel house specialty pizza is HOG HEAVEN, that yummy bbq sauce and pulled pork brings me to climax."}
{"text":"Great slice(rattlesnake)service and atmosphere are really good,can of Olympia beer reminded me of growing up in Montana,tasty!"}
{"text":"Ok so yesterday I had pizza on the strip and it was absolutely trash, I didn't even finish it and I love pizza when litt!! So tonight I hang out in freemont with friends and I partied hard, So of course I'm hungry and I need something greasy to eat up the liquor in my system !!!!! Anyways, I'm here now at Evel Pie, drunkkkkkk and eating pepperoni pizza, it's probably the best slice pizza in vegas!!! Prices are great ! I ordered a jack and coke which she served nice and hefty !!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza and good music. I had the Barry White and I really liked it. There was a pizza with rattlesnake sausage that I will have to try next time I go. The environment was really fun with lots of memorabilia to look at. This place serves pizza by the slice and whole pies as well and it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have spent many moments of my 10 years in Las Vegas in the Downtown area. I've spent most of that time eating my way through each and every new restaurant concept. Having a culinary degree, my joy comes from being a part of other chef's visions and culinary journeys. Evel Pie, not only for its aesthetic and novelty, blew me away. Nostalgic for the long lost past of Radio City, I couldn't hope for a better downtown pizza replacement.  The food...to die for....the prices....worth coming again and again.  The service makes it worth the time you'll spend waiting for a perfectly cooked pizza with top notch ingredients!  Kelly, Chelsea and Ivana are excellent at what they do all with histories in the Downtown and local bar scene. I've followed them from location to location and this bar and it's food so far has been my favorite.  Do yourself a favour and join them for a slice of pizza and a beer for 5$, or stay all night like I do for the customer service and good times all around."}
{"text":"Great pizza & strong drinks! Very authentic NY style crust. Love the Evel Knievel collection."}
{"text":"Evel is good baby!  At least that is what I heard from an episode of The Tick.  Man were they spot on.  Evel is good even if you are just a part time electrician!  Friendly staff, great atmosphere and music.  Great crust on the pizza.  We took some back to the hotel and fought over it for breakfast the next day.  Ordered the 6 pack (6 toppings) and loved the fresh jalapenos they have.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good pizza by the slice. It is thin sliced, which is my preference. It definitely hit my craving for a good slice. They have fun madness for theirslices, like goblin sausage, that appealed to the nerd in me. The staff and decor are fun."}
{"text":"So far I'm a fan of the very good pizza served at Evel Pie. Decently priced slice shop. All the flavors are great and they offer a nice selection of beer in tap.   This shop should do well in this area."}
{"text":"I got the cheese vegan pizza. It was really good. I haven't had a lot of vegan pizza in my life so I don't have that much to compare it to. Only in Los Angeles which was good as well, and popUp pizza which is also around this area downtown vegas, the thing I like about pop up pizza is that have a specialty vegan pizza so they don't charge you per topping like this place does. But it's really good and could crave a pizza craving from a newly vegan like me. Subtract one star only because the place was kind of a hassle to get to. Having to find parking, and it's downtown on a busy street. It was kind of a ridiculous hassle to get to just for a take out pizza. If I hadn't all ready paid for it online I probably would have just left like I don't want it that bad...  lol.. if they want to or other business in a high traffic areas want to sell take out more, they should probably have a back drive threw area, or advertise that they will send someone out so you can just drive threw and pick up your order if you all ready paid for it. So people don't have to find parking, or deal with the hassle of large crowds cause I was not trying to be social at the time I was just trying to get take out and go back home. Lol.. this would be a cool place to hang out w friends tho. It has a hipster vibe thing going for it. It's a cute little spot. And they have vegan pizzas that actually taste good, even just cheese. I got cheese w extra cheese ate a couple slices then saved the rest for later and added my own vegan toppings on each slice later. FYI they sell vegan pizza as well as a lot of other vegan things at sprouts grocery store. For newly vegans who don't know."}
{"text":"Pizza is fire my husband and I had slices of balls to the wall and a side of buffalo wings had a chance to try snake river pizza with rattle snake meat employees are attentive a must try in Vegas right off Fremont street"}
