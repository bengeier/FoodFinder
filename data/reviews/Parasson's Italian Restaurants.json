{"text":"I have to agree with Maryq. 

We love Parasson's and it's a local institution, but to be fair, we've noticed the portions have gotten a lot smaller and has anyone else noticed the prices are not low like they used to be? For cheap pasta, we can overlook a lot...but Parasson's ain't the deal it used to be in the 1970s and 1980s when there literally were lines out the door.

C'mon guys, it's pasta...you ain' fooling anybody with the smaller portions and bigger prices."}
{"text":"My grandmother really likes it there and while the service was good the food wasn't. One would think that because the restaurant isn't a major chain that they would have better homemade food. Its not a place that I would return to."}
{"text":"This is a local hole in the wall that's a good place to take the family. Portions are good, the food is good but not  great. My kids really liked it. None of us were able to finish our meal, so we had plenty of leftovers to take home. They do have beer, and they do take credit cards."}
{"text":"Sound Italian food in an attractive setting with attentive staff and sound service. Imagine a tudor home with a four-season room that has been turned into a restaurant and you have the idea. Basic Italian classics, nothing adventuresome; good quality ingredients and preparation, although occasionally the pasta is not sufficiently hot. Do watch so the occasional shortcuts, such as frozen chicken tenders being used both for the kids meals and the chicken parmesan (what's with that?). Cheesy muzak--hope you like mob movie soundtrack. Aims to please families and an aging clientele. Short story: good food, attractive setting, good service, and a couple quirks. Worth a try, and a good value overall."}
{"text":"They don't have a basic marinara sauce that is vegetarian.  I'm having a salad and will never come here again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is all about nastalgia.  The food is not great.  But it's been around forever and the prices used to be really cheap.  That is no longer the case.  In my opinion it's not worth it."}
{"text":"New to the area, wife was in need of a spaghetti fix, so we stopped in.  Will be back!  Her spaghetti was great; i had the left-overs next day.  My baked lasagna was outstanding.  Good service, good food, good prices, definitely a 'family' kind of place.
Hint -- perhaps the reason 'the place hasn't changed in years' is that they've found what works?"}
{"text":"This is another Stow restaurant in need of a makeover. The decor is tired. The food was delicious and the server was good and had refills there when the glasses went empty. My only complaint is that we got there before they closed but the teenage kids were trying to clean up and get out of there. There was a server using a broom on the carpeted floor with in five feet of our table. Another teenager was using a electric sweeper inthe room next to ours. Would I go back? Of course!!!"}
{"text":"Now I remember why we hadn't gone back in five years.  Service so bad they even mess up your remade order and the manager argues with you over paying for stuff you never got.  But if you have several hours to kill and you like being abused, you should enjoy it.  Oh, yeah.  Bring your own water.  Apparently they don't provide refills."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price!  We go for lunch at least four times a month and you can't beat the value!  The garlic bread is delicious and the personal size pizza's are perfect.  My only complaint is the outdated d√©cor, but if it keeps the prices low - who cares!!  Great wait staff too - very attentive and friendly :)"}
{"text":"Had the pasta with meat sauce and meatball sub here!  SO good homemade Italian food sauce was great portions are very good! cheap way to get a homemade Italian fix!"}
{"text":"I went on so many dates here with my college boyfriend - I think we kept the place in business! Nah, their really consistent Italian food did that just fine. I had the baked cheese ravioli or baked lasagna when  we came here, the salad and bread came with the meal as well. Super casual, low cost, which made it great for college students (like us). It's great for families and groups."}
{"text":"So I come from a different place as I write this review because I used to work at Parasson's. However, it was more than 5 years ago, and they have redone their menu since I left. So, getting that out of the way, I will say that you get what you pay for at Parasson's. It's cheap, Italian food. But I still really enjoy it. Not healthy for you at all, but what you can expect with Italian food in general? I was really disappointed when they got rid of the ravioli from the menu -- it was my favorite. However, I do still enjoy the baked noodle dishes as well. The sauce has a little bit of a sweet aftertaste, but I don't mind it at all. (My mom, however, does not like the sauce and likes to stick to their white pizza). They also make a good pizza, which is what I got last time I got carryout there. It isn't overly greasy, and it's super fluffy with a good crust. They now have personal, medium and large pizzas, whereas they only had small and large when I worked there. 
The garlic bread has also changed since I left, and at first I was disappointed, but it's still good (and as unhealthy as ever). But delicious. My personal, traditional deluxe pizza was delicious, and way too much food. (Leftovers for lunch today!). And my salad with their house dressing was also good. Overall, if  you're looking for Italian food on a budget, Parasson's is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids!!! The food is always very consistent.  They offer good food, large portions and good prices. The servers are awesome. Usually college kids but they are excellent! 

I recommend the white pizza. The lasagna is really good too. 

Kids meals are very affordable and include the drink and a dessert of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. 

They do not serve beer/wine anymore. So if you are looking for a date night with booze, this isn't it. But if you are looking to fill your belly and not spend a ton of money... This is it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!  It's inexpensive, it's fast and the servers always polite and friendly.  Their hours are a bit early for closing but I appreciate the place for what it is and what it offers.  I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good food 
Huge portions
Big enough you can share 
I am a big guy who eats and I am not able to finish my pasta dish
Expensive to eat there but portions are huge

Left money once on the table cause I did not need change and left.
Sometimes waiting for a waitress to take of the bill can take awhile! 
You know to pay for my meal and left tip.
Was chased down in the parking lot for not paying!
Is there a rule that states I must pay at the counter? And check your table before jumping to conclusions.
It is a sit-down establishment so I don't see the need for the counter unless you need change but hey 
Small problem just a little annoyed is all"}
{"text":"Great lunch here today! I enjoyed the Meatball Sub (took half of it home), along with Italian Wedding Soup, and a glass of their house cabernet, and of course, their delicious garlic bread. The total price only came to $15."}
{"text":"Really solid family Italian restaurant straight out of the 1970's - which is how long I've been coming here. Big, versatile rooms will accommodate large parties easily and super kid friendly. The old garlic bread is back and we ate our carb-lovin' weight in it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much an truck stop that servers Italian food.  The only thing I really like is the Hawaiian Pizza.  I order some cheese raviolis on the side last visit and I am certain that there pasta is not made fresh.  The service was good and the place was clean which helps. This restaurant is used by us primarily when every other place is full.  It does the job but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Last time we were there I noticed a wet floor sign in the middle of the lobby....on a carpet."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Very clean.   Only neg restroom downstairs.   Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Parasson's is a sentimental favorite for me. Growing up in nearby Tallmadge, my group of pals spent EVERY autumn Friday night of our high-school years (at least once we could drive) at this location. The endless garlic bread and dirt-cheap prices for solid Italian-American food were the draw back then, but almost twenty years later I find myself returning for killer take-out antipasto salads and such when I'm in town visiting the family. Still an very honest value for a solid meal so I still hold Parasson's in a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"I love this place my family and me eat there at least once a week. My dad, aunt and uncle use to work there when they were in high school. Granted its in dyer need of a makeover the food is still really good and it's a good place to have a family meal"}
{"text":"Eating dinner in the \"sun\" room during a thunderstorm is one of my favorite luxuries in life... how long have I been doing that? How long has it been since I have done that?  I am NOT admitting that... the word \"decades\" is enough :-)

I hope that the quality isn't slipping... we closed the joint on a weeknight and the Italian Wedding Soup was gummy... but the pasta and garlic bread was great!

The service was also spot on.. with frequent refills... so 1 star deduction for the soup and crossed fingers for the next visit.

I sooooo miss the mega sized meatball... the 2 smaller ones were still good... but I soooo enjoyed slicing and dicing and portioning.

The bathrooms are still not wheelchair accessible, but there is a spiffy take out area now... as long as you can get up some steps."}
{"text":"Parasson's is an institution in Stow. It's been here since 1974 and used to be The place to go, often with an hour or more wait to get seated. That is no longer the case, you now get seated right away, but this is not because of any negative change, but mainly because Parasson's is no longer the only game in town. The food is good. It is unpretentious Italian food. There is no vegan, there is no organic, there is no fluff. What there is is tasty food made with butter and cheese and garlic and all those good things; and served in large portions at a good price. Their antipasto salad is very good and the garlic bread is phenomenal. Anything on their menu is a good choice. You won't leave here hungry, disappointed, or broke."}
{"text":"Just ordered Chicken Parm for the family. It is inedible someone put a half of box of salt on this awful stuff. I have not went there for 25 years now I remember why."}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed in years. Well, the food hasn't. The prices have. I remember when you two people could eat for less than $12. 

I digress. Same friendly service and same basic, tasty Italian food. Just as I remembered it."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the good reviews it makes me wonder about some of the people living around here and their understand of what good is. But I do have to admit growing up my family had an Italian restaurant. That being said the experience my date and I had was terrible at best. The service was amateurish and the place wasn't all that clean. At worst we both had different dishes and we both experienced Montezuma's revenge at some point in the early morning after our not so wonderful dining experience.

If I could give a negative star I would. Parrasson's is a blight in the dining world."}
{"text":"Decent food at a good price.  The atmosphere is OK, but you don't go here for the atmosphere.  You go there for the portions, service and great prices.  They deliver never ending garlic bread that will fill you up before the food comes.

They don't serve alcohol and at one time they were \"cash\" only, but I think that has changed.  I love ordering their rigatoni and salad for birthday parties.  For $30 you get enough food to easily feed ten and still have left overs!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed a bit in nearly 35 years.  I kinda like knowing that you can still get inexpensive eats served up in a quick fashion. Same big basket of garlic bread and the creamy Italian dressing for the basic salad that accompanies the basic bowl of spaghetti that I remember as a kid.  Cheaper than Olive Garden and good place for kids.  

If you have mobility issues be forewarned the bathrooms are downstairs and there is no elevator."}
{"text":"This is a local gem, a family owned restaurant selling good food at a reasonable price.  The original restaurant was opened in downtown Akron, and multiple locations surrounding Akron soon thereafter.  The menu is basic: salads, sub sandwiches, pizza and create your own pasta (which includes side salad and garlic bread).  Portions are generous and you can easily order a meal for less than $10 and come away satisfied.  The sauce is good, not unforgettable, and the meats and pasta are well prepared.  The salads are large and contain fresh vegetables.  The house creamy Italian dressing is good.  Service is very attentive and friendly.  Overall, worth a visit for some solid, family, Italian food."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant for inexpensive, Americanized Italian food and yummy pizza. The service is generally decent and the food is pretty good. The place can be hit or miss with atmosphere. There are always a ton of kids there, so be prepared for that. The place is great for takeout, too, if you don't want to dine in."}
{"text":"I don't come often anymore, as I said in my previous review, so I didn't know the menu had changed. Julia, my millennial waitress, asked me if I needed a minute before I even opened the menu, but I knew I just wanted the small spaghetti so I ordered. I was surprised a salad didn't come with it anymore, but they aren't very good anyway, so ok. I was shocked when she brought out the spaghetti--it was in a small, child-sized bowl. I tried to say something, but she walked away. I saw on the bill that it was a side order of spaghetti. Did Julia say that before she gave the order to the kitchen? Of course not. I am so tired of millennials in the work place who have no clue that going through the motions of working isn't the same as actually doing the job."}
{"text":"Cute little place. The food is soooooooo good and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. Pizza is delicious. My create-your-own pasta was excellent as well. I created my pasta using penne pasta, marinara and Alfredo sauce, mushrooms and I had them bake it. Yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My office is close so we have been there a few times for lunch. The restaurant is dated and needs a huge facelift. The different rooms are cool, but everything is just old and outdated. Last time we went there the menu seemed ridiculously small. It seemed like they took a lot of stuff off the menu, and basically just had salad and plain pastas. They only had 1 salad dress too besides oil and balsamic. Not sure if they're trying to save money or what but the small menu combined with the atmosphere...i probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, sandwiches, soup, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really enjoy the Parasson's in Barberton and we used to frequent the one in Canton when it was there. Since we haven't seen another Parasson's in ages, we wanted to try it. Folks, it's just not good. 

When you walk in the door, you're greeted with dirt and the doors and walls that need painted. The smell when you walk in the second door is enough to make your stomach churn. As you look around, you notice all of the dirt in the corners and bottom of the walls/furnishings. The room straight ahead was filled with about 5 different employees just sitting there waiting for something to do. It looked like an employee breakroom and does not give a good impression. 

We ordered and was served by a nice server, and the service was very good. The food was another story. I just ordered a pizza, which was adequate, nothing worth paying for (I did, don't think I'm one of those people that complain about the food just to get something free).  The other diner with me ordered the spaghetti and she couldn't even eat most of it. I tried it and understood why. The sauce tasted like it came from a Chef Boyardee can.  It was nothing like the sauce we are used to from the Parasson's in Barberton.

I mentioned to the manager that the employee breakroom look did not make a good impression and he just said ok. Not that I was looking for any apology or anything, but I'm not sure he could/would even consider changing it."}
{"text":"Some of my earliest restaurant memories are from this restaurant. My family used to come all the time and now it is a tradition to come with my friends from high school when we all get together. The food is delicious but simple. The garlic bread is the best and they have the best creamy italian salad dressing I have ever tasted. It is very casual and pretty cheap but that doesn't make it any less good."}
{"text":"One of the many reasons im glad i don't live in stow anymore. I was not a fan of their food. I see alot of people saying inexpensive but you get what you pay for. If you have small pockets and low standards you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Yummy, inexpensive Italian food with little to no wait.  Very casual.  Their baked lasagna is awesome!"}
{"text":"The kind of place where the regulars have been coming in for the past 40 years. Parasson's is stodgy Italian dinning straight from the 70's (with matching decor!). If you're looking for heavy sauces, breaded meat, and a thick melted layer of cheese over everything you order, then this place is for you! 
Now, there is some good to Parasson's. The service was courteous and prompt, food was served hot and in a reasonable time, and the portions are well worth the money. With an updated menu (and some new decor) this place could do pretty well but until then, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Parasson's? I love how this place has been here ever since I can remember, and the food and atmosphere are always the same. Sure, it's simple and predictable, but sometimes that can be a good, comforting thing. 

The prices used to be pretty cheap, but not anymore. That's the only down side. We used to always choose Parasson's because we always had good experiences, it was easy, and it was cheap, but I can't say we go there for the prices anymore."}
{"text":"Got Baked Lasagna and a couple other dishes in our party.  First of all why do they have Lasagna and Baked Lasagna as two different dishes?  Lasagna is always baked and should always be served with melted cheese.  

I got Baked Lasagna and it came in a dish which had been under the broiler.  It was in a bed of sauce and a thin layer if cheese.  Overall OK but the pasta inside was a bit mushy and dense.. couldn't quite tell what the mix was between the noodles but it was different.

We tried the tomato based sauce and meat sauce.. both we OK not stellar.  The penne pasta was overdone and quite mushy."}
{"text":"It's been well over ten years since I last visited this restaurant so I decided to give it another try today. First off, many of the reviews on here are correct, this place hasn't changed at all in ten years. It wouldn't hurt to update the decor and menu.

I would also recommend that they change the name to Parassons Italian FAMILY Restaurant because that's who they're appealing to. At a nice Italian restaurant you won't find promotions on the table advertising root beer or lava cakes (it reminded me of Bob Evans). During my visit the staff came out to do a birthday song for the family next to us... normally that annoys the living crap out of me however this chant was pretty funny and the kids at their table seemed to really enjoy it. 

Our waitress was a really nice woman! She was very attentive, responded very politely to our questions, and she was super patient when my dad took forever to order. She even asked if I wanted a lemon with my iced tea (many waiters and waitresses don't ask). I can honestly say she was one of the friendliest waitresses I have ever met.

The food is okay. Don't come here with the expectations that you're going to be blown away, it's just average Italian food (and I don't blame the chefs). I think the Parasson family is content with their average (small) menu with no specials. If the Parasson family wanted to be creative they would revamp their menu, offer something that is unique and creates a buzz, but I don't see them doing that. Yes, their garlic bread is quite good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. And for those of you that gave this place a five star review, you obviously haven't been to a five star restaurant. 

The prices are very reasonable, it certainly appeals to a family budget. I noticed their menu doesn't show the prices for beverages. That deterred me from ordering any wine or beer. 

My overall review, it's a cheaper alternative than going to the Oliver Garden. If you have kids this would be the perfect place to take them. If you're looking to impress a date, I would definitely go somewhere else. I'm calling out the Parasson family to update their restaurant and menu, stop collecting the cash and start reinvesting it into your restaurants. Sure you're family owned and operated since 1960 but it won't last that way forever."}
