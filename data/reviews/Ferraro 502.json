{"text":"This is my go to pizza place in the Eglington/Chaplin area.  Great prices, quality food (no skimping on pizza toppings and things like bacon are actual Butcher thick cut bacon unlike that dehydrated bacon like flavoured crap you get at other places) and the staff a great too. My only complaint is the acoustics in the place. It's often filled with families and screaming kids and it can be really difficult to hear who you are talking to. If you would prefer less kids dining and hear yourself think, head over after 8pm or do what we do often now, get the pizza take out!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a group of 8 and it was definitely a treat. With so many options that sound delicious, it was hard to choose what to eat. I got the Pizza Dan, but made into a calzone ($15). They will turn any pizza into a calzone which is a bonus, so just ask. This thing is massive so it's worth sharing. It was stuffed with toppings and if you're a meat lover, this is a great option. The service was great and attentive, although slow at times with a lot of parties going on around the same time I arrived. Nonetheless, I was pleased. Our group also had the anti pasto ($14.50) and the carpaccio ($12), which were both delicious. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of the most amazing Italian places I've been too. Very cute, relaxing seating with a patio as well. Salads are huge and filling, very fresh. Pizza oven is used for amazing crisp and fresh pizza. Check it out, it's a great location with easy parking and no traffic"}
{"text":"First time here and found it disappointing. Food was ok but not much flavor. Gnocchi was really bland. Pizzas as well. Cesar was the only really good thing.  Service was indifferent."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a hot night and that was great for the breeze, while the inside had no a/c. Pizza is popular with a steady stream of people picking up takeout pizzas. Its a busy crowded spot with service that is fast - but don't go if you want a \"dining experience\". The pizza crust is thin and the toppings we had (#8) gave it a cheesy pesto salty flavor - all in a good way! Go for the pizza."}
{"text":"Was extremely disappointed with my Ferraro experience.
On a positive note, I will say the pizza my husband ordered was very good. However, don't order the Minestrone soup, it's awful. No flavour, tastes like dirty vegetable water with soggy vegetables. 
I think their main issue however is with serving staff. Our waitress was completely obtuse. She didn't provide us with spoons, so we waited roughly 7-8 minutes after soup was served for cutlery. It took her the same amount of time to get me a drink. Then she totally confused the specials of the night and told me about a meal that wasn't even on the \"special board.\" Which I ordered. 
When it finally arrived, I sent it back assuming they had just sent someone else's order to my table - that's how incorrect the meal was. She had told me it was pasta with red sauce, instead it was white w/ asparagus. Since my order was so messed up, I wanted to get pizza instead - but she didn't come back to the table to retake my order for at least 10 minutes (she seemed overly concerned with the table BESIDE us) at that point, my party was half way finished their food! With the time it would have taken to make a new order, my friends would have been on dessert or even paying the bill! She didn't apologize, she didn't bring more bread to the table (like she initially said she would) or ask me if I wanted a refill on my drink. They also delivered beer to my friend which he didn't order. It was just a horrible experience. 
Not to mention the steep price of the bill. I didn't even eat (besides a $6.50 terrible soup) and we didn't order alcohol. The cost for my two other dining partners was $65 + tax! That is ridiculous. 
Also, the restaurant is incredibly loud, overly busy with screaming kids and has a feeling of disorganization. 
I will never eat here again and I will make sure to tell others the same."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times for dinner on a weeknight. It is a great Italian restaurant, if you go after 7 on a weeknight it's super easy to find parking and you won't find the place crammed. (I've heard weekends are super busy and unpleasant because of too many people around).

The food is really great! I've had both Pizzas and Pastas and they are both fantastic but I prefer the pizzas here. They have an amazing whole wheat dough for the pizzas that was so delicious! The service is friendly and attentive and it's definitely a great meeting place for friends and family. Not so much on the romance but there are tons of romantic places for dinner, head here for a nicer atmosphere for dinner with friends or a group!

I've also had the takeout from here and it was great. Surprisingly the portions were wonderful and their takeout containers are actually conducive to takeout, so you don't have to worry about soggy food or food jumping all over the box in a car ride when you take out! I definitely recommend for a fun night out with a couple people!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for two years and I can confidently say that Ferraro is the treat that keeps on giving. The owners and staff are friendly and the food is to die for. Portions are always generous and you won't leave disappointed. I also recommend you make your way down the pizza list! #fivestars"}
{"text":"Family friendly and i believe family-owned Italian restaurant in a great area of the GTA. The carpaccio is to die for and even though I usually want to skip appetizers, I can't resist the carpaccio.

I usually order the fusilli al pollo and it never disappoints for such a simple dish - it's really filling but don't forget to leave room for dessert!

My husband always loves their tiramisu - we usually get it to go !

Staff is always friendly and courteous and we always want to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is a favourite and regular haunt. The pizza is stellar and for some reason, I always end up getting the Gnocchi. The place can get really busy, testament to a loyal following and converting new people into regulars. Not fancy but perfect for the family or a casual date or night with friends. I have known people to come here every Saturday before the hockey game."}
{"text":"Pizzas are 4 star quality and what I would have if I returned with beer.  Pasta dishes and wine were just merely OK which keeps me from giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is a tried and true Italian eatery.  All the food is freshly prepared and everything is homemade, even the bread.  I've been going here for the past 20 years and the food is as good as the day they opened.  Yes they are busy on the weekends and reservations are a must.  If you have to wait the food is worth the wait.  It is a true family run establishment with the owners preparing the food themselves.  Will keep going back and recommending it to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast and efficient service, and family friendly. Their chicken Caesar salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Rating for update is a little generous.  The italian sausage topping for the pasta and pizza is quite awful.  I don't usually order it and would advise that anyone ordering pizza or pasta here avoid it.  There is a bit of a consistency problem in size of the pizza and obviously the quality and amount of the toppings (again-don't get the spicy/italian sausage).  Same goes for the mussels.  Not eating here as much as I used to."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The service is great and it is a calm and relaxing atmosphere - perfect for families. The food tastes like Nonna makes it; exactly what you want from an Italian restaurant. I have been here several times and am consistently impressed at the quality and affordability of the food. This continues to be my 'go-to' place for a nice dinner night out!"}
{"text":"This place has been our \"Family Occasion\" dinner spot for more than 10 years, Ive been here dozens of times.
1. Delicious food - doesnt matter what you pick - for me that is the hallmark of a true \"5\". 
2. Service is constant and helpful without being overwhelming.
3. Great for large groups, intimate dates, or dinner with a picky 3 year old (They've covered all three of those bases for me with great class.)

Before I forget: GET THE RIBS. The portion is man-sized, and their home sauce is a secret treasure."}
{"text":"If you want really authentic Italian cuisine, this is the place. Wood stove pizza is tops in the city. caprcio is awesome, service is great. No reservations accepted, if you come in at 7:30 on a Saturday, you will have to wait. But worth the wait it is.

Freshness is evident in all the dishes hear. It's a family business that two brothers run. They have obviously taken family recipes from Nona and mom.

Great place, the only down side. Not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Ferraro is amazing in all aspects. The owners are very nice and the food is amazing!!  
I love the fusili al polo and their pizza is very fresh. Very family friendly yet still has a simple bar if you're in the mood. they also have an outdoor seating which is very refreshing in the summer. 
My favourite italian restaurant in toronto!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week and I love it so much definetly my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Everyone must try!!!"}
{"text":"I used to work directly across the street from Ferraro so during the work week, I ended up here 3 out of 5 days.  This lead me to utilizing the restaurant as a last minute dinner spot as well.

For lunch, opt for the Griglia con Pollo salad.  I don't know what type of dressing they use but it is light and delicious.  The chicken is juicy, tender and falls apart in your mouth.  And the bread... oh the bread.  Warm, freshly baked bread makes my heart go pitter pat.

The wine list is good and there's a lot of variety so finding a bottle to accompany your dinner is a breeze.  You may find that the wine goes down too well here.  At least, I've found that... on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"My rating is really a 3.5, but that's not an option.
We used to come here all the time (read: weekly!), but then moved just slightly out of the area so came back this past weekend for the first time in about 5 years.  The service was as quick and efficient as I remembered.   This is definitely not a place for lingering and chatting...our mains were brought out before we were finished our salad.  I don't feel like they're being rude though - it's just the nature and atmosphere of the restaurant.  It's great for kids - both the speed of service, and what kid doesn't leave pizza or pasta!  My favourite pastas there are the Fusilli al polo, and the gnocchi...apparently the owners' mother makes the gnocchi herself every morning!"}
{"text":"Some of the very best pizza in town and always friendly service...I always look forward to the next visit!..."}
{"text":"Blustery cold day today and found myself in an area of town I normally don't frequent....looking for a Starbucks to sit and work and do a work conference call..... got a parking spot out front only to find the Starbucks is closed for a Reno ! OMG so walked back to the car and saw I parked right in front of Ferraro - so hopped in for something hot to eat ! 

Ordered tea with honey and milk - got a strange look, but she brought it right away...never came back for more hot water - shame :-(

Ordered potato and leak soup on such a cold day and the soup arrived being very hot, but very watery and not tasting like potatoes or leeks but rather chicken stock - odd and it had a bit of greasy film on top 

Ordered the half size of chicken caesar and it arrived pretty large with some nice hot cooked spiced pieces of chicken on top, perfect amount of dressing and every piece of lettuce had some. The server brought over fresh parmesan and black pepper and all in all the salad was just delish !!!  

The food being served on other tables looked amazing - think I might come back !!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  Thin crust, baked in a wood burning oven, topped with anything from roasted red bell peppers, marinated portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts and more!  Having been to Italy, the crust is the most authentic with the quantity of toppings being more Canadian-ized.  However, don't be fooled, there are authentic options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Over crowded, noisy. Average family style italian food. Poor, rushed, often rude service. The place is packed with local families and I just don't know why this place is as busy as it is, there are so many better options out there"}
{"text":"I like this place, not love but full four star \"like\"
the staff are so warm and accomodating, pizza is great... only place it lost points for me was because of the saltiness of some of their pizzas... maybe i'm too picky but when it's salty i can't taste anything!
Salads are fantastic, healthy portion and their chilli oil is so yum!!"}
{"text":"One thing I can say, is that the place has a very large menu and should have something for pretty much everyone. However with that said, the food is all pretty average based on our lunch experience.

The pizza was definitely the highlight of the experience, decent crust and wide variety of toppings. 
The breaded veal sandwich was a let down, with super thin cut veal and a very bland sauce. Decent sized sandwich but oh so flavourless.
I didn't try the pasta, but it looked very underwhelming and what I'd assume is pasta from a box.

So in summary... Stick to the pizza if you're coming here."}
{"text":"Eh. The pasta is something I could cook at home. The carpaccio was pretty good. The service is super friendly and nice which is why I gave this 3 instead of 2 stars. I got the seafood pasta but wouldn't pay $14 for it again. The seafood was not fresh, very mushy and fishy tasting."}
{"text":"Just had a family dinner there tonight on a Monday evening.
I was starving and ordered the pizza Canadese - the crust was nice and thin; very crispy, but interestingly enough, the toppings were hardly wilted down by any cheese - it was straight up mushrooms, green bell peppers and pepperoni.  The pepperoni was a little crispy, but my daughter can't stand mushrooms or bell peppers, so that was a bust.  The saving grace was the half order of pasta our waiter suggested - spagettini with their meat sauce.  It was fine for her nearly 3 year old palate, so I was pleased with that.  The bread was soft and chewy but not warmed.  The service was lovely - the silverware was not - the fork/knife/spoon all had shmutz on them.  I will not go back to Ferraro's because now I know with 100% certainty that I prefer the pizza at Terroni.  At the end of the meal, our waiter brought complimentary \"S\" cookies for our little girl and Double Bubble gum for my husband and myself."}
{"text":"This is a family friendly Italian place known for wood oven pizza.  They don't take reservations, but are able to move through a line-up at the front door surprisingly quickly.

You don't go here for ambiance, on a Friday night it is downright chaotic, but the serving portions are quite large and the service fast and friendly.

Had the eggplant parmesan and was impressed.  The bread at the table was average, but the olive oil tasted fresh pressed.  Wine list average.  The pizza was pretty good.

We go to this place with friends with young children because it is a fast, kid-friendly meeting place, that turns out a consistent product."}
{"text":"Hell yeah, this is a reliably good Italian eatery! They make my favourite veal parmigiana in the city, and the pizzas are great too. Other delicious options: Eglinton salad; butternut squash ravioli.

Brightly lit (not really romantic) this is a great bet for dinner with friends and fam."}
{"text":"First review of a restaurant so lets give this a shot:

My family and I decided to go to Ferraros on a Saturday night, BIG mistake. We realized this instantly as we walked in the front door only to find another 5 other parties stuffed into a tiny waiting area waiting for a table. After 15 minutes, we got a table only to find out that we were essentially sitting in a kids section. The atmosphere was incredibly loud and hectic. Waiters running everywhere. 

In terms of the food, we ordered a large Caesar salad. Now I don't expect a lot from a Caesar salad but you would expect an Italian restaurant to use a salad dressing that does not directly resemble a store boat Caesar.

The pizza we ordered was good, nothing spectacular and quite burnt on the bottom.

All an all we vowed we would stay away from the Ferraros dine in experience and opt for the takeout option if we dared venture back."}
{"text":"The service is quite good. The waiter is friendly. Food is not to par with the ratings. I believe the high ratings come from the generous portion sizes. The portions are quite big.

As someone who has eaten at many restaurants this one didnt live up to expectations. The bread is ice cold, the food is quite bland.  At the end of the meal they bring you bubble gum, the kind you has as a kid, rock hard.

For our dishes we ordered the portobello pizza which lacked flavour. My friend ordered the baked eggplant which had way 2 much sauce. For the pasta we had the chicken fettachini which the pasta sauce didn't stick out.

If you are looking for a great Italian place to eat that is at the same price range with better tasting food. Go to seven numbers 2 doors down."}
{"text":"We got pizza for pick up and it was absolutely amazing. Very reasonably priced for delicious gourmet style pizza. Would have spent a little less to go to one of the usual pizza delivery joints. This was so much better! Some on the best yummiest pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ferraro 502 is a popular Italian restaurant in midtown Toronto. In the evenings, it is usually very crowded.

We went there for lunch and ordered the cozze seducente and the antipasto for appetizers. We had the pizza con pesci and j and j pasta special for our mains.

We enjoyed the cozze seducente and the antipasto. The mussels came in a light tomato broth.

The pizza was very good. But it was very strange to see mussels shells on a pizza. My brother also like his pasta dish.

The waitress was very nice and charming.

Would we go back? Probably as there isn't that nice restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here for lunch when I used to work in the neighborhood. Now I still come back occasionally for their Calzones. This place get really busy at night but their staffs are still very efficient. 

Like I said, I love their calzones. And one trick is that you can order any specialty pizza into a calzone, even though It might not be in the menu. Also l, their pepper oil is very good. If you are up for spicy food, ask for it."}
{"text":"I have been coming here my entire life with my family.  Great food, good atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff and overall an awesome value. Good job Ferraros!"}
{"text":"Sat down and it took 10 mins just to be served water. Was never given a refill after that. Ordered the Bruschetta Tradizionale which was bland. Asked for salt, which was never brought to our table. Ordered the Cozze Seducente in a white wine sauce which tasted flavourless. As mains, we ordered the Veal Parmigiana which tasted alright and the Penne Salmone which tasted so fishy that it must have been spoiled. When asked if the salmon was fresh, we were told \"Uh... Um..  Usually\" by a young waitress. We also ordered the Fettuccine alla Romantini which tasted bland. Literally took three bites out of it and set it aside. The waitress took the Penne Salmone off the bill but didn't offer to take off the Fattuccine allla Romantini, even though it was basically untouched. No manager came by to apologize for the meal that was taken off or just to check on us. It was a disappointing night at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't usually write a review after the first visit, but I must say the courting period with Ferraro lasted only minutes and I have a feeling this will be a long and fulfilling relationship! I know it's wrong (VERY) wrong to say I love you after the first date, but Yelp did such a great job in setting me up w/ Ferraro that I had to pay homage asap!

I arrived here at around 8:30 on a Saturday night and found the restaurant to be bustling with locals and families. Nevertheless we were taken care of right away and seated at a prime location with a view of the old-school wood burning oven, kitchen, bread counter, and a TV showing the Leaf's game! The service continued to impress with the waiter wasting no time in suggesting a few wine options and providing a basket of freshly cut bread. This is a good point to mention that aside from our own very personable waiter, we were serviced by at least 4 other people who filled our glasses, replaced our bread, and took away empty dishes almost on queue! 

On to the food, it should be mentioned that Ferraro is neither your over-the-top, innovative, 2 pieces of gnocchi per plate restaurant, nor the four pounds of spaghetti served with fist sized meatballs joint! Fortunately they have been able to skip both of these Toronto-Italian cliches and provide some fresh home-style cuisine! 

The carpaccio and ravioli were both decent, but what stood out for group was the pizza and Griglia salad! 
The salad includes a generous portion of tender chicken breast drizzled with a tangy vinaigrette, creating a fresh taste when combined with spinach and yellow peppers! The two pizzas we tried (Portobello and Romantini), did not have as much cheese as you would be used to in Toronto, but I saw this as an advantage of exchanging greasiness for other fresh ingredients! The portobello was topped with peppers, two kinds of cheese and juicy slices of mushrooms and artichoke and it was in my opinion much better than the Romantini (which was still good). The thin crust was very tasty and cooked perfectly.

In summary, some of the entrees stood out more than others (as is expected with such a large menu), and the bread was nothing to write home about, but importantly everything tasted super fresh and was well prepared! Service was impeccable and we were surprised that they were able to balance chatting w. the customers with very quick service! 

One friendly hint that the spicy chilli oil Ferraro serves up puts any I have tried so far at Thai/Chinese restaurants to shame! Use with discretion!"}
{"text":"About as good as it gets for reasonable Italian. 

North York is spoiled with this staple. Delicious oven cooked pasta, clever pastas (try the 4 cheese), nice fresh lightly and cleverly dressed salads."}
{"text":"The pizza here is as good as it gets when it comes to stone cooked pie. The entire experience is worth checking out. It's never not bumping. A great selection of pizza and other foods that you would expect in an pizzeria. 

We have been about 4 times since moving into the neighbourhood and will absolutely return soon."}
{"text":"More like 3.5, but I'll round up! I liked the casual atmosphere of this place, and the waiters were very nice when we came here on a Thursday evening after a super late day at work. 

My pizza (Sofia - smoked bacon, mushrooms, and onions) was great, as was the (very boozy!!) tiramisu. Neither of us, though, loved my boyfriend's choice (Fettuccine alla Romantini), which was pretty bland.  The portions are generous for the price, and for that, I'll probably come back again when I'm looking for something a little more casual than many of the Italian restaurants in the area."}
