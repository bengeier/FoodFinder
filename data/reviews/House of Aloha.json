{"text":"My son and I were looking for something to eat between baseball games and came across this establishment. We were not disappointed!!! Right when we walked in the atmosphere was filled with Aloha. Great customer service and great food!!! We will definitely be coming back here whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Hawaiian food. Loco Moco as good as the rainbow drive-in! The owners are very friendly and the service is excellent! You got to try this place..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, great food and atmosphere, prices are good, deff a good amount of food for the price, they offered some samples to us which were amazing I'll be having the Teri beef next time, I had chicken katsu lunch special (which was awesome!) presentation of the food was really nice also, will deff be back and gonna spread the word!! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"House of Aloha has amazing local grinds. The customer service is beyond the best. The menu prices is awesome with huge portions. Love House of Aloha!!!"}
{"text":"The perfect name for this little Mom & Pop establishment! Upon walking in, you're greeted by either the smiling, satisfied guests or the friendly cashier. Very simple place with little decor, but don't be fooled by the simplicity of the interior design because the food is packed with flavor.  There was an option on the white board for the chow fun & katsu combo, unfortunately after I ordered it the cashier told me that the chow fun wasn't ready, and asked me if I would like the fried noodles instead (she said \"They are better!\") so I couldn't say no! My husband got the teriyaki chicken combo which comes with two scoops of rice and Mac salad.  Fried Noodle & Katsu Combo (5/5): Otherwise known as \"fried saimin\" to some other \"locals.\" Very good! I shared it with my daughter, who loved it and same with my husband! Very good, the right about of flavor without being too salty as some other places do it & I loved the little pieces of spam and green onion sprinkled in there. The katsu was very crunchy & I'm not big on katsu sauce, but theirs was pretty good.   Teriyaki Chicken (3.5/5): Perfect sauce to meat ratio! Nothing extraordinary about this dish, my husband always gets something like this everywhere we go. But, a little bit of his chicken was not cooked thru and bleeding, hence the rating.  Side Mac Salad (4/5): I'm not a huge mayonnaise person, which is funny for a review on Mac salad. I feel like it could have used a little more salt, but otherwise still good!  Can't wait to try this place again, especially all the other foods that other Yelpers are raving about. The food was good, but the service really makes this place the House of Aloha. The chef even peeked his head out and threw a \"shaka\" to us as we were making our order. Don't let the small place fool you, you'll feel welcome local or not!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch and was actually very surprised. This place is cute clean great friendly staff! The food was delicious. I got a small plate but didn't end up finishing it because it was a lot for me. I highly recommend this restaurant. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Was driving down the street hungry, when their banner caught my attention!  Awesome place!  Great people that make you feel like ohana and the food is \"onolicious\"!  My kids and I all tried a different plate and all left fat and happy!  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I came in from out of town from the Seattle area and was in the area and found this place with high rating on Yelp. I'm glad I went in the food was amazing and friendly service. The food came out fast and a large amount of food. The restaurant and restroom was very clean. When I come back I will bring my customers in for lunch."}
{"text":"You can't eat local kine Grindz without the aloha! This place is filled with aloha and onolicious food! Their Shaka Fries and PORK HASH is a must! Oh my gosh that bbq pulled pork on those Shaka fries ohhhh my gosh so good! You must visit this place and see/try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Woah! Now this is some good local grindz! Ono! Deff got that Mom and Pop shop feel. My family and I were starving, so I wanted to try a bunch of different stuff. We tried: manapuas, portuguese sausage fried rice, spam and fish cake saimin, combo plate (with kalua pig and cabbage, Teri chicken, and Shoyu chicken) and butter mochi for dessert. Great vibe walking in and when I asked what they had for dessert, I was offered a sample of their butter mochi. I got the small butter mochi to save off eating the whole delicious order to myself. The manapuas were so soft and fresh! I wish there was a little more meat in the fried rice. I felt like there was hardly any. Still good, though. Kalua pig was amazing. It's so hard to find good kalua pig in Vegas and I'm glad I found a spot near me that does it right!"}
{"text":"Never had service like this before. 10/10 there was so much care and thought put into our order, which is really weird because normally you get what you get when having food delivered. We have found out new place for amazing grindz! ALOHA"}
{"text":"I love this place allot when I do get that Hawaiian food crave I just go to house of aloha the food is good and they are very ohana once you walk thru the door. Always happy to help you and small kine talk while the food is being made everything there is made fresh too. Also you meet other people from different island so hot this place up they have good and the best thing we dont need to drive across town for Hawaiian food. So dont take my word for it go check this guy's out."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! The food is genuine Hawaii. Service was wonderful, very friendly and helpful. This is a definite stop!"}
{"text":"First thing we did after we landed in Vegas was find a Hawaiian restaurant. We yelped Hawaiian food and decided to try House of Aloha.  We were so pleased that we did! Let me tell you the pork hash delish! Believe they make pork hash, manapua and pastele. We ended up buying all of the pastele they had so we could give to our families here in Vegas.  If you're in Vegas make a pit stop here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I've ever had!! We had the beef teriyaki bowl and spam musubi. You have to  come try it!! The owners are great."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the   Pork Hash (kinda like big pork shu mai's) Breakfast combo (Spam, portuguese sausage, 3 eggs, and rice) Omelette Chow Fun (It's not the thai/chinese style chow fun flat noodles) Katsu   Overall, we thought the Pork Hash, Breakfast combo, and Katsu were really good. The Breakfast combo was really delicious because the spam was cooked nicely and tender, not over fried or dried out. The rice was perfect; some places make the rice mushy, but this was great!  The omelette was good and fluffy. The Chow Fun was good but just a different type of noodle than I was expecting. (They are thicker than the flat chow fun noodles, and very chewy which I like)  Will definitely be going back soon to try more stuff!!!!!"}
{"text":"If your ever on rancho (north side) stop by here. Awesome food. Locals made. if you know what I mean. So you know the favor is there. Aloha everybody"}
{"text":"Great food and great people. Everything was cooked well, my brother in law is from the Island of Hawaii and he approved."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to hurt the chain but this was my experience and I can't change it.   The place was definitely a mom and pop shop feel. The decor was very simple which I did like and the service was very friendly. It was a small place and there were only 5 table sets to sit.   I went with my mother and we ordered the Big Braddah Plate to share. I will admit It was on the cheap side and it was a good portion for us to share which is always good.Sadly, the wait was way to long for starters. We waited at least 20 minutes for our food, possibly more, and for a place with no people I think it was a tad bit long. When we got our food it was a good portion and they gave us two kalbi beefs instead of one.   Now for the food. The macaroni salad was pretty bland. It just tasted like mayonnaise. The Kalbi was super chewy and tough. I was having a lot of trouble trying to get it off the bone. The teri beef was thin and doused in sauce. The Katsu was the star though. It was cooked great and the breading was seasoned well.   Overall, it was okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this."}
{"text":"Brahhhhh!!! This place is winnah. My wife and I used to come here when it was Pineapple Express and the food was killah back then.  All I got to say is braddah Sammy and his wife are awesome. We stopped by when they were open but they closed early for the UH after party, Sammy came out and said we could still grab some stuff so he hooked it up on the prices even though the prices are great for the amount of food you get. All I can say is this place brings back the feels from back home with the taste of everything.  The pork hash is just like what we eat back home, the Manapua is char siu style like the ones at Libby's back home and are way better priced. And brahh the pastele!! Brah the size of it for $5 is bomb..   Ok pau gush on how good this place is, just go!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this place on Yelp, it looked a little iffy that it didn't exist. Back then it said \"Touch Of Aloha\". Then later name changed to \"House Of Aloha\" to me it didn't matter until Aunty over there told me the story and you know what \"House Of Aloha\" is mo bettah anyway. Reason being is the story behind it and what Aunty and Uncle had to go through to get to where they're at now.  It's a little hidden and you'll last it if you're not really looking for it but eh it's ok cuz it's still awesome. The location doesn't make the spot, it's the food and customer service that makes the spot.  As I walked up to the door there was a display board like a black board with different color letting showing the current days specials. Definitely brought back that plate lunch spot feeling to my stomach. And all of us from Hawaii know that feeling. And you can't get that from no LnL out here lol.  I walk in and was immediately greeted with that Aloha spirit. I guess we all just know if you from Hawaii the moke Hawaiian comes out lol   I ordered dozen pork hash, half dozen manapua, 6 pastele, and Large Chow Fun. 4 items that you can't get any where else.  I had to wait like 20 minutes for some fresh pork hash but braaaaahhhh, I'm glad I did. Aunty let me sample the one that was sitting for little while and this buggah was so good. Nice and meaty just like how pork hash supposed to taste. Then she says, wait till you try it fresh lol..well, she wasn't lying at all..these bad boys taste amazing fresh. The manapua bread is so damn soft. Like really really soft. Better than Libby and chun wah kam. It's not like cardboard or crumby. It holds perfect and it's the right ratio to char siu inside..I'm eating these as I'm making this review lol. Haven't tried the pastele yet because I bought it frozen so gotta take it home and steam it. But the pasteles are huuuuge lol. And uncle said one puerto rican made it sooooo you know it was made great and with TLC. The Chow fun taste exactly like how I remembered from back home.  Lemme tell you, you will not, I REPEAT YOU WILL NOT be disappointed. If you want some island food like how you remembered from Hawaii and wanna feel like you're in Hawaii again, head on over to \"HOUSE OF ALOHA\" and meet the family over there. You'll leave with a full stomach, smile on your face and new friends.."}
{"text":"Aloha Friday Hawaiian Plate Special was ono! lomi salmon was the bomb! Kalua pig was also ono! Go try it!!"}
{"text":"I went there a couple of weeks ago with a few friends for lunch, and it was fantastic! It took over for a less than great Filipino restaurant and I am so happy that they made it into something better! The service was great, the prices were reasonable, and the food was amazing! I already have plans to introduce more friends to it. It's in a convenient location and easy for a quick lunch to go or to sit and dine in. It has a family feel to it that makes you want to stay for hours!"}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday during lunch time and it was empty when we walked in. The owner was actually just leaving to make a delivery next door so we were left alone in the restaurant for a few minutes, which wasn't a problem for us since we were looking over the menu anyway.   We ordered a small chow fun, kalua pig and shoyu chicken plate, teri beef musubi, and pork hash. The owner let us know that he had just sold out of pork hash but he'd put on a new batch and it would take 20 minutes. We agreed because you always say yes to pork hash!   The \"small\" chow fun was more like a large, which I wasn't mad at. Extra is always a plus. It comes with chunks of spam and veggies. It was seasoned well and the noodles were cooked just right. The kalua pig had a smoky flavor and was juicy. The shoyu chicken had a touch of sweetness that balanced out the saltiness of the shoyu. Super yummy! The plate came with potato salad instead of Mac salad, for some reason. Wasn't a good potato salad, just tasted like the stuff you buy at Albertsons. The teri beef musubi wasn't the best. The beef was dry and lacked the teri sauce flavor. The pork hash was ok, could've used a little more seasoning and was a tad over cooked. Added a little shoyu and it tasted much better.   The food was a little touch and go but I'm chalking it up to the owner being the only one there to run everything. Speaking of the owner, he was super friendly and even recommended another place for us to check out for brunch. We'll have to come back again and try a few other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food in town. Haven't had anything bad yet. Noodles, hamburger steak, Teri burger, fries, katsu, all delicious. Owned and served by locals."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good!  Everything is made from scratch. The pork hash is the best.  Also, the chicken katsu is made fresh, not frozen like other places, and reminds me of what I ate growing up -- crispy golden panko crust."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for spam musubi and House of Aloha did not disappoint. I walked into an empty restaurant and Sammy, the owner, was chilling with his Dad. They opened this spot up after Dammy retired. Such a cool story of a local who was so passionate about food that they opened this local spot. I felt right at home.  Sammy was incredibly friendly and made a slight menu modification for me. He even laughed at my joke that I may be white but I have the heart and belly of a Hawaiian because they are both so happy all the time! #dadjokesfordays   I came for the spam musubi but I fell in love with the manapuas. I wasn't a fan of the macaroni salad, it was a bit bland and heavy-handed on the mayonnaise. Everything else was a big hit. The kalua pig has a really nice smoke to it and the chicken katsu was tender with a crispy exterior. Plenty of rice is served on the side.  I'm not over this way often, but when I am I'll be swinging in to say Aloha and to grab some grub. The menu isn't huge but there is so much more I want to try."}
