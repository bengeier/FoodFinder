{"text":"we live less than .5 Miles from this place so we order frequently and usually enjoy it.  tonight however delivery took more than an hour (again we live less than .5 Miles away) and when our pizza arrived it was cold and the chicken fingers are soggy. might be time to try a new place."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Everything I've tried is delicious, and the staff is so nice! The owner/chef is from Italy, and he is passionate about creating amazing food. If you dine in, you will truly see how fantastic this place is."}
{"text":"Russo's is in the same location that used to be Carmine's Pizza Kitchen. I ordered my usual pizza: Sausage, Bell Peppers and Onions. The service was quick and the pizza also came out quickly. The crust was a little bit thinner than Carmine's pizzas. The pizza was very good. I'll be going back for another. I have two complaints. The first is that the Iced Tea was not fresh. The other complaint is that the internet on my I phone did not work inside the restaurant despite showing 3 of 4 bars. It almost seems like the internet is purposely blocked inside. However, if you walk outside it works fine. The waitress tried to give me the password, however it must have been changed. She was not sure if it had been changed since it was Carmine's."}
{"text":"Great friendly little pizza place. I love the chopped salad.  Service is friendly and very quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Russo's.  Tried the pizza many times and it was very good for Vegas.   I tried the wings and they were cooked to perfection.  Recommend this pizzeria."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The new owner is 10x nicer than the previous owner of Carmine's and the food is absolutely fabulous.  Here are some of my favorites: Caesar salad and chopped salad are phenomenal.  The lasagna is great and their pizza is to die for.  I'm in love with their crust.  I have a 2 year old and they treat her so well and they are extremely accommodating.  This is a tremendous family-owned business and I love being able to go out and support the smaller guy, especially when the experience is so wonderful.  I highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"I've had terrific Pizza in New York & Los Angeles and this Pizza is the Bessssst. ...also, that creamy Home Made Italian Salad Dressing is \"to die for\".....Tony knows his culinary craft !!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for really good homemade Italian, this place is for you. The pizza is delicious. You can taste the difference right away--not your typical chain restaurant cheap cheese and sugary sauce. The owner, Tony, makes his signature penne pasta with an incredible vodka sauce--my personal favorite. I was surprised to find out everything is made fresh when you order. Nice friendly atmosphere and great service. Nicole, the server, is so nice. We love this neighborhood pizza kitchen!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while on vacation and was extremely impressed. It was a small neighborhood pizza establishment that was very well decorated and clean. The staff was busy but  notified us they would be with us asap and everyone was very friendly. We ordered the dinner salad, which was excellent and their house dressing was delicious! For pizza we got a large vegetarian, also delicious and was authentic Sicilian style. The crust was cooked perfectly! Would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"GREAT food and amazing pizza. Great atmosphere and amazing service. Make sure you call ahead if you want garlic knots because it takes a bit to make them. Overall  OFF THE HOOK, best new york pizza in henderson. Props to the owner because he works his tail off back in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Pizza is always great... Try the Russo Special.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Kids enjoy the chicken Parmesan, pasta & meatballs.  Great atmosphere with individual TV's at each table..."}
{"text":"The chopped salad is the best in Las Vegas. I enjoy the spaghetti with meatballs and the very thin crust pizza. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we are in Vegas. We've had their pizza, salad, pepperoni roll, and chicken parmigiana. We've never been disappointed. Their house bread is soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Good tasting pizza! Prices are decent, delivery was fast. Would definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Pizza and wings. Pizza was awesome but we were so disappointed with the wings. They were tiny bird wings which was way overcooked and dry. Tasted like rubber. 2 stars for the wings."}
{"text":"I went to Russo's one night to eat with my mom, and we had Rigatoni alla Russo. BEST pasta I've ever had !! I highly recommend it !!!! Great food great service such a great family environment! Love it !! GO THERE AND ENJOY. Most def deserves 5 stars more than that !! Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"12\" one item pizza was $14+. The NYC style pizza wasn't bad but far from great. Definitely not worth the midtown Manhattan prices. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great salads! The antipasto is my favorite, delicious every time. In fact I'm going to pick up one right now! That and the pepperoni roll, Mmmmm:)"}
{"text":"If you like the cook's hair baked into your stroboli then this is your place to come. We came here to be away from the strip. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME here. Service was horrible. Came in at 8:15 pm (they close at 9:00 pm) and the girl was not welcoming at all maybe cuz it was late. Pizza was good but pricey. My husband had a grey hair baked into his stromboli and when I told the young waitress girl she just said \"oh ok\" and took the plate with the piece that had the hair and continued her conversation with her friends. She ignored us the rest of the night. Wow!!! Will not go there again. I maybe would have added another store if there was an apology."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town with the freshest authentic ingredients....family run and the TV's at each table during sporting events doesn't hurt !"}
{"text":"We love Russo's! Truly one of the best pizza's in town! Have been coming here ever since since they have been in business! No one beats their prices and amazing taste. Russo's special pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people.   The cheese steak is different and one of the best that I ever had.   One of my son's favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. The food was delicious and the service second to none. Everyone needs to come here and meet the owner Tony and his kids, Nicole Kristina and Joey, that work here. The pizza is great and the linguini with clams the best in the world. They made us feel home right away."}
{"text":"The new owners have taken care to serve the same great-tasting, high-quality food that Tony Russo was known for.  In fact, key employees from before are still here.  The server Yvonne is the owners' daughter and she is attentive and pleasant.  This is a family business worthy of your support.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family has lived in the same house around the corner from this place for over 20 years. We've seen all kinds of places come and go from this area, but Russo's is a staple with us. They're fantastic. They're the best pizza I've honestly ever had. About once a month, we splurge and order take away from them and it's always fantastic. The owner knows exactly who I am and is so nice. Every time we've done a sit down dinner or lunch there, the service is fantastic. Overall, it's an amazing little place. I'd pick them for a meal over any other place in town."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizzas I have had in Las Vegas  Went here one night for dinner with a guy who said the place was hands down the best in town and a few other people. As a group, we ordered two pizzas, a stromboli and a variety of salads to try. I only tried the Caesar Salad which was very good and I am picky about those. The pizza was delivered to the table and super hot. It was amazing. The bottom was nice and crunchy and the cheese and pepperoni were perfectly cooked. It was delicious. Very very close to best pizza in town.  My friend also commented that the owner, also the one whom makes the food also makes his own sauce. It is delicious. He got an extra star for that! Definitely will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  First time, I tried the pasta and it was just ok, not great or remarkable.  This time, we ordered a large sausage pizza.  The pizza is ok, but nothing exceptional.  Sauce is ok, sausage was ok, the cheese I could barely taste and the crust I found to be chewy.  I've had better pizza elsewhere. I really wanted to like this little place as it is clean and friendly but just not sold on flavor for anything that I've tried so far and the server appears to be the daughter of the owner and she is running around to help everyone, but seems that they need another full time server as we never did receive a drink refill. I wouldn't say the food was bad, just more bland."}
{"text":"They have an awesome stuffed pizza here  A little overpriced almost 30bucks for it  But maybe that's the reason why it's delicious haha  Nothing bad to say about this place  Looks nice and friendly inside to dine in too  Friendly staff  The chef or pizza maker is the owner itself has a couple of employees but most of the time its him himself making the pizzas  Great place A++"}
{"text":"I loved it when it was Carmine's Pizza Kitchen, the new owner Tony that changed it to Russo's Pizza is a great guy, he's improved and takes a lot of pride in the service and getting to know the neighborhood customers unlike the Carmine's staff. The pizzas not the same, Tony doesn't use my favorite brand of cheese grande like Carmine used, the sauce is good, just different also compared to Carmine (i know the tomato brands are different also i wont reveal anymore secrets lol), the crust isnt as doughy and chewy as Carmine, since Tony took over he must have a pride in his own recipes, I dont blame him, I wish him luck, he has great fettucine alfredo and other items. Its worth a try it may be more for others!"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the corner thanks for the great,customer service pizza was good price not to bad but oneproblem  there is always kids just hanging around there"}
{"text":"Best Pizza i have ever had. Service was great. Hands down best pizza in Vegas . This guy knows what hes doing . You know its special when u walk in an their is older italian people there who are treated like family . You must try this place NOW!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place four stars but in the end I just couldn't do it. We went here monday night and got the carry-out special 18\" cheese pizza for $10.99. We added pepperoni to if for $1.75 I think it was. We also ordered the chopped salad.  The pizza was good. We used to go to Broadway on Sahara and Centennial until they bugged out. I would say both places are comparable as far a quality, but the pizza a Russo's was missing that slight herbal overtone that Broadway had. Also, they really wusseed out on the pep. I know I'm getting a good deal on the pie on a monday night, but you are the ones after all offering the deal so you should serve up the exact same pizza on a monday as you do on a friday. That said the pizza was a solid four stars.  Where they lost the fourth star was on the chopped salad. The quality of the salad was great. The creamy balsamic dressing was wonderful. But at $10 for the salad, they really could have thrown some more greens in."}
{"text":"After passing by this little gem a dozen times, my husband and I finally decided to take the plunge and try it.  We ordered a cheese pizza, the antipasto salad, and zeppolis.  The food was yummy (My husband who is from New York even gave the food a big thumbs up).  The restaurant was clean. The staff was super friendly (you could tell it was a family-run business).  There were TVs at every table which helped keep my 4 year old and 2 year old boys occupied while my husband and I chowed down!  The only complaint I had was that there was only one high chair.  It wasn't a great big fancy place, but we had a great dining experience.  I really couldn't have asked for more.  We will definitely come again and try the other goodies on the menu."}
{"text":"We're always testing out pizzeria's in town and Russo's is one of the best. The whole family prefers Russo's. It's the combination of the right sauce, crust and cheese and the family friendly environment that makes us go back."}
{"text":"This is not the same place is was before. Tony Russo left the restaurant and the food is now subpar. The new owners know little to nothing about making Italian food. The pizza is bland and under cooked and the salad dressing is acidic. Don't be fooled into thinking this place is the same as before - it's not!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Ordered the Sicilian pizza not knowing what it really was. The crust was super crunchy I was hoping for doughy. Place is really nice inside and the service was good.  Huge portions. I don't think ill return just wasn't for me. But is worth a try"}
{"text":"We've tried many different pizza places.  My husband is very particular.  One day we tried Russo's on Rainbow and Tropicana, as it is close to his doctor's office.  So after tweaking the pepperoni and mushroom pizza with added pepperoni n mushrooms, he decided this was his very favorite.  Now he orders this pizza two or three times a month."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on 8/28/16 and it was our first time going there. The pizza was the best I've had in Vegas. We also got a meatball sub and it was perfect. Both the pizza and sub didn't have a lot of sauce. Which was good. The crust was crunchy on the bottom, just how I like it. The service was excellent. Very friendly, the cook and the lady that served us. The cook said sorry for the wait,but I don't feel like we waited to long. The potato salad was the best."}
{"text":"Ordered the large plain pie special and would highly recommend it. The thin dough holds a nice ratio of cheese to sauce, while the crust is crispy and tasty...very much like a large NY style slice. One large 18\" pie will EASILY feed 4 hungry full grown individuals. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other items."}
{"text":"Closest pizza place to the new house - please please please be my go-to pizza joint.  went with the two slice and soda lunch special - $5 ( if cheese only ; 50 cent /slice add on for toppings )   Also ordered spaghetti and meatballs for dinner later.($12)  The pizza was decent - crunchy exterior, yet light/pillowy inside.  sauce had decent seasoning.  toppings were average ( peperoni and sausage )   The spaghetti and meatballs.  I thought the meatballs were alright but the sauce - sub par - had a strong vinegar taste and watery - I can't stand it when the sauce is added to water logged pasta - a problem I encounter at a lot of mom/pop places.  a simple test to see if this occurs to you - when you get the plate/bowl of pasta, use either the fork or a piece of bread to support the pasta and tilt the plate/bowl slightly to one side - if you see watery sauce dripping or worse, streaming through, the cook did a poor job draining the pasta - the best option for a cook ( if available ) is putting the pasta and sauce in a sauté pan to cook out any excess water, then serve.  If I visit in the future - pizza only   pic attached"}
{"text":"Great service. Love the clams and pizza. family friendly. We love all the food. People are very friendly. Kids love the Tv's"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best pizza places in Las Vegas. Hidden gem, OG Italian owner, a New York slice of pizza. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I was actually excited to try out this place because of the decent reviews, and as I just walked in (8pm) I got greeted with a very rude \"dining in or taking out?\" and after asking if we can sit outside I got another very rude \"okayy but I wont be serving you outside\" um okay? I didnt ask for you to wine and dine me. I came to get a slice of pizza and sit outside on your patio area, its not that difficult. Obviously the staff needs to get a little lesson on customer service. I waited to get the pizza to rate this place. Sub-par. Tasted like a slice of cardboard. I really would not reccomend this spot to any of our vegas locals. But then again, maybe u get a different server and better luck with their sucky service :) I wish we would have just went to meraki (greek spot) next door. Their customer service is always an A+. Even the Little Ceasers down the street has better tasting pizzas than this crap!! Btw: Site says they close at 9pm it is now 8:30pm and they are locking their doors and closing their blinds. Wow! This place is a joke!  Best,  Dajana :)"}
{"text":"Another fabulous dinner at Russo's !!! Went in thinking pasta ANYTHING but changed my mind when I saw people at the next table eating Sicilian pizza !! It looked amazing so I had to order it ... and I was NOT disappointed !!! It was seriously the best Sicilian I've had in many many years !! Thank you Tony ... for keeping your product real."}
{"text":"I took my son, daughter& mom for a pizza today for my sons birthday; the pizza was so good! The ingredients were fresh, and the crust was perfect! I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim last night. We just wanted to go to a place where we could sit down and enjoy a good meal. This turned out to be that place.  We started with the pasta fagoli. It was excellent. The taste perfect. A spot on taste of how it is meant to be.  I had the chicken parminga with a side of spaghetti. I was so impressed with the sauce. I am a snob when it comes to Marina sauce. This is delicious. As good as mother made. The chicken was good I liked the flavor I just wish it was a Little thinner cutlet. That is just my preference.  DH had the linguine with clams. Two dozen clams adorned the linguine. It was a huge portion cooked just right.  Then the bread, perfectly crunchy, crusty Italian bread. Real butter.  No room for dessert. Took home leftovers.  The place is spotless. The owner very welcoming. The server was wonderful and attentive.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! I'm from NY and Russo's is the closest to home pizza here in Vegas. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday they only charge $10.99 for a large cheese pie, awesome deal IMO! I have gotten food here many times and it's always great!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza and wings for delivery last night. The pizza sauce tastes like bland tomato sauce from a can! It was so gross I couldn't eat more than a couple bites and I forced those down. I got sick because of how gross it was. My husband wouldn't even eat it and I have never known him to not only waste food but waste PIZZA! The wings... The flavor was merely okay! But they were tough! We threw almost all of it away! I have never had such BAD food in my life. I called back and politely informed the girl that it was so bad it made me sick and she apologized and said her manager would call me when he comes back in 2 days. I just received a call from him and he was immediately defensive. He called ONLY to inform me that the pizza couldn't have possibly made me sick! That I must have a virus! I told him NO... I am fine! The pizza was so disgusting I threw it up! And YES that CAN happen! Does he think he's a Doctor? He was completely unprofessional! I almost would've preferred he never called me back then call me back just to argue and be a cry baby about his pizza being disgusting! What a child! I will forever warn people now about not only the crappy food here but the rude and unprofessional manager!"}
{"text":"Such good Italian.  Close to my house and I think it's a family that runs it.  Such a sweet cozy place.  Small, and they have a ton of take out business so getting a table at off times is no big deal but I assume they are packed for lunch and dinner rush.  Great service and great food in with a \"little Italy\" vibe.  Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Thought i would give them a try as they have so many great reviews,, im not sure why? Unless i just had a bad experience with them. I orered 2 pizzas and some chicken, the girl who answered the phone was very fast and quite rude, didnt even reapet my order back to me, so i was concerned to start with, after 45 minutes still no food, i phoned them again to confirm my order, they still had no time for me, even if they were busy there is no excuse, was bluntly  told that all deliveries had left, then they hung up the phone. 1 hour and 23 minutes after my order the food arrived, the driver was friendly. But unforuntatly the pizza was cold, maybe thats why it didnt taste very nice, just a bad experience.."}
{"text":"Me and my son love this place staff so nice the pizza omg it was delicious and perfect size."}
{"text":"Like a huge NY slice? THIS IS YOUR PLACE!  Hubby and I had a super craving of cheese pizza and I demanded to try a new place :)  This place is super small and we managed to grab the last table to dine in.  Prompt we received menus and the young lady took our drink order. This place is family owned. Two daughters are the wait staff and their father and some other gentlemen are manning the kitchen. We ordered two glasses of red wine and two waters. We ordered a greek salad, garlic bread and a large cheese pizza.  Very soon we had our salad. It had cubed fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepperoncini, fresh cut cubed feta cheese, kalamata olives, and oil and vinegar. The dressing had a kick to it. Almost a spicy...but not. I still can not figure out what it was but WOW it was good. Shortly after our bread came and I'm totally not a bread person and I tried it and it was soooooooo good! Crispy but not too hard with lots of garlic butter with no garlic chunks.  I was looking around and noticed the owner rolling the dough and tossing it a little. Sooo awesome! Fresh and super fresh.  So perfect timing later here comes our pizza WWOWWOWWWWWW! See the pictures that I took. Wow what a beauty! Finally someplace that makes a almost perfect NY slice. Huge pieces. Perfect flavor. Be careful when you shake the pepper flakes. I love them and usually pile them on. For some reason theirs are SUPER hot lol! My mouth swelled up a little because I piled on the normal amount of pepper that I usually eat. Still yummmmy!   I just really can not wait to discover some of their pasta dishes like the Linguine with Tomato and Basil.   I can't wait to go back! Tooooo bad they are not open later than they are. 9pm seems early to me but that's ok :) Looks like on their website http://www.russospizzakitchenlasvegas.com/ they are listing different specials. Yum yummy."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. I'm from NYC and we are very picky when it comes to pizza. This pizza is really incredible. I have taken probably half a dozen friends here and everyone raves about it. Its family owned an operated which is a rarity in Vegas. Tony the owner is a stand up guy.  P.S. Get the pizza well done the crust gets crunchy and amazing."}
{"text":"When I know we are getting pizza from Russo's I always know to put on my stretch pants because I don't just eat one slice! I am accustomed to eating pizza from the east coast and this is the closest I can find to meet my needs. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, the food is amazing never ordered the anything I didn't like, the family that owns the place treats you as if you are their family, so welcoming and pleasant. I come here all the time with my family service is always fast and food is great HIGHLY recommend this place to all!!!  Real Italian food with a smile to go with it !"}
{"text":"This is the closest my husband and I have come to NYC pizza in Vegas. The crust was thin enough, but next time we may as them to make it \"well done\"...we like it crispier.   Great tasting sauce. Good amount of cheese and toppings.  The only thing is that, I prefer loose sausage pieces over the sliceable sausage meat.  Seems like a family owned place. The staff was very nice.  The decor is tasteful...way more inviting than other pizza joints. I like that each table has its own TV.   They don't serve alcohol.  Coming back for sure..."}
{"text":"Love Russo's. Can't go wrong. Very nice people, great service. The food is really good from the pizza to pasta, salads and sandwiches. They always make me feel welcome for my business. It's most def one of my favorite spots since I move here to Vegas."}
{"text":"I Love Russo's! They have very delicious food. Their Pizza is the best in town!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Italian Restaraunts, probably too many here in Vegas. But this is definitely a jewel that sticks out. Pizza is Pizza and it's good but what really sticks out are the non pizza items. I really liked the chopped Salad. We also had those clam shells and the difference is in the soup part. I didn't want to waste the rest after eating all the clams so I just used some bread,soaked it in and ate it. The chicken fingers were perfect, not too bready. I'll tell you what sticks out and you would think an Italian Kitchen doesn't have it. But their cheesecake is absolute bomb. It was the perfect texture. Even shared it with a couple from New Jersey and they even said its just as good if not better than Junior's in NY or Carnegie..  Check it out, and yes you can scrape the cheesecake off the plastic wrap and not feel guilty"}
{"text":"Just okay for pizza and salads- cheese slice is $2.50, crust is perfectly thin and crispy but sauce was on the bland side. The Greek salad has scant non-lettuce ingredients and no protein for $10 but an incredible dressing- it's called a house italian, but it's a creamy version that tastes like a really good Caesar.   Another table got a $16 steamed mussels special that looked to be a small portion, but the great garlic fragrance was enough to make me rethink my selections. Overall I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  The space is small, walk-up style but dining in is nicer than you'd think- there's also a large TV tuned to sports above the counter and individual flat screen TVs at some of the booths."}
{"text":"My daughter introduced me to her favorite pizza place last night.  Many thanks!  We ordered by phone and it was ready for pickup when promised.  The toppings were exactly as we requested and the folks there were cheerful and friendly.  When we got it home and dug in, it was everything she told me it would be.  Very fresh and tasty and NOT smothered in garlic.  Some places seem to think it's ok to let garlic overpower all the other ingredients, but not Russo's.  Thanks for the great pizza!  I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Las Vegas! Reminds me of being home on the east coast. Pizza is perfect. The salads are equally as amazing (Greek salad is the best!) Parm sandwich was perfect. I haven't tried anything there that didn't taste good. Mmm. I want Russos tonight now!"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA and STROMBOLI!  the large pizza is HUGE.  that's about all i have ever tried here and i go back a couple times a month.  one of the best, if not the best pizza  i have had in las vegas...."}
{"text":"Great tasty food Good prices Clean place They deliver !!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice -- once in the restaurant, and once ordered delivery.  Walked in for lunch with a friend... very homely feeling.  We decided to share the calamari and lasagna.   The calamari was excellent; not heavily-breaded, light and not too salty!  The lasagna was very cheesy and perfectly cooked and was a great portion.  If I could cook lasagna at home, it's how I would want mine to taste.  I really liked the atmosphere and there are little TVs at each table... good for those solo-lunchers who might want to catch the local news or catch up on sports scores during their lunch break.  You can also order pizza by the slice, which is super convenient for quick lunch pickups.   The second time I ordered for delivery, we had the calamari and a small pepperoni mushroom pizza.  Again the calamari was on point, and the pizza was what I expected... wonderfully cheesy and flavorful.  I really love to support family businesses, and this one did not disappoint!  Feels like Italian home cooking, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Pizza is huge!! 2 slices is more then enough!! Highly suggest the cheesy garlic bread. They have a great lunch deal 2 HUGE slices and drink $5 enough for 2 honestly!! Sooo good! More like NY style pizza but more flavor"}
{"text":"Great food. Pizza is delicious. The restaurant inside is very nice and clean. Each table has it's own small screen tv and the kids love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night and ordered a large pepperoni pizza, a traditional calzone, and a bucket of wings to go. The atmosphere was nice, I would definitely come and eat here in the future, the service was great! They were quite busy and the girl gave me a free drink while I waited which was very nice! About 15 minute wait which wasn't bad for all the stuff I ordered and for how busy they were.   The pizza was awesome, one of the best I've had in a long while, great crust! The calzone was quite tasty too but I wasn't crazy for the ham, I would get pepperoni next time. The wings were nice and crisp and I would have given this place 5 stars if they hadn't forgotten my side of hot sauce! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We will not be ordering from here again... pizza was so greasy and soggy.  Thought we would give it a try, there is a Yelp 10% Cash Back and a Groupon 30% back offer, but no where did it state you had to eat there to get the offer... so we ended up not receiving the Cash Back.  We ordered 2 18' pizzas (Pepperoni and Russo's Special) and a bucket of wings... total with tip was $76.95... definitely NOT worth it!  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pizza was horrible which I can understand happens with delivery, however when we called to tell them that our pizza came with the topping off the manager Tony said he didn't care and he was to busy to deal with this.  Hung up on me twice.  That's the worse customer service.  He said he wasn't afraid of being blasted on social media.   I will never go there again because of  Tony"}
{"text":"I have gone here several times.  My favorite is their pasta.  Tastes fresh and delicious.  Pasta with clams is my favorite but I just tried their penne pasta and it was delish.  The pizza's are great too....tonight we had Russo's special.  The ingredients were fresh and the dough was wonderful.  My husband is hard to please and he felt that their pizza did not taste 'commercial' but fresh."}
{"text":"I came to Russo looking for some carb loading pasta dish night before long bike ride/run training day. I always wanted check out Russo since close to the house. Each time I make Presto Cafe run next door just reminder need check it out. I cam on Saturday night. I was surprise see the place jammed packed. The most part it seems like the place never fills out. On this night lucked out because scored the only table that was available. They do takeout so if worst came to worst could have done it. Thankfully I was able too enjoy my pasta fresh hot from kitchen straight to my table.   I settled on \"Our Signature Penne Pasta\". I thought was pretty good. The Pink Vodka Sauce. Basically tomato cream sauce had nice balance between the two. Still had hint of Vodka. The italian sausage, peas, and onion was the perfect compliment. Peas tomato and cream beautiful thing by itself. The penne pasta was cooked spot on al dente. The portion size is no joke. It came in nice size bowl might not be deep bowl but nice and wide round dish filled with pasta. Thankfully was looking too carb load so could finish it all. All the pastas (I notice other customers portions) you could eat half now and rest later or leftovers. The price is really reasonable not saying cheap but not high end price would pay on the strip price. The bread that comes with your meal not bad. I wish the butter would have been softer.   The whole menu most part is your standard italian dishes. They also offer catering options. Deliveries.  The service was good. I know the only had one server and the place was packed. I just went up to the counter ordered then sat down. The only thing with service went to refill my own drink. It was busy but found it interesting other tables waitress was refilling their drinks.   I atmosphere like that old school italian small family run business. The owner is very much on it from taking orderers, greeting people come in and out, and even helping bussing tables since busy had other customers waiting. Russo bringing food out in the restaurant. The whole table cloth the red and white checker board style. All the italian artwork mostly of food. If that not interesting can always check out sports on television. The table along the wall each one has it own television. I notice remote on each one. Not sure if allowed change them or not.   No doubt looking for carb loading pre race or workout. Russo is great spot and one that sure will hit up again in the future..."}
{"text":"wow! this is pretty good nyc pizza. those who know what im talking about will know the knowz. those that dont knowz wont knowz the knowz.   after eating at elements me and my sister said that the pizza's would be our dessert.  i got a slice of pepperoni and she got a slice of cheese. it was excellent. crispy crust, slightly salty sauce and cheese, and slightly chewy dough under the sauce and cheese. it wasnt even oily, although i like a little oil.  keep in mind this was a slice and it tasted great. im sure it'd be way better if it was fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good chicken wings. The place is a nice size for dine in. Kinda pricey but nothing extreme. The pizza is worth it.. even when they deliver it's always fresh! Chicken wings taste good with the right amount of sauce. Grade A on those.. good job you guys!"}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday  ..  no regrets. Great food and service.  Lots of specials and options, portions can be shared .. Kids won't waste food."}
{"text":"ive only had the italian cheese steak, an thats enough to get 5 stars out of me."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza all around. I ordered one plain cheese, one pepperoni, and one mushroom/sausage. The sauce was good and the dough/crust was cooked very nicely. They delivered very quickly. Not the best pizza in town, but by no means the worst. I would definitely recommend to try if looking for a good pizza place to be delivered."}
{"text":"This is the second time getting the white pizza and it is delicious!! My husband tried the one with basil and tomatoes and he enjoyed every bite as well! Cheesecake and the small filled calzones were delicious:) Very good place!"}
{"text":"Tried yesterday-EXCELLENT!!! (and like right out my back door!) Staff too friendly, very accomodating. FINALLY found a REAL Italian sandwich! Pizza very good-light 'touch\" with the sauce-i appreciate this, zeppolis-YUMMY! Take it from an Italian and a Sicilian-\"must go\"place for good Italian! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So it's been a really long time since I had pizza, and today is cheat day so I had to go all out. I heard great things about Russo's from my peers and let me tell you... they were right. This is REAL mf pizza. it reminds me of pizza back home in New York. Each slice is thin. Not too soggy and not too crispy. The taste is a journey and will be surprising even to the pizza enthusiast who thinks all pizza tastes the same. I recommend the sausage and garlic, but you will never go wrong with plain cheese."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the simplicity of this place, food is great, right price, & reminds me of a favorite pizza place back home in Maryland... Have been here twice in last 2 weeks and will continue to come back & keep trying all the dishes. Had the chopped salad today and it was perfect... Wouldn't change a thing... Check out this place, so happy right down street from my house & they give me the remote for my tables tv, seriously can it get any better??? Thanks keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"First time here but I will definitely be back! A homey pizza joint where the owner is working in the kitchen and greeting everyone who comes through the door!  There are TVs at each table and the restaurant is nice, clean and cozy. Staff is kind and drinks and meals are served quickly and hot!  This is top 10 pizza places for me! Slices of each pizza are enormous and priced perfectly! Basic cheese pizza is about $2.50 and each additional topping is 0.50, not bad compared to other restaurants where they charge you $3.00 for pepperoni!"}
{"text":"Had the white pizza, cheese pizza, and wings. The tomato sauce is amazing and ties all their pies together. The chicken wings are crispy and on point. With the friendly waiting staff this place is awesome and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the tomato basil pizza tonight. What a disappointment. The pizza wasn't fully cooked, barely any sauce, and the tomatoes were cold with no flavor. The mozzarella sticks were good. Won't be ordering from here again. The delivery guy was nice but didn't give us any parmesan cheese or crushed peppers."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 5 or 6 times in the last month and a half. It is the best neighborhood Italian place I have found outside of NY. Everything we have ordered their from the chicken Parmigiana to the Marsala to the Pizza and the Penne in vodka with sausage and peas is perfect and homemade. the Meatball and chicken subs are great. Menu is somewhat limited and they don't do veal, but who cares. I cant wait for next week."}
{"text":"Gave them a 1 only because it looked like a nice place to eat. A woman abruptly asked us if we were picking up and we said no. It was 10 minutes before closing. She said \"we're closed\" and asked us to leave.  It's too bad because there are hundreds of mini-mall pizza places. We were hoping to find a good one in our neighborhood. If she is the owner, she should read some of these comments. Looks like we aren't the only ones that think their customer service skills are lacking."}
{"text":"I really can't say much about the menu selections because we only ever get the pizza but the pizza is awesome and so much better than those big, impersonal chain places. This place is right around the corner, the people are always friendly and accommodating to us and I'll never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I like their pizza and wider menu too.  Eat in or take out.  Solid value & nice staff."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave negative stars.  This place used to be hands down the absolute best pizza and Italian food in Las Vegas. Since the fall of 2017, the food, service, and atmosphere has gone down hill.  On 3 seperate occassions I have ordered pizza to be given a BURNED pizza. Not crispy...burned...black.  it was completely inedible. I tried one last time today and ordered a calzone...I wanted the soft cheese from the inside as I just had oral surgery. It was delivered to my home, I immediately cut it open,  and it was not only basically empty,  but actually COLD inside. I live 2 minutes from this place,  nothing should every be cold when it gets here. I called to complain, and the manager actually argued with me about whether or not the food was cold! I demanded my money be refunded, and told him he could have the driver pick it back up. He said no, keep it. Thankfully agreed to return my money, but the only place that calzone is going is into the garbage. This owner took a thriving friendly neighborhood business and destroyed it. What is worse, is they use crap ingredients,  serve a crap product, and still charge a premium price, and use the name of the former owner.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the service, menu and the food! Reasturant is beautiful, cozy and family operated. If you want Italian and want to go somewhere off the strip, you will not be disappointed. Prices are great as well!"}
{"text":"Cute little pizza joint with nice tvs at the tables against the wall. We ordered the garlic bread and asked for moz cheese on top. Came with marinara sauce. It was very good. We ordered the 12\" Russo's Special and that was good as well. Next time I want to try one with tomato, basil and garlic. They were busy (Friday night) but it was worth the wait imo. U can tell they're trying hard to accommodate everyone in a tight place. I'm sure we'll be back. We also want to try the Alfredo and the lasagna some time."}
{"text":"First try was a great Pie!  The bottom was still crispy had a great taste to it.  Everyone in our office likes we will go back for more!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Talk about inflation on the food and drinks. I had gone to this place years ago when it had a different name, so I expect something different. Nope same owner different name same rip off prices. The pizza is all soggy and no taste to it, I really hate to leave bad reviews but I had to do it. 60 dollars for a family of 6 with just a plain cheese at 3.00 a drink and wings plus tip included in that. The pizza was just terrible for the price, I could of gone to metro and got 2 good pizzas for the same price and with beer not watered down fountain drinks. So I was upset about that, but then the owners entire family and I mean daughter cousins sisters husbands kids come in and hang out. So I notice this is where the inflation comes from, because when you pay to eat you pay for his entire blood line to eat for free. Not including handouts he passes from the cash register to his family members as you can tell is was not for the business profit. So this explains it all, on the note I feel bad for the owner which is probably the pizza guy who looks overworked. Never again will I ever take my family again, got home with heartburn that's how you know the pizza is no good. Go on your own terms"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Italian restaurants I've come to in Vegas in a very long time. From the moment we came in, our waitress (Ivonne) has a smile on her face and was 100% accommodating, such a sweet gal. It was our first time here and she answered every single question we had without hesitation. We ordered a variation of menu items from a Sicilian pizza to chicken Parmesan to wings and we were informed that the garlic knots were free of charge if you were dining in. They were amazing knots, some of the best I've ever had,... smothered in garlic, spices and olive oil. I can't believe I've driven by this place so many times and never stopped in. I am very intrigued and excited to stop back in here some time soon and maybe even try their $5 lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Just checked my review and my ADHD got the best of me.  Last line should read fresser.  Also, I started to warn you that unless you want Tony in your face, Do Not bring up Obama or Hillary!!  He is a funny guy.  I remember last year he was complaining about his costs going up 300 percent!  I said Tony, we don't in Weimar Germany.  He said in a heavy Sicilian accent \". My boxes goa up 30percent, my cheese goa up 25 percent....\". You get the idea but I didn,t want to explain to him that it's additive.  But great food.  Don't forget to try the meatballs and cannoli"}
{"text":"Great Italian fresh made pizza! My husband and my father in law are Italians and very picky about food, they also agreed that Russo's pizza it's a real deal"}
{"text":"I'm veeery picky about my pizza. I grew up in a town with amazing pizza places on every corner and it is very hard to find here in Las Vegas. Russo's Pizza gets very close to my comfort food. The sauce is just the right amount, the crust is soft and chewy, and the toppings were loaded with flavor. The slices were GIGANTIC; the picture really doesn't do it justice. One slice was easily the equivalent to two slices. Will order again!"}
{"text":"Huge servings, even in delivery. Very tasty, prompt delivery. Very nice. Great attention to detail. Highly recommend. Comes with bread for pasta dishes."}
{"text":"No alcohol. New owner. Pizza was OK. Mostly empty on  Friday night.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped there a few weeks ago an tried the pizza, it was good so I thought maybe give them a try on the sandwiches.  I seen the open sign was turned on.  There was one person sitting in the dining room.   I walk up to the counter. The person making pizza asked me if he could help me.  I requested a meatball parm sandwich.   He gives me a look an says we don't open until 11:00.  I look at my phone an it's 10:56am.   Boy horrible customer service.   I don't think I will spend any money there anymore."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.   Thin crust, light sauce, hot hot hot, delicious, pizza. This was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. We started with an antipasto salad. It was piled high with meat and cheese and it was served on mixed greens. Tossed lightly with a vinagrette. We ordered two pizzas. One vegetarian and one stuffed pizza. We also shared a plate of cheese raviolis with alfredo sauce. The stuffed pizza was great too. Much different than pizzas I have had in the past. But the thin crust vegetarian was better. Much better. And the ravioli? Excellent. You can tell that all the ingredients are quality and fresh. The alfredo sauce had little pieces of garlic in it and it was full of flavor.   This place is family owned and I am very happy supporting the local community.   We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This Place is right around the corner from me, its really good, I know people don't like anchovies.. but I do... they had them, the owner hooked me up and the quality of the pizza is great. I support small business and they are a great little Mom&Pop place.."}
{"text":"My review is only for the pizza since I haven't tried anything else yet. If you love crispy crunchy pizza, then you will love this place. They have individual slices for a pretty good deal. Although not huge slices like some pizza parlors, their pizza is just really good. The staff is super friendly. They have individual mini tv's on the tables and lots of specials."}
{"text":"Had white pizza and chicken fingers. Family enjoyed meal. Cute, cozy, clean little restaurant. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times & it's pretty good. I've come here during lunch since they have a lunch specials  Pizza Slices are large, prices are reasonable, but service is okay. I had to ask & remind my server a couple times about my drink refill =\  The place is a little small, so it can get packed during peak hours."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Nice family owned restaurant that truly feels like home. Super attentive and thoughtful. We mentioned how one of us was lactose intolerant, and they remembered this throughout the entire dining experience. Brought oil and herbs for her, as opposed to butter. Also offered to make a portion of the pizza without any cheese on it and we loved it! Most places forget and add their normal share of dairy but they were careful and continuously checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Will def return!"}
{"text":"Awesome local pizza joint. Tony has way more than pizzas lemme tell you! His antipasto salad is fantastic. Service is great I think it's his daughter, she's great, all the girls are great.   Looking for a great authentic pizza and chicken parm kinda night, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Love their calamari! Light and crispy. Pizza is good too.   I went back and had their spaghetti and meatballs and their sauce is amazing! Made fresh daily."}
{"text":"Solid cheese \"pie\".  Good gravy.  If you understand this....then you know where I'm coming from.   They even sent me the wrong pizza by accident (it happens) and they called me right as the guy left.   Girl said. \"Keep the pizza and we'll send you the right one\".   Good stuff.  Try them out."}
{"text":"Great food and service !!! This is our new favorite place ..my family love this little cute place . Thanks to the new owners they are really nice ."}
{"text":"This place is basically what I imagine when I think of a neighborhood Italian pizza kitchen in the USA. I've never actually dined here so can't comment on the service, but have gotten takeout numerous times and it's my go-to pizzeria in the area. The owner is really friendly and is always throwing in some extra food especially when I do a larger order for my office.  The big positives on the pizza are the crust and the sauce. I'm also a fan of the strombolis and pasta fagioli."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick slice and loved it! Went back to try out the rest of the menu but was disappointed by the rude service. The waitress gave us an empty and rushed hello while continuing to talk to her current table. We pulled a chair for a table and decided to move because the baby wouldn't fit (newborn in her carrier) No one told us where to sit and we were trying to give this place a shot.   The chef kept telling the waitress to fix the table we moved from. We thought this was rude as we were right there. We felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave. Won't be coming back here. Such a shame"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Vegas.  I go there at least once a week. I work around some of the best restaurants in the city, so I know good good. From the pizzas,  Russo ' s deli sandwich and pastas this place is top notch. Thanks Tony for a great place."}
{"text":"I love the pizza, house salad and Greek salad, need to try more. I'm looking foreword to the 2nd location, closer to my home in Henderson Excellent!"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for a few months and we decided to do takeout last night.  I had high hopes based on a majority of reviews but was so disappointed.  We ordered;  the White Pizza ( mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheeses with fresh sautéed spinach and garlic).  It looked very appetizing but to me it had no distinctive flavor and seemed bland.  The crust was nice.  Fresh Tomato, Basil and Garlic  Pizza  (Fresh sliced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh garlic and basil, topped with parmesan cheese).  Once again, the presentation was great but it was also on the bland side.  The crust was good.  Eggplant Parmigiana Dinner- (Layered eggplant with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce).  It also came with a generous portion  of Fettuccine Alfredo (although there were other choices) and hot Italian bread.  The alfredo sauce had a weird (not bad-just weird) aroma but it was tasty.    My husband liked the alfredo & Eggplant Parm much better then the pizza. He thought the pizza was good but nowhere near Amore's (his fave).   There is too many other places to get pizza and Italian food in our area so I doubt we would return but I think the potential is there.  Maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I love Mom and Pop places!  It's our neighborhood pizza go to (New York style).  Tony is the best, so friendly and inviting.   Their pizza is excellent and I love the Russo deli sandwich.  The decor is warm and cozy, it's not huge in there but we usually order to go anyways.  They have great lunch specials and a pizza special on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday from 4-9pm.  Go see Tony the owner and support a great local place!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great antipasta salad the pizza was good but not great. I'm not a fan of a pizza that separates the crust from the cheese after the first bite. The crust was very good and my husband loved it. It was not out of this world pizza but still better than most. The service was on point and that is why they received 4 stars. Bathrooms are clean and atmosphere was quaint. Bonus is you have your own tv at each table to watch whatever you want. If you want."}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed. I was ordering pizza for my employees as a thank you for working so hard. First, I am at my place of business managing a few customers so I asked my employee to call and do the order for what everyone else wanted. She was asking me few questions and I asked the guy , who was on speaker, if they had salads. He proceeded to get snotty and ask if I had a menu. First of all, not many people call with a menu in front of them. Secondly, it was a simple question. So I told him my employee had it on her phone , but for the sake of getting back out on my sales floor, I just asked quickly and as to the size of the salad.   At this point I'm annoyed because I told him I apologize, which why do I even need to 've sorry for asking questions, but I did tell him I was trying to handle my customers and this order. To this he replied, \"Welcome to my world.\" Then he handed the phone back to the girl who originally answered the phone and hung up on us the first time we called.   My employees told me to cancel the order after getting the total of $49 and being treated like a burden. I told them I will give this place the benefit of the doubt if the pizza is good. It was awful. The pizza was as thick as a dough ball, little sauce, and burnt at the bottom. It also had a strange after taste.  By far the worst money I have spent"}
{"text":"The Tomato Basil Garlic pizza is delicious! My only complaint would be the lack of sauce."}
{"text":"I'll admit...every since Presto Cafe moved in next store, Russo's has not gotten my love nearly as much as it used to. Coincidentally, I've also cut down my carb intake so that is part of the reason (cheaters always try to justify their actions, right?).   I love the feel of Russo's. It is a family run restaurant that treats their customers like friends. It had been at least 8 months since my last visit, and I genuinely thought the staff remembered me. That is always a nice feeling.   On this trip, I went with my usual, fettuccine alfredo and a side salad. I love the side salad. First, its massive and easy to share. Second, the ranch is incredible. I don't know if they make their own ranch, but if not, I'd buy this stuff by the bucket. I also got garlic cheese bread which is always a winner.   I am glad I ate here for lunch though, because of my lack of excess carb intake, I was ready to sleep by 3pm. It made me remember why I don't eat here very often, but not because of the food or the service. I just can't get away with falling asleep at 3pm.   It can be tough going back to an old flame, especially when the new one is right next door. But when that old flame treats you well, you cannot say no."}
{"text":"A born and raised New Yorker living in Las Vegas for 6 years. This is the only thing close to NY pizza. Honestly, the previous owner is still making pizza there and he is the reason its so authentic!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint, with extras, like chop salad, calamari, and more. The pizza was pretty good with emphasis on crust and sauce. The chop salad was a like whoa. Wasn't expecting all that flavor. Man it was good. We will definitely be coming back.    Would like to try more items on the menu, like greek salad, and some of the main courses.   Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the guy behind the counter seemed a little peeved we came in at 8:30 and they close at the early hour of 9.  Cmon, this is Vegas, what pizza place closes at 9!  Overall very happy and will be comming by to sample the slices and more salads."}
{"text":"A place my fat ass and stingy wallet can agree on.   I came here a couple times with my co-workers for lunch. For $4.99, you get two generous slices of pizza and a soft drink. They use pretty good quality ingredients; the dough is fresh made, they use special imported cheese, and they are generous with the toppings. The places is kind of small and it gets a little busy around lunch time.   My street creds: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas I've had so far. There's weekday specials and pizza I found to be quite large.  There are Tvs at all the tables so you dont get bored waiting. The decor was interesting also."}
{"text":"I've had their food before and it's always been good.  I learned about it from a friend.  I'm only doing a 3 star because it is a pricy pizza and there's not a lot of substance to it.  But it is good!!!  I have worked for a couple family restaurants and have no issue paying a premium price but this one needs more for the price.  I'll still go back!!!"}
{"text":"So today was our first time back since about a month ago and we are hugely dissapointed. The restaurant is under new management and let me tell you when things are horrible they are horrible. Compared to when Tony owned it and ran it.   Food and service are horrible.  We came in sat down like we normally do and we were not greeted or even eye contact made like when Tony was there with his daughter. The girl at the counter was standing there not paying attention until i said excuse me do you need me to come to the counter to order she said no shell be around. She came with menus and asked if we wanted drinks and to let us know that the pizzas will be taking longer because normally the oven is turned on ahead of time but this time someone forgot..uhmmmmm okay.... that didnt sound like when Tony ran it. I told her we were ready to order. We ordered our lunch usual (2 slice and a drink) X2 and cheese sticks to come out together as a meal. Within 6 minutes the cheese sticks were delivered which i specified for it to be delivered with our meal.  Within the next 15 minutes she delivered my order but not my daughters. So i waited until it came to the table and 5 minutes later she noticed i wasnt eating and came over and asked if everything was okay, i told her we were waiting on my daughters 2 slices, she said oh they burnt so we are making a new one. At this point i am beyond irritated. We waited 30 mins to eat our pizza.   All our pasts visits have never been anything compared to this. We will not be back after this. We made Russos one of our fave spots and now we are no longer gonna be coming back."}
{"text":"$40 for 2 12 inch pizzas that were delivered by a driver who complained of the 5 mile distance. Pizzas were extremely soggy. Called to let thrm know and told \"will cook them longer next time.\" Horrible service and worse pizza do not eat here."}
{"text":"I saw lots of positive reviews, so I decided to give them a try.  I ordered the 18\" Carmine's Special.  Customer service was great, very friendly.  The pizza however was terrible. Crust tasted like it was previously frozen, very bland. The pizza overall lacked flavor.  Didn't seem like there was much pepperoni or sausage on the pizza, but plenty of onion/bell peppers.  I rarely don't finish pizza, but there's no chance. I've got half a pizza left over in the fridge, and that's going into the trash. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat on your lunch break. It is a family environment, the owner is very nice, the food is great, the waiting time is short, the service is great and it is close to work! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"It could be great. The sauce lacks enough flavor for my tastes. Seems a bit watery too. The staff was pretty friendly and attentive, but then again there are only 8 or so tables in there. The wings were pretty good and the fingers left a little to be desired. Loved the ranch."}
{"text":"Have yet to try anything else on the menu.  But their Italian Cheesesteak Sandwich is pretty good. When I ordered it to go the 1st time, my boyfriend ate the half I had left over and he liked it.  However as I'm sitting here eating the sandwich, I realized there was hardly any steak in it this time around. Minus a star for that.  Liked the fact that the restaurant had the old school pizza parlor feel to it, with the white and red checkered table covers."}
{"text":"Great food, small place but cozy. We love The Russo family! Pizza is wonderful, eggplant parm is delicious"}
{"text":"Pizza is great but they don't answer your phone call if you want to order a take out and it's past 8:30. The girl who told us they don't deliver anymore said she wasn't going to answer the phone after 8:30. So rude."}
{"text":"This place is okay, service isn't very good , food tastes good on some days, other days its bleh"}
{"text":"Great pizza if you want real NY pizza! It's hard to find a good pizza in vegas. No one can get it right. But these guys do!!"}
{"text":"Love Russo's! We don't live anywhere near Russo's, but when we want the best Pizza, that's where we go."}
{"text":"My fiancé INSISTED that I give Russo's a five-star rating.  Since he favors himself a \"pizza connoisseur,\" my fiancé has dragged me to every pizza joint in the city.  Therefore, when he proclaims that something is worthy of five stars, I listen.  In this case, I also completely agree.  I'll freely admit that I was pretty ho-hum when he told me he had a \"bitchin' new pizza place\" for us to try tonight, as that usually means that I'm going to be subjected to some cold, limp, mall-quality pizza in the back of some building in an abandoned alley.  The boy lacks discretion sometimes - he'd eat a flat tire if someone put pizza sauce on it.  However, my hasty judgment (in this case anyway) was a bit premature.   Russo's is cute, complete with checkered vinyl tablecloths and a TV at every table.  Yep, I said it.  A separate TV at every table.  If you ask, they'll give you the remote so you can change the channels yourself.  Awesome.  We were greeted quickly by a friendly young waitress who remained attentive and helpful throughout the meal.  We ordered a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, jalapeño, olive, and tomatoes.  I had a side salad with ranch as well.  The side salad was crisp and cool with thin (yet creamy) ranch.  It was a decent size for the $3 (or so) I paid.  When the pizza came out, I thought we could finish the whole thing in one sitting.  I mean, it was plenty big (we got the largest size), but I know my fiancé's capacity to wolf down pizza is almost unmatched.  Boy, was I wrong.  The crust has a light, crispy texture that stands up well to the weight of the toppings.  Although it gives the appearance that one could eat massive quantities, it's actually very filling.  The toppings were very generous as well.  The real highlight was the sliced (not crumbled) sausage.  The taste was reminiscent of Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan, one of my favorite pizza places in town.  However, it was refreshing finding the same high-quality pizza without having to deal with the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  I was full after a single slice, so that left a good portion of the pie to bring home (even after my fiancé decided to unbutton his pants to make room for more... that's his sign that a pizza is good!).  It's sitting in our fridge right now, just begging to become a midnight snack.  For the price we paid I feel we got a good value, especially when you factor in the leftovers.  I really don't know why one would feel it necessary to go to Pizza Hut or Domino's when there are high-quality, affordable, family-owned pizza places like this in the Valley.  Good job, Russo's."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Russo's so my husband and I USED to order from them until tonight!  3 nights ago I ordered a chopped salad and 2 cheese slices and they were delivered in less than 15 minutes.  Tonight, I called to order 2 cheese slices, 2 meatballs and a cup of soup and they told me they don't deliver slices!!!  My husband and I took our in-laws there for dinner and when we wanted a to go box, the owner's daughter came with her bare hands and touched our food right in front of us and put it in a box!!  I was livid as I have been in the restaurant business for some time.  But, I LET IT SLIDE even after the afternoon event we had with the owners daughter and her babys father getting into a domestic dispute in their place of business.  When dad works, the pizza's good, when hes off, don't order!  The daughter is rude and arrogant.  The health department needs to pay them a visit.  They lost me as a costumer, and should know NEVER to touch food while handling money!!!"}
{"text":"Back again and still great! Just tried the pepperoni roll and it was amazing!  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow! I couldn't finish it....although I did want to because it was so good lol. Same great customer service!  Owner is in the kitchen making the food. We also had the garlic bread it's made fresh! Perfection!  I very much appreciate their quality of service and food!"}
{"text":"Great eggplant parmesan! Very friendly owners. They took over the place in Oct 2017. Excellent! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is the pizza i have been craving for a long time. F'ing amazing food and service. Each table has a tv as well."}
{"text":"This used to be a very good restaurant.  New owners took over the Summer of 2017.  Since then have seen this restaurant go down hill.  Owner does not seem to know how to run a business.  There used to be white table cloths on the tables.  They were replaced by patterned vinyl table cloths.  Now the table tops are bare with paper place mats.  Worse yet, they are reusing the paper place mats.  You can feel rough surfaces were a plate, bowl, or glass has been on the place mats.  And, I have witnessed the owner touching pizza with bare hands that were recently doing money transactions at the cash register.    The Health Department needs to make a visit to this establishment.  All they need to do is ask a few questions and the owner will be totally confused.  Been there, done that, but no longer.  It is a shame!  In a good strip mall but will choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Planting its stakes on South Rainbow Boulevard long before the street's recent rejuvenation as a dining corridor, the switch from Carmine's Pizza Kitchen to Russo's occurring somewhere around the start of this decade, it was after passing by the space several times that the decision was finally made to stop in for lunch on Friday, a recent change in ownership par for the course in a shopping complex that formerly housed Elements and launched four new Restaurants including Meraki in the last twelve months.  Best described as a New York Pizzeria, the checkered tablecloths, decorations including Grapes as well as oil paintings and Rat Pack soundtrack all creating the stereotyped environment of a place in Little Italy, guests entering Russo's Pizza Kitchen will quickly be struck by the space's intimate confines, a total of less than a dozen tables spread out in front of an open window and multi-tiered oven.  Unaware of the ownership change until afterwards, a look at the business' Social Media including a post in October stating \"Dear Friends, I am no longer at Russo's Pizza Kitchen due to unforeseen circumstances that were out of my control.  Sincerely, The Russo Family,\" it was shortly after seating that a youthful female waitress approached the table with menu and a glass of Ice Water, an order previously arranged based on the website's menu quickly derailed by the absence of Garlic Knots which led to a quick adjustment with some for now and the rest for later.  Allowing approximately 55 minutes for lunch exclusive of driving time, presumably plenty for a quick-service Restaurant with less than a ten total diners present and limited take-out or delivery volume as judged by the driver only leaving once with just two boxes, it was shortly after the order was placed that two Meatballs swimming in thin Marinara were delivered, the grind good and noticeably including Cheese at a good portion for just $3.95 though it would have admittedly been nice to have a slice of Bread or some Knots for dipping.  Taking an inordinate amount of time to warm two previously made slices, the cause for this audibly heard to be a mistake as the young waitress twice had to tell a white haired man behind the counter \"One Cheese, one Pepperoni,\" as she offered an extra slice of the latter to a regular guest gratis, it was nearly twenty minutes after seating that the $4.95 lunch combo arrive, the free Drink passed up as nothing in the aged Coke machine sounded appealing while the slices were warm and decent, though the Cheese was a bit too oily and clearly not high grade as judged by its consistency.   Eating the two slices fairly quickly, the serving temperature not so hot as to require any sort of cooling to avoid burning one's mouth even though the thin crust did pick up a light bit of char, it was nearly ten minutes later that the waitress stated \"Zeppoli will be ready in just a few minutes,\" an actual total of seven seeing several varying sizes of fried Dough presented beneath a pile of powdered sugar with two bottled Sauces, the larger pieces nice and fluffy but the smaller ones  bit too chewy and neither the portion nor the quality worth $8.95.  At this point pressed for time, the rest of the order ready and waiting, it was approaching the counter with a coupon that the situation suddenly turned from average to subpar, the waitress unaware of how to enter the order appropriately and thus provoking a lengthy call to an off-site owner who would not give her a password to adjust the price for unknown reasons, the Credit Card eventually dialed in by one of those old-school scanners (that the server dropped onto an exposed Pizza) and to-go items handed over, the luke-warm Calzone decent but compromised by watery Ham slices that made the Ricotta runny and messy while the Cheesecake actually turned out to be a highlight, the use of a bit of Gelatin rendering the texture smooth and creamy while sweetness was graciously restrained.   **1/2  Uncertain regarding the quality previously, though it would seem likely that service and billing issues were better under prior ownership, Russo's Pizza Kitchen is a decent choice for those in the area, though considering the diversity of Las Vegas' Pizza scene in general there are plenty of better options both nearby and  throughout town."}
{"text":"I found a new place to eat.  Great atmosphere, everyone working and dining here is super friendly.  This place replaces my frequent visits to Carmine's seeing how they all closed down on my side of town.  Food is almost identical.  I guess the owner purchased the restaurant from Carmine's owner.  I will definitely continue to come here and I highly recommend Russo's to all locals and visitors.  They also have very reasonable lunch specials under $6.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"New ownership. Service: if I have nothing nice to say, I won't. Food: ditto Will leave the above with that."}
{"text":"This is the best place for Italian food and best pizza,I went with my family and their is great service, she (Ivonne waitress) offered a welcome garlic nuts and that was amazing nuts, they are free to all customers, we order pasta's and pizza and it delicious great, and this is a real Italian food I know the test cause I'm from Italy and I recommend to everybody to visit the restaurant and the prices are not to expensive they have specials for lunch for $4.95 and also daily specials."}
{"text":"I had their fried calamari this time and it was excellent! It comes served with a marinara sauce for dipping. ...See prior reviews for pizza. ...I dig this place. It is a must go-to, off the strip, family owned restaurant with GREAT food. ...My only complaint was the family bickering that I could clearly hear coming from the back kitchen area."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved eating at ruddos. I came here for an Italian dinner with my family and it was excellent. My mom had the lasagna and it had tons of cheese and meat and was awesome. My dad had the chicken parmesan and it had tons of sauce and cheese and was great. I had the linguini and sausage and the sausage was cooked perfectly and the linguini was topped with tons of sauce. The salad was great too. The bread was awesome. They have a good variety of beer at a very reasonable price. Overall if you love Italian food please come and try Russo's you will not regret it."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place!  Been meaning to post on here for a while!  They are so friendly and very accommodating.  We always Order the pepperoni pizza with extra thin crust well done and it is delicious. The Caesar salad is good.  Try this place."}
{"text":"Today's favorite, the pene pasta.  It's delightful.  I love sausage and when I see a dish on the menu with it, I usually will try it.  And this was very good.    The sauce is made with pink vodka, it's very light and full of flavor.  They add some peas and onions and then toss in the ground sausage and pene pasta.  Each of the little pasta tubes is covered with the sauce and you can taste the cheese, creamy flavors exploding in your mouth with each bite.  I would try this again.  Good food, great service, and a full menu that I would love to try, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a plain cheese pie. When I picked it up I noticed my normal pizza guy wasn't making the pie(weird). Asked them where he was and they said no longer here. Took the pie home and it wasn't the same. Very disappointed. Pizza is still better than dominos or Pizza Hut.  Please change the name so no one will get confused thinking they're getting a Russo's pizza or hire the guy back."}
{"text":"We've been back to Russo's on several occasions since our debacle... They've redeemed themselves by delivering a quality pizza that tastes good and is very fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Great humble atmosphere, and friendly staff all around. If I ever want pizza, I know this place will satisfy my needs.   They are local, convient, and priced fairly. Any good review from other yelper's about this place is true, so I wont go into details; you'll just have to find out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"First order (February 2013): I picked up a Russo's special which was topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions.  The pizza was mediocre all the way and we were in no rush to order from here again.    Second order (September 2013): We had last minute guests coming over to watch the Sunday afternoon football games.  Since this is the closest pizza to my house, I gave it another shot and ordered a large sausage mushroom for pickup.  This pizza was actually pretty great.  Even our guests thought so and I was pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't believe this was the same place to be honest.    Third order (November 2013): An old buddy living in Boston was raving about chicken parm sandwiches around the Fenway area.  So that got me thinking to the last time I had a great chicken parm sub which was probably when Clinton was president.  I bit the bullet and got one to go.  Although the bread was decent, the chicken was bland and under seasoned as was the tomato sauce.  It was pretty blah overall.  The sub came with a small side of potato salad that was FROZEN.  My initial thought was that the crunch in my mouth was celery but it was ice!  Nice!    I called to inform them of this and the cashier simply just said \"Sorry.\"  The owner called me 3 minutes later to apologize again.  He said there was something wrong with his fridge, everything froze over and blamed his cook for not noticing.  I'll probably end up ordering from here again due to proximity but will drive that extra few miles to get pizza elsewhere for sure.  I wonder how many pizza chefs they have?  Maybe I need to obtain their shift schedule."}
{"text":"Pizza flavor was tasty but the crust was hard and tasteless. When I mentioned it to the owner, his excuse was very poor. He said the weather was affecting how the dough comes out and that affects the texture and flavor.  After coming from New York and eating great pizza for over 40 years, I can say that was a bad excuse. It has happened twice and we will no longer go to Russo's."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this little gem on National pizza day as I was looking for a decent spot for a slice and drink for lunch.  I'm so glad I found this place!  I was greeted immediately with a warm welcome and friendly smile.  They have great lunch specials!  I got the 2 slices and a drink for $5!!!  The pizza was delicious!  Service was great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a large pizza... normally I am not a fan of NY-style pizza, but this was pretty good!  Ultimately I believe it's a perfect combination of sauce, cheese, and crust that either makes or breaks a pizza.  The crust had a lot of flavor and was a good combination of soft and firm (so each slice would bend and flop, but was still strong enough to hold up all those toppings when you folded it)... and the cheese was tasty good... but there was very little sauce.  Next time i would order extra sauce on the pizza, but this time I ended up ordering an extra cup of sauce.  They were very accommodating, but the extra cup of sauce was cold.  They told me it would be... but it whatchagonnadoaboutit?     Anyway, the overall taste of the pizza was good, but the somewhat-sauceless pizza is my reason for the four-star rating."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and give it a big thumbs up! Pizza was great and the two slice cheese pizza with a drink lunch special ($4.95 + $1 for additional topping) is well worth it. Will make this a regular lunch stop for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious little pizzeria, tucked away in a small eatery center. Family owned, and with New York origins, this place was super cute, super clean, super delicious and super fresh. We ordered the Greek salad which was very fresh and crisp, the calamari which was so light and fresh and just downright delicious, the bucket of chicken wings (which did not come in a bucket but were instead served in a nicer oblong plate with the creamiest ranch dressing on the side) and the Russo's supreme pizza to which we added olives, ham, and jalapenos for a dollar each. All our appetizers were so light and fresh, that it really made the difference while we waited for our pizza. Usually appetizers will sit heavy and then by the time your entree comes, you don't really have room for more food, but not here, and I really think it's due to the way the food was prepared. Just as you would expect from a small, authentic, family-owned restaurant, our food was made with utmost attention and the freshest ingredients. I would give this place 5 stars if only our pizza order hadn't been messed up. While we had ordered a supreme with added toppings, when our pizza came out, it only had the 3 added toppings we had asked be added. Our server without hesitation immediately apologized and took it from us with a real \"We're gonna make this right\" attitude which we really appreciated. We would've been happy if the other toppings had been cooked aside and just tossed on our pizza, because not gonna lie, we were eager to eat it! But the chef made us an entirely new pizza, and he did so super quickly! We felt bad because our pizza was huge and we were worried the first pizza was gonna get tossed but when we asked for our to go box, our server boxed our left overs and came back with the first pizza in a box as well and we were so relieved because perfectly good food shouldn't be thrown out! Of course we weren't charged for the first pizza and now we have dinner for the rest of the week! haha. And despite that little mix-up, it was definitely a delicious experience and a much better option than a fast food pizza chain. Certainly much pricier, but worth it, considering all the food we got out of it!"}
{"text":"I drove really far to get to this place and eat. I arrived ten minutes to closing time. The cashier told me they were \"closed\" because they had a slow night.  This makes no sense to me. They are slow so they reject a customer?"}
{"text":"J'adore eating here! I'll review in backwards order. The homemade cheesecake is the best. All the pizzas are good especially pepperoni. Service is usually ;) quick."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm and Lasagna are the real deal.   Reasonably priced.   Generous portions.  We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is the best you have to try it.. my boss orders food from here for lunch and I went with my bf on my day off and we love it."}
{"text":"I come to Russo's regularly for lunch, and mostly order the lunch special w/ meatball & jalapeño. I love the atmosphere and friendly customer service, it makes the experience even better.  Their pizza is the best pizza I have had so far. The crust is nice and golden brown (most of the time, sometimes it is a little burnt), and they put the right amount of sauce, cheese, and they give you a pretty good amount of toppings (I love it). Their slices are huge (a couple of times I got a medium to small sized pizza), one slice was the equivalent of two pieces of pizza (I was so happy when I saw the size of their pizza!)!!  I highly recommend their pizza!  Other then the pizza their other menu items are pretty average (haven't tried everything). I enjoyed their Ceaser salad. The grilled chicken had that smokey taste, it was delicious.  Overall I'm a Russo's pizza fan!! I'm seriously addicted..  4.5 out of 5 in my book"}
{"text":"Super cute family place!  Got some complimentary garlic knots that were awesome!!!  We got the white pizza with fresh ricotta and mozzarella - crust was crisp and cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the pizza yet, but holy hell is the Italian Cheese Steak good! Very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ordered an 18' pizza with pepperoni, garlic bread with cheese, and antipasto salad. The pizza was huge. It could have fed 6 people. Reasonable price and great portions. If you're looking for a quick meal give it a try."}
{"text":"1 star is for Terrible service only! Only young girls are the servers so they are really lacking in customer service. You don't get the service you are expecting, they will not check on you after they give you your food and it takes them a while to take your order and the place is not even busy. I got up and refilled my own cup, she never came back to see if we needed anything.  Food well... now that's another story.... Pasta Fagoli is excellent, authentic Italian! Pizza is good."}
