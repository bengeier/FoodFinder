{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've had in years. The worst I believe is the owners wife, who has been extremely miserable every time I've had the misfortune of eating there. Food is good, but not worth the experience. Actually left after she took our order she was so rude. Won't ever go back again."}
{"text":"Will NEVER go back. Have patronized the restaurant many, many times for breakfast with and without a group of friends. The service is often poor, and often with an attitude, and food is mediocre at best. We would go for the company of our friends. This mornings breakfast the absolute worst! Slow service ( again with that nonverbal attitude like the waitress was being put out) ... And the food horrible! Eggs needed sent back for being underdone.. And my husband's omelet actually tasted like the ham was rancid! We didn't raise a big fuss.. Simply brought it to their attention and received more nonverbal attitude! ...again, there with friends and enjoying our conversation. But here's the topper.... Our group of 8 was TOLD to leave because they had another large party waiting!! There were multiple empty tables everywhere!! And what's even worse than that offensive behavior was that of the owner Sam.. As I was telling him that we would not be back to his restaurant he literally said that was fine by him...wow, what a great way to run a business!! I have never been so appalled by the behavior of a business establishment in all of my life...and I'm certainly going to let everyone know about it! He obviously doesn't need or want the business ( at least  ours). I would not recommend this restaurant if it was the last one open. Poor service, poor food, poor ownership. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star."}
{"text":"Really good lunch options. They now added dinner again. German food is one of their specialties."}
