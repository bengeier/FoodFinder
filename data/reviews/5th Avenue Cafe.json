{"text":"This place is fantastic. Every time I eat there I am not disappointed. The staff is friendly and the food is phenomenal. The place is always super clean and is just a very nice place to eat"}
{"text":"My husband discovered this place and it's a great place to eat.  Service is fast and accurate.  We've been there oodles of times and it is always good.  Convenient to St. Joe's and Phoenix College.  You know it's good when you see cops in there all the time."}
{"text":"If it's available try the weekend special Country Benedict - Poached eggs, house made meatloaf (very yummy) with sausage gravy on an English muffin - outstanding! Food and service is always terrific."}
{"text":"Comfy, cheap, good service. Exactly what I want from a small cafe. I like to come here in the morning before class to eat breakfast & chug down cup after cup of coffee - never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place! It's not bad, but more of a big disappointment!  My boyfriend and I love corned beef hash; it's our big Saturday morning breakfast after a hike or being lazy. Whichever. So after an early morning loop at Dreamy Draw park we decided to go out for hash and found this place. We were among the first customers to walk the through the door. The hostess was friendly and we heard her greeting the few other patrons by name.  Okay so we get some coffee and order our hash. I noticed a few faint bits of lipstick on my mug, yuck. My boyfriend swapped with me and wiped it off because he says he isn't that picky, but still! So then I noticed the wall at our booth was rather grimy as well. But I digress.... We are starving and really looking forward to a big, hearty breakfast! WELL!!! Imagine our surprise when it comes out and there is a small portion of hash that looks like it came out of the same type of can we pick up at the grocery store! It was browned and crisped up nicely but I couldn't get over the fact that I was about to pay nearly $8 for half of a $2.50 can of hash that I eat each week anyway!  To be fair, there were 2 eggs, half a plate of hashbrowns and one slice of toast. The eggs were good, the potatoes were clearly thawed from a bag and toast is ....toast.  I'm not complaining that the food was bad, it wasn't, I'm familiar with canned hash so I couldn't complain. It was all so underwhelming and then the bill came which pushed it over the edge. $21?! A tad overpriced. A cup of mediocre coffee was $2 and I think the half-can-of-hash breakfast was about $1.50 more than I was comfortable paying.  Maybe it's the area, Willo is a high rent district for central Phoenix. I'm not cheap, I make a decent buck but this was not a good value therefore I will not be back. Neither will my boyfriend."}
{"text":"It's ok if you were stranded at St Joes and had no other options, but this is still iffy because they have weird hours.  Staff was very friendly, but they always seemed like they were in trouble. Very wide range of food types."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out since I've lived down the street for a while (I prefer ma and pop dive breakfast places better than any Denny's or a fancy shmancy place always). Super disappointed, wah waaah . They DO have a full bar, while only being opened till 2pm!! I wanna just sit and watch to see who the hell is getting plowed before 2! But, probably not going back. I like cooked food, not WHITE pancakes and sausage patties."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Just the perfect brunch experience and great prices. The owner was everywhere, cleaning, greeting, serving, etc. Very nice to see. An absolutely wonderful neighborhood place to eat!"}
{"text":"Found 5th Ave Cafe while taking some tech training downtown phoenix and really wish I had found them the first day.   First three days I tried everything from the hospital cafeteria to IHOP but it wasn't until I tried this place that I felt like I had finally got a good breakfast for a good price.   Food came out quick and tasted great.  Service was quick and attentive and my coffee cup never went dry.   This is definitely going to be my go to pave when downtown Phoenix from now on."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. We really enjoyed the place. Nice atmosphere, very good service and tasty food. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Today (Mother's day) was our first time at the Cafe. Even though it was crazy busy the staff was friendly and attentive. I had the Cowboy Scramble and it was delicious! My girlfriend had the special, Polish Sausage, and it was amazing! The perfect amount of horseradish spice.   The atmosphere is perfect. The jazz and blues decor on the walls was tasteful without being cluttered. I'm glad we found this place and live less than 10 minutes away! My waste line not so much...  I might have to take a second look at the healthy menu."}
{"text":"The customer service is poor. Went there for breakfast and the \"specials\" can't be ordered because they aren't ready. Then to top it off, was charged $4.22 for 1 cup of coffee and 1 glass of tea. The food consistency is non existent. Recommend any other cafe over this one. Believe in giving any place a second chance, this was their third. Not going back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!!!! This is the second day in a row that we eat breakfast from 5th Ave Cafe... Both days were to go so I can't post a review on the service when dinning in!!!! Good prices"}
{"text":"This is a friendly and quiet cafe for a Friday morning coffee and egg break.  The staff is extremely friendly and efficient. The food was great, not too greasy and my coffee was bottomless due to the attentive, but not annoying, server!  I will definitely be returning. I was telling my boyfriend that 5th Avenue Cafe is our new breakfast joint! We actually left something of value that accidentally was tossed and when we called, they had the dishwasher look through the garbage and it was found!!!!!!! We even told them they could just put the bag outside and we would go through it ourselves.  Thank you thank you!!!! Very kind folks and great food to boot!"}
{"text":"The only place in central phoenix where you can get a perfect diner style breakfast with no wait. The owner is lovely and always recognizes us when we come in. The portions are large, prices are affordable. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I did not like this place.  It was greasy and the food was made with cheep  ingredients. My breakfast sucked.  I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Serious Blah.  Went there with some friends for lunch - some of their friends recommended it. Note to self - do not trust my friends' friends. The patty melt was a big hunk 'o' burger on greasy rye bread. Not enough else on their to taste. The side salad is iceberg blah, the clam chowder is creamy blah, and my friends agreed the Philly sandwich was shoulder-shrugging blah. The waitress was nice enough, but hard a difficult time grasping that I did NOT want a refill of my soda. Really, one giant glass is more than enough, already!"}
{"text":"Wow! Rude, rude, rude.  First in, lady barks at is when we asked if we must wait to be seated. So we sit, and absolutely nothing as a lady wipes off the table in a huff.  Look, this was our first and absolute last time in. If your staff is overworked get them some damn help"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast at 5th Avenue Cafe on 3 occasions, and each time was terrific! The staff is extremely capable, regardless of how busy they are - attentive without being obnoxious. I felt like family from my very first visit. It is becoming my go-to spot for breakfast out."}
{"text":"This place is a greasy spoon, and I love it.  When I walked in the door I knew that it was my kind of place.  I thought to myself, \"Feels good to mingle with these laid back country folk.\"  It has the atmosphere of a small town diner.  I actually forgot for a moment that I was in the heart of one of the biggest cities in the United States.  The food is top notch too. For whatever reason I enjoy my lunch and dinners to be a bit gourmet, but my breafast to be greasy and simple.  I got three pancakes, three eggs, 2 pieces of sausage, and hashbrowns all for $6.25.  These days it's hard to find a deal like this.  I would recommend this place to people looking for a small town diner feel, tasty food, and good prices."}
{"text":"Was excited to come here after reading the reviews I didn't wait around to give it a chance to try the food the service was so poor it was unbelievable busboys seem to be the only ones working. Waitresses too busy chit chatting behind the counter. I waited for 10 minutes and not one waitress ever walked over"}
{"text":"My hubby & I came her for lunch about 2 weeks ago.  I could tell from the building that this place had been around for a while. The tables had random business advertisements on them. Definitely different, but kinda cool.  I ordered the grilled cheese & opted for both the bacon & ham on sourdough bread with fries. My hubs got  the turkey melt on sourdough bread with fries. My sandwich was pretty yummy, hubs not so much. The fries were ok, nothing above average.  The other lunch options didn't look too exciting so I don't think I would come here for lunch again but from the other reviews maybe for breakfast? We shall see!"}
{"text":"We went back for more!  We were in a time crunch and concerned that we wouldn't get breakfast on time.  However, we were able to order quickly and our food was served shortly after we ordered and it was as TASTY as always.  This kitchen is consistent with its food portions and flavors everytime we go.  I love how all the waiters work together and everyone is willing to help you. See you again 5th Avenue Cafe!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced food with good service. Felt like a home cooked meal. :) I would come back and dine in again !"}
{"text":"I like to stop when at the hospital. Good food for a great price. Courteous staff too!  Stop on Friday for fish specials. Had the clam chowder today. YUM"}
{"text":"So we have two weeks in Phoenix, and we came with a list of old favorite places, and 5th Ave Cafe was on the list!  I always order the Chorizo Cowboy Skillet with corn tortillas and add a side of bacon.  This is probably not good for me.  My wife orders the Mediterranean Omelet with a side of fruit. This is probably better for her.    In either case, we consistently enjoy our breakfasts here.  In fact, out of all the breakfast places in Phoenix, this is the one that we both enjoy every time.  The service this morning was quick, and in spite of a huge rush, the servers were kind of awesome."}
{"text":"Generally dependable and good. French toast is among the best in town. They also offer excellent lunch specials at very reasonable prices. It's my default diner for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place!! I've only been here twice now, but I'm sold.  First off, the prices are awesome!! The first visit we tried to choose the most expensive things on the breakfast menu because we were trying to spend $20 to use a gift certificate... With coffee we still only hit $16. No problem though, we are stoked to go back!!   The coffee was excellent, and not too strong like some diners tend to do. Heavy, wide-lipped mugs only added to my drinking pleasure.  Hash browns were superb, and I tend to rate places based on their potatoes, so that's a win for me.  The decor is comfortable and welcoming, plus there's an antique trombone hanging on the wall... high-five for that. The bathroom is through the back, and it's a tiny half-bath style you would see in someone's house. I like that about it too, because it adds to the comfortable atmosphere. My only complaint is both times I was there, the floor was extremely wet, like some pipe is leaking but no one has bothered to figure out which one.  There are also TVs in here, which seems weird but is actually kind of nice if you are there on Sunday and feel like watching a game. Bloody Marys seem to be the drink to order for Sunday morning breakfast and brunch! For the size of the place and the items on their menu, they have a decent beer selection as well.  The other great thing about this place is they are conveniently located just off the light rail route, so it's very easy to hop off on Central and Thomas and take a nice stroll down for breakfast. (You get to pass Pink Spot too, in case you are hankering for some ice cream after your meal!) Riding the light rail is a big plus now that I've moved to the east valley, but still love coming downtown."}
{"text":"It was decent and not very expensive. The 3 egg, 3 pancake, 3 bacon plus hash browns was only 8.95. The same breakfast minus the pancakes was 6.95.   The quality of the food was average. The eggs, hash browns and pancakes were good. The bacon was so crispy it was burnt and the sausage links had a similar texture to the ones ar McDonald's. I wasn't impressed.   Overall, I would go back. But it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood diner feel. Food was really good. Thick cut bacon was amazing! Service was wonderful too. Recommend this cute little place to all."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law was visiting Phoenix so my wife and I took the opportunity to head up to Phoenix to spend a couple of days with him. We had breakfast at this café, and it turned out to be a fantastic find. Ample parking was a great start and friendly greetings walking in. If I see the Country Fried Steak on the breakfast menu, it's a go-to. Some of the best I have ever had, and I lived in the south for twenty years! My wife had the green chile and cheese omelet and ate every bite. The staff was very nice. When we were leaving, they were putting tables together for a large group of ladies having their breakfast get-together--very accommodating. I'll be back next time we head up the road from Tucson!"}
{"text":"Love love love this cafe! My family and I go there on the weekends for breakfast. The host is the sweetest, friendliest guy ever. The servers are nice and make you feel at home. Very attentive and friendly. The place is clean and always has the news on several t.v.'s, and there is always good music playing. The food is delicious and well priced. The coffee is incredible, and the cheese Danish is the best in town. Im not sure why anyone would give the 5th ave cafe less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister and her family.  My niece was in a 4-year-old funky mood, and the hostess charmed her right out of it!  You can't put a price on that!  I don't remember what I ate, so that tells me the food was pretty average.  I was intrigued by the fact that they have a full bar, yet are only open for breakfast and lunch.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Very good food with friendly staff. Excellent experience @ a fair price. The steak and eggs breakfast is awesome."}
{"text":"The minute I come in and sit down one of the waiters is at our table with a soda for me and water for my partner. As soon as he picks up our plates, he is back with a soda to go for me. Food is out fast and always fantastic."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, fast service, & delicious food that is inexpensively priced!  I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I love it here! A walk through the back door and it feels like your in another city. Reminded me of Portland, OR. The place is really relaxed and comfy.  The breakfast was sooo goooodd! They actually had a veggie scramble! Veggies, eggs, hash browns, mmm.  The pancakes were a-ok, toast was tasty, just that damn veggie scramble was fantastic.  Service was standard, the place was kind of clean, table smelled funky but it wasn't distracting from the food.  Got much more food than would have at iHop and it was still cheaper"}
{"text":"To start with - super-cheap, stick to your ribs breakfast food. Try the Cowboy Scramble - tasty, large portions, and filling. Iced tea was very good, the super-nice waitress (Gabby) brought us an entire pitcher for our table of four. Efficient, friendly service, and did I say cheap already? It's a great place for a good breakfast (not fancy or pretentious) for well under 10 bucks a person. I must say that I really like this place - oh, and there is LOTS of off-street parking in the lot behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this place has such good reviews. Maybe it is under new ownership since the last one.   I was at the 5th Avenue Cafe this morning (my first visit) for a breakfast meeting and it was one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. The staff sat around talking with each other and anytime we asked for anything, like wanting to order or get refills, it was as though we were ruining their day. The fruit we were given was rotten and the staff didn't seem to care that it was rancid.   The place seems dirty, the walls were filthy and my water glass was either very old or dirty. After the meeting I went to the ladies room and it smelled horrible and I noticed, just in time, that there was fecal matter all over the toilet.   This place is in desparate need of some rejuvenation, some attitude adjustments and just some overall care.  Needless to say, I won't be back ever and I won't be recommending this place to anyone. There are too many good restaurants in this area if you are considering this place I would suggest you go else where."}
{"text":"So my wife, my 8 month old daughter and I stopped by randomly last weekend as we couldn't get into our original destination due to a parade.  My wife has a couple of dietary restrictions because of our child's sensitivities which makes going out to eat a bit difficult but not impossible.  The staff at 5th Ave made us feel like we'd been going there for years.  She can't have soy or dairy or the little one gets 'backed up' and our waitress and the manager bent over backwards to ensure that we were in the clear.  We've hit up all of the high end restaurants in the Phx/Scotts area during our stay here and I must say they were more accommodating than the majority of those places. Just wonderful and sincere people all around.  The food was great, the service was 5 star.  Thank you guys so much for making our rare Saturday outing so easy and enjoyable.  Its something we still talk about and truly appreciate.  See you soon."}
{"text":"Great local cafe, their eggs are always cooked to perfection and the staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  My best friend and I have Sunday brunch here at least 3 times a week if not more.  Since we typically order the same thing every time because it's so darn good, they always know our order by heart.  We never have to wait for service and are brought beverages as soon as we sit down!  The gentleman who busses tables and brings beverages always serves with a smile and asks how we are doing.  All the servers are great but we always try to sit in Gabby's section as she is AWESOME!  Dawn and Earl are the owners and really make all their customers feel at home.  We always see Dawn on Sundays and she always makes it a point to come to come over and say hello.  The food is great- everything we've ever had there is super tasty!  They also do very well with large groups as I brought the entire family over one Sunday, the day after my sister's wedding to have a great brunch.  They were on the ball and extemely pleasant.  I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't yet!!"}
{"text":"They are everything and more of what you expect from a local, neighborhood breakfast/lunch cafe.  They don't pretend to be something they're not.  There's no hype, just some odd decor, good seating (mostly booths),  good food and friendly service.      We meet our friends here for breakfast almost every weekend.  Is it the best breakfast I've ever had? No, but it's always exactly what we order.  The pancakes are great.  The coffee is good and always flowing.  The eggs always come out perfectly cooked.  The egg salad sandwich is a winner.  Friend typically gets a salad and it looks nice and fresh.  There's nothing that really stands out but stick with the basics and you're good to go.    We're never rushed out of our booth even though we stay a little bit longer than we should.  Kelsey knows us all by name and we love being greeted by her smiling face and quirky personality.      I'm always a fan for a place that is clean and makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! This is our family's favorite breakfast spot. Best cheese Danish, delicious waffles, great coffee, super clean, consistent, the owner walks around and greets us every time we come she and the wait staff even asks how our daughters are when we don't bring them. They make you feel at home. Try it and thank me later."}
{"text":"This place seems like it belongs in another part of the country. It's nothing fancy, just a diner where old guys go for breakfast and the newspaper.  The walls are adorned with jazz-related art and knicknacks.  They have a pretty good selection of breakfast items, like pancakes, French toast, scrambles and breakfast bowls, as well as lunch sandwiches, salads and burgers. They include several vegetarian selections, which is much appreciated.  I highly recommend the seasoned red potatoes as a side, they go as marvellously with a burger as they do with French toast.  They will even substitute them for hash browns in your Veggie Cowboy if you ask.  It's also nice and cheap.  All around, a great place to go for a breakfast/lunch on a weekend morning/afternoon."}
{"text":"It has taken me awhile to finally post this review (ummm... hi Yelp App people..... you've made a million updates to the app.... why not a post from app update?!?!)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  You know something that really creeps me out about a place?! ...sticky salt shakers...eeeeew! I mean seriously people... Anyways, I digress.  My friend and I were to be downtown after the R4TC this past Sunday and were looking for a place close enough to the race site to be convenient, yet far enough from it that there would not be a mad rush of other race participants.   We finished the race later than usual, so we arrived at the Cafe around 10:50.  When we entered to the front door, and there were already two other parties in line ahead of us, so we did the logical thing and got in line behind them.  The line was formed by one door, leaving the other door for people to go in and out of (this will be amusing later on in the review).  We stood at the front, there was no host stand nor a spot that was clearly where parties waited to be sat, so we did the lemming thing and stood where everyone else was. On three occasions people just stood outside staring at the blocked door and looked at the line waiting for the whole line to move instead of using the CLEAR door... ummm.. really people?! And of course on all three occasions they had the nerve to be all huffy at us. HA!  Five minutes go by and no one has come to talk to the mass forming at the door, a little miffed, I keep standing there as my friend goes up to the bar/cashier to ask if there is a wait list or something.  Finally, while she is over there a manager? Comes and asks everyone BUT me if we are on the list... ummm.... What I am under the age of 50 so I don't get attention?... just because I may not be your target clientele doesn't mean I am not a paying customer.    Another 10 minutes go by, and after everyone else is sat (including Mr. Huffy Pants that came in after us) we finally get a table.... In the corner, by the office.  Shortly after we are sat someone brings us some water.  And then we wait... and wait... and wait... 10 minutes later someone comes by to ask what we want to drink, we get our coffees and then our server disappears for awhile again.... Now just having done the race and not had anything besides a banana since 6am we were HUNGRY and tired of waiting!   About 45 minutes after we had entered, we finally got to place our orders.  We had to flag people down to get coffee refills 3 times because our server was a magician practicing her disappearing act all morning. Actually, I'm not sure why we kept drinking the coffee because it was old and burnt tasting, but hey caffeine is caffeine. We finally got our food.  sigh.  It was lukewarm, dry (in the case of a waffle), and overcooked.  We were too hungry, and too tired to say anything, but its ok because our server never came by to ask how things were or if we needed anything once we got our food.  Only saw her again when it was time to pay.    We do the R4TC every year, and are always looking for an awesome mom n pop to go to eat at afterwards.... gotta say... this one will definitely NOT make the list."}
{"text":"Great customer service sever was awesome. Food was great. Tried chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy and corned beef. Over med eggs were spot on.  Everything was perfect. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Even if you have to travel a bit to get to it."}
{"text":"First time here, I saw the reviews and we decided to try it out. We ordered, 2 over medium eggs, 2 pancakes, hash browns, 2 slice of bacon (good), and a cup of coffee. Everything came out to $14.60. The food was ok, no wow factor, however for the price, consider Black Bear diner....  The service was ok, the establishment seemed a little dark for me on the inside and dated. Overall, this might be a place I will recommend, if your in the area in last minute....."}
{"text":"I am from Florida and went to the cafe for breakfast with my daughter. The food was excellent, the price was great and service was on spot. We met the owner Dawn as she was the checkout person. What a nice person. We will definitely go back. As a matter of fact, I am going there this morning. I am retired law enforcement and knew it would be clean and good food when I saw Phoenixs best in there."}
{"text":"Well here we are against the 5 the Ave cafe. This has come to be our go to spot. The food is on point as usual and the service awesome. Today we had a very small wait we usually hit just before the rush. It was still only a ten minute wait and then let the food begin. The prices are great portions good size and service with a smile every time. This is your go to for breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"Yelp profile and menu mention full bar, place doesn't serve any alcohol right now.  We were little disappointed since we were looking forward to mimosas with brunch.  It's more of a diner than cafe.  Otherwise seems nice, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now.  It is excellent for \"I just rolled out of bed and want some breakfast or maybe lunch, nothing fancy just stick with what you know\" kind of meals.  The portions are perfect sized, the price is right and they are always consistent.    The waitstaff is competent, ready with a refill, and my favorite balance of pleasant without implying friendship.  This place is old school with ads on the table and when you order eggs over medium the whites are solid and the yolks runny.  Rockstar.  I notice they have a full bar and will some day venture into that arena."}
{"text":"I really enjoy breakfast here and lunch is yummy too. Omelets are great! The Philly Chicken sandwich is YUMMY! The salads look good, but I can't resist my favorites! The staff and owners are friendly! I have my favorites- my food is perfect when I have Zeus! Seriously, you have to try this place, old school vibe with music decor, takes me back to when I was young and you could go to a local restaurant and have delicious, fresh, home-made food... or you can just go to 5th Ave Cafe! Across from the hospital."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm not overly impressed but the pancakes were stellar & I will definitely come back for that reason. My husband ordered an omelette which looked great and he said was good. The hash brown potatoes were good but very oily - so much so that I only ate the top crispy part. I ordered two eggs over medium with sour dough toast & the egg white was runny over the majority of the egg. It also had a pool of oil on top (see pic). The orders of toast which were one slice cut in half were drenched in the butter substitute and soggy. My guess is the butter flavored crisco is used heavily in this kitchen. Keep in mind that I did not bring this to the attention of staff as I'm sure they would have remade the eggs and toast as they were all very nice and excellent servers. I just don't like doing that. The iced tea was very good."}
{"text":"oh my goodness. this was my first time here but it certainly won't be my last! I had the corned beef and it's already a rarity to find and to find somewhere that makes it great even harder but this place is above great. my husband had the cowboy skillet and is now full and asleep haha. they even have sour dough! my favorite. the ambiance is lovely and the staff is just wonderful. they were full with customers on a Friday at 12! awesome! I was even approached by who I think is either the manager or owner asking if my eggs were okay! my cup of coffee was always full. beyond pleased with my dining experience here. keep up the amazing work! we love it and appreciate it."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a long time. We came here for breakfast, it had good standard fare. I only had a Bagel (which was Good)"}
{"text":"Heard such great things so gave it a try on a Saturday late morning. Got there just in time to get a table before they started a waiting list. Got drinks right away but no one took our order for about 15 minutes. Took almost 30 minutes to get our food and then it was mediocre at best.  Skillet was very oily, although ingredients that were special ordered were accurate. Eggs on other meal were over cooked and cold, as was the rest of the food that came with it.  Seems like a lot of regulars go there so maybe this was an unusual day or they get the attention?"}
{"text":"I relocated to Phoenix almost 2 years ago and was on a serious quest to find my \"cheers\" spot and a great breakfast spot.  A whole year past and I just couldn't find my favorite spot.  Then .... I found 5th Ave Cafe while driving one day and gave it a try.  Man oh man!  One of the best random decisions I've ever made lol.... this is my absolute favorite place in the Valley to get breakfast.  My favorite!  And now my boyfriend's favorite!  And now my cousin's favorite whenever she comes to visit.  It's that good!  2 of our absolute favorite dishes: Sausage and gravy, scrambled eggs and bacon.  The other is the buttery croissant sandwich with rosemary potatoes.  We've tried plenty of things, waffles, french toast, salads, plenty of things!  Everything is absolutely divine!  Give them a try!  My goodness ... I can't believe i'm just writing a review on my favorite place!"}
{"text":"This is our weekly breakfast spot - after trying many others we found no match. The food is served by an amazing staff, drinks are kept topped off and the food is consistent. The chorizo and eggs crepes are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love being a Yelper! It's one of my favorite things to do; read reviews and write reviews.  This morning my BFF and I visited this cafe for a late breakfast...brunch?  We celebrated his 50th birthday last evening and awoke feeling a tad rough, as you do after a milestone celebration, and knew we needed food STAT!  Despite it being Sunday, and the restaurant being busy, we sat ourselves and were greeted post haste by a lovely lady. Because I'd checked in here, I asked her what the check-in offer was about...a free high-five with my breakfast order. She looked confused, then promptly gave me a high-five, explaining it was the owners idea of a joke!  Ha! Love it!  Our breakfast orders were then taken and 10 minutes later came to our table.  My BFF ordered the Chorizo Omelette with a side of bacon, while I went with 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, and 2 pancakes. Everything was perfect! Over easy eggs were actually over easy! The bacon was thick cut, smoky sweet, and crispy. The chorizo wasn't overly greasy and was excellently seasoned, and my pancakes were fluffy and served with REAL butter!!  We were asked how our meal was by another lady (never got her name) and when she discovered I was visiting from Tucson and would be driving back within the hour, brought me 2 cups of ice for my trip Home!  Great food! Great, prompt service! This establishment truly cares about their customers!   Thanks 5th Ave. Café!"}
{"text":"Awesome cafe conveniently located across from st Joseph's hospital. Fabulous waitstaff!!! So friendly & helpful. Our breakfast was served hot & prepared as we had ordered. Very decent prices & portions. This is our second time here for breakfast & will be back to try lunch... looking forward to trying the homemade soup."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place!  My breakfast was delicious, service was impeccable and the prices are more than reasonable.  I got a ton of food for less than $7!  I couldn't eat it all.  I'm indecisive so I ordered one pancake and one French toast!  The French toast was absolutely delicious!  My eggs were cooked to perfection and the sausage was yummy.  This restaurant was my last stop before leaving Phoenix.  I had some mediocre food while I was in town bit this restaurants made up for it.  Definitely try it out if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Where's Gabby??  The place just isn't the same anymore :(   Food is good, ambience has been better and you can drink early.    Too bad - this used to be my favorite spot...  Maybe me and all of my friends will have to try First Watch :)"}
{"text":"Just sat down to have breakfast at at Fifth Avenue cafe roach was crawling and countertop portions were ridiculously small and prices were expensive I don't think I'll be returning and I don't recommend this place unless you like a little extra in your food"}
{"text":"Let's just say I had to nurse a hangover this morning and wasn't really feeling Joe's Diner or going to Denny's either. So, I decided to try this place which had some decent reviews. Overall, my impression of this place is good, and it is definitely tucked away inside a non-descript strip mall across the hospital (keep your eyes peeled if you're coming here). This is a good breakfast place. I'd come back, but it's not some place to write home about necessarily.   Food quality was above average and the prices are more than reasonable. For $ 7.95, I got three slices of french toast, 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, and a healthy portion of hash browns. Be forewarned, the portions are sizable. I asked for my eggs scrambled soft, and they did a really good job. Bacon was a little over crispy for my taste. The french toast was yummy and the coffee was pretty good (though I think my hangover could care less what kind of coffee it was). The portion size, the quality for the price earn this cafe some plus points.   This place also has a full service bar, which is a good thing for some place like this to have.   Service definitely earned this place a demerit this time, albeit not a really serious one. The place was not super busy, but it took forever to get my coffee cup refilled. Other than that, service was attentive, friendly, and efficient.   Grades:  Overall Rating: B+   Discretionary Points for price and portion size.   Food Quality: B+  -  Good breakfast food, good job on soft scrambling the eggs and                                    French Toast. Bacon could use significant improvement.   Service: B-   -   When you say you're going to be right back with the coffee pot,                             come right back, don't go behind the counter and have a chat.                             Bring me some damn coffee!  Drinks: N/A - They do have a full bar, but I did not try it. Adding fuel to a hangover                          fire is not that smart."}
{"text":"Great home cooked meals! The owner, Dawn, is super nice and chatted with us like we were family. She even offered to meet up with me for lunch in my current city of Tucson (I was visiting my boyfriend). Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"This Place is just a good cafe, the staff are nice folks. Nothing to give major kudos for with regards to food, especially because you have tons of options in this area for great breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"3 things about this place: 1. Unfortunately, the food is not the best thing about this place, their SERVICE IS the best side about this place. 2. The good news is that the food is almost as good as the service. Big portions, food comes normal/fast (never late). 3. They could be at a better location and update the furniture.   If this place goes with a \"country/farmy\" look and style it will hit the jackpot!"}
{"text":"I wanted to eat breakfast on the cheap side but like everyone else that cares about there life did not want McDonald's .  This place was not busy and I know why service and food subpar . Ok I take over and manage it first order fire the server who rather talk then serve second and most important fire the breakfast cook can't cook eggs and can't get hash browns brown ."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast stop on our way from Phoenix to Sedona. Super friendly staff and good, simple food."}
{"text":"After getting a menu and water they forgot me. I left. Used to be very good starting to slip. Last few times there quality has gone down. Off my braekfast list."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch. I got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries. It was very good. The bun was soft and chicken was juicy. Love this place will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So freaking affordable!  The food is average cafe food, but the coffee is hot and the service is pretty good too.  I've eaten Lunch and Breakfast here, and prefer their breakfast menu.  All of the food is about $5 to $8 and their portions are rather large.  Don't go here if you're looking for healthy or fresh.  Go here if you want greasy hangover food that will fill you up for cheap."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend for lunch yesterday...this little place has been on my list for a while so I was excited to try it.    We arrived at 11:30 and the joint was jumpin.  My buddy ordered a cheeseburger and I had eggs, bacon, hash browns, and rye toast.  The prices are great and we both enjoyed our meals.  This place is not fine dining, by any means, but it really hit the spot!    Parking is tricky but there is a nice lot behind the restaurant, with an entrance nearby   I recommend this place for a quick, unstuffy meal!"}
{"text":"Save your money for lunch.  Today I ordered a Buffalo Lite Salad and it came with COLD and DRY buffalo chicken lightly dripped in buffalo sauce on a bed of lettuce and about a half cup of shredded cheddar cheese.   The amount of cheese was overwhelming and there were really no cucumbers or tomatoes to speak of.  Had about 5 croutons though.  Very dissappointed.  The second disappointment of the day was that the owners also cancled their \"Loyalty\" card program as of 12/31/15.  I understand not issuing new cards as a result of higher egg and meat costs, but to pull the program already in place?  Doesn't feel right.  Your card is only good if you have all 10 visits punched out and it's time for your free one.  But if you were on #9 and today was your 10th visit you're out of luck because the program stopped on 12/31.  So my question to 5th Ave Dinner is, \"Who was loyal to whom?\"  No need to rush back for lunch.  I will say breakfast is usually pretty decent."}
{"text":"I'm sure this restaurant has a devoted following and I can't say enough good things about this place.  Classic diner atmosphere. Even though the restaurant was crowded and there was music playing softly, we had no problem hearing one of the staff welcome us and let us know we could sit where we like. Our server, Zeus, welcomed us and took our drink order within a minute of sitting down.  Drinks: Diet Coke and water with lemon   The drinks arrived promptly and we were ready to order.  Food: Cowboy skillet scramble with tortilla, side of sausage links, French toast with over easy egg, hash browns, orange wedge, bacon, and side of biscuit and gravy.  The food came out really quick! Everything tasted incredible. It's the kind of place that has been cooking their menu with love for a long time so everything has had its deliciousness perfected. Just really outstanding flavor.  Zeus made sure we had everything we needed and kept our drinks refilled throughout the meal without being intrusive. A true masterwork in serving. The check was dropped off nearing the end of the meal at the perfect time. With all that we ordered it was only $30. That's right, all that food and only thirty USD. Pretty amazing.  Again, 5th Avenue Cafe most likely has a huge following already so this news isn't moving any mountains. But if you're looking for a fantastic place with a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and terrific food there is no better place than 5th Ave."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Very good food at reasonable prices.  Be prepared for a wait with large groups and at peak times, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"So when I first moved downtown I came here with a friend. We were actually greeted by the owner, she's really nice and asked us if this was out first time in. She gave us some brief history on the place, it's been around for a long time. Fun fact, you can actually see a glimpse of this place in the movie psycho, in the background of a scene.   I've been back most of the times alone in a Saturday morning for a quick breakfast and coffee. The food is amazing, the prices are GREAT, and the service is ALWAYS friendly and prompt.   Place can get filled up but I've never really seen a line and personally I've never had a problem grabbing a seat.   Please support local and give this great business and great employees a chance."}
{"text":"Went here in a group. I got the turkey club sandwich. It was good while the french fries were hot but nothing special. Others got breakfast.   Service was good and all the food came out together.   Overall real good place to go to for lunch or breakfast with average prices."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, Great food. Good selection of homestyle meals. Lots of parking out back."}
{"text":"Talk about huge portions, sheesh! I felt like I was in Texas again. I meanedered over here from my CouchSurfing place and had a huge plate of french toast with a huge plate of scrambled eggs and hash browns. All of it was good and I think the hash browns is probably the best I've had in several states---been on a roadtrip for the last 3 weeks, so yeah I can make that statement.  And yes, the cops do frequent here so if you're carrying a dime-bag or worst---smell like you're carrying a dime bag, maybe not a place you should go to."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite some time now. On weekends the place is usually busy and their is a wait. But as of late, it hasn't been as packed on the weekends. I did notice they raised prices on the menu so I'm not sure if they raised prices to make up for lack of customers or if it's not as busy because of the raised prices. Food is still very good and portion sizes have remained the same. But if your breakfast comes with toast and you want Raisin toast, it's $1 more than regular toast now. Service is still good and prompt even when busy too. The price increase hasn't really deterred the regulars and it's nothing too outrageous but something's are noticeable like with the toast. They used to a have a loyalty punch card that if you got 10 punches, your next meal was free. So maybe they should bring that back to accommodate for the price change. Overall food is still good and service is still good. I will still come back even though prices have changed."}
{"text":"As long as you don't expect high-level customer service, this is a great place to eat just about every day of the week.  Really good food that usually is served very quickly - I live nearby and come here all the time.  They also started a new \"wing\" of the restaurant that's open at night.  Live music, outstanding service and good food at low prices - you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Tried to have breakfast here...stood at the door for 5 minutes while 3 people walked by and never acknowledged us one.  We walked out.  Cross this one off the list."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch! Will definitely come back when I am in the area. The small waffle is a regular waffle & when I asked what the large is, I was told a double waffle! Great customer service - even the owner came over to visit with us!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. The owner and wait staff are very friendly. I tend to order the same thing the last few visit the veggie cowboy, but have tried lots of there food. It is busy on sat and sun but they are quick to get you seated!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far but I'm sure to go back. If you're looking for simple, inexpensive, greasy spoon diner breakfast this is the place. The food was good and the prices made my wallet happy. The service was terrific, everyone was super pleasant. Over-all I was pleased and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"How much do I love breakfast at the 5th Ave Cafe?  A ton.  This is my new favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  I used to try to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but honestly it isn't worth a two or greater hour wait for bacon and eggs.    First of all, 5th Avenue Cafe has plenty of seating.  Their meals are good.  Their portions on the gigantor side which can be a good or bad thing.  Just realize that when you are ordering.    their Huevos are probably the best around.    A superlative choice if you want a breakfast that is scrummers!"}
{"text":"I love this family owned gem. The service is great and the owner is just the best. She always makes it a point to stop by our table.   The food is pretty good. As a healthier eater I really have to customize my order to get what I want, but the service and welcoming atmosphere is worth it.   One of my other favorite aspects of this place is that they have a kids menu!!! It's really difficult to find a place in midtown that either has a kids menu or a good enough a la cart menu for a child."}
{"text":"went back this past sunday.  the red potatoes are a lot better than the hash browns.   because it was a sunday, it was pretty packed and service wasn't as good as i would of hoped. but i liked the food better this time! definitely going to return."}
{"text":"Had the Cowboy Breakfast scramble, delicious. I'm in Phoenix every 6 weeks for work and I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Chorizo Cowbow is scrambled together in a skillet - 3 eggs, hash browns, mushrooms, tomato, onion, green pepper and spinach; served with toast or tortilla. This alone is a reason to check out this place!   My good friend Anthony turned me on to this place and if you are looking for a great meal hangover or no hangover this is the place to go. I prefer to sit at the bar because it's usually quicker seating.   If you go on the weekend be prepared for a possible wait as this place is very popular to families, and locals. One thing I love is that you get a true cross-section of all walks of life in this place. The staff is friendly and attentive while being efficient.   You are also supporting a local business when dining here and that's a perk in itself!"}
{"text":"My office is now with in walking distance, but we have been going here since it was Dee's. We being a couple of guys and I. So today Bruce said; lets go to lunch, I say, ok. He then says; I know anywhere except 5Th ave. The boy knows me so well ;-[) I tell him no I will go today, it has been a while since I have given in and gone with the masses. I just do not like the place. So we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress. This place always has nice wait people. She talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order.  Oh the food, the food. I order a french dip with Cole slaw and a side of onion rings. Bruce has his usual a BLT with well done bacon and fries. Now mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food. Which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food. What I get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain. Now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly, piled nicely on the bun. It should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus. I mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain, always. The bun on which it sat was just that, a meat seat. I also love Cole slaw and usually will eat what is served, not this. Totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour. The rings looked good, but looks can be deceiving. So Bruce you are right, any place but 5Th ave."}
{"text":"Solid little breakfast joint.   I have been here 3 times and my experiences have been pleasant. Food is good but nothing to go crazy over. Service is above average. I believe they have unlimited coffee refills too.   Pros - Good food - Fast service  Cons - Smaller portions - Boring menu"}
{"text":"5th Ave Cafe is usually where I go to for a great -better than home- breakfast...and I love it...but this weekend we went there to celebrate my hubby's birthday...for lunch! IT WAS AWESOME! WE had 12 people and - can I say- that usually a large party would have to wait because the kitchen couldn't handle such a large order at once BUT NOT at 5th Ave Cafe. Our food was out so fast, it was unexpected. Dawn was so kind, she insisted that I enjoy my hubby's birthday and she even took pictures and cut & served the cake. The food was excellent, the servers are awesome and I couldn't have asked for a better place. From the bus peeps to the servers to the chefs/cooks to the owners- THE BEST PLACE EVER! They cater too...we will always make time to go to 5th Ave Cafe for breakfast & lunch (killer Patty Melt, BTW) but NOW, we have a place to celebrate birthdays, Anniversary's  and really any occasion where we want to have great food and enjoy the time. THANK YOU 5th Ave Cafe!! OH- just a side note...a few week ago I ordered the sausage & eggs - I didn't eat the sausage...when they picked up my plate the owner found his way over to our table and asked if there was something wrong. I was surprised  because I didn't know what he was talking about. He went on to say that he noticed I didn't eat the sausage and wanted to know if I was unhappy. I told him, no, it was fine, I just don't like the casings. He sad, no problem to let them know and they'll remove the casings....I was impressed! These people really want to make you happy.. try it- you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch with a co-worker. It's open seating and we grabbed a booth and placed our order. He had a side salad and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. I had the roasted turkey sandwich which is turkey, bacon, spinach on sourdough with fries and a pickle on the side. The sandwich was a little greasy but delicious and the fries were crisp and delicious. My coworker enjoyed his soup so much he ordered a second cup.   The staff was pleasant enough. A little slow at times but nothing to get upset about. The prices are fair. I am definitely going to go back and try their breakfast.  I finally made it back here for breakfast and I am glad I did. I had the ham and cheese omelette which came with big chucks of ham and lots of cheese. It was delicious! It also had a side of hash browns and an English muffin.   The service is fast and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I have gone back several times. Service has always been amazing, food delicious and great prices. So as I mentioned the first time I went there, the service was explainable and not representative of them.  Just an insanely busy day. Loyal customer here!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a classic burger, the meat was dry and had no flavor even after I added salt and pepper. I had to ask for my fries to be cooked more because they were so underdone. My side salad was descent as well the onion rings which were the typical frozen onion rings. Definitely won't come back here."}
{"text":"My team at work decided to take our meeting offsite today and enjoy a delicious breakfast in the process...and you guys definitely delivered!  Our group of 8 was seated quickly and we had our coffee and water lickity-split!   From the person who seated us to our waiter we were super happy with your service. The menu had an option for every one .... and the coffee was so so good and thank you for constantly keeping my cup full!  If you're looking for a traditional American breakfast that doesn't taste like it's from a conveyor belt, you have found your place! I ordered the biscuits and gravy (which came with eggs and bacon) which was super good, I also had a nibble of my co-worker's chicken fried steak and another's pancake ... All were worth ordering. The gravy was good, not too peppery.  Their lunch menu looked tasty so I have a feeling a few of us will be back for a burger in the near future.    //cheers//"}
{"text":"I often meet a friend here for lunch as the food is decent, the prices are reasonable and the staff friendly. I'm a fan of their tuna melt especially."}
{"text":"Clean, nice staff, decent menu.  They have daily specials and a good deal of parking behind the building, which is rare along Thomas.  They got us in and out fairly quickly, and the food was fresh and made the way you would expect.    Nothing extraordinary, but a solid diner nonetheless."}
{"text":"Today I realized I hadn't updated my review for Fifth Avenue Cafe in 5 years. New owners have bought it in the interim. They regularly do different experiments for specials which have been great 100% of the time I've ordered them. The lunches have improved since they have taken over. The service is VERY good. Very friendly servers and owners. You can tell that everyone there is treated well."}
{"text":"What happened?   We came today (on my birthday) for breakfast. There were several vacant booths. We sat down because we have never had to wait to be seated by staff before.  Pretty much instantly, the owner said there's a sign in sheet and told us we couldn't sit there.  Since there wasn't a sign in sheet to sit at the counter, we sat there. We got coffee and water and then nothing.  No one to take our order. My husband asked the owner lady about taking our order she refused saying that someone would be by after he finished doing whatever he was doing.  We left.    This place used to be good and nice to customers. Maybe they are too successful now to care."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Its amazing the prices for what you get. So many times I go to other restaurants to eat breakfast and I end up paying $20 bucks on average. I spend less than half here. Food is good, staff is friendly. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is becuase I like to have some nice drink specials on my sunday, such as mimosas and bloody marys and this place doesnt have that."}
{"text":"They had the BEST vanilla latte I've ever had! Breakfast was yummy and service was friendly. A hole in the wall joint worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Small town diner feel w amazing food. Love the staff. Everything is special and if they have crepes as a special order them!!!  Patty melt is best I have found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  You never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you.  The service can be slow at times which can get annoying.  The space is pretty big, bigger than what it seems from the street.  The food was so-so."}
{"text":"the service and ambiance of this diner are a#1 the crowd are bikers to old folks ,hipsters and many other walks of life great mix of people only 1 thing the food is not that good my eggs bene had a weird sauce my wife thinks it had mustard in it and her omlett was way over cooked which made the eggs dry  and chewy. we will try again because i really want this to be my goto breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Solid diner style breakfast place. The food is nothing special, but it's always up to par. The price is reasonable as well, and they always seem relatively clean."}
{"text":"We walked in and no one greeted us for at least 10 minutes of standing their awkwardly.  I had 2/2 pancake & egg (scrambled) w/sausage patti. Husband had same (over easy) w/hashbrowns.  Sausage patties were too salty, pancakes were ok but a little overlooked on one side making me work to cut into them. Eggs were great.  If the service was better we may have given a better rating."}
{"text":"Coffee was really good.  Service could have been a bit better.  Food was prompt and tasty.  I would absolutely come back.  The menu had a variety for breakfast and I want to try for lunch."}
{"text":"Helpful, caring and attentive staff. Deals with problems in a cheerful and positive attitude. Quality of offerings is consistent with no unpleasant surprises. The owner is everywhere checking with customers and ensuring that the experience is top-notch.  I am there virtually every Saturday and have never left unsatisfied with the food and the staff. Oh, and the breakfast prices are some of the lowest in town."}
{"text":"Just checked out this restaurant for the first time and, OMG, Fabulous! The place was very busy, which to me, usually means the food is really good. We were greeted by the owner, Dawn, who is quite the delight. We waited no longer than 10 minutes before we got sat. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Our drinks were always full and I could see that pretty much everybody elses drinks were full as well.   We had the breakfast (I had the Mediterranean Omelet, my husband had the Green chili omelet) and we were both thoroughly impressed. The food was delicious! I would certainly recommend 5th Ave Cafe to anybody interested in a tasty breakfast.   I have not tried the lunch yet, but their lunch menu looks great. I will definitely be back to check out their lunch and have their breakfast again.   Great staff, very inviting, wonderful food!"}
{"text":"This place is CRAP!!!!! Your seriously better off going to Dennys or IHOP. Me and my grandma thought we would stop and have breakfast which turned out to be a disaster. My food was covered in an ocean of grease and oil, the coffee taste 3 days old and when I tried to ask the waitress for a side of fruit instead of my greasy heart attack hash browns she gathered with all her colleagues and talk about us like dogs (Pointing and staring). Don't let longevity fool you. The food is terrible and service is worse. Your better off going to the grocery store and making your own breakfast. Seriously don't know how this place is open and with an 4 star ratings. WOW!"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was great, but the food was just greasy and lacking flavor. I got the chicken fried chicken and the gravy was watery and the breading was soggy. The hash browns left the roof of my mouth greasy for half an hour after we left. I want to think that it was just an off day an d I'll try it again because the service was fast and nice and the location is perfect for us."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant for the first time today, and I absolutely loved it! It's a nice down home restaurant, with great food, and even better prices. The owner is extremely nice, and mingles with the patrons. All the waitstaff were friendly and attentive. It's a breath of fresh air from the normal overrated restaurants of today. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service!! The eggs benedict are the best! Great coffee and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Clean, comfortable atmosphere; exceptional (and affordable), cheery service; great great great breakfast food.  I'm a huge breakfast person. I could literally eat it at every meal, but there are 4 reasons I prefer to keep coming back down to 5th Avenue Cafe.  1) Atmosphere. It's the little things that make a restaurant great, and this place has them all. It's clean, colorful, well-lit, and the servers seem believably happy.   2) Great food. No, it isn't five star (but then you're not paying 5-star prices are you?). No it isn't arranged on the place like a piece of art - but with breakfast food, the \"proof is in the pudding.\" And it's never disappointed me as far as taste or quality are concerned.  3) The people. The patrons of 5th Avenue Cafe are among the \"salt of the earth\" category. They're accepting, approachable, warm, easygoing, and unassuming - as are all of the staff. This makes it a place both worth visiting AND coming back to. 4) Her.  There is one waitress there that has a smile that will melt your heart. This goes back to what I said about the staff being believably cheery. She's a truly happy person, which is all but rare most places I find myself - the kind of person that radiates it out. All the servers are kind and cheery, she's just a little more-so.  She serves near the front (Thomas-side) of the restaurant. Sit up there - she'll treat you nice, and enjoy your breakfast at the 5th Avenue Cafe."}
{"text":"We very recently found this place, but ate breakfast here this morning for the third weekend in a row. It's a great little neighborhood cafe with a super friendly wait staff, and delicious food. We can't recommend it enough!!"}
{"text":"Located on south side of Thomas and 5th Av. Across from the hospital.  A not so typical cafe featuring typical, and not so typical cafe eats.  For instance Chile and a  Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  Or  Eggs Benedict, or Spinach Salad with red onions and bacon.  David Charns, the owner is friendly and conscious of quality food.  Open early for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You can feel well protected with our Boys in Blue frequenting the joint.  For intermittent entertainment, a one man band is sometimes featured on Friday evenings.  Cocktails available.  And if you're interested in checking out First Fridays Art Walk in downtown Phoenix, featured once a month - they're on the bus route.  Super casual atmosphere, good food served up quick with a little smak makes this place fetching.  Be sure to say \"Hi\" to the dishy blonde at the front door and check out the outfit of the day!"}
{"text":"1. The lay out inside is warm and welcoming. I do appreciate Mexican tile with black grout. Right when you enter, you are instantly greeted.  2. There is a variety of breakfast options, this place is known for their 'Cowboy' options and omelets. I got their Veggie 'Cowboy' skillet, it was not too greasy or too much food. The tortilla was delicious, would recommend getting the tortilla not the toast. 3. Coffee, solid.  4. Prices are very reasonable for all menu options. 5. Lastly and most importantly, Dawn rang my husband and I out at check-out and she was really nice. We were searching the candy basket for candy we like, and she pulls out a box full of candy for us to choose from. AND! She gave me all of the Strawberry candies she could find. Major win in my book!"}
{"text":"Honestly I've never heard of this place. I was in the area searching for a breakfast spot and this random little nugget appeared. It was a toss up between this place and The Good Egg. Needless to say 5th Avenue Cafe was the right choice.  Right from the get go my party and I noticed the amazing decor. It had a Memphis feel to it with alot of jazz themed nick nacks everywhere. There was some good music playing too. (Herby Hancock)   Waitress was pretty friendly and attentive. She told us that their skillet dishes were their main dishes. Unfortunately their waffle machine was down and they had to wait for some guy to come fix it. I thought that strange for some reason.  Their menu is large. Typical breakfast menu except everything was southwestern style! Also the prices were pretty cheap. We decided to share food. So we got their homemade pancake, French toast, Bacon omelette, biscuits and gravy, and spiced potatoes. All good. Allow me to describe each dish in detail!!  First those potatoes were.....perfect. Cooked just right. spiced just right. There was a slight crunch that was consistent throughout the dish which meant the chef knew what they were doing. They were the red potatoes too. The soft interior filled my taste buds with delight. Each bite made me think about life and how good it was.   Then there was the Bacon omelette. But that's to vague. It was actually the Bacon avoacoado perfectly seasoned tomato and sausage gravy omelette with a side of sour cream. (We added the gravy on ourselves). Was this heaven? I submit yes! How did they perfectly cook the Bacon and eggs together with the tomatoes so eligantly? Magic? However they did it, it worked. Each bite was satisfying. Delectable is the only word that comes to mind. The only thing that could have made it better was cheese. Oh wait a minute, there was cheese! Swiss cheese to be exact. Melted and aged just right.   My goodness the French toast was just simply not fair. Why? Because for now on if I want the best French toast in the world I have to go to 5th Avenue Cafe. Which means I have to drive downtown each and every time. But....its absolutely worth it. Soft yet crunchy goodness. Powdered sugar not overbearing. And once you top it with syrup, you melt. Read that again. The French toast stays crunchy somehow (again magic), but you yourself melt. After the first bite, I sat back in my seat and pondered the applications of modern miracles. Was I even allowed to take another bite of this......beautiful creation? How can I be? Who am I to say that I'm worthy enough to do so? Whatever I did anyways. And it was good.  Pancake was also pretty good. There was a nice slight buttery taste. And although not fluffy, it did melt in your mouth. It paired nicely with my cup of coffee. (Speaking of food pairing, I noticed a large beer selection. Next time I come in I will delve into my other passion).   We also got a side of Bacon just to sample it. Very good. The friend I was with described it as \"salty goodness.\" To me it was slightly over cooked but that's just a personal preference.  Overall perfect place. Also all that which I described which filled us up cost less than $20.00!!!!!! Another miracle? No just people who can make good food, and present reasonable prices due to skillfull accounting practices.  This place has become my spot. Sorry \"The Place\" but I like breakfast here better. But \"The Place\" does have a large beer selection as well including local beers on tap. So maybe their tied?   Ok bye."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The owner Dawn greeted us upon being seating and was very personal.  Large variety of breakfast and lunch options. We had the Hotel California crêpe, side of grits, and meat lovers burrito."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom!  So we were staying a few blocks from this place and decided to check it out. There were four of us and we were seated as soon as we walked in. After reviewing the menu we were greeted and our very friendly waitress took our order.  I had the Cowboy Breakfast skillet, someone had the Chorizo cowboy skillet and I cannot remember what the other two had.  My skillet was amazing and what a great idea to mix eggs, hash browns, ham, bacon, and cheese in a skillet and cook it. It was the perfect breakfast with all the needed components and with great flavors!  I know everyone else at the table was very happy with their meals as well and we wish we would have seen this place sooner."}
{"text":"Smells really bad inside of restaurant and food wasn't that good either. One star is plenty for them."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak I've ever had! Service was amazing and so cheap ! Would definitely go here again"}
{"text":"My mother lives out of state. So I crave Mom and Pop restaurants. Especially those for breakfast. Today at 5th Ave Cafe,  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with gravy,  extra soft eggs with pepperjack cheese and hashbrowns. It was totally delicious. In addition, the customer Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to meet a friend for lunch. Not the healthiest dishes but tasty. The booths are big and the noise level is minimal."}
{"text":"First impressions are most important right? Exploring the neighborhood, I'd already looked at the online menu. It took me a couple of turns before I eventually visited. Why? I'm not sure. Again....I work in the area and love to explore new places. When appropriate, I'll recommend a place to go.  I wandered in for lunch, and ordered take out. Prompt, friendly greeting.  Decided upon the patty melt and for a dollar more some O-rings.  WoW!!    Yum!   Literally one of the best Patty Melts I've had. EVER!! And the Rings!! Yum!! The Rye was grilled perfectly. The onions were nice and crisp, sweet and perfectly cooked, melty cheese and a perfectly cooked medium well burger. Juicy and nicely charred. The onion rings were panko crusted I believe but tender on the inside, minced sweet onion and oh so good.  An eclectic place, it was a diner with a modern vibe. I struck up a conversation with some 'regulars' while I was waiting. They were very charming. The server and counter staff were very friendly.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here as long as I can remember.  The food is much better than any of those chain restaurants, and the servers always go the extra mile for you, even when they're slammed.  The owners are almost always out on the floor working, cleaning, expediting, giving refills, or giving smiles :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place, love the atmosphere. Makes me feel like I live in a small, warm town when I'm in here. The food is so good and the staff are so hospitable. We had the French toast and I forgot to take a picture before we devoured it ."}
{"text":"I  breakfast! When food is made with love you can taste it!!! This place is LOCAL and full of love, and friendliness....the owner is first to demonstrate that to her customers! This is Year Two for us here in Phoenix, and as long as we live here we will support this restaurant, and it's great people who make delicious food!"}
{"text":"The breakfeast is ok and not bad for the price not bad but I wouldn't mind paying a few more dollars for some quality their maple syrup says chefs quality on it but it's made out of deadly fructose corn syrup and then they served me my food to go in styrofoam and the the oil from the food just melted the whole plastic styrofoam into my food this is unacceptable for such a busy place you'd think the owner would have the integrity to accommodate people properly! Very angry!"}
{"text":"Breakfast options in the central corridor are alarmingly sparse, which creates irrational decisions like visiting 5th Avenue Cafe to percolate in your brain, brewing as a 'good idea'.  It is not.  What seems like would be a local Denny's knock off except with mahogany trim and a full bar was more like a Mel's Diner without the boorish, but hilarious short-order cook and a tad dirtier.  My fiancee's veggie breakfast was frightful and dry while my I found myself surrendering to the French toast offensive.  No amount of store-bought syrup could conquer that alpine mountain of suck.  Somehow, i don't think this is what France had in mind when they lent the moniker to breakfast heaven.  They need to rename them Freedom Toast, as in, set these things free in the front asphalt parking lot so the hospital pigeons can feast.  The ambiance is absolutely laughable at best.  In every available sight line are TV [one was one of those old-school rear projector behemoths on a ledge] set to CNN just in case you want to know the weather in Duluth as you fight your chewy bacon.  Coincidentally, there is the hospital across the street, convenient for an outpatient stomach pump should the need present itself."}
{"text":"The food is good..but the customer service is real poor, service with attitude, slam drink and menu on the table with out a word of apologize...would not recommended"}
{"text":"We were on our way to First Watch when suddenly the Yelp app started ringing and displayed an offer/freebie to 5th Avenue Cafe, perfect way to try a new place right?  We checked in as required by the offer.  The place was overwhelmed by customers waiting.  Manager said it was due to a Marathon.  When I inquired to the server about the Yelp offer she was completely unaware of it; I tried displaying the Yelp offer but it was nowhere to be found.  Anyhow we where there and hungry so we ordered.  The food was ok.  Great wheat bread, my hasbrowns ordered crispy were not.  Later the manager came over and I mentioned how we got to the place and she gave me a high five (a hands high five) this was the name of the special that lured us inside.  I honestly thought it was like a muffing or a special coffe deal LOL.  There you have it folks, come get your high five and have a great day!"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying breakfast & lunch at 5th Ave Cafe for years, they never disappoint. I am a fan, I will say that outright but I had to take time to write a review because in all the years I've been frequenting 5 Ave Cafe, I have never had this happen. Yesterday, (Friday), I saw an email that was sent about the weekend specials. Chilaquiles Egg Bake w/ Hash Browns. CHILAQUILES??!! I LOVE CHILAQUILES! I dreamt about the chilaquiles. SERIOUSLY. The first thing I said to my husband this morning was: \"let's go to 5th Ave Cafe, they have chilaquiles as the special.\" He knows that I've been on a quest to find the perfect chilaquiles. Whenever I see a place that makes them, I make a point to go try them. Most places are  'just okay', some are decent, very few are great. After all, Nobody makes chilaquiles like my mama used to make! I loved them! I encourage you to check them out!  They were great, they were even better than my mama's - but don't tell her."}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef hash and the amount of corned beef I was given was an embarrassment. The meal should be titled overly buttered hash browns bc that's what 95% of my meal was. I don't know how this place has such a high rating. I've never been more disappointed with a breakfast in my life. The whole meal was soggy and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I've just discovered one of the best breakfast restaurants in the Valley. Growing up with a truck driver father who loved his corn beef hash nicely browned with his sunnyside up eggs, I learned early in life that breakfast is the most important meal in a working man's day. Earl White runs a top notch operation that rates five star from this ex-restaurateur any day of the week."}
{"text":"Cute diner atmosphere for breakfast. Ordered the Fiesta Omelette. Veggies very fresh got corn tortilla as a GF option to toast. Hash browns were awful. Wish I had a Bounty paper towel to soak up the grease and a cast iron pan to finish cooking them. Diner was hopping so it appears to be a favorite. I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're very hungry, this place has huge breakfasts. But I wouldn't say the breakfast is much above average. Asked for crispy hash browns, didn't get them....husband's food came out cold. Of course he never says anything because he's too nice..guh.  But you could share a breakfast and it would be enough. Noticed some other people's food..the BLT looked good, I'm gonna try that next time. Nice neighborbood atmosphere, and very nice wait staff."}
{"text":"The pulled pork special was 5 star worthy.  The flavor and texture were stupendous.   Service was prompt and efficient.   This was a great place for lunch.  Had a business meeting, which the environment supported.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Super duper mom and pop breakfast spot. The owner tends to walk around the restaurant ensuring her patrons are completely satisfied with the service and food.  Servers are quick to respond to any requests. The food specials are wonderful. I have never had a bad experience. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a more local, family owned IHOP.    The perfect scenario: you had too much to drink the other night, you roll out of bed with a hangover, your stomach is growling, and you want to go somewhere where you can be in your pj's practically and no one will notice or care, head to 5th Avenue Cafe.    The not so perfect scenario:  Roll out of bed, put on makeup, fix my hair, put on some shorts, cute shirt, high heels - and I am ready to eat some good breakfast at a \"cool, trendy\" spot.  A few restaurants come to mind:  Matt's Big Breakfast or Snooze. .  But....I want to go somewhere new.  So I check yelp and I find 5th ave cafe.   I ordered the corned beef hash and honestly, I really had no complaints.  The service was mediocre.  No one really checked up on us.  Then I look around and we are kind of the trendy duo in this restaurant.  No one was checking the news or checking the internet on their phone.  No one was dressed the way we were dressed.  I kinda felt a little lost and honestly, overdressed.  I then thought maybe I can make myself feel like I belong again by heading to Lux for an almond milk vanilla latte, but I decided to just head home.  When I got home, the p.j.'s went back on and then I felt whole again."}
{"text":"If you like good prices, this is the place for you. I tried the veggie cowboy as recommend, but was not impressed. There wasn't really any flavor.  Still, I probably will go back because of the prices. Despite my less than awesome experience they're very busy. There was a queue to be seated at a table. My friend and I just sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I do like this cafe. I enjoy coming here for a good breakfast and at least once a week my job will order lunch from here. I have always had good food, but I have to say there is one waitress inparticular that is just lousy! It's as if she doesn't care about her job, the customers or getting a tip.  I've had the displeasure of having her as a waitress twice and next time I go in there for breakfast I know very well not to sit in her section.   This past Saturday it took at least 10 minutes to get menus, another 10 for drinks and when she brought our food that was the last time we saw her. She never came back to check on us or give us refills.   I reference this same waitress in my other review, so clearly since July her attitude hasn't changed.   There are other really friendly and helpful waitress and bus boys that work at this cafe and they all work really hard make an effort to ensure you have a good visit, but this one waitress could give a crap and it really shows.  I hate to not tip servers because I know that is part of how they make a living, but if the service and the attitude is going to be so apathetic, then you don't get a tip from me!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for several years now.  Most consistently good food for breakfast in downtown.  Specials on Saturdays.  Try my namesake the \"MIACH\" for breakfast special if offered.  It is a buttery croissant with scrambled eggs, bacon and Swiss and hash browns, to perfection, on the side.  YUMMY!!!!!  And I want to give a shout out to the servers that are great!! Paula, Krista, Zeus, Balthazar and our favorite, Dawn!"}
{"text":"Peggy and I decided to try this wonderful place in the middle of a great Sunday morning trifecta which involved incredible sales at nearby Southwest Gardener and Aaron Brothers.  Gabby was our server, and she was very welcoming and brought one of the basic food groups (coffee) to us almost immediately upon request. I had the Cowboy breakfast ((hash browns were extra crispy as I wanted) and Peggy got the cheese omelette complete with hash browns also crispy as ordered.  Earl was nearby and was a joy to meet.  He was very cordial and he felt like (welcomed!) family from the get-go.  This will definitely be on our list of go-backs when we are around the area...and likely even if we make the drive from NE Scottsdale. Once again, a small place which emphasizes on great food and customer service.  Sorry to miss out on the danish which I saw from a previous blogger was \"the best in town!\"  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was very enjoyable. The staff was pleasant and attentive, the food was good, and the coffee was decent. I ordered the Veggie Cowboy Skillet and it made me happy. They didn't skimp on the veggies and it didn't feel heavy with grease. Let's not forget the wheat toast. It had whole oats and flax in it. Yea! Annnnnd it's all very reasonably priced. Breakfast for two with coffee was under $20.  The atmosphere here has a bit of an old time feel. It's cozy, very clean, and well maintained. 5 stars. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a nicely hidden gem. Me and the son went there for some breakfast before his BJJ tourney. We were warmly welcomed and sat ourselves at the bar. He had the biscuits and gravy meal and I had the corned beef hash meal. Everything came as we liked. Food was great and was the right amount. The hostess?/owner?/manager? lady was a warm smile as well as graciously welcoming. The other staff was also friendly and great.   I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the food. It's better than you'd expect and the right amount of food. I admit I was skeptical when I saw my plate. But after finishing it I realized it was legitimately the perfect amount. Son didn't finish his but I did warn him before he ordered the biscuits n gravy MEAL. He cleared the biscuits and gravy (the best part) and most of the bacon, eggs and hash browns that were left.   Overall this place was great. If I am ever in the area I will absolutely come here again. Heck, I may make a weekend trip just for kicks! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The menu has a lot of potential but the breakfast isn't that great.. Eggs are overcooked, pancakes are tough to eat, and the butter was nearly frozen."}
{"text":"Will never go back. The most depressing place on earth. They have nursing and funeral home advertisements on the table. Decor and ambience just killed it for me. Food was bland and not exciting. Couldn't wait to get out."}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs again, it did not disappoint. My youngest ordered the kids silver dollar pancake breakfast. It was enormous. His hot chocolate was large with whipped cream piled nice and high. Their lunch menu looks excellent as well, so I plan on trying that soon as well. We have always had excellent and attentive service here. They have plenty of parking in the back. It's right across from St. Joes, so this is greatly convenient for us."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for breakfast. I love it! The wait staff was prompt and friendly. The food arrived quickly and was delicious. The restaurant is clean and inviting. I liked everything about it and I will definitely be back when I'm in the downtown area."}
{"text":"For your basic breakfast, this place is great.  The prices are so cheap, you get a very large amount of food, and the food was really good for what we ordered.  No fancy breakfast options (benedict, etc) but delicious basic breakfast.  Service was great and we were seated right away.  I love the diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"My son and I came in for breakfast.  Our first visit definitely won't be our last.  Food was great!  Son had Pumpkin waffle and I had the Mediterranean Omelet.  Both were great!  Can't wait to bring my wife"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and clientele.  This is where the charismatic come for breakfast.  The cowboy scramble is filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Kitchen seems to really hold up speed of service.  Additionaly, service staff seem overwhelmed by a normal busy breakfast shift. Late giving menus,  slow to ask for your drink order etc.  The food is of good quality. Menu is as expected for a corner diner. But dang, the service is off putting!"}
{"text":"I have been here a coupe of times and always remember too late that they have no Wi-Fi and nothing on the tv. No sriracha, just Tabasco, cholula and tapatio. Apparently they \"can't\" make a half sandwich? Really good potatoes though."}
{"text":"Tried this cafe on a whim & it was delicious. Service was quick and friendly. This cafe had a neighborly vibe to it. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place; always accommodating, and they remember their regulars, which is nice..even when I haven't been for awhile!"}
{"text":"Came here when I was super duper sick, so I tried to get in and out real quick -- I got a lot of assistance from various people at the bar when I was getting my to go order. I'll make sure to check back when I get a chance to sit down and eat here -- My \"coyboy scramble\" was really tasty, and the coffee was okay. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in I felt the love, man, I felt the love. This cute old lady waved at me and we found our seats. The service was fast and the food was good. The servers are soooo nice and if you check in you get a FREE HIGH FIVE! Hahaha"}
{"text":"Had the morning glory omelette. Too many raw veggies. Kinda hard to eat an omelette crunching thru onions."}
{"text":"Delicious inexpensive food. I was in the neighborhood and was looking at a brunch place to eat. I found this and I will be coming back! Delicious, Tasty, cheap dining."}
{"text":"The perfect breakfast diner!  God I love this place.  Big portions of GREAT breakfast food in a CLASSIC diner setting.  The hasbrowns were greasy and awesome, pancakes and scrambled eggs were done PERFECTLY!    They have a bar and booth seating as well, and the place was filled with the sounds of the sizzling grill.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"I went to 5th Avenue Cafe today ready to have some brunch (well breakfast food really). I absolutely love breakfast. Aside from ice cream, it's my favorite.   The atmosphere was okay. We were at a huge table off to the side due to the large number of people in our party. I quickly noticed that the fans in the building did not cover the one half of our table. We had to fan ourselves with items we could find at the table. We were asked if we wanted separate checks, which was a nice bonus with a large table.  I ended up ordering an omelet, hash browns, and rye toast. The hash browns and the omelet were a little drier than I would've hoped for. I don't like greasetastrophes, but I do like a little flavor. It was, however, a large portion of food, and I ended up only being able to finish half of it.  It wasn't bad to the point that I won't ever go back again, but I'm not sure it will be on my list of places to visit in a hurry."}
{"text":"I just have to say that the owner of this place definitely knows how to run a restaurant and how to take care of customers! She treats everyone there like she's known them for years!   I've been here a couple times and every time it has been quite good until today. Today, she came around to ask if everything was okay and I told her with some hesitation that my meal wasn't so great. She was so kind and remedied the entire situation for me. She told me she valued what I said and was going to make sure she fixed the problem for next time.   This is truly a neighborhood restaurant. I love that I can walk here from home and get such wonderful food and service. Yes, they are really busy on the weekends but the servers are clearly working SO hard to do everything they can to take care of diners!   Even though today wasn't the best meal, I still think this place deserves 5 stars because they take such great pride in making sure everything is done right and they take each customers opinion to heart.   I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is always busy and deservingly so.  The food is delicious, the service is great,  and they have very reasonable prices! I've tried most of their breakfast foods and even their sandwiches,  soups,  and pasta and everything has always been delicious. The place is never dirty or unkempt. I have a very fussy 2 year old and the same nice lady now recognizes us when we come in and gives him crackers to keep him busy until our food comes,  which is never a long time. This will remain one of our favorite IHOP alternatives since we love supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"5th Ave is my favorite breakfast place in the downtown/central Phoenix area. The place is always full but I've never had to wait to be seated. Great service with a cozy, cafe ambiance."}
{"text":"We found this place close to our Airbnb house and decided to give it a try.  It is across the street from a hospital so I was a little skeptic. Outside looks like a pretty normal restaurant, but once we walked inside I realized we had made the right choice. It is darker inside and have the feeling of an old town diner where locals can grab a quick bite or linger for drinks and laughs. We were greeted quickly and were immediately served with drinks. My companions chose a BLT and the other wanted the Philly Steak.  I chose the special which was a Southwest spicy pasta. All portions were generous meaning two people could share. The only reason I gave one less star is because my pasta was a little limp, but the sauce put the bravo on the dish. Don't forget to get the Yelp High Five when you check in. This delicious lunch gave us enough energy to climb South Mountain."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere.  The cafe seems to have two personalities: one side felt like a diner, and the other was a little more inviting (booths).  Felt like a regular even though it was my first visit (months ago).  Ordered the strawberries 'n creme crepe sans powdered sugar... very good!  Wouldn't mind coming back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place does basic food well. Big portions.  There is a good variety of food. Very well priced. Many breakfast items for under 8.00. I had the Cowboy scramble. The pancakes my son had look really good.will be back. 3.5 stars is what I rate my meal at this time."}
{"text":"I liked this place as soon as we walked in. It was homey and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. We had brunch and the food came out quickly, was fresh and delicious. The pancakes were a must and the coffee was good as well. The prices are welcome compared to most of the lunch places I frequent in the area. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Dawn is such a sweetheart!  I walked in, plopped down at the bar and she looked at me. \"Coffee. You need coffee!\" I don't know if it was love at first sight, but she gets me!  Anthony later stopped by and introduced himself with a handshake and glass of water.  These people know how to make you feel welcome!  I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. I was very happy! Everything was delicious and I left full, recharged and stoked that I got to enjoy a breakfast that made me feel like I had been a regular for years."}
{"text":"First off, this is a Diner, not a cafe. Second, im not sure how this gets an average of 4 stars on yelp..  Went in, dark and dingy, which I never hold against a place, sometimes theyre the best plces to eat, but that did not apply here.   Sat at the counter, had a nice waitress, while the other two did not seem like they wanted to be there at all or didnt know what they were doing.   Ordered bacon and swiss omelette with hash browns and wheat toast. Omlette: subpar. Bacon wasnt cooked enough, nor was there really much in there, same with the cheese, not cheesy at all. Cooked fine though. The hash browns were cooked in enough butter, but learn to season with salt and pepper.  One of the most basic things as a cook is to season your food.    Look, this place isn't worth stopping at for food."}
{"text":"This is the best place in town for comfort food and comfort atmosphere.  The owners, Dawn and Earl are the best.  You are welcomed like you have gone to their home.  The servers are super friendly and want to make sure you are well taken care.  Its like going to a friends house.  The food is very good.  It is not a gourmet dining experience.  Its not meant to be.  What its meant to be is well prepared comfort food, good service and a friendly welcoming attitude.  It totally succeeds.  My eggs are always perfectly cooked, my hash nice and crispy and they always crisp my hash browns perfectly for me.  Their hamburgers are really good.  I particularly like their BLT.  Its loaded with bacon and the tomatoes are always ripe and juicy.  Their rotating lunch dishes are just like mama made. Their Saturday and Sunday brunch specials are very good.  The prices are reasonable and compare very well with other places in the area. To make a long story short I love the place and go there every chance I get."}
{"text":"Here from California for spring training and found this great cafe thanks to yelp! Very afforable breakfast , great food and great customer service.    We called last min for a party of 8 and they were able to accommodate. Really recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda pissed no-one told me about this place earlier...   yeah its a dive, no... its not purrrrrdy... but wow... nice breakfast for 2 under $13.00!. Being from the east coast, I know you can't judge a book by its cover... so no judgements were made walking in... Honestly ... outside of the Roscoe's Baseball team... the patrons nor the restaurant has changed in 30+ years.. ( clothing or fixtures )   The service was pleasant, and decent... large classic plastic glasses that hold the beverages are a good value and no need to ever ask for a refill.   I had a typical breakfast.. eggs over, hash browns, link sausage and wheat toast. All arrived hot and flavorful... the sausage, regardless of ingredients... was the best I've ever had in Arizona... I will be back just for them!!   I noticed a full bar, and although I didn't ask, I can imagine that I could come here for a raging drink fest and not pay much... I hope that at night the bartender is an old, surly woman slamming the drinks down for me... that would make it picture perfect!"}
{"text":"It's very cheap and delicious! It's very hidden and windows are tinted, it's hard to tell if it's open. I found it on Google Maps for searching for breakfast. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Lovely historic neighborhood breakfast joint. Really friendly staff, quick service, inexpensive, classic diner. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Long story short: pretty darn good place for breakfast with bold Southwestern flavors.  Long story long:  After checking out of our hotel in Phoenix, we had arranged to have breakfast with a friend of mine whom I know via Twitter.  She had gotten off work pretty late the night prior, otherwise we probably would have hung out then, so we opted for breakfast.  I had seen this place and a couple of other ones, and cross referenced her suggestions.  I was leaning toward this place because it was relatively near the 17 going up to Flagstaff, since I wanted to get on the road as soon as possible because we had a long day of driving ahead of us.  I almost drove right by this place.  Not that its impossible to find, I just almost missed it like that.  Walking in, my friend was already waiting for us in a booth.  The place definitely has a little bit of a Southwest feel to it.  Pretty spacious with plenty of seating and it smelled good, which is always a good sign.  Looking at their menu, they had a lot of your typical breakfast cafe type of dishes, but quite a few of them with a Southwest flair.  I eventually decided on the Chorizo Cowboy, a scramble with chorizo, hash browns, and cheddar cheese.  Served with a side of salsa and toast.  I got an orange juice to drink.  Our food came out and it looked and smelled good.  How can you go wrong with chorizo?  And eggs?  And hash browns?  And cheese?  You just can't.  Don't argue with.. nop.. shush!!!  I put some salsa on it and dug in.  Talk about good flavor.  Everything worked well with each other.  I could taste the spices from the chorizo and it was all good.  I will say though there was a tiny bit of a grease puddle on the bottom when I was done, but hey, fat is flavor, hahaha.  Still good though.  We left full, but not stuffed, and satisfied.  Prices were reasonable as well.  I would definitely come back here should I ever find myself in Phoenix.  Hey, you never know ;)"}
{"text":"My cousin suggested we meet at this place for lunch since I was driving from Tucson to LA. I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and half of it was just toast and a tomato slice. Essentially I paid $5.45 for toast and fries. Bonus star because it was cheap."}
{"text":"My dad and I stop in for breakfast this morning.  I loved all the musical instruments hanging on the wall and the pictures.  Also enjoyed seeing so many locals and many 90 plus year olds.  We sat ourselves and were greeted immediately by the one and only waitress, Paula.  The place was packed.  They have hot green tea and the food was better than Matt's Big Breakfast.  They have an awesome wood counter and wooden chairs plus the tables with the booths have been finished nicely.  My dad had the veggie cowboy with rye toast and instead of potatoes a side of fruit and we were not charged for the substitution.  I elected to have the pancakes and two eggs as I am searching AZ for the best pancakes.  These were okay nothing to rave about but the fact they were better than Matts big breakfast.  When eating pancakes, if I can cut them with just my fork and they taste good with just butter they are great.  These needed to be cut with a knife and they were on a little bit dry.  Great service and great decor.  If we lived closer we would come again."}
{"text":"5th Avenue Cafe is a wonderful neighborhood friendly Cafe. I walk to this location and enjoy the coffee and entree for breakfast. I've never eaten lunch here.  The menu is classic diner, whether it be chicken fried steak, egg sandwiches, corn beef and hash. Egg white Greek omelet and etc, they always come thru with expectations.   The staff is super friendly and on top of the coffee top off. I'll continue to frequent this establishment and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is top of the line. Delicious food. Amazing owner. Dawn welcomed us into her restaurant and made us feel like we were at home. Food was yummy. I really enjoyed my experience at 5th Avenue Cafe and I'll be back ASAP. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"\"Greasy spoons\" are called such for a reason, but when you have a pool of that yellow margarine stuff under your hash brown, it's too much.  The biscuits and gravy were no better than the ones at Whataburger, and the eggs are definitely not fresh eggs.  But the biggest letdown of all was the coffee, which was several hours old. I've had baths hotter than this.  The only saving grace was the very pleasant and attentive servers, who (bless them) kept offering coffee refills."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were searching for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. Happened upon 5th avenue through Yelp and weren't disappointed. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside was nicer.  Food came out fast and was quite delicious (Belgian waffle with strawberries, Cowboy chorizo). We also had a spicy, tasty, Bloody Mary. Service was quick and friendly.  One star off for pricing. I understand it's a brunch place and they make a profit off breakfast fare, but the pricing was super inconsistent. Waffle was pretty small for ~$8, yet the Bloody Mary was huge and delicious for just $5."}
{"text":"We dined there today after looking at the reviews on yelp however I was not impressed!  I ordered an omelette at the Servers suggestion, when I received it, it was not fully cooked. I flagged down my server and ask to have it recooked. When it was returned it was missing the orange slice  which was there when they took it away and it was still not done.  besides all that I found a hair in my cottage cheese. The other two people I was with were happy with their meals so that's why I gave it three stars.  Prices are reasonable as it's not a very expensive place to dine if you're looking for something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Great local spot for breakfast.  The servers were very attentive and make sure the coffee cup was filled.  The food was served quickly, delicious and priced well.  It has the feel of a local establishment, neighborly with a steady cliental coming through the door the 90 minutes we were there for a breakfast meeting.   Places like this are too often replaced by chains and franchises.  This spot reminded me of ol fashioned diner or perhaps Scott's Generations or Good Egg where the servers often seemed to recognize a customer, nice breakfast, pleasant atmosphere and efficient service."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Had the French toast and eggs with side of 2 bacon slices. The service was great and the food came out quickly, the noise level at 10:00 a.m. was really good even though the restaurant was located on a fairly busy road and the prices are reasonable. The only thing that wasn't good was the coffee. Maybe make it just a little bit stronger or invest a few more on decent beans. Would come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My family and I popped in for brunch and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a lovely little cafe with friendly but quick service, delicious and very affordable meals, and quaint seating. The menu ranges from standard breakfast foods (I.e. omelets, scrambles, and waffles) to lunch and dinner foods that made me want to come back later for seconds. The booths are small, but comfortable for a party of four and there are tables for slightly bigger groups. One of the owners stopped by our table and refreshed our coffee and told us a little history of the cafe which was nice. Overall, I truly enjoyed my experience and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Adorable cafe with delicious food and friendly staff.   The staff is always very nice and quick with bringing out food and refills. The food is always yummy and never a let down.  Dawn and her staff always go the extra mile to make our dining experience delightful.   I highly recommend you visit 5th Avenue Cafe."}
{"text":"Great service. Timely and friendly place. Good prices for breakfast for down towny area. Not a fancy place but not a dump either. Go there!"}
{"text":"Suprised that I've lived in Phoenix so long and hadn't discoverd 5th Avenue Cafe.  Thank you Yelp for giving me the tip on my smartphone.  There are freakin' few breakfast restaurants, except trendy expensive places, that serve alcohol.  Being the day after Christmas a Bailey's 'n coffee sounded pretty good.  No problem.  While my brain pointed me toward a lighter side, I ended up with their corned beef hash, which I'm pretty sure is made on premises.  I topped that with a couple of poached eggs (I almost expected them to tell me no-way, but they cheerfully took the order).  Not being the biggest potato fan I opted for fresh fruit, which was more than adequete.  An order of raisin toast rounded out the meal.  1) Price - superb. didn't see anything over $10 2) Food quality - a few notches above average and way above fast food chains 3) Service - GREAT!  Only thing is they seem to throw multiple servers at you 4) Ambience - pretty cool.  Kind of a musical theme. 5) Clientele - mostly older vets it seems.  Nice guys. 6). Value - For me (a light eater) it was perfect, but the portions are a bit on the small side.  This is one place I will be back.  For breakfast and for lunch.  It's just a good feeling place, and there are so few of them left."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for breakfast & lunch!  Everything on the menu is delicious,  good home cooked comfort food.  My hubby introduced me to this place about 10 years ago and I/we are regulars.  Customers are always welcomed with a greeting & a smile.  Service is great!  Wonderful place to have a quick business lunch or leisurely meal with a friend,  while service is quick, you never feel rushed.  The owners,  Dawn & Earl,  make time to know their customers & check in with all.  Balthazar usually has my iced tea at my table as soon as I sit down and Gabby, Crystal,  Jesse & Paula take excellent care of us.  LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I Love the old time bar feeling this place has. The food was awesome, I haven't had a burger that good in a long time! It's large and Juicy, and the toppings bar let me make it just the way I like. The staff seemed to be slightly less than happy to be there, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and think maybe they weren't having the best day. The place was clean, and although the Freestyle Coke machine was down, there was a regular fountain drink machine made available so we could still enjoy a cold drink with our burgers.   I'd say we'll probably be back. It's a drive for us from Peoria, but when we're in the area we'll stop in again."}
{"text":"This is one of those 3.5 star restaurants but since it is close to downtown and actually has a parkinglot in the back, I'll bump it up to four.  The food was pretty good.  I had ordered the biscuits and gravy.  Mind you, they weren't as good as Breakfast Joynt's but it was pretty solid.  The biscuits tasted fresh and were not hard.  The gravy could have used more pepper and sausage in it but I resolved the pepper situation and the giant sausage patties that came with my meal helped solve the other situation.  I came out of here full and happy.  The price is right and the place is full of a great mix of different people.  Really a good place to people watch.  I will most likely come back."}
{"text":"I love 5th Avenue Café, starting with the friendly staff. Chances are you'll be warmly greeted by Dawn, one half of the husband and wife ownership team. Then a parade of servers will make sure your order is promptly taken, your coffee and water promptly refilled and your dishes promptly cleared.  The location is good, especially convenient for anyone working or visiting St. Joseph's hospital right across the street. It's also historical. The restaurant originally operated as Upton's (established 1955), a well known dining spot for politicians and celebrities back in the day.  The food is great. Breakfast and lunch. One in our party this day mentioned that the Top of the Morning Omelette was the best omelette she had eaten in ages. The pancakes are light and fluffy. The coffee is served black and hot. Unique requests are happily honored. Specials are posted on a chalk board behind the counter. Mimosas available!  The ambiance is that of a simple diner. Not trendy. Not industrial. Not mid-century modern. It's comfy. The 5th Avenue Café is a locally owned neighborhood restaurant that serves classic comfort food. Expect friendly people, advertisements embedded in the tables and delicious food."}
{"text":"AMAZING place for weekend brunch! The food is great and the service is incredible. Everyone is so friendly and I love coming here. I definitely recommend everything on the menu and make sure to add a mimosa, too."}
{"text":"Best place fur breakfast and lunch! Friendly staff and portions are pretty big. So tasty. I'm very happy with this gem! Gotta come in and eat. They close @ 2 though so get here early."}
{"text":"Good hangover food! Inexpensive, a little greasy, but tastes pretty good.  I enjoyed the omelet but did not care for the toast, which seemed a little stale.  My wife's bagel and egg sandwich was also really good and very inexpensive.  The service was not great. It took a long time to get our order taken.  When the food came out, my omelet was missing an ingredient.  Instead of fixing it, they simply added it in a container on the side.  Um, I wanted an omelet, not fondue.  For service, they loose a star.  Overall, not bad, not amazing, but by far the best breakfast place within a couple blocks of Thomas and Central."}
{"text":"I just left the cafe and feeling good about it.  Good basic breakfast food.  I got an English muffin ham sandwich, which was good. It came with hash browns, to greasy, but over all a good meal. 3 people, $18.00... Ya get what you pay for.  And one more thing, there is beer.  :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast is good. Liked the staff.  The coffee is horrible. Like swamp water and zero taste. Also, they don't filter There drinking water. Two very simple things to fix to earn this place another star..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now, always a great place to come to if you don't know what you feel like eating....and for good simple french toast! Most of all love the prices--cheap good food.  Breakfast here is awesome:)"}
{"text":"Have visited this place many times, the feel is nice and the staff are great. This time I got the \"mile high\"... I'm sorry but in wasn't impressed. The bacon was warm at best, $2.50 to sub potatos intead of hashbrowns and they weren't hot at all. I still love this place but I will stick to skillets.. they are hot all the time."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to try 5th Ave Cafe despite the fact that it's near my house...why? It just doesn't look that great from outside. I finally went, and I was glad I gave it a chance. The breakfast menu is large and varied (oh and very affordable, which is great!). There aren't any options on their menu that are super 'special' or 'different,' but this is a diner, so that wasn't expected. I tried their grits (they were fairly tasty), pumpkin pancakes (pretty yummy), egg sandwich on an english muffin (probably could make this at home, but the egg was cooked correctly, which I appreciate), and the chicken fried steak (can't comment.... I don't typically like chicken fried steak anywhere). This place is a no frills diner and I'd definitely return if I felt like that kind of breakfast."}
{"text":"Do not go here! The food is very bland and tasteless. We were waiting for a long time for our food to arrive and the table next to us that got there after us got their food first. There are funeral and nursing home advertisements all over the tables and it's very depressing environment."}
{"text":"Horrible place... I ordered 2 egg breakfast with bacon! The bacon that was served to me was rotten, smelly and slimy... I told the waiter and he asked if I wanted something different I said know I was grossed out and he apologized and gave me a 10% discount on bill.   Very disgusting and disappointed. Stay away or you'll get salmonella poisoning!! I wish I could give them negative stars!"}
{"text":"The pork chop and eggs special was delicious!!! Great idea Dawn. You're on the cutting edge of breakfast specials. I can only image what masterpiece you might create with something like meatloaf."}
{"text":"Very nice and laid back place. The food was great. I gave it 4 stars because I asked for no bell peppers and they gave me bell peppers. Staff is awesome"}
{"text":"This is the type of breakfast diner I find most appealing. It has a family-run type of feel to it with excellent food that beats the price of most other breakfast restaurants. I could tell this is a well-loved eatery when I showed up and almost every single table and booth was taken at 9AM. I had the chorizo cowboy skillet and I was in heaven!! I couldn't ask for anything better. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"I loved this kick back mellow spot. The staff was cool and relaxed and very friendly ,the food was great and the portions were big and the food was good the next day too. I have no pix because I are that shit uuppppp ! It was a skillet . Yummy!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim with some friends. None of us were from Phoenix, we were in the area for a charity run and decided to have a real breakfast, not the hotel continental. And we got a real breakfast. I ordered a small stack and those pancakes were pretty big and fluffy. It was also super cheap. My friends were also very satisfied with their meals. Even with the semi large group, the food took almost no time to get to us and the service was friendly. The owner even came up to us to welcome us because she knew we were not regulars."}
{"text":"Far and away the restaurant I have frequented most often, 5th Avenue is superlative for service and food quality for the price. Other reviews describe it as a greasy spoon or good hangover food. Perhaps - but then if these folks were looking for cordon bleu, they were in the wrong place, weren't they. It's a breakfast/lucnh place, so compare it to Denny's or IHOP - with exponentially improved quality.  It's as healthy as you make it - you can order french toast, eggs, and bacon or an egg white omlette! They are awesome at accepting alterations on menu items. The only thing I ever ordered that I didn't like wa the Fiesta Omlette - chili beans over eggs. Not because it wasn't tasty - but it was just a weird combination that didn't work for me.  This morning, boyfriend and I went for breakfast. The cafe was busier than we've ever seen it - and, according to the owner, busier than he's ever seen it either! Absolutely love seeing local businesses thrive.  If you're ever in Central Phoenix near 7th Avenue and Thomas and need a bite for breakfast or lunch, 5th Avenue Cafe may really surprise you with their homey atmosphere, friendly service, good food, and low prices."}
{"text":"Everyone has their own rating scale. Mine has been what ever I thought at the moment. I need to change and be more consistent in my ratings. One, two and three stars do not need much explanation it will be evident in the review. Four stars is we had a good meal and I will consider eating there when I am in the area. Five stars? I am planning on going back as soon. I will make a special trip to go eat there. Even if I have to drive 20 or 30 miles to do it.  We had just got our taxes done. It was ab out 9:00am and we wanted breakfast. I did go to Yelp to find a place in the area and this place had some pretty good reviews. If you blink you will miss the building. I had to turn around and come back as I did miss it. Parking in front is limited. I do not know what is is back or street.  The theme is music. There are many pictures of music and musical instruments around the room. The room is laid out simple tables and booths. There were quite a few people eating there but the noise was quite. Everything looked clean and orderly. The food was good, but breakfast is hard to mess up. I had two eggs, bacon, sliced tomato instead of hash browns, and coffee. It was good. The beacon was nice thick slices, not the skinny stuff you get some places.  One of the big reasons for the 4 stars was the people that worked there. Everyone was very helpful and willing to substitute items on a listed menu meal. Some places are not or want to charge extra. Her attitude was whatever made you happy makes us happy. If I am in the area I will eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  It truly feels like the local hangout/diner that everyone wishes they had in their neighborhood.  It was really awesome to look around and see the wide range of clientele in here and it makes for some killer people watching while dining, my favorite.    The menu here isn't terribly inventive, but you shouldn't expect it to be.  I chose the Cowboy Scramble, or something similarly named, which was eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, and hash browns all scrambled together.  Literally, it was all scrambled, not just layered.  It wasn't the prettiest dish to behold, but it was pretty tasty, and I would definitely order it again.  It tasted fantastic and was incredibly filling.  I only got about halfway through it.  I will definitely come back here again.  Service is good, the location is good, the food is good, and best of all, they have a decent parking situation.  Yay!"}
