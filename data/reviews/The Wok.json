{"text":"We adore this place! We only pick up so I can't speak to the dine in service but it's great when taking away. The food is fresh and seems of higher quality. I also don't notice the excessive sodium that I do with other Asian take out. The sizes are large but not so much you waist. I also like the containers the food comes in. All in all it's our new place."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!! I had a bag egg roll last time but its a hit or miss. But best Chinese food  around this area"}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese spot. Food and service are always  great. Portions are big so bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, nice staff, good size portions. Best sesame chicken in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but not worth trying again.  I got sesame chicken and it was pretty good, but the Hunan beef had very little meat and tasted nothing like normal Hunan.  The dumplings were ok, but the sauce was strange and sweet and they forgot my egg roll.  All in all it was not terrible, but it was at best ok."}
{"text":"Since this place is so close to our house I go there couple times a month for take out.  The staff is always very friendly and the food arrives fast.  While this is by no means the best chinese food I've had, it's much better than the typical chinese take-out place around here where everything tastes pretty much the same.  I usually have their Five Happiness and order extra sauce which has just the right consistency and taste.  They also have a lunch menu where the dishes are $5.99, which I think is a pretty good deal for a meal with fried rice and a spring roll."}
{"text":"Visited twice this week. Tried two different chicken dishes. The egg rolls were crisp and good well. Both dishes were spiced well, with fresh ingredients. Only spent $8.00 with a drink on both days from the much menu. Considered it a very good value. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"We have been regulars here for take out for years.  The ownership has changed at least once, and I am guessing that it has changed recently again.  The quality has dropped drastically.  After having been disappointed twice, we were hoping it was a fluke and tried again.  I always order a spicy chicken or beef dish and my husband always gets the house special fried rice.  Same poor quality.  It makes me sad that we don't have a decent Chinese restaurant nearby anymore."}
{"text":"This food is like any normal Chinese place. The place is pretty clean and the place is sometimes (cause it's pretty good) packed with people and I had to wait for a while to get my order in. It has pretty nice prices like for the weekly special has a cut down price."}
{"text":"So I went for a \"quick\" lunch today and ordered a simple fried rice and waited 20 minutes,when I caught the woman at the counter realize that my order wasn't placed so she sent the order and preceded to argue with another customer about a take out that was done wrong. Waited a couple of more minutes then left and ate at Johnny's Red Bowl . The End !"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service!! They forgot the shrimp sauce, so they called to let us know! When we went back to pick it up they gave us free egg rolls for our \"troubles.\" Amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have the best food. The egg roll tasted like it was microwaved, and my food just didn't seem fresh at all. Not a fan, not going back."}
{"text":"I've been all over the country and have had a lot of bad Chinese food, that is why I was so pleased to get great Chinese food at The Wok!  I had General Tso's Chicken lunch special and it was excellent.  Our order came up fairly quick, about 10mins tops.  The food was piping hot and tasted phenomenal.   This isn't a restaurant that is fancy with nice linens and crystal glasses.  It simply was a place to place your order and eat at one of their tables or take it to go.  The service was friendly and unrushed.  The house rice was just above average, but the egg roll made up for it being extremely good.  If you are in the area and hungry go to The Wok, portions are big and just a good all round Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"Our go to for take out Chinese as its conveniently located off 485 which is easily accessible when heading home.   The food is pretty good I haven't had any issues since we discover this place. The only issue we have is the fact that there is NO really NYC or Chicago style Chinese take out spots in NC. We LOVE some good Chinese that make you want to go every night(but don't go) and here in the QC we have been VERY UNSUCCESSFUL in finding that place but we have found light comfort and convenience in The Wok.   We only ALWAYS order the spicy green beans which is stir fried with tofu and I believe chicken but we always say LEAVE OFF the chicken. It's pretty flavorful and we like it. My daughter stamp item is the shrimp fried rice only and that's what she orders rah and every time. So as you can see we stick to two items and maybe one additional item like the spicy mix seafood mix minus the squid. This is only once in a while when we feel like exploring the menu a little more just don't want anything to turn us off so we stick to the regular items :-)"}
{"text":"Got takeout tonight from The Wok.  Ordered sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken dinner combos along with an order of chicken fried rice and Chinese doughnuts which my teenage daughter loves. Staff was friendly and order was ready in less than 15 minutes. All was very tasty and even have leftovers for tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Chinese restaurant!! We live about five minutes away and order from here at least once or twice a month . As stated in a previous review it is very difficult to find really good, high quality Chinese food. However, I would have to say The Wok will satisfy me for now."}
{"text":"Didn't understand the 90 sanitation rating, used to be our go to Friday pepper steak and chicken fried rice place. Never really tried anything else.  Quick, close by, reasonably priced. Never an issue. Until our last visit, and will never go back. Had eaten about half my fried rice when I saw something shining in my bowl. It was a staple. Gross. So I called them to let them know, maybe be more careful, they could not have cared less. Since they didn't care, neither do I. You ARE the weakest link. Goodbye."}
{"text":"Ordered veggie lo mien w/extra veggies only to receive a greasy, bland dish with very little veg. Fianc√© ordered Singapore noodles only to get a mass of bland, boring noodles, without much meat or veg.  Egg roll, wonton soup and veg soup all equally under-whelming."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find really good, high quality Chinese food close by... so I have tried several of the little take-out places in the 28277 area.   I recently tried the Wok for takeout and found it to be pretty solid.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and the chicken and sauce was good.  I wasn't thrilled about the mix of veggies they used, but it wasn't bad.  I got a meal that came with an egg roll and it was not the best egg roll, but I really prefer spring rolls anyway.    I went back for take out a second time and this time I got the garlic chicken with brown rice. It was not as good as the garlic chicken at Wan Fu, but I would order this again when I am looking for quick takeout close to home."}
{"text":"Great service And food was amazing!! We got hot wings, general chicken combo and five happiness and donuts!! Way too much for us to finish but everything was very good!! Will come again"}
{"text":"I went for wings. Ordered on the Yelp app which charged me less than what I was asked to pay. The directions will place you on the opposite side of the street. The wings though fried well and crispy had absolutely no taste. Not even any MSG...I'd have rather eaten cardboard. I certainly will not be visiting ever again."}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese restaurant on Providence Rd across from Waverly.  Nice menu selection. Food is good.   Today's selection is Hibachi Steak & Shrimp.  I was surprised that after paying over $12.00 there's was no egg roll included. Lots and lots of carrots.... small container and very small portion of steak and shrimp. The shrimp were medium sized but this dish was not worth $12.00.  I should have stuck with standard cheap lunch .   Overall the review would be the food is good. Some overpriced but good.     It's not a fancy place - the food is served on plastic & the utensils are plastic.  Not too many other negatives .... American Chinese cheap & fast food style but good. The restaurant is clean ."}
{"text":"Returned last night for dinner because OMG, that pork fried rice. My partner had the shrimp and eggplant with brown rice which he enjoyed. I had the cut wings and pork fried rice. Wings were quite good. A little different flavor. Subtly Indian in taste which is fine. The egg roll was better this time. The pork fried rice was on point again."}
{"text":"Probably my fave Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!  This is not a buffet!  Food is always cooked fresh to order and they always honor special requests.  Food is appealing to the eye as well as the tongue.  The edibles are served on disposable plates but don't let that turn u away. They play upbeat music which I prefer over most Chinese restaurants dj choices."}
{"text":"Excellent choice when everyone is hungry and there's no time (or energy) to cook! My youngest (who isn't a Chinese food fan) always gets the egg drop soup and spring roll. Their portions are enough to satisfy my teenage son and husband. We haven't tried everything yet, but so far so good!!! Friendly staff, clean dine in area."}
{"text":"Only ate here once; however, I wanted to comment because it has to be 'THE' cleanest Chinese restaurant I've ever seen in my life --the place was spotless!  The food was just like typical Chinese food though quite good.  They prepare the dish in a light sauce sauce --it wasn't too think, nor to thin for that matter.  They used the traditional vegetables water chestnuts, carrots, celery, etc."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give half stars on Yelp so I rounded up to 4 stars.  Don't come here for the ambience (3/5) cause that is not what you'll get.  It is a small strip mall type store so very small and vanilla inside.  The food this go round was decent but some of it was a bit off.  I had the general tso chicken which was very good (5/5) but the fried rice did not taste as fresh as before and could have used more soy sauce to up the saltiness (2/5) and the egg roll was not good (1/5) the cabbage tasted too raw and so it was too cabbage tasting as a result.  Still, we'll come again as it is overall good and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Great food.  Loved the service!! Price was amazing.   A must if you love Chinese food and are in the area."}
{"text":"I read someone else's review and they said the food was ready \"in like 30 seconds\"  I couldn't help but laugh when I got here and the food is ready in 30 seconds, give it take a few minutes. The menu price was $10 however the weekly/daily special was only five dollars. It's ok.. notice the plastic fork"}
{"text":"I am giving this 1 star since the food was decent. However, The service is negative 10 stars.  I have never seen such disorganization. I ordered the food on yelp to be ready by 6:30. I arrived at the restaurant and it was total chaos with people frustrated over the amount of time they had been waiting for their order.  I did not receive my food until 7:15 which was 45 minutes AFTER if should have been ready!  No apology or explanation provided by the two idiots working the counter."}
{"text":"When it comes to cheap Chinese, I think The Wok would be a crowd pleaser for the majority of people who dig cheap Chinese. I do not. The thing that initially turned me off was the lack of allergy information on their web menu, plus, when I called to inquire, there was an impassable language barrier issue. I was happy with their lunch specials and you definitely get a large portion for what you pay. It's pretty greasy though, especially the house special egg foo young. This dish was so greasy it was unpalatable. I would recommend this place if you like take out Chinese that is cheap and, honestly, pretty tasty. The cashew chicken and broccoli chicken were both pleasant tasting."}
{"text":"Came here to eat dinner. There were lots of to go orders but not many people were eating in. Chicken wings were good. Crispy and hot but on the smaller side. I got the sa cha chicken and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"We go here because it's one of the closest places to us. The food is pretty good. Average Chinese takeout but tasted somewhat more healthy if that makes sense. I also like that I could order online. I gave it three stars instead of four because the lo mein taste weird to me. It had more of a curry taste which I am not used to. I order fried rice from here and soup but not lo mein, which is a bummer because I love noodles. I also gave it three because it is a little more pricy than other places I have been too."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food for my area. I've had worse but it was fresh and wasn't bland. I had the general tso chicken with fried rice to go so I didn't stay in there too long; but the restaurant was clean, the people were friendly overall it was good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Small eatery in a strip center featuring your typical Americanized Chinese food.  They have a really cheap daily special, but normal lunch specials are fair enough on price. ( like $6.95).  Nothing fancy.  Just decent food."}
{"text":"The food here is ok, I had lo mein and had no issues with it.  The shop is neat and clean.  The service is good and food comes out quickly.  I ordered there and took my food to go.  They have some pretty decent lunch options to choose from daily."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Chinese restaurant. I came here during a lunch break because I seen the sign. OMG, the food was everything that I could want and more. So, I'm here today because I was passing by. I waited in the lobby for 15mins before they opened. There food was fresh again, just as it was the first time. I give this place every bit of 5 stars, they deserve it. My order: Pepper steak and onions."}
{"text":"We've had a perfect experience every time we've come. My 5 year old insists on ordering and everyone is always patient with her. We order to go, but usually end up eating a little there since my husband usually takes forever to leave work.  We usually get Sweet & Sour Chicken with fried rice, and Sa Cha Chicken, and lo mein. It's always delicious!  We like that it's pretty personable as well. We come here about twice a month, and we're always greeted with smiles :-)"}
{"text":"Good value for mony. Tasty quality and made to order. Great selection.:-)"}
{"text":"I've been going here for almost 9 years now.  The food has definitely changed.  Everything from the egg rolls, fried rice, to the sweet and sour chicken.  It's all different, and not for the better.  Very Disappointing."}
{"text":"Our regular Chinese restaurant is closed on Tuesday, which was a surprise to us, so we tried The Wok.  We did carry-out.    This restaurant is located in a shopping center.  Most of the business looked to be carry-out, but they do have a few tables.  I was impressed by the cleanliness of the place and the friendly staff.   We ordered general Tso's chicken, chicken with snow peas, mu shu pork, egg drop soup and crap rangoons.   We were all delighted with our selections.  Everything tasted great.  The portion sizes were large and everyone had leftovers for tomorrow.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lightning fast \"strip-mall\" style Chinese food.  It's exactly what you expect it to be.  It's a great spot to stop by after work and pick up a quick take-out meal for the family, but I wouldn't expect too much by the way of \"cuisine\".  Had the beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken recently.  All of which were made from picky-eater friendly ingredients, and were a hit with the kids.  I do like the fact that the staff is all Chinese and a few words spoken from the customers in Mandarin seem to go over well.  Overall it's nothing special, but a decent value for a mid-week take home meal."}
{"text":"Really sweet staff here. Last year I was I grabbing my niece a birthday cake from carvel a few doors down and they had a chicken fried rice lunch special for 4bucks. I was sold. Now I come in for the house special fried rice no pork. They have shrimp sauce which is the equivalent of yum yum sauce at the hibachi spots. Drizzle that over that rice n you will have a nice treat... thank me later! Lol"}
{"text":"The food here today was so-so.  The egg drop soup was ok.  The wings were overcooked as were the sad crab ragoons, which were hard eniugh to nearly break a tooth. The teryaki chicken was tough and there was so much rice. Even the Chinese donuts tasted of old oil and lacked real flavor. Disappointing.  Glad I had used a half off deal."}
{"text":"We have only ordered from here for pickup before. Tonight we tried sitting in house. The aroma of disinfectant and fried chinese foods hit when I walked in. The restaurant looked very clean. I love clean! We were greeted immediately though we were the only couple in there. After debating on what to get hubby ordered and our food was soon delivered to our table on thick plastic plates.  We first ordered the fried dumplings. These are literally fried, not steamed and pan fried to get the crisp. NO these are like deep fried the whole thing was crispy. Instead of pork they use chicken. Still it works.  Hubby got the sesame trio. It was full of flavor and the rice perfectly fried as usual. Lots of broccoli and a huge portion of meat. He even had leftovers! His shrimp had more breading than shrimp but the beef and chicken were fried and doused in sauce  Yay. What on this green earth possessed me to order Japanese food from a chinese food restaurant is beyond me...but I did and I lived though to tell you about it.  I ordered the hibachi shrimp and chicken. Before I  go into this please understand that we have ordered from The Wok a total of 3 times before tonight and never had I ordered anything that wasn't good. With that being said. I was disappointed with my food. There was no flavor. The chicken tasted like broiled chicken, the shrimp like steamed shrimp there was nothing spectacular about this. The \"shrimp\" sauce that came with was the most flavorful thing on my plate. The rice was really good though. I am disappointed in the hibachi food. I am hoping sitting in the sauce will help it taste better tomorrow at lunch.  Since the service was good and hubbys food good they are getting a 3 star. If tonight was my first time here I would never come back. So for now a 3 star until next we go back and I have something different to add."}
