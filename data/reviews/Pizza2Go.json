{"text":"Good pizza but horrible service.
Stopped ordering from them just because of their service. Otherwise pizza is good if you can get it delivered while it's still hot"}
{"text":"Pizza2Go is the way to go .. Good crust .. not mussy thick like dominoz ... red sauce has flavor of it own , unlike sour pizza hut taste.."}
{"text":"Standard crust is great, and the thick crust really revealed a pastry lightness and crispiness. Need I say more? I'll seal the deal by adding the toppings are fresh, well dispersed and the price is remarkable. The garlic dip included is bomb."}
