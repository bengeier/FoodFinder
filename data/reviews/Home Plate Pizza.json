{"text":"We eat at Fox's every year when we fly in from California during the Christmas season, and have never been disappointed! The cheese bread is dripping with garlic & cheese-yummy! The x-large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, & jalape√±os was also yum-with a perfectly crisp crust Again we were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken hoagie that was really good!! But the combo appetizer was awful. Soggy as hell and gross!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain. The pizza is decent but the biggest problem is getting in and out of the parking lot. It's on a busy stretch of Washington Pike. So be careful pulling out and I would recommend delivery."}
{"text":"Extremely good crust.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  I look forward to stopping again next time through."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Crust is just how I like it. Tasty sauce and plenty of cheese. Staff was friendly and accommodating to me and my toddler. Looking forward to eating here when the weather is nice and sitting in their gazebos. Inside seems to still be a work in progress but the pizza and service are solid. I'll be back."}
{"text":"When placing order and was completed call ended. When calling back was told my order was not put in after waiting for it. Replied with saying \"Are you F**king serious\". Went and got food somewhere else and got home. Later while relaxing upstairs in living room the next thing is it feels like house was shaking and thought was just train nearby. Didn't stop so went to see what was going on.  I was met with fully dresses with bullet proof vests and weapons police almost busting down door. They then say that's Fox's pizza den felt threatened and called police. I was told not to order and go there again. Messed up what happened but not to big of a deal not to get food from them since it is disgusting and law quality food."}
{"text":"Excellent place for good quality food.  Prices may be slightly higher than your ordinary local pizza place but well worth every penny.  Generous portions, fresh ingredients and most items made from scratch.  I've had wedding soup from numerous \"high end\" Italian restaurants and this, by far, is the best and most flavorful I've tasted.  The salads are also delicious, especially the homemade crusted cheese balls in the spinach salad.  I will definitely continue to order from Home Plate again.  It's a score!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is terrific !  Great tasting and seems like high quality ingredients. I had just eaten Fioris pizza a couple days prior. Eveyone says Fioris is some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh. To me, the Pizza from Home Plate was better!!  I like a like bit of crunch to my pizza too and this pizza has that too. I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or Fox's sign fool you, this is an entirely new operation.  The new pie in town is great, reminds me of the other names like Fiori's, Aiello's, Slice on Broadway, Mineo's, Aiello's etc.  It tastes nothing like any of those pies, bit it is great instantly recognizable pizza.  I had a sample in-store of the thicker crust stuff, and it was excellent.  I can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Didn't realize this place had a different name than was on the sign.  A big Fox's sign, but in the comment area below it had the name of the new pizza shop and more.  There is a gazebo under the trees to eat out and relax.  The menu has home made dishes and a few that are unique. The staff was very friendly.   Ordered a fresh made personal pizza.  It is small but very good.  Crust was cooked perfectly with a perfect pizza texture and taste.  The sauce and cheese made it a very good pie.    Home Plate has a special pizza oven that is only 1 of 3 in the USA."}
