{"text":"We were there for lunch and got a panang curry and padthai noodle. The food was great and got good service from Cherry. She is very friendly. I will come back and bring some of my friends too. Love it!"}
{"text":"Their yellow curry is veganizable and very delicious and flavorful. As well as the sweet and sour dish which we ordered with fried tofu. Everything came on time and how we ordered it. A little pricey for me but the food is worth it and delicious."}
{"text":"The spicy basil fried rice and panang curry are out of this world!!! 
Definitely try this place"}
{"text":"Paula and Cherry are my favorite servers here.  I eat here at least twice a week because of them and  the delicious food,  cheap price and big portions. Most importantly they are clean. Paula knows my taste and always recommends new dish for me to try."}
{"text":"I have been missing a certain dish from Kauai, specifically hanamaulu chicken. I ordered the salt and pepper wings and it by far the closest to it. Also ordered the wontons and papaya salad and it was legit!! I would recommend to all my Kauaians to check this spot out and at least try their salt and pepper wings. You'll thank me!!"}
{"text":"Their green curry gave me food poisoning I will never eat here again I don't recommend this Thai restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very convenient, close by our house and has delivery service. Food is delicious, the service is fast. We order to go a lot. I love the papaya salad. My husband love the fried  chicken wings."}
{"text":"I really like amazing Thai 2 the food is really good and the service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Very friendly service. The food was delicious. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this Thai spot!! Service is always awesome and Ava is a sweetheart! I got the Panang Curry with fried tofu, also had bell peppers and basil! So delicious!! And they have an awesome lunch special deal during the week!!"}
{"text":"Definitely on my list of favorite local spots! Great food, good atmosphere. If you are looking for somewhere in the Southwest that always makes your taste buds happy. This place is it!"}
{"text":"Food was good, really liked the pad Thai and especially the crab fried rice!! Bill came @ $80 and change, and we gave our credit card. When they came back with our credit card. They brought back the check and scanned credit card for $84 plus change without ever mentioning they charged us differently. I would have been ok with them saying \"we forgot to add item, here's your new bill\". but nope, they said nothing. Not one word! Wasn't like it was busy, as we were the only ones there and they had 2+waitress and us sitting next to cash register. Hmmmm. But really enjoyed crab fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Ava was a wonderful waitress who gave us lots of good recommendations for the menu.  Tasty Thai tea & free refills on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I've had some amazing Thai food before, but this was twice as good as any Thai food I've had in Vegas, the name lives up to the reputation! I had the Mongolian stir fry substituted with egg-fried rice. The dish was amazing. Clean modern environment, fast service. I'll be back more than a few times."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Crab fried rice and Shrimp Pad Thai were excellent.  Kids loves the Terriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"The curry is amazing and the service is fast i can't say enough good things about the food you have to try it!"}
{"text":"Don't get discouraged by the location or the size of the restaurant. From what I have had, I can vouch that this is one of Thai restaurants in town with higher quality ingredients and more authentically flavored dishes. 

We had Tom Ka seafood soup, crab fried rice, sea bass with sweet chili sauce, chicken pad Thai to go and fried banana balls for dessert. 

Tom Ka soup, hands down the best I've had. It's so hearty and flavorful, unlike the watered down versions a lot of other Thai restaurants have. you can see how creamy it is by just looking at it. The shrimps were juicy and bouncy in the soup. It just begs you to have one bowl after another. 

Being Chinese, my parents are particularly picky about fried rice and especially the al dente-ness of the rice (can't be too hard, too soggy, or stuck together, etc. ) The crab fried rice definitely met their high expectation. The sea bass was grilled. It was a little bit overdone, but the sauce was great. 

The fried banana balls were more like fried coconut balls with a tad bit of banana in the center. Freshly fried, they were just too crunchy (never thought that I would be complaining about that). After a day in the fridge and microwave, they were much better. 

Last but not least, the service was quick and friendly for the dining in. However, The restaurant was very busy with to-go orders. We ordered our pad Thai to go before ordering dessert, but didn't get it until 30 min after we already finished dessert. The pad Thai was fantastic, one of the most flavorful ones I've had, but the long wait was just so unexpected. 

Overall, I would definitely go back, especially for that Tom Ka soup. If ordering to go, I would give it 40 minutes at least for the restaurant to prepare."}
{"text":"Fast! Friendly! Clean! And most importantly, Delicious! The staff was friendly and kind. They exceeded my expectations and I would highly reccomend them to anyone else in southwest Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is probably my new go-to for Thai food! I had their chicken satay, beef salad, tom yum soup and crab fried rice (substituted with brown rice) and every thing tasted delicious. It's affordable, very clean, and simple. The service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Bomb! My best friend is Thai and I'm used to eating a lot of authentic Thai food and this place is divine! The flavors, the spices, so rich! The inside decor is a bit awkward... kind of modern so when we walked in I got nervous about the authenticity of the food but they are on point!"}
{"text":"Great food from the appetizer to the main course. Would recommend this restaurant anytime."}
{"text":"I used to eat at other Thai restaurant and after I had try this restaurant. This is the best in Town! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been eating here for over a year at their north location and it's always been so delicious! Their lunch special is the best. Would recommend anyone to come here!"}
{"text":"New name, same staff and same mediocre over priced food. So disappointed... I was excited thinking we had a new Thai restaurant moving into the old Restaurant location. I should have walked out when I saw this same staff."}
{"text":"What a great place hidden gem thats for sure. Good lunch specials food was exceptional coming back again that's for sure"}
{"text":"I like the crab fried rice. It tastes good. I just hope it's a bit dryer then that. For Tom yum,they should use the fresh shrimp not the frozen one."}
{"text":"It has a classy modern feel and their great service made it more welcoming. I was a little upset that what used to be Benjarong closed down but after checking this new place and ownership I have to say they did an amazing job at improving everything. What I did notice was their prices increased a bit and food made a tad different. 

Also, i don't recommend delivery. They took 1.5 hrs to deliver my food one time and forgot my Thai tea on top of that. I only live 10 mins away!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I was craving pad thai. Went right at 11AM and ordered the lunch special shrimp pad thai and a side of sticky rice to go. They asked the level of spice from 1-10 and I said 3.
Only waited about 12 minutes and it was ready.  Presentation was nice and looked really good. Sticky rice was exactly that, sticky rice. I've had better but it wasn't horrible. The salad was small but tasty. The egg roll was crispy and I really enjoyed the glass noodles inside. It was a pleasant surprise. The pad Thai had 5 large shrimp which isn't bad for a lunch size portion. The flavor profile didn't quite have enough of the peanut flavor in my opinion but was satisfying. However, I would think that a level 3 out of 10, my lips and mouth should not be burning afterward and they are. Overall a fairly neutral experience. I have had better and it was a little higher priced than I would have liked, but it was definitely better than the peanut butter jelly sandwich I was contemplating eating."}
{"text":"Another Thai joint in the SW? Why not!? :) We were here for a late dinner with the kids and wanted to try the new Thai restaurant nearby. I remembered this place used to be another Thai restaurant a while back. I was super excited when I saw the sign \"Amazing Thai 2\". 

Location: This Thai joint is located next to 808 sushi and AT&T store, in the same plaza with the Vons at Rhodes Ranch. It is a multi- stores plaza with huge parking lot, so finding a parking should not be a problem. 

Decor: Apparently, Amazing Thai did a great make over of this small cute place and made their own style. I loved what they did to this place, it was modern, looked brighter and chic. 

Service was a two thumbs up. The server greeted us with smile when we walked in. Filled my hot tea and the kid's drinks. Service was fast, efficient, and attentive. 

We were able to tried couple of their favorites: 

Appetizer : 
Crab rangoon: it was standard, nothing too special about it but we liked it. Two thumbs up on food presentation of this appetizer. And my kids loved the sauce. 

Entrees: 
- Pad Woon Sen with Chicken: this pan fried glass noodle with egg, veggies and mushroom was my kid's all time favorite. Their portion was generous and had extra noodles. The glass noodles was perfectly cooked and it was tasty. 
- Crab fried rice: another my kid's favorite dish. It was delicious with generous size of crab meat. 
- Khao Soi with beef: This was a Northern Thai specialized dish and not many Thai restaurant offered it. In Thai, they would used hand cut noodles (all hand made), and you could add your own choices of protein.  It was so fresh and delicious! Back to Amazing Thai 2, I was not fond of the beef texture, it was not tender and a little too dried. I also wished they used a different kind of noodle, a more flat egg noodle to maintain its texture after soaked together with the soup . I did LOVE the coconut curry soup based! It was on the sweeter side, but since I requested spicy level number 5, it was a perfect sweet spicy combination at the end. Overall, I thought Amazing Thai 2 did well on this dish.

Desert: We had mango sticky rice and it was an average. Not a fan of the mango choices (used a different kind, not the sweet Thai mango). The sticky rice was not cooked thoroughly, some was way undercooked. I did like the coconut sauce and had to give extra credits on presentation. It was cute and neat. 

I will definitely come back and try their other favorite dishes and unique deserts (hint: their pot ice cream)."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! I stumbled upon this place because it's near the Cold Stone by my house  thought we'd try it for dinner tonight. It's my new fave Thai food place in Vegas. The food was so good and the service was great. The price was right too. 2 meals and 2 apps for 39$ (and they were shrimp meals) definitely gonna go again."}
{"text":"They don't have that much selections. Most thai restaurants has beef/chicken satay meals, and chicken bbq meal esp on lunch menu. Their soup is plain as well. Just meat and few mushrooms. There's better thai restaurants close by. And im not impressed with customer service either"}
{"text":"Service was cold not a welcoming atmosphere. The food was not amazing our chow mien was swimming in a puddle of oil, the egg rolls were not edible you could see the oil moving around in between the egg roll skin layers. You get a free drink for yelp check in and they insisted on reading my review before I got the free drink. Very awkward."}
{"text":"So happy my family finally found an authentic Thai restaurant in Vegas. Do yourself a favor and try one of their delicious family feasts. Everything came fresh of the stove to our table. So delicious and well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Really grate authentic tasting food!!!! Tom Kar is delicious and fried rice was decent. I especially recommend the crab rangoon! If in the area pop in for a bite. Going to be a go to spot when in the mood."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food, nothing special but the prices are really good. Close and convenient to the office."}
{"text":"Best eggrolls I've ever had!  The Mango Beach dessert (coconut ice cream with mango and sticky rice) is phenomenal!  It is a little pricey considering the decor, but we'll go back for the food."}
{"text":"I've had some horrific experiences lately trying \"new things\" but I figured why not.... I ordered stuff I never had such as the basil fried rice and pad see ew which OMG.... where has this been all my life. I literally could not believe it was that good! The basil fried rice had just the right amount of spice and heat for my liking where the pad see ew was so tasty! Everything was great including the chow mein chicken! 

Service was great! Very attentive and for the prices, you will have left overs for days! Happy customer here"}
{"text":"Customer service and food are 5 stars for me! Refillable thai teas on top of that!!! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here & I seriously am so happy we found this place! Hands down best pad Thai I've had & the spicy basil chicken fried rice is also great. Found our new Thai place for sure! Thank you"}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  My first was a few weeks ago and had the Drunken noodles, which were really amazing.  
This time I opted for lunch special and the Penang Curry.  Heat factor 6 based on the 7 with the noodles.  
I suspect I will have to do a 5 next time because I have become a wuss with spice lately.  Still very enjoyable.  Great sauce and the pork was really tender.  
Staff super nice and cordial. 

Great lunch spot, I work up by the 215 so it's way nearby.  Never too crowded.  Comfy and a place to relax before heading back to the grind."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great red curry dish in the SW part of town and this did not disappoint!! It was rich and creamy. Just the right amount of spice. I'm picky with meat but the I thought the chicken was really good! And the portions were huge!! I do wish they gave a bit more rice but it's not expensive to order a bit more. I finished the leftovers today for lunch and it was just as good as last night. So happy I found this place."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I get it on postmates delivered to my house.  Great option for delivery. I like the basil chicken, and the kung poa."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their mix vegetables with beef! They add their own house sauce which makes the dish delicious and incredibly addicting."}
{"text":"I had the most AMAZING (see what I did there ) lunch here today. The service was awesome and the food literally blew me away. Every time I come to a Thai restaurant, I come knowing the exact 2 dishes I am going to order. The first, is the drunken noodle (I usually add beef and shrimp), and the second, is the Thai basil fried rice (with ground chicken). Today, my waitress took my experience one step further and  asked me if I wanted to add a grilled lobster tail to my basil friend rice. My mouth was salivating at the thought, and my immediate response was, ABSOLUTELY!  When my dishes arrived the presentation of the food was like art, and the flavors left me smiling from ear to ear!  My waitress (Ava) was very attentive throughout my entire meal, and great with offering appetizer recommendations on the menu. Thank you for such a great experience today, Ava!

I am so thrilled that I now have this little gem of a restaurant down the road my my home. Nice job, Amazing Thai. My experience was just as your name implies... Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service! Love the Panang Curry and Pad Thai. I'll definitely come back to try this again!"}
{"text":"Food is fair and overall it is dirty.  Clean the tables properly and sweep the floor.  No one wants to sit down to a table full of crumbs and sticky goo.  Clean the slip covers on the chairs - they are too stained.   Would have rated the restaurant three stars but it was just not clean enough.  

Rice was not fresh - part of it was crusty and hard, so don't keep scraping the sides of the rice cooker to the bottom. The other part was overcooked and soggy, mushy.  Rice and noodles are so important to Thai food - at least have beautiful fresh rice.  

Service was good but waiter forgot to place the order for one of our dishes.  (Jerky, beef jerky not the waiter jerky).  Eggplant dish was somewhat bland - we did not want it too spicy, but there was no spice and the chunks of eggplant were huge - quite ugly.  

Cucumber salad was good - fresh, crispy, but a bit too sweet for me - could have used some lime. 

On the plus side, beverages were filled up as soon as they were empty. Check arrived promptly."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I love that the server gives personal recommendations in terms of how the food would be best served (whether the sauce can be served on the side or not, and spice level recommendation). But honestly, the service was pretty slow relative to the number of people who were in the restaurant.  I think there were just two tables including us during our visit there. Makes me kinda scared to come here during primetime hours like dinner or lunch. But overall, lots of good things here. The green thai tea was bomb, and the fact that it was refillable is awesome."}
{"text":"I've order the red curry from Amazing Thai 2 about 4 times now and this last order my dish was extra delicious! 10/10 perfect amount of spice, flavors, and veggies! Can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"This was for a togo order. I was in a rush after doing some grocery shopping and I just saw this place near that Von's center. Apparently they had just opened. I almost went to the Hawaiian place but I like to try new places. 

When I stepped in, I felt like I was under dressed and they may not have lunch specials cuz it looked small and the décor was a bit fancy more than a casual looking setting.

This is their second location and they already had one opened on north side.

I decided to see if they had lunch specials at fair prices. I got a panang curry with chicken with spicy 5. I almost ordered an 8 but I remember that panang usually is spicier at a lot of places so I just asked for the spicy stuff on the side. So the 5, really was a 5. I think I should've ordered that 8 but I didn't want to be dying in class so good choice for me I suppose. 

It was really delicious and plenty of chicken in it. usually the chicken lacks at places. The lunch portion was a perfect portion for me. we get a salad and an egg roll. usually the portion is too much but I ate everything and didn't feel that food coma!

I also had a Thai tea. I believe 3 bucks for a Thai tea is a bit steep but I enjoyed it still. I'll give it another try and actually dine in next time.

Don't forget your stamp cards! every time you spend at least $20 they'll give you a stamp."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up, a piece of advice I'd love to give this place is to allow customers to select levels of heat on yelp and other ordering apps. I had to call to ask what their spice level was it's 1-10. They use traditional Thai heat which is VERY spicy.
I ordered:
Tom yum with chicken level 7
Massaman curry with tofu level 6

I can handle A LOT of heat so the level 7 wasn't quite hot enough for me, but he Tom yum was DELICIOUS.
This place WOULD have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the tofu.
I was given silken tofu which I have never seen in a curry, usually it's firm and cooked.
I took the tofu out because it was not good.

So, don't order the tofu and you're good!
The flavors were great other than that and I will definitely order from here again.
Especially for the Tom Yum!!"}
{"text":"Had there sweet sticky rice twice now and Hooed the second wouldn't be as bad but sadly don't waste your money.  Worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very good place for lunch. Very friendly too! We've had almost everything on the lunch special menu and its always been good. Come here weekly now."}
{"text":"Great service fast and friendly staff with great recommendations and honest opinions on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was nothing short of amazing- the food, beverages (Try their Thai Tea), and service! Their Pad See Ew and Pad Thai is awesome. Definitely recommend this little authentic Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is amazing. I got the Pad see ew and it was delicious. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place. It is my go to Thai place. Their curries are amazing and they give plenty of portions. As for their Thai tea, it is one of the best I've had. I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"The crab Rangoon is the best I have had. The place is very clean, the servers are all so helpful. The food selection- very varied."}
{"text":"Server was really kind! She refilled our drinks before I could even ask lol. Food was delicious and yummy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food anywhere in Vegas.  I love the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry.  My kids are partial to the egg rolls and shrimp rolls.  The people are friendly and always quick. Tip: if you like it mild then make sure you let them know and they will make sure it is done correctly."}
{"text":"If your craving crab fried rice this is the place. Free refills on Thai tea and coffee. Good and quick service. Would define come again"}
{"text":"Menu is not vegan friendly and fish sauce is premixed into all the curries and the sweet & sour sauce. Find another Thai spot that can remove fish sauce if you're vegan!

I left Amazing Thai and instead I went to Panna Thai - 2 miles away - and Panna does not PREMIX fish sauce into their dishes so they are a lot more flexible."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken is delicious. Also love the egg roll and soup. The staff tries really hard to make everyone feel welcome and to provide fast service. The lunch special is definitely a cant miss deal."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The chicken wings were food. Pad Thai was eh. Me and my peoples enjoyed the food. It was to be what was expected from take out Thai. Garlic shrimp was good. Nothing was over the top good though except chicken wings.  That's because I'm pre disposed to eating chicken"}
{"text":"Very cute setting! Friendly service too! Awa is so nice! Delicious drinks AND food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried to call on three different days to order delivery. Called twice each time and got hung up on. 

Very sad since we used to love the other Thai place that was there. Not at all pleased with this change in ownership. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"first time getting food from here, ordered take out. Grub Hub said it would be 40 minutes. got there is 35, not ready. no worries. 25 minutes later, they give my food to a delivery driver, give me his food, and they run out for my food. I checked my order, wrong name. idiot driver didn't. sorry, no tip. 
the food was very good, and Spicy, even at our requested medium. the thai beef jerky alone was okay, and much better with the Siracha they included. the cucumber salad was also really good. drunken noodles and beef salad were yummy. beef salad might be a bit sweet for some, but we liked it. 
would have been 4 stars easy without the service errors. i'll give them another try for sure."}
{"text":"If you're someone who eats Thai food regularly, you know when you have food that's missing some flavor. Because I'm not Thai nor do I cook Thai, I'm not sure what that particular spice is. Plus I take it spicy #9 which can sometimes get in the way of flavor. But this really truly was great Shrimp PadThai!! It hit all the notes in my mouth. I can't wait to try their Green Curry.  It's pretty quiet and small here. I hope this place catches on because it's really quite tasty!!"}
{"text":"Our server was nice.  Very attentive.  Food wasn't that great.  I had better Thai food.   We ordered the chicken Pad Thai, it was very sticky and doughy.   Tom yum soup was too  sweet for me.  Fried rice was a bit wet.  Food was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Very very kind people, they probably spoiled my kids a little too much.. I'm happy stumbled in on the place."}
{"text":"Nice little Thai restaurant with good service.  I ordered the pad sew wee flat noodle dish, it's good, but too sweet though.  The Penang Curry with chicken  is ok, not as what I expected, the sauce was just a little too watery. More room to make it better!! Will be back to see the changes"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! By far one of the best in Vegas ! Thai iced tea is the best !!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good fresh Thai food ."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We got the family set and it was worth it! Probably could feed up to 5 people.we are so full!! And the ladies are so sweet, it feels like eating at home! Absolutely coming back to this place! With free thai iced tea with refill!! So full! Happy tummy!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food great people friendly staff service.ordered Padsew it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Spicy Basil Shrimp, Crab fried rice, pot stickers and Thai beef jerky. Enjoyed everything especially the Spicy Basil shrimp. We received prompt service and would recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Me and my husband already have a wonderful time here at amazing Thai. People are friendly and service is on point. 

We get the pad Thai with beef and yellow chicken curry Spicy hot number 5."}
{"text":"If u want an authentic Thai food come here! It's a hidden gem in Vegas its next to Rhodes ranch. Aum the server is the best I love her so much!! The crab fried rice and home style duck fried are my faves! And don't forget their awesome Thai iced coffee"}
{"text":"The delivery was fast, and the delivery woman was funny. She knocked on my door to the tune of \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" which was adorable. We ordered the red curry and the Tom yum soup. The soup was fantastic. It was perfectly hot, and had intense flavor. It had plenty of chicken and mushrooms. It was seriously the perfect balance. The red curry had almost no flavor, and the rice was soggy. The bamboo pieces were also overlooked and mushy. I will probably never order from here again, but if I were desperate, I'd get the soup!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food was great. The place was nice and clean. The owners does not disappoint. I visited their first restaurant back when it first opened up, so i knew what to expect form this one. Once i found out that they were going to open up near my place of residence i was beyond thrilled. Get their fish with chili sauce. It is to die for! From their wide variety of appetizers, to their creative entrees, Amazing Thai has been my go to for my Thai craving. We will definitely be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Service is great. Restaurant  very clean. One of my favorites  in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Try out this new management Thai place I order Tum Yum with shrimp noodles, Thai Takomaki  curry, and the Cucumber salad and Thai tea for drink of course not bad at all this place used to be Benjarong Thai rest. Just be patient with one of the waitress the short chubby one is straight arrow shooter one might think she's rude but maybe it's the culture or need to be trained a little on customer service etiquette. I will give it another try on the fried rice menu and see if it's good. See you next time."}
{"text":"Delicious Food! Great Service, friendly. I love the Pad Thai & Chow Mein. Kob Khun Kha."}
{"text":"Not an amazing time waiting well over an hour for food. Not sure I'll be able to rate on the quality of the food because I may never get a chance to try it. Not pleased with this experience."}
{"text":"I placed an order for takeout-- we ordered Panang curry, massaman curry, and soup. We had high hopes-- but Benjarong wasn't very good (the Thai place that was at this location before) and this place isn't very good either. Same owners new name?

The curries weren't creamy or flavorful. The Panang lacked flavor and the chicken used was weird dark meat and cut in large hunks.

The massaman curry was very viscus and just again, not good. 

Unfortunately we wont be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This was definitely not authentic Thai food.  I love chicken in red curry.  Amazing Thai 2 has red curry that is more like tomato soup.  I could not taste red curry or coconut milk- just a very strong tomato taste.  It was horrible.  The chicken teriyaki was undercooked and way too sweet. I will never order from here again. Just awful."}
{"text":"2nd visit and I'm so disappointed in the Chicken Pad Thai. It's sweet, not sure what the sauce on it is but it's super sweet and not like Pad Thai that I know. The Chicken Satay is a bit charred so not enjoying this on my Mother's Day. Bummed."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp pad Thai, the noodle has a nice chewy consistency and they are not soggy. 

I also request them to bring their special spicy sauces/seasonings. There's definitely a kick to it and it's addicting.

The store itself is small and not contemporary by any means. It is pretty janky but the food tastes good. Staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I love a good thai place. I was surprised to see Amazing Thai 2 offers refills (dine in only) on their Thai tea and coffees. Being Asian my mom always made Thai tea growing up and if anything came close to hers' it would be this one. So yummy. 

Service is very nice and the restaurant is very clean as well. We care about cleanliness so I definitely inspected.

As for the food we both ordered red curry during the lunch special hours of 11-3. I ordered chicken red curry level 4 and he ordered pork red curry level 5. I'm a huge curry fanatic and have been to just about everywhere that serves curry, especially red curry. I love the curry here. Amazing. And the heat level is usually always consistent. Not too many places are consistent when it comes to their heat so kudos to Amazing Thai! We also ordered the crab ragoons. Let me just say... Crispy, creamy and full of flavor.

To sum it up we love this place and love coming here. Easy 5 star."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month and love it! The girls that work here are so sweet and the food is AMAZING. Love the recent menu overhaul! We like the spicy basil fried rice and pad kee mao!"}
{"text":"Place has okay food. It is not as good as it was before with the previous owners. Visited at lunch. Place is small and seemed to have all its tables full. I ordered chicken pad Thai. Also chicken satay and that was very good."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance good food its our first time to try this resto and im not dissapointed. Recommended for others to try it"}
{"text":"Nice meal after a long day at work. I started with the chicken satay appetizer. It comes with 5 huge skewers of chicken, sides of peanut sauce, and cucumber salad. It was a good starter. For the meal I had a Kao Soi noodle soup which is the noodle in the curry soup base. It was amazing! I love their Thai iced tea as well so make sure you order your Thai tea because it is refillable. 

The staff is very friendly and some have been recognize my orders when I get it. I go at least once a week and I will continued to do and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Overall decent Thai. Nothing exceptional, nothing wrong with it either. Fairly middle of the road. Given we have a number of other favorite Thai spots, this will not be frequented in our rotation. Worth checking out if you haven't been there before."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try around the area and we happened to this place. We got the family dinner plan for the four of us and for the price, it was definitely worth it. The food was good and we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I did takeout instead of Yelp delivery.  My order was perfect and delicious. I got a modified Spicy Basil Fried Rice and Tom Kha soup with tofu. Everything was so good, I dont know what they do to the rice but it's slightly crispy and better than most. One of the owners came out to make sure it was right, she was very sweet."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at the new Amazing Thai 2, which is in the space previously occupied by Benjarong, overall I had a great experience, I ordered from the lunch menu 6.95 for a rice and curry dish, included an egg roll and salad, very good price for lunch. I will return to try the dinner service."}
{"text":"Amazing is right! My coworkers and I had lunch here today and it was nothing short of amazing. The crab fried rice is filled with soft crab meat combined with perfectly cooked rice. The pad see ew came packed with flavor and crunchy bits of Chinese broccoli. The chicken pad Thai was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Our drinks were constantly filled and the waitress was so helpful when we needed to rush to get our check so we could get back to work. The lunch specials are a great deal and the portions aren't skimpy! I'm so glad o found this place so close to work!"}
{"text":"Good food and good price! Definitely worth checking out. Convenient location too in the Rhodes Ranch plaza."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu was delicious the ladies that run the place are awesome I promise you if you go here you won't be disappointed if you are hit me up and I'll pay for your food"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and it was fairly busy. The owner and server were very polite and caring. I ordered the noodle soup with wonton and pork with vegetables. Served in a large bowl, the food was fresh and appetizing. It's a small dining area but comfortable nevertheless. This is a great new place for locals to go for quality Thai food. The owner is very gracious and it's always nice to support a local business."}
{"text":"We were sad that Benjarong closed and changed hands but when we saw our favourite server, Cherry, we knew we were in good hands. The food was actually on par and perhaps had a few more innovative options than the previous restaurant. We heard it's a new chef, new menu, new everything. Just pleased to still have good Thai food nearby"}
{"text":"This place was good but I wouldn't say \"amazing\".  Coworkers said the pad thai smelled good upon reheating, and it was.  I stated \"mild\" for the papaya salad, but there was no heat at all.  Crispy pork was more like a karaage than deep fried pork belly, but was edible.  Probably would order again in a pinch."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, super happy! We are so happy to have a great Thai restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Me and my cousins ordered the family meal. They said it was good for 3 but we think it can feed up to 5! They have big portions and very delish thai food! Servers are really nice we requested to change the tom yum to tom khar and they agreed. Cucumber salad is really good same as the tom khar which is my all time favorite thai soup and the beef panang! We finished our meal with mango sticky rice which is not too sweet and is really really good! If only I can eat that much sweet I can finish the whole thing! We also had the coconut ice cream and rock road ice cream! Overall worth the price for the family meal even exceeded our expectations! Definetly a must try thai place! We will surely come back!"}
{"text":"Love the Taco Yaki, always my Favorite 
Everything is good, always nice to not have to travel a long way for good food."}
{"text":"Yummy thai tea and green tea! Food is great! The service is awesome. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Great customer service. Love the lunch specials. Would come back here again. It is so hard to find a good Thai restaurant in vegas, this is one of the good ones"}
{"text":"Oh man I am excited for this place.  So good!  Wow amazing Thai food.  I fed three people including myself with 4 dishes for 60.00.  They do have a spice level from 1 to 10 and you can add more later if you feel daring. Drunken noodle is yumms.  The tom kar soup with chicken, eggplant dish with chicken, oh can't forget the takoyaki is on fire! So delicious"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite thai places! The ambiance is great and the service is impeccable! The food is just to die for! Perfectly seasoned and not greasy at all unlike most thai places. Def 6 stars for me!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were VERY pleased with this place! We tried the pineapple fried rice and chicken pad Thai and both were absolutely delicious. I personally love the all-you-can-drink Thai tea option for dining in!"}
