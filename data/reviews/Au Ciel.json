{"text":"Ginette et Claude du café bistro Ô ciel accueillent tous leurs clients avec le sourire. On y mange bien : des sandwichs paninis originaux, des soupes et des salades. Ici tout est fait maison et ça se goûte dans l'assiette, car tout est délicieux. Pour se sucrer le bec, rien ne vaut le sucre à la crème ou le brownie maison. On y vient pour la qualité des produits, mais surtout pour l'accueil. Le Bistro Ô Ciel, un incontournable et le meilleur plan si vous passez dans le coin de Lachine sur l'heure du midi."}
{"text":"Such a charming little place! Simple menu, fresh food, and the staff (which I believe are the owners) is super friendly, knowledgeable of their food, and very good service!  The decor is very homie and modern, yet simple. It's like your grandmother's house, minus the old people smell. Prices are very affordable, and it's all fresh and healthy.  I had a chicken panini combo, which came with a salad and a bottle of water (12$ total). The salad had diced apples, yellow and red peppers, raisins, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and small pieces of walnuts too. It came with a side of olive oil based dressing that was delicious. The panini was amazing! The chicken was one of the most tender ones i've had, and it's cut into small pieces so that you don't have to rip it every bite (which also allows you to keep the panini together). The cheese was the same kind of cheese you'd have in a poutine, so you already know it was  The little bit of spinach in the panini was the cherry on top.  I definitely recommend this place! Good for a quick lunch, a nice afternoon date, or just pretending you're retired and you got nothing to do."}
{"text":"Au Ciel Cafe Bistro is a little gem standing at the heart of Lachine on Notre-Dame Street. It is in fact one of the few businesses who doesn't suffer from the curse that keeps the rest of the neighborhood seemingly stuck in the 90s in the form of a small town with few culinary options.  While it's logo and interior design is a bit \"quétaine\", Au Ciel confidently offers a fairly populated menu that includes many sandwiches, soups, salads and breakfast options for early risers.   We had a vegetarian sandwich and French toast, accompanied by an almond milk latte and a double espresso. The food was good and fresh; nothing worth going crazy over but certainly demonstrating a sustained level of care and quality. The latte was fine; not the best I've ever had, but definitely better than average. In this semi-ghostly part of town, I consider myself lucky already to have been offered almond milk, so I'm not inclined to be too judgmental about the beans, which were very okay.  The staff, which I assume was composed that day of the bistro's two co-owners, was courteous and efficient. They seemed very focused on their work whenever they were not chatting with a customer, awaiting future orders.   Overall Au Ciel Cafe Bistro is a nice little place, and from what I've seen one of the few establishments in the borough of Lachine that serves coffee and breakfast before noon. Worth stopping by if you are in the area."}
