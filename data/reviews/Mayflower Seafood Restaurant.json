{"text":"They make it VERY AND BY VERY, I mean EXTREMELY difficult to make a simple substitution to your order. For example, it you don't eat hush puppies and slaw but would like a baked sweet potato instead they want to charge you am extra $1 even if you don't get the other two items. I've mentioned these issues to the wait staff on many occasions. However, their management just seems to be VERY stubborn about it.  Another issue is that you can only get a salad as a side when you order a broiled platter. Why discriminate?  If I want a fried platter but with a salad as the side you have to pay an additional $3+ to get it. I don't get it. I've been eating at mayflower restaurants for over 20 years and this one just won't budge. Food is great, but serving the customer is sub pat."}
{"text":"My grandmothers favorite place.  So I only go when she wants a dinner out.   It seems to be a popular place with senior citizens.  Why? Cheap and fried.  Meals are cheap and food is ok.  I would never seek it out nor go without my grandmother."}
{"text":"I checked out this restaurant with a few girl friends while shopping in Charlotte.  The traffic was horrible, we were starving, so we figured we would try it.

This restaurant reminds me a lot of a want-a-be Disney restaurant.  They tried very hard with the decor, but most of it came off a little tacky and childish.  The cleanliness of the restaurant seemed to be lacking a little bit, and the food was not very good.  I tried their clam chowder, which started out good, but the more I at the weirder it tasted.  One of my friends ordered a salad, and the fish was not cooked correctly..

If you are looking for a nice seafood restaurant this is not the place.  If you are looking for a quirky environment with fried fish this could be your place?!?"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times before when we've visited. I love their food, hush puppies, and always a good portion size. I ordered the popcorn shrimp, I was even pointing at what I was ordering as I spoke, that came with a side salad or Cole slaw, and one side. When we got the ticket, Chelsia, the waitress, charged me for the salad. I asked her about it, and even got a menu to prove it. She had brought out the fried popcorn shrimp instead of broiled, even though that's the side I ordered from that came with a salad. Instead of fixing her own mess up, after I'd already half eaten my food, she said all she can do is take my plate and I can wait on broiled shrimp instead. HA! I told her I'd just take it out of her tip, and she said ok. Smh"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Maybe the gentleman was new but that is not an excuse. You cannot touch a dish rag and then bring out food. My broccoli tasted like dish water. First and last time here!"}
{"text":"I order the bake fish Cole slaw and broccoli. I received 1 bake fish ( suppose to be two) no broccoli, and 2 Cole slaw, 1 of my Cole slaw had an uncooked unknown piece of meat I the middle of it. Will post picture below.... OMG.... So nasty, I do not recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, nice people, fresh food, flavorless and bland....can we have some seasonings or something please!"}

{"text":"If you want a quick lunch and a lot of food, this is the place to be. Their shrimp is amazingly good and you get a lot! The hushpuppies taste great as well. We always had quick refills on our drinks and did not feel disturbed when eating here. Good place to eat fried sea food."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived around today (Sunday) around 5:00 pm. for an early dinner.  The sign on the door read open Sunday 11:00 am - 10:00 pm. and the red neon sign read \"Open.\"  As we stood waiting to be seated my wife and I read the day's specials on the white board.  Then we were told that they could not seat us because they were closing.  We could get an order to go if we wanted - we did not.  I suggested that if they were closing so early that they should change there sign.  As we got into our car, the read neon sign went off.  This was not our first time eating at this Mayflower, but it was disappointing that they closed early with no explanation.  We went on up W.T. Harris to Harbor Inn Seafood and had a delightful dinner.  I suggest before your waste your expensive gas or put forth the effort to try this Mayflower that you call and make sure they are observing their posted hours!"}
{"text":"Great fried clams, huge portions.  I  go here when I want fried seafood.  They do what they do well."}
{"text":"Ok. Thought I  would try one more time for crabcake.
My critique: 
1. SERVICE HORRIBLE. Took 40 minutes and me acting out to get the appetizer. Our waiter wasn't in the least motivated. The manager ended up waiting on us, and lo and behold, the entrees came out right behind the appetizers. 
2. Entree order not complete. Where's my salad?  Richard asked for a loade potato. It was not. 
3. Several tables that came in after us were served. Manager stated our waiter has been struggling all night. All night!? Its only 7:30.
4. Plus side, crabcakes were real and tasted good. Fried oysters great. Richard's seafood platter was good except the broiled shrimp was really cocktail shrimp.
5. Manager comp our entire bill. He said waiter did not even turn the ticket in for 20 minutes. 
Good thing the food is plentiful and good."}
{"text":"This places doesn't deserve a star at all! It's  disgusting! We ordered crab legs and the flounder and the crab legs came out cold with icy butter and the fish tasted like it set all day and was microwaved we took one bite and it left us with a chemical taste in our mouths. The manager came out and reluctantly claimed she took it off our bill but we still paid 35.00. This place needs shut down it is the WORST restaurant around this area. Take this as a warning DO NOT eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger for lunch today. It was pretty good. The service was great, quick and made just the way I like it!"}

{"text":"I've never dined inside here before.... Somehow, even when I intended to, I always wound up in the takeout section of the restaurant... You can't beat fresh, hot, fried seafood.... It's the one thing that's lacking where I live... I've eaten here too many times to count, and also at their Greensboro location... The servings are more than generous, the seafood is seasoned like no other place that I've been to, and to top it off, the prices are down right cheap for what you get... 
Someone pass along a message to the owners that I'll volunteer to be their first, or honorary customer if they ever plan on opening in South Jersey.... We need a quality place like this here..."}
{"text":"Where to start? Well the food was completely atrocious, the food was not even cooked completely. I order fried calamari it's was slimy, the fish was a breaded raw fish. The owner is a narcissist, when we tried to explain to him the quality of food is horrible, he did not apologize he just stated \"I serve hundreds of these platters every night\" and in a sense starting insulting us trying to teach us how sea food should taste."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great portions and friendly staff. Try the Catfish strips, there awesome."}
{"text":"This is the best North Carolina seafood place around really. NC style is basically fried with hush-puppies and fries.  

If you are health conscious then order your seafood broiled. The food is delicious and hot when it's brought to the table. The quantities are huge. There are always lunch specials and quite reasonably priced. The salads are fresh and good. The service is great and they are very knowledgeable about the selections. 

For you snow crab leg lovers, come on Tuesday nights for all you can eat. Truly the best place in town for snow crab legs. They serve 2 1/5 pounds on their regular dinner menu (all I can eat anyway). They are plump, hot and cooked just right."}
{"text":"We were in Charotte to visit My Partners Family and his sister insisted that she take us to lunch,,she had this place in mind and it took us about 25 minits to get there,,,
She was very excited because she claims the lunch Menu is the same as the Dinner Menu and is at Half the Price,,,,\"She was so Right\"
First off,,they put a Big-Old-Bowl of Hush=Puppies out that I have to say are as close to being addicted as I want to get to HP,,,,,We had the Lunch Speical Fried Cat-Fish and Pop-corn-Shrimp,,and let me tell you we had to bring Half of it Back to the Hotel,,,
All 3 of us had the same thing and with all the sweet tea You could Drink,,It was a fantasic afternoon Lunch,,What I also Like about the place was that it was right across the street from 2 malls,,and what a Great day we had,,,The Mayflower Restaurant is Just too good for the South,,We Need One Up Here in New Jersey,,,,,"}

{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday to fulfill my craving for crab legs. I ordered the 2-2.5 crablegs with loaded baked potato (almost $2 to add cheese/ bacon) and side salad. I was very pleased with my meal. My husband ordered the catfish (salt/pepper)/shrimp combination. Being from Mississippi, the catfish wasn't was a bit bland but fried to perfection and the shrimp was AMAZING! Their hush puppies are also good. The diner feel was laid back. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mayflower on and off for years. This place is certainly hit or miss. Today it was a miss.

It appears there are some new staff memebers who need a bit more training in customer satifaction. When the cashier asked \"How was everything\" I gave her an honest answer... 

\"It was just ok.\"

The cashier went on about her business of taking my money and offered no recourse or acknowledgement for that matter. 

So, after noting her lack interest in helping, I went on to explain my disappointment was with the stuffed crab. She commented that I should have told my server, which I certainly could have done. However, I opted to tell the cashier. Her next comment sealed the deal for me. She stated that telling her would do no good because she can't tell management. 

Really?

You can't, or you don't care enough to be bothered? Poor service. Bottom line.

Just to clarify, my complaint about the crab is that there did not appear to be any crab, but rather a shell full of stuffing. Crabless stuffing. 

I would have explained that to the cashier, if for nothing else, customer feedback. However, she was too disengaged to care."}
{"text":"Not the best fish I've ever had it lacked seasoning, but the tarter sauce was good a nd it was good portions"}
{"text":"I'm from the North so I hope I selected the right location but it's definitely the right restaurant. Delicious! My tradition each time I'm in NC. No complaints whatsoever. Quality and quantity of food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is great very family friendly and quite delicious pretty decent place good prices and great service half off on Wednesday which is one of the busiest days but still good"}
{"text":"It's fried seafood. Service is decent and can be quick if no one in your party orders something broiled (they usually get death stares from me and an extra 20 minute wait time). They usually have great combination specials (shrimp and fish or chicken). Most everything is reasonably priced. They make a good blooming onion. 

Tip: On Sunday you get a free salad with your meal - just ask for it."}
{"text":"Would be five stars but our waitress Erin kept forgetting about us. She forgot our napkins three times and said she would get us an extra order of hush puppies but forgot again and by the time she got to it, they had already been thrown out by the cooks. I like Mayflower but I don't see myself coming back after spending 40.00 + dollars there and being forgetting about so often....."}
{"text":"The food here is normally pretty good, when their regular chef is in the kitchen. Be aware!!! When the owner is in the kitchen as the chef, you are likely to get food that is undercooked or food that has sat out too long (possible health code violation?)
I ordered the fried \"fisherman's platter.\" The same thing I have ordered, EVERY single time I've gone there (10+ times). It comes with two different types of fried fish, fried scallops, fried deviled crab, fried shrimp, cocktail shrimp, fried oysters, Cole slaw, and a choice of side.
First issue- the Cole slaw was extremely warm, like it had sat out for hours. I advised the waitress, and she told me that a fresh batch was being made. Great!
Next issue(?) I began eating the scallops and noticed that they had been cut in halves (I figured this was a new money saving technique). The 3 halves were good, so I said nothing.
Next issue, I touched the first piece of fried fish, which looked like it had been refried several times. It was not edible. 
Next issue, I went to eat a fried oyster. They are not my most favorite food in the world, but I eat them here because they've always been cooked well. Well, until this visit anyway. I attempted to put the fork through it, and it would not go thru... I kept at it and the thing popped open and, not to gross anyone out, I'll just write that it clearly was not completely cooked. 
Next issue, I began to eat the shrimp cocktail, which normally comes out on a bed of lettuce (it did not this time, no big deal). I bit into the shrimp, it was warm. I gave the other half to my husband, just to confirm that it was actually warm (it was!). I called the waitress over just to give her a message to give the chef- simply, it seems like you guys are leaving food that's supposed to cold, out on the counters for hours. She initially advised me that the shrimp was supposed to be warm. I kindly informed her that- all of the other times I had been at this restaurant, the shrimp was never warm and that traditionally, shrimp cocktail is NEVER warm. She then advised that the owner was the chef for the evening, and she did not want to get yelled at if she had to tell him that. I told her no problem, no sense you getting in trouble for his sub-par, possibly health-hazard violation food. 
Now, I must mention that my husband had popcorn shrimp and chicken strips- and he absolutely loved it. He even asked for a container to take his leftovers home.
I was about to put my food in his container, because I don't like to send food back or complain about it. I normally just deal with the bad food or service and then never return to that restaurant. With everything that occurred on that plate, I could not in good faith take it home. I knew I would not eat it. I asked for the manager, and she took care of the issue.
Also note that around our table, several other tables had sent their food back a few times for other food-related issues.
We like the restaurant. And, will probably return. Just know, we will call ahead to find out what chef is in the kitchen. If the owner is the chef for the evening, we will pass on going that night."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and ordered the popcorn Shrimp and Flounder with onion rings and a drink. I thought the onion rings were too greasy and couldn't finish them. The popcorn shrimp was ok but the flounder was tough. The waitress was kind and helpful with the menu selections."}
{"text":"Ordered thru the take out 4 lunch orders. 2 popcorn shrimp with popcorn chicken. Horrible!!! They don't clean their shrimp what so ever. Yuck!!!! 1 order of the white fish seem like it was fried in old oil. The other order was cat fish same issue old oil. We dined here in the past and it seems like it's gone down hill. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"If I could rate this a 0 I would!  My husband & I brought my mother here from out of state to try the food bc he and I both love fish. She ordered the meal to go and the young kid working obviously wasn't familiar with the the menu bc he said her combo consisted of 3 pieces of catfish & flounder. When we actually opened the food we saw that she only had 3 pieces of fish total and onion rings for $15!!!!!! RIDICULOUS! 

Called the restaurant and was told to come back and they would see what could be done.. 
The young boy acted as if he was completely confused about what he said , while manager was present and the manager offered no apologies at least for the misunderstanding and for having us drive back there for nothing. 

We will not return and I will be sure to have my husband and his team if of workers stop going as well. Have advised my mom to call the credit card company bc that charge wasn't what we were told we were paying for. Sometimes an apology is enough but they wouldn't even do that. 

Horrible customer service!!!!

And no don't bother asking to resolve this bc I'm not wasting any more gas returning."}
{"text":"When I checked in and saw the 2.5 star rating, my hopes for a good dinner plummeted, much like my opinion of this place the minute I started eating. 

I normally read up on places before stopping by, but deciding to be spontaneous with a coworker, Mayflower Seafood Restaurant popped on our radar and so we walked in for dinner, not really knowing what to expect. The establishment is large, but there were BARELY any customers. The tables all have a tacky looking number card on top while North Carolina flags are hanging from the ceiling and nautical decorations are strewn around the walls. 

Clearly, there are a lot of seafood options, but I was surprised to see a pasta section as well. I didn't have much faith that those entrees would be prepared well so I chose the broiled tilapia filet with coleslaw and corn as my two sides. Complimentary hush puppies, fried balls of dough, were served first and these reminded me a lot of onion rings. It had that slight onion taste, but the dough inside was dense. I couldn't eat a lot of those without spoiling my appetite for the main course.

But after getting my fish, I realized maybe I should have stuffed myself with those instead. When I chose broiled tilapia, I didn't expect to literally just get broiled tilapia, but that's what I got. No salt, no seasoning, it was just bland and gross. Thank goodness there was the lemon wedge, giving me SOMETHING to add to that fish. The fish was flaky in some pieces and dry in others due to uneven cooking. The coleslaw that came with my dish was missing and the corn was literally just canned corn served on a plate. They didn't cook it or season it at all. 

It was more than clear that the cooks didn't care about the food and with that kind of attitude, I can't say I care much for Mayflower Restaurant either.

Not worth a single second of your time."}
{"text":"Great service and nice food. Interior reminded me of a generation passed, but large fish tanks provided entertainment.  Had clam chowder which actually had pieces of clam but was a bit too salty for my taste. My parents and I got our hands dirty for snow crab, lots of effort but worth it. The captains platter came with fried everything, shrimp, oysters, scallop, fish, deviled crab, side of cole slaw and sweet potato.  First time I had sweet potato with cinnamon sugar.  The food was good but I won't be craving fried food for a while..."}
{"text":"Have always loved this restaurant but not this evening. We sat down at 8:40, at 8:50, we walked out and left. The 3 waitress/waiter staff that we've had in the past were all cleaning and refilling ketchup bottles and no one could stop to even acknowledge that we sat down. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 ate here around 3 in the afternoon on Thursday. There was only one other family dining at the time so we had our reservations but decided to try it anyway. Boy am I glad we did.  My 7 yr olds ordered of the kids menu, just wish they would add a small hamburger to it, but over all they were fulled of fresh chicken nuggets and grilled cheese sandwich with fries. My husband ordered the Thursday special of catfish and grouper I believe with onion rings, boy that was alot of food.  He LOVED IT!!!!!! I tasted his catfish and it was on point!!!! I ordered the two combination of popcorn shrimp and oysters with a baked potato. OMG the plate was so full!!!!! Everything was made FRESH nothing tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp. The oysters were big and plump and cooked just right!!! Popcorn shrimp were popcorn shrimp but NOT over cooked they were also perfect! I couldn't even eat all my food!!!!!!! We have been here for four days and this was the BEST restaurant so far on our vacation!!!! If we come back through here we definitely will make this one of our stops for lunch or dinner!!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, this was so good!
I would have gave it a 5 stars if my meal had been cooked just a tinch longer!
It didn't have that heavy greasy taste that some fried seafood can leave in your mouth!
The portion are big and plenty!
I walked out with a togo box for a late night snack and lunch for tomorrow!
The fish was light and had a fresh taste!
Everything was piping hot just the way it should be!
I love to eat at places where the food is good and this was some dayum good food!"}
{"text":"Southern food. Always fried. I haven't been so healthy conscious about my life, but since I graduated and have nothing to do why not become healthy? I came here for my graduation dinner as I didn't want my party to spend a lot and at the same time I just wanted a place to just talk and socialize. This place isn't far from UNCC so we decided to just come here and get our bellies full.

This place is decorative to say the least. A lot of paintings and pictures that makes you feel that you're on a boat itself fishing for your own seafood. The ambiance and feeling it gives you is that well, for me it was let's get some seafood!  

I ordered a platter that had basically all of their seafood on one plate. I think that the food was okay. All fried seafood, which I guess isn't bad. However, I believe that if you're really craving for some fried seafood this is the place to go. Don't think about getting something that's not fried here... 

Overall, I had a good experience. The service was good and the food was filling. I had left overs at least so I didn't have to cook the next day's meal!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and was attentive for the most part. However, I ordered crab legs (and ate 2/3) when I discovered the final third was still frozen. Last time this happened to me at another establishment, I got sick and haven't eaten crab legs since until tonight. The manager offered to bring out more crab legs, but I didn't want anything to do with them. We were give a 20% discount on them (reimbursing 1/5 instead of 1/3 of the price.) If you decide to go here, just make sure you check your food before you eat it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Gyro and fries,I must say was hot and fresh this time around.Usually a hit or miss on the food bit was definitely on point this time.Server was nice and attentive except she passed me a couple times and didn't offer a refill on my drink until I was finished my entrée. Overall 4 stars today."}
{"text":"Food was barely ok didn't kill me yeah! But I barely ate half of the fishermen's platter 16.95 fried flounder was too fishy tasting lost my appetite, crab cakes barely had any crab meat just taste like stuffing fillers,fried oyster had rock hard cracked shell piece in it almost chip my tooth. Still I tipped 20 percent to my waiter for filling up my drink 3 times cause cups are so tiny like kids version. The place was pretty empty for Nascar race week everywhere else were packed. Finally at end of dining paying at the front register ,guy doesn't count back my change properly from 100 bill and throws my change on floor which I had natural jerk  reaction reaching down for. He gives me half ass sorry remark then hostess and waitress started laughing giggling as i walk out. Guess that shit was funny. Dude looks like Spanish gangbanger than someone who should be working in front of restaurant wouldn't recommend place to anyone or bring left overs to dog."}
{"text":"Family intended to go to the other location but GPS brought us to Concord.  I order the broiled platter, husband had the fried Catfish and Peppered Trout, daughter got Crab legs.

We will try this place again if we are ever in this area."}

{"text":"Always come to Mayflowers! The staff is alway nice. Today I did take out. My order was fresh and the wait was not long."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting and the last place you should go and pay for some food. The service was horrible and our food was cold! The seafood looked and tasted as if it was fried in year old oil! On top of all of that the fish and shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer section at the market pre-cooked. When I asked for something else instead the manager wasnt even courteous enough to accommodate me and take what I originally ordered off the bill! I still had to pay for both! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Better off going to McDonald's!  Not even worth 1 star!"}

Portion Size:  Large (A)

Overall: Better than a typical chain, but hardly anything to remember.  For the quality of food and price; it's easy to see why they're in business.  However, the quality of food and service, will continue to keep them off anyone's Best Restaurants List."}
{"text":"This is the BEST seafood, not greasy at all. The owners are wonderful and really want to know if anything is not right (and they actually fix it)! The catfish is huge and very fresh as are the oysters and Jumbo shrimp.  The clam chowdar is the family's recipe YUMMY!!
  I LOVE it here!!"}
{"text":"Best waiter in years!! Gage was awesome! He is attentive but not stalkerish.  Serves can make or break an experience. If you have Gage you will definitely enjoy the awesome food."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood place around really. Sure, there's Red Lobster, but you don't get as much food as you do this place for the same price. 

The portions are quite large and I normally take food home it's so much. Their seafood is mainly fried, but they do have a broiled menu as well. I normally get their pick 3 option. You can pick 3 of whatever you want from the list of favorites (oysters, deviled crab, jumbo shrimp, popcorn shrimp, clam strips....to name a few). I normally get the popcorn shrimp (because if you get the jumbo shrimp, you only get about 5 or 6), scallops, and clam strips. Let me tell you, they pile it on high and the clam strips are actually strips, not sticks and over cooked. The fried foods are never overly greasy and fresh. They do have these weird hush puppies that look like onion rings. Im not a fan of them, but then again, i've never really liked hush puppies. I never walk out of here feeling hungry.

If you're on a budget, look up the days that they have the all you can eat specials and such because the bill can get up to $50 for 2 people if you don't watch it. This is the reason why Im giving this place 4 stars. You get charged $2 for a loaded baked potato, and $1.79 for tea or soft drinks."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional but the seafood tasted nothing like it used too! We got two broiled salmon plates and the fish was brown and tasted fishy. Not good!"}
{"text":"how do you run out of crab legs and you are a SEAFOOD RESTAURANT!?!
SERIOUSLY,  how do you only have 1 server working during? lunch? 
This is absolutely ridiculous, we came for lunch bc of limited time and it's slower than Christmas in here! 
Growing up in Concord, we are obviously Parton's of this establishment and never really had a problem until recently. The fact that they are completely out of crab legs is the straw that broke it for us.
Mayflower needs to get their sh*t together !"}
{"text":"Seafood isn't my first choice, but we stopped in for a birthday dinner and were pleasantly surprised.  Service was friendly, and portions were nicely sized.

Apparently they are doing well, because there was a good crowd the night we were there.  The only real complaint is that the cocktail sauce is, well, just odd.  It wasn't your standard horseradish-based cocktail sauce, but instead an odd concoction of, well, something else.  Very strange.  Everything else was good.

The most difficult part of the dinner was actually finding the place.  Apparently they used to be right up on the road, but when the drug store (Walgreens?) moved in, they made a deal that moved the restaurant back from the road, so now you have to look a little to find them."}
{"text":"Fried seafood heaven. I don't even know if they even have anything else on the menu. Family loves to come here, even folks from out of town, and I'm not entirely sure why, because they should realize that we are not anywhere close to the ocean. Maybe they feel that it's the most authentic fried food that they can get or something.

The staff is really friendly, and the food typically comes out fast, which is nice.

One thing that's a bit odd is their cocktail sauce. It has about the right consistency, but the flavor is just a little strange. It's not that it's bad (as in spoiled), it just doesn't taste right. It's like a tartar sauce and cocktail combination or something."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, ordered some hush puppies to start with and they were amazing!! I ordered a baby flounder and some deviled crab while my boyfriend ordered jumbo shrimp and normal shrimp. Food was beyond bad, coleslaw tasted like it was old and had been opened for a while. The shrimp had no flavor whatsoever!! They were very watery and had a pinch of old bay seasoning.  I wouldn't suggest eating here at all. Waitress was very nice but the food was just a major disaster. Even the water tasted weird!!"}
{"text":"First visit was here.
Server help me to menu.
Food was ok.
Service also ok.
Overall ok experience."}
{"text":"When you read the sign out front, it says they have been serving seafood since 1980, the problem is I think they have not changed any thing about the way the prepare there meals, I'm guessing the menu is exactly the same it was back in 1980.

Mostly fired fish, and sides, and it was not even fried good. 

Yuck!"}
{"text":"His place is one of my goto fish camps. Great fish and shrimp, excellent service or a reasonable price. Portions are more than enough to satisfy."}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright.  It seemed like a family oriented restaurant.  The workers that I did interact with were super nice, and that gave me a good vibe to this place.

When I first walked in, I thought that the setting was very appropriate for a seafood restaurant.  I enjoyed all the nautical decorations that can be found throughout the place.  My favorite of the settings were the walls.  I truly liked how they had the walls painted like the ocean with ships sailing around.  I definitely felt like a sailor ready to go on an adventure!

The food I ordered was alright.  I believe it was the Captain's platter.  It was a lot of fried stuff.  My favorite thing from my whole dish was the deviled crab.  I would go back only for that.  I did like their ranch sauce.  I used it a lot to dip my food in because the food didn't have much taste to it.  

All in all, I feel like this place can be a hit or miss.  I wouldn't mind trying to give this place another go."}

{"text":"Celebrated my moms birthday with a family dinner (30+ people). This place was not a good choice due to bland food and rude staff.  Some severs were nice however management was not.   We sung Happy Birthday and a member of management asked us to keep the noise down.  As we go to checkout, the line was ridiculously long to pay for our food.  Why was there only one register open on a busy Saturday evening?? We should have went to Captain Steves!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice outside and when you walk in.  Typical seafood / lighthouse / beach theme with nice decorations. 
First, I want to preface this by saying that the service and Arnold Palmers were really good. 
Ordered hush puppies and they looked like onion rings when they came out.  The flavor was good though. 
We both ordered the Caesar salad and the dressing came out as a package. The package said Creamy Caesar but tasted more like Creamy Italian.  It didn't have any Caesar flavor. 
Next was the dinners.  My husband ordered Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce was milky and peppery.  The shrimp were so overcooked that they were pasty and the noodles were overcooked even by my standards. 
I ordered the Ribeye and Scallops with sweet potato.  The steak, although it did come out medium rare, was tough to chew and had little flavor.  The Scallops were a bit overcooked, but not bad.  The Cajun / spicy seasoning was overkill and very spicy to eat for my taste.  I had to drink a lot as well as eat all the bread to cool my tongue. 
Overall we were not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I saw the horrible reviews before I ordered. But my coworkers wanted this for lunch and one promised me it was really good. 

However, my experience was not really good food. I ordered the Cajun seasoned broiled Mayflower Platter. It consisted of Fillet of Flounder, Alaskan White Fish Fillet, Sea Scallops, Jumbo Shrimp, & Fried Deviled Crab. The seafood itself was very bland. You could see the Cajun seasoning but there was a serious lack of flavor. It desperately needed salt. Thankfully I had some homemade salad that I could eat it with so that really helped me out. They had a picture of the mayflower platter on their website and my seafood looked nowhere as succulent as theirs did. My shrimp were definitely not Jumbo - even though the description says it. They were more like medium 41/50. What a rip off. The scallops were sweet but small too. The fish fillets were thin and you can tell they were all frozen. Not fresh. 

I did try a couple of the hushpuppies and those were not bad at all. And the deviled crab did not taste like crab. I couldn't even see any crab in it. It was just all breading.

I did receive a side salad and steamed broccoli with my platter. I didn't eat the salad since I had my own but when I went to eat it the next day, it was all watery and brown. So that was a no. But the broccoli was cooked well, flavorless but I added salt. 

Overall - I would not entertain the idea of eating here again."}
