{"text":"Had the steak mini tacos. Fresh and simple. Fresh cilantro was nice.   The service was fast and friendly. Nice gem!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We get take out and the girls at window are always friendly and food is awesome! Tacos, tostadas, burritos, everything has been great! Fast and fresh tasting everytime weve stopped by!"}
{"text":"First time here and liked it very much!  The shredded beef tacos are big and delicious my kids loved the beans and rice.  Chips and the salsa bar are excellent.  Definitely will be back!  It could use a little redecorating but all in all, our favorite fast food Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are solid, homemade tortillas and the chorizo is excellent. Good prices, and a fast drive thru too."}
{"text":"I love this place, food is great and so is the price. I dont know how many times i've stopped in here with friends after a heavy night of drinking to sober up. Hits the spot with the Carne Asada burritos!!"}
{"text":"I love how they have quality food for a great price. Senior taco and filibertos have nothing on Ramiro's."}
{"text":"On My Goodness!!! And I mean REAL GOOD!!! ....they were actually mashing the refried beans as we walked in !!!!  Totally Homemade and authentic Mexican Food!!!  Enjoyed the Flavors ....they even have a drive thru!  Really recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I ate at this Romeros years ago when it was good. Over the years the food has gone downhill. I've been sick to my stomach twice when I've eaten there and I Won't Go Back. If I go to Romero's I go to the one over on 107th and Indian School."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food spot !! I love their rolled tacos , you can tell they are made fresh and not just frozen ones like other places . The beans and the salsas are the best !"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito used to be the best in town but now instead of using real potato's they starting using french fries. Not a true breakfast burrito anymore, so sad that they tried to fix something that wasn't broken and made the perfect burrito average at best."}
{"text":"Great little family owned diner. Nothing fancy. The food and friendly faces make up for that. My husband and I love Mecican food and we rate this place 5 stars for great food and big portion."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, nice people who work very hard.  I love their fresh roasted chipotle peppers.  I eat there about once/week, I've never had a less than satisfactory experience.  It's my go-to place for excellent Mexican food."}
{"text":"Carne asada taco salad is the best, horchata is always good and their salsas are really good. I also love their mini tacos and burritos."}
{"text":"This is a very basic Mexican restaurant in one of the oldest strip malls in Goodyear. We have been going here for about 7 years now. It is one of those places one goes when one thinks about it. The food is almost always good, but has missed its mark a few times. In this miss it is usually because the food is just not warm enough. But this is not the norm. Working here one earns the money and it is done with a smile and efficiency. SO if you are ever in the neighborhood give them a try."}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona for 35 years, I saw Filiberto's rise and decline in quality ingredients.  This place is the opposite of poor quality.  I've eaten here twice in the past week. Carne asada burrito was delicious and hot, like they just cooked the beef.  I just had carnitas tacos with rice and beans. All of it was very good. Carnitas had flavor and it wasn't like eating pork jerky.  I want more of those tacos right now.  I live in Mesa and have now made this a stop any time I'm on the west side or passing through."}
{"text":"Great food and prices! Highly recommend if you want basic good Mexican.  We ordered our typical beans rice and corn tortillas and were completely satisfied with the price and quality of our food.  The gal taking our order was the cherry on top, sweet efficient knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"I'd never been here until last night and its really close to my house. So, we gave it a shot last night and it was pretty good (at least what I had). The prices are good and the food was ready fast. The only problem was that the pollo asado burrito one of us got was really salty and made up mostly of onions. The person eating it gave up halfway through. I really liked my rice and bean burrito though.   Four stars!"}
{"text":"I easily spend at least 60$ a month here. The last three times I've gone through the drive thru, they mess up my order. I am not one to go back and make them redo my order, but I will simply stop going there."}
{"text":"what a great gem. we ordered 8 street tacos and of different kinds. All were great and the employees were very nice and helpful. prices were excellent and we loved the salsas."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Ramiros. The restraunt is small. However, the staff is friendly and accomdating, and thats why I feel terriberible having to say the food just wasn't very good.  On this visit we ordered chips/salsa, beef tacos, a beef burrito, and a carnitas burrito. The salsa/chips were okay. I was disappointed with the carnitas burrito as I was with the beef burrito,  the meat was somewhat dry and slightly overcooked. The burritos are packed full of meat but lacked any other ingredients. I think the burrito would have been flavorful had it had a little more pico de gallo and seasoning as would the beef burrito.  The pricing is very wallet friendly, you can get a better Mexican meal, but you'll have a hard time getting more food for the price."}
{"text":"Went there hoping to find some aut√©ntica comida mexicana! Sooooooooo glad we stopped by it!  Food was delicious, fast and shit I was sooooo full and kept eating more! It was that good!   While sitting there and stuffing my fat face the place got so busy and people in and out in and out non stop, that usually shows when a place knows wtf they're doing.  I had an authentic carne asada plate and everything on that place tasted delish! I even licked the damn plate NO SHAME lol   Whenever back in Goodyear either for biz or spring training Ramiro's you can count me in cuz I will be there with my hungover ass from the night before, hooking myself up on some delicious and authentic Mexican deliciousness! Maybe you guys should teach Carolina's in Phoenix how to COOK REAL Mexican food!   Thanks for the great service and comida deliciosa!!!  Zazaza ya tu za za za za ya tu za ya tu za"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada burrito once before and was just barley decent. I returned a second time because it was the only non fast food chain spot that was in the area and needed something quick!   Carne asada burrito tasted a little funny, a little off, undercooked maybe?  Of course minutes later the cold sweats start the nausea, the runs.. food poisoned.  Unless you want to spend the rest of your day with bubble guts having self in the bathroom avoid coming here."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Been coming here since I was a kid and they're awesome. Way better choice than senor taco."}
{"text":"Just had the chicken burrito. Best I've had in Arizona so far. Going to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best in the West Valley. Carne asada burritos are awesome. Street tacos, rolled tacos are exceptional. highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"It's a fast food Mexican restaurant but the food was great! My dad and I were traveling through AZ and were hungry for breakfast. My dad had the chorizo plate and I had the huevos rancheros and both were excellent. I just hope I remember how to get here next time I'm traveling through AZ."}
{"text":"Consistently pretty solid. Would be an easy 5-stars if they would actually put the french fries in the fryer for  California burritos instead of trying to cook the on the flat-top.  The carne asada here is very good, and a nice change from the typical char-grilled smaller pieces that you find in Arizona. If you're accustomed to \"So-Cal\" style Mexican, this is a solid find. The drive through and late weekend hours are very convenient!"}
{"text":"You have to try their Super Nachos! Tortilla chips, re fried beans, delicious carne asada, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole...what's not to love? (And if you don't like any of those things, just ask them to leave off an ingredient). Their Horchata is also some of the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Have only had their ham, egg, and cheese burrito and also got the super breakfast burrito today. Honestly really good and portion was really good too. Their salsa bar is great with two salsas. (Red and green) also have peppers to bag up and take home which are also very good. Service is always fast and friendly. Flattop they cook on was super clean. When you work in the kitchen you notice and appreciate these things!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to give this place a shot. My two friends and I got a chicken burrito, chicken fajita plate, and a veggie burrito. It honestly tasted like cafeteria food. It was moderately cheap but not as cheap as people made it sound. I've had good Mexican food in this area... stay away from this one unless you're drunk and everything else is closed."}
{"text":"Been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Pretty good food. The setting on the inside seems a little cheap, but it is what it is. A simple little Mexican joint to get your Mexican food fill. If they only served beer! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's a mini drive-through Mexican place with amazing prices. Mini Tacos were soooo delicious for only $1.75 each. My boyfriend and I ordered two each of the chicken, steak, pork tacos, a soft drink cup, and a side of carne asada fries all for $21! The pork tacos were so good we ordered 4 more for $7. Meal was filling for $30! They even have a Coke-a-Cola freestyle machine so there were a lot of soda options and free refills. The fries were huge and they were not skimp on the meat or guacamole! We ordered a regular size and it was more than enough. Overall, great taste and value!"}
{"text":"First time! It wasnt awful but it wasn't great! Too many raw onions on their chicken tacos. The tortilla was authentic but the asada that was rolled inside lacked flavor. I doubt I will give it a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Delicious! I am no expert in Mexican food, but I liked this place. there were only three pictures on yelp so I added some more. the food is reasonably priced. portions are good size. they use styrofoam plates and cups, but that's not a reason to take away a star. there's a nice hand painted mural on the wall."}
{"text":"This place blows every \"bertos\" Mexican food place outta the water. Carne Asada is AMAZING. The tortillas are fresh. Try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Been coming here for years. Always great, friendly service and the best food in town! Never had a bad experience here. Our food is always hot, fresh, and the best quality. Why go anywhere else? Breakfast burritos are big and filling. Lunch we always get rolled tacos with guacamole. Yum yum! Our kids love all the quesadillas and burritos. Thank you Ramiro's for feeding us for years and we look forward to more years to come!"}
{"text":"This place had the best carne asada tacos I've tasted in a long time. They were seasoned well, very flavorful and generous portion. I would like to taste other things on their menu. The place was clean, my order was up fairly quickly, and it's a place I will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Looking for something quick and easy on Yelp, and found this place.  Almost didn't order as the place was empty, but we were starving so figured what the hey.  I had the fish burrito which was huge and absolutely delicious, and Hubby had the Chimichanga. The rice and beans were very tasty, my fish was perfect. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the guacamole. Too smooth and kinda weird. Tasted okay, but if I meet a guacamole I don't finish, then it's not perfect.  We'll definitely go back and give it another try. Restaurant seemed pretty clean to us, despite what other Yelpers have seen. Maybe they read the reviews and got the place tidied up."}
{"text":"We got the 3 taco carne Asada combo as a late night snack. Beef was not very tender, and the portion size for rice and beans was pretty small. For the price, $8.65, I thought there would be more. Rice was good, beans were a bit dry. Overall, better places to go, but if you are in pinch, and need a quick drive through, it will do."}
{"text":"MEH. This place is ok...but after having had Senor Tacos, I wouldn't ever go here again.  Do yourself a favor, drive a couple more blocks to Senor Taco"}
{"text":"Best carne asada burrito in the valley. Quality of meat is delicious. Refried beans are awesome with either fresh green or red Homemade salad. They also have a small salsa bar that is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Casual spot with good prices and great carne asada! No alcohol is available, so get it to go if you want a beer with it."}
{"text":"Tried Ramiro's based on a personal recommendation and we were not disappointed! The breakfast burritos were the absolute best we have had anywhere in years-looking forward to trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Good food but was very disappointed when they didn't honor their own coupon. A few months ago, they donated some food and coupons for a City of Goodyear event. So I picked up a few coupons because I like their food. Been eating there for years. When I tried to use the coupon today (3 rolled tacos for $0.99), the manager refused to honor the coupon because it was \"too old\". I pointed out that the coupon has no expiration date on it, and that Ramiro's just distributed these coupons a few months ago. Doesn't matter--I'm not accepting them, he said.   Can't believe they'd risk irritating a customer and losing business over three rolled tacos. Too bad."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food in a fast food drive through type place. The carne asada burrito was sublime."}
