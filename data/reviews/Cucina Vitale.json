{"text":"Breakfast was lousy though the people here were nice so I'll try again. Fritatta tasted like a sponge w no flavor. The toast was burnt yet cold and the potatoes were as hard as golf balls. I think it's new owners so maybe it will take a while to get the breakfast right."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years (almost every weekend), even when it was known as Cafe Davio. The staff is so friendly and as much as I try to drink my coffee as quick as possible, they make sure my cup is never empty! We noticed they just did a little bit of a food change in some of their menu items (I.e. The breakfast potatoes) and what a difference! The food has always been amazing, but now it's perfect. The breakfast portions are very generous (you will never leave hungry) and always cooked to order. We just love the family-style atmosphere of the place; every time we leave the chef always makes it a point to say good bye to his patrons #steelchef17! This place is truly a gem of the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian dining in Pittsburgh. We come here for any reason we can think of. Everything homemade. Excellent pastas, breads, seafood dishes, etc. byob which is a plus. Best crab cakes in Pittsburgh. Service is personal and friendly. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and both experiences were great!!  Love the small intimate setting and the kitchen being right there!! Wait staff professional friendly and knowledgeable.  Bread is serverd warm, fresh and oh so good.  Dipping oil, humus, and olives provided free.  The food on both occassions was incredible...fresh, flavorful - everything was perfect.  GO THERE!! We will again."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful but the service was lousy. Our server was only available to take our order and bring us our check. The food runners and busy boys were the ones that took the most care of us.   Probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I went to brunch on Sunday here and it was amazing!!! Excellent service, atmosphere and food. I got a frittata and it was delicious. Large portion sizes with quality ingredients! We got the brunch Groupon so we were able to bring in our own champagne and have unlimited OJ - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited dor brunch and the food was great! I got a frittata with their home-made mozzarella and it was delicious! The portion size was very filling. I also enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice! I liked that the kitchen was open and from scratch. I understand the latter may add onto the wait time, and am certainly willing to wait longer for fresh prepared food. Note it took an hour from when we were seated to when we got our food, but was well worth it in the end. Service was also great!"}
{"text":"I'm not telling anyone about this place . . . Unless they invite me to join them! We enjoyed quality service, superb entrees and meatballs better than Nana's! If I lived closer, I'd eat here every day!! Thank You Cucina Vitale!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant and my new favorite. The food is  always delicious, the prices are reasonable and the chef and staff are great!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade food.  Had the sausage and peppers. The tomato sauce was excellent.  greens and beans delicious. I'm still thinking about the truffle mushroom risotto."}
{"text":"Went here last week because we had a groupon and ordered two of the frittatas, oj and coffee which the groupon covered.  My wife ordered the CAPRESE $9 Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Basil, & Housemade Mozzarella I ordered the CALABRESE $9 Labriola Sweet Sausage, Roma Tomatoes, Red Peppers, Onion, & Provolone   The eggs were so fluffy and the meal was HUGE! The basil with the mozzarella accented each other perfectly in my wife's dish and the Sausage with mine was absolutely delicious. Plus, EVERYTHING was seasoned perfectly, so you know you have a cook that cares. I ended up taking half home and I almost always finish my plate.   The server made you feel at home. Even knowing we had a groupon, he came back for refills and opinions several times.  We are excited to go back and the prices are very very reasonable, especially when it is really two meals. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and I'm glad that it is on my way to work.."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN PITTSBURGH!!! The staff was so friendly and you can get a lot of food for not that much money! Highly recommend the buttermilk pancakes!will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Great value, actually inexpensive for what you get. Marsala was great, the \"gravy\" was the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"So disappointed after all the lovely reviews of this business. The hostess was so rude that I didn't even make it in the door. I tried to call and give them a heads up about my large party of seven as we were on our way to the restaurant. She told me they \"didn't take reservations.\" I told her I wasn't trying to make reservations. When she condescendingly called me \"honey,\" I turned the car around and our whole party went somewhere else."}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend to friends and family! They play Italian music while you enjoy your BYOB and meal. Paris, the waitress, amazing. Will return soon. Thanks Groupon!"}
{"text":"Dinner on Saturday night with friends.  Omg, everything was so good.  Three of us had the Linguini Grancho.  Amazing!  Husband had the daily ravioli special with lamb and he loved that as well.  Everything's here is absolutely perfect.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was excellent. The folks working were friendly and engaging.  And the breakfast was even better. Loved the breakfast sandwich but the whole menu sounded delish also. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner at the restaurant about 10 days ago. The veal chop was delicious as was the linguini bolonese. The halibut was a bit overcooked. All in all, however, we really enjoyed the restaurant. Our server was very pleasant and responsive. We certainly will go back again soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant. I've gone sooo many times for breakfast. Pancakes excellent. Specials excellent. Frittatas excellent. Breakfast sandwiches amazing. Now, dinner is also amazing. Frank, the owner is a cook and knows his Italian. The best home cooked, authentic, small restaurant Italian in Pittsburgh. Highly suggest the meatball sandwich, veal parm, or any of the seafood."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious ! it really was and the food is made fresh but that doesn't make up for the 1 hour wait for our food and 20minutes just for a waiter to bring us waters. Waitresses were really nice though."}
{"text":"Cucina Vitale used to be Caffe Davio, where we used to be regulars. The breakfast menu is similar to that of the former restaurant (the basics are still the basics, but more expensive, alas) but more expansive now -- more egg options on the menu, etc.  The coffee is an improvement, but the french toast leaves something to desire for. The service is still friendly though Sunday breakfast is a long wait. One good thing is that it's no longer cash only as Caffe Davio was, and the dinner menu looks good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly service. Free dessert for a birthday. Delicious pasta and the olive oil for dipping bread was great. Will go back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/brunch because they were offering a Groupon ($34 for $18).   Atmosphere: Feels like you're eating dinner in a friend's grandmother's dining room. There's an open kitchen adjacent to the dining area. The dining area itself is small with ~10 tables.  The decor is mismatched with dark wood tables and light wooden chairs. Definitely informal.   Service: The first 30 sec after we walked in was awkward because no one greeted us and the space was so small. We were then told to seat ourselves. A sign by the entrance would help make that less awkward. It also felt short staffed, despite the fact that half the restaurant was empty, which translated into a longer than normal wait in between getting the menu and having our orders taken, and not getting silverware until we asked after we got our dishes. However, the service was very polite, and we got timely refills on coffee and juice.   Food: I got a pancake with chocolate chips and the calabrese fritatta. It was delicious! The portions are generous and the ingredients fresh. The pancake, with the toppings I ordered, cost $3 and was the size of a dinner plate. I probably could have just eaten that. We also got freshly squeezed orange juice, since our groupon came with unlimited refills. It tasted very fresh. However, it was served in a small glass (1/2 pint), which is pretty stingy for $4. Not sure if that was a Groupon thing or the standard size.   Overall: I'd definitely come back for the food, though I'd order less.   Side note: The Groupon was unclear that we'd have to pay for the orange juice (I thought it came with free orange juice, but it seemed like the refills were free but not the initial order-- we paid $4/person)."}
{"text":"Breakfast is on point! The frittata is huge and fluffy. Definitely get the croissants they are the size of your head. Pancakes like hubcaps"}
{"text":"Great experience!  Food was fantastic and the service was outstanding.  The sausage and pepper and mozzarella pomodoro were absosutely perfect.  The greens and beans were awesome.  The specials sounded great but could Not pass up the veal chop millanese."}
{"text":"Husband and I discovered this place by accident- and I'm so glad we did!! Small and intimate environment, excellent service and delicious food! Everything is made from scratch- I especially recommend trying their house made mozzarella, it's heavenly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Met a friend at 8:00am Saturday morning- they opened right on time. Waitress was pleasant and friendly. Frittatas were excellent- both of us needed a box to take 1/2 home. Pancake was huge and really good. Excellent all around- will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came in earlier this morning and everything was great. The staff was so friendly, and the food was amazing. Some rude customer kept complaining next to us about his eggs, and the staff was incredibly friendly and nice about it which impressed me. I'll definitely be coming back here soon"}
{"text":"First timers tonight...my fiancée and I ordered take-out, Ravioli, Chicken Parm, and wedding soup. Felt as if I was back in my grandfather's kitchen as we began enjoying our meal. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce (very important) was on point, portions were adequate, homemade bread which was thick, warm and even more delicious when dipped in the sauce. We will be back, perhaps next time we will dine in their cozy, intimate atmosphere with a view of, and scents from the kitchen. Cannot wait for round two. Thank you Chef Frank!"}
{"text":"To celebrate two birthdays in my family, we made a reservation for 7 at Cucina Vitale. I heard the space was small, so we wanted to make sure we reserved a table. If you have more than a few people, I'd definitely recommend doing so because there approximately 10 tables. The restaurant is in the space where Caffe Davio used to be.   When we arrived, they had our whole table set with menus and water and we were greeted by a very friendly staff. It is BYOB with a minimal corking fee. We ordered the homemade mozzarella and the meatballs to start and they both were fantastic. This is a true Italian family owned business so do not be in a rush when ordering. Everything is made to order and we all truly enjoyed our meals! I had veal milanese with crab meat and a side of pasta. I was thrilled with my choice. Others in our party had the veal with peppers and the shrimp and scallops. Everyone raved about their meal. They kindly gave us two deserts on the house for the two birthdays we were celebrating.   This is a great addition to the South Side and we'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Our absolute go-to, favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!!! It's BYOB (always a plus) and absolutely amazing! For most birthdays and special occasions my husband and I come here and have for years and it has never disappointed. Everything is phenomenal. The service is always top notch. Whether we come here on a date night or with our young children, they're always great. In fact, right after my daughter was born, we came here with the whole family and he chef came out and entertained my older son (2, which is a tricry tricky age!). They always make us feel so welcome, special, and like a part of their amazing family, except they know how to cook!   You will not be disappointed! They know their clients by name and the food is THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. Reasonably priced menu, high quality food. Kevin gives first class service and Paris was very nice as a hostess. Can't beat the $8 frittata of the day and the bottomless fresh squeezed oj is awesome. Try the in house made mozzarella. Also, their mascarpone is dangerous. So good."}
{"text":"Five stars FOR SURE! Everything I had from the hummus to the soup to the main dish to the desert was so flavorful and great beyond measure. It's has to be the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh or anywhere. This place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Best Advice: MAKE A RESERVATION Great little Italian Restaurant in the heart of South Side. Owner, Frank, is the chief and has a top notch menu with Calabrian flavor.  The crab cakes are suburb and I loved the roasted carrots. The Mancini bread baked on the premises is mouth watering served with a red hummus. Small, about 10 tables with BYOB, has an intimate atmosphere with Italian favorites music playing in the background. Jen, the waitress, is very pleasant and welcoming and very efficient."}
{"text":"I am stuffed! As soon as I finish typing this I am going to take a nice long nap. We sampled a little bit of everything from the brunch menu. Make your own frittata, it was stuffed with ingredients and tasty. Also came with home fries and toast. The wife's waffles were OUTSTANDING! Bana Rama party in my mouth bruh!  We took what she couldnt eat home and she will be drinking the melted whipped mascarpone and maple glazed bananas with a straw later.  They do offer byob so we brought some champagne with us and made our own Mimosas at the table. Service was great and the corking fee was $5 flat. They brought us champagne flutes!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest place I have been to in a long while.  Besides waiting an hour for our food, the waitress never checked on us or refilled our drinks until after we got our food. The food was ok, but certainly not worth the wait.  Maybe this was an off day, and the service was friendly, so maybe I would give them one more try but probably not."}
{"text":"I've now had the honor of dining at Cucina Vitale for breakfast and dinner, and both experiences were superb.  I had heard a lot about this place when it was Caffe Davio, and was disappointed I didn't have the chance to try it before it closed... but much to my surprise, Cucina Vitale opened up with the same chef as Caffe Davio!    When I came here for breakfast, my dining companion and I arrived right after they opened at 8:00am.  By the time we left, it was obvious we had made the right choice:  every seat in this quaint, intimate restaurant was spoken for!  I ordered the lox frittata and was not disappointed in the least.  I love smoked salmon and never though to have it for breakfast besides a lox bagel... this frittata opened a whole new horizon for me! I ordered a hot tea with my breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of tea bags that I was presented with.   The staff on this particular day were all wonderful.  Pleasant, fast, and easy to chat with.    My dinner experience held the bar high.  I came here with my aunt and cousin to catch up on things over a bottle of wine (Cucina Vitale is BYOB!).  We started off with the meatball appetizer and the greens and beans.  The meatballs were huge, easily shared between the three of us, and had the perfect flavors throughout.  I'm usually one to avoid red sauces when I'm out to dinner (I swear by my family recipe!), but the red sauce that blanketed the perfectly cooked meatballs was superb.  I've never had greens and beans before, but could not stop eating the ones that our waitress placed in front of us.  Not too wet, not too garlic-y, and the beans still had a slight bite to them so it didn't feel like I was eating slop, which is what I always assumed greens and beans would taste like just based on other preparations I had seen.  I had the veal milanese for my entree and somehow managed to save enough room to finish about half before I had to ask for a to-go box.  The veal was nice and thin, with a beautifully fried crust, topped with tender lump crab meat and sautéed grapes.  Yum!  Our waitress was very pleasant and told us this place will make you feel like family.  A lot of people that came in for dinner while we were there knew the chef/owner Frank by name, which I always think is nice to see and a good indication of the kind of local establishment you're in.  I absolutely plan to be back here many more times and can't wait to try more of their menu!  All of their menu items, from the soups to the sauces, are made in-house.  You'll feel right at home here!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here as a family and really liked it a lot.  It's a cute little place with only about 12 tables.  There were 5'of us dining and the waitress immediately greeted us and was very friendly and helpful combing a few tables to accommodate us.  The food was really good.  I had the mediterranean Frittata which was very good.  The home fries were amazing the rye bread was very good and different.  My son got the Bananarama which was a combination of hot cakes and banana and walnut and was amazing!  Overall the wait staff and entire team was so pleasant and helpful it made for a very nice meal and experience.  Looking forward to coming back here when I am in Pittsburgh again.  As the restaurant is BYOB, the next I come I would absolutely bring a bottle of champagne as two other tables did for Mimosas."}
{"text":"Across the street from famed Waffles Incaffeinated, is this gem. My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new and we didn't want to wait in line at any of the better known restaurants in Pittsburgh. This restaurant had a wonderful atmosphere, and was very quiet. I ordered breakfast, and my boyfriend ordered lunch. We were both blown away by the quality and freshness of the food.  The owner and his girlfriend were the only two there, and they made sure we had a satisfying experience. We plan to come back soon! We are very happy to find such a great family owned restaurant in the City!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! Mozzarella appetizer was incredible. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First off, there is (or at least was ) a Groupon for brunch with unlimited OJ included. GET THE GROUPON. What we didn't know was the $5 corking fee was INCLUDED in the Groupon so bring some bottles of champagne as well.   I hadn't been to the space in 5 years when it was Caffe Davio. I loved their brunch and I loved this brunch as well. The portions were huge and decently priced. Even the wheat bread was amazing."}
{"text":"Brunch was a bust. It took forever to get our order in. Servers were too worried about cleaning tables for new guests rather than taking care of the ones who had been waiting forever to order.  I went with the banana waffles which had bananas and walnuts. While it was good, it was completely drenched in syrup. The waffle was completely soggy and eventually became inedible because of how sweet it became after it soaked up the syrup. I would've been satisfied adding my own syrup. My boyfriend ordered the salmon bagel. It looked good but for whatever reason he didn't care for it. He said salmon tasted off. We each ate about 3 bites then paid and left. Thankfully it was a Groupon.  Ill skip brunch here but the crab ravioli looked fabulous."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!   We had called THREE times before going and kept getting the voicemail. I wasn't even sure if they were open & initially we wanted to place a to-go order. We said forget it and took a chance by deciding to just walk over. There are so many other options on the strip we knew if they were closed we could find another spot.   AS SOON AS WE WALKED IN WE JUST STOOD THERE... almost 5 minutes ... the servers just looked at us. A flimsy girl finally approached us & cleaned off a two top table.  As soon as we sat down at 1:20 the waiter (some guy that did not want to wait on us... I know because he goes \"so & so\" will be right over & ends up taking our order and being our server anyway) tells us \"we close at 2 PM, so you need to know what you want.\" I was so thrown off but I held my tongue and sat quietly. I already knew what I wanted because I had looked over the menu on YELP. We place our order (glad we knew what we wanted or we would have been shit out of luck).... he takes our order and my husband ordered an orange juice and me a water.... our waiter puts our order in and begins to clean.... he cleans for a good ten minutes & still no drinks. Other customers are looking around. I'm so upset at this point I call over the flimsy girl & say \"could we get water please...\" her response \"well, what did you order?\" At this point I'm in flames and just proceed to walk out. I was a server and worked in the industry for years. I get it your ready to close but this was our first time visiting. We just moved to the area and could have been regulars! You just lost 30 percent tippers & great conversation. Keep up the hard work you two.   By the way after ordering my husband had sprinted like a mad man down the street to take out cash because apparently they are cash only.  After reading the rest of the reviews, it seems they have good days & bad days. Hope you catch them on a good day."}
{"text":"Finally an amazing place for Italian food in Pittsburgh!! There's nothing on this menu my friends and I haven't LOVED. The bread and oil is great. The house made mozzarella is a delicious appetizer, as is the fried dough. My favorite entree is the peppers and linguini, but every dish that's been ordered between my friends and I has been outstanding. Save room for chocolate cake!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon, and my expectations were blown away. While the Groupon stipulated that we had to order a specific set of items, our nice waitress clarified that there weren't any restrictions, and that it could just be used as a gift certificate with the Groupon's value. So we ordered two lovely (and fancy!) entrees that were recommended to us. First was the ravioli special, which was the ideal size for one person and came with about 4 to 6 ravioli stuffed full with crab. The dish was super flavorful with the cheese and herb toppings, although it can definitely be improved with a bit more variety, e.g. in terms of vegetables.  The veal chop was the star of the show. First off, it was huge and definitely enough for at least one person and a half. The meat itself was tender and juicy, and there was so much of it all along the bone. The toppings of crab (again!) and grapes (a very cool choice) added to the decadence of this dish. While this is probably something I would never order on a regular basis, it's definitely one to get for a special occasion or for spoiling oneself. Even if not this, the rest of the menu is also very attractive, and service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburg for the weekend, and experienced such bad customer service in every restaurant we went to... It was sooooooo refreshing to b greeted with a warm smile and great service.. The food was also delectable..  Thank u cucina!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place would have been tasty if they hadn't cancelled my reservation!!  My mother placed a 7pm reservation a few days ago and we showed up to find out thay they had \"called\" and since we did not respond earlier today they cancelled our reservation.  The owner then became extremely unpleasant and began yelling at my mother and grandmother. We ended up heading to the Double Wide Grill. I have not been so angry with an owner in a really long time."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best breakfast I've ever had. The service may take a little long but that's because the incredibly sweet and kind waitress is making you their fresh squeezed OJ right in the kitchen for you. Trust me when I say, you cannot miss a chance to eat here. Try the berry French toast you will not regret."}
{"text":"I found a groupon for this spot that was $16 for breakfast for 2 people and unlimited OJ. This place is BYOB so the fact that we could get breakfast and mimosas for $8 was a steal!   This place is tiny only holding maybe 10-12 tables? There was a bit of a wait when we first got there maybe about 15 mins. There was a larger group in front of us that was waiting for maybe  30 mins. You can see straight through to the kitchen and they squeeze their OJ fresh so there was a bit of a wait for that.   The portions are big. I couldn't eat all of my food. But all of the food was fresh and delicious. But the OJ for mimosas was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible , be prepared for some hostility to come from within ...BUT the food is soo good .  I'll be back for the Lox Frittata ."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. We both built our own frittatas that came with toast and home fries. They were excellent. We will be back"}
{"text":"Food and service is top notch!! BYOB had champagne with our brunch. Had lox & bagel my husband had the lox frittata which was also excellent. Prices are very reasonable and food portions, well let's just say come hungry!  Had a Groupon to top it off!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat brunch around 1130-12 on a Sunday.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table to clear out.  Once we sat, it took about 10-15 minutes before a waiter acknowledged us.  I even ordered a coffee that never came at any point during our stay.  Atleast 45 minutes passed before they even took our food order.  Which was ridiculous because there were 2 waiters/waitresses and they spent more time standing around then actually addressing the tables.  Once we realized that by the time we go out food and ate it would have been past 1pm (and we would have missed the kick off of the steeler game), we requested for the waiter to put our food directly in to-go boxes.  He mentioned it to the cook and we could immediately hear the cook complaining about the request.  Once a new table sat down, the waiter notified them that the kitchen was delayed.  Eventually we got our food, paid, and left.  To make the entire experience more infuriating, as we were leaving, the cook clapped which truly makes me never want to go back to this place.  It was a terrible experience overall"}
{"text":"This Italian spot is truely a one of a kind dining experience that is perfect for a small group of friends or a romantic date with a partner. The design is simplistic and comfortable on the inside with beautiful fresh cut roses on each table. I really enjoy each time I go here... especially for brunch. The staff here are truely lovely to interact with. They are dedicated to providing you a nice meal no matter how busy the place becomes. I am always more than satisfied with the experience here. I highly recommend the brunch frittata, this is a great deal with amazing flavors! The fresh mozzarella cheese is out of this world... Check this place out! It is a Pittsburgh favorite of mine."}
{"text":"On Thursdsy 7/27/17 we were seeking somewhere different to try. We weren't sure exactly what we wanted so we hopped in the car and started driving. This is normally when we do our best work it seems. We drove around and called Cucina Vitale on a whim. They had an open table and we made our way down there.  Upon entering I was surprised how small it was. I personally am a huge fan of an open kitchen. It was great to see the chef skillfully preparing his product. It's evident there's a great pride in what he does. Plus, you can't beat the smells. We were seated promptly and brought over the appetizer which was a roasted red pepper hummus, seasoned dipping oil and olives with hot salted bread. Very nice.  I had the house salad and enjoyed it. The greens were dressed nicely, and the Gorgonzola cheese was just icing on the cake. She had the Caesar salad which was enjoyed as well.  I myself had the tagliatelle bolognese and decided to add a side of shrimp to it. The shrimp was grilled perfectly. If you enjoy grilled shrimp you know that it can go from perfectly cooked to rubber in about a minute. The bolognese sauce was nice, and what I liked about it in particular was that the vegetables had not been overcooked, or completely cooked down.   My better half chose the Chicken Marsala and choose wisely she did. It was really good. The sauce had a nice flavor. The potatoes were excellent. The roasted cauliflower was a nice addition which she enjoyed and she hates cauliflower. The down side to her meal was one piece of chicken was a bit lukewarm, while the other piece was hot. Minor gripe at best. To some, this would be a major turn-off.  The food is stellar as is the service. We got lucky being able to get in on such a whim. Reservations are highly suggested. Make one.  We chose to pass on dessert. Next time we'll give it a spin and there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant has become our go-to place for dining out in the southside. We just had a family party there last night, and as usual the food was just superb. Great intimate setting... owner/chef is very accommodating to individual tastes, serving both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Hint: Don't pass up on the beans and greens!! Service is awesome too. You won't leave hungry here! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to Stagioni a few nights before dining at Cucina Vitale and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Cucina Vitale's food was superior. The complimentary starter of fresh baked bread with olive oil, hummus (I think), and olives was excellent - the bread was soft inside and the crust had a pleasant crunch. The Linguini Branchio was very tasty as was the handmade ravioli. We brought our own bottles of wine and had an excellent dinner.  We liked our dinner so much we came back for brunch. I wasn't expecting much from an Italian place, but I live nearby so figured why not! Brunch was great! The frittatas were huge, the bacon was crispy, and the fresh squeezed OJ was tasty (especially with the champagne we brought with us). The bananarama waffle was delicious, but it is very, very sweet. Our table of 6 shared the waffle and it was a nice contrast to the hearty frittatas and other savory foods.  I'd definitely recommend Cucina Vitale for dinner or brunch. Hands down one of the best restaurants in South Side."}
{"text":"Wandering along Carson Street on a Sunday morning, I was getting a little frustrated. Pipers Pub looked like a 1,000 person Frat Party had just dumped it's entire guest-list inside of it. And Waffles Incaffeinated had about 4 too many stroller-clad families waiting to get in. What's a hangry girl to do?!   The answer is Cucina Vitale. They have all your standard breakfast fare: eggs, breakfast meats, frittatas, pancakes, waffles, French toast, bagel & lox, and better than average diner coffee.   This is a small place. There are only a handful of tables, but we were able to get seated right away.   I had the triple berry waffle which came with fresh berry sauce and mascarpone. It was delicious! I've been getting let down by a bunch of dry and tasteless waffles around town, but this waffle was fluffy and flavorful. The side of turkey sausage was good too.   Service was a little slow and we had to ask for water/coffee refills a few times. But our server was pleasant and she apologized profusely for the wait time. A party of 9 was leaving just as we arrived, so the kitchen was backed up. Understandable.   All in all, this is a great place to grab a standard breakfast. I'll definitely be adding it to my Saturday and Sunday brunch options."}
{"text":"Loved it! Cucina Vitale is very quaint and has a European feel in that it's very relaxed and slow-paced. You go there to enjoy your food and drink wine over conversation. The meatball appetizer was divine, loved the bread and various dipping sauces, and the seafood linguini was delicious. I'd recommend making reservations. Don't forget it's cash only and BYOB!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after we were told there would be an hour wait at the waffle restaurant across the street!   No wait-quickly seated, FRESHLY squeezed orange juice and home made bread! everything was delicious and we will be back again"}
{"text":"Really nice little place with white table clothes, a view of the small kitchen and a view out the window to Carson Street.  Only 8 tables and you come here to dine.   BYOB, so bring one of your favorite wines and enjoy with a delicious meal.   We started with some fresh cooked bread, the dough comes from Mancini's that's baked in house.  With the bread we received some olives, a dipping oil and Giada for a great start.   The menu has some interesting choices including a few specials of the day..a fresh sea bass, homemade ravioli and pasta.  The fresh pasta comes for Ohio City in the strip. We shared our meals and the paperdelle was a good choice.  The crab cakes were very good..a toasted red pepper aioli on top and some grilled veggies and potatoes on the side.  Almost forgot that we had mozzarella pomodoro for an antipasti; the mozzarella is made in house and is a great starter.  With our meal we had a choice of a house salad or soup.  I had the shrimp bisque and found it to be a little light on flavor.     Our server was very good, helpful and friendly.  Be sure to make reservations as all the tables were full.  We did arrive about 15 minutes early and our table was still being used so we spent a  few minutes walking around the neighborhood and window shopping."}
{"text":"The make your own fritata is amazing. Also the decor and fresh roses are very nice touches. I recommend going to a relaxing breakfast. Feel free to bring wine :)"}
{"text":"The saltiness of some of the dishes as discussed in my past review has not been an issue in quite some time so it was either not the norm or perhaps they saw my review--either way, I really do like this cozy place."}
{"text":"Exactly the restaurant that makes you appreciate Italian-style cooking. Small, tables close together, daily specials and you're 15 feet away from the Owner and Chef. Wonderful food at reasonable prices and BYO. Our group of 8 was well cared for. The Veal Chop was perfectly perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. The Ravioli with Bolognese was terrific and our friends enjoyed their meals as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went to Cucina Vitale tonight with a group of five (plus my 2 month old daughter).  The meal was fantastic and the service was top notch.    We started with three appetizers: the mozzarella, the sausage and peppers, and the crostelle (amazing homemade Italian breadsticks).  For dinner, I had the chicken parm and my wife had the bolognese. Would highly recommend both.  In sum, cucina vitale is a quaint, welcoming, family-owned restaurant serving spectacular authentic Italian food.  Do yourself a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night with a large group from work ( reservation ) and everything was top notch. From appetizer to soup , salad , main coarse and desert.  We had excellent veal dishes and my eyes were amazed at all the dishes everyone else had, beautiful homemade ravioli , pasta , steak and well dressed chicken dishes also , amazing presentation. BYOB and water or coffee, do not have a bad thing to say , bene, Molto ' Bene ' !"}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half after being seated for breakfast for two. Terribly slow kitchen. The food was average."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate breakfast here about a year ago with a groupon, and while we liked the atmosphere I was slightly disappointed in the food (the frittata was a little too salty for me).  We decided to try it again with another Groupon, and this time was better. My wife's eggs were done perfectly, the fruit was fresh, and the ham was lean and cooked well. I decided to get a frittata with hot sausage and mozzarella, which was made fresh and had good flavor. Everything was good and the coffee was always refilled. We recommend it for anyone with nothing to do the rest of the morning, because it takes a while. But that's what \"made to order\" means, so well worth it."}
{"text":"The ingredients couldn't have been more fresh and delicious. As a displaced New Yorker, I was incredibly impressed  to find such a great Italian restaurant in such an inconspicuous place.    We ended up here on a whim and were beyond pleasantly surprised. We came into an intimate setting where every table overlooks the kitchen.  It's byo which ended well despite the amount of apps we ordered.   The relevant details are as follows: we got the mozzerella, sausage and peppers, crostelle and meatballs apps and everyone agreed to y were incredible. We each ordered different dinner dishes, however, the risotto, chicken parmesan and ravioli were all freshly made and we were so stuffed from apps that we were not able to finish dinner.   By the end of the meal we were so full and spoke with Frankie (ex chef/owner) and learned they had only been open for 3 weeks. We all literally gasped as more than half of us have worked in food service, we knew it takes more than 3 weeks to receive the  service, table side observance of food prep and quality of our dishes to be that pleased.   Overall, all of the ingredients are fresh, Frankie makes the mozzerella fresh daily (among other things including fantastic canollis) and a beyond attentive staff, I look forward to our next visit because not only is the food incredible, but thoughtful and delicious...not to mention that the staff are awesome."}
{"text":"This morning the cook was having a bad day, how hard is it to prepare a hard fried eggs?  The first two times my eggs came to the table as over easy, you know if you were into \"dripping your toast\" over easy? The third time eggs came out with a soft yolk not hard but soft. The pancakes came out flat and greasy!!! The waitress and the guy  in the kitchen washing dishes were both cool however the cook was hot tempered and very rude  to his colleagues. I ordered a  simple dish two eggs, toast home-fries and a choice of meat, in addition two pancakes. The setting was not comfortable I paid my tab and I left and will not return..."}
{"text":"DISASTROUS BRUNCH.  Pittsburgh has a dearth of good places for a straightforward bacon, eggs, toast, coffee kind of brunch that are not Eatn'Park, so we were excited to find Cucina Vitale for brunch a few months ago, and we had a great experience then. The food was good, the price was right, and the service was pleasant.  Today, same waiter and same head cook - it was a disaster. There are only 30 seats in the restaurant, and it seemed that of the two waitstaff, only one (Kevin) was taking orders, and the other woman was mostly standing around and occasionally going around and pouring coffee. Good thing that the coffee was decent. Why? Read on.  Generally, an open kitchen concept is a great way to showcase a skilled and disciplined kitchen team. At Cucina Vitale, it puts dysfunction within earshot and eye contact and creates a dining experience where the kitchen stresses out the diners as well as the staff.  As we waited a few minutes for our table, I heard the cook say to the waiter, \"I don't want to hear it, because you're not back here\" - in the middle of waiting, I heard him say, \"I don't care\" (not anything you want to hear the person who's cooking your food say) - and by the end of the meal (finally) when I went to pay, it was him saying to the desperately overworked waiter, \"What the f#&% are you doing?!\" As a customer, I don't want to, nor should I have to hear this sort of language or see this sort of behavior.  I say \"finally\" because I'm pretty sure that the cook was cooking each order individually, and our entire dining experience for a simple greasy spoon diner brunch took an hour and a half - BECAUSE WE WAITED AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD. Like I said, good thing that the coffee was decent and it was refilled often enough.  None of this was worth it (nor was the cook's attitude necessary) for what's otherwise a simple, standard, classic brunch."}
{"text":"J and I decided to try this little spot near the South Side Works this morning.  The wait was 15-20 minutes for a table of 2.  Not too bad, as J got to smoke.  Once our table was ready, we were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken.  Then the mess started.  I ordered herbal tea, and the small metal teapot for hot water they gave me was warped, causing me to spill hot water all over our table.  After we cleaned up, the waiter came over to take our breakfast orders.  Pretty simple: I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with scrambled eggs, Cheddar, and turkey sausage.  J ordered bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, and homefries.  It took them 45 minutes to bring our food.  Crazy because there were only 6 other tables with guests there.  We noticed that a few other patrons got their food orders late as well.  I looked into the kitchen (my chair was facing there) and noticed one of the cooks on her phone and the other two men engaged in a conversation.  Where was our food? After waiting, they finally brought out our food, which was mediocre at best.  As J would put it, \"We could have made this at home ourselves\".  Worst of all for J? We were there for over an hour and no one offered to refill his coffee, despite a waitress passing our table with a full pot multiple times.  When we got up to leave, we noticed that the 4 people that were seated about 5 minutes after us still were not served.  Needless to say, on to the next one..."}
