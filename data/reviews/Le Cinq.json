{"text":"This club was fun!!! Me and my girl visited this club on Christmas evening, and to my surprise we had an amassing time dancing zouk and compa. But you must go upstairs to the upper level, there you will find lots of couples dancing. I will defiantly visit again.... 10plus clubbing fun!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever received at a club. We bought VIP tickets New Year's Eve that were suppose to include our alcohol. We had to wait in line for over 30 minutes when the door people let people buy their way in. Then when we finally get in the bar tenders would not serve anyone who wasn't tipping enough. Bartenders weren't serving us and we were throwing $20 bills on the bar. It is a nice building but it was absolutely disgusting inside and looks nothing like the pictures on the website. I would never go back to this club."}
{"text":"We prepaid $150 for VIP tickets through TicketZone for their NYE event which was to include some food, open bar and presumably entrance.    We arrived at 10:45pm.  Were refused entrance and told to stand in the only line that wrapped around the block, which was mixed with people who had and didn't have tickets.  The promoter (I assume?) was selling tickets to some larger groups in front of us who didn't have them, and then escorting them through the entrance.  When we asked why we weren't being allowed in, he said we were only two people so he would need to find others to go in with us.  After almost an hour waiting outside freezing (and close to midnight) we asked the promoter what was going on.  He apologized, and then suggested that we give him some cash to give the bouncer to let us in.  Needless to say we left at this point and barely made it back to our hotel in time for midnight.  We've already reported the charge as fraudulent with our credit card and plan to do the same with other review services and consumer organizations.  Would encourage others who were outside waiting with us to do the same."}
{"text":"I went there for an Afro party launched by HaitiMakaya. So would I recommend that event sponsored by them??? NO... Honestly it was more of a Haitian/Hip Hop party than an Afro party so that's that. Now let's move on to the venue I'm giving it a 4 because I didn't taste their food and didn't experience the service provided by the waitstaff. Now the venue itself is quite nice I enjoyed looking up and seeing the lights rhythm ok I know that sounds hella silly but it was cool . The staff that was there at the entrance and the coat check staff were friendly and did performed their jobs accordingly. Totally enjoyed the venue. They have what I suppose were the VIP spots kinda like 2 balconies which I think were well placed. One offered access to the DJ and served as the stage and the other was on the side. So all good all around!!! Definitely would recommend this place for a party and such there is plenty of space to dance whether it be the Cupid shuffle, bump and grind etc.."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The staff were horrendous and very rude. Also, drinks were ridiculously over-priced. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Je l'ai testé en profitant d'une offre groupon Le menu était très original (oursin, os à moelle, etc..), avec beaucoup de plats français Le propriétaire est corse et très sympa, j'ai beaucoup jasé avec lui Il pourra vous raconter les histoires de fantôme qui se disent sur son restaurant... (regardez un peu sur Google pour vous donner une idée...) L'été, c'est très agréable de manger sur la terrasse, qui donne sur la rue animée qu'est De la Montagne Je vous conseille de visiter l'intérieur du resto, qui vaut vraiment le détour! Prix un peu élevés mais je pense que c'est le quartier.."}
{"text":"Beautiful and classic club restaurant right off St. Catherine.   Black cod is a must try."}
{"text":"Came here on the Saturday night of Labor Day Weekend and had so much fun!! I was walking on the street with my friends looking for a place to go and dance when we got approached by Naj (I don't know if I'm spelling that right) who was a promoter for a club and said he could get us into this club for free. We figured we had nothing to loose so he walked us to the front of the line and we got in for free! The inside was beautiful with chandeliers on the ceiling and a huge DJ stage. I think we got there around 10ish so it was virtually empty. I guess the only negative was that I paid $8 for a vodka cranberry and I couldn't taste any alcohol so when I asked them to put in more, it kinda became a big deal behind the bar because I guess if the bartender put more in, she would be loosing money or something like that so she couldn't do it. So we went outside and asked our promoter if we were allowed to leave and come back and he said we could! (unheard of in the States). So we left and drank more and came back at 1am and the place was BUMPIN. dancefloor was nice and packed but not to the point where you couldn't move and the DJ was going back and forth between playing really good hip hop and the freshest house dance tracks. I vaguely remember the light show being really good. The club closed at 3am which is later than what I'm used to so that was good too. Overall, had a great time here :)"}
{"text":"This was the most bullshit of bullshit clubs I have ever been to. My friends and I paid over $300 for the NYE event. Overcrowded, understaffed, and just an overall complete waste of my time. The website said open bar, however we didn't even get any drinks. The bar was crowded with only two bartenders on staff who were too slow. Pushing and shoving our way to the bar, only to leave without drinks. From beginning to the end, it was a complete disaster. Upon getting to the bar, we had to wait for half an hour in Montreal's freezing cold weather before the bouncer let us in. Once entering the club, we had to wait another 20 minutes in the coat check line. Coat check is five dollars which you have no choice but to pay seeing as they won't let you enter the club with coats on. The music was all pop music with no space to dance since the floor was packed with people. I felt like I was at a middle school prom. Overall, we left shortly after New Years without even a drink. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
