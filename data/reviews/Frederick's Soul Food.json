{"text":"tHIS IS ABSOLUTELY A HIT...NOT A MISS.  this food was great and for 5.oo you get wings and a muffin . 9.00 was a complete lie in this first review. the chicken and fish are cooked in separate fryers and if the first reviewer tasted fish on the chicken...smh... it might of been something already on her palette. the corn muffin falls apart because it if buttery and fresh. if she knew about soul food and black culture then she would know the real restaurants don't serve hard dry muffins like  she is used to making at her home with an  inaccurate recipe.
this is the only soul food restaurant downtown and i appreciate them,  soul food is  variable and there are no exact recipes for the southern dishes that everybody prepares.. its your own style and   flavors you bring to the public. if you know soul food then you know methods are handed down from generation to generation.  but i really cant fault the first reviewer because she doesn't know any better"}
{"text":"This place is still new and there might be some growing pains.

I had the 2pc fish and fries lunch and while it was reasonably priced (about $5.50+tax with drink!) was more fries than fish.  The two pieces of fried fish (catfish?) were scrawny and there was very very little meat to eat.

Service was very friendly and the place appears clean and well organized.  The food was cooked fresh to order.

It's definitely a mom and pop shop, but they are seriously lacking in their in-store signage and menus.

You don't know what they have to offer, and it's just not clear to someone who hasn't been there (ie most people when you first open) what options are available. While they have a large menu printed on a large sheet of paper --- it's mounted way too high, and the fonts are way too small.  The printed menu/sheet of paper is too cluttered to be quickly useful. The combos listed don't help.

I think I would have fared better with the chicken and waffles, but for the meal delivered today was definitely not worth more than (2) stars."}
{"text":"My experience with eating soul food out is that it can be hit or miss.  Fredrick's Soul Food is a miss.  The interior of the restaurant is just as formidable as the food.
 
The seating is hard high backed uncomfortable booth seating. 

I  had the fried chicken wings ( 3 wings ) with a corn muffin.  The muffin was not baked long enough and fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  Just three wings and a corn muffin came to over $9.00 a complete disgrace.


My chicken wings weren't the least bit tasty. They came out tasting as if they were fried in the same grease as fish.  I don't want to taste fried fish when I'm eating wings.

The fried fish taste overpowered any seasoning on the chicken.  Undercooked corn muffins and chicken fried in fish grease it's just tacky and unprofessional."}
{"text":"One week after I wrote my initial review, I went back for some fried chicken, and they'd already changed hands. The chef has now taken over the business. I went right at lunch time, hoping for the best, and walked in to find only other customer there.  I ordered the 8 piece chicken, which was supposed to be two breasts, two thighs, two legs and two wings. Got it back to the office, gave the breasts to my co-worker, and then took mine. Instead of two thighs, I had one thigh and one breast (I just am NOT a breast man). And frankly, the chicken was ok, it certainly wasn't as good as the first time I'd tried it.

The place doesn't even seem to have a name yet. At this rate, it may not."}
