{"text":"The price is about the same as Quizinos. The sandwich was great! They have a live musician so it is kind of loud. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The food is good, the staff is friendly it's just a bit on the spendy side but it is really delicious. We go there all the time! I would have to say the best part is their milkshakes. They're made with real ice cream right in front of you and they come with yummy little cookies on the straw. The best is chocolate-peanut butter - banana!!!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER! And for average at best food. I walked in 1st before about 5 other customers and got served last. No apology.....rude employees and the food SUCKED. Stay away from this utter disaster of an establishment."}
{"text":"Potbellies is always delicious! Of course there are training and personnel issues when a shop first opens, but they'll get up to speed quickly. The sandwiches are amazing! So happy to not have to drive to Tempe anymore."}
{"text":"Great salad and sandwich shop in the heart of busy Euclid/4th Street area. Like others have said, the fresh and customizable sandwich and salad options don't feel like a chain operation. Staff is friendly and fast during the busy lunchtime, but tends to be slower at off times. I love the Clubhouse salad with extra chicken--fresh ingredients and packed with protein--and great healthy option. Tip: beat the lines by using their online ordering app. Works great if you work nearby and order ahead."}
{"text":"Hands down, the most disgusting sandwiches we have ever eaten--anywhere. The bread was like cardboard, meat was low quality, and there was nothing really \"on\" it to make it interesting. Just meat and bread, no special sauces or anything. The \"mushroom melt\" was raw white mushrooms and slightly warmed cheese, which was one of the most underwhelming things on earth you could put in a sandwich. I love mushrooms and melts, and this was just a few layers of raw junk brushed under a toaster.

Milkshakes were watery. $17 down the drain."}
{"text":"Usually I do not go out of my way to write a bad review, but my experience at Potbelly today (11:30am) was horrendous.  I have been here several times because I love their sandwiches.  However, every time the service is either bad or just tolerable.

Today I walked in and there was one couple sitting at a table and nobody in line.  The only person behind the counter was on her cell phone.  As I approach, she moved down to the register as not to be bothered.  So I stood there and waited a minute.  Finally, another worker poked her head out from the kitchen and told me to wait and someone would be right with me.

At this point I'm getting slightly irritated wondering what they all could be doing and how this place manages to stay in business.  A few minutes later the same worker that poked her head out asks me what I would like (attitude included at no charge).  

So I stepped down to the next station.  After my sub finished toasting this guy comes out from behind the kitchen.  He was supposed to ask what I would like on my sandwich, but failed to do so.  Instead he made me wait while he prepared things for the lunch rush ahead.  Mind you, the cashier that was on the phone is just standing there doing nothing.  Finally he decides to help me and again does so with an attitude.

A few things Potbelly management needs to take into consideration.  The city of Independence is over saturated with a number of restaurants that take advantage of the business parks in the area.  This type of service will just drive patrons to another sub shop (3 others within 2 block radius).  Hopefully they will get it together."}
{"text":"I went here for the third time today and thought I should leave a review. I like it because the sandwiches taste similar to Quiznos to me, which was my go-to sub place before many of them closed down. Surprisingly, I never have issues with parking here, even during weekday lunches. Also, the staff moves quickly and the food always tastes good. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this shop, the food is amazing, the selection is wonderful, but the service is passable at best. Everyone was friendly, good vibes all around, but the shakes were severely lacking in both thickness and cookie. Unfortunately, I got my hopes up on the wonderful app, and was rudely dissapointed that it did not work. It crashed whenever I try to order, leading to a saddened mood. The lack of sandwich in my stomach made me a sad man. I hope to have to have this resolved soon, seeing as this is the most wonderful artisan authentic mom-and-pop sandwich-eria. I love this place. :)"}
{"text":"Fast and tasty sandwiches, good baked goods and soups, and a wide array of micro-brew-y beverages.

That said, their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly faux-Joanna Newsom-y."}
{"text":"I am writing this review to commemorate my accomplishment of having every sandwich on Potbelly's menu at least once. Yes, yes, please hold down the applause and the cheers. 

While I certainly like some of the sandwiches more than others they are all very good and made with fresh ingredients. I especially like that Potbelly's offers their sandwiches as \"original\", \"big\" and \"skinny\".  I always get an original but we have a big guy or two in the office and they go for the big. If you're on a diet or not very hungry go for the skinny.  They also have a nutrition calculator - just check the boxes for your sandwich ingredients and you'll see a custom nutrition label. Nutrition and allergen sheets are also available.

If you don't want a sandwich you'll also find soups, chili and salads on the menu. Dessert? Yep, they have that too (their cookies are warm and delicious).

Nice lunch spot with a lot of options and very friendly service."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time recently.  I was in the area and all of the other lunch options in that center didn't look appealing to me.

So you don't look like a total newb - you order your sandwich and that person puts the basic ingredients on it, then sends it through a toaster conveyor belt, when it comes out the other end someone else puts your choices of condiments on it, wraps it up and then you pay and either sit down or leave. 

They have a number of choices and it's nice that they list the nutritional details on their menu board. I went with a friend and, totally ignoring the valuable nutritional information, we got the chicken/cheddar and the Italian and shared 1/2 each.  Both were pretty good.  Certainly not the best sandwiches I've ever had but better than Subway by a mile and much much better than a fast food burger.

Two sandwiches, two fountain drinks - $11. Well worth it.

I'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"Great sandwich 
Great Service  
9/10 easy the only reason I can't go 10/10 was because it was a tad hard to find in terms of parking & getting there but definitely worth it. I had the grilled chicken 10/10"}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as some of the reviews are making it out. You have to set your expectations - it's possible that the reviewers didn't know what to expect, as this chain is new to Canada. This place is a sandwich place - a lot like Quiznos or Subway, but it is a more upscale than both of those. The quality of ingredients is certainly far superior - the chicken actually tastes like real chicken here for example. Is it better than Fast Fresh foods next door or Bgood round the corner? Probably not, but it isn't really any worse either. It's good to mix it up and this is another place that offers that.The sandwiches here definitely are not small - even the regular size is decent and comparable with other places.

If you want a half-decent meatball sub sandwich, this is the place. Also you can get pretty creative - the base sandwiches are quite cheap so you can afford to class it up a bit. For example, get chicken breast, freshly sliced avocado and bacon etc. and make a decent tasting club sandwich - total cost for that is probably under $10 - not bad.

The staff here always seem to be pretty friendly to me. Yes you do have to repeat yourself a lot - which is kinda dumb. The process could indeed be a bit better.

They have other stuff like freshly baked cookies. The oatmeal ones are pretty nasty and undercooked/sweet, but the chocolate brownie cookie is just insanely good. I would literally go here just for that one cookie, it's that good.

Overall its like subway/quiznos, but with better quality ingredients - a 'premium sub' place very much like Firehouse Subs in the US or Jimmy Johns. I would go back if I was in the mood for that type of thing and I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest, finding out there was a new Potbelly coming in within easy driving distance was like a gift from the heavens. Potbelly not only has delicious sandwiches, but their shakes are to die for and they come in flavors you dont find all that often. 
The bread the sandwiches come on is delicous, almost like a larger, softer, baguette. The ingredients are fresh and the servers are always friendly (must be a Midwest thing ;) ). My real favorite however is the banana shake, which I have failed to come across really anywhere else. Made with real ingredients to keep out that yucky candy-banana flavor, they are delicious (and if you are on a diet try the smoothie version instead!)
There is something for everyone from giant pickles straight out of the jar to delicious oatmeal cookies that are always soft and taste fresh baked.
Defiantly worth changing up your Subway or Jimmy John's routine for, you'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Time to knock this 4.5 star overall rating down to earth. This place is not very good. I do not have any fond memories of eating this for lunch when I lived somewhere else, like the other reviewers do. Perhaps the nostalgia is clouding judgment.

It reminds me of Which-Wich in the taste and type of sandwich, but with far less options and more expensive for a smaller sandwich. The bread is ok, but not good. Another review mentioned there isn't really anything interesting about the sandwiches and I completely agree. Their signature seems to be milkshakes, but that's sort of a weird thing to have in the middle of a workday during a quick lunch. 

It is new, and it is packed, but the service was very good. The long line didn't take as long as I would have thought, but it still took awhile. 

Overall, this place is ok but not good. It's generic fast food sandwiches that are equal to the plethora of other fast food sandwich options. I would not seek it out amongst others and would much rather have a good Italian deli Uptown to service my sandwich needs."}
{"text":"Hot fresh food that taste good and is reasonably priced. They have very friendly staff and great service. I recommend it"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I moved here from Chicago in '08 and have been missing it ever since.  Love the wreck sandwhich and the dream bar...it is dreamy!!!  I do wish you would get the macaronni salad here and the big sandwhiches, but other than that the menu is fine by me!
I do have to agree that of the 15+ times I have visited this location my order is mixed up at least half the time and they have to make me another sandwhich.  I've tried to cut some slack because they are new, but it would be nice to get a drink on the house just to show that they value my time and are trying to improve on their accuracy.  
I'm still a fan & would reccommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Ate here once after hubby picked up 3 different sandwiches and 3 shakes. Sandwiches were good.  If you like your sandwich toasted, this would be a good place to try.

But the shakes were bad, really bad, really really bad.

Hubby noticed while waiting in line that a customer in the restaurant commented to a worker that she did not like her shake at all.  He didn't think anything about it, maybe she just ordered a flavor she didn't like.  He brought the food home and we ate our sandwiches.  He tasted his shake first (Oreo) and thought it had a strange flavor.  I thought maybe he didn't like it because of some innocuous reason (like they used an imitation brand instead of the actual Oreo brand).  I tasted his shake and agreed.   It was like an \"electrical\" taste.  Like the shake had been forced through a burned out blender motor.  (I'm not saying that's what happened, but that's the best approximation of a taste description I could come up with.  Definitely did not taste like any other food taste I could describe.)  Still, I thought it was maybe just the Oreos (clearly I am biased against something so trashy).   Then I tasted my vanilla shake and it tasted like I just licked a burned out blender motor.  (Again, I've never had to do that, but that is the best approximation of taste that I can come up with.)  

I love ice cream and I love shakes and never ever have I tasted anything like that in ice cream or shakes.  Did not taste like a food item.  

So maybe, Pot Belly had just opened and maybe, just maybe, a blender motor had malfunctioned and we were willing to forgive if they would acknowledge an issue.  When my husband called to tell them (not to ask for a refund, but merely to suggest that they should take a look at their equipment so nobody else has to suffer what we did), he could barely get a word in as the person on the phone was very quick to tell him how delicious and famous their shakes were.  

Hubby had the shakes frozen and was going to take them to a lab to get them tested.  I solved the problem by throwing them away and vowing never to go to Pot Belly again.  At any location."}
{"text":"i am consistently impressed with the Potbelly chain. i used to live off the location near Kierland in Scottsdale and found their service, product and  cleanliness good-to-great. today i tried the Potbelly in my own neighborhood near 24th and Camelback and was pleasantly surprised to find the service, quality and cleanliness was again good-to-great.

first visit to Camelback location:
-was greeted by the first-point-of-contact (the bread guy) professionally.
-the line staff was friendly and fast during the lunch rush.
-turkey sandwich was on-point:
-----bread not made in-house but nonetheless fresh and held the sandwich together well
-----turkey good quality-not the slimy stuff you get at cheap-o joints
-----toppings were of apparent good-quality...tomatoes, lettuce, hot peppers, etc-tasty and fresh
-----it was $6.50ish for a big sandwich, which to me is affordable...if lunch is under $10 to me that means you won

for a quick bite during lunch, this is a good option. approved."}
{"text":"clean. well-run. ample parking. good-quality ingredients. unsweetened iced-tea options alongside the sugar sodas (as well as a stocked drink case w/ bottled bevs). great selection. efficient execution. for fast and affordable lunch it really doesn't get much better than this."}
{"text":"I am a new visitor to Pot Belly.  Pot belly has good sandwiches ... but offers a great, cheerful experience along with the food!  I was waited on by Olivia and Kenan and they were positive and upbeat ... really went the extra distance to serve up a great atmosphere along with the yummy sandwich.  There are several typical chain sandwich shops closer to me ... but potbelly's positivity is rare in the fast food industry, so I will gladly drive a little further.  I have recommended PB to several friends as the \"happy place\" to go to!  Whomever hires here does a great job!  Kudos!  A little pleasantry goes a long way!"}
{"text":"I really like Potbelly's sandwiches.  I used to eat at Potbelly's all of the time when I lived in Chicago so I was very excited when they came to the Cleveland area and it is exactly how I remember it.   I usually get a \"wreck\" but I've tried them all & they're all good.  Try a shake/malt too!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I get the wreck with everything, but all the sandwiches I've had here were good. It's an awesome value. The shakes and desserts are very good too. The only downside for this location is the limited seating and parking. The service is fast and friendly. I'm glad Pot Belly is finally in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to grab a sandwhich when we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm not the only Dave M. Really good Italian sandwich!  Decor and vibes were nice as well, had a guy with a guitar and harmonica singing tunes. No complaints, though I'll reserve the 5 after I've been a few more times."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great most of the time. There are a few who get a little heavy handed with the mayo and mustard, though.  Try the roast beef and provolone on Italian. They sometimes have local musicians playing during the lunch hour...so eat during that time at your own risk!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I got the Italian sub, as I usually get at sub places. Here, though, it was obvious that they use high quality ingredients. The sandwich was packed full of meat and cheese and the bread was the perfect consistency. The line moved quickly thanks to an employee starting to take orders from those in line before they reached the counter. They offer a variety of bottled drinks to fit any taste. I wish I lived in Cleveland just so I could eat here more often! Definitely worth checking out if you like great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly staff.  The only problem is getting in and out of their parking lot with all the construction going on.  Other than that everytime I have went the food is great."}
{"text":"Visited my 1st Potbelly location in DC and thought it was a mom and pop restaurant.  I was actually excited to see them opening here when I came back from that trip.

Simple review - great food and great service. Subway is so bland by comparison, sorry Jared. Try the Dream Bar if you have the room."}
{"text":"I have only had their chicken salad sandwich on multi grain bread with provolone cheese, that I really enjoyed. I have also had their chicken noodle soup which is not bad. They also make homemade fruit smoothies, which I have tried the strawberry & the strawberry banana. I enjoyed both of them. I do find them to be a little pricey, but I do indulge in one once in awhile. Their staff is very friendly and efficient, especially during the busy lunch rush. I definitely need to branch out and try some of their other sandwiches & salads."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place as a name like Potbelly and the nice decor suggests to me that you'll get some unique sandwiches with rich flavors. To my surprise, all i found was a glorified Subway. The vibe is nice by a real bummer when it comes to the menu or flavors."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are off the chain. I had the mediterranean sandwich and it was amazing. So glad to have a Potbelly in Charlotte!!!! Service is amazing too."}
{"text":"BEWARE! Aggressive employees behind the counter. We said hello as we walked in which she ignored(which we were confused by) then she went on to snap at me and my wife and shake her head as we were just trying to order. We were completely thrown off gaurd and have never felt so much anger by someone in a customer service job. Completely unprofessional and during the Christmas season makes it even worse. It's a shame because we used to go all the time. Never again!"}
{"text":"Ordered 10 sandwiches for delivery with a group of co-workers. They were delivered on-time(actually a few minutes early) and everything came out great! Absolutely no complaints, will definitely order again from them, prices are awesome!!"}
{"text":"For our first time experience we give them 5 stars, customer service was great the place was clean and the sandwiches were awesome the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food you get. We will return on a regular!"}
{"text":"Love Potbelly Sandwich Shop, great sandwiches,much better than subway in my opinion.  Only problem, none close to home.  Hope someone brings one to St. Louis."}
{"text":"I work for door dash and I went in to this location pretty late at night with a very large complicated order. The guys who were working that night were VERY helpful and accommodating. In my experience as a door dash driver, when I have to place/pickup complicated orders the employees of the restaurants are reluctant to help me. I was so pleased with the service from the employees working at this store and I appreciate all of their help. I believe one of their names is Easton and I can't quite remember the name of other guy but they really stepped it up, as did the rest of the team when helping put this order together. I would 100% recommend this store to anybody and will absolutely be returning on my own behalf."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place! When I moved from D.C. to Arizona, I was sad to no longer be able to eat at Potbelly ... And then they opened two locations! 

My favorite sandwich is the turkey and I love their salads too. The hot peppers are HOT and I love them! The line always moves really quickly but, as other reviewers have noted, parking in this location can be problematic."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the Uptown salad and it was almost as big ad the tray it came on. We hit the place on a Saturday at 11 AM and we were the only ones there. The gal behind the counter treated us like royalty. 

5 of us ate for around $45, drinks included. The food was tasty and fresh and I really couldn't ask for better service.  The music they were playing was a mix of modern alternative and retro classic rock (late 80s). The place is clean and open and homey. I would definitely come back here when I'm downtown.  Beats the bars and overpriced bistros anytime."}
{"text":"The Italian sandwich was delicious! Warm toasted homemade roll was excellent. People are helpful and friendly. My new favorite sandwich place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad. It didn't seem fresh. The greens seemed old.I won't be going back for a salad if ever."}
{"text":"Seriously good sandwiches.  I had an A Wreck Sub with Roast Beef, Turkey, Salami, and ham for five bucks you kidding me!  Added bacon for $1.25 and it was some of the best bacon I've ever had.  Definitely worth it.  Added all the veggies included their delicious hot peppers.  It's served warm and toasted and is super delicious.  

Really go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Naw. Not really. Same old sandwich shop dime a dozen. I suggest others over this place."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week.  The veggie hummus sub with chicken is great.  Only $5 and tastes great.  Not as large a portion as subway but it tastes way better.  The bread is fresh.  Good strawberry shakes too!"}
{"text":"So good! The mix of the hot bread, meat, and cheese with the cold toppings and mayo is delicious. Perfect place to go when you need a quick bite that isn't the more traditional fast food. Their cookies and bars are addictive. They have lots of fun drinks in a cooler and very good potato salad. A few different flavors of kettle cooked chips. All in all, a great stop for a good sandwich meal."}
{"text":"I have passed by this location several times and decided I should stop in and give it a try. The restaurant has a nice, calm atmosphere with upbeat music that isn't to loud. I ordered a meatball sub and found it quite tasty.  The only drawback is the size. I'm a big guy and a 6 in sub left me hungry for more. Thankfully they had other options available and for me it was the tomato soup. ~$11 for soup, sandwich, and a lrg drink."}
{"text":"Potbelly's is delicious! They are fast and put on whatever you like. The meatball sandwich is so good with hot peppers, cheese, sauce, etc. I could seriously eat that every day and be happy. For the size of the sub I was very happy with the price too! Only like 5 bucks for something that really filled me up. They also have smaller subs for even cheaper."}
{"text":"Cute sandwich shop with really good food and great service. Very friendly and attentive staff. Great shakes and soups too!"}
{"text":"My wife just ordered a salad and about 20% of the spinach and vegetables look totally disgusting. It should have never been put in the bowl.  It took her longer to dig out the bad spinach than to eat the rest of the salad. The manager was very accommodating he said he would take care of it and get her whatever she wanted for just take it off the bill we just had him take it off the bill.  In the companies defence she had eaten at another of their locations and had the same salad and liked it that's why we went back."}
{"text":"First time eating there today for lunch. I ordered the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich all original bread. The sandwich had a good taste however not very much meat. It reminds me a lot of a Quiznos sandwich with less meat. I did also get a oatmeal chocolate chip cookie which was very good. All in all I'd have to say my experience here was a letdown."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but small! We ordered for work over the phone and the employees were very helpful. When we went to pick it up, they had forgotten to put the cookies we ordered in the bag, so one of the guys drove it over to us and gave us a coupon for a free shake! He was super nice. However, back to the food...it reminded me a lot of Quiznos because they toast the sandwiches. Like I said, it was a tiny sandwich, which was a little disappointing. Luckily they are reasonably priced so you aren't getting ripped off, but I would have liked a larger sandwich. This place is good if you just need a bite to eat, but not if you are starving and looking for a big meal."}
{"text":"I love Potbelly's but this location was a bit of a disappointment. The chili was cool-warm and the worker was visibly irritated when I took it back to have it replaced. I got another bowl that was slightly warmer but not hot.
The dream bar was stale and crumbly. 
Sandwich was good. 
Like I said, I love Potbelly's, and I'll try another location."}
{"text":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop is definitely the place to go for a good bite to eat.  I would recommend this place to anyone who is trying to find an alternative to Subway.  People are so used to Subway and it's absolutely mediocre.  Subway is okay but I would basically compare them to McDonald's for sandwiches because there are so many places that are better.  I think people are either clueless or simply don't have a decent set of taste buds.

Potbelly are quality sandwiches and is reasonably priced.  The best places for sandwiches is definitely Potbelly, Capriotti's, and Jimmy John's.  Potbelly is here to stay.  :)"}
{"text":"I went to this Potbelly's in July 2014 and I had a wonderful experience.  The staff was very friendly, my the wreck sub was delicious, and the restaurant was very clean.  Well done!"}
{"text":"This location has never let us down. The service is always fast with extra attention paid to details...tonight was no exception!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, unique sandwiches, nice selection of glass bottle soda, and their Christmas milkshake was fantastic!  Price was fair for what you get.  There is some tough competition in the neighborhood with Capriotti's, Jimmy Johns, and that Which Wich place (haven't been there yet), but I feel like I could hit this place once a month."}
{"text":"My first visit was a pleasant surprise.  Ordered a \"wreck\" sandwich with everything and it was pretty good and fairly priced.  My second visit was pick up at drive thru.  The order was wrong and instead of a turkey and beef sandwich for a person who is intolerant of spice.  I got a spicy Italian sandwich with hot peppers.  The sandwich was pretty much inedible.  In addition to being the wrong sandwich, the filling was rather anemic with only a single layer of meat.  50/50 on experience, not good enough to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Since discovering Potbelly, I will not go anywhere else for a quick sub-style sandwich. They just do everything better then Subway or Quiznos, and by a large margin. 

The meats and vegetables are of better quality and fresher, the bread tastes better, the extras (drinks, soups, chips, cookies. shakes) are tastier and more interesting, and the people are nicer. I have found this to be true at several locations.

They also allow local musicians to play in the restaurants on some designated days. It's a nice thought, but I don't really think it adds much to the restaurant. Points for trying to reach out to the local community, though."}
{"text":"SO FRESH AND DELCIOUS. All sandwiches are made to order and come out toasty and tasty. Very good quality ingredients and fresh. The broccoli cheddar soup is also amazing. Shakes and cookies are DELCIOUS as well. My perfect meal from there includes the wreck sandwich and a Sheila's dream bar."}
{"text":"I got the A Wreck with regular sandwich. It taste awesome, fresh ingredients, bread is toasted just right. Although there's a long line, it goes by really quickly."}
{"text":"Tried the new location on rural and broadway. Service was fast and friendly. Ordered the roast beef and the Mediterranean chicken. Both were really good. Will definitely be going back again to try more."}
{"text":"Agreeing with Gabrielle about the weird set-up and ordering process. You make your order to one person at the beginning of a very tall counter, a second rings you up at the end of the counter, then you go back to the beginning of the counter to order any additional ingredients to the second person. Very awkward.

Great location for picnics at the fountain or on Lake Mendota. It's not as good as what you can make and pack from quality ingredients, but it is convenient. Based on the (new) Mediterranean sandwich I tried, PB's flavors are more intense than Subway's (thanks, in part, to their fantastic hot peppers, which you can get as an add-on, but which might clash with certain sandwiches). My sandwich did seem incredibly greasy, though, especially for a sandwich that was touted as Greek-style. And no, I don't think it was olive oil. The bread was not noticeably different from Subway's. In sum, PB is better than Subway, but only marginally. Potbelly does not really stand apart from the other greasy spoons on State St."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat!

The food here is fantastic! The Grilled Chicken and Cheddar Sub is incredibly tasty, and the service is downright positive and fun!

One of the employees, Dylan, is one of the main powerhouses at this Potbelly's locations. A great attitude all the time, Dylan shows what it truly means to be an excellent employee, and is always on the game!

The food here is very tasty, the environment is up-beat, and they play live music sometimes!"}
{"text":"First time here met with a smile and greeting.  Ordered pizza sub made with quality ingredients. Also ordered turkey and Swiss which is the best I've had. We will be back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Just went to this restaurant. I got their new pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top and it was delicious! To top it off, the employees were so welcoming and friendly! I had begun to believe that customer service was a thing of the past until I came to this restaurant! They are terrific. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE LOCATION!

I went at about 2pm on a weekday and this location was almost empty.  The young man behind the register was picking his teeth with his fingernails when I moved over to pay.  He wrapped up my sandwich (luckily, he was wearing gloves), but when I got back to work, I realized that he had given me the wrong sandwich.  

I called to tell them, and they said that they'd deliver my original sandwich to me at my work (about 30 seconds away).  It took 30+ minutes for them to deliver, and my sandwich was ice cold.  

So, I spent $6 for a cold sandwich (should've been hot), with a messed up order that didn't arrive until 30+ minutes after I left the location.  As a cherry on top, the sandwich tasted like garbage."}
{"text":"I ordered a large order for our company. They were 20 minutes late for delivery and forgot one of our soups. This is unacceptable. Not pleased."}
{"text":"The employee workimng tonight shift absolutely great customer service 
Your customer service is consistent at the 2 locations I've been"}
{"text":"I've eaten at potbelly in other states and always loved the chicken salad sandwich. Went to the drive thru at this location tonight and asked for tomato and no cheese on the sandwich. Got home no tomato and very dry 
I'll go back but a bit of a disappointment"}
{"text":"Mediocre.  We have been a total of three times.  I've tried the meatball sub  and a couple of their salads.  The sandwiches are small (and pricey).  The salads I ordered were made with iceburg lettuce (not called out on the menu), which diminishes any nutritional value for the salad.   I dunno, honestly I can't say much more....the ordering process was quick (but there weren't many people there at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon).  They have an outdoor patio - that was nice."}
{"text":"(EDIT: just realized that they don't even deliver on weekends. So my 2 stars is going down to 1 star. Pitiful. Why even offer delivery, potbelly? Why?????) I eat here maybe once every few months. It's usually good, I've never eaten anything here that I haven't liked. And their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are delicious. One thing that really bothers me (and I know it will never change because probably nobody important will ever see this review) but the delivery minimum is $25. For a sandwich shop. That's INSANE. TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. I've never heard of such a thing. Even chinese places that serve huge portions of semi-expensive food have a delivery minimum of $15. I can't even find anything on the menu I could add on that would make lunch for 1 person $25. I'm stuck here at home with no car and would love to have something other than pizza or Chinese, but I guess my business will have to go to jimmy johns (eh)."}
{"text":"Really good food and service, at a reasonable price. Really liked the chicken & cheddar sandwich. Really tasty!"}
{"text":"After having a few Potbelly sandwiches years ago in DC, I was ecstatic when I discovered there would be one opening within walking distance of my Uptown Charlotte office! So on grand opening day, a few co-workers and I headed over to the new S. Tryon location to try to beat the line. 

We got there at the perfect time (11:10am) right before the line weaved on out the door. We were welcomed by an employee with brownie samples, as well as printed menus in order to start figuring out which yummy sandwich we were going to order. Once we got up to the ordering counter, it was sort of chaotic. The guy taking orders was very upbeat and quick on his feet, which enabled the line to keep on moving. After that it was a little confusing. Being vertically challenged myself, I could not see over the tall shelves which house the chips, and the sandwich maker behind the counter could not see me to ask me how I would like to continue making my sandwich (might have to wear heels next time). After rolling through the toaster, my sandwich was handed off to 1 of 4 people working the next station, where I opted to add lettuce and mustard to my grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich. At completion, my sandwich was handed to me where I took it and my chip bag of choice to the next available cashier. Paying was easy and then I could take my tray over to the drink fountain to fill up my cup (chips and drink were extra, there doesn't seem to be a \"combo\" option). 

My sandwich lived up to the hype, and my co-workers seemed to be genuinely surprised by the quality of food as well. We chose to dine in and sit along the stylish Charlotte skyline bench, and enjoy the live music that was being played inside the restaurant for the grand opening. Right after I had finished my delicious lunch that I had been waiting months to have, the owner of this new location came around and asked us about our food and experience. He was very attentive, and genuinely interested in our opinions, and even offered to take our trays back for us.

This new Charlotte, NC location did not sacrifice the food quality that Potbelly has to offer, and I'm excited to have this new spot on the convenient stretch of S. Tryon St through uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hum, If you are expecting an AMAZING sandwich...try some place else. Potbelly is just another quiznos-esk sandwich shop. Nothing unique, nothing special other then live music."}
{"text":"I have never written a yelp review, but my experience was so over the top amazing, I couldn't resist! I was visiting from California and chaperoning a group of volleyball girls while they played at Phoenix Convention Center. I was In charge of all their meals. It was a daunting task. I desperately wanted food delivered and had trouble finding a place to deliver to the convention center. The Potbelly off McDowell was SO accommodating. I owed it to the manager Kristina. Although delivery was not available, Kristina offered to bring the food on her way home from work! She carefully marked all 10 food orders with each of the girls' names, every order 100% accurate and even took all the salad toppings in separate containers for my more picky eaters. She kept in touch via text so she could easily deliver to me. She honestly made my day and I was so impressed. The best part was, it was evident she was doing this out of the goodness of her heart. Best service I have ever received!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich very reasonable and fast the name seams a little strange didn't know what it was but when I stopped in I was pleasantly surprised great for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"I just love this place!  The staff is always friendly and accommodating! My sandwich is always made to order to perfection!  The restrooms and store are always clean which is a big plus!  The chicken salad is divine!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich joint! Definitely recommend the turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"How fantastic! A must-go for the weekday lunch routine!

Battling a massive hang-over that pretty much destroyed my entire Monday, I went to Potbellys because 1. I couldn't make a lunch for myself when I woke up and 2. a sorority sister of mine mentioned she'd been craving it. So naturally these two factors helped me decide where to go.
If you've ever been to a Picklemen's, you're going to love this place. Literally the exact same set up inside. Tables, ordering, menu, drinks... it's all the same but the sandwiches are bigger and less expensive. I went on a wild limb and orded the smoked turkey. The menu is slightly limited but the items they do have and true crowd pleasers. Was unaware the sandwich was served with bacon too... best surprise ever.
I recommend the low-fat Italian dressing because it's simply amazing. Ask for it on the side so you can dip your sandwich in it. Only paid about $5 for the sammy and I was quite pleased with everything."}
{"text":"Great place! I came in with a large group and they were very good at getting our food to us quickly, even though it was pretty busy at the time. The sandwiches were fantastic and the service was excellent. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Some very nice work done on the store interior - a very welcoming environment, however, this is just another take on the Quiznos toasted sub idea.  (noting that a Quizno's store went under just a block north about 6 months ago).  With so many above par options in the financial district, I regret to have to say that this just a very average toasted sub fast food option in a very competitive market.  (even the nearby Hudson's Bay has far better on-site toasted sub and Panini options on the first floor)

I had the roast beef.  I suggest you don't - the meat was tasteless.  No  Aioli, no pesto, nothing except plain mayo and basic mustard as choices.  Don't expect medium rare thick cut perfection - these guys serve well done (almost grey), thinly sliced beef. Even their \"large\" sub isn't large - at least Subway (and Quiznos, while it was in business) gives you 12 inch, baked in store bread.  No such luck here - their \"large\" is 9 inches and their bread isn't baked on site.  The only thing large was the price.

I give them 9 to 15 months.  

Very forgettable."}
{"text":"Food was made to order.  Some suggestions were made, the was good and the customer service was excellent.  The staff is not afraid to engage its patrons with some small conversation topics.  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"If you want your order to be wrong, then go to this Potbellys.  I have ordered there 5 times - 3 times the order was wrong.  When I called to complain, the individual that answered the phone thought it was funny and I asked to speak to the manager.  I did receive two free sandwich tickets and again the order was wrong.   Too bad - good concept compared to Subway, but can't seem to make the sandwich per what is ordered."}
{"text":"Had a grilled chicken with cheddar. It was decent but nothing to brag about. Staff was friendly, place was clean however I probably would not go back if I was in the mood for a sub. It's a knock off of Quiznos,s . Your better off going to jimmy johns or dibellas"}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible customer service. Katie, who I believe is the manager, is pretty friendly and you can tell she really picks up the slack for her staff. I went in for my second time to Potbelly's and will probably never return just because of the service. I came in, walked up to the register to order and the tall, black, young gentleman was leaning against the back counter didn't say hello to me, but instead gave a head nod to me to direct me back to the end of the counter to order. How difficult would it have been to simply say, \"Hello, how are you doing today? Please move back down to the start of the counter to order\". How hard would that have been? Again, it was my second time in and I wasn't aware of the ordering process. Katie made my sandwich since he was of no help. He wrapped my sandwich and Katie checked me out. There was never a, \"Have a great day, thanks for stopping in\". Nothing. When the food is decent, customer service has to be exceptional if you want repeat customers."}
{"text":"Just got of the phone with the rudest manager I have ever spoken to in my history of placing orders through yelp. I placed an order through their yelp delivery service and called about an hour later to check in status of order. I spoke with a cashier whom explained that they didn't had a delivery person that day and didn't see an order placed by me. I said I placed through yelp service. She said she would ask her manager to talk with me. I was polite the whole time, didn't even asked to speak with manager just wanted to know what happened to my order. Manager gets on the phone and says \"first of all, I don't even know what this yelp thing is and we don't even work with them\" if you don't then please remove the partnership you have with app. I asked if my order was not going to be filled by restaurant then who would refund me for the almost 36 dollars I paid to get delivery. I received a snarky response from her \" I guess that would be yelp\". I will not tolerate being treated like this much less by a business that is supposed to be providing a service. Her employees are way more professional than she is."}
{"text":"Went on the night of a major concert, so there were lines and crowds everywhere, but the staff was super friendly, the wait time was next to nothing, and the sandwich (chicken salad) was fantastic.  Go here."}
{"text":"I like all the sandwich choices they offer here. My favorite would be the Mediterranean with the hummus and roasted red peppers. There b is seating both inside and outside and the decor is nice as well."}
{"text":"Is it a chain? Yes. Are there better options on Green Street? Maybe, but Potbelly is quick, delicious and cheap. I always get the regular roast beef on wheat, and the sandwich is big (probably about 8 inches) and filling. Plus, it's only $5 (I think $5.03 now) but it's hard to beat for the price. 

The place tends to get crowded around lunch (the lines can be Chipolte long occasionally) so I normally go in at either 11 when they open or 1:30 after the lunch rush. And the sandwiches are so good I plan my lunch schedule around those times."}
{"text":"I was very pleased! It's dinner time and a little busy, but the two employees got their routine down! Super friendly employees, and very helpful! The food was good! I got the meatball sub and it was on point! The soup was nice and hot with good flavor! And to end it, the Oreo shake was great!"}
{"text":"Every time I go into the Gilbert location, I'm greeted by enthusiastic employees. They're always friendly and eager to answer any questions. This is a great place to go and have a great meal while casual dining. By the way...their cookies and milk shakes are wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place basically feels like an indie version of Panera Bread (sandwiches, soups & chips). I was there during lunchtime, so I don't know how it is in the evenings. 

I'd have given them 3,5 stars, if it wasn't for their prime, comfy location that gets plenty of daylight unlike 80 percent of the places to eat here; which mostly consist of Five Guys, college-campus-y Mediterranean and ethnic food restaurants and super dark indie-looking places. And, yes, they do have very clean and well-kept restrooms, which is actually my hidden criteria when I'm judging a place. 

It was my first time visiting Madison and I only had couple of hours here. So, I decided to visit the most famous street in the city; State St., which is basically a 6-blocks-long main commercial street between UofW campus and the State House. 

Initially I actually avoided Potbelly... I did my research on Yelp and  was planning to go to completely different places in that area, but when I actually drove by the couple of the highly recommended ones (e.g. Fugu Asian Bistro) and I realized that they were mostly on isolated side streets etc. 

So, my time was running and I saw many people inside this place and it was right around the corner of one of the main intersections on State St. so I decided to give it a try and I'M ACTUALLY VERY GLAD that I did! Yes, their sandwiches are not 'out-of-the-world' amazing. But, I had a pretty satisfying tomato soup + veggie panini + local brand chips for $8! And, there was live music too! 

I'm sure Madisonians and students know much better than a first-time visitor, but I really didn't experience anything wrong here. It was all what I was looking for: a healthy, quick, sit-down lunch with an indie atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came into Potbelly for the first time about an hour or so ago. My experience was so good I just had to jump on here and rave! I was warmly greeted by every employee and immediatley asked if I had been in before. With the guidance of the employees I ended up getting the \"Wreck\" toasted which was AMAZING! I will never go to Jimmy Johns again. Customer service and quality..A++!!"}
{"text":"Love this location. Zack (Zach) was a doll! He was so polite and friendly. Great customer service, I always like to write reviews for people that truly go above and beyond to make a customers experience the best."}
{"text":"Yummy stop while in Uptown Charlotte. Staff was really friendly even though it was very busy. First time here, but not our last!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Potbelly. Both times I've great service and delicious sandwiches. I like that they toast their subs. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Quick service. Quality sandwiches. Smoothies. Many bottled drink choices. Try the grilled chicken and cheddar on multi grain! Pineapple coconut smoothie was excellent. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Zapps chips! \"A Wreck\" sandwich was great. Great price for just the right amount of food."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT. It's my favorite. But I just came to Yelp to downgrade because one of the ladies who make sandwich sometimes hears my request wrongfully, like right now. It's not my pronunciation. I clearly said \"Lettuce, Onion, Tomatoes, please.\" and she gave me the sandwich with lettuce only. She heard and memorizes only one short word. :/ :/ It was to go, so I was not able to claim right there. I don't like the fact that we cannot easily see how they make the sandwich. (they just blocked the view, except for a super tall person)
Everyone, double check and triple check your order, especially toppings!!"}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place-I always get the \"Mediterranean\" which has feta, spicy hummus, and I get tomatoes and oil on it-totally delicious.  My husband gets the \"Wreck\" which has deli meats like salami and he's obsessed.  The kids get the PB&J but you have to ask for them not to run it through the grill.

Their sugar cookies are the best and their shakes are delicious but I think they must be super bad for you.

All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband was in hospital around the corner when I found this super good place.  They also deliver, even to the hospital."}
{"text":"So great that Potbelly has opened in Phoenix.  We sadly left Potbelly behind in Chicago and have missed it.  Great sandwiches - great cookies - great shakes - better than all of the other chains around town!"}
{"text":"The food was average. I will not ever go back because customer service was horrible. There was this bald guy who was really rude to me and my friend today and seem as if he hated his job. If he the manager (not sure if he is one). He should work on his customer service skills."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order with the app at around 3 PM and it was changed to the next day. Called the store to hear that they don't deliver in the evening. I requested to cancel the order and the manager said that I wouldn't be charged yet I still was. They can never get anything right...even in my previous visits. Update: Almost a week later, no refund. Management at this location is terrible."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! I'm addicted to these sandwiches. They are the perfect size, not too big. But if you need a bigger sandwich, they now offer that! Hands down, my favorite sandwich is \"A Wreck\" meats and cheeses and the hot peppers are to die for! 

Their cookies are delicious and homemade. And they have delicious shakes too. 

They are always super fast and the people are really friendly. 

I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I placed an order here for November 13th. It was a catering order for about 80 people. The person I spoke to advised me how much soup to order for my event, needless to say the amount he suggested was not enough. I also asked him to have all of the soup placed in little bowls for easier distribution and they did that with some of the soup but still gave me a big box with a ladle which I specifically asked that they not do. All in all, the food was good and everyone was pleased with the food, however my attendees were a little bummed about not getting soup. I also requested that I be emailed a final confirmation and receipt, I never received that email. My order was also transferred to a different store and I never received notification of that, I found out on the day of the event. I usually love Potbelly's but this experience made me feel a little disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't even remember what sandwich I ordered it was that mediocre. What I do remember is that 

1) the bread was incredibly greasy on the outside. I toasted it but you can do the same thing at Subway without that result. 

2)I wish I had ordered Jimmy John's or Jersey Mike's. 

No issues with service, but not coming back."}
{"text":"I usually give a place at least two tries before writing a review. After yesterday I can tell you that my second visit to potbelly will be my last. I couldn't honestly tell you what I had the first time so it must not have been that great. I think it was their roast beef sandwich. Ya. It's all coming back to me now. Now that I remember how dry it was, just like what I had yesterday. I decided to give the chicken and cheddar a chance. Bread: dry
Meat: dry
Lettuce: dry
Service? You guessed it. DRY. 

Would I recommend this to a friend? No
Will I be back? No way. 

This place is only getting two stars because of its location."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times so far and each experience has been a bad one. First off, they have like 20 people working in such a small area and it feels like when I ask for something, everyone just looks at the other like they are going to do it. Also, even though their sandwiches are good, they are sooo overpriced. Also, each time I have gone in there, I have asked for a malt. I don't understand how it is sooo hard to make a malt. Every malt I have received is like half full. For some reason it is very hard to make a correct size malt or shake. My most recent trip was pretty bad as well. Someone behind me asked for a shake, I had asked for a malt. Well they gave my malt to the shake guy and then when they created the shake, they realized they made a mistake, but then tried to cover it up and secretly give me the shake. Well this was the tipping point because it seems they can never get it right. I'm not going back there. It's too bad because their malts are pretty good. Please get better employees."}
{"text":"Really excellent service from Kristian. She was efficiently and politely running the front of the store by herself. She still went out of her way to get exactly what I wanted on my sandwich and offer me a larger back so that I could consolidate what I was carrying. Many thanks for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Service is impeciable! Over the top even! The staff literally could not be any nicer and more attentive. The long lunch line was completely worth the wait. The sandwich was fresh and toasty but warm chewy all at the same time. I am really glad they are here and cant wait to go back for some more! I had the wreck today it was great! I will try the pizza sub next!"}
{"text":"I don't feel like it's even fair to compare Potbelly's to Subway, Quiznos, and Jimmy John's. The sandwiches here don't taste like chain store quality, even though they are priced cheap.

Probably the only place on green street I would always want to go to for lunch."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new today so we decided to stop in at Potbelly. I ordered the smoked ham with hot peppers, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was very tasty! They did add a little too many peppers so next time I'll be sure to say \"lite peppers.\" I also ordered a strawberry banana smoothie which I absolutely loved! They were nice enough to blend the two as a custom order for us. The customer service was great! We were in and out (it was too early for a dinner rush but too late for lunch). At the checkout counter I decided to grab an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. It was ok, the chocolate chips were kind of overwhelming. All-in-all the food was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food we had a Roast beef sandwich with added avocado and a clubhouse salad.  Nice people and clean."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches!!! I would take this any day over subway! So far every sandwich I have tasted has been great and they have great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Don't ever use this location for catering. I asked for my order to arrive between 11:15 and 11:30. At 11:33 I call to see where my order is. No one answers the phone for a good 5 minutes. I finally get someone and they say they are just finishing up my order. So that means at around 11:40 they were still working on an order that should've arrived at 11:15-11:30. They told me they would try to get it here by 11:45-12:00. The order finally arrived at 12:10 after I had to call again to see where the order was. It was missing items and the delivery person had to go back to the store to get them. If you can't handle large catering orders during a lunch rush don't agree to do them. Simple as that. Or at least let your customer know that the order will be running late. Keeping people in the loop would be a common courtesy. The manager should have been on the phone right away with me. I was told that the manager would call me back after the lunch rush dies down. I understand you get busy but this makes me feel as if my order is less important that the dine in orders. Not impressed at all with this location."}
{"text":"I did order two sandwiches online but it was not even looked at until I reached there to pick them up after 45 mins. I cancelled the order and returned home . They need to figure out what's wrong with online order processing."}
{"text":"good food made quickly... once you figure out how the place works. I'm from out of town and was not familiar with how it worked. it's just a fancy Subway. If I came to Cleveland more often, I'd certainly frequent this place. 
Prices also not very clearly marked."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ordering at this shop. I was unfamiliar with the ordering system, thought I got to order at the cashier first then wait for the food to be prepared. I went for the cashier and ordered for a chicken and cheddar sandwich, the guy behind it was on his phone and showed more than impatience on his face, he was like no you don't order here, don't you see what those people lining up for? He referred to the people who have been waiting at the food prep session. Ummm don't throw ur bullshit at me hey, you don't talk to your customer like this cmon. I don't see myself coming back to this shop."}
{"text":"Is six inches enough for you?  The quality is there, but delivering it is something else entirely.

A new store opened near me, so I finally decided to give them a try.  They offer six inch \"gourmet\" sandwiches for around $5-7 (with tax), no sides included. 

For my first test, I went simple with the Italian and the Meatball sandwiches.

Now the meatball sandwich was hot with melted cheese, but the amount of sauce was seriously lacking, coming across as no more than a simple condiment.  The meatballs were flavorful, but dry, and the pitiful amount of sauce supplied could not even begin to bring these things back to life. You could tell the \"meatballs\" had never even touched the sauce before they came together in the sandwich.  I can't tell you if this is normal, since it was my first visit, but the attempt was not good enough to get me back..

The Italian was a failed attempt altogether, and I will clearly blame the preparer, and not the restaurant.  As in most sandwich places, as you move down the line, you are asked what you would like on you sandwich.  I told him, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, oil and herbs, which he repeated back to me to confirm.  The problem was when I got home the only one of the ingredients that made it to my sandwich was lettuce.....NO tomatoes, onions, pickles, oil or herbs.  I had places that made mistakes with my order, however not this bad, and not with me standing right there at the specific time telling him what to put on the sandwich.  Maybe that is why the condiment area is hidden behind a wall, so you can't see what they are, or are not doing.

First impression...not impressed with either food or staff..."}
{"text":"If you want cheap and delicious food, go to Simply Greek right next to Mitchell's Ice-cream. Food and service is way better.. 

Service is garbage. I think they changed the staff since I've last been here (THANK THE LORD). But the manager and one of the workers straight up yelled at my friend because she complained about not getting her sandwich... Honestly, she wasn't even being that rude- my friend naturally has a kinda whiny voice and her foreign accent may have made it seem like she was upset, but she was never trying to be rude.

My friends and I were just talking and the staff were screaming while pointing in our direction, but we literally had no idea that they were screaming at us at first... then they continued to do jab their fingers in our direction and like yelled while staring at us so I asked her if she was speaking to us. They were literally SCREAMING at her so I stepped in and started debating (I was calm and respectful; they were still yelling her brains out like an uneducated, low class person). I told her that my friend had no intentions of being rude and apologized if she came off that way because it was totally unintentional. Even one of the staff apologized to us because he thought she was being ridiculous and didn't understand why things escalated so much. But the manager continued to humiliate us in front of all the customers. 

I reported this incident online months ago, and asked them to even check the tapes because it'll be quite clear who the victims were. But they never got back to me. Not even ONE message. 

Awful customer service. Never stepping into a Potbelly, and telling all my friends to stop going to his nasty place."}
{"text":"Visited Potbelly on a Saturday around 12:30PM.
Skip to the last paragraph for the short and sweet review.

I've seen this place a few times and finally had a good opportunity to stop in and grab a to-go order.  I like the name and figured it would be average (worst case), but hopefully I would be surprised.
This location shares a building space with Starbucks.   Although parking is a bit limited I found a space straight away.
I found the decor warm and inviting.  It smelled of toasted bread, a plus in my opinion.
After a short wait for two people ahead of me a very pleasant and friendly person, Ann I believe, took my order.
I ordered a tuna salad sub on multigrain bread as well as one of their signature sandwiches called \"A Wreck\" on their white bread.   I also substituted cheddar cheese on the wreck and no cheese on the tuna salad.  They toast their sandwiches, so into the toaster they went.  When they come out the other side you can ask to add your choice of condiments. I asked for lettuce, tomato and onion on both, with some Italian seasoning on the Wreck. 
I added some Zipps kettle chips (delicious chips made in Louisiana) and a sugar cookie.
My bill came to a total of $13 and change.  Most of the sandwich options are around $5.
I was in and out in under 10 minutes.
Arriving home I tried half of each sandwich along with the BBQ Zipps chips and found everything to be pretty good.  The bread toasted up nicely, leaving a crusty exterior.  Based on the price, I felt the sub had adequate amounts of ingredients.  There were options on the menu for extra meat and the like.  The sandwiches themselves were around 7 inches.

Although it was not mind blowing or life altering...I mean, it's a sandwich shop for Pete's sake!  The place was nice, clean and had a pleasant and friendly staff.  Service was quick and efficient.  The food was good.  Would I go back again? Yes."}
{"text":"Love Potbelly. Hate this franchise. Meat was low quality.  Unclean facilities. Not Potbelly quality at all. Need new management."}
{"text":"Got the \"a wreck\", 1 slice of each meat... Are y'all putting me on a diet? Ordered custom to add mustard, got dijon mustard which I'm not a fan. This will be the only time I eat here, there are way too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"i really enjoyed this place.  not a ton of seating, but definitely more spacious than your typical sandwich spot.  had the chicken salad.  on a scale of 1-10, i'd give it an 8.  really enjoyed the decor and \"chill\" atmosphere.  will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the service.. The people of potbelly are so sweet. They actually make you feel like family, as weird as that sounds. Service with a smile is hard to find these days & their sandwiches rock. Waaaaaay better than Subway and Jimmy johns :)"}
{"text":"Decent but disappointing.  This place is a Quizno's knock-off.  No reason to pass a Quizno's, a Firehouse or a Jimmy Johns to get to Pot Belly Sandwich Shop.  Certainly better than Subway but nothing special, really."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is great, the line moves fast and it is so cool to see a place that finally is smart enough to offer coke and Pepsi.  That said, they could use a spicy mustard option and banana peppers.  They only offer yellow mustard and hot peppers, which seems a little short sighted considering how well conceived everything else about  this chain is."}
{"text":"Eh. I'm not sure if this is still a part of their soft open, or what, but the training department needs to get serious over there. There were easily 6 employees behind the line and I am pretty sure there sole purpose was to confuse the living daylights of each other. Communication was a foreign word. We were given two different people's orders, there is no order put in the computer as it's made, so by time you get to the cashier they are trying to figure out what your ordered and it's just painful. 

The food itself was equally as lackluster.  Don't bother clicking the menu button here on Yelp, half of the items this location doesn't offer.  I ended up getting a chicken and cheddar sandwich. They chicken was the fake grill line kind, I'm not sure how long it's been since it was a bird. The cheddar was barely there, I would say only four bites had cheese on it. You have the option of adding toppings from an exceptionally confused young lady, nothing special, nothing that offered any added zing to the bland sandwich. In fact, oddly enough, I added lettuce to my sandwich and that is the only thing I ended up tasting....iceberg isn't supposed to add flavor. Hmm oh.  The hubby got a loaded potato soup, not sure where the loaded part came from. No chives, cheese, bacon, or sour cream in sight. This soup literally tasted like starch. Their soda station is crammed in a corner. There is not enough counter space to put your cup down to put a lid on, you have to use the side of the cashier's counter. Can't imagine the place during the rush times with more than one person trying to fill a drink at a time.

I like that they have nutritional information posted, helps to verify you're clicking the right thing in MyFitnessPal. I like that this side of town is finally getting new things. ....that's about all I liked about my visit last night. 

I've been to another location in the valley and was only ever so slightly more impressed. So one more try to find something worth the money and calories and I'm done with Potbelly."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches, Mediterranean & the wreck are my favorites. Great place."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Very casual atmosphere with amazing service. I had the turkey and Swiss on multigrain and it was truly tasty. I love that they toast all of the sandwiches unless otherwise requested not to. I paired my sandwich with a cup of their house made loaded potato soup and it was something to write about. Delicious! You'll be seeing me again soon Potbelly!"}
{"text":"There are a couple vegetarian friendly sandwiches. My favorite is the Mediterranean. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, and the décor is even better! I had a turkey club with hots. The hots are really good here and I got them in the mac n cheese. The staff was friendly. I also really LOVE all of the photos from the WI Historical society on the walls. Check on the really cool one in the back hall of three people ice skating. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the toasted sandwiches at Potbelly.  High quality meats and perfectly toasted bread make for a very delicious sando!"}
{"text":"Having just moved back to Phoenix, I was glad to see that they opened a Potbelly on Camelback. I have loved Potbelly since I was a kid, when my family and I used to frequent the original sandwich shop on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. While I think they are still working on establishing the menu (I asked for their chicken and cheddar sandwich and they weren't serving that yet), this Potbelly succeeds in meeting the same high standards as all of the Potbelly locations I have enjoyed back in my hometown. I ordered their turkey and Swiss cheese, with lettuce, tomatoes, oil, and Italian seasonings, and I was relieved that they serve Chicago-style giardinara (hot peppers) at this location, too, and so I added extra hot peppers, all on toasted whole grain bread. It was delicious. I also used to order their meatball sub with hot peppers, which is also very good. I didn't get the chance to see if they serve breakfast, but Potbelly's breakfast sandwiches are great. When I used to fly a lot, I would order their bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sub at Midway Airport, with mushrooms and hot peppers, and it was always excellent. Anyway, I am glad to have another piece of Chicago right here in the Valley!"}
{"text":"A quick break before the game. They are still open even after 4 pm because today is a game day. Liked the deco & coffee milkshake."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped by Potbelly this morning during the eclipse and had a wonderful experience. The entire staff at Potbelly is incredibly kind and thoughtful. A true neighborhood friendly lunch place. This place has a great atmosphere and we will be coming back. Strawberry banana smoothies are delicious!"}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! WOW! If you've  never experienced the delicious potbelly Sandwich then it is a must do for all you so much lovers. I highly recommend the WRECK!!! Light mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes. Oh, and don't forget to add the hot peppers. The hot peppers are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Walked all the way from the A concourse to try this place. I had the turkey club and it was delicious.  Fast service too. The hot pepper mix is excellent if you like that sort of thing. It doesn't come on the sandwich, you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers,
I LOVE THIS PLACE! the sandwiches are amazing, I hate when people say Subway or Quiznos is better, it's not! This place is so delicious and always made my sandwiches so perfect! I always get \"A wreck\" tastes like heaven and the people are always sweet. Try getting a pickle on the side. I'll definitely visit more and more."}
{"text":"Nice simple menu. Sandwiches arent too funky or fancy. The staff was nice and friendly. The place has good comfortable design.

However, the prices aren't the cheapest. A 6inch sub with water and a small pack of chips was $15. Basic toppings only include lettuce and tomatoes. Cucumbers were $1.50-2 extra. Im assuming other toppings cost extra as well.

Sandwich tasted ok, nothing special. Not my first choice. Would rather dine at a Subway."}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian sandwich I've ever had anywhere, especially when on wheat bread. Seriously, order the Italian, it's so good I rarely try anything else!

And it's dirt cheap, $4 a \"normal\" sub."}
{"text":"Potbelly used to be my go-to when I lived in the states for some good & quick sandwiches and i was SO happy to see that they made it to Toronto!! There aren't that many options to choose from -- mostly just cold meat-based(i recommend the wreck or the italian!!). The concept is similar to subways but much better quality. You choose the sub you want, then the toppings you want on them. I highly recommend their hot peppers!! They also have salads, shakes, malts, and cookies. I didn't try the shake at this location, but I used to get the oreo one all the time -- it is very good.. but how can you go wrong with oreos and ice cream.. ever??
The location is cute -- very roomy and nicely designed. I went in the afternoon so it wasn't busy. The people are friendly and the service was pretty fast. Overall, a great place for a quick lunch. They also have breakfast options that look pretty good (breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal..etc), but I haven't tried them yet!"}
{"text":"Damn am I excited this place is finally in AZ!!!!  And I didn't even experience any sort of newly-opened growing pains on my first visit!

When living in DC I ate Potbelly (mushroom melt, extra hot peppers!) a few times a week.  Finally, the deliciousness has arrived in the Valley!

Great chocolate chip cookies as well - prepare to be the 'hit' at the office if you are so kind as to bring some to work.   I've never had their shakes but I know they have quite a following...  They also have convenient and VERY affordable catering that we used often in DC for meetings, but I haven't tried it here.

Affordable. Delicious.  Friendly, welcoming staff.  And the perfect vegetarian sandwich."}
{"text":"This is very delicious food. The people are friendly. It was great. To get into the place, you have to approach it from the side. Even though there's a sign that says the sidewalk is closed, it is possible to get into the place. Approach the place from  sixth Street. I had the chicken and cheddar grilled sandwich."}
{"text":"Meh. Never been here before and ordered the turkey club Bigs....thought that meant extra meat or something but no. Flavors were okay but for $8.60 i figure that deserves to be at least a 12\" sandwhich with extra meat. People were nice enough but with a bad location and parking lot ontop of not feeling i got my monies worth we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty unimpressed by this place. I went here just to try it out (usually like Dibellas, almost next door). I had a hard time finding something that looked appealing on their menu... The menu is very small. Once I finally ordered I was disappointed by the choices of toppings and what not. Again, not much variety. I ended up getting a flat bread...it was very generic tasting. The boy who helped me was very nice but the female manager basically reamed him out for a small error in front of me and it made me feel really uncomfortable. He was clearly new.. The mistake did not warrant such a reaction. Anyway... There's tons of sub options in mayfield.. And I will probably go back to Dibellas or even Penn station."}
{"text":"I love Potbellys and it kills me to have to give them a 1 star. This star is not based off of the food - that was wonderful per usual, but this review is due to the guy that was rude to me for no reason. Normally customer service is great. I have been to this particular establishment many times during lunch as I don't work far and have always been treated with a smile, asked if I would be dining in and if not they bagged the food for me. Tonight was a different story. I walked in around 7:45pm, they close at 9. It was empty, except for the 3 workers. One individual named Morgan who helped me, was completely standoffish. I have never been treated with such disregard before. Not a smile, not asking if I was dining in; I bagged my own food and then when I asked if there were any oatmeal CC cookies left his response was - we close in an hour. I then proceeded to joke with him, which he clearly did not find amusing. Maybe it wasn't his sort of thing he would find funny (tried to get the 12 pack of mini oatmeal CC cookies for the price of a cookie), but I know with my many years in the customer service field - you laugh and make light of the situation. 
Basically you can go to this place for food - just hope and pray you don't have to deal with Morgan. He was rude, disrespectful and standoffish."}
{"text":"I usually avoid Potbelly just because I'm not overly excited by their menu and the line is usually long and moving slowly.  I stopped in to pick up some sandwiches on Saturday because I knew it wouldn't be crowded.  I had to wait 5-10 minutes before anyone took my order, which didn't bother me much because it took me a while to figure out their chaotic menu boards.  The server was very nice and apologetic and gave me my sandwiches for free, which I think qualifies as better-than-expected service.  

The two sandwiches I got seemed pretty small considering their prices.  If the ice cream sandwiches they have advertised for $2.85 are actually made with the cookies they have displayed (at least 5\" diameter), they must be an excellent value."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype for this place. 

The sandwiches are cheap, sure, but what do you get? Couple slices of deli meat crushed between two thick loaves of puffy sub bread. When I want a sub, I'm there for the meat - not the bread. 

Is it better than Subway? Yes. But most places are better than Scrubway. 

Potbelly's is Jimmy John's subs with a toaster oven. 

Cafe Rio next door is far, far better and only a few dollars more."}
{"text":"I tried Potbelly for the first time last night when we decided to use them to cater an event at church.  I had heard only good things about them and their prices were reasonable, so we gave it a shot.  My goodness deliciousness.  The sandwiches were delicious; they had great flavor and were very fresh.  If that wasn't enough, they were so great to work with.  We'll definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I eat the sandwiches here often - they are good quality, decent size, and reasonable price.

One time I really wanted soup. I thought 'hmm, potbelly probably has good soup!' I checked their online menu and saw a decent soup selection, and was particularly interested in the 'loaded potato.' Unfortunately the ingredients aren't listed online (anywhere easy that I could find) so I thought I would go in and ask what was in it.

I went in, got in line, and asked the lady when it was my turn 'what is in the loaded potato soup?' Her response was 'potatoes'. I asked for a bit more detail. She replied that there was a full ingredients list downstairs but it was busy at lunch time and she couldn't go down and get it for me at the moment.

How are the only two options for explaining a menu item either the first ingredient or the entire ingredient list? How is there no in between? I can't imagine going into any other restaurant, asking 'whats in item x', and getting either a 1 or all ingredient answer. I was hoping for the next few ingredients (after 'potato', which was obvious from the name of the soup), to get a sense of what it would taste like. Surely potato wasn't the only main ingredient, because that would just be mashed potatoes, or just...potatoes in water? And 'loaded potato'...what is the potato loaded with! I would have thought a quick glance into the container of soup would have revealed the 2-3 next most common ingredients.

Anyways I ended up ordering the chili, and when I got back to my office and realized they had given me the thai curry instead, which was disappointing, but still quite yummy."}
{"text":"First time in tasted fabulous very friendly staff I will definitely be back. It's hard to find a great place with good soup and sandwiches these days and that's definitely hit the spot"}
{"text":"Are used to go to the potbelleez almost everyday but then he said we just got to be pretty bad they don't taste good at all I'd like to sell it so so it's a really good but I just don't care their soups either The super nasty soups milkshake is so good"}
{"text":"Strolling through Bloor St., I'm so grateful to have stumbled upon this gem of a cute and hip sandwich spot. First off, there was a live musician inside who created a warm and homey ambiance. When you walk down the stair, you are greeted with cups of ice and free tea samples! With a good first impression, I was excited to try out these rather high end sandwiches, kind of like a better version of Subway. 

The menu was pretty simple, with simple offerings of stacked meat and cheese that will for sure cater to the tastebuds of menu. Decided to order an off-menu special that was available for a limited time, the pulled-pork sandwich. The original sandwich was about $8, but to upgrade to the \"BIG\" size, which is about $3 more, it gives you 30% more sandwich. You can customize your sandwich with toppings but a lot of typical items costed extra, like cucumbers....

Honestly, the sandwich was just \"ok\". Pork was a bit on the drier side and the sauces given were too little. Not that many toppings were available for free, so overall I would still choose Subway as the cheaper option. But don't get me wrong, it's still worth trying once! Just not sure if I would pay Potbelly another visit..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised I have never been here before so I decided to try it based on the good reviews and I was very happy I did.  I ordered the meatball on white with everything on it -the bread was fresh and toasty!  You have a choice of what sides to put on.  I just had them put everything on it and I loved it.

I definitely will be back it tasted better than most.

The only negative that I had was I saw one of the sandwich makers scratch his head with his glove that he was supposed to be assembling sandwiches with so I would watch out for the employees and please change your gloves more often."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend, ordered Italian sub and meatball on flat bread. Tasty but not quiet filling."}
{"text":"If you feel like eating something like subway. Try this. It's waaaaay Better than subway for sure ! They actually got the concept of sandwich right. 
I love the house sauce !"}
{"text":"These guys are always on top if it. My kids love to eat here. We get it to go most of the time on school nights. Fairly inexpensive and fast. 
I like the protein salad."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmm so delicious, fresh, friendly service, and friendly prices.great highliter fuel."}
{"text":"Potbelly Sandwiches might be the best sandwich on/near campus, even though it's a chain. (Silver Mine comes a close second on my list)

The staff is always friendly and your orders are prepared in a speedy manner. They often speed up the process by having you pay while your sandwich is going through the oven. The extra speed is appreciated.

When it comes to soda their machine distributes both Pepsi and Coke, something I don't recall seeing in too many places.

Their chocolate chip cookies are too die for."}
{"text":"I really like this place for lunch, I order online and it's fast and easy and the sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"awesome toasted sandwiches and milkshakes. Had buffalo chicken sandwich. It wasn't too spicy but just enough to make you take a swig of homemade milkshake. They carry both pepsi and coke. Very busy area. Grab a seat at the window to people watch while you eat."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't bother reviewing a chain restaurant, but Potbelly's is actually one of the few chain restaurants where I really enjoy eating and keep going back. They serves mainly sandwiches, which are pretty similar to what you would at Quizno's, albeit quite tastier and also quite cheaper ($4 at this location for a sandwich). The sandwiches come on delicious bread and are toasted: just great! They also have salads and soups, and a good selection of fountain drinks... (IBC root beer, yay!). And to boot, the place itself is nice enough that I don't mind hanging out there for a while. Really too bad we don't have Potbelly's on the East coast."}
{"text":"Now why hasn't Potbelly made it to the East and West Coasts yet? That boggles the mind... I discovered it at this location in Madison, and I love it! The sandwiches are really tasty (I usually get the turkey breast), and are just about the right size. They're also much cheaper than at Subway for instance. I also really enjoy the large selection of soft drinks, and especially the IBC root beer and cream soda. The soups are also very good. On top of that, the store is cozy and pretty cool looking... it just not feel like your usual fast food place. Probably my favorite chain for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered the Farmhouse salad, the menu days it is made with spinach and romaine.  Mine was made with iceberg lettuce and unfortunately there is as a LOT of white, some yellow with brown edges and of the little bit of green half of it was wilty. I didn't eat most of the lettuce but of the little I ate  I got a bite that tasted bad. I was a bit worried about the quality of the salad but had no other food so no choice.  At 1:30am I woke up with a stabbing pain in my upper intestines. I was awake for a couple hours but with water and medicine went back to sleep. I am angry that I got so sick eating something that should have been a healthy choice! That and a few crackers is all I ate, so I know that is what caused my illness! Never again Potbelly!!! I would rather not eat than get sick on food that wasn't even the way it was promoted! ! Ick!"}
{"text":"Food is great especially the Chicken and Cheese Sandwhich and the shakes. I always like this place. There  is wifi and the inside is so nice with photographs and nice seating. One thing to add the employees are kind of weird. They almost are talking on a dialogue they say the same thing to every customer."}
{"text":"Still struggling a bit to find their footing. We've had soup and salads a few times here now. They have been okay. Portion was really small on the small soup, but the taste (Pot Pie) was fine. Chicken salads were good- on a Sunday right after opening (both times) the food was fresh. It's a tight fit in there if they get busy. It's a bit of disappointment that the \"live music\" that seems to be a feature of other PBs is not going to be featured here. OTOH, if you're looking for a grab-and-go fresh sandwich or salad, this is the place. Decor-wise it feels a bit like the Chili's chain with pics on the wall, wood facades, etc. Employees were friendly enough."}
{"text":"This is the last time we will stop by here. We've been here several times but, today was it. We had to wait a long time for our sandwiches and the employee forgot a smoothie. It's always annoying to have to remind an employee about an order especially when we were the only ones in the establishment.
We can get more value at Firehouse. At least their meals are less expensive than here. Bye Potbelly!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for lunch for something different.  The wait is long around lunch time but the staff is pretty efficient and very nice!  Prices were about what you would expect from a place that is higher quality than a Subway.  I had a turkey sandwich and a cup of soup.  Both were fresh and tasted good.  Would make this a regular stop for my lunch."}
{"text":"I generally only write a review if I feel it is a 5 star or to warn people to save their $$$. This is a mixed review. Lets start with the good. If you want a really great milk shake this is a 5 star. The shake was made with REAL fruit, not flavoring. I loved it. The staff, even though they seemed a tad disorganized was very friendly, and their Potbelly vinaigrette was very tasty. OK, that's it for the good...now to the bad. I didn't go there for a milkshake (that was just a very tasty plus). I went there for a meal. I got a roast beef sandwich and loaded baked potato soup. I can't explain what the soup tasted like, but it didn't taste like potato that's for sure.  The sandwich? It had a few thin slices of roast beef and a slice of cheese on my choice of white or wheat bun or flat bread. Ya they give you a large choice of topping to choose from, but like was once said \"where's the beef?\" If you want atmosphere go here. If you want a really tasty sub sandwich go to Penn Station...even Subway has them beat."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! It's confusing to order the food and the staff seemed just as confused. The food was good. I ordered soup and salad which was pretty good! The place is pretty clean and wasn't too busy. I just wish the system was better and the service was just a tad bit better."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered Bigs Italian. When it says \"30% more of what you love\" I was expecting something bigger. Bread was soft and perfectly toasted. Meat seemed fresh. But it seemed like an average sandwich. Smaller than what I would of gotten somewhere else. Overall decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"If you can find parking, check this place out. They have a good selection of sandwiches, salads, and desserts. There aren't too many vegetarian options but the Mediterranean sandwich is good. It has red pepper hummus and veggies on toasted bread. They don't have a good drink selection so I usually just bring my own water. 

The best part about Potbelly is the milkshakes and the homemade cookies. The chocolate milkshake is amazing and the fresh oatmeal chocolate chip cookies just melt in your mouth. Try them! But don't look at the calories... You'll regret it."}
{"text":"We ordered two Mediterranean sandwiches and they were delicious as always. The chocolate malts are sooo good but a ton of calories. I had the spicy southwest vegetable soup and it was very spicy... I got really sweaty and my mouth was on fire. That was uncomfortable..."}
{"text":"Tasty little tiny sandwiches.  25 bucks for 4 little tiny cute sandwiches.   AND charged us for cucumbers.  Not ever coming back."}
{"text":"Apparently, Potbelly is a thing in the Midwest/East Coast...that I did not know. Basically, Potbelly is high quality Quiznos...which, I never even go to to begin with because I'm common folk and I do Subway. 

I got the Italian, which was tasty but to be honest, I like Subway more (for the price, size, and customization - minus the bread smell) or fine, Jersey Mike's (for the quality of their cold cuts). Potbelly's portions are definitely on the smaller side. I feel like they should at least include a pickle then, no? 

Don't mind their free wifi though."}
{"text":"Yum! Went here on a whim when I was on jury duty downtown. So glad I did. Ordered the roast beef \"big\" toasted and put on my favorite toppings. This is the best lunch sandwich I have had in quite some time. Blows JJ's out of the water. Will be back when I'm hungry downtown in need of something quick. Don't forget to add the hot peppers!"}
{"text":"So one of my associates ordered a sandwich today and it was made incorrectly and she gave it to me... Big mistake now I'm sick I am probably going home for the day..."}
{"text":"Super good!  Great sandwiches, friendly and helpful staff, and fast service without skimping on quality.  Also, very reasonably priced.  I will be going back to this sandwich place."}
{"text":"Being from the US, I was excited when I heard Potbelly was coming. Back in the US a sub and chips was about $8 so pretty affordable lunch. Unfortunately it's more expensive here, but it's still a good spot for lunch. I always get the original Italian and it never disappoints. Sometimes the service is a little slow or off. Best to beat the crowd by going at 11:45am or 1:00pm."}
{"text":"This is a simple, get-a-meal-in-a-pinch, sandwich shop. The employees were efficient and the ingredients were fresh and of good quality. 

Be sure to use the Potbelly App to receive perks."}
{"text":"This Potbelly gets 5 stars because they did a great job with my lunch the other day.  I typically pack my lunch, but one day last week I decided to go out and this location was very close to where I work.  The staff were very friendly and the service was quick and easy.  The dining area was clean and the view was nice.  Prices were very good as well.  Check it out if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the live music- went for a professional lunch, as this place is in an area populated with those working 9-5 jobs, and it was awkward. Most of the people eating in opted for a seat at the very back of the restaurant, away from the music... Perhaps a sign? I also found the sandwich to be very bland. I got the Italian with a few toppings and it was nothing to write home about, especially considering a small sub is ~$9. I had the pulled pork one at the Bloor location, also quite bland. Based on the price and taste, would rather Subway or Mr. Sub. Must say that the staff at both locations were very friendly, however, and nice decor!!!"}
{"text":"The staff work exceptionally hard to get orders correct. Their app is great and is easy to work. Good is always ready when you arrive. 

It's easier to order on the app even if you are dining in. The lines get long after 11:45. 

Good food and good value for money."}
{"text":"These are pretty tasty sandwiches-they could be a bit more generous with the meat but extra meat is only .75 cents more.  The bread is excellent which makes these sandwiches much better than your average sandwich shop.  If you think Subway is better, you're nuts- go and stay there please."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast (Washington DC), and there is a potbelly on almost every corner downtown.

I was super excited to visit this location because Potbelly is just awesome. 

Everyone here was helpful and friendly, they move quickly and their food is delicious. I had the turkey and swiss with bacon and a little bit of everything (toppings)...it was amazing!!! They didn't over load my sandwich and everything was just right.

I also had the dream bar and a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie...amazing

I am deeply sadden that I cannot get Potbelly everyday (I live three hours away)...but this location does an amazing job!"}
{"text":"I moved from Chicago in 2006 to Phoenix and ever since the #1 thing I missed...POTBELLY!  I had one steps from my home in Lincoln Park and steps from my office downtown.  I found out a few months back they were coming to Phoenix and the elation I felt was like I won the lottery.  My only complaint now is this shop is not closer to my house...I'm quite certain when Phoenix realizes how delicious they are they will grow around the city.  I have been to the Camelback location since it opened many times.  It does not feel like my Potbelly in Lincoln Park in terms of environment, but the staff here is great as well.   I would give this 10 stars out of 5 if I could.  Even better is they have added a Mediterranean sandwich that they did not have when I lived in Chicago.  Let me tell ya that sandwich is absolutely delicious!  The wreck, the turkey, the chocolate chip cookies, a root beer...it is just a little slice of heaven and I couldn't be more thrilled that they finally expanded to Phoenix.  Not one day has passed since I left Chicago that I did not dream of a Potbelly turkey sandwich and chocolate chip cookie.  YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  

Get the peppers and seasoning...and drool away!"}
{"text":"MmmmmMMMmmMMmmm YUM!

My good pal and co president of Mu Chi Mu Charles took me here for the first time. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ON THE UNHEALTHY SIDE THIS IS A PRIME CHOICE

GET YO DAD BOD ON

My favorite is the wreck with hot peppers, if you don't like it then you probably have awful taste buds and should just move right along to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies!!!
I love the chicken and cheddar, but the wreck is good too!

It's my go to lunch spot when I want to eat out :)

Love when they have live music!

Get the banana milkshake- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I am biased.  I have been going to Potbelly's for over 20 years.  It started at the first Potbelly's in Chicago over 20 years ago.  I do make a point to get the roast beef, double meat, everything, no peppers, extra mayo and mustard.  Also having BBQ potato chips and a root beer helps with the experience.  No matter the location, Potbelly's never disappoints."}
{"text":"I am originally from Chicago and was in the Phoenix area last week.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Potbelly's had opened locations in the Phoenix area.  I had been visiting the original Potbelly's location on Lincoln Avenue for years.  Of course I ordered an extra beef with everything no hot peppers, barbecue potato chips and a oreo shake.  It did no disappoint.  It completely reminded me of home.  Well done."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, I have been going to the original location on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago since the early 90's.  I just ordered the roast beef, extra meat, with everything, no hot peppers and also extra mayo and mustard.  BBQ chips with a root beer.  It was made just how I remember it from years ago.  Just terrific!  Of course, I finished with an Oreo milk shake.  Great finish.  I cannot wait for Potbelly to open on the west side..."}
{"text":"I always get the same: the wreck. LOVE those spicy peppers. Recently I was sick and tried the tomato soup and it impressed me, too! The sugar cookies are the best I've ever had, but I won't tell you how many calories are in those puppies."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and design,  meh sandwiches.  I got a turkey sandwich and yes it was ok,  the bread was really good but the flavor was bland."}
{"text":"Although I Love Potbelly's food, I loathe this location. I typically order online and pickup, big mistake. I have ordered online over a half dozen times now and my order is always messed up. Like how does one forget chicken to be placed on a chicken salad sandwich? Or when I say no cheese and there's extra cheese or I say lots of pickles and get 1 pickle?  Seriously what's up with being so stingy on pickles? Basically pickle Nazis. 
I just want the sandwich I ordered! It shouldn't be that hard to make a sandwich."}
{"text":"Potbelly's is fine, I guess. It's never been terribly impressive for terribly good and this location is no exception. Possibly a step up from Subway, though I do not enjoy Subway at all."}
{"text":"Love peppers! Get the bread thin cut to ditch 1/3 of the bread aka carrier.
I had very LOW expectations because my Mom said she had it & didn't enjoy it. I'm happy to say this time Mom wasn't quite right. This place is yummy in the tummy, staff helpful & love that the calories are posted on the sammies. Keep up the good work Potbelly."}
{"text":"Sandwich was great and the staff was okay -- typical Potbelly overly casual approach -- I'm not a Potbelly regular and I feel like that annoys them in a way because I'm not on point when ordering. 

Place was dirty and not just from their dinner rush.  I'm surprised that Potbelly's doesn't have a better hold on the cleanliness honestly as the last Potbelly I was in (Bloomington, IL) had the same story -- good food, blah staff, dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"Waiting to see Billy Joel, but needed a quick snack.  Walked around and saw this place. Asked some of the people eating on the patio how their sandwich was.  Answer: Good! Sandwiches are listed and as you are on line a young lady comes by with a tablet asking you what type of sandwich you want and on what kind of bread.  I chose multi-grain. Technologically efficient and impressive.  As you walk along on the line you are faced with choices---the refrigerator beckons you to a drink,  a cookie jar flaunts itself and asks you to take one, and the display of all kinds of chips begs you to be bad for the day.  But I was good.  I ordered the \"italian\" which includes provolone cheese, pepperoni, cappicola, and I believe some ham... who remembers.... but it all sounded good.  When I arrived at the sandwich making station, all I had to do was tell them the add on's.  Mine were:  hot peppers, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles  oil and italian seasoning.  Once my sandwich was in the bag, I noted that the sandwich was warm.  I took it out to eat it on the patio and I said: Oh, no.  NOT a Heated, COLD CUTS sandwich!! and then....I took one bite.  What a delicious sandwich!!! and how crunchy it was with all those add on's.  Potbelly, I forgive you for heating up my sandwich. Won't you do it again, sometime?  
Did I tell you guys how lovely and friendly EVERYONE was at this place.  It was like dying and going to heaven---Food and otherwise."}
{"text":"What a waste of money for a over processed-salty sub.  I begged a differ from the last reviewer who said it was more upscale with more quality ingredients. Sadly, what you get here is probably subpar to subway or Quiznos.

For starters the bread is not baked fresh in store it comes from somewhere else in a plastic bag.  Second, the meat is weighed to the GRAM on a scale to ensure they don't give you anything extra. Third, they don't offer nearly as many toppings as you would find at subway or Quiznos nor are the toppings as fresh.  

They also don't let you see your sandwich being made. The counter is so high you can barely see over.  The large sub barely satisfies, the value is not here nor is flavor or quality.

Also it seems that there are a string of fake rave reviews about this place so buyer beware."}
{"text":"Better than subway but nothing special."}
{"text":"Open up a shop in the west valley, pronto!"}
{"text":"Came for an icecream sandwich and it's nothing like pictured! Literally barely any icecream (see photo). The cookie was warm and fresh though. For $5.65 after tax I am rather disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stopped by potbelly the other day on the way home from a costco run, the sandwiches were alright. We got a cheddar chicken, pizza sandwich and an Italian. While the meat was tasty and the seasoning was good, but honestly we all felt like it was overpriced for the amount of sandwich you get. For a name like potbelly I was personally expecting a stuffed sandwich, but there was only 1 layer of each meat with the Italian, meaning that it was pretty much just bread and toppings for like 6 bucks with a 6 inch sub. However my wife liked the pizza sandwich and felt it was worth the $6 price tag, so 3 stars for making the wife happy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of potbelly having eaten it for years in USA. 
They finally opened a few locations in Toronto recently. Was very excited to eat their cookies and smoothies.. yum..

Anyways this location is good, clean and spacious inside.. but there is limited parking options outside. It's a very busy intersection.

I ordered a sandwich, smoothie and a cookie. The cashier mistakenly charged me twice for the smoothie. I only realized when I got home. I will have to drop 1 star just for this mistake. Otherwise a lovely place."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my GSon we had a great time and he had the meatball sandwich and I had chicken salad sandwich they were both good store was very clean salads looked nice but mac salad I think came out of a tub was nothing to talk about but overall sandwiches were great for the price..."}
{"text":"Have given up on subway!!!! This place is incredible!!! Just love their sandwiches & soup. Next time I need to try the peppermint shake!!!!"}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant, gives a nice homely feel, warm brick and tile floors, with warm wooden booths, greet you. Sadly, a barrage of music like you're about to eat at a nightclub also greets you. 

There is plenty of seating, and I ended up eating after 3 pm, so the place was very empty. Lots of seating in the front, around the sandwich preparation area and behind it. 

The menu is limited. Sandwiches, soups, chili, milkshakes, cookies and chips. There is no combo option, it seems, so, you will be eating a la carte. Sandwiches are approximately $7 for what looked like a six inch sub, or maybe slightly bigger. Chili was $4 for the small, which is similar in size to Wendy's. Non-alcoholic drinks were from $2.50 to over $5.00.  Chips were about $1.50 for a small bag. Milkshakes started at $5. So, very quickly, your meal adds up, mine ended up being over $15, for 3 items, a sandwich, the chili and a bottle of pop. 

When you order on the far end of the counter, the first person triages your order, for instance, my chili needed to be prepared by the cashier, which was way down the line. He then proceeded to stuff the bread with meat and cheese. Then, he puts it on the conveyer to heat up the sandwich, and melt the cheese at the same time. 

It takes awhile for the sandwich to come out the other end, but a friendly person on the other end dresses your sandwich with veggies and dressing. She then wraps your sandwich, not once but twice, and then proceeds to shoot the sandwich down the line. 

Finally, you reach the cashier, but here is where the music becomes a hinderance, we couldn't hear each other. It was very difficult to hear her repeat my order, and she didn't hear me when I told her that the chili was mine. The counter was very cluttered and it was hard to see her or feel connected to her with some many obstacles in the way. The bill was higher than I would have wanted, my only hope was the food was phenomenal.

Sadly, this doesn't end your experience, she pointed around the corner, and I followed her finger to where I found out that I could have had a fountain drink, coffee or tea. This is also the area where you can get any utensils and napkins that you would need for your meal. 

Overall, if this restaurant was full, it would have been very difficult to get in and get out quickly. This is because the line loops back towards the entrance. In addition to this, because the conveyer is so slow, you will have a backlog at the person dressing your sandwich, as well as the area for drinks and utensils. 

I sat down to eat my sandwich and noted that everyone seemed to come back and forth from me to do various tasks, so, depite the music, it was hard to eat in peace. Kind of like eating at a busy McDonald's even though this restaurant was mostly empty. 

Bathroom is mostly clean, they have restrooms near the front but they look like you need to go down some stairs. In the back, there is a unisex washroom.

Service is good. Food is okay. Prices are high."}
{"text":"After I tried Potbelly for the first time in Chicago, I just fall in love with it! This place has the most delicious sandwich and shake I've ever all my life! You can imagine how happy I am when I learned that we have Potbelly in Phoenix! (I thought there is no Potbelly in AZ) I kept telling my friend how good it is and finally we group of 15 people went there last week. Not surprisingly, all of them love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious and surprisingly vegetarian friendly! Super fast and not too expensive at all! Definitely going to go again and again, love it!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 5   rating but it's just another sandwich joint. Same service,  same sandwiches... Nothing special. If you are hungry and are looking for a quick bite this place is OK. However,  next door competition is waiting."}
{"text":"As someone who had lived in Chicago for a while, when I saw Potbelly's I had to stop. the location in gilbert was clean and the service was excellent. I was surprised when I got home how little meat was in the sandwich. I did see an option for extra meat but didn't think to add based on the original price. Maybe I should have. The fond memories I have of Potbelly's in Chicago are just a Thomas Wolfe saying...You can never go home again. There are more places to buy subs in Gilbert so in the future...I will"}
{"text":"Overall, a pretty good place. A bit confusing when you are rushed through during their rush hour. I can say this though, I would have no problem going back to pick up another sandwich."}
{"text":"I got the new \"Clubby\" sandwich today. Turkey, ham and bacon with ranch dressing....SO GOOD!  Their bread is out of this world great and unlike any other sandwich place, which I think sets it apart from all others. It is flaky and crispy and totally delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I have to leave a review as The negatives here are certainly not warranted. Expensive? Under $5.00 for a great sandwich is cheap in my books. If you are used to the cheapest quality mass produced $5.00 foot long you know where to go, please don't compare that to this. Please don't listen to anyone saying subway is better. This is massively superior in every way. This place has a great funky vibe, excellent staff (when I was there), and something I really like... Both Coke and Pepsi fountain pop. It was very clean, had plenty of parking (maybe not so during lunch?) 
Is this the best I've ever had? No but it's certainly in the top 10, and probably second best from a chain. Best would be earl of sandwich but there aren't many around here. Check this place out. Just remember you are eating a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great salad and fun band that kept the kids entertained."}
{"text":"So I started with Subway. Moved my way to Jersey Mike. Then came Potbelly sandwiches. I know you may think my sandwhich history seems sad, but this place not only made me excited about the neatly wrapped sandwhich, but the variety of foods, and decor and ambience of this place.

First, a shout out to Chris for his amazing service, recommendations, and selling me and the wifey on an ice cream sandwhich. I got the Wreck and the wifey got the Italian. Dude bro, this Southern Cali boy is digging these Chicago style tastes. With the clean look, hot peppers that compliment in a tangy way, and flavor from being baked meshed all these ingredients perfectly. My wife says I get super excited about little things. Well the little things of great service, decor of character and history, the choice of a milkshake or smoothie, gets this guy excited!

We used the oatmeal chocolate cookie and chocolate brownie cookie as buns to the creamy vanilla ice cream. What? You used 2 different cookies as buns? Oh, you bet your bottom dolla! Oatmeal was spot on, while the brownie was rich and sweet. The wifey loved it, but it was def a little too sweet for me. Great dessert though.

I will definitely be back to try other sandwiches, say what's up to Chris, and enjoy a lovely time with my beautiful wife. Way to go Potbelly! Let's just hope this belly stays trim. Good price, calories are visible, therefore, I shall see you again!"}
{"text":"The Tuna Salad on wheat was okay. Too bad the staff are way more into talking to  each other than being friendly with customers."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! I had the Italian with hot peppers and my son had the Wreck. Staff was very pleasant (wish I remembered the girls name who helped us, she helped make it a great experience) and the place was clean. Can't wait for one in California!"}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean sandwich and added chicken to it on Multigrain bread. It was so tasty. I love how soft the bread is and that they toast it. Staff were friendly, but a bit slow in making the sandwich...so that's why I gave this review 4 stars. Women's bathroom was tidy and clean. All the tables were clean. Cheesy broccoli soup was just okay..kind of bland. Other than that, a nice healthier option for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious toasted subs, friendly employees, clean establishment. What Subway wishes it could be."}
{"text":"I went to this place one.  The sandwich was O.K. but rather small for the price. I guess if you want a large one you just have to order several small ones.  

With lots of other great sandwich places, I rate this one near the bottom. If nothing else, with the others you feel like you are getting your money's worth. Which Wich, Jimmy Johns, and definitely Capriotti's are all much better and better deals.  Subway, we'll we won't go there but to their credit the sub will be bigger than here and half the price."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to this sandwich shop. They have awesome food. Great vegetarian options. The staff here is super nice and they are open until 9 or 10. I just wish there was one close to my work. I would eat there every day,  no joke. I always get their big pickles, they are so tasty! Looking forward to eating here again very soon."}
{"text":"Potbelly, you are so welcome in Toronto! 

I moved here from Chicago, where it originated from and simply missed their sandwich. My go to is the wreck, with hot peppers(giardiniera). You need to have them on your sandwich, it really completes it and gives that Chicago taste. 

Rock on potbelly, I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"I was SO happy to see this place come to Phoenix.. my memories of lunch at Potbelly's in Dearborn, MI were re-lived with the delicious and unmistakably fantastic sandwich that is the Italian... had one last night and they did not disappoint.

This place is going to get visited by people that have, at one point in their life, experienced a wonderful, warm, toasted, slightly dripping with mayo sandwich that is a Potbelly's and so those that are used to eating crap like Subway are not going to \"get it\"...  in the case that you do appreciate the craft and combinations of flavors, try the Italian - the blend of meats and the combination of toppings (get them all) make for a flavor explosion in your mouth.  I can only eat half a sandwich, it's that filling.  I have the other half in the fridge right now that I will re-toast in the toaster oven so I can enjoy it allll over again. Eat that, Subway.

PS: The staff was very nice, as always, and friendly and talkative and the place inside is decorated with such care and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Potbelly Sandwich Shop for lunch while in downtown Charlotte. Primarily came here based on Yelp ratings, and those Yelp ratings did not lie. This place was great, there are lots of sandwich options and each sandwich is customizable to your taste. 

I got the Mediterranean sandwich with chicken. It was very good. I added a few things to my sandwich, including the Potbelly hot peppers. I would recommend these to anyone that loves a kick in their sandwich. I also got the mac and cheese side, which was good. 

Great sandwich spot in the heart of downtown Charlotte, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This new Chicago chain sandwich shop just opened up recently.  I'm giving this place 3.5 stars, but am rounding up due to some of the overly harsh reviews it has gotten.  

As you walk in you notice the surprisingly  massiveness of the place that one would not imagine from the outside.  I like the decor, it's a mixture of old Italian and Boston pizza look.  I ordered the big pizza sandwich.  The big is 9 inches while the regular is only about 6 inches.  The sandwich was pretty good, tasty and full of flavor. 

Overall I was impressed.  As someone who buys lunch every single day, the price point is comparable to other sandwich shops and fast food places.   I will have to be back to try the other ones soon."}
{"text":"So yummy! 

I'd had Potbelly's sandwiches before when visiting the midwest, so I was thrilled that they were opening an outpost here in the Valley :) 

We finally had a chance to check it out just after Thanksgiving and it was terrific. I love a good toasted sub sandwich and that is just what these are: delicious and toasty. 

They have some pretty standard offerings for the actual sandwiches (I've tried the Italian, the Roast Beef, the Chicken and Cheddar, all of which are super), but I like the option of a few extras that you can upgrade to for an additional cost (bacon, for example - who doesn't love some bacon added to, well, anything?) 

The toasting process really locks in the goodness, warming up the meat, making the bread a little crunchy at the edges (but still soft and chewy inside), and goo-ifying the cheese which allows it to meld with the meat and bread into one perfectly tasty unit. 

Once the toasting is complete, you can add your toppings. One option is their own hot peppers. These hot peppers totally sealed the deal for me. I've had their sandwiches without them and they're good, but the flavor that these peppers added were definitely an upgrade, and the thing that'll keep me coming back. 

In addition to the sandwiches, they have bags of chips, fountain sodas, a cooler full of specialty sodas, juices, and drinks, along with amazing-sounding shakes (which I haven't tried) and signature cookies.

We did not order any cookies, but the guy who helped us popped over to the table after we sat down to ask if he could give our son some mini oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Props to him both for the thought and for asking first (we of course said yes - you don't pass up free cookies!) 

The staff was very nice and friendly, although their loudly tie-dyed shirts were a bit much. There was a brief serenade from one of the guys while we were dining (I believe the song was Applause by Lady Gaga) but I believe this was because it had to do with their conversation with some of the other guests, so we didn't mind too much.

The decor in the restaurant is nice; the layout is similar to many quick sandwich shops (counter, register, and soda along one wall with tables along the other), however the furnishings are nicer than the norm, the lighting is warm instead of over bright fluorescent lights, and the decorations are comfortable and unique. 

Pricing is pretty typical of this sort of shop, and the fact that the sandwiches are as good as they are means that this is a good value. 

I absolutely recommend checking this place out! Hopefully they'll expand into the East Valley soon so that we can stop in more often :)"}
{"text":"First time checking out this place and would give it 4/5 stars.  It was packed with the lunch crowd but line moved quickly.  Ordered the wreck and it was solid, much better than Quiznos but same style.  $5.25 or so for a regular sandwich so you won't break your bank."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Italian sub sandwich I've ever had in my life. Although it could've been because I was really, really hungry. Please franchise out to Southern California. Outstanding hot pepper mix too. Bravo."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich. Reminds me a bit of JJ's but not as fast.
We walked over one night since we stayed at the hotel next door. It was so convenient."}
{"text":"Terrible service. One time I came in and somehow they messed the order on a simple turkey sub and today there were literally no other patrons and nobody came to take my order - a waited for 5 minutes. Done with this location."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service with a smile. Chicken noodle soup was very good, not just broth very hearty. Service was quick, friendly and food was fresh. I got the wreck reg which was plenty and tasted good."}
{"text":"What can I say I love Potbelly a lot.  I met my sister her for lunch to catch up.  We both had the ham and swiss sandwich.  They were both good.  The only thing I did not like was the chips.  I got the bag of regular.  The chips appeared to be greasy in the bag like they were cooked in oil that was not hot enough.  No big deal though.  I tried the voodoo heat chips my sister had and thought they were good.  My sister did get a pickle too.  I also got a oatmeal chocolate chip cookie too.  It was great.  Like this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good as always had the same sandwich. Next time I am trying the Pizza sub."}
{"text":"Shakes are sometimes made with the improper amount of milk, management is not very personable and in fact are often rude. You feel more like an intruder than a customer, let alone family. The team members are very friendly and remember you and make meaningful conversation.

When placing orders online, if I leave allergen specific requests (such as no mushroom, no tomato) in the additional details section, food is still improperly prepared. This has happened on 3 separate visits. Additionally I was assured I would be refunded for a food item I paid for that was not included in my order, and it has been a month with no results. This store has so much potential and unless there is a change in management they will not get the positive feedback that I know they are capable of earning. 
____________________
On my 11/24/16 visit associate Taylor prepared my order superbly. She followed the instructions in my additional details and prepared my order neatly. My shake was deliciously thick! My original pick up time was 12:15, but Taylor had it ready when I arrived 10 minutes early -- she even put napkins in my bag!"}
{"text":"When you order from a restaurant toy should feel wanted or welcome as a customer... Not treated poorly and rushed.. Each of the 3 occasions I went to Potbelly the girls taking my order were rude and obnoxious. If I could give it a zero I would."}
{"text":"First timer; I had a Wreck sandwich with mushrooms.. GRAAT HOT SAM, with great bread!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite new places. I have seen them around town but had not tried it until they opened near my house. Staff working the night of Feb 3rd was incredible, informative and they highly recommended that we sample their chicken pot pie soup. Glad they did, we ended up ordering the soup with our sandwhich. Everything was very good, we ordered the chicken and cheddar, with bacon and avocado, as well as the chicken salad. Definitely Good Vibes and Great Sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I don,t know about this place.  

Last time we had sanitation issues where the person building sandwiches iched his face and continued to make sandwiches.  This time, we ordered and got to the registers and all the trays were wet and the top one was oily and dirty.  The cashier said that they probably brought them out that way...??  really, I guess so.

We got our food and they put jalapenos on Johns sandwich.  He took it up and the girl told him that he ordered it that way.  She told him never mind she would make another one.  

Tables dirty floor dirty.  Im thinkin I will try Jersey Mikes next time."}
{"text":"Mad love for their chicken pot pie soup, Turkey sandwiches, Ham & Tomato Melt, bag of mini cookies, ice cream sandwich and malts! This is comfort food as it was intended."}
{"text":"Better than subway but that is about it in terms of the sandwiches, just ok. The saving grace is the milkshake, which is made with real fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I live right down the street and often order online and pick up to avoid the crowds that Starbucks brings. Once I had to wait like 30 seconds for my unready sandwiches and they set me up with a free drink to compromise. I wasn't even done filling up my cup before they had the food ready. 

Not my favorite sub place, but I will keep going back for the convenience and the nice service. Multigrain bread isn't great, and the Italian meats are so sad. When I hear the words \"capicola\" and \"mortadella\" my heartrate increases a bit as I anticipate some authentic flavor. Unfortunately they don't pack much of a punch. The Pizza sandwich (Italian + meatballs) sounded so delicious when I was starving, but I was sad about the meatballs and general lack of flavor. I am interested in trying their other regular turkey sandwiches and whatnot too. 

Banana milkshake is pretty stinkin' amazing. I've also had their frozen strawberry lemonade (which I think is just a summer promotion) and really enjoyed it! Perfect amount of sour and sweet. Grab a Dream Bar if you have a sweet tooth :)"}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean with Chicken Sandwich.  The sandwich was very tasty.  I like that their sandwiches are warm/toasted.  The restaurant seemed clean and the employees were nice."}
{"text":"First trip here food was very bland and the overall conditions were horrible. Tables were nasty fountain drink machine had not been cleaned in what looked like forever 1/2 or the drinks were empty. It would be a good place for a sandwich shop for sure is only positive thing I can truly say"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Tonight was my first time trying it out! Everyone inside was super nice and patient with me as i had no idea was to get. The guys there, even gave me some ideas as to what i should try! I ended up getting the Italian sandwich, and it was so yummy! i will be coming back to try their soups and smoothies! Thank you for a new sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Made to order sandwiches and salads. You pick what you want and they can omit items if you want. I had the \"wreck salad\" and the \"Mediterranean salad\" and I loved them both. My niece had the meatball sub and she said it was really good. You can dine in or you can take out. You order at the counter then take to your table. They also have a few sweets to choose from as well. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich place! Worth the wait if there is one!"}
{"text":"After years away from Chicago living in Atlanta I can't tell you how happy I am to see Potbelly's popping up all over the valley. There is a reason why their corporate keeps adding locations (no franchisees anymore)...their food is amazing!

Before we get to the amazing food, a few items of note. They have sandwiches, soups, salads and breakfast...did I mention they have shakes, malts and smoothies? From heaven!  It's not called Potbelly's for nothing. So don't think you are eating that healthy....oh wait, yes you can if you want. They offer their sandwiches \"skinny\" which is less meat and thin cut (1/3 bread)  

1)Service-I've never had a bad experience in all my years and in all the various locations I've been to...and I've been to a lot of Potbelly's I tell ya.  The staff, even when slammed are usually outgoing and make conversation and whatnot as they prepare your sandwich.  And they do get slammed but they all take it in stride.  Kudos to their management for hiring smiling and outgoing/upbeat people.  

2)Decor/Ambiance-This isn't bland Subways...each location is setup kinda the same but definitely has personality.  Like their sandwiches.  A little bit of flair.  

3) Food-8 types of soups, 5 types of salads, 11 types of sandwiches.  Ok so the food options, if you like chicken salad sandwiches, you should love this place.  Chicken salad on multigrain wheat with peppers I could literally eat for lunch everyday..it never gets old.  

Dessert-Shakes and malts are awesome too..I try to restrain myself..usually fire one up 1 out of 4 visits.   Did I mention they fresh bake their own cookies daily?"}
{"text":"They have really good breads. The filling was a little bit on the short side but they still had a decent amount. Definitely better than your monopolize sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The prices are high for the tiny portions that are provided. I'd understand if the sandwiches were good.... But we have yet to try one we like. The first time we stopped in, the girls that helped us were very rude. This last time, the guy and gal that helped us were actually very friendly, but still the sandwich was nothing to write home about (and was toasted to much the bread hurt the roof of your mouth)."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches but extremely poor attitudes among high school aged children employees. I have been to this location 4-5 times and had to return twice due to missing items.

Recently asked to speak with manager and the young lady with gum hanging out of her mouth identified herself as the manager. At that point I realized my complaint was of no use!

I would truly give the sandwiches ***** but after giving the staff -3 stars it's only fair to give them at least two stars.

Hate to give up on the sandwiches so I will just go to another location.

Word to the kid manager, work on your attitude and lead by example. Complaining about customers to your subordinate high school peers makes for a poor leadership. Heck, at least wait until paying customers leave the store num num!!!!"}
{"text":"They say they do delivery. But they do not do delivery on the weekends. Then why advertise it? It's like saying free beer! Only on Sunday between 7-8 am. I'm sure there are takers , but you're in the vast minority . 

You have failed me today , Potbelly, failed me. Truthfully, I may never patronize your establishment again."}
{"text":"I order Potbelly almost once a week for  lunch meetings and for guests/VIP's we have come into our office.  The food is always fantastic, service is always very friendly, and the online ordering makes everything a breeze!  Not to mention the prices are extremely reasonable!!  Everyone should do themselves a favor and check Potbelly out...I can guarantee you'll be back!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with potbellys! This is a Great location right near ASU! Good selection of sandwiches- my favorite is the turkey with Swiss! Love the soups(broccoli and cheddar)  and their brand chips are flavorful! They have the same concept as Quiznos but I prefer this over Quiznos, fresher maybe?? The shakes are good too! My boyfriend loves the clubby- turkey Swiss and bacon with ranch, no longer on the menu but they'll make it for you!"}
{"text":"Every time I go there I am sorry I did. Food is good. Service is pretty awful. Moody teenagers who act like you are bothering them. Today's service was the best. A young girl with giant Gage's in her ears says \" what are you having\" basically rolling her eyes and rushing me through with a dirty look on her face. Basically you get an overpriced sandwich and an attitude. I tried calling ahead a couple of times but that seems to make it worse. Then you get to call ahead and still wait when you get there. My family will stick with panera next time. At least they are nice to you."}
{"text":"A big thank you to the crew that worked today. Our soccer team went here for lunch after a game....40 people walking in the middle of lunch hour is no easy feat and you guys handled it like pros!  The food was great and service fantastic.....thank you!"}
{"text":"I had tuna on a flat bread and it was really good. The line was a bit ridiculous during lunch hours but it was definitely worth it. Their mixed berry smoothie too is out of this world. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's great that Potbelly's is starting to pop up around the valley.  I was a big fan of them before moving here from the Midwest.

Since they're a national chain, the food is (probably) consistent wherever you go, but my favorites on their menu are the turkey & swiss sandwich (with lettuce, tomato, and italian seasoning) and their milkshakes, which come with tiny cookies on top--the oreo shake even comes with tiny oreos (!) on the lid.

The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was clean.  I'm not usually downtown--we were just grabbing a quick bite to eat before a concert at Symphony Hall nearby--but I'd hit up this Potbelly's again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, amazing fresh cookies, and friendly staff in a fun '70s rec room atmosphere. Would eat again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a nice lunch sandwich here today. Some of the reviews indicated the sandwiches are too small and not good value. In my opinion the are the perfect size and the price quite reasonable. Our supersize world seems to demand twice as much as we need during a meal. 

They are still pretty new so their staff is coming up to speed. Everyone was very friendly and our orders were prepared in a timely manner. They could really use better design of the space inside to create more seating and give the atmosphere a better vibe. 

I am sure to be back and look forward to rewarding that 5th star as they iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here, my 2nd time easting here. Let me just say this place would have received 4 stars if the menu was a bit more espansive. Right now it's just too limited. 

The food on the other hand is really good. I got the pizza sandwich on multigrain bread. 
This particular location get's very busy around noon so understand that. 

Like I siad there isn't much on the menu to choose from, It they added a few more option I would bump them up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was really upset about a previous experience and lack of delivery. Every time I got the office to order with me and collected money, I'd place the order then be told there were no drivers. Out of frustration and pregnancy hormones, I sent a not so nice email in the heat of the moment, never expecting to receive a response. I got a response right away. We did get our order the next week, we were promised our future delivery requests would never have any issues. This makes me so happy because we have so few delivery options and this is by far our favorite. Thank you for making sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I heard the lady in front of me order a cold sandwich and the counter girl who was very friendly suggested that the sandwiches are much better toasted.  Luckily, I love toasted sandwiches.

The entire staff was extremely friendly and I noticed that they were training at least 2 new hires.  This did not hamper service at all.

I ordered the the sandwich called \"A Wreck\" which was salami, roast beef, ham and turkey with swiss cheese and your choice of toppings.  I ordered mine an a wheat roll.  I appreciated that the roll was not huge and neither were the meat portions.  They made my sandwich to perfection and I am picky about how much dressing I order (I expect it to be a light layer when I ask it to be that way).  You receive your sandwich in a brown paper bag wrapped in white paper and cut in half.

My only small complaint was that they were making a \"to go\" or a large order for pickup, so the sandwich assembly person had to ask me what sandwich I had ordered so he could watch it to come out of the toaster over.  Not that big of a deal.

The place was very clean. There was also a local guitar player there for lunch and he was not too loud and was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love potbelly?! The sandwiches are So. Fricken. Good. I always get the chicken and cheddar 6in.  sandwich with all the toppings on top. Put it on some regular bread and whoa, it's delish. 

Service was great. Tables were a little dirty, and no, the place wasn't busy when we arrived. There is ample seating inside and a couple of tables outside. 

The drive thru is a huge plus. Will be back for some moreeee."}
{"text":"Ugh so yummy! I love this sandwich place! I'm always craving it! I had the turkey breast sandwich with mushrooms and everything on it. (Hot peppers on the side)    The sandwich was bomb.com! The shakes are also to die for! They are rich and creamy and flavorful!"}
{"text":"The menu said the chicken and cheddar sandwich was new, but I thought I had a similiar version at a different location. This version did not have the orange glaze sauce rather just cheddar and sliced chicken breast. I added the bacon for $1.25 (the kid was a good salesman) and that elevated this sandwich to a higher level. It really tasted good and a small is only $5.50 and should fill most folks up if you add a bag a of chips. Simple sandwich, but big taste."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever at Portbelly and boy was I a happy customer. 

The employees were super friendly and welcoming. Especially, lady that made our food, she was exceptional. Mind that this is kind of like fast food joint, the customer servise she gave was 5 stars. She should show some local restorants servers how its done...Can't remember her name :-(  

She made sure to welcome us with the kindest greetings. Explained menu to us in and out. Gave us samples to try...Amazing employee....Recommended few items on the menu while giving us a background/history of the Portbelly. 

Food was amazing! I had a Mediterranean sandwich and my boyfriend had a phlly sandwich. We were both happy with how they turned out to be. She also gave us a cookie on the house as first timers...

For sure recommending this place and we are definitely going back when in need of a fast and yummy sandwich fix."}
{"text":"Good sandwich. Not great, but good. The meat was a little cold in the middle, which I hate if you are going to toast my sandwich. 

Service was great. Super friendly staff, very courteous, and very upbeat and positive. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Italian sandwich, made to order! The milkshakes are fantastic as well! Excellent lunch and solid customer service. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Fresh food. A new guy was working so it took a little longer than it had before but that's no biggie. The sandwiches are tasty and my salad was perfect!"}
{"text":"Wow. The first time I walked in here I could not believe how amazing the smell was. 
I ordered the Italian with the works on the Multigrain roll.  I need to order this bread in bulk to take home.  
Yummy I am going back for more!"}
{"text":"First let me say I love Potbellys and will continue too.  I just hope they raise the level of service, I understand it's hard to find good help, but try a little harder.  Came today in for a breakfast sandwich and some coffee.  The girl working the register did not pay any attention too me and was talking about wildey inappropriate stuff with the rest of the staff, even to go as far as show the dance moves she hit last night.  The she finally rolls over with a \"Hey Babydoll, what did you have\", very nice.  I order a coffee and she hands me a cup, but surprise there is no coffee made.  At this point I just left the cup and walked out.  I will be back because I love the subs, but if that crew is working again i'll just pass for another day."}
{"text":"So far i'm a fan of this new sandwich/salad food court vendor in the Yonge & Sheppard centre. Had the egg & cheese breakfast sandwich & tuna salad thus far. Ingredients are fresh and high quality -- actually taste like home-made, real food, which is not easy to find at restaurants, especially quick-service ones! 

Also love that they serve Balzac's coffee -- some of the best coffee in Toronto, IMHO."}
{"text":"Great sandwich but a bit slim. The meat and toppings should almost be doubled but this was my first time so other sandwiches may be more filling. With that said, it was extremely flavorful! I will definitely return. I had the pizza sandwich I think it was. Really pleased that I added a pickle to the order, it was great."}
{"text":"We go here every time we flew into Midway. Now it's right up the street.  There food is great and the staff was very outgoing and friendly."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The wreck salad is a prepackaged salad totally below average. My friend got the wreck sandwich whick was ok. Go to the duck instead.\""}
{"text":"They open at 11 but people were inside by 10:50. I went cheap and only got a meatball sandwich. The total price was $5.25 including tax. Not bad. The sandwich was pretty good but not awesome. A decent sandwich for the money. I would recommend it and I will be going back. I'm gonna try the turkey or chicken sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and good prices. Get the larger sandwich for a buck more. Really like the multi grain bread and the fact that it was toasted perfectly."}
{"text":"Most of the sandwiches I've had are decent enough but tonight I got the tuna salad and it was the worst tuna I've ever had from a restaurant. Don't get it."}
{"text":"Omg I love love love this place! Are used to go to potbellies when I lived in Madison and I was ecstatic when I finally brought it to Phoenix. I always get a Wreck sandwich with everything on it including the hot pickles. It is amazing! It's basically a hot toasted sub sandwich which includes salami, oven roasted turkey breast, hickory smoked ham, melted cheese ( I get all 3 kinds), mayo, mustard, hot pickle, lettuce, onion, oil, Italian seasoning on whatever bread you choose- I get white. There is also a \"skinny\" option which is slightly less bread.  The sandwich is huge and can be easily divided to eat for latter. The cookies are also very very delicious."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for lunch.  Affordable, fresh, and friendly service.  Definitely will be coming here regularly!"}
{"text":"My friend Candace is always telling me how good is place is so we went here for lunch today. There was a lot of variety and for me that's a big deal. I got a grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich with bacon on white bread. It was good but I didn't think it was spectacular. If I would recommend this place over a Jimmy John's but I don think its on the level of Cheba Hut as far as toasted subs go. All in all it was good I would go again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, I let them pick my sandwich and it was as expected!! (A-Wreck) those hot peppers are amazing, would recommend them if you like a bit of heat!! We met the owner and he was very personable!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Worst \"customer service \" from the manager on Friday. Ordered 4 sandwiches only one correct and was basically told tough if it's not right not our problem. Expensive lesson"}
{"text":"Another chain sandwich shop with the usual bland sandwich. This chain seems prettier on the inside, but my chicken and cheddar sandwich was rather uninteresting and mundane. The prices are pretty good as this small went for $5.85. Just some pre packaged chicken pieces and cheese toasted. Everything else is extra like bacon and avocado. Wasn't in the upcharge mode.  Chain, chain go away."}
{"text":"Potbelly from these sandwiches?  Yeah right.  Not unless you order 20.  These things are midget sized.  Don't get me wrong, they are excellent tasting and the workers provide pretty good customer service but there isn't much value in these 5 dollar mini subs.

I ordered an Italian with the works on wheat bread.  The bread was toasted along with the meat.  The toppings were tasty, especially the hot peppers.  It was literally dripping on my napkins.  Savory, tasty, fresh, and then in a few bites GONE.  I should have ordered two.  My lunch mate's exact phrase when he looked at the sandwich was \"Wheres the other half?\"

The inside is very small and finding a parking is near impossible at lunch time.  I don't think I would come back again unless I wasn't hungry.  Then I probably wouldn't stop to eat in the first place if I wasn't hungry.  

Seriously, if you have a small hand complex come to Potbelly and hold one of these teeny tiny things and you will feel like Sasquatch."}
{"text":"They have the best sandwiches and hot peppers! Seriously, there hot peppers are to die for! They even have them packaged in a glass bottle for customers to pickle. I normally get take out a lot for lunch. They are always fast and efficient. In addition to friendly service. So many options as well! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So much space to sit, very friendly and helpful staff. A really yummy sandwich and lots of options. I enjoyed relaxing at a table and eating a flavourful and filling sub."}
{"text":"A new sandwich place on Bloor. Large sandwiches and salads in a more upscale spot than Subways. 

I was starving this afternoon so I opted for a Pizza Sandwich complete with meatballs, melted cheese and home made hot peppers. They were very nice and gave me pickes on the side. 

Overall it was a good sandwich , with lots of marinara sauce and a good bite from the hot peppers. Service was very quick and quite friendly. 

It was $10 with tax for the large sub. 

I'd like to come back and try a shake!"}
{"text":"I went to Potbelly's today with a friend of mine for the first time.

It's a cute little place in the Nordstrom Rack shopping center.    The shop was really cute and very clean.  You order at the counter and file your way down the row to pay and carry your order to the table on a tray.  (I don't know why, but I hate carrying food on a tray.)

There isn't an enormous amount of seating, but there seemed to be ample seating for the customers there.  There is also seating outside. 

I had the Uptown Salad with chicken.  It had apples, walnuts, bleu cheese, and lettuce.  It came with a small side of dressing.   It was very good... not the best salad ever, but it was good.

My friend had an Italian sub that looked to die for!   I would have begged for a bite if it didn't have tomatoes on it- since tomatoes are deadly to me.   He also had a side of broccoli cheddar soup, which smelled amazing.  He loved both! 

Next time I go, I'm having an Italian sub... it looked a lot better than my salad, so I'm going to try it.  

I liked Potbelly's enough to go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Potbelly's looking for something less greasy in the mall. Even though they've plopped themselves in the 'more real restaurant' corner space of the food court, don't be fooled. It's mall food. 
Their menu layout is confusing and crowded, making it hard to know what I can order let alone their methods.
I ordered a 'original' size sandwhich, their regular/medium, roast beef. I wanted the cheese, whatever came on it, and some avacado. The person at the front of the service line asked what we wanted, then immediately got distracted and started talking to another employee. It was loud and continually confusing. He asked if I wanted what came with it and I said yes. Turns out that just landed me paying extra for mushrooms, which make me sick, and greasy bacon. The next person was confused as to what I got, despite only being a foot from the first person. I then realized this was just a more confusing subway and this was the toppings guy. I repeated myself, confused what he wanted till I realized this, then was pretty done. 
After that we got to a third person where we had to repeat our order another time, find out we were paying extra for every topping, and $20 later (for two sandwiches and two drinks) we left. Frustrating. Never doing that again.

As for flavor my roast beef was fatty greasy and pretty gross. The chicken was good. I'm sure someone would like the flavor, everything else was just so infuriating I never want to go back."}
{"text":"As they promised it was less than 8 minutes through the line and believe me I was timing it from the start. I mean it is the first thing you see as you walk in to the store. Great location and they do deliver from 11am to 2pm which will now be well utilized going forward. The store however is very clean and warmly decorated, and it pulls me to come back again. I had the Italian which is one of their signatures and for good reason. I am a man of simple taste but a strict eye for detail. The sandwich was amazing to say the least. The help was knowledgable and very friendly. I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try for yourself! Who knows you might even run into me if you do!"}
{"text":"Who copied who? Did Quizno come before Potbelly - these two chains are exactly the same, lousy. Potbelly says they slice their sandwiches fresh, but the dude (who annoyingly called me and every other guy \"Boss') did not slice anything. He might have sliced it a week ago and then he just grabbed it and put in my sandwich. To top it off, the turkey is another low quality variety that is suitable for cow feed. Yeah, that's why the prices are so cheap - it was five bucks for the food and the turkey quality was masked because it looks like a wrap with alot of bread and toppings jammed inside. This is one time I was glad there wasn't alot of meat in my sandwich. College kids and construction workers will like this crap, but you ain't fooling the rest of the smart eaters in America, well maybe you are because of your snappy name and grand openings that require a PR agent, but never again for this guy. You also charge $3.50 for a tiny cup of soup. Bah Humbug."}
{"text":"Add avocado to the hand cut chicken and cheddar sandwich and for 7 bucks, you will have a tasty lunch. Only issue is the confusing  order system and signage. You don't order at register closest to entrance. Put some arrows on the floor. Friendly manager at this location."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in the area!  The \"Wreck\" is soooo good.  Great price for how much food you get.  I'm a fan of the soups and of the chili as well, not to mention the employees are always friendly and patient no matter how busy they are.  I really do enjoy dining in, taking out, or having delivery from Potbelly."}
{"text":"Charlotte Agenda raved about this place so of course we had to try it. Definitely Overrated. No different than which wich. Nothing to be impressed with at all."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are excellent. I'm a big fan of the chicken and cheddar, and their hot peppers are very tasty (they are quite hot).

What really sets Potbelly's apart for me, though, is the service. None of the other restaurants near by in the same market can compare."}
{"text":"This is a great place!! I'm a big eating caveman, so I got two sandwiches. I ordered the pizza and the turkey with bacon. The pizza had a fantastic flavor. The turkey is exactly what you would expect. The bacon made the sandwich pop though. Very fast service. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love Potbelly!  I stopped at this location for a Wreck salad.  They completed it promptly, perfectly and deliciously.  

Can't complain."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the bad review.  We have been here several times and it is a great step up from the big chain sub shops.  Their sandwiches are delicious and the service is friendly. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Mediterranean sandwich is a great vegetarian sandwich option. Plus the strawberry shake is pretty incredible! Gets pretty busy and parking is annoying but they do delivery."}
{"text":"After being under the weather all weekend, when lunch on Monday rolled around I wasn't feeling like walking in 93 degree steamy heat to get some food.  Luckily I saw that Potbelly delivers. Their online ordering process was easy to use, they delivered when promised and the order arrived complete with all the appropriate temperatures.  I got the chicken salad flatbread and a frozen strawberry lemonade.  Very tasty.  Can't wait until I feel better and the heat tones it down a notch so I can visit the shop."}
{"text":"Most Potbelly experiences I have are great; although my mother-in-law does not particularly care for them. This time...sub-par my friends. Placed an order online and my wife went to pick up. Said there were no guests in the store and are sandwiches were not even being worked on. Then they were out of the soup for my mother-in-law around 7 pm. No biggie, we substituted but did not catch that they gave us the wrong size until we got home. By the way, they made me the wrong sandwich. You got the cookies correct though, so not a complete bust."}
{"text":"Hit this spot on a lunch date with my wife.

Great sandwiches, with it's own unique twist.  Very cool decor and ambience.

Nothin mind blowing, but as a huge fan of a good sandwich, I think I have a pot in the rotation, and definitely room on the 40 man roster."}
{"text":"This Potbelly location was clean, the service was great, and parking was tight. The sandwiches were OK - nothing spectacular. I think Quiznos is better. The prices were average - about $8.00 with tax for a sandwich and chips. Be sure to ask for mayo, mustard or oil, otherwise the sandwich will be dry."}
{"text":"The Cuban Sandwich is amazing! Recently they have added this sandwich to the menu. The combination of seasoned pork, ham, pickle and mustard in a toasted roll was a delicious combination.

I am craving for another one!"}
{"text":"I was happy when I learned there would be a Potbelly opening just two blocks away from work. I really enjoyed the food at the stores in Chicago, when I was working as a consultant. This location was an epic fail, and did not do any justice to the brand. 
I ordered via the app and it crashed on me the first time.
I requested a pick up time of 1:00 -1:15 and arrived at the location a little after 1:00. I gave my name at the pickup station and waited. And waited. And waited. No one spoke to me other than to ask if I had ordered a salad (which I hadn't; I ordered the Mediterranean. Finally, one of the Sandwich artists brought my order. I asked if it had just been made (I wanted to make sure it was hot still). He said, no, they just couldn't find the order. Left the shop and went back to work. By the time I opened the bag and started to eat, the sandwich was cold and tasted like the paper it was wrapped in. So not what I expect from Potbelly's. I'll give this location one more try. If they fail again, I won't return."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a tasty sandwich.   But I don't think the value is there.   For over $5 for a 6 or 7 inch sub I'd like more stuff jammed in there.   I had the  Mediterranean and although good, there was too much bread.  I got the cookies too.  Again, very good, but not worth a buck and a quarter."}
{"text":"Davina. She has divine hands and a love for helping people out. Never in my life have a gone to Potbelly on Camelback and not seen Divina not smile when she sees me."}
{"text":"LOL. OK so I bought a bunch of Potbelly stock on their IPO day. Cramer hyped it. A lot of articles recommend the stock....I bought as a lets see what happened type investment. Then it hits me I have never been to or even seen a Potbelly sandwich shop. So off we go to Potbellys. Honest opinion..OK better than subway for sure.....better than quiznos for sure.....Jimmy Johns...equal.....so so could be better could be worse. Growth is the hype...so lets see what happens. Nothing bad food wise nothing great.......service...sandwich shop service do not make more of it then it is."}
{"text":"Pizza sandwich looks good when they're making it, but get lots of napkins-- it's a mess!

Speed is okay til someone orders a shake or or smoothie or whatnot, then the cashier has to make the shake and the whole thing goes off the rails.

And the food looks better when they're making it than how it actually tastes.

At least the employees are enthusiastic?"}
{"text":"I love sandwiches, and I like potbelly. What I don't love is the staff here. I've been twice, and each time, I was not happy. First, they all scream at you when you walk in. I get it, say hi. No need to blow out my ear drums with \"WELCOME TO POTBELLY!!!!!!\" Second, what's up with the girl with the iPad? She takes me order literally in front of the people making the sandwiches. It makes nothing go any faster and makes no sense. Finally, the rest of the staff are so clueless, it's not even funny. My sandwich came out of the toaster and they were all \"mayo mustard hot peppers?\" to which I replied \"No mayo\" Then he grabs mayo and spreads it all around. Ugh. So I asked him to remake it and he acted like I asked for the moon. Eyes rolled, heavy sigh, exasperated look. So I told him politely that I was no longer interested in eating there. I ran across the street to DiBella's and had a wonderful lunch! 

So sorry, wanted to like you, but service will prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"I was close by this restaurant and wasn't expecting a good food to be honest but , grilled chicken & cheddar was the best chicken sandwich. Never have I ever tasted this kinda of chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere with a classic pub feel. They have created tables out of the old Toronto subway sign and there are old pictures of Toronto everywhere. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich regular and I definitely thought it was worth the value. It filled me up and had such a unique taste. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service!!! Very pleased with the Italian sandwich and Farmhouse salad. Like how you can get all the nutritional info from website. Overall good experience. Great option for lunch around ASU."}
{"text":"It was great to go to this place. I am from around the Chicago area and use to go to a Potbelly's around once a week. I was really pumped up to see one here. I walked in  and ordered the wreck sandwhich and some chips. After the first bite I was hooked. I finished my food and got right back in line again and had another sandwhich.  I don't live close to this location but I will be driving up here at least once a month to go here. The service was also great."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich and an Oreo shake.  The sandwich wast toasted with fresh ingredients and I was diggin the tasty bread.  It'd be ideal if they served more toppings, like olives and green bell peppers. 

The shake was okay and a bit thinner than usual milkshakes.  I've tasted better-- not sure I'd get it again.  

The beverage station had *both* Coke & Pepsi products which should please the picky people in your group.  The service was good and the cashier was nice; offered to take our tray and trash. 

Hubs got the Roastbeef sammy with double meat. They didn't chins on the meat, which made him happy. Also loved the hot peppers. Thought the bread was awesome.  He and my mother-in-law split an ice cream sandwich made of sugar cookie and vanilla ice cream; it was really big and they said it was rich!

Seems like a mix of Quiznos & a Wich Which mix but with a drive thru and a bit of an hipster and a chain restaurant feel that is trying to add local decor flair so they don't seem so chain. Quiznos like because of the toasted sandwiches and chips and Wich Which like because of the milkshakes. 

Will go back mainly for the convenience of the drive thru if I'm nearby and want a sandwich or if I'm with the hubby and he insists."}
{"text":"I love Potbelly, especially this location. The food is wonderful and I always get great service. The place is always clean. The management staff is in the ball. I have seen them really step up and make things right if something was not made right. Things happen and mistakes can be made. It's how they are handled that matters. These guys are top notch."}
{"text":"I was excited to get Potbelly in the valley, particularly the west side. I was used to their sandwiches in Chicago. Their topping choices are pretty run of the mill ho hum but their toasted roast beef sandwich is delish! Do yourself a favor and get a hand dipped oreo milkshake and PLEASE make sure you try Sheilas Dream Bar. I'm pretty sure I went in just to get the dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and had the BIG Italian and it was fantastic! Go with the pre sliced big pickle as a side, it will not disappoint. The place was spotless, the team was very energetic, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Potbelly and I have to say it was absolutely terrible!! When we first walked in the lady that took out order was helpful and explained the different bread options.... but it was all downhill after that! We ordered 2 sandwiches on the Flat bread, a cup of soup, and a smoothie- we got our sandwiches right away but due to the poor management the lack of staff we ended up waiting 20 mins for a soup and one smoothie!! Absolutely ridiculous!! The sandwich was ok but definitely not amazing and the lack luster overall experience left me with the opinion that I won't ever be back here again which is unfortunate because I've heard great things about this restaurant chain... oh well... many more sandwich options in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten here and I was less than impressed. I had the farmhouse salad. This was supposed to come with romaine and spinach. I had literally one piece of spinach. The other lettuce was brown and old. I was given little toppings just to cover the top and a ton of bacon bits. The salad was unimpressive and I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Good - Potbelly makes great sandwiches - quite a few different options for everyone.

The Bad - This particular location is terrible.  Highly suggested to avoid this place.  Several of us had issues earlier in the year on multiple occasions with the live music being too loud at lunch time - you could barely have a conversation (this is not a bar) - and some of the staff members spent more time chatting than taking care of the customers.

Gave the location another chance - the music and prior staff issue were not issues.  The issue today was significantly worse.  Multiple people ordered \"big\" sandwiches on white bread.  After standing around for quite some time one of the people behind the counter advised that their \"fresh\" white bread was still frozen.  Not sure why that wasn't communicated when we ordered. The person making sandwiches had to ask multiple times what we ordered. My order was made as an original after they asked me... they ended up making another one as an original without asking and said they could make another original due to the break issue.  At this point close to 15 minutes had been spent with nobody else in front of us trying to get this all figured out.

If this place is going to last - they seriously need to get their customer service issues under control. This is a disappointment for the Potbelly brand."}
{"text":"Perfectly consistent with all of their locations in the north. I'm from Chicago and so it's really nice to get the same experience. Not to mention that this is probably the cheapest (but best) sandwich in the uptown area. I recommend avoiding it between 12-12:30. My gosh is it crowded."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing at catering lunches.  They are there pretty darn early, I have called at 6:30 in the morning.  Always able to have a lunch ready, as early as 10:45 once. Very easy, the food is good and the people are friendly to work with. Highly recommend a sugar cookie here!"}
{"text":"Dryest meatball sub I've ever had.  So sloppily made with marinara sauce only on half.  I ordered it \"big\" which didn't seem large at all to me compared to any other sub shop I've ever been to.  There was about an inch of bread at the end with NOTHING on it:  no meat, no sauce, no cheese - so I'm assuming I paid an extra dollar for an inch worth of plain bread since I'm not sure what their regular size is.  Very stingy on sauce and on cheese and the few mushrooms that cost an extra 50 cents.  Complete ripoff and not even as good as subway.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"visiting AZ for some baseball. super impressed with the sandwich quality and the smoothies/shakes!"}
{"text":"This is a cool sandwich ... but on retrospect, it is after all just a sandwich. It was good, and the people serving it at the counter were cool as well. All in all, it was good."}
{"text":"As I walked in on a dreary and rainy Thursday afternoon, my spirits were immediately uplifted as the soft music drifted over me.  I was wondering who was the artist when I turned and saw that he was right there sitting on a stage playing and singing with his guitar.  How great is that?!

Ah, but we are here for the food--definitely a contender against any other sub place in Madison.  Great, fresh & friendly service.  I really like the oil they have for some of their sandwiches.  And I love, love their hot peppers...I bought a whole bottle.  

A good place to stop for breakfast/lunch/dinner--and I would encourage you to dine in--anytime you are on State Street.  Not only is it a great place for food (yes breakfast too) but it's an even better place to spend time with good company."}
{"text":"I eat here every week or so. I am not a sandwich person usually but these sandwiches are amazing. The crispy just toasted bread and all of the toppings you can imagine put me in heaven. The service is always nice and very friendly, always smiling! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having potbelly's sandwiches. The staff was very nice and answered my questions without any hesitation or attitude. The prices are very fair for a good toasted sandwich. I had the turkey club and it costs a bit more because of the \"special bacon\" it was great. Didn't mind spending the little extra for it at all. I plan on coming back for another round and maybe save some room and try out the soup next time!"}
{"text":"Love it.

I wish Potbelly would expand to my neck of the woods.  I love everything about them.  Fast and delicious sandwiches, lots of drink options, and yummy cookies.  I'm partial to a variation on the meatball sandwich (though their signature sandwiches are very tasty and far more original) and sugar-cane-cola.  Subway and Quizno's should tremble at the mere notion that Potbelly could invade the coasts.  If they brought their army of friendly and capable staffers with them, they could easily take over around here."}
{"text":"When I came into town, my hubbs said we absolutely had to try Potbelly's because this was a rave from all his coworkers.  It was the Thursday before superbowl so it was busy, but definitely not jampacked on the streets yet. We were able to get in line quickly and find a table for us.  

I didn't realize how quickly we'd move through the line and I hate being that person holding up said line so I made a quick gesture towards their pizza sandwich with easy sauce. He got some sort of Italian sandwich with 2x meat. In addition, we got an oreo shake and a cup of their baked potato soup. 

I liked his sammy much more than I did mine, and I typically don't gravitate towards Italian subs. Mine was just OK, nothing that I would venture to eat again. The soup wasn't memorable either but at least the shake was pretty good. It wasn't on par with the oreo shakes at whichwich but then again, that's not surprising. 

Overall, not a bad lunch spot, and wouldn't mind trying it another time."}
{"text":"Ordered with several people in my office for pick up. I understand that things go missing when there are several orders. Everything in my order that I did receive was great! However, my berry shake was missing and I called to try to be reimbursed. I called once, explained my shake was missing and was told they would reimburse my card and then I was hung up on. No one confirmed my order number or anything information. I attempted to call back to confirm they had my order number and the information that was needed and I was hung up on again before anything could be verified. If I actually do manage to get reimbursed I'd give it a better rating because the food I did receive was good... but until then I'll be passing up ordering from this location."}
{"text":"Really good food! Sandwiches made any way I want it. Very fresh and yummy. The cookies are soooo good and soft. Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"First, this location doesn't have a big chunk of the Potbelly menu.  No farmhouse salad, no mac or potato salad, no big-sizing of the sandwiches.  The sandwiches are not large, probably just a tiny bit bigger than a Subway 6\".  

Second, my husband just pulled a huge hair out of his The Wreck(r) sandwich.  Yes, I know stuff happens at restaurants and I will call them in the morning and inform them; however...  just an FYI.

Last and perhaps most important, I'm just not a big fan of how this food tastes.  I know many other people love it so, again, just my opinion.  I have tried here the tuna, the Italian, The Wreck(r), the chili, and the shakes.  Of all of it, the chili was my favorite thing, although it's still a \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Very good. I had the pizza sub, choc chip cookie and drink for under $10. The line was long but it moved fast and I got my sandwich fast. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop near biltmore. I get the tuna or the turkey, they're both good."}
{"text":"You have to tell 3 different groups of people your order and they still cannot get your order correct.  It looks like chilli should be a daily item yet they did not have any. Out of 3 meals nothing was better than what a few minutes at home would give you at 1/3 price. Not sure it is worth giving this place another shot."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  Subway ain't got nothing on Potbelly!  Kids had skinny turkey sandwiches and I hubs and I had roast beef, me skinny and he not.

I love that whole concept of \"skinny\" where you are getting less bread and less meat but it's still super flavorful and just a little better for you.  Great tasting bread here too.

Overall, I would recommend it. Hard to mess up a sandwich, but I've seen it done.  They also have live music sometimes which is cool!"}
{"text":"I knew I had to try it when my Jimmy John's loving friend squealed with excitement, \"Move over Jimmy's, Potbelly is coming to town!\" So when I drove by it unexpectedly while looking for some dinner, I made a u-turn on Camelback and pulled right on in. 

I only have two things to say about my experience:

1) Great customer service. Everyone is so darn nice I'm scared they might be pod-people.

2. Delicious. 

Potbelly Sandwich shop, good food made by people who might be aliens."}
{"text":"I've mostly gone through the drive thru - it's a great location on my way home.  I love having the option of getting something that is not fried.  I've tried the chicken salad sandwich, roast beef sandwich, and the turkey sandwich.  They all were very good.  I keep saying I'm going to try something new (salad maybe) but keep going back to the things I know I like."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today for the first time...the shop is super cute and would be a comfortable place to sit and eat and relax. The food is the BOMB. I am a big fan of sandwiches and this place did not disappoint. I ordered the Mediterranean original size and added mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and Italian seasoning. It was toasty and delicious!! They do deliver however I am unsure of the times and area. The price is decent-to be expected. They have a lot of competition as this corner is crammed with choices. If you are in the mood for a good sub go to Potbelly!!"}
{"text":"Personally, I don't believe anyone's review when they complain about prices at a cheap sandwich shop. It's a sandwich. It's under $10. What is there to complain about? Beats the hell out of a Subway. Blarg."}
{"text":"I have loved Potbelly since I used to travel for work and spent a lot of time in Chicago.  It seemed like I was there an inordinate amount of time in the winter, wishing I had 3 pairs of thermal chonies on.  I could always count on Potbelly to have a tasty hot sandwich and some delicious soup to warm me up.  

I was thrilled to see they opened up fairly close to my house.  Now, what is not so nice is their parking situation.  It is small and all clogged up with construction gear.  They are finishing up the other businesses in this building and then it should be smooth sailing.  For now, especially if you go at peak times, take your patience.  I went at 1:30 today and it was full, and I had to look out for a woman driving in the middle of the lot as I came out of the drive-thru, and then wait for 2 guys with NuCO2 to get their shirts tucked in and their peaches rearranged before they got in their truck and got out of the way.  

Everything else is great.  I almost always get the roast beef and provolone, or the meatball.  I did try their star sandwich, A Wreck, and thought it was just okay.  My husband gets their Italian and that one has a lot of flavor with all those delicious Italian meats on it.  

The soups I've tried are good too.  If they have the loaded baked potato I'll get that, otherwise the broccoli cheddar is a great choice as well.  

Now, for the best part of the meal...the chocolate brownie cookie.  These things are amazing.  They are big cookies, but I recommend getting one all for yourself.  Those are one of my favorite cookies ever.  They taste just like a brownie but have a nice crisp cookie edge.  I think I ate my last one too fast.  I need to save half for tomorrow.  Yeah.  Like that's going to happen.  

The app has given me some nice perks, and the staff at this location have always been friendly, helpful, and ask good questions to make sure they have my order correct.  My only complaint is the parking, and that will fix itself soon enough."}
{"text":"Best part of Midway Airport in Chicago, best part about Biltmore in Phoenix. Great sandwiches and treats. Try it a few times, you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Went to order a raspberry lemonade frostie but they were so understaffed that the guy behind the counter literally told me no because he didn't feel like making it. What?"}
{"text":"was on vacation and staying about a block away--nice sandwich place--could use some more cheese on the sandwiches when you order them with cheese.  Fast and tasted good."}
{"text":"I dream about Potbelly's Italian sandwhich smothered with hot peppers. 

It's probably one of the best sandwhiches I've ever eaten in my entire life. The only that sucks about it is, I eat it so fast It's gone. 

On more than one occasion I've wanted to order another one. But as much as I like Potbelly, I sure don't want one! 

I've been a handful of times and everytime it's pretty busy. I've told so many people about this place and that they have to go. When they tell me they've gone here, they say they love it.

I've not tried any other sandwhiches they have here. But I think if I do, it would be the PB and J."}
{"text":"Came here after Comic Con today. Super helpful and friendly staff. Like over the top helpful when we were trying to figure out how to get back into the parking garage.

Thought the sandwich was pretty decent but not stellar. But the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and the magic bar were fantastic. And double thumbs up for the fact that this seems to be a 100% peanut free establishment. Love when I don't have to worry about having an allergic reaction. Would come again for the desserts!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and professional. We are about to leave because we didn't see any toddler  friendly options for my one-year-old but the gentleman suggested a grilled cheese. So we went with that suggestion but we didn't know how thick the bread would be. She couldnt chew it. Every table was dirty.  Garbage cans were all over flowing. Sandwiches were mediocre. We probably wont return. I do want to emphasize how kind of stuff was though. Despite the uncleanliness."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy for the Tummy!

Split the \"Wreck\" (roast beef, ham, salami and swiss cheese) and a meatball sandwich with hubby.  You customize your sandwich with your choice of bread and a selection of condiments (mayo, mustard, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomato, etc.).  They even toast the rolls.  Although both sandwiches were yummy, in our opinion the Wreck was the winner.  A reviewer suggested adding bacon, but I thought it was perfect as is.

Some reviews I read compared Potbelly to Quiznos, Subway or Capriotti's.    No comparison.....Potbelly is so much better!  The only drawback was the sandwiches were a little on the small side for hubby, but the perfect size for me.

Hopefully I will be able to squeeze in a return visit before I leave.  Any possibility a Potbelly will be headed to Southern CA anytime soon?"}
{"text":"I decided to give the \"pick-up\" feature a try. It was great! I ordered my Italian on Flatbread with BBQ chips and a chocolate chip cookie... ok so I didn't need the cookie but I dare you to try one and not order one everytime you go! I walked in and told the cashier I ordered online, she asked my name... and about 10 seconds later she comes up with my order! It was perfect by the way. :-) Thank you yelp and Potbelly's for making it so easy. I was in and out in less than 5 min. It actually took me longer to park."}
{"text":"Had the Wreck on multi grain... it was ok.  I dont remember anything special about. I'll try a few more and edit my review accordingly."}
{"text":"My first time at this place, I had the Italian sub it was OK at best not much flavor glad I got the vinaigrette to dunk it in for a little flavor. Not worth the 6$ I paid for it, I will stick with DIBELLA'S haven't found a place yet that can compete with there subs!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this a place today, thinking it would be a nicer, fast casual sort of place where one can customize sandwiches in whatever way they please (kind of like, say, Sandwich Box).  Nope, that wasn't the case.  I basically had to order from the small selection of what they had on their menu (with only two types of bread to choose from).  I chose a chicken and cheese sandwich, minus the chicken (basically, a grilled cheese) with toppings.  The topping selection was minimal - Subway has much more to choose from!  I added cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce, no sauce (sauce selection was pretty blah).  One would think there'd be some kind of flavour, even without spreads and sauces (I mean, really, mustard and mayo?????!!!!  I think delis have more choice.  Subway, definitely), with cheese and all.  Nope, the entire thing was bland.  

I don't know, maybe this place is good for kids, but definitely not that great for adults, especially those of us who are more foodie-like.  I have to admit that I'd rather go to Subway than this place.  More flavour there.  And better on the wallet, too.  At least the coffee is Balzac's."}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly staff. I had the chocolate, banana milkshake and my bro in law had the chocolate oreo milkshake.  These were mixed perfectly from top to bottom and the flavor lasted to the very last drop.  The dining room is hip, clean and appealing.  Everything was kept up well and invitingly displayed.  We may be back if time allows this weekend."}
{"text":"Decent subs, all made better with hot peppers.
Nothing spectacular - but not bad at all.

The place itself is inoffensive, plenty of seating and is always clean.

The staff is all friendly and well trained, the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are downright addictive - and the New Orleans fiend that I am is always happy to buy at least two bags of Zapp's chips. (Today was original and BBQ ranch.)

I'm not in a sub mood very often, but today it sounded better than any of the other nearby quick service places. It hit the spot - so no complaints from me."}
{"text":"Ordered the TKY sandwhich with everything on it through the drive-though and when I got home and opened it up there was nothing on the bread but meat. This place isnt close to my house by any means and we travel out of the way to go here but usually we like it a lot. Super disappointed and wont be back. Make sure and check your sandwiches if you go here through the drive through.

The manager actually mailed me some coupons to make good on this issue. Great customer service. Accidents happen!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop place around. This franchise is out of Chicago. Used to eat there all the time when they had just 1 location. I highly recommend this place to get away from the boring sandwich chains"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Potbelly in my neck of the woods. My first experience trying a Potbelly was in Chicago (where they got their start in the 70's). I am such a sucker for delis that have good soup. They keep things pretty low key here by using simple quality ingredients for their Original, Flat or Skinny sandwiches. They have a variety of sandwich creations you can choose from. My personal favorite is A Wreck - salami, roast beef, oven roasted turkey and smoked ham covered with Swiss cheese. But this time I decided to try their pizza sandwich and chicken pot pie soup for lunch with my buddy from Chicago (how ironic). The pot pie soup is pretty amazing and I highly recommend you try it. They have other soup choices, chilis, salads, chips and a craft-your-own Mac & Cheese to go along with your sandwich. Shakes, smoothies and their always popular freshly baked cookies are also on the menu (one of these days I'll try that Dream Bar). The lines move pretty quickly but can be a hit-or-miss on busy days. They probably get a good lunch rush being located just west of Chandler Fashion Square Mall and a bunch of local businesses. My service was good and I'll stop in again sometime."}
{"text":"My favorite HOT sandwich place. I highly recommend the Mediterranean sandwich with grilled chicken. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches - Just okay service.

Let me preface this review by saying that I recently moved back to the Madison area from Chicago, where I lived within walking distance of a Potbelly and ate there way more often than I really should admit. While pregnant with my second child I probably ate there twice a week.  What can I say?  I'm a little obsessed. Their sandwiches are great. Their salads are great. Their soup is great. Their shakes - you guessed it, great. ;)  All that being said, the East Side location needs to step up their game a bit.  I've eaten there a few times and a) it took FOREVER to get my sandwich - I think I could have probably jumped behind the counter and made it faster and b)I've had a few errors with my meal...things forgotten, ingredients incorrect, etc.  So - 4 stars it is - because bad service or not, I'd still eat there twice a week if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"the sandwiches are ok. do not order online. no matter what cc you use they will use the same one. even if you delete it."}
{"text":"First time at at Pot Belly. Arrived at noon on a Saturday and it was 1/4 full. Hmm. 

I ordered A Wreck, which had salami, roast beef, turkey, ham and Swiss. No frills, just a sandwich. 

It certainly wasn't the worst sandwich I've had but definitely not the best. The dressing, a bit messy, seemed to be a cross between mayo and Italian dressing. Not sure. The peppers were a nice touch but you have to have a good foundation and I wasn't enamored with the bread. I got a white roll but it lacked character that you get at Port of Subs, Jimmy Johns and others. 

My son said his sandwich was forgettable and we left not knowing if we would return. 

I will but will try a different sandwich. Maybe their signature deal isn't my style?"}
{"text":"So I love the location of this place but will I be coming back, probably not. I dropped in at 5 o'clock on Friday and there were three people in the restaurant, one behind the counter. He was friendly and gave me the rundown on their offerings since I've never been into a Potbelly Sandwich shop before. He suggested the Italian sub and it was tasty but pretty expensive, for what you get and nothing out of the ordinary.  You have so many choices at this intersection... You really have to stand out."}
{"text":"website offers delivery at this location but you have to call.
When you call, they tell you its a $25 minimum order to have it delivered....
They should update their site to say CATERING ORDERS for delivery.. sheesh"}
{"text":"Great Wreck! I used to work in DC and eat from some huge Potbelly stores. This place, by comparison, is tiny. But the food quality appears the same. I have been here 3-4 times since opening and am happy with the service and food quality."}
{"text":"This place rocks! This was my first time trying this place with a bunch of co-workers. We ordered 9 separate orders to-go (a few of the orders had a lot of \"complexities\" to them). When I went to pickup the staff was friendly and efficient. The location is convenient and easy to get to. The lady helping me wasn't frustrated at all (or she hid it well) that I needed to pay with 9 different credit cards - I really appreciated this. The most shocking part - the order was correct - not one mistake or forgotten item! Totally impressed! This was even in the midst of their very busy lunch rush (it seems like they get a lot of to-go and delivery orders).

The sandwiches are great (much better than other sandwich chain competitors), their soups are great...the malts are awesome...the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are AMAZING! These things are so good that I went back after I got off of work to buy more of them before flying home. I bought every single oatmeal chocolate chip cookie left in that place!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time yesterday and loved it! I didn't know what to get so I let the staff recommend some options. I ended up getting a Oreo smoothie and the Farmhouse salad. The smoothie was really good (but I think it's just a milkshake) and the salad was good too. I didn't know what kind of dressing to get so when he recommended ranch I chose that one. All in all it was a great experience and I'll definitely go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place! The price is aggressive 4.80 on avg and the place is clean and great service. I tried their tuna Sandwich and was thrilled! I am picky about tuna but there is is perfect and I actually cant stop thinking about it.  The sandwiches are about 6 inches are all toasted. YUMMY! they serve milkshakes and some salads as well. This is definitely in my rotation for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time. We would definitely return! Subs were warm, multi grain bread was yummy, and the brownie cookie was OMG!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches taste fine but the servings are small and the menu is really lacking variety."}
{"text":"Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  \"Italian\" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a \"Pizza Sandwich\" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called \"Bigs\", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken with cheddar sandwich which was recommended by the people at the shop. The sandwich was good but not delicious as the ones from wich wich. The sandwich was mild, less toppings were put however the toasted bread and the chicken made it taste better. I would not recommend this place for vegetarians at all."}
{"text":"We stopped by on our way home for a quick dinner. They offer a basic sandwich selection and decent variety of drinks and sodas. I had the grilled chicken and cheddar, my son had the Italian, and my husband had the pizza sandwich. The sandwiches were good but they seemed a bit light on the meat, especially the pizza sandwich. The bread however was very good. Toasted but still soft and chewy. It was 6:30 and they were out of ice cream so we couldn't try a shake but if we are ever on the area again and craving a sandwich we might just stop in again.

3 sandwiches and 3 sodas was approximately $26.00."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sandwiches are great, some of the best on Green St. and the service is pretty fast, too."}
{"text":"People are always friendly! AcutalIy am not sure why I am writing a review, I should be over there eating a sandwich! :)"}
{"text":"Potbelly's is a one of a kind sandwich shop, that our family loves!  

I tend to vacillate between which toasted sandwich I like best.  The Wreck, which is Salami, Roast Beef, Turkey, Ham & Swiss Cheese, or the Roast Beef, which is thinly Sliced Angus Beef and Provolone Cheese.  Friend and fellow Yelp'er King Scott prefers The Wreck.  As you will find, both are very good.  Potbelly also has soups and various sides, like macaroni and potato salad, chips and whole pickles.  If you are pregnant, I guess this is the place to come and eat.

I believe Potbelly's price and sandwich size are just right, one of King Scott's kids likes to jokingly call them Empty-belly. Their perceived small size (7 inches) or not, $4.70 is more than fair for something this good.  You can decide.  Back in Illinois, where Potbelly was started, they carry a larger size simply called: \"Bigs\", that are thirty percent larger.  On our visit, we were told they would soon carry the larger size as well.  Nice!

Like most Potbellys, this one too has a potpourri of visual candy.  My favorite is the faux movie poster called \"Bedtime for Brezhnev\", of former President Reagan and Soviet leader Brezhnev.  It's located over the booth area, opposite from where you order (see photo).

Another nice touch is the live music that Potbelly offers, this day we had a guitar player.  It's fun and makes the Potbelly experience unique.

If your waist line allows it, I would also recommend their Shakes and Malts.  I've been told by others that they're delicious!

FYI, there are three locations here in the Valley, including this one.  You can also go to: 534 W McDowell, or One East Washington.  Both are in Phoenix.  A new location will be opening soon on North Scottsdale Road, near Thunderbird.  Very nice.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Potbelly has the best tuna sandwich in the whole wide world. Their Oreo shakes are even better. But why a 3 star you ask? It is because they don't have KETCHUP. That's like a must for every KETCHUP lover. Sorry but please provide me with KETCHUP."}
{"text":"Decided to try out and it was very delicious employees were very outgoing and fun and has great sitting area to enjoy."}
{"text":"My lack of excitement could be in part that I was set on trying Snooze AM next door, but it was almost an hour wait and since it was noon and I was already in the verge of a coma from not eating this was the next option. 

They have a handful of sandwiches to choose from. Nothing super unique or standout, but a good solid menu. 
I got the chicken salad, which to me was plain. I got it with all the toppings except mayo and mustard and oil. It just didn't have any oomph to it that chicken salad needs. However the bread was fantastic and therefore not a total loss. The rest of the party thought there sandwiches were good. Not amazing, but good. For the price not bad, but I won't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and was looking for a quick drive thru meal. Never been to a Potbelly's before. I was struggling to decide what to order, when a tall, dark, curly haired cashier helped me decide and made some recommendations. I didn't get his name! I highly recommend \"A Wreck\" with mayo and lettuce. Yum! They were patient with me and made great food! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Potbelly is and always will be one of the best  sandwich shops around! I don't have a problem with the food but with the service I received. I was the only one in the shop and there was only one worker I could see. When I went in she was wiping down the tables and told me she would be right with me in a second I told her it was fine because I didn't know what I wanted yet. She continued to wipe down tables for another 5 minutes which I mean okay I get it but I'm the only one in there can't you finish when I'm done ordering. Once she finished she then said she'll be right back and disappeared for another 5 minutes. At this point I was about to leave when she finally appeared again. She didn't apologize or anything just took my order. While doing so it looked as if she was annoyed. When it came to checking out I have their app and has received a free cookie so I mentioned it to her and she gave me a look and just stared at me. I had it pulled up and she grabbed my phone from me then told me to grab a cookie. I then grabbed my food and left. I couldn't believe a process that should only take maybe 5 minutes went on for 15 minutes. I was just trying to grab a quick sandwich after work."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sandwich.  I like how they cut the meatballs in half so it spreads over the sandwich more and not just this huge lump of meat with bites of just bread in between.  I love the hot peppers they have too.

There was a hair in my sandwich.. but other than that I'd probably recommend the place."}
{"text":"I am torn between a 3 star and 4 star rating. Not a bad sandwich. Especially if you like it toasted. I had the turkey swiss with thin sliced bread (1/3 less bread)...which is nice for the carbs. The ordering process is a bit annoying when you get asked 3 times what you ordered. Perhaps they need better training. Turkey swiss was good. A step up from Subways. Ok..  I will give you 4 stars."}
{"text":"Really good food! I love the bread! The chicken salad salad is my fav I like that there's a drive through, always good customer service, which is a plus! The only thing I have to complain about is the smoothie is actually just a shake- the only difference is the shakes are made with ice cream and the smoothies are made with frozen yogurt ? I went two different times to get a strawberry smoothie and thought they messed up my order, thinking I wanted a strawberry shake but come to find out that's the only difference. So I wish the smoothies were more like a smoothie and not more like a shake- since they already have shakes on their menu. But great food!"}
{"text":"We were going to start our drive for our weekend getaway and stopped here to get some food. We were the ONLY family there ordering, yet they decided to waste so much time trying to find apple sauce for my daughter they messed up her sandwich and gave us no chips. We were irritated for the amount of time we waited for an explanation of what they were doing so we left with our food. On the road then we discovered their error. Too late to turn back and this point I don't think we will be coming back. They were so unorganized and frazzled for it being empty in there. I could totally understand if it was a rush of people in there but there wasn't."}
{"text":"I've been waiting, and waiting, and now finally, Christmas has come early this year. 

Potbelly has finally opened in Chandler!  \"Yippee Ki Yay\", (you know the rest). LOL

Nearly five years ago, I wrote a Yelp Review about their new Scottsdale location \"that Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00. (Now, $5.85)

\"Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place, that is known primarily for their Wreck sub.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. 

\"They also have two similar subs called:  \"Italian\" with Capicola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami with Provolone cheese, and a \"Pizza Sandwich\" which has many of the same cuts of deli meat, but comes with marinara sauce.\"

Okay, my Midwest bias aside, Potbelly's is familiar in many ways to other sandwich/sub places, yet very different. In the beginning, they had local musicians playing in their shoppes. 

I believe that feature is gone now. But their pressed tin ceilings, potbelly stove (Really? In Arizona?) and all of the eccentric posters and pictures, make it a fun trip

I started a small argument in my office today, when I mentioned this location was open. Seemed everyone had their own idea on what make Potbelly special. The consensus was, the Wreck and their Shakes. Go figure. 

So my Sitrep is that Potbelly combines a very well made, tasty Parisian bread, that is lightly toasted with premium cold cuts. Then throw in some spicy Giardiniera (Chicago style hot peppers), some condiments, rabbit food, etc and Bingo - you have a Potbelly sub. 

Btw, Potbelly's comes in two sizes, Regular - about 6 1/2\" and Bigs, which I taped measured at 10\". See photo. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have loved Potbelly's since I found them in Chicago years ago! The best sandwich shop around, especially with all the choices in the area.  I think they pack quite a punch of flavor at a reasonable price. However, I'm heartbroken they took away the potato salad, even though the flavor had changed some since my visit in Chicago. The manager of the store is super awesome with a great crew. Bottom line- Do it!"}
{"text":"The food was great, as was the service. I Wanted to try it after passing by ,it for a while now. Great taste. Their \"Bigs\" sandwich is really not all that big but very good. Great outdoor sitting area and perfect location. The prices are crazy high for the amount of food you get but the taste is right!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for dinner before a concert and since we waited to the last minute most places were already booked or over an hour wait. The only place we could find was Potbelly Sandwich Shop..... there was no wait here  and only a few people even sitting down eating at the scattered tables and chairs. This place reminds me of a Subway shop. 

They have a large menu on the wall, it was tough making a decision...so many sandwiches to choose from. Ultimately I went with a version of the pizza sandwich, pepperoni,  melted swiss cheese, onions, light sauce on a toasted flatbread. When the gentleman putting my sandwich together asked what type of bread I wanted, I said I didn't care and he could choose.... he picked the flatbread and it was really good. 

Overall this place is ok, super fast to grab a bite, very affordable  But this was not my idea of a restaurant for dinner this is a lunch place or just a snack...They don't serve alcohol or any other side dishes. Make sure if your in town for a concert or game make reservations... don't make my mistake."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to grab a great sandwich. The italian with hot peppers is my go-to. However, skip placing an online order in an effort to save time. A small group of us (5) placed an online order to pick up and waited 20 minutes after the \"ready\" time to pick it up. We watched the regular sandwich line customers move through the line 4 or 5 times over before we were eventually provided with our order placed online. Had our order not have already of been paid for online,  it would have made more sense for us to stand in line and order our sandwiches with the lunch hour rush. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwiches - okay, don't care for the bread, wouldn't order again
Broccoli cheese soup - yummy, wish I had gotten a bowl instead of cup
Oatmeal chocolate chip cookie - okay, not as sweet as I would like, won't order again
Coffee milkshake - delicious, amazing, yummy, must have
Fresh brewed iced tea - yeah!  yum

This place was super busy on Friday at lunch time.  Many people coming over from convention center.  I highly recommend you call in your order.  Otherwise the line was out the door."}
{"text":"This location still gets four stars, and my review hasn't changed too much, but I just wanted to remark that the last few times I've been here, I've ordered online, and I've ordered my sandwich with avocado. When I open my sandwich? No avocado. Disappointing, as avocado is an upcharge.

The staff continues to be quite courteous and responsive, but I won't order avocado here because of this issue."}
{"text":"Friendly courteous staff, walked me through the ordering process, sort of entertaining..
The Italian on multigrain wheat roll was epic. 
Best Sandwich in Phoenix, hands down."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, so I haven't had that many different things, but I enjoy this place! It's also in a great location. The broccoli cheddar soup is really good and I also really like the Italian sandwich. It's also good that you get to pick and choose which topping you want while it's in front of you (kinda like Subway, but better). Also, MILKSHAKES and MALTS! I hadn't had a malt in years until this place! Sometimes the tables are a bit dirty, like several people have eaten at them without them being wiped down afterwards, but I get that it can get busy and that college students aren't always the most aware of the mess they make for others..."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time here and both times were disappointing. The chicken salad and turkey were dry and bland. In addition, they don't offer Dijon mustard and they ran out of iced tea and couldn't even refill our tea from behind the counter even though they have a drive through. 
Service was friendly, the restaurant was clean but we don't feel like it's worth coming back to."}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUMMY!!! They have some of the nicest people working here. My experience was AWESOME!!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I love Potbelly because they cater to many preferences When it comes to sandwiches. It seems like there is something for everyone. I recently just had the \"TKY\". It's turkey and Swiss sandwich, I added mushrooms and it was fantastic. Maybe choose to add mayo or thousand island as well.
Very friendly staff, everyone had a smile on their face."}
{"text":"It was fine, but nothing special.  The food was good, the staff was nice.  I was just hoping for a little more pizzazz or something special to set them apart from all the other sandwich shops.

I won't seek this place out, but if someone else wants to meet there I won't say no."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Yup. I'm pretty sure you can say that. I'm a huge fan of almost any toasted sandwich and when I'm feeling thrifty and/or I need to drop a few I make it last a couple days. Also the chickpea salad. It's huge!!!!! I love my veggies and I tend to add everything I can to it. The Potbelly Vin is also delicious. They don't skimp and the staff is always friendly. No-brainer for an easy in and out lunch. So glad they are downtown!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up by my work I have frequented it.  The subs are the perfect lunch size and not expensive at all. 

They have a new sub called the clubby that is tasty as all hell.  Ham, turkey, bacon, ranch with lettuce tomato and onion.  All around awesomeness on a bun if you ask me.  

Their shakes are bomb diggity too and the selection of bottles soda is amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped at this location a few times for lunch, decent sandwiches, decent prices, fast service, clean establishment. $2.20 for a beverage is a bit much but that's the way it is everywhere now. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm from Chicago, so I have gone to Potbellys for YEARS....even before they were this big sandwich chain. I love that this location keeps things consistent and the food is great. I love going here. I especially love that this location is open an hour later than most other locations. The employees are always nice and this is definitely one of my regular spots now that I've made the move to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Another one of our staple stops for a quick bite on the way home. My boyfriend orders a soup and sub at least 3 times a week from this location and always is extremely happy. Sadly today he came home, took a big bite and it was full of peppers which he hates :( already settled in not wanting to go back, I gave them a call and instantly was greeted by Kailey who took complete control of the situation, offered every solution possible- and made us regulars feel important. She even thanked me at the end for letting her make it right. Thanks for making it right Kailey! Side note-if you like spice get the peppers-fb was sweating after one accidental bite lol"}
{"text":"Really 4 stars or less by other reviewers?  Maybe your taste buds are warped from eating at subway and Jimmy Johns too much. 

For a sub shop this place is the best.  Went in for a quick bite after a relaxing evening of shopping around the corner and I wasn't disappointed by the food.  

I had the turkey on wheat (around $4.50 and added mushrooms for .50.  I got big slices of artichoke hearts added for free as well as lettuce, tomato, oil, and seasonings.  Best sub I've had hands down.  Also had a cup of cream of broccoli and it was delish.  My friend had the vegetable soup.  It was creamy (instead of brothy) and smelled spicy.  She loved it.

Would have tried a shake but I was too full and I could barely finish my sandwich and soup.  Next time I'll skip the soup or share a Sandwich so I have room for the shake.   

Potbelly is primarily in Illinois and on the east cost.  I'll wager a lot of the good reviews are from people who lived on the east cost, and a lot of the negative reviews are from westerners.  It really does make a difference."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, but the food is really good and because the people who work there are so nice and helpful plus the other reviews were not so flattering, I really felt like I had to post a review.

We arrived late on a Friday night after a hockey game.  I never had been here and asked for some recommendations. They recommended the Wreck and Gilled Chicken and Cheddar.  I ordered the Wreck and really enjoyed eating it with my dad and brother.  We all talked about how we were surprised at how good the food was!  We tried to go back the next day for breakfast (Saturday), but they didn't open until 11am."}
{"text":"Great employees, will listen carefully to any adjustments you want made to your order. I had the Uptown salad and it was actually one of my favorite salads from what I've encountered. Nice location and fast service with some nice art hanging around the room. Just your typical chain with no surprises or disappointments."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite sandwich shop! The pizza sandwich is delicious & the sugar cookies are to die for! The staff is always friendly & helpful. I just wish there was one closer to us!"}
{"text":"It was only okay. It was a standard toasted sub sandwich place. The restaurant was clean and cutely decorated. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't something that would make me want to go back again. I will say though, their milkshakes are good."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches with affordable prices. We do the drive thru at least weekly. It's better than fast food but easy for late nights with no time to cook."}
{"text":"So I was going to order online , then ran into a problem so I called to ask and at first they answered the phone so nicely , then when I was in the middle of asking a question the guy said \"sorry ma'am were really...I have to hang up \" and then hung up."}
{"text":"Potbelly is my all-time favorite chain sandwich shop, but this location definitely stands out. The employees are always friendly, the drive through is always efficient, and my order is always correct! My go-to is the TKY + avocado (the avocados here are always perfectly ripe - YASS!)"}
{"text":"The Italian sandwich here was very good - easily better than Subway, Blimpies, or places like that. The toasty goodness puts it up there with Quiznos or Cheba Hut - I'd say those guys have the edge on variety, but this place wins overall, including price and freshness.

The menu is pretty limited - only one size sandwich, two types of bread, and not a lot of sauces or spreads. But you can tell they put quality ingredients into what they do.

I also enjoyed an Oreo malt, which was delicious, along with some delicious jalapeño potato chips that I didn't recognize the brand.

It's a nice atmosphere, seems friendly, and would definitely be a place I'd go back to."}
{"text":"So wanted to grab a bite before the Dbacks game and we dropped in here. Looked okay. We both had the pizza sandwich and we were both disappointed. It was not good. It wasn't gross but it wasn't good.
It was our first time at Potbelly so we're not ready to write it off yet. We just hope the next time we take a chance they'll show us something good.
Should have gone to Subway tonight."}
{"text":"I've visited Potbelly many times and usually order the Chickpea Salad, add chicken.  I opted for the Mediterranean Flatbread Sandwich with Chicken on this visit and was not particularly impressed, especially for the price.   The actual flatbread was good, but there was a flavored hummus spread, with peppers, feta (which I really didn't taste) and a few strips of chicken.  The sandwich was then served warm.   The warmed hummus really didn't do it for me.   Also the portion was not particularly satisfying.  I'll continue to return to Potbelly, but wouldn't get the flatbread sandwich."}
{"text":"Very bomb sandwich place choose this place over Jimmy John's and Subway. The milkshakes are great you can combine two flavors of your choosing and they're very tasty! I also love how they can toaster subs through toaster to make them toasty!"}
{"text":"Always super friendly people here!  You are greeted like a person, not another number in the line... Great questions and offerings when customizing your order!  Be sure to say Hi to Kristen the GM, she is usually right at the front with a great big SMILE!!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving a delicious vegetarian sandwich, this is the place I go!

Potbelly's have been popping up everywhere over the last year. So I decided to stop in and I was not disappointed. The sandwiches are toasted and the portions are pretty decent. If you are looking for a sandwich bigger than your head, I would head somewhere else.

Their menu is pretty diverse. I got the Mediterranean which consisted of hummus and various vegetables. They all blended so perfectly with one naother.

They also have milkshakes!!! Get the oreo shake, they use quality ingredients and you can taste it. Plus they top it with cute little cookies that just add to the experience. 

There is plenty of seating inside and out. So come on in for a delicious sandwich, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a good hot sandwich place.  They make it in front of you.  One person puts on the meats then puts it in the oven coveyer belt.  When it comes out the other side the second employee puts on the lettuce, tomato dressings, etc.  The bread is fresh and tasty.  The hot giardinerra is delish.  The one problem I have is this location seems to always be out of something.  The last visit the soda machine didn't work and they said they were out of CO2.  Come on guys get it together!  They had no cookies which are usually delish as well.   The sandwich seems to be getting smaller and smaller and the amount of giardinerra that they put on the sandwich seems to shrink every time.  They put the end of the tomato on my sandwich which is just cheap!  I would give 5 stars if they improved their operations because I love the Italian on white bread it's tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken salad sandwich (which is hard to find these days) and fast drivethru which is convenient."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick lunch in North Scottsdale. I get the Italian sandwich and I like that I can get the bread thin-sliced. It's always the perfect amount of food for lunch without over stuffing you. The employees are always incredibly cheerful and helpful!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Potbelly Sandwich shop was opening up in Phoenix.  I had grabbed a delicious sandwich from Potbelly many times while on the east coast and always loved their simple but great approach to sandwiches.

I had the ham and cheddar on multi-grain bread with mustard, tomatoes, pickles and hot peppers...It was so good!  The hot peppers sure do have a kick and really complimented the sandwich!  I recommend adding the hot peppers to any sandwich, only if you can take the heat!  If you really like the hot peppers, you can purchase your own jar for $6.95! It was their 2nd day open so some of the workers were still getting use to the feel of the place but you really cant fault them for that!

This will be a place I return!  Thank you Potbelly for coming to the Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I saw they added a Potbelly to North Scottsdale. Today was my second visit. 

I had the Chicken and Cheddar sandwich, it's very basic. Chicken, Cheese, Bread (lettuce, tomato, pickles) but it was phenomenal. I also added a cup of vegetable soup which was surprisingly very tasty. 

I ordered online this time, my sandwich was ready but they still needed to scoop the soup which I appreciated. Nothing worse than cold soup."}
{"text":"slim caucasian boy was very rude to me while i was in potbelly but decided not to eat there due to his attitude which made me feel unwanted as a customer. he also threw my mac and cheese on the counter to give it to me. will never eat there again"}
{"text":"First time eating at a Potbelly shop. To be honest, I came here because I was looking at stocks to invest in and I read that Potbelly was good. 

My impression? They are so good that I feel bad for the Wildflower bread company a few shops down. Don't get me wrong, Wildflower is good, and is great for business lunches or perhaps bringing your parents to; but for the average Joe who just wants a cheap, delicious, lunch, you can't compete with Potbelly in terms of price vs quality. I think Potbelly will steal a lot of customers away from Wildflower who don't feel like paying 7-10 bucks for a sandwich. 

Great place. Amazing chicken and cheddar sandwich."}
{"text":"When Potbelly's opened up last school year, a whole new world was opened up to me.

In the past I had only ever had Potbelly's when I visited my cousin in Chicago, and boy did I look forward to eating there. They really aren't your average sandwich shop. They have much better bread and even feature decent soups and salads. The selections are much tastier than the rival Subway, or Jimmy Johns.

What really separates Potbelly's apart from the competitions are the milkshakes. Not just having the milkshakes, but the way they taste makes a world of difference. Out of all the Oreo milkshakes I've ever had, Potbelly definitely ranks with the best of them.
--

This location is no different from what any other Potbelly's should be. The staff is really friendly and fun to joke around with, while still delivering on the order in a timely fashion.

Finally tried the Wreck! Don't follow in my footsteps...of waiting so long to try it, that is!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed it. They have lots of options. The service was great too. All the ingredients were high quality as well. Perfect spot to get some greens and protein."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches for a good price. The menu is shorter but the sandwiches are made right in front of you and then put through the toaster. Potbelly is comparable to a Subway but has more of a home feel. I would have never known what this place was until my friend told me. The name Potbelly really threw me off!

I had tried out the wreck, very tasty, and the meat was extremely thin sliced. As for condiments, I asked for a variety of some lettuce, onions, tomato and oil and vinegar...  Apparently they don't have vinegar!!! That's a staple and needs to be at every Potbelly!"}
{"text":"Two big thumbs up for the new location! On top of the wonderful new construction smell (which I love) on the interior of the restaurant, the new location offers a nice patio with outdoor seating. I like the new location's patio because it has a few trees nearby and because it doesn't have all of the 151 Highway road noise like the patio at the old Potbelly location.

The staff people are warm and inviting. Everyone has a big smile on their face, and they're all quite friendly. 

Very tasty sandwiches! I always like to get the tuna salad on flatbread. Potbelly's tuna salad tastes fresh and has a balanced tuna/mayo ratio -- it's not overloaded and gloppy with mayo.

During lunch on Saturdays -- and perhaps other days, although I'm not sure -- an acoustic guitar player plays music inside Potbelly. While I like the concept of the live music, I think he is a little too loud inside the restaurant. That's where the nice patio comes into play.

Potbelly is my favorite sandwich shop in Madison. This restaurant is consistent with good service and good-quality sandwiches."}
{"text":"A bite form our full experience review 
\"Potbelly Sandwich restaurant is a curious substitute for a traditional sandwich shop for not that much of a premium price. Adding alcoholic bevs, live music and a hip vibe to the mix is an awesome bonus to an already compelling option.\""}
{"text":"The chicken and cheddar sandwich is amazing! I added the hot peppers (spicy but delicious). Great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich...oh mah Lord. This hit the spot! Friendly service, smells scrumptious, the place is clean, and there's an awesome selection of New Orleans flavored potato chips. A bit pricy for toasted subs, but I thought the quality of ingredients and choices made up for that. This is an elevated sandwich shop, with nostalgic wall art without being obnoxiously hipster. And they cater. Just try it, don't overthink it, it's sandwiches done right. Nick Cage approved. You'll see what I mean when you peruse the walls."}
{"text":"Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place. 

I am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Great people working here. I made a mistake on my order and was prepared to live with it, but the woman insisted that it be remade to my liking. That pretty much sealed the deal for my return. The gentleman who rung me up was really nice and helpful. And patient. And the sandwich I ordered was amazing! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today. Super friendly employees, & the chips were delicious. Sad to say that I wasn't a fan of their hummus, which comes on one of the only vegetarian sandwiches they've got, & the chocolate brownie cookie I got was hard & crispy. I may come back to try a shake & something different though"}
{"text":"The set up is a bit confusing, where you order on the other end rather than the cash registers. You kind of have to repeat your orders like 3 times. I didn't care too much for the food here. My husband gets the wreck it or whatever. The kids got a turkey sandwich and I got the uptown salad. The lettuce was wilted in my salad. Can't say I'd go again."}
{"text":"Not too bad.

For some reason, I was expecting braised porkbelly sandwiches,  It's named after a potbelly stove...doi!  

The place has plenty of seating in addition to outdoor tables and chairs.  We ordered a meatball sandwich, an Italian, and turkey on fresh baked wheat...usual deli style stuffs.  If you're looking for a good and affordable quick sandwich place ($4.70+), check this place out."}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighborhood for a few years but never ate Pot Belly...until tonight. I was pleasantly surprised at the VERY tasty \"The Wreck\" sandwich and the prompt and friendly service. The store layout itself is a bit odd, but I will know better the next visit. I had it for takeout and it stayed warm (actually my home is a short distance away.) I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This may be a chain, but it's a good one. My wife and I are big fans of the cookies, of which they're always out. Seriously. We went to two Potbellys while we were in Illinois, and both were out of the cookies we wanted. Anyway, I had the roast beef sandwich. Simple, tasty, I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. Wish we had Potbelly in Orlando..."}
{"text":"I liked the sandwich. The Mac & cheese was good also. Wish it was a little hotter but the taste was cheesy and delicious."}
{"text":"First time in. Nice place. The employees were super nice. Very helpful. I ordered the Mediterranean, a Big on multi grain. It was good. Nothing to write home about. This place really is just a little more upscale than Subway or Quiznos. So, good for a sandwich but with SO many amazing places to eat in a metropolis like Phoenix, especially in the small single owned non big corporation type business category. Why settle for just \"good\"? So overall, not for me. Really low probability that I'll ever be back as I never frequent the other two similar sandwich shops either."}
{"text":"There are only two reasons that I go to the Potbelly Sandwich Shop on McDowell. First, it's close enough to my office to give me a brisk walk at lunchtime. Second, it's to order a tuna sandwich. Let me explain. I have never ever been a fan of something called a tuna melt - melted cheese over warm tunafish. Who does that? But - at Potbelly, they toast the bread (wholegrain) and put the tuna on to heat it up. I order without the cheese and then, beg for a heaping amount of their proprietary hot pepper giardiniera! It's amazing. Bon Appetit magazine called it the most underrated condiment of all time. They are right. And, they sell it by the jar!!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was good only because the manager was so nice and accommodating.
We ordered take out for 2 adults and 3 kids.
We've never been to a Potbelly before so the ordering process and menu was new to us.
We ordered 3 sandwiches, 2 Mac n cheese sides and a shake.
The sandwiches we ok, nothing particularly special.
We had the Mediterranean with onions, tomato and lettuce , I think I should have ordered more toppings to make the ratio of bread to filling a little better.
The big Italian with lettuce, tomato and onion was ok but had a piece of plastic wrap inside he sandiwch :( luckily it was spotted before the last bites were eaten 
A ham and bacon sandwich, my son liked it, but how can you NOT like bacon
One Mac and cheese came out when it was time to pay but the milkshake and the other Mac was missing....I think the ordering process for non-sandwich items can use improvement."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey wIth bacon on regular bread. I can't eat the whole thing, it's got great flavor. I would back and try the chicken salad. The salads look really good, so that's an option for another day. Vanilla shake was good too."}
{"text":"I like potbellys food and have always enjoyed it but please tell me why is there the need to have live entertainment at lunch time. The location is already noisy and then you put a live singer on top of it and you can't hear anything. I feel bad for the workers because I left there with a headache and I didn't even stay to eat. If I wanted music entertainment I would go to a club at night not at potbellys on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this lunch spot. Excellent customer service and always delicious food! The milkshakes are to die for. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Nicely done sandwiches.  Quizno's replacement.  Stay away from the dream bar (unless you like nightmares)."}
{"text":"This is such a great sub place I just got a sub from there and it was delicious and the delivery girl Alisha was super nice"}
{"text":"Great to have one in charlotte, I've eaten at these all over the east coast and it's worth checking out if you're uptown.  Great service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh ingredients, toasted bread that was delish.  Shakes were good.  The salads were really fresh...but seemed a little boring especially compared to the great sandwiches.  The desserts looked really good but we didn't get anything besides the shakes.  My teen nephews were still hungry after their sandwiches and they don't offer different sizes, but it was perfect size for me."}
{"text":"We had tickets to the Mercury game and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this amazing little sandwich shop!
We both had chubby sandwiches with ranch bacon and turkey. I also ordered an Oreo Shake. 
Prepare to be wowed. I don't know what it is about this sandwich, but it is an experience to eat it. Plenty of sauces mixed with the freshness of the meat and soft toasted whole grain bread....well it's just indescribable and also very affordable!
You need to visit soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant with a good menu. Nothing terribly clever but that isnt a bad thing. Ham and Swiss was good.

Best part of the experience is the customer service. Real good people running the place who genuinely care about their customers experience."}
{"text":"Potbelly started sprouting up in the Land of Lincoln of few years back. My sons coined the phrase Emptybelly since they thought the sandwiches were \"little girly men\" and not quite up to snuff in the size department.

So I decided to check this place out along with fellow Yelper Georgie M. We had a late lunch since we didn't want to compete with the crowds. I must say, nothing has really changed except for the addition of the pizza sandwich. I decided to go with the Wreck. The Wreck can be described as a jack of all trades because it has just about anything you can think of stuffed into the sandwich. Let's see, you get Salami, Angus Beef, Turkey, Ham and Swiss Cheese along with the condiments of your choice. I added mustard and some hot Giardiniera to spice it up. I also got my sandwich skinnied out (thanks to Kelly R for that tip). That's when they scoop out the extra bread and make the bread look like a boat instead of a bed. I must say that the sandwich was delicious, albeit on the puny side.

They have a nice dinning area and glorious outdoor seating on a perfect 82 degree day. So bring your empty belly to Potbelly and filler-up."}
{"text":"Its a chain but they have a wonderful Italian and their little desert treats are amazing. They have something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Just get The Wreck. I had their holiday turkey sandwich and it was meh.

The Potbelly Sandwich is Mr. Sub on steriods for a good cause."}
{"text":"My 1st time to this new location. I'm a big fan of the Chicago locations, especially at Midway. 
I tried their newer chicken cheddar w/ bacon and didn't care for it. The chicken tastes processed. I have a turkey to take home and try though! 
I'll come back for the quick service and to give them a second shot."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, excellent service.  Delicious pickles.  Reminds me of Toaster Oven in San Francisco.  I normally get the wreck.  Get there before 11:30 to beat the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"I don't typically review chains because, well, they're chains. I'm making an exception for Potbelly because I actually dig their food and because something needs to be done about their service model. I still remember the first experience I had with Potbelly, it was 2008, Dallas, TX. We were house hunting at the time and our realtor took us here for lunch. I had a Wreck on wheat. Warm, crispy, mayonnaise-y goodness. Not bad for a chain, really.

Fast forward a few years. 2013, Independence. A relatively new addition to the massive agglomeration of chains and lunch joints designed to service the working masses in that particular business corridor. It had been several years since I'd been to a Potbelly and my wife had a craving. We got there around 1:30pm on a Thursday. Pretty empty having missed the lunch rush. Now that I'm sort of trying to be healthy I opted for what is probably the healthiest thing on their menu, the Farmhouse salad sans bacon and blue cheese dressed with Potbelly vinaigrette. My wife splurged a bit and went historic with the small Wreck on wheat.

First, let's hit the food. The salad actually wasn't bad. I knew what to expect when it came to the meat (frozen, sort of artificial texture, a bit rubbery) so I wasn't disappointed. The veg was fresh, crisp and flavorful and the dressing, although a bit sweet, was pretty good as well. Not a bad lunch. I took a bite of my wife's Wreck and it was just as I had remembered. The big pickle she got was also a nice addition. Now on to the bad. The service...ugh.

For whatever reason, the service here was insanely frenetic and discombobulated. We moved down the line to the order-taker. She smiled and proceeded to take our order. First annoyance. She shouts our orders to the rest of the restaurant while we're still speaking. How about waiting until we're done ordering? No more problems, right? Wrong. After she took our order she told us to head down to the register. Now the confusion. The person at the register asked us again what we ordered. Apparently there's no communication between the order-taker and the money-taker. After we informed said money taker of our selections the order-maker shouted over the top of the counter, \"What did you order again?\" C'mon people. Let's get it together. The floor of the NYSE is more organized.

If you've never been to a Potbelly, there are a few things you should expect:

-It's pretty loud so you'll probably find yourself repeating your order at least three times and asking the same of the people behind the counter.

-There's a pretty tall section of the counter, between where you order and where you pick it up, so if you're under 5' 6\" you probably won't be able to see over it.

-The sandwiches come in three sizes, Original, Bigs (extra meat and cheese) and Skinny (less meat, cheese and bread). The selections available in skinny are limited so do your homework before you go. The people behind you will be happier.

Like I said, I actually think the product that Potbelly produces is pretty good. Sure, it's relatively unhealthy (just about everything is crammed with ungodly amounts of sodium and sugar) but what chain restaurant isn't. For an occasional cheat meal it's tasty enough. I just don't get the logic behind having 6 workers (two of which just stood, leaning against the back wall watching) in a space the size of a closet with no clearly defined roles and limited communication. Maybe it was just the post-lunch atmosphere. Whatever, it was disjointed and awkward."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich, but service was too slow. While several hot sandwiches got cold out of the toaster, the two guys putting on toppings seemed dazed and confused, meanwhile the lady putting sandwiches in the toaster just stood there. Took a solid 20 min to get my sandwich with only about 5 ppl in front of me. Poor service didn't acknowledge the problem when I complained and did nothing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Somewhat new location of he chain in CLT
Freshly made, warmed sandwiches, soup, salads, with the twist of milkshakes. 
A little cramped inside; better to get it to go and eat in Romare Bearden park about a block away."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious compared to Subway. Higher quality food and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Check out the Wreck...these sandwiches are yummy delicious!!  Also, the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are fantastic.  The staff is friendly and genuinely seem to love their jobs.  Sometimes they have live acoustic guy-and-a-guuitar music, which is cool.  A new one just opened in the mall. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Wasn't that bad of a place. Ordered the roast beef on white, with hot peppers, provolone, and light mayo. Sandwich was pretty good, their bread is much better then other competitors. There is not that much meat in the sandwich, however they do not over do it the bread like the other place's do. 
I also had the oatmeal and chocolate chip cookie. My favorite combination!"}
{"text":"Sadly it's just not the same as the US locations. In the US you can readily order a vegetarian sub which consists of cheese (3 different varieties) and mushrooms and your choice of standard toppings. Despite contacting customer service and being assured that this is an option in Canada as well, none of the locations seem to know about it or offer it as an option.

Unfortunately the only veggie option seems to be the Mediterranean which honestly is subpar. 

Customer service has said it's an \"underground menu\" item and that the locations should be aware of it. However when I ask I'm always met with a deer in the headlights type reaction. 

The bread and quality of toppings is great but unfortunately the menu just doesn't match up to that of the US locations."}
{"text":"40 years in business you would think you would have excellent customer service.  
 
Oh well... maybe another location will be willing to take my business...

I explained to them when I first got here that this was my first time here , you would think this would give them the heads up to be willing to explain how the process or order the food and you can choose what bread.   avoid this location and the GM Powell
Worst customer service I have come across

Hey I'm sure Laura fisher his boss is okay with how he treats the customers."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this location to open for awhile to give it a try, including stopping several times before they were open thinking they were.

It seems like I got a bit ahead of myself on how good this might actually be. This isn't the super sandwich shop I was hoping for. It's more the Quiznos to Jimmy John's Subway. The comparison between JJ's and Potbelly is accurate as I feel they both want to present themselves as a more gourmet option to the Subway's and Silver Mines of the world, but really a just a new option on about the same level.

I had the italian sandwich here and while the meats are pretty tasty I didn't think there was much on their and it seemed greasy. The greasy feel was compounded by the fact that when I passed on mayo and mustard and opted for oil I got a sub drenched in it. I think with less oil the flavors of the meats would have come out more. I think the size of the sandwich was rather small as it was comparable in length to a Subway 6\" just wider and more bread. I do have to say the bread was quite good.

I am willing to go back and give potbelly a second chance as the price was reasonable enough that it is worth another shot. Maybe something else will be a more favorable sub."}
{"text":"I love this Potbelly's, I always get fresh sandwiches and cookies. In fact, I think I like Potbelly's cookies better than Subway's. the staff is generally nice, although sometimes there's a line to be served."}
{"text":"With a name like \"Potbelly\" sandwich shops, I was expecting to get a \"Belly-buster\" like sub. Sadly, the subs here are TINY! I got the \"big\" sub, which is still only 9 inches, and seeing how small it was, I ordered extra meat. Still not satisfied, I got a side chilli too. For a whopping $16 lunch, I should have been tapping on my belly rather than still being hungry. Yeah, maybe drink one of their ice-cream shakes everyday and you'll get a potbelly, but eating their subs, you'll just get skinnier and poorer... 

Now on to the food... Their subs is essentially the same as a Quiznos sub. Oh, and I got misled with the sign that said \"hand-sliced roast beef\" thinking it was freshly sliced pot-roast style roast beef that you get at a place like Pumpernickel. It's just the same old processed deli-style roast beef! Why emphasize that it's hand sliced? What, opposed to it being sliced with your foot? Or with an axe?

The chilli was very watery and bland. Even Tim Hortons chilli is better than this place, and I wouldn't consider Tims chilli to be all that good. 

I don't want to criticize the employees too much as I realize the place just opened. But if I'm the only person in line and there is only one sub coming out of the oven, do you really need to ask me what I'm having? Geez, maybe take a wild guess that maybe that one sub is for me? And I have to repeat myself again when I get to the cash, since I have to deal with 3 separate people. Quite inefficient... 

Overall, the food taste wasn't bad. But for a real shaved roast beef sandwich, I would much prefer Pumpernickels. And if I want the cheap deli roast beef, I could get a proper 12 inch at Subway instead for the same price (or cheaper). 

Really lovely restaurant with a nice covered outdoor patio area. But food quality and the miniscule portion sizes just doesn't justify the price..."}
{"text":"I love all of there sandwiches. I just wished they had the potato soup everyday. Its also my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Potbelly when I lived in Ohio. Nice to see it down here in Charlotte. I like the \"less bread\" option for sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was hoping for this place to have panini's but hot sandwiches weren't too far from that.  I got the Mediterranean sandwich with chicken.  Their chicken is wack....it's slime chicken the cheap stuff so not impressed there.  The toppings weren't there either it was a little weak and so it was better then subway but there are better spots like cheba hut and jersey mikes and even firehouse subs probably. If it was cheaper I wouldn't have had as high expectation and rated it better"}
{"text":"Not since the famed White House Sub in Atlantic City have I experienced a sub as delicious.
The giardiniera is unbelievably good too.

Try this:
Get the Italian with giardiniera for take out.
Crack a bottle of chianti.
Slice up some Auricchio imported provolone cheese.
Get a handful of Greek and Italian salad olives.

Now, walk out onto the ledge of a Brooklyn skyscraper under construction in your bib overalls, lunch pale and about twenty other guys and enjoy what used to be one of the best lunches money can buy on this planet.

PS.
If you don't have access to a skyscraper under construction, just sit in your underpants with a beater t-shirt and marvel at how lucky you are to be an American.

{"text":"On opening day, I anticipated a long wait. When I arrived in the late evening, the crowd was slim but the wait was still rather long; nearly 30 minutes in line waiting to order, waiting for the staff to cook food since they already ran out and sandwich assembly.

Having said that, I was very impressed with the staff. Several of them were very apologetic about the long wait. Even the manager approached me THREE times to apologize and thank me profusely for being so patient. One of the staff members gave me a free cookie and the manager threw in a free shake. I never expected one freebie, let alone two. I couldn't even eat it all! Nonetheless, I appreciated the gestures, especially on opening day when they had worked so hard to accommodate large crowds and the staff maintained a pleasant demeanor.

Oh, and yes, the food... the Pizza Sandwich was far more flavorful (and spicy) than I expected. I'll be back to sample other menu items and more of that friendly Potbelly service! :)"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick lunch. Had A Wreck sandwich, it was really good. The employees are very friendly and helpful.
I will come back, next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"just another sandwich shop. was clean inside and the staff was friendly but nothing that really sets this place apart from the other thousands of sandwich shops around. Also was a little disappointed in the sandwich size. Roughly the size of a 6\" from subway but is $5? you'll have to spend a lot of money to get a potbelly from this place."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good here and the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are the best!  The frozen lemonade is disgusting, it's dairy based, WTH?  I left it on the table. Too nasty!  Otherwise for fast food deli this place is A OK!"}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, hot food. After eating here, I don't want to go to subway anymore. The food taste good. Their fresh baked cookies are big and delicious. I go here once or twice a week. The manager is nice and helpful. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I've always gotten good food here. The bread, the filling, and the toppings are all top notch. The service is good too. Sure, it costs more than Subway, but it also tastes a hell of a lot better. The tuna salad is great here, which is something I would be afraid to try at aforementioned Subway."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new sandwich shop in the area and figured PotBelly was a great choice; boy, was I wrong. The staff was completely unorganized when I was ordering so the whole \"welcoming factor\" was out the door. I had to repeat our sandwiches 3 times and my medium soup twice. The vegetable selection is slim and they have one seasoning: Italian. Now on to the sandwich(es).. gross. The turkey was a darker brown color and the roast beef was almost white, both disgusting. I ate 3 bites. The one star is for the bread. Try Madeline's next door, or which which around the corner."}
{"text":"I arrived the day before from the uk to attend a conference and was looking for a place to grab lunch and stumbled upon this gem of a sandwich shop

Inside or outside seating available, free wifi and friendly staff and a super tasty sandwich that hit the spot

They have a good selection of sandwich combos on the board and then you have the option of putting extras on like, Mayo, mustard, lettuce, pickles etc.

I had never been here before and was a little jet lagged but the lovely staff member taking the order went thru the process with me and talked me thru a few of the options.

Simply loved having such brilliant customer service

{"text":"Pot Belly is a nice change up when you are tired of Subway for your sandwich options. The sandwiches are a tad pricier for the amount of sandwich you get, it seems like they have a slightly smaller selection of sandwiches and toppings, but all of the sandwiches I've had taste good. But they do have some fun things you can't get at a Subway, like smoothies. Last time my fiance and I went there, they even had a guitar player for ambiance."}

Had the meatball sandwich and the chocolate brownie cookie. Lots of flavor and very fresh. Nice hot sandwich. The cookie is nothing too special. Tasted a little stale. But you come here for the sandwiches. 
Quick service. The location is right in the heart of downtown. Come here before going to the game!"}

{"text":"Tasty sandwiches, and very cute for a corporate place.  Great for vegetarians!  

For a sub shop, they have a great vegetarian sandwich - this isn't just a cheese sandwich with extra pickles.  Humus, artichoke, feta - delish!  The sandwiches are heated, and you can add mushrooms, as well.  It comes out delicious.

Also try the pizza sandwich with no meat - throw in some mushrooms and hot peppers and you won't be sorry!    

They also have cookies for your sweet tooth and calories listings right on the sign, in case you want to know how much you're eating."}
{"text":"Nice hot sandwiches in a super cute shop with nice fixins and smaller, reasonably priced portions. 

The ingredients are a little more interesting than average.  Their vegetarian sandwich has humus, feta and artichoke, instead of the usual veg offering: just multiple deli cheeses.  They offer mushrooms as a topping (always delicious) and heating the sandwich really does give it a little something extra.  Their pizza sauce is tasty (and the pizza sandwich makes a nice veggie alternative if you replace the meat with mushrooms and sliced tomatoes).

They have lots of great options like thin-sliced rolls (they'll take out some of the middle for you), and they list the calories next to everything, including the desserts.  The food isn't huge, and is priced accordingly.  My husband and I are big fans of that set-up.  We wish this shop were closer to home!"}
{"text":"From Chicago so was pretty thrilled that a potbelly opened up! The food is always really good - my favorite is the Mediterranean sandwich with chicken. The toppings are always very fresh and generous. I've been to this location three times now and the thing they could improve on is time. Some staff seem a little confused and flustered as they prep - perhaps some more training or experience will clear that up. 
Regardless, sandwiches are super yum! Worth a quick stop for lunch :)!"}
{"text":"First let me say I liked Potbelly and have ordered several times but on Wednesday my wife stopped to purchase takeout meals with mine being a tuna sandwich. After eating it I began to feel not well and continued to feel worse until about three hours later I violently heaved all of meal. I was sick for the next two days. I don't know if it was bad tuna or bad mayonaise and hope no one else got sick. I hope the manager checks into it so that they don't repeat. I am afraid now to buy from them agian. 

I have determined that my sandwich was not the cause of my food poisoning but instead bad lettuce I ate at home and wish to apologize to Potbelly for thinking they were the cause of my sickness. I ate the same salad two days later and got sick again and thus determined that was the cause of my sickness."}

Have I mentioned I LOVE POTBELLY!?!?

I LOVE POTBELLY!!!!

I have eaten at other locations in IL for years and years! 

I love the chicken salad!! I love the giardinera!! I love the OCC's!! Chocolate banana shakes are amazing!!

A Wreck is another delicious sandwich. I love that the sandwiches are toasted, but never burnt.

Another plus is you can have them scoop out 1/3 of the bread for those trying to cut carbs but realistically cannot live without sandwiches!
I like the Italian bread and the wheat, but I like the Italian bread more.

Good for older kids, not so much for small children.


Free wifi too :)

I will be a frequent visitor for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Yay!!! Another Potbelly location!
Even though this is in a brand new space, the decor is old fashioned and heart warming. Phoenix Nostalgia and more frames the walls on old fashioned fabulous wallpaper. There are several brown tables inside, with a few unique tables as well, how fun!

I've eaten at approximately 10 other Potbelly  locations in the past 15 years. I still haven't strayed from my favorite chicken salad even once. I've never been disappointed, and this location tastes just as amazing as every other time. I order my sandwich  thin cut with Swiss instead of provolone, lettuce, tomato, Italian seasoning, and most important, HOT PEPPERS, aka \"Giardinera\".

The staff is very friendly, the shelves and cooler were well stocked, and the prices are still reasonable!

I also had a delicious Oreo shake, complete with mini butter cookies. I look forward to returning to get my chicken salad fix."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today got the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich and it was pretty awesome ! Nice clean store with a friendly staff. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Helpful staff. Really good food actually.  First time here.  I like it.   Better than Quiznos or subway."}
{"text":"Midwest gem finally comes to Arizona!

You can't go wrong with anything in their menu, but you have to try the hot peppers on the side.  They are fresh made and delicious as hell!  Plus you can buy a big jar of it if ya want.  I've tried a few different soups and they are all fresh, hot and delicious.  The broccoli and cheese is among the best I've tried.

I am addicted to THE WRECK, so good.  Meat is generous portions, fresh, and seasoned well.  Get bacon.  Extra bacon if you can.  It's really good here.  The Italian is also near perfection.  Load up on veggies here!.. Nice and fresh and tasty!

Nice ambience, plenty of seating options (tall tables, inside/outside, etc), and good customer service.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots.

TIP Get there at 1130 or earlier to beat the weekday lunch rush.  BACON!!!!!  MORE BACON!!!!!"}
{"text":"Go eat here. It's better priced than other sandwich shops cookies and bars are freshly just like homemade and melt in your mouth.

Next time will try their sandwiches instead of just dessert."}
{"text":"Damn good Sammie in my opinion. Wa trying to get to  Ike's on mill but traffic was a nightmare. Forgot about this little guy and glad I popped in. Had the skinny turkey BLT and it was bomb. Omg the voodoo chips are amazing. Almost as good as cool ranch ritos. About to try this lemon cheesecake cookie too. As far as chain sandwiches go, this is up there with anyone. Great service too. Thx.l for lunch."}
{"text":"The 4th point is two things, it was super clean, and the friendly staff person who came up to volunteer their wifi password. That's pretty impressive in a fast food spot.
Big serving of sandwich (had a multi grain ham and swis) options for toppings are standard tomato, lettuce, pickles, mayo mustard etc. Very tasty tomato basil soup, with oyster crackers. Did not try a beverage but you can grab a beer. they also had live music on a tuesday afternoon"}
{"text":"Haven't had a sandwich at this specific Potbellies, but in general I'm a big fan of them.  This review is more about the hot pepper buying experience at Potbellies.  

On a recent trip to Madison from San Francisco, a fellow ex-midwest friend asked me to bring him back some Potbellies peppers.  He told me that you could buy them from the store and asked for the largest jar I could get.  So walking into the store and saw jars of peppers for about $7, which is what I think my friend was asking for.  

But... then I saw these big plastic jugs of peppers sitting high on the shelves, so I asked if those were for sale too.  They are.  So I walked out with a gallon jug of peppers for about $20.  

So to my ex-midwest friend.  You have a gallon of Potbellies peppers coming your way."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and the atmosphere! All meat is fresh /!: taste great. The mixed berry shake is excellent. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"What pleasant surprise.  A good sandwich shop that delivers downtown.  Had a big Italian, good sandwich!  Would prefer ham to mortadella, they'll switch it for you."}
{"text":"Usually a good stop for a sandwich, BUT NOT THIS LOCATION!!!  Had to explain to the bozo making the sandwich the difference between ham and mortadella?  
Why?  
Conversation sort of like this:
\"I'll have a Big Italian on white, extra meat, and please substitute ham for the mortadella, OK?\"
\"OK\"
Clerk proceeds to put extra mortadella on the sandwich.
\"That's mortadella, not ham\"
\"This is ham\"
\"No, that's Mortadella, see the chunks of fat?\"
\"Well OK, but the sandwich already has ham, and I really don't know the difference\"
\"The 'ham' is capicola, I'd like the baked ham instead of the mortadella.  And, don't forget, that's extra meat.\"
\"OK\" 
\"That sandwich still has the mortadella on it, with the ham, I don't want mortadella, and it's supposed to be extra meat.\"
\"Ok\"
Takes off the 1 1/2 slices of mortadella, finally. 
I finally get close to the sandwich I want with Lettuce, tomato and onion.  but no extra meat.
Oh, and this location doesn't have macaroni or potato salad."}
{"text":"I used to hate sandwiches.  I don't know what happened, but I don't anymore.  I'm even starting to experiment with deli meat, which is something I refused to eat most of my life.  I visited Potbelly, as it is really close to my office.  

First, the space is new, clean, lots of seating.  Staff is very friendly.  

I had the Wreck on multigrain, everything on it except hot peppers.  Their hot pepper mix is made in house, but includes green olives, which I hate (and I'm glad I checked or it would have ruined my sandwich).

I thought the bread was great, the proportion of bread to meat to veg was perfect.  My only other complaint besides olives in the hot peppers is that there are no condiments except mayo and mustard, which is kind of boring. 

All in all, it was a good sandwich and I will be adding it into my lunch rotation.  I absolutely refuse to eat at Subway or Quiznos, so obviously Potbelly is doing something right with their food.

Edited in Oct/17 to say that I am now fully addicted to these sandwiches. My favourite is turkey and Swiss on multigrain with extra mayo, extra pickles and all the other fixings (except the olive infected hot peppers)."}
{"text":"Sandwich was good, service was helpful, will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Yum yum!! Great price for great food! The service is very friendly. The sandwiches are appropriate size, not for those with bottomless stomachs. The peppers are AMAZING. Wish I didn't have to drive so far to get them but they are worth the trip. Simple menu makes ordering easy and everything is delicious! Only thing making it miss 5 stars is that there's no x-factor.. Just missing that little extra oomph"}
{"text":"Those hot peppers are...hot...and I like it! In fact, I might have also bought a jar of the hot peppers to take home. What can I say? I like it hot! The sandwiches here are tasty. Every sandwich comes out hot off the grill and they provide the calorie count on the menu next to the item of food. I personally enjoy the chicken and cheddar sandwich and add the hot peppers. If you like chips, make sure you get the Jalapeno or the BBQ Ranch chips. Both are really tasty. I'm happy that Potbellys came to Phoenix. I only wish one was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I'm excited that a little bit of Chicago has come to the Valley! After hearing delicious things about Potbelly, I finally had the chance to visit and I must say, I fully agree with everyone else! Potbelly's is a great sandwich shop and I love my sandwiches. 

Upon walking in, I felt like I had entered a Chicago deli. The friendly employee greeted me and quickly explained how Potbelly's works because she could tell I was a new visitor. I especially like that they list the calories next to each of the sandwiches. I opted for the brand new grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich but left off the cheese. They offered my thinly sliced bread which sounded appealing, so I gave that a try. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that they grill the sandwiches! 

After the sandwich was heated up, I choose my condiments and I added hot peppers. I then picked up some jalapeno chips and bbq ones for my husband and was on my way! The service was friendly and quick and the sandwiches are very reasonably prices at about $5.40 a sandwich. 

It was a long drive home as I drooled while smelling the sandwiches. Finally, I arrived and I practically scarfed my sandwich down. It was amazing! The bread was perfectly cooked and the chicken was good warm. I especially loved the hot peppers which provided a perfect kick to the sandwich. To add to the kick, the jalapeno chips were really good and not \"too\" hot if you typically enjoy a little spice.

They told me that a Potbelly's is about to open on Thunderbird and Scottsdale and one might also open on Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101. I plan on visiting them regularly!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and give this place a try.  They make really good sandwiches.  More importantly, however, the staff is amazing. They are really friendly and willing to have a nice chat while you order and they make your sandwich.  I would probably go back just for the service but the sandwiches are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Yummy toasted sandwiches. Had turkey and chedder on whole wheat. They were out of the broccoli cheddar soup which I was super bummed about. Maybe next time. The great thing is they deliver! I live right in the neighborhood so its nice for a change."}
{"text":"We walk over to the Yonge Sheppard Centre on the occasional  weekend and most food establishments in the food court are closed so we go to A&W.  However today when we went over instead of going to A&W, we tried the Potbelly Sandwich Shop.  The service was wonderful, friendly staff and the food was prepared quite quickly.  We both ordered the Original Pizza Sandwich at $6.99 each.  It 'supposedly' contained pepperoni, meatball, capicola,  marinara sauce, provolone cheese, mushrooms and Italian seasoning.  I ordered it on regular bread, while my husband ordered Multigrain.  Toppings I had were onion and tomato and his were lettuce, onion and tomato.  Considering the ingredients involved in these sandwiches, they weren't up to expectation.  Pepperoni,  so thinly sliced you could hardly taste it.  Meatball? No wonder on the menu it states Meatball without the 's' as we didn't taste a meatball at all.  Marinara sauce, maybe a tablespoon.  Provolone cheese,  I love provolone cheese for it's aroma, but my taste buds didn't even recognize any cheese at all.  Mushrooms, chopped into little tiny bits.  I liked that the sandwich was cut in half, as I only finished one half.  At dinner time, I opened up the left over half, added shredded provolone cheese, few slices of tomatoes, chopped onion, thick slices of pepperoni and some pizza sauce. Heated it up, and that is what a Potbelly Sandwich should taste like!"}
{"text":"Potbelly is a chain.  They just opened.  Maybe our experience was due to the start-up growing pains, but all four in our party were quite disturbed and on the verge of walking out.  Not because of the food, which was average/ok, but because of the  attitude of one worker and the shift manager at the time of our visit.  Maybe this Franchise/chain was short on help, but this \"manager\" clearly was not trained in proper  food service or customer care.  Instead, this person behaved like they did not want to be there and made sure the cloud over their head would spread to everyone else.  This person was rude and treated us like we were such a hassle since it was our first time and we asked a few questions (Eeep!).  When there was a mistake on the order, the shift manager thought it was unreasonable that my buddy ask for a refund on the couple bucks difference and had the attitude like we were nickle-and-diming scum.  With so many terrific food options nearby, this particular Potbelly store will do without four repeat customers.  Bye.   :("}
{"text":"I love this place ! So many  fresh options that ate not going to add pounds!! Lol
Not that I am worried about it, but the midday meal should not weigh us down. 
I recommend the uptown salad! So full of flavor and large chunky fruits and nuts. Very filling. I even ordered one to go!!!"}
{"text":"I love Potbelly but this is the worst location. They can't seem to do anything right here. Their chicken and cheddar has so little chicken it's almost not a chicken sandwich. Their cookies are undercooked and doughy. I came to this location four times in a two week period and it is consistently bad."}
{"text":"Love this place. So much easier to drive to this location ... Instead of lugging my husband's sandwich from Chicago Midway."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is it a great location, but the food and service is great as well. I have personally tried their Mediterranean and it is delicious. They give you the perfect quantity for the meat and other ingredients in the salad. They definitely don't skimp you on anything! My boyfriend has had the Italian a couple different times and he said it gets better and better every time! I can't wait to come to Potbelly more often and try a lot more of their items on their menu. Come and try this place out, you will not regret it! 

It also has a drive thru so if you are not wanting to get out of the car it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I took a drive during the lunch hour specifically to visit Potbelly Sandwich Shop in Phoenix.  Having once enjoyed Potbelly in Columbus, Ohio, I was looking forward to once again tasting a memorable sandwich.  While my friends got sandwiches, salads, and milkshakes, I enjoyed an Original Italian and added a BIG PICKLE (yum!!!).  It was so big, I shared it with both my friends.  Those working there were very attentive and the food was ready in a very timely manner.  The food itself was tasty and lived up to the wait that I had since I had last enjoyed Potbelly about three years ago.  

The only challenge that I experienced was the parking, which was one outside parking lot shared by several restaurants and stores.  I made the mistake of driving during the noon hour, so I had plenty of competition for a small number of spaces.  There is valet parking available, but there was a short line that barely moved.  We got lucky and saw a car leaving from the lot and followed it to take its spot when leaving.  Other than parking, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Italian sandwich is toasted and even then the bread was pretty soft which I liked. I think they skimp a bit on the meat compared to Jersey Mike's. They skimp even more on the lettuce and I couldn't even find the onions. A tasty sandwich that could be much better. Vanilla shake was very good. Pretty slow line considering it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"Love it!

Went in for lunch one day a day and was really impressed. The food was great, the place has a great atmosphere (with live music!) The staff were super friendly and the owner even came by to ask how everyone's food was. I got another sandwich  (chicken and cheddar) which was equally amazing. It's on the pricier side for a sandwich but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because of all the hype and how close it is to the Biltmore, but it just didn't do much for me. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the lady at the register said that was her favorite item. I figured - you can't really go wrong with a chicken salad sandwich, plus her excitement... why not? It was terrible. Lacked flavor. Incredibly dry. I felt like it was canned chicken salad with not much else. I also ordered the chili with cheese and onions.. also, lack of flavor and had a bad aftertaste. The service is amazing - very friendly people, and the layout is nice as well. However, the food is lackluster and it'll end up being an overrated deli."}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened a Potbellies in Gilbert. 
I am from Chicago and I been going to the original one since I was a kid! 
Love the Italian sub, check them out !"}
{"text":"I would have to say this is one of my favorite places to eat lunch. The sandwiches are awesome and the staff is great. The atmosphere in here is very inviting and the live music (once a week) really makes for a relaxing dining experience."}
{"text":"This place deserves the one star rating due to the attitudes of the manager and the staff.  I was dining on Friday around 6 PM when a group of college girls placed their orders.  
The manager saw that one of the girls had ordered water but was preparing soda.  He immediately confronted her and 'you are paying for the f**king soda\".   Can you believe any one would confront a guest with this?
Business lost from me."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The customer service is top notch. They even had live music. Being a Thursday afternoon, I really didn't expect that. The sandwiches are good. Nothing that blows me away but not bad either. If you tired of subway or any other big chain sub shop, try these guys out."}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are pretty decent, the staff was nice. There was a pretty long wait for my food but it was kinda busy. only complaint is I was given a strawberry shake instead of a smoothie, and MAN did I really want a strawberry smoothie today."}
{"text":"The sign says \"ORDER YOUR SHAKE NOW!\" and let me tell you, I appreciate it. I know where the good milkshakes are and few restaurants invest the time into making a shake with real ice cream. Most places that offer shakes have a machine with a corn syrup mix in it. While I think it's  dumb to have the cashier making the shakes, I love the place. Half the time, I don't get a shake just because it's unhealthy but the rest of the menu supports enough variety. Quizno's left the Cleveland area a few years ago and I like Potbelly better. A good meatball sub is hard to find as is the Mushroom Melt a unique find. The salads are loaded too. They will also sell you a box of the small cookies they use on the straws too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there today for the first time, they were in theory closed but the door were opened so we just walked in, they were really nice, the food was delicious! We are definitely coming back! The loaded baked potato soup is so good! So creamy! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am wondering if we even went to the same place??! I have been here 2 times, each time was amazing. There are a lot of people working there yes, but I assume since they just opened they are training as many people as they can before ASU opens. The sandwiches are priced amazing $5 for a toasted sub. The bread is a chibaata hybrid that is chewy yet soft. The milkshakes are some of the best shakes I have ever had, hand scooped and the little cookies they put on top are a perfect combination. Speaking of cookies, the oatmeal chip cookies are soooo good! Come here for good sandwiches, amazeaballs shakes, and freshly baked cookies. You can't beat the prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. Great place, friendly staff. Clean dining area. Will definitely return. Must try the Wreck!"}
{"text":"First time their    I so Loved the Food  I had the Wreck   amazing.  My husband had the wreck but they added 60 cents   for vegetarian that he didnt have  he got the full Wreck .  His was amazing also..  I asked for a smoothie and got a thick shake .. :(    My Main Problem was that this place was so unclean  at the time we were the only ones in their  and we went to three table before we found one that was sorta clean    as i sat their i looked around  all i saw was un clean tables  the floor was  so dirty  and chairs had food on the seats  and food on floor and chairs   ..  Sad  It wasn't like they were  so busy they didnt have time   NOT BUSY ..  Please  check your tables and clean  and sweep floors .. Will i be back  I sure will  I loved the  sandwiches  they were the best Ive ever had  so so Good ..  But hope the Mangers see this and  Make sure the Crew  do alot better of cleaning the tables, chairs, and Floors .    Thank You"}
{"text":"Picked up a \"Bigs\" Grilled Chicken & Cheddar sandwich ($6.10).  The line was about four people out the door when I arrived just before noon.  Things moved along efficiently, though, with the aid of a person handing out menus on the street and another person taking down orders mid-line via an iPad.  The time from getting in line until walking out the door with my sandwich was a shade under 15 minutes.  It is pretty loud inside, and I could barely hear the woman adding toppings to my sandwich above the buzz of the other diners, the behind-the-counter activity, and the occasional shout of \"Chocolate Shake!\" down the line.

The Grilled Chicken & Cheddar sandwich tasted decent, and I particularly liked the bread.  It was a step-up in quality from Subway and maybe a little bit better than Quiznos, though on the downside you can get more meat from a Subway $5 footlong and Quiznos has more variety in its sandwiches.  If you're feeling a bit more spendy ($7 - $10), I would recommend the more creative sandwiches at Cleveland Pickle down the street.  And if you're not wedded to getting a toasted sub, I think Jimmy John's would be the way to go."}
{"text":"Sort of a weird Panera/Subway bodge overall. Food is better than average for chain food. Ordering is assembly line. Grab your drink, order food, tell them what you want on it, and pay. The sandwiches are all under $7 (Tuna, bigs was about $6). It's everything else that digs into the pocket book, from drinks to chips to sides. $2 for a bottled water. $1.10 for a .25 cent bag of chips. Ridiculous. But of course, pricing this way takes away the stigma of fast food combos. 

Had the aforementioned tuna. It was nothing special but good. What the hell is with raw carrot chunks though? That is a texture nightmare and never belongs in tuna salad!  Wrecks were light on meat, in my opinion. Hot peppers would be better labeled as sweet peppers.

Staff was friendly for the most part and the dining area very clean. Kind of has to be considering how many food joints there are in this plaza (6?)."}
{"text":"Great food and service! A must try sandwich shop. We will be back. The chicken & cheddar sandwich was excellent. My wife had the turkey breast both were very tasty. Don't forget to add the peppers"}
{"text":"I would actually go with a 3.5 on this one... leading to a 4 star.  My friend was way excited to see this chain pop up in the valley, so we added it to the pre-class dinner rotation and I have to say there are a few things I really like.

The staff has always been super nice. I'm a little confused about some of the negative ordering comments. Maybe if you called something in for pick up there could be an issue, but you are standing right there (subwayesque), so if it's not to your liking, say something.

From what I have been told, the menu is not \"full\" yet. They do offer a big version and a skinny version which we were told should be coming early 2013.

I personally like the wreck. It's a pretty perfect sandwich. And I love that they clearly post the calories. Having spent most of 2012 significantly reducing my body size, I want to know what I'm putting in it and that's not always easy to do when dining out.

The space is clean and open. The menu selection offers a little bit of everything. And I agree with Kate O, the dream bar is pretty much just that."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had the Mediterranean Flat with chicken. Absolutely wonderful! Affordable prices. Staff was very patient as was our first time here. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I recently had a Potbelly sandwich on a diverted flight layover in Baltimore and it was delicious! So I've been dying to to try the one here. (Was it THAT good or was I just hungry in Baltimore). 

I did an online order of the same Ham and Swiss sandwich I tried there. I walked into the store and she said \"are you the online order\"? How did she know?!? It was warm and ready and tasted just like the one in Baltimore!! Yay!!

Easy online system. Fast and friendly service. Sandwich in my opinion is better than Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mike's and way better than Subway. Can they please build one in north Peoria?? 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"pulled pork sandwich is dry and no flavor at all. you have to ask for barbecue sauce even though it is described with tangy bbq. it is sweet baby rays sauce, not homemade and service was just okay. very disappointed"}
{"text":"The best gourmet toasted sub around. Always a good choice, always fresh!! And the jumbo cookies are awesome and always fresh baked as well! The staff is always very friendly and helpful. 
Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Visited pot belly for convenience being next to our hotel. I did not like these sandwiches. They had no meat on them and the bread was soggy. Subway is the place to go from now on."}
{"text":"I love A Wreak and get it with everything on it, minus oil.  Can't go wrong with that order and it is just the right amount of spicy with the peppers.  The pressing for adding mushrooms and bacon can get a bit annoying sometimes."}
{"text":"Beats Subway any day. Fresh, toasted sandwiches. Took a star off due to limited options and a bit pricey but overall, it's one of my go-to places for a sandwich and you can't beat the fact that it has a Drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Fast service, fresh. Consistent. Price is reasonable $7.26 for a big sandwich. the server is super nice and friendly.

Environment is clean and spacious and cool.

Next to Starbucks if you desire to go drink some coffee.

Easy parking lot, a lot of parking spaces."}
{"text":"This was my first time at potbelly,and I loved it!! The ordering system kind of reminds me of Quiznos, but the sandwiches are way better. I also ordered a pickle which I thought would be a little spear but turned out to be the biggest pickle ever!! So good! I love that they list the calories in everything. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I had my first Potbelly Sandwich Shop experience at this newly opened location. It was well run and the staff was very friendly. My sandwich was great too, and reasonably priced to boot. I'm looking forward to exploring more of the menu at Potbelly."}
{"text":"Alright you Arizonan's!!  You are in for a treat!  Potbellys is one of the best sandwich places in Chicago and it's arrived here in AZ.  Some things I love about Potbellys that you should know:

-Local musicians rock out their acoustic guitars while you munch on yummy food.
-\"Skinny\" sandwiches skimp on the bread not on the meat.
-Dream bars (enough said)
-Bags of oatmeal cookies are SO SO good!
-Oreo smoothies are really tasty!
-All shakes/malts/smoothies come with little cookies on the straw.
-The decor of this place is cool.  It's very vintage with a local feel as well.  I would never guess it was a Chicago spot if I didn't know it already.

Eat here people and I promise you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now.  Everyone likes something - I eat the Italian, my husband eats the Clubby & my son will eat the Tuna.  Not big but good & fast when no one can agree on anything.  Wish they had Pastrami but oh well.  They have plenty of parking and online ordering which is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Not only is the food delicious every time their customer service can't be beat.  You cannot go wrong with any sandwich choice. I personally can't get enough of their tuna or chicken salad sandwich. For dessert their cookies are dangerously delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich spot from Chicago has arrived! My go-to order is a wreck on wheat, skinny cut, everything minus mayo, extra peppers, extra pickles. Grab the orange mango Nantucket Nectar and a oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. 

If the weather is nice dine out in the plaza across the street. The strawberry banana shake is awesome and I love the little butter cookies that accent the straws. 

Definitely stop in and give them a shot!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is one of the best places to get a good sandwich. Overall great taste and value. 10/10 would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and wonderful food! Try the toasted peanut butter and jelly sub it's like being a kid all over again. The milkshakes are better than homemade!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh made sandwiches and shakes. The husband and i stopped by to see what the rage was all about... and were pleasantly surprised. 

The set up is similar to other sandwich shops, and they toast like at quiznos.... the difference is that their food tastes much more fresh and high quality. We had the roast beef, and it was quite satisfying. The milkshake was amazing. 

Great option for a quick, delicious bite to eat while you're getting your shop on!"}
{"text":"This Potbelly's in Champaign is a great place to go get a decent, quick meal because Potbelly's known for their good sandwiches among other things. This place also serves the most random, but a great variety of drinks to choose from. My friend gets the Stewart grape soda and says it's great. This place has good customer services and their milkshakes are omg orgasmic lol get the Oreo shake. Woohoo Potbelly's!"}
{"text":"The bread on my sandwich was good without being overwhelming.  The ingredients were fresh.  It was just not made the way I asked.  I ordered the Hammie Skinny, and asked for mayo, mustard, lettuce, and tomato.  It came with barely two leaves of lettuce and mayo.  I asked for a pickle on the side, thinking it would be a dill spear.  Nope.  I got a skinny slice of dill placed on top of the sandwich wrap.  

The broccoli cheddar soup was very good -- not too thick and with bits of broccoli throughout instead of one big chunk here and there.

Potbelly's carries a different  brand of bagged chips called Zapp's.  And the restaurant must be famous for its hot pickles as they sell jars of them under their own brand name.  Potbelly's also offers shakes and -- something I love that's hard to find -- malts!  The salads I saw all looked good, so I'm willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious! It's toasted and the the tastes really get to you especially with the meats they use. I guess you can say that it's a little fancier version of other sandwich shops. 

I prefer the Italian or the Wreck (which is like Italian except it has roast beef)

Other items on the menu looks really tasty too!"}
{"text":"So, let me just say something- this was my first time here and these sandwiches have NO MEAT. I ended up adding my own meat and cheese at home to taste something besides the bread. But, the broccoli cheddar soup was great, which was why I rated two stars. If you're wanting a fully loaded sandwich, this isn't the place to be."}
{"text":"Larger than the store on FLW and 101.  Fast and friendly service.  They even had a guy playing guitar at lunch.  My wreck sandwich was as good as usual."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a good experience.  The Wreck sandwich was very tasty and the price with chips and a drink was reasonable.  Others have complained that the sandwiches were too small but I thought the portion was perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I'm not a frequent visitor of Potbelly's but I have become a fan lately.  I'm not usual a sandwich eater which is what has kept me away for many years.  I was in need of a quick and healthy meal so I popped into Potbelly's and was pleasantly surprised by their salad offerings.  They have a few salads to choose from and you can add or subtract any of the sandwich toppings you would like.  I get the one with chick peas and add spicy peppers and feta cheese.  It's a few steps above Subway salads for the price so I can't complain!  The staff is always super friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting.  Pretty sure it's a chain I'm unfamiliar with.  Alright sandwiches nothing spectacular, but decent."}
{"text":"sandwich is ok. substandard ingredients. Lots of turnover of staff and limited in numbers. They beat Jimmy Johns but not Portillos."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in Charlotte that never ceases to amaze.  Can always make it through the line in under 10 mins during the busiest times. 

Stacked menu with flavorful toppings.  Chicken & Chedder, Wreck, Lamb Gyro, Mac & Cheese are my favorites.  Cookies are also amazing. 

The owner Shaq provides over the top service to ensure his customers satisfaction"}
{"text":"I used to work just a ways down the street on 16th St and McDowell and a coworker and I would frequently place pick up orders here. I've tried a few different sandwiches, and they were all good, but my all-time favorite sandwich is their peanut butter & jelly sandwich. I know it's hard to go wrong with a PB&J, but seriously... it is heavenly. The bread is always nice and warm (and toasted) and with the PB&J on warm and toasted bread it just creates this great flavor combination that is to die for. I sadly don't work near them anymore, so I will definitely come down here just for the PB&J!! :)"}
{"text":"I will admit...Potbelly is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me (as far as chain restaurants go, I frequent this place probably more than is healthy). It's personally the best Italian sandwich I've ever had (I can't explain why...it just is), and the service is always quick and on-point. The employees here are so nice! They go out of their way to be friendly and welcoming, and you definitely leave with a smile on your face every time you stop by."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of hype about Potbelly's lately so I decided since it's somewhat close to work, I'd try it out for a late lunch. I walked in thinking it looked pretty nice inside and thought it was helpful they had directions up above for how to order. I decided to order the turkey sandwich but substituted the swiss for provolone. The style of it reminded me a lot of Quiznos, especially with the sandwich going through the oven. I didn't like the fact that I couldn't see what was going in my sandwich (the glass was too high for me to see) but maybe it's because I'm short? Both girls who made my sandwich were really friendly and helpful to the \"newbie\". I decided to get my usual lettuce, tomato, mayo but also to add italian seasonings (salt, pepper, oregano). When I went to pay, the cashier was pretty distracted with another customer so I had a couple minutes to look at the desserts. I decide to get the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, just for good measure. For a combo and the cookie, it was just under $10. Not bad but not great either on price.

I go to sit down and literally every table is taken (and this was around 2:30PM). I didn't realize how few tables they have until I walked to the back of the restaurant. I settled for sitting at the bar against the window in between two strangers (nothing horrible just not preferred). I open my sandwich and was reminded of Quizno's yet again, minus the multi grain bread option I chose with my sandwich. It didn't taste bad by any means just nothing special or unique. The best thing I ate was the cookie, would TOTALLY recommend!! They also had a brownie/cookie looking thing that looked pretty amazing too!

Overall, I liked the way it looked inside, especially with the older pictures of the Phoenix area displayed on the walls. I wish I would have had my own table but it wasn't that big of a deal. I guess I was expecting more but didn't exactly get it. I would honestly eat here again just not making my top list for favorite sandwich places. I'd personally recommend Togo's in Chandler and Casella's in Scottsdale for a unique and delicious sandwich experience."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Their sandwiches are so good! Think of it like Subway/Quiznos style but WAAAAYYYY better! They even have huge pickles and awesome cookies to buy too! Totally will be back to try one of their shakes as I hear those are amazing too."}
{"text":"Great sand which shop!  Excellent food and awesome customer service.  The only thing that is not good is the parking."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, friendly service and right downtown. I was here during Super Bowl and even though they were busy beyond belief, they still managed great food and service with a smile. 

I love that the toast the sandwiches as well!"}
{"text":"Best customer service of my life the manager mad sure I was satisfied even though I ordered my sandwich wrong twice he went above and beyond this was my first time definitely not my last and the food is great"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I already reviewed POTBELLY.. here goes again; it's a NICE option for deli style sandwiches, it's not cheap.  I enjoyed POTBELLY a few times in the states.  Having said that, where is it cheap/affordable to eat nowadays?!  Tough to eat out in Toronto.  Need to be crafty!  I like the turkey w swiss cheese, a good hot pepper (diced) sauce.  Will return."}
{"text":"Best sand which shop hands down! Sooo wish we had these in Cali! Customer service was great and food was delish! For the amount of customers in the store, we received our order fairly quickly, thanks to the assembly line behind the counter!"}
{"text":"First timers! Very fresh. Had the chicken and ceddar w avacado. Hubby had the roast beef. So much better than a subway!! A little too much bread for my taste but it was fresh and i felt the chicken wasnt processed mystery meat! Friendly staff. Clean. Fast. I tried to order a \"big\" so i could take 1/2 to my daughter who lives around the corner but they fixed me an original. When i mentioned it, they apologized but didnt offer to make it right."}
{"text":"It was ok. Definitely better than subway or quiznos. Nothing I would go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"There was a metal nail found in my friends food. They made another sandwich for her and gave 2 free sandwich tickets that had been expired for 2 months prior. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The good: the sandwiches are decent (though pretty much any NYC deli still makes better) and you can customize heavily. Service is quick.

The cons: manager during weekday lunches - a tall, bearded blond guy - yells constantly at an almost incredible volume. Currently in a near-deserted shop and he is still shouting at the top of his lung to communicate with staff. I'm someone who likes going to loud bars but I have no idea why this would be necessary or appealing in anyone's mind."}
{"text":"Just a lunch spot but they are Fast, super friendly and accurate!  Love this shop.  Less than a mile from my office and maybe a new / old go to.... And they have giardiniera! Also they have pretty good soup!"}
{"text":"Food and experience were good. I just have a hard time giving it a higher rating when there are already a ton of good sandwich shops. Nothing really stood out as different or outstanding. No doubt the food and service were good though."}
{"text":"That grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich is THE TRUTH! Soooooo delicious! And the bread is lightly toasted and soft and doughy and perfect. This is my new favorite sandwich shop, so happy we stopped in. Oh! AND THEY HAVE ZAPP'S POTATO CHIPS (for my fellow Louisianaphiles). Everything is sold a la cart (no combo meals), but you won't be disappointed. My guy had the \"A Wreck\" sandwich and he was also fairly pleased with it, which is saying a lot. (He's a very picky sandwich connoisseur). ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I don't even care if Potbelly is a chain.  I'm still going to review it.

The perfect sandwich: The Vegetarian, on wheat, with everything except oil.  Toasted.  

Seriously, people: What's not to love about mushrooms, melted cheese, and hot peppers on a sandwich whose bread is toasted?"}
{"text":"I love, LOVE the vegetarian sandwich without oil on it (there's just nothing sexy about oil dripping all over the place while you're trying to eat a sandwich).  It has everything I like (mushrooms, cheese *and* hot peppers!) rolled up in one hot & crispy sandwich!  

Mmm....love at first taste..."}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan, I was excited to see a Potbelly's open here. I've been twice, both times it was just okay. The soup is pretty great, I wish they had a better menu though. Usually the soup I'm in the mood for isn't available that day of the week. Definitely worth a try, just don't expect the best sandwich ever. You will find a quick and reasonably priced lunch."}
{"text":"Big tuna on wheat. That is all you need to know. Love it!"}
{"text":"Sorry only two stars. While the sandwiches are good, I can't for the life of me figure how they ran out of meatballs after lunch. The \"we made a lot of meatball\" sandwiches doesn't fly. What are they supposed to do the rest of the day?"}
{"text":"We have been going here for some time and its always been great. The staff is so friendly and never misses a beat."}
{"text":"Very good selection and service.  I'm a fan of this restaurant.  The Bread is very good and toasty.  The portion sizes are decent but on the small end.  The prices are very good for the uptown market.  I recommend potbelly for lunch.  The grilled Chicken with Cheddar is very good!  The staff is very friendly and I recommend this location in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you are expecting an AMAZING sandwich...try some place else. Potbelly is just another quiznos-esk sandwich shop. Nothing unique, nothing special - well they do have a PB&J sandwich.

I got the 'A Weck' tasted alright, I liked the warm toasted bread (just like Quiznos and Subway). To be honest for a sub that had 4 difference kinds of meat on it, I was a little disappointed that I tasted more mustard than meat.

Thomas got the Meatball and was kept looking at his sandwich to make sure there was actually meat on it...hardly any marinara sauce, I don't think he tasted a single meatball.

I'm actually surprised at the amount of 5 stars for such a run-of-the-mill sandwich. Good, food, but I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"The best quick and convenient sandwich place I've had! I love their turkey sandwiches with EVERYTHING. Way better than jimmy johns in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain sandwich shop. I had the Italian with hot peppers. I will admit that without the hot peppers it probably would not have gotten as good of a review."}
{"text":"We ordered ahead of time for pick up. It had been years since I've been to a potbellys so I was excited! I ordered a salad and my daughter ordered a soup. 
When I walked in one worker was helping a customer and another was just standing around. I had to wait for the other customer to be done before I was even acknowledged. My food was already paid for and ready to go so all they had to do was hand me a bag ... so I'm not sure why that other worker couldn't have done it. 
Other than that,  the food tasted good and the prices are reasonable. Not sure I'll go out of my way though to make a stop back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  I love their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  Sooo good and I'm a bit of a dessert snob.
The sandwiches are good and filling.  The \"thin\" size is more than enough bread for me.  This place in my opinion is cheaper and better than Jimmy Johns.  The thin sandwich is around 5$.  They serve breakfast on weekdays.  They also offer delivery."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!!  Good soups!  Get a pickle cut in quarters instead of chips...  The Italian on wheat is my favorite...no mayo needed !  All sandwiches can be ordered skinny!  They take out half the core of the bread!"}
{"text":"This shop is awesome! It is always busy since it is so close to ASU but Every time I have gone they always have enough staff working which is great! 
The staff is friendly and they actually look like they enjoy working there. Potbelly's is the only sandwich shop where I actually like my sandwich toasted. They run it thru a quick oven unlike the other sandwich places. They offer smaller portions with less meat or the larger sizes with more meat and cheese. I also love their soup. Broccoli cheddar is awesome! 

What is really cool about this location is that they have old pictures of ASU and Tempe. You can see history while eating your meal. It is cool to see retro photos of the ASU football team and the school."}
{"text":"Oh Potbelly I love your ham and Swiss sandwich! This place is so yummy for my tummy. I always enjoy eating here and I always get the same sandwich. I love it that much. 

Their sandwiches are toasted but not Subway toasted. You get to choose from some groovy toppings. I really enjoy ordering online. It's very easy too and you do not have to create an account."}
{"text":"Here for second time in a month. Out of salad dressing both times, and this time, out of mustard.  How is a sandwich shop out of mustard?   Can I suggest the manager make a run to the grocery store, or is that too outside the box?"}
{"text":"Such a delicious sandwich! My wife and I will be back to try more things. 

We got the Wreck twice, and it was an explosion of flavors. Big upgrade from JimmyJohns. 

Less bread, more toppings. 
About the same price as JimmyJohns,  but a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed but not disappointed. Potbelly's did have the speed on it's side. I had ordered, got my sandwich and shake in less then 10 minutes. 

The sub was good but I felt it was lacking in something. Could just be me. I also ordered the Coffee shake... which tasted like a plain vanilla shake. It was lacking in the coffee flavor. However, the cute little cookies on the straw was a nice touch. Their chip choice is small but they were very good. 

I would go again but it's not a place I'll become a regular at."}
{"text":"I came In for lunch today because I was looking for something new near my work. For being my first time it was a shitty experience at first. As I walked up I got no welcome.. I said I'll take the skinny combo with broccoli cheese and the turkey sandwich on wheat. To which the \"manager\" stated \" regular or multigrain\" .... I said multigrain WHEAT (like I stated before).. As I moved down the line he continued to be very rude with just about everything he said.

When I got to the register (I'm not one to complain as I have always worked in dining/ customer service) I mentioned to the cashier that for being  a new place you guys sure treated customers like shit. Alisha who was the cashier apologized and said she would talk to her other manager about it... She offered a free desert in apology ( I wasn't asking for a handout but was glad she was showing she cared) I told her she didn't need to do that and it wasn't her fault to which she responded \"I know but I want to be a great manager one day and customers shouldn't be treated poorly\" ... To say the least, if she wouldn't have turned around my experience I would have never gone back. My sandwich was awesome and the desert she offered was something I will probably get in the future... For being a new business they should be treating every customer who walks through the door with respect, not shitty attitudes. Anyways, I left pleased thanks to Alisha and I truly hope this is gets addressed...."}
{"text":"This has become my family's favorite sandwich shop in town. The meat, bread and sandwich fixings consistently taste great, and the staff is friendly. I personally love the Skinny Sandwiches, which are 1/3 less meat and cheese than the regular ones. They are perfect for a smaller appetite and you don't feel deprived at all. It also allows me to snag one of their fantastic chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, which I am powerless to resist. (Definitely the best sandwich shop cookie I've ever had!)"}
{"text":"Had the big Mediterranean chicken with the tomato soup. So good! Great, fast service!"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native who moved to Tempe for school they finally opened the first potbellys on 7th and Camelback. I traveled all the way there to get a sandwhich because it was a reminder of home. Then they opened the one downtown and of course I started going there more often because it was closer and thats when I began chit chatting with the assistant manage (who is now the manager of the tempe one) and he remembered my sandwich and how many cookies I got on a regular. And then the Tempe shop opened and it seemed like I was there every day! I adore how the people treat me there and the manager there is always so happy! He does a great job with his customers. My sandwich is always top notch even with the basic toppings and the cookies my goodness if I could marry a food place this would be it!"}
{"text":"Decent price for their sandwiches,A lot quicker than Jimmy John's,Nice to pregnant women and have amazing shakes. The only downside is there portions are a little bit tiny. But great if you want a snack."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick lunch, I've never tried it before and I was looking for some good soup. Turns out they have a perfect sandwich melt and soup combo that was exactly what I was looking for. They ran out of chicken noodle but was happy to accommodate when I asked for a sample of the garden vegetable and of course I loved it. My sandwich was toasted perfectly and better then expected. The two girls who assisted me were very sweet and had great customer service. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"In my book, Potbelly is 5 stars all the way.  I am used to getting Potbelly in the Midwest, complete with that Midwest hospitality.  That was definitely what was lacking when I visited this location in Scottsdale.  I am used to the employees asking \"What ya havin'?\" and getting people through the line so quickly, efficiently and friendly that it is a treat to eat there.  The employees at this location were a little less than enthused to be there and didn't acknowledge me until I was standing there for a few minutes waiting to order.  They also don't have the BIG size sandwiches which was a disappointment because my hubby can eat way more than the normal size Wreck sandwich.  The taste of the sandwich was just as good as I expect, but I needed a little bit more hospitality to reach 5 star normal Potbelly caliber."}
{"text":"The Wreck is the best sandwich I've had at a sandwich place. The Chicken and Cheddar is delicious as well. I would travel the seven seas just to eat here. It's always clean inside, and the staff is super friendly at every one I've been to. Oh how I wish I could try everything on the menu.."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I tried the chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very bland and terribly depressing.  I can't believe it.  I was so excited to try this place, especially after reading some of the reviews about the location on State St.  Wrong sir wrong!!  The interior of this location was pretty darn cool and comfy, and the staff was very friendly, but the sandwich reminded me of something you'd get out of a hospital cafeteria.  Blech.  

Craptacular."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich. To address some of the reviews saying there aren't enough options- you don't need options when they've crafted their sandwich for the specific condiments they serve. Mayo and mustard, can't go wrong with those. I ate my big size sandwich and ordered another one for the road. Double thumbs up from this guy.

Edit- grammar"}
{"text":"One of the newer places downtown... they have great subs and the service is speedy! I recommend the meatball sub, and throw some bacon on that bad boy."}
{"text":"They make good sandwiches. My friendordered a vegetarian sandwich and lo and behold, I liked it, so that says a lot about their ingredients. But, I don't think it's worthy of a lot of return trips. 
 
 Better than Silver Mine Sandwiches, but not as good as the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and efficient. Anytime, I go to a sub shop for the first time, I get their Meatball Sub, as I think it serves as a benchmark for their other subs, though this is not always the case (as happened here).

So, I ordered one here with Provolone Cheese. I loved the toasted roll (less dough than most other places) but, it needs quite a bit of improvement. At first bite, the meatball was very bland. Only, after getting into the sauce with the spices sprinkled on did the taste improve.

For being as crowded as it was (14 people when I walked in + 5 more with take-out)

I have had better elsewhere. But, I'd try their Italian next time around.

Well, I was late in getting the above review posted. So, I'm adding my 2nd visit here.

As stated, I did order the Italian and a Oreo Cookie Milkshake. And, I must say, it was a very good sandwich from end to end.

After reading a rave review on their OC Milkshake, I knew that I'd have to try one. Well, I did. And, it was decent. I really liked the mini oreo's and short bread cookies that they put on the lid (the short bread fits around the straw, and the oreo's sit on top). But, the shake was a bit thin (could easily suck it through a regular straw), and the bits of oreo's were pulverized into grains.

Also, a reviewer said, \"Great sandwich selection\". Unless I missed something, 10 sandwich choices isn't a great selection, imo.

Also on this visit, the shop was quite noisy. Even though there were less people (10 dine in + 3 takeout) than on my first visit.

While I did enjoy the Italian, over all, I think most of the other sub shops are better. So, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing sandwich shop. Was killing time waiting for social security office and found this gem in phoenix. Had the wreck with mushrooms hot peppers mayo and mustard and it was to die for."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad from this place with high expectations- unfortunately I was unimpressed with the salad which was mostly ice berg lettuce. They charge extra to change out lettuce to spinach so I should have done that ! The atmosphere is cool but I wish the salad I ordered (Mediterranean salad) had more chicken"}
{"text":"I usually am a fan of this place,  but sadly not today. I decided to venture away from my normal salad and get a Flat Sandwhich with veggie soup. How,  I wish I wouldn't have.  The food was good,  but not completely what I wanted.  I love hot food. I asked for hot peppers and onions and received none and was given chicken noodle soup instead of veggie. Yes, my order was delivered before the specified time.  15 minutes early to be exact, but I would have rather had it, at the exact time and right.  I'm not giving up on them though.  Their salads are amazing."}
{"text":"This was my first time to ever go to pot belly. The sandwich I ordered was \"a wreck\". The employees there are very nice and made ordering a breeze! The toppings I got were pickles, which are not sliced like they usually  are but sliced long and thin (which I think is better cause now I get some pickle in every bite), mayo, and lettuce. The sandwich tasted great and I'm glad we now have a toasted sandwich shop near the ASU area."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently moved locations and ever since then we have noticed a major decline in the service. Today for instance we went in and there were three people working. Nobody welcomed us or smiled. One of the guys was flying back and forth between making the sandwiches and checking customers out. The other two kids were just filling stuff. I worked food service for quite a few years and the first thing you learn is the customer always comes first. More than half the tables are always dirty. It's like the employees make you feel uncomfortable for coming in. This could be solved with good training by someone who knows how important good service is. I miss the old locations work ethic."}
{"text":"The inside is nice...was lacking meat on the sandwich.. wish I was eating at a subway where they  give give you a good portion . Feel like I got robbed."}
{"text":"First time here! Ordered the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich and decided to add onions and tomatoes to the mix. Tasted great, friendly staff, and good prices! Can't wait to go back and try their \"secret menu\"."}
{"text":"Justin at potbelly is the man. I'm in line and I see customers trying to give him tips and he refuses them. I came to this shop because I'm new here from chicago and potbelly is a Chicago based food shop. Justin will take care of you. Come here for a great lunch snack!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and great prices for downtown Phoenix. Fast and friendly staff also! I had the Turkey Club and it was really good! My wife had a salad and she enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today and was pleased for the most part. The staff was really friendly and fast. The chicken and cheddar sandwich was awesome. You have to add the hot peppers! Yum! The southwest veggie soup wasn't the best, but it was decent. The sandwich made up for it! I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sandwiches! Prices aren't bad for what you get and they are always SO good! I usually get a turkey sandwich and lately I have been getting mine on a flatbread to save calories, but honestly I like it better than the regular bread! The bacon is really good quality and is AMAZING on your sandwich after it goes through the oven and gets all warm and sizzling! All of the meats are great quality and as someone who is very picky about meat, that means a lot. My boyfriend always gets \"The Wreck\" and I have tried it too, if you are having trouble deciding which sandwich to get I would definitely get this one. My boyfriend loves how they have \"Big\" sizes available for larger appetites! Their cookies are really, really good too! I wish I could get one every time! This is place is usually packed when I come here, and for good reason. However packed it is though, I usually get my food pretty quickly. Another plus is that they have calorie counts for all of the sandwiches and extra toppings on the menu, which is super helpful for me. I never get sandwiches from anywhere but here, you just can't get any better."}
{"text":"This place has been on my To Do List for some time now.  After reading the menu online, I finally went there for lunch.  I ordered:

Italian Sandwich (Capicola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami & Provolone Cheese), $5
Zapps Chips, $1.10

There are a few things that make this sandwich shop unique:
+ The Bread is thinner than most (see my pics).
+ They offer Hot Peppers that are like Giardiniera...and they're hot.
+ They have Zapps Chips...very hard to find outside of the South.

The Sandwich is toasted and is very tasty.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The Hot Peppers are legitimately spicy and add flavor to the Sandwich.  I love Zapps Chips and was very happy to see it offered here for sale.

The employees here are very friendly and helpful with making your Sandwich.  The only complaint is that when I asked for a 'Big' sized Sandwich (30% larger according to their website), they said they don't have Big Sandwiches yet....what?  Why have it on your website then?  Logic would tell you not to post it on your website....or at least post that it's \"coming soon\".  Anyway, it's not the employees at the store's fault, that's a corporate office problem.

The store has plenty of indoor seating and a small outdoor seating area as well.  I was there on a Saturday at 11:15 and it was pretty busy.  I would expect them to be really busy on weekdays for lunch.

I'll have to come back when they have 'Big' Sandwich options ready.

{"text":"Around 8p, I was craving a sandwich really really bad and so I had my husband pick up sandwiches at Potbelly. My order: original tuna salad sandwich on multigrain with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, mustard and mayo. For the price of around $5, they give you a nice size sandwich. I only could eat half of mine. I like how they toast the bread. However, I think the tuna salad was a little bland. I could barely taste the mayo or mustard. It did hit the spot though and I was pretty content after eating my sandwich."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day.  I was a first timer and my co-workers were raving about this place so I thought, \"What the heck.\" We walked in and there was a line of people and it was pretty loud.  While waiting in line, a worker was getting orders so that the process would go faster.  I ordered a turkey sub with bacon.  She told me the bacon was extra and I would have to tell the counter the extra toppings.  I get to the counter and I can't see anything!  The counter made me feel like I was a shrimp - I think I saw the top of one of the worker's head.  I screamed to her and told her I had a turkey sub.  She tells me to go to the left and I scream to the next person my toppings (lettuce, tomato, etc).  The sandwich was $6 so I thought, hmm..not bad.  I get to my seat and open the sandwich out of the bag and realized that the sub was pretty darn small - no wonder it was $6.  I also realized that I didn't have bacon.  If you want somewhere quick, I would probably recommend it, but I don't plan to come back anytime soon.  

The oatmeal chocolate chip cookie was good, but its not good enough where I would go back."}
{"text":"Well, I might be a little biased since this was one of my go to sandwich shops in college. However no matter the location or the time of day the potbelly franchise never seems to disappoint.

I decided to try this location out during prime lunchtime in uptown Charlotte... Which could be a risky move being that it is located right in the heart of the business world uptown. But (not to my surprise) The service was fast, friendly and RIGHT! When you have a continuous line that's snaked through your business it can be hard to keep your service on point at all times, especially during lunch \"rush-hour.\"

This location, just like many of the others, was staffed with a generous amount of employees who were all friendly and accommodating throughout your experience. They do a really great job keeping the line moving in making sure your order is correct. I mean, you would think when sandwiches are made in front of you it is hard to mess up, but that isn't always the case, so I always appreciate that extra TLC from my sandwich artist.

Although my go-to is the pizza sandwich here (which I always plan to try something else, but always default to what I know and love), everyone I go with get something else and I've never heard a complaint! Not to mention I took a to potbelly newbies with me when I went to this location and without a doubt they will be back! The only thing we all agreed on is that we wish we could get larger sandwiches because every time you finish you want more!

Job well done on keeping the franchise on top of the sandwich game and staying one of my favorite sandwich shops regardless of what location I visit across the country!!"}
{"text":"We ordered food for the office.   I had ordered it Friday for Monday.  I went in to pick it up, Iyes they have delivery but you know you have to get out of the office), and everything was ready.  We ordered 3 salads.  awesome.  2 individual sandwiches , a bowl of soup.  And a Basic Belly.  I had never ordered the basic belly...  which is a box of sandwiches with chips and all the works)  Anyway....  they were great.   I would recommend these if you are having an office function .  Thanks again Potbelly!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!! its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more. My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasn't the same, it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there. The regular ham with added bacon is the best!!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried a potbelly sandwich I had the tuna and I've git to say it was quite tasty. Next time we went there my husband tried their enchilada soup and the chili, He enjoyed it. Next time I go there I really want to try their shakes..."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are so bomb! Usually when you night a toasted sandwich, it can be hard on your teeth and the sides of your mouth. But when you bite into these sandwiches, it's so smooth. The ingredients make it so juicy. This is my second time coming here and it's honestly so great. Also they're sweet tea is sooooo bomb"}
{"text":"The meatball sandwich was really good. Now, five stars on service. I forgot my wallet and they don't take ApplePay, but instead of giving them a low rating for not having it, I'll give them 5 because they handled it really well. They let me take the food, and it was uncomfortable because I like paying for my own stuff. But that was a good gesture."}
{"text":"I love Potbelly! Fresh hot subs made right in front of you -delicious! The independence location is always clean and the workers there have always been extremely nice! 

I used to always order the Wreck but then discovered the pizza sub and it's delicious! Their soups are very good! I believe it's the chicken enchilada soup (something like that!) that I love! And he dream dessert bar is delicious too. 

Its my go to sub place in Independence!"}
{"text":"I needed one more Potbelly's fix before I moved back down south. Thanks to Yelp it wasn't a long hop off the highway before I ended up here. I ordered the Sicilian and it was still tasty and delicious. I don't know how long this Potbelly's has been opened but it was a little disorganized than I'm used to for a Potbelly's. There were three staff members crowded around something, at first, I thought they were just bsing but it looked like they had trouble with something before I got someone's attention."}
{"text":"The only other Potbelly locations I have frequented were in Washington D.C.  I was wandering around in Downtown Phoenix and came upon this location.  It was a Saturday, right before 4pm when I waltzed through the double doors.  The place was deserted- but that was probably because they close at 4 p.m. On Saturday.  The nice lady behind the counter assured me that she could whip me up a sandwich in no time... So i placed my order, grabbed a sack of their \"Zapp's\" potato chips, and waited.  Her Sandwich creation was ready ~5 minutes later.  The Sandwich was delicious!  As I was waiting around I noticed that there is actually a lot of sitting space in this place. They even have a small patio, if you preferred to sit outside- which I did."}
{"text":"Exceptionally delicious. Inexpensive. Lots of variety. Fresh ingredients. Fast, friendly service. We had turkey blts, cheddar broccoli soup, bottled drinks from the fridge and dream bars. Both of us ate for 25 dollars even for a lot of really good food. The ranch dressing is SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Not really what I was expecting, but okay. I wasn't entirely impressed when I walked in and wasn't greeted by anyone. Being new I really didn't know where to order, or what the process was. I had to ask all that. It took a bit to take our order. It just seemed unorganized and slow. I did however like my sandwich,  it wasn't bad. It just didn't wow me like I thought it would."}
{"text":"Good pizza sandwich.  Like the pepper relish to give an extra kick.  Always clean and food is made fresh & quick"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich shops. Great quality sandwhiches and food as well as great customer service."}
{"text":"YUMMY! I think this was the best sandwich I have ever had. When I walked into the restaurant with my stroller, one of the workers asked if I would like to give them my order at the table instead of waiting in line with the baby. Score! Anyone willing to make my life easier at this point earns major kudos from me. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, chips, and a large drink. I also orders an Italian sandwich to-go for the hubster. The sandwiches were huge--all for $13. The hot peppers, which is what Potbelly is famous for, really make the sandwich heavenly! The peppers give the sandwich a little bite. SO good! Well Potbelly, you are my new go-to place, replacing your across the street neighbor in my weekly repertoire!"}
{"text":"This place just opened on 31st and Peoria.  Today was my first time and I ordered a chicken and cheddar sandwich on wheat multigrain ordered \"sliced thin\" for less bread, all of the toppings listed including the hot peppers.  It was toasted.  First, the employees were very friendly, asking me if it was my first time, asking how my day was, and discussing my sandwich options.  They all seemed to like working in the sandwich shop.  Prices were very reasonable with sandwiches ranging from $4.80 to $6+ and the calories are listed, which is most helpful.  There are also soups and salads and the place is very clean.  I liked the hot peppers which were hot enough to really light up your sandwich but not burn your mouth, and you can buy a jar right there for home. The \"sliced thin\" option was smart- some of us watch our carbs but still want a sandwich and having wheat multigrain is a good choice.  My only complaint is the smallest drink is still $2.00, next size up $2.25.  I think a $1.50 drink option would have been better.  Iced tea was good though, just too expensive.  I will definitely be back for more because everything tasted really really good."}
{"text":"Went to the one in cleveland and it was excellent. Went to the one in Mayfield, OH was terrible. Mac N Cheese was cold, pizza sandwich was also cold and tasted funny with the mushrooms being raw. I will try once more if no good then I will not return."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people love it so much, I think they're just like a sandwich you could make in 2 minutes at your house.  I guess it's cheap semi-healthy fastfood, just not for me."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that this Potbellys is now open! The Wreck sandwich is so delicious! I always go to Potbellys every time I go to D.C. Or NYC, but now it's available in Phoenix! I live in LA but go to Phoenix to work every few weeks. I make sure I stop for a sandwich every time I'm in town. I hope you all come to LA soon! I'll be waiting! 

Also get their ice cream sandwich! They will make it with whatever cookies you want!"}
{"text":"My first visit to a PBSS and I'd go back.  The \"Wreck\"  was the name for that sub that was anything but a wreck: \"Black Angus roast beef, old world salami, oven roasted turkey breast\", hickory smoked ham and real Swiss cheese.  It was not particularly large but was tasty and adequately filling - if barely.  I had the \"thin cut\" version which contained about a third less bread, a nice fresh tasting whole grain (my idea of a balanced diet: slim bread and an Oreo shake.  Brand spanking new store is clean and attractive. Service was friendly and efficient though there were not enough customers to say how well they'd handle a crowd. Sandwich and shake: $8.  I'd go back - and maybe I'll go wild and have the regular bread to see if their \"full-size\" version stacks up better to the similar but considerably larger and definitely more-filling \"Traffic Jam\" sandwich at Stickler's in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Being a foodie, I do enjoy finding places that are worthy of my business and in this day and age, those businesses are becoming increasingly rare.  As evidenced by the \"for lease\" signs polluting our neighborhoods.  Well, I'm happy to say that Potbelly won't be forcing their landlord to buy any of those signs anytime soon.  It seems that Jim has selected people who match the core beliefs of the corporation.  Friendly and efficient.  They offer wonderfully fresh products and combinations prepared by a staff full of people who are eager to show off their dental work.  They are all smiling.  No one seems grumpy or disgusted with their jobs.  They want to get people through the line in under 8 minutes which anyone in an actual lunch hour should appreciate and my favorite, they offer sweet tea.  Not southern sweet that allows for a diabetic coma afterward, just a taste to make me smile.  I can't name the people who positively impacted my experience completely but I will give a shout out to my Homie, Hannah, who went above and beyond to make sure I was a happy camper.  Thanks y'all, you're doing it right."}
{"text":"Potbelly sandwiches, what a hype machine! After months of hearing about their \"amazing\" subs that supposedly make customers \"salivate\" at the mere thought of eating one its easy to say I was quite intrigued and excited to see that the location nearby my apartment had finally opened. Deciding to stop in for a quick bite before work, I was immediately hit with a good vibe. Decor is well done here. Everything fits the sandwich stop demeanor quite well. Simple menu. Simpler ordering. What could go wrong?

Needless to say things were going well at the start of my experience. It's obvious the store just opened though as the massive crowd of employees, probably being trained, were doing jobs meant for a team half the size. Not a bad thing per say, just an observation. 

I decided on getting \"The Wreck,\" a sandwich with salami, roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss. An interesting ensemble of deli meats but sonically appetizing nonetheless. Whole grain bread, mayo, hot peppers, lettuce, onions, and tomato are My usual toppings and as such I had all of them put on the sandwich. I really appreciate them being upfront about caloric values of each item of the menu as well. 

Service was incredibly smooth. Probably the greatest part of my first Potbelly  experience and I definitely hand it to the management for getting a team that large to function cohesively. Also putting the potato salad in front of the cash register was a clever way to get suckers like me to add one to the order... God knows i couldn't resist.

Unfortunately, I wish I could say the food impressed me nearly as much as the service. First and foremost is the lackluster bread. While I appreciate the bread avoiding the oddly popular \"air bread\" motif places like subway serve, the taste just was not there. Dry, flaky, and dull. Not my cup of tea. The quantity of meat is average for a sandwich shop of this type. Just enough was placed on to assure myself that I wasn't being blatantly ripped off. I just wish the quality of the meat was any good. Before delving in, I pulled one piece of each meat to taste individually from the sandwich itself. Not much to say about it except that if I wanted Hillshire Farms caliber meat I'd make the sandwich myself. Strike two. The lettuce I received was reaching expiration as well. Many of the strands of lettuce had slightly brown edges and my god was there an immense amount of it. Without going into too much more detail I think it's safe to say the sandwich itself was really nothing to write home about. Incredibly average and sometimes subpar components? No thanks. Luckily my potato salad was tasty, but who cares? I came here for the sandwich. 

Probably wont be returning here. Potbelly gets three stars only decor and great service. The food however needs some work and since its a chain, I highly doubt the change will ever come. Thankfully I only spent about $7..."}
{"text":"Really great sandwich 
Chicken and cheddar... whole wheat options... my co traveler had the pizza he said it was great to"}
{"text":"Warning: The chocolate brownie cookies must be loaded with crack, because they are extremely addictive. Broccoli cheese soup is phenomenal, and the sandwich (Italian) was good as well. 10/10 would eat again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"It was a great sandwich and great service.
The guy forgot cheese. I insisted he just throw some cheese on it and call it a day bit he insisted on making a new one.....awesome service right there....coulda slap cheese on it and said see ya but he didn't.....he took a few extra steps to insure my sandwich was perfecto....
They also give police officers free sandwiches ..seen it happen...thanks PotBelly

{"text":"No way will I ever return  having to tell 3 or for people what i ordered after the order was placed suckso"}
{"text":"Potbelly is ok, but I don't like them nearly as much as other places. Their sandwiches and shakes are both good, but mostly average. I'm in love with the cute little cookies they put around the straws. It's a silly small thing, but I love it so.

The thing that really stands out about Potbelly is the atmosphere. It's really comfy and perfect to relax in. I would not say the same for almost any other sub shop.

If you're looking for quality, go else where. If you're looking for atmosphere, this is the place you should go for subs."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place. Bread tastes freshly baked. During regular semester time, the place is always full and there's always a line but you don't have to stand in line for more than 5 minutes (!). The service is super-fast. My favorite is grilled chicken with cheddar."}
{"text":"Potbelly's reminds me a lot of Quiznos but their bread is so much better. It was fast and the staff was friendly. Prices are very reasonable. They had everything almost put away when I walked in an hour before they close, but I will be coming back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"another sandwich shop that offers delivery, but only has a one mile radius delivery area. i just can't understand what the point of having the service is if you only deliver to such a tiny area.  this restaurant is extremely close to me (1.3 miles-yeah i checked my gps, whatever!), and yet those .3 miles mean i'm unable to get delivery. 

their sandwiches are actually pretty tasty, but sometimes i'm lazy (errr hungover) and want my food brought to me. the fact that i know they offer delivery and can't make it to my house totally bums me out."}
{"text":"There was so much hype when it opened. And after standing in line for 10 min, my Buffalo chicken sandwich was well worth it. Service is great and the taste is amazing. Will be going back to try the other items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"My wife ordered two sandwiches at the drive thru. Both were supposed to come with lettuce and tomato. Got home--no lettuce or tomato on either sandwich. She called and spoke to a manager who offered to remake the sandwiches. I drove back and they gave me the new sandwiches. Not a single apology or offer of a future discount for our troubles until I said, \"Thanks I guess,\" then the cashier offered a half-hearted, \"Yeah I'm sorry, it happens...you know.\"  That was all we got. They even took back the old sandwiches that were missing lettuce and tomato. I figured the food must be amazing if they didn't want to give any away for free or at a discount. Wrong! The chicken on the chicken and cheddar was bland. Bread was burnt. Absolutely zero flavor. My wife said her turkey sandwich was dry and bland as well. 

If you want to eat a bland sandwich and receive poor customer service, check out Potbelly's in Gilbert on Market Street before they go out of business."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very clean, just enough food options and the staff was super friendly! Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an inexpensive, delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of sandwiches, with a very friendly staff to back it up. The place is obviously geared towards the college crowd, but it's still really nice for those of us who think we're grown up. Definitely a place I'll try again."}
{"text":"Quite good. Very busy at noon! They take partial orders while in line, speeding the process so don't be intimidated. It went fast. Food was good. The hot parts were hot, the cold parts were cold! The prices were very reasonable. Two lunches with drinks, under $15."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time!  6\" hoagie roll chicken and cheddar with all the fixin's . Done and done."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Great friendly service too! Uptown salad was awesome! We will definitely be back! Thank you! :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I'll keep this short and simple.

Its in a fantastic area right by the Mall. Its in sort of a new build area. So everything was pretty new inside. Seating was abundant. We both got a sub and soup.

The menu itself had a decent amount to choose from. It consisted of sandwiches, soup, salad, cookies, chips etc.

Overall nothing was amazing about this place. Not sure if we ordered the wrong thing perhaps. It was a little flavorless. It reminded me of an upscale subway or quiznos but with less flavor. I feel bad, but thats my opinion.

Another thing that made it kind of awkward was the manager. With this place being new it looks like they had 2 new hires. The manager was being a dick to one of them while training. Thats at least what it appeared to be from my point of view.

I won't be back in a rush anytime soon. Maybe if I find myself back here, I'll try and get it up to a 4 or maybe 5 stars :)"}

{"text":"Gotta love Potbelly's and those hot peppers.  This is by far one of my favorite sandwich chains.  The Tempe spot isn't quite as good as they are back east, but its still delicious.

Highly recommended for lunch.  Right near ASU."}
{"text":"We ordered a group lunch for our office on Monday.   How do you mess up a meatball sub?   It was on a dry multigrain roll which took up most of the sandwich; who does a meatball sub on a multigrain roll? There was a small amount of dry and flavorless meatballs, and next to no sauce, as well as no noticeable cheese. It was inedible. And no side salads available either; not that that would have made up for the sandwich. We order team lunches a couple times a month and we will not be using Potbelly again."}
{"text":"Best sandwich around!  I used to love the location in Chicago!  Now we have one here!  They have a secret peanut butter and jelly you can order that's not on the menu.  The TCB flat bread sandwich and the wreck are my favorites."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated ! There are other better options out there which more for the bucks ! Their regular size original sandwich is like 6 inches subway sandwich (feels smaller than that) and over priced for what it's worth. With a regular sandwich small soup and ice tea it was like $14 ... WTH ! and I was still hungry !"}
{"text":"Potbelly, you have been handed the torch.

It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.  Its not you, its me.  I promise.

I love italian-style subs.  The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic.  The Wreck salad is also great (for a salad).  

This place is my new go to sub shack."}
{"text":"Cool place!  The girl at the counter promptly took my order and made several recommendations. I decided to go with the chicken salad and I was very satisfied!  Perfect amount of mayo blend and the multigrain bread is very flavorful."}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time! Very pleasant experience! Staff was warm, friendly, with a sense of humor, and they knew their products! I had the Italian with hot peppers that had a strong solid kick along with a bowl of potato soup for a good neutralization. Very good and the prices are more than reasonable. With such informative and light hearted employees I'll be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Food was good, I want to make that clear. The hot peppers are delicious and the sub was toasted perfectly in my opinion. With that being said, I couldn't help but notice this location had quite poor service. Straws empty, wrong meat in my sub, and communication between crew members for -- milkshake orders, online orders, etc..-- was very ineffective. Overall, a good experience in general cuz it's Potbelly? just think a better experience could be achieved in a mall like West Towne."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sandwich selection for an awesome price. Chicago-style sandwich shop. They do have military discount, however it depends on the manager. Healthy choice alternatuve, great customer service. I have not tried their malts, but if they are as deliciius as their sandwiches, you will nit be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and very thoughtful employees!  Might I suggest the buffalo grilled sandwich."}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich spot. Shakes are yummy, sandwiches rock my socks, cookies are delicious, etc. Smoothies are okay. Dream bar is amazing."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me and hyped it up a great deal, so I was super excited to come here! I decided to order the \"special\" as in what they recommend I try. In this case, I got \"The Wreck\". How they made the sandwich was simple and clean, toasting the bread for a solid minute or so. After that they build the sandwich in front of you, it was well presented and made. Now onto the big part: The taste.

The sandwich itself was good, with the main ingredients being Salami, Roast Beef, Turkey, Ham, & Swiss Cheese. It was clean to eat and was warm due to coming straight out of the oven.

The main reason why i'm giving this place 3 stars is due to the simplicity and lack of ingredients. While the ingredients were good, it felt like I was eating meat on bread with melted cheese, not a well crafted and thought out sandwich with a multitude of complex and intricate flavors.

Overall, this place is much better than Quiznos, Subway, or Jimmy Johns. I plan on stopping by occasionally, but it won't be my go to place."}
{"text":"There is a lot of attitude when answering questions at this place. I can only hope that this is not indicative of other Potbelly's locations; however, I probably won't go to one."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and I always look for them in each town I go too.  Super good, hot and fresh and usually great service....Try them out and get the spicy pickle stuff...its soo good.  Wreck for ever"}
{"text":"I stopped into Potbelly on a Saturday afternoon. The store is clean and the staff was friendly. They gave me a quick run down of the process since I had never been in before. I ordered a turkey sandwich and got mini cookies as well.

The process and the sandwich itself reminded me of Quiznos. They send it through the toaster and then you have your choice of cold toppings. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the bread was good too - nice crusty French bread.

Overall the sandwich was good but not a real knockout per se. Maybe I was expecting more since I had heard people raving about this place. If you like toasted subs, you'll like it. Would I go back? Sure. Would I go out of my way to go back? Not likely, especially if there was a Jimmy Johns closer."}
{"text":"Never been to this chain, so I figured I'd give it a try. For me, the best part was the drive through. I was in the area for a meeting and heading home. Didn't want the usual fast food and didn't have time to walk in or sit down at a restaurant. This was a great compromise. 
I got the roast beef and added mushrooms. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and quality. Reminded me a bit of roast beef sandwiches the day after you had roast for dinner. I happen to like that, kind of like when you have a turkey sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. 
My service was prompt, friendly,  and correct. Can't ask for much more from a drive through.
I'll stop in again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Decent food and service. Typical sub shop. They offer a large and small. Home made cookies are delicious! The outside seating is a nice touch, and I did see many people trying out the shakes. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich joint that offers several types of sandwiches on good bread with great ingredients. I had the turkey club and the pieces of turkey were quite large in the sandwich. The bread was nicely toasted, bacon was on point, and the overall taste of the sandwich had great flavor and texture. I would go to this place again next time I am in the area. 

The staff is very friendly, but with all the noise behind them you may have to ask them to speak up. They have a nice wood country feel in the interior."}
{"text":"This place has great food! I highly recommend the pizza sandwich! It's amazing!! Clean place with barely any line and a nice staff. It's right across from Royal Ontario Museum, so it's in a good location too! 5/5"}
{"text":"We're not from here so a friend referred us. We both got the skinny pair, ham and Swiss skinny sandwich and broccoli and cheddar soup. I'm not a huge fan of warm/toasted sandwiches but this one was SO GOOD! Though the skinny wasn't very filling for me I'll have to get a regular next time but my mom said she was stuffed. The soup was absolutely delicious probably the best broccoli and cheddar soup I've ever had. 100% recommend. Also the cookies are super good I had the sugar cookie and the others look yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite before a baseball game... Or anytime! I was so glad to see this place when I moved back to Cleveland from Chicago because it was one of my favorite sandwich places in Chicago. And now it's here! Here! I can get my fix!

My favorite sandwich is the mushroom melt--cheese, mushroom, yummy. I also like the ham, but I always add mushrooms to it. I tend to find that all of their sandwiches are delicious with the \"everything but the mayo\" toppings, but you can mix and match to your taste :) The hot peppers are definitely spicy, but they have a nice addition of onions, carrots, and a few other delicious pickled surprises. Make sure you grab an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie! Especially if it's warm. Those cookies are to die for."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and personable, and the food was tasty and fairly priced. For the same price as subway you get a quality sandwich with real bread!"}
{"text":"We went here when the location first opened. I had the pizza sandwich and there was barely anything in the sandwich and no flavor. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and again no flavor or substance. We were going to eat there but decided go home and add to our sandwiches. The staff was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"While there was nothing wrong with my meal, it was nothing great. My biggest complaint is with the service. Potbelly is a chain, but I have always enjoyed their food when I was in Chicago. I was kind of excited to see the signs up when they started moving in to a plaza not far from my house. Potbelly makes sandwiches and also has soups, and some desserts (milkshakes and cookies, mostly). 

When I came in, there was only one guy working, and I felt bad for him. Despite him seemingly working alone, he was friendly and trying to multi-task as best he could. There was a couple ahead of me, and while I was waiting three more people came in. The guy called for assistance, so a woman who seemed really irked by my presence came to help. When it was my turn to check out (a few more people had come in at this point), the guy politely told me one minute. I told him no hurry, I was getting my food to go. Then a woman who had been sitting in the dining room came to ring me out.... I guess she worked there? She continued to have a conversation with one of her friends while sort of ringing me out. She complained repeatedly about having to be at work, which made me want to just walk out. 

Nothing like a completely average meal that was slightly over-priced with customer service that makes a person feel like they're inconveniencing employees. I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here. The place was nice and clean and the workers were very helpful. The only thing is I done think the meats are that good. I bought a meatball sub which was good but not great and a roast beef sandwich which I was really not fond of. The meat tastes cheap I unfortunately didn't finish and I just tossed it. Not the place for when wanting sandwiches. It's a personal preference."}
{"text":"I recently had a good experience with Potbelly in Chicago, and decided to check out their east side Madison location while running errands. The store is nicely decorated and kept up, and the staff was very friendly. 

I decided to repeat my order from my previous visit, but upgrade to the \"Bigs\" - a larger sandwich that would allow for lunch the next day. I opted for the turkey but subbed cheddar for the swiss and had lettuce, tomato, pickles, mustard, oil & seasonings. Everything was fine except for the sandwich maker being super stingy with the sauces. I know he didn't miss them because I saw him pick up the bottles, but I could only taste mustard on one bite. Overall everything was on the dry side. It was a fine sandwich, but skimping on mustard and oil & seasonings seems silly since neither is a premium item. 

You get a lot of food for a low price so I'd definitely stop here over Subway, but next time I'll ask them to go heavy on the mustard."}
{"text":"This place was pretty happening when a friend and I came in for lunch. There was a guy singing and playing the guitar, and we came in at peak lunch hour around noon. We both ordered the Mediterranean sandwich (only vegetarian option) and it was really good. She got the hot peppers on hers and I'll have to do that next time since I love spicy food. I got their tomato soup, pretty good."}
{"text":"I've only been here once before, a year ago. First time to this location and it was good. Ordered a Mediterranean veggie sandwich and added lettuce, tomatoes and hot peppers. Got a side of chips and a chocolate shake. Everything was yummy and service was quick. The only hiccup was that my friend's shake took longer to make because the guy forgot that she ordered one, so she had to go and remind them. 
I love that their shop actually smells good and like fresh bread, unlike another sub shop. I just wish they had better lunch specials and combos."}
{"text":"Love these Potbelly places. This location has a very good crew working together even when busy. Sandwich made perfectly and the store was big and very clean. Will go here again for sure."}
{"text":"The food and service are great please don't misconstrue that fact. I will also continue to go back, my only issue is parking, it's right beside Starbucks. Enough said huh. But get a parking spot and go enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, interesting sandwiches. I got the buffalo chicken and blue cheese sandwich, which was pretty good. Their beverage selection is nice, lots of juices, San pellegrino water and blood orange soda. Will come back to try more sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Potbelly but my boyfriend LOVES it. The reason why I rate this location so high is because he's vegetarian and they remember his order every time he comes in. The employees are so friendly and do a really great job. The lines are fast. The location is clean."}
{"text":"I love the food at Potbelly for a quick lunch or dinner, but I was extremely disappointed by my most recent visit and felt like I needed to post a review.

First of all, the service was terrible. The restaurant was empty but yet it took at least 15 minutes to get my salad and pay. We even had to ask to have someone come to the register. I didn't even get an apology for the wait.

What really put me over the edge was finding a piece of bacon in my vegetarian salad. I don't eat meat and haven't for a couple years, so this was extremely frustrating."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I LOVE POTBELLY'S and have been waiting for this location to open. I have been to the locations in Tempe and off of McDowell. Both locations are GREAT! Staff is on their game!! 
I am writing the review to encourage the management to seek more training with new staff. I heard a staff member say flat out \"we just opened so I have no idea\" to the customer behind me. There were 3 people standing behind the counter while my sandwich almost fell off the roller because the girl putting the extras on the sandwiches was swamped and the girl putting the meat and bread together just kept putting them through. Another staff member even told the girl to fix it and didn't even help. 
To make this location as awesome as it could be make sure staff is trained. This is a great location and most of us in the neighborhood are excited for more restaurants."}
{"text":"I go here way too often. Since I work in the same complex, I tend to go here about 3 times a week. Potbelly's is honestly pretty similar to a Quiznos in that they specialize in toasted sub sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Wreck (salami, roast beed, turkey and ham), the Pizza Sandwich (meatball and pepperoni) and the classic Meatball. They also have pretty good chili and milkshakes; what else do you need right?"}
{"text":"I never heard of this place until one appeared in north Scottsdale so I checked it out. I've ordered two sandwiches from here so far and loved them. My favorite is the Pizza Sandwich; a sub with pepperoni and meatballs, its quite impressive. Pricing isn't too bad with a sandwich, chips and a drink running around $8 to $10. Definitely worth trying if you wanna mix it up from the normal Subways and Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"This Potbelly is located on Concourse C inside Cleveland Hopkins International Airport - just across from Gate C29. It's relatively new - there used to be a Chinese food joint in this spot.

I was stuck in the Airport for an extra four hours or so due to flight delays - so U hit this place for lunch. Ordered a Wreck on multi-grain wheat, with lettuce, tomato, onion, hot peppers, may, oil, and vinegar, and a bottle of water.

Food came up fast - Tasty sandwich!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches!  They have a delicious sandwich called The Clubbie that is not listed on the menu. It is ham, bacon, turkey, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and ranch dressing, toasted on your choice of bread. Give it a try! Get the oil and Italian seasoning. There is live entertainment which made for a fun experience. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop hands down.  This place is my favorite!  I was introduced to Potbelly while living in Texas.  Was so glad to see that they came to AZ.  There are a variety of toppings that you can pick from (the hot peppers are by far the best).  Give Potbelly a try for yourself.  It is a great place to have a sandwich that goes beyond your basic cold sandwich."}
{"text":"I got their new philly cheese steak sandwich and it was delicious.  The employee who helped me was super friendly and helpful as well.  Good quality food!  My fiance got a cup of the baked potato soup and the mac and cheese and he was surprised by how good both items were!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Mediterranean salad and balsamic dressing, good for fast food. Nice healthy choices as well."}
{"text":"Pretty average food.  The place itself and the employees are nice. Came to Phoenix to see a game and was pretty disappointed with the downtown area all together. Not many options for eating establishments."}
{"text":"For me Potbelly's is just okay; nothing great but not terrible. Idk why but it's hard to find an amazing sandwich place that offers something crave'able, does just about everything right, has the perfect toppings or toasts the bread the best or just has that factor where you're like \"let's go\"! I've been to Potbelly's around the lunch and dinner rushes a handful of times and what's weird is they never seem busy. 

I have noticed though that this place is bit stingy on the meats. The sandwich I got (The Wreck) supposed to come w 4 diff meats and I added extra turkey; not very reflective from the pic. Also, this past visit while checking out I asked the cashier lady for a small side of hot peppers they keep by the register (not sure why) and as she pulled one cup out it was wrapped in few strands of long hair ..  - They finally came around in 2018 and offer a kids meal now so that's gd."}
{"text":"Man I love this place!  They don't SCREAM at you when you walk through the door or ask for donations at the register like another local sub joint does  ;-)  Instead I'm always greeted by enthusiastic professional crew members that are fantastic at their job!  The owner even remembered my order details after not going for quite some time.  Nice small town feeling! 

I've been coming here since they opened and I have to say the food and service are always consistent.  It is my opinion that a sub sandwich that's toasted needs to be eaten right away to fully enjoy. If you only get a hot sub to go, try it and find it soggy or otherwise not to your liking, try the same one dining in instead and see the difference! 

I used to think their meatball subs were very good and got them once a week. Ordered them to go and drove 1 mile opened it up and had a good meal.  When I finally decided to dine in I had the same meatball sub and it went from very good to AMAZING!!  The bread was nice and crisp and there was a toasty crunch when you bite into the sub that wasn't as pronounced when it was wrapped up even if for only a few minutes.

Meatball sub is the 'wettest' variety that you'll encounter here but what about the other types offered?  There is something to be said for the bread being hot and the ingredients of your sub still having some of their original crunch and texture. Anyone old enough to remember the MCDONALD'S McD. LT?  The packaging kept lettuce and such on 1 side and meat on the other until you combine them. Similar concept, don't let hot food stay wrapped up or your whole meal will become less than awesome! 

Like it says on the wall \"YA GOTTA GET IT HOT \""}
{"text":"Food: It's Potbelly's. Feels less like fast food and more like real food.

Service: Most of the staff is fast and professional, but there are times in the mid afternoon when it seems that there's only one person behind the counter, and the advertised \"service in 10 minutes or less\" goes out the window. It can be aggravating to watch one employee juggle food prep, phone orders, and check-out.

Overall: One of the better fast food choices near CWRU."}
{"text":"Purchased food from here during a lengthy layover. Received two sandwiches, chips and a drink for 14 dollars, which for the airport, was pretty great.  Came late on a Saturday, and it was one of the few places still open. Customer service was excellent, everyone was pleasant. Obviously there are not too many options, as it is a sandwich shop. They do however sell desserts as well."}
{"text":"Great subs for a low price.  The wreck and pizza subs are my favorite.  Pickles and side salads are good too.  I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I liked the decor and its location but for the price you should go to Quiznos. The sandwich was okay, nothing special. Place was dead on a Sunday for sure! Perhaps if the food wasn't so small for the price it would be better."}
{"text":"Sigh... What has happened to this place? Sandwiches are ok, but the cookies used to be so big and good. Now they're about half the size and the same price! No real reason to come back..."}
{"text":"They were sloppy and confused and slow and totally completely messed up one of my sandwiches. 

Highlight? The blonde woman who wears glasses. Organized, quick, helpful. Super duper. Give that woman a raise!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love potbelly.

It's fresh, menu is simple and their soup is goood! 

I get the wreck with broccoli cheddar soup:) 
Yummmy!"}
{"text":"Food is good,  Their fat free dressing is pretty yummy too.  And if you love shakes, you must try EVERY SINGLE shake flavor they offer."}
{"text":"The food was alright, not the best sandwich I've had but it tasted good. I don't understand why they only serves one size sandwiches. Most of the staff was decent and well mannered. However I will never return here as long as that bald guy works here. He was completely unprofessional to my girlfriend and rude to both of us. If that is their idea of customer service, I do not want to experience it ever again. Best thing about the area it is in is there are plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place. Really good fast subs thaT meet quality of the pallet. I WILL BE BACK SOON. Had the Italian with mushrooms and bacon it was fabulous a must try."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop had awesome bread and chicken salad sandwich was really good. You can add cranberries on it too you if you want. I would have given this a five-star if they had avacado and a salt pepper mix to add to my sandwich."}
{"text":"I go to potbelly's quite often in central Phoenix. I stopped in here being in Scottsdale for lunch. The food is always good but this is about the people. I was really impressed with how the employees treated everyone. A big welcome walking in and very helpful. Way to go guys!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and salads but the service level has dropped greatly. Staff in the past was warm, courteous seemed appreciative of business. Now they seem to view customers as an interruption. Disappointing but lots of other options in the area."}
{"text":"Competing against Jimmy John's and Subway can't be that difficult. Regardless, Potbelly is my clear choice of quick sandwich shop. Potbelly has more options than either competitor and does a better job as well. My favorite thing about Potbelly is that you have options whether you just need a smaller bite (Mushroom Melt) or a full meal and a half (a Big plus a shake and a cookie). 

I do have a few complaints about this location. The music is super loud inside the bathrooms. Sometimes the back line is understaffed and the line backs up. The layout is efficient, but two Potbelly employees can't keep up when there are a dozen customers."}
{"text":"Had the  Italian Sandwich.  It was good but I think I am partial to Jimmy John's.  Service is really great though. Everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"This place is very friendly. Its like an upgraded Subway with its sandwiches.

I like how they have different versions of the same type of sandwich depending on your calorie consumption. 

I had the Mediterranean Big multi-grain sandwich with chicken. The hummus was really tasty. My boyfriend had the Big Wreck in multi-grain and it was tasty as well, specially the hot peppers.  The bread truly was my favorite!   I also had the  chicken pot pie and you can tell its made with fresh vegetables. We had the oreo shake and it wasn't bad. I would recommend this place for sandwich lovers or soup lovers, at least come check it out.

They have dessert, but I didn't try their cookies nor smoothies nor malts, so maybe next time."}
{"text":"Well, we finally tried it. Huge success! Turkey sandwiches and potato soup hit the SPOT. Thanks for the clean store, guitarist, and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Generally we like their sandwiches. This time we decided to branch out and purchase some salads and soup as well as the typical sandwiches. However the person taking my order was rude and very short with me, (like impatient and rushing) both while taking my order and at the window for payment. I have a really hard time understanding why he would feel the need to rush me when there was no one behind me. Then when we got home we were super disappointed in the salads. Some of the lettuce was like what would be appropriate for a wedge salad. Giant hunks of iceberg lettuce. 
The combine made me feel like I should have taken my chances in the long line at the costa vida across the street."}
{"text":"This will be my new goto lunch spot. A week after opening and it seems like they have all of their kinks worked out. The long lunch line moves pretty quick - a little over 10 minutes to get my sandwich. They don't have the full menu but will probably have that in the next 6 months. They also said online ordering should be ready by March 1st. Their focus is having everything operating smoothly before bringing in more which looks like it's working pretty well."}
{"text":"they deliver.  it snowed about 5 inches today.  i'm too busy to go anywhere for lunch most of the time.  you can only eat jimmy johns so many times per week.  need i say more?"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite sandwich shop! They have a great selection of sandwiches, but you can also customize things or do a build your own style. Personally love getting the wreck sandwich! Getting the hot peppers toasted on the sandwich itself is a must try! They have other items as well, the salads are great too, but once I tried the wreck I can't go back! The service is always incredibly friendly and they make great recommendatios. They keep the restaurant well cleaned and maintained as well."}
{"text":"I ate at the Pot Belly's at University Circle, decided to try the Independence location since I was out this way. I tried a new sandwich this time and it was good. It's called the wreck, it had salami, turkey, roast beef and ham. I for sure got cookies and the chips. This location is clean, smaller in tables but they have outside seating for when the weather is nice. The staff was friendly and they were fast, even with a phone order before my order. I know this is a chain but give PotBelly's a try!"}
{"text":"I have been to Potbelly Sandwich shop in Columbus before, and it was good. They are fairly priced, with plenty of options to choose from (sandwiches, cookies, chips, bottle drinks).  To start off, it was toasted and the sandwich was good. I would go back for the sandwich for sure. The New Orleans style Kettle chips are good as well. I got an oatmeal chocolate chip and sugar cookie and they are excellent. They have plenty of seating inside, if you want to eat inside. I know this a bad reason for 4 stars, the parking situation is terrible and it's in a busy location. On the other hand, it's a very nice area for shops and other restaurants."}
{"text":"A fantastic sub from a chain sandwich shop?  It does exist!  I'll happily let Potbelly fill stomach with its tasty food anytime.

I went with \"a wreck\" which appears to be Potbelly's signature sandwich.  Salami, roast beef, turkey, ham and swiss; how can you go wrong?  The multi-grain bread is fantastic, and I piled on most of the fixings which made made for a perfect lunch.  Make sure to have the hot peppers, they really add to the flavor.  The regular is fairly small, but only $5.  I recommend going with a big size, or maybe having a cup of soup or chips or something as a side.

Potbelly delivers a meal head and shoulders above its peers.  Easy online ordering from its website will allow you to skip what certainly must be a crowded cityscape lunch line.  Ditch the nearby Jimmy John's and Subway and give the new place in town a try."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I recommend the Cuban. Their giardiniera is great too, I usually get it on the Italian. I highly recommend the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.

I don't recommend ordering avocado though, they'll just charge you for it and not put it on your sandwich, like the last 2 times I ordered from them."}
{"text":"A great lunch spot.  The line only looks long at lunch because it moves at a nice rate.  Great sandwiches.  Lunch for less than $10.  Try my favorite - the grilled chicken and cheddar and don't forget to add bacon."}
{"text":"Really good food and friendly staff!!!!!! I got the wreck sandwich with hot peppers and it was delicious!!!! Good quality meat, peppers were just the right heat and the bread was really good! The broccoli cheese soup was really good also, a little on the salty side but I like it like that!! And last the farmhouse salad!!! Solid salad, good flavors and otnos big!!! Overall definitely going to go there again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at any Potbelly, but my first time at a stand-alone shop.  My very first time at a Potbelly was at an airport location, and I could've sworn it was in SLC, but I could be wrong.  The guy who took my order here said that I may have been at Chicago's Midway airport, but I always use O'Hare/ORD, so who knows?  And you're probably saying \"who cares?,\" right?  So on to the food...

Ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich with the special hot sauce.  And this sauce is truly special, because it only contains peppers and other seasonings, maybe water.  That's it.  No cornstarch, corn syrup, or other corn derivatives, or even mustard, or tomato sauce.  Nothing to keep me from ordering the sandwich.  And am I glad I tried it!  Had it on a whole grain whole wheat roll, and it came with blue cheese crumbles, as well.  Very delicious!  I also tried an oat-chocolate chip cookie that had only one questionable ingredient, which is palm oil.  No corn syrup, cornstarch, or baking powder!  Still very warm and full of semi-melted and gooey chocolate chips- HEAVEN!  The package says it contains 420 calories... I had a couple of bites and was good.  I suggest sharing it with friends, or be prepared to warm it up in its wax envelope in the microwave for about 45 seconds to soften it up.  Not quite as good as it was when fresh a few days before.  It was kind of sad, actually.  Better to just share it with someone else...

I'll definitely come back to try another sandwich, or perhaps a salad.  Potbelly sells hand-dipped milkshakes and yogurt smoothies, as well, but they're off-limits to me since both ice cream and smoothie bases contain corn syrup.  :("}
{"text":"Potbelly's, founded in Chicago in 1977, isn't your typical sandwich shop. Their website features a musical directory, for example, and espouses focus on green initiatives (their bags evidently save 945 lbs of Co2 emissions per annum). Community focus and social activism, aside, however, Potbelly's namesake may be taken to refer not only to the franchise's signature archaic stove marketing device with its cutesy chimney and cartoon flashes of heat, but to the guttural protuberance which inevitably results from even the briefest indulgence in its culinary offerings. The Mediterranean, one of the few non-meaty subs available, is a riotous mix of hummus, feta, artichoke, and cukes (sic: from website) and a healthy choice at first glance--at least stacked up against the Clubby or Pizza Sandwich. Indeed, it is fairly miniscule in stature (even a Large pales in girth to your standard immense subway footlong). And yet, be warned, dear reader, this baby will leave you staggeringly, almost sickening full. It must be something to do with the oil and mayo...and the cheese, all of which are layered on thick as can be. The veggies are fresh, however, and the bread is always adequately baked in this reviewer's experience. So too, the downtown location tends to be aptly cleaned, and there is usually a joyful employee in line to take your order on a tablet (in theory expediting service, though this never really seems to be the case). Potbelly's is, in sum, a curious and conscientious locale with heavy food ideal for hangovers, though even their veggie offerings are poised to knock you prostrate when you return to your desk post- midday satiation."}
{"text":"I have had consistently good experiences with every time I have come in to Potbelly's on green. The staff is always friendly and smiling, the dining area is clean, and my sandwich has always been out if this world. I am a frequent buyer of the Mediterranean veggie on wheat bread, and I always load it up with extra toppings and jalapeño peppers. The ingredients are fresh and the sandwich is filling. Definitely have this place on your radar for subs!"}
{"text":"Average all around, service and food. Had the chicken and cheddar which was...average. Too many sub options downtown to go back."}
{"text":"We got sandwiches and salads here when some clients were in town. The staff was quick, nice, helpful and polite.

The food was only OK in my opinion but that's just what I got - a chef salad. Everyone else was fairly pleased with their sandwiches and somehow we got an extra sandwich so I was able to taste something other than my salad.

I wouldn't return for a salad but I would for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food was great, same great food as the rest of the locations. My problem was with the guy who seemed to be the manager-he was not very friendly and was actually kind of rude. My only complaint with Potbellys besides this manager is their lack of a kids menu. I'll probably go to the Scottsdale location in the future. They were very friendly at that location."}
{"text":"I dislike their ordering system.  It is redundant and illogical.

You order a sandwich and then have to answer questions from three different people: 

1.  \"What kind of bread do you want?\"

2.  \"What sandwich did you order?\"

3.  \"What do you want on your sandwich?\"

4.  \"Is that all?  Your order comes to $x.xx\"

JUST GIVE ME A F**KING SANDWICH!!!

I should not be forced to jump through all of these hoops in order to buy a simple sandwich!

This is not a specialty or gourmet meal.  Slap some meat and cheese between two slices of bread and give it to me.

I walked out of Potbelly with a strange sense of deja vu.  Oh, that's right.  I have already been here when it was called Quiznos!

One more thing:  your Zapp's potato chips suck.

\"Hotter 'N Hot Jalapeno\" my ass.  These are the worst potato chips I have ever had.

In sum, Pobelly serves mediocre sandwiches, bad chips, and has a stupid ordering system. 

Most businesses want to stand out, whereas Potbelly just wants to be like Quiznos. 

This was my first and last time in a Potbelly restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure why this has so many bad reviews. I've been here twice and have had a good experience both times.

I always used to walk past this place in the mall but never went in. A few months ago, I tried this place out for the first time. All my food was great, and the staff was friendly. The second time, it was also good, yet the table I found was unclean and it seemed that the staff had not gotten around to busing it yet.

Good food, friendly staff, plenty of seats. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service, great food and the manager here is fantastic and customer service is his main game"}
{"text":"The store was clean, the drink area was well kept, food was great as usual! I love the location as well, I will mos def return!"}
{"text":"Another positive experience at Potbelly. We sat outside and my husband ordered me a tuna sandwich and he ordered a classic italian style sub. I am always a little hesitant ordering tuna out but was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of this sandwich. My husband really enjoyed his sub and we were pleased with the types of chips to choose from. The prices are reasonable and the portions are also good. The service is good, the restaurant is clean, and food is tasty!"}
{"text":"I loved these sandwiches in Chicago. Either Phoenicians have lower expectations or the expansion to other cities just didn't make it. The bread on my tuna salad was tasty and well toasted but that's where it ended. The tuna salad was small and boring. And could you cut pickles any thinner? The tomato soup was watery. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok sub shop. In a big sea of sub shops this place stands out because of the atmosphere and live music, but not the biggest selection for subs.  Bread is pretty good though, they have Flatbread, white and Multigrain. Not a great selection for toppings either.  They also offer milkshakes and desserts. Plenty of better sub shops nearby (Jersey mikes)  but this place is ok if you need a change because you work or live nearby. If you are just strolling through then maybe another option would be better."}
{"text":"Cool decor, nice vibe. I used to frequent when I used to live in NY and now super happy that's it's here in TO. Got my go-to sandwich, The Wreck, which was exactly how I remember it. Quality sandwich place for lunch. Great cookies. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Potbelly's is my favorite sandwich joint in terms of fast food. Deserve more than 3 stars but I am a tough critic. 

Really like the number of options you have for sandwiches. Of course, you have your classics , ham and cheese, turkey, roast beef, chicken salad, etc. but you also have different options such as mediterranean, grilled chicken, vegetarian, etc. Personally, I like their vegetarian sandwiches the best and I am a meat eater for sure! They really do not do anything special to them but the combination of the cheese, hot peppers and bread is wonderful to my pallets for some odd reason. You can get your sandwiches served toasted or just cold cuts. Lots of chip options and well as soup. Their cookies AWESOMELY huge and good when they are warm. 

State Street Potbelly's is my favorite locations. Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Amazing just kinda smaller. If you ever been to Earl of Sandwich it's very similar. A great lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"I am the hubby that was referred to below and, yes, I had the Wreck. It was a decent sandwich from a franchised sandwich shop. The decor was neat and the store was clean. The menu was a little hard to read though. The sandwich maker was friendly and helpful when I asked for recommendations. Overall, a good sandwich (better than Subway) at a good price."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped in early for lunch today. Really happy with the food and service.   I gotta say that the stinky wild eyed bum yelling at his imaginary friend coming in and out was alarming.  What is weird is you're promoting him to come in and bathe in the Soft Drink Fountain.  I really wanted a refill and you could not pay me to go near it after seeing him sticking his fingers in where the soda comes out.  Yuck Yuck Yuck"}
{"text":"Like many other transplants from the Midwest, I am so incredibly excited that Potbelly's has made it's way to Arizona! It is worth the drive downtown just to eat a little piece of \"back home\". And for those who aren't familiar with the magic that is Potbelly's, I truly think you won't be disappointed. I usually go with the Italian with extra peppers or the Chicken Salad, although I don't think I've ever tried anything I don't like. But the atmosphere is great, I've never been to a Potbelly's anywhere in Illinois (and I've been to many) that did not have the kindest and most reliable customer service. The service is fantastic, food is amazing and I even kind of  like those weird, smelly hippies they hire to play guitar on the loft. 

This is the one and only toasted sandwich shop. But the chili, chicken noodle soup and milk shakes are amazing too! Now all I need is a Noodles & Co. and FlatTop Grill!"}
{"text":"OMG so good! Get the chicken salad with hot peppers for a spicy kick. Can you please come to Ballantyne next?? Thanks! ;)"}
{"text":"Having lived in Chicago for over 20 years, Potbelly was always one of my favorites.  To this day, my frequent business trips to Chicago inevitable consists of at least one visit.  I would give the food 5 stars for most of their sandwiches.

This location, however, would do well to better train or be more selective of their employees.

Screw ups happen but not acknowledging the mistakes and compounding it further by trying to blame the computer?  Then, when I point out that the computer was apparently correct and the RECEIPT clearly shows the correct order and it was human error ... either pretending not to see it or just too ignorant to understand YOUR OWN RECEIPT?

Trying to appear magnanimous by offering to give me what I had ordered and paid for as though it was being provided as a service and for free?

It's one thing when it's just the young cashier, who may still be training, but disgusting when it's the Manager instructing this interaction.


I still love the food but will probably avoid this location for my Potbelly indulgence."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered if a man could be a God? I sure have. And until today I thought it was impossible. Then walking into Potbelly today I have irreversibly changed my mind. There was a man of stature and respect that emanated with sound from the corner. I didn't care much for the food, but the music--best I have ever heard. Ever. When I came in he was singing Scooby Doo and when he said, \"Scooby Doo bee doo, where are you?\" It felt as if he was directly as me as if I was Scooby and whether I'm where I want to be in life. This man single handedly changed my life. Honestly, I have no idea where I'd be right now if I didn't walk into that Potbelly half n hour ago. I digress, but because of this Pablo Picasso of guitar seduced my ear all of my facebook friends will know of the weight this man carries. And it is immense.  My friends list is extensive too. I have nearly 31 friends. I say nearly because my girlfriend isn't sure she wants to make it public. And in case you're questioning whether she's real. She is. And she's beautiful. I met her online and her name is Shirly Aman. Also I have 200 friend requests pending and I'm sure when they log on they'll accept. Although it does seem odd they've been posting and adding people since I've added them, but once that gets sorted out Potbelly will have a heap of new customers. A big ol' handful of customers. A dump-truck of customers all because of this God like guitarist."}
{"text":"New favorite sandwich shop! Love their Italian sandwich, and cheddar and broccoli soup is awesome. Fresh food and fast, friendly service. They also have delicious shakes, smoothies, and make homemade ice cream sandwiches where you choose your fav. cookies."}
{"text":"Good subs.  Good salads.   Good prices.   Good service.   I like that the nutritional information is easily visible."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich I've had in a long time! I'm so glad I found Potbelly! And they have a drive thru! All high quality ingredients. The bacon and pickles are the best. They have my favorite Zapp's potato chips too. I will definitely be back. Friendly staff was helpful with walking me through the menu."}
{"text":"Ok \"Steve\"...I'm a little suspicious of one star reviews when it looks as if this person has just opened an account and has little to NO history of writing reviews.....

I am a fan of Potbelly - a regular stop when in D.C. For work, was excited when one popped up downtown and am elated there is one closer to the East side!

Picked up a to go order the other day, many employees, many are likely training and all had a FABULOUS attitude! 

Got home 20 minutes later and our sandwiches were warm and the bread was not compromised by the oil we asked to be added, chewy delicious bread, quality ingredients and amazing service - typical and expected of Potbelly! 

I will be frequenting this shop and picked up a catering menu for my company's lunches....

Whenever I see \"questionable\" reviews - it only feeds my fire to support businesses - so keep it coming \"Steve\" - potbelly will succeed -primarily because you don't want it to! ;)"}
{"text":"Inexpensive sandwiches freshly prepared for you. The options are pretty basic, with your standard meats such as turkey and roast beef, with all the toppings you'd normally find in a sandwich (e.g., Onions, lettuce, tomato). They do have a nicely piquant spicy pepper topping, which packs a punch! Like others have mentioned, it's kind of like a step up from Jimmy John's, in that the ingredients are better, with bigger portions, but it's not a sandwich I'll necessarily crave.

One plus here is that they sell Zapp's chips, for those that want kettle cooked spicy goodness!"}
{"text":"First time to try a pot belly Sammie and holy shit are they good. Got A Wreck with peppers lettuce, tomato and the fixins. Those peppers got nice heat but not overpowering to ruin the Sammie. Definitely get the peppers on the Sammie. Slaw was good too. Solid sandwich!!"}
{"text":"This place it great. love the bread they use and its just delicious."}
{"text":"When I walked in I really liked the aesthetics of the place, seemed like a pretty good place to do homework. I've been there a few times, I got their Italian once and the turkey pesto. Pretty good, Italian was delicious but I thought the turkey was a little dry and too thick for a sandwich. A little pricey compared to some others sandwich shops in the area like Hangover Hoagie's. if you want a sandwich near ASU I'd probably go to Hangover Hoagies because they have bigger portions and it honestly tastes better, for a more affordable price. But if you need some place to eat and do homework, this is a great place for you. Right next to ASU and attached to a Starbucks."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here and went through the drive thru.  I've seen these restaurants around but this was the first time I've eaten at one.  I ordered the Italian sandwich and it was delicious.  I didn't know that the sandwich was hot when I ordered it but that just made it even better.  I ordered the regular size and it was just a little bit too much for me to finish so my husband finished it for me.  I'm sure we'll definitely be stopping back in here again."}
{"text":"Pot Belly sandwich!  The restaurant floors and tables were clean.  I ordered the pizza Sandwich on whole grain with bacon on the suggestion of the very friendly sandwich maker. She stated it was the way to go on the sandwich and she was right. 

However, she was weak on the meat slicer. The sandwich was excellent, bread was soft and the sandwich overall was good.  Two sandwiches two drinks and two chips, total damage $23.34. Not the best sandwiches, but good enough to earn four stars.  They need to add more meat on their sandwiches to earn 5 stars for the price."}
{"text":"Potbelly has become my new go-to sandwich spot, and I eat sandwiches A LOT.  The breads, meats and cheeses are of good quality and I like their choices of sides-- I recommend the macaroni salad! Service is also great. 
My one criticism is their application of condiments. If you don't ask for extra mayo and mustard, they really skimp on it and you get a hella dry-ass sandwich. I don't believe there are any condiment packets available in the dining area so you have to rely on the crew members. And if you do ask for extra mayo and mustard, they absolutely DRENCH the sub. Like no joke, you unwrap it and it's literally dripping. There's a middle ground guys lol! But oh well not a huge problem right? Overall I do recommend Potbelly."}
{"text":"I work uptown so potbellys is convenient for lunch.  I went at 11:30.  I got through the line quickly and ordered the ham and cheddar.  It was good and around $8 for chips and a sub.  This is a good addition for uptown.  The lines get insane after 12 but you can order online to skip the wait."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place ....ABSOLUTELY!
I love their Italian sandwich......also their meatball one....they know how to make it delish without making it soggy with the sauce.
I think their store on state st is pretty cool...love sitting there and chatting with the wife."}
{"text":"I got the pizza sandwich with extra sauce, it was awesome. Affordable for the value--tasted way better than subway. The staff was really really nice, and they created a great atmosphere. 5Star!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places I've ever been to. If you're hungry be sure to go with the larger sandwich option, it's not that big at all. The addition of avocados is a must with the Grilled Chicken and Cheddar sandwich. The peppers add a nice zesty taste to the sandwich as well. 

Being from the west coast haven't ever come across Potbelly but if I ever travel east again it'll be a must-eat spot."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop!  Living next door and not wanting to walk a block to Subway, we decided to give it a whirl.  Wasn't quite too sure at first after Googling their menu and not seeing a huge selection but we were wrong.  They have a good selection of more basic-type subs but they are delicious.  I had the meatball with onions and Italian seasoning and it was great.  They toast them all and it was nice to not have such a huge mass of crunchy bread like you get at a Subway.  It felt healthier for some reason and fresher.  They also sell fresh baked cookies, brownies and shakes and malts.  

Definitely a nice change from the average sandwich shops and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"i cant tell you all how great this place is.. seriously. i grew up in DC and this place is everywhere and rightfully so! the atmosphere is fun, QUICK, and puts all to rest. I hope its the same and when is TEMPE getting one? PLEASE!!!!1"}
{"text":"So happy that this gem made it to Arizona! I stopped in on my way home to pick up lunch yesterday afternoon. There is a bit of construction going on on Rural but it didn't obstruct from turning into the lot they share with Starbucks. It'd been awhile, so I checked out the menu for a bit and decided to get the wreck and an oreo shake. I couldn't wait to get home and dig in. The sandwich isn't a footlong (maybe 6-8''?), but they jam so much tasty into it. And the shake was perfectly crafted - not too thick so I was able to enjoy immediately, but not too watery either."}
{"text":"Best sammiches I ever had. My number sammich shop followed by Firehouse Subs. I would approve them to anybody anytime."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we loved it! First and foremost the service was exceptional.  The young gentleman who helped us choose our meal and made the sandwiches was so nice and just had the best personality.  The sandwiches are warmed and come out toasty.  I had the turkey and what set it apart from an ordinary sandwich was the giardina mix (spicy pickled veggies).  We also got the cookie ice cream sandwich.  Two fresh baked cookies with your choice of ice cream in the middle.  So sinfully good.  This is a very affordable, different take on your average sandwich shop.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was waiting here for 10 minutes and the guy was in the back texting on his phone. I had to walk in the  back and grabbed someone to help me out. 

There were couple other people who walked out because no one was available."}
{"text":"I am not sure what there is to say as I have been a fan since around '89; when I stepped foot in the original location in Lincoln Park (Chicago,IL) just outside of my DePaul campus.
My daughter had one of her first sandwiches as a toddler(Turkey) from the Clybourn Location and I just picked another one up on the way to her ASU dorm about 17 years later.  We also shared a weekly trip to another location while she was in pre-k. up until they opened one in our town.

There is no one better than Potbelly's at toasted subs!  They have fooled around with the menu and added multiple options.  Original owners sold out and now the chain has expanded throughout the US; yet they still deliver a consistently solid product.  Great Work!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on the way to work. The service was hilariously slow. The workers had no sense of urgency and seemed to feel like they were there to chat.  The breakfast sandwich was brutal - Egg was disgusting & bagel was soggy. I never write yelp reviews but was so annoyed by this place."}
{"text":"I have driven by this PotBelly  hundreds of times and have seen them popping up in quite a few places lately.  I have always had the intention to stop in.  Well, I was finally able to do so.  

When you walk in the first thing you notice is the funky décor.  Made to look like an older restaurant, I almost think they tried a little to hard, and don't really see how it ties in to the food they sell.  But thats just my own little opinion and does not contribute to my star count  or return factor!

They have a large selection of sandwiches that are all put through the oven and a soup of the day.  The sandwiches are good, but are very small.  I found myself leaving hungry.  I'm sure I will stop in again sometime but only of I'm looking for a quick snack as for me this was not a meal.

Return factor-70%"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. I had a salad.... With a ridiculously small amount of chicken and moldy cherry tomatoes.  I won't be back ."}
{"text":"An easy go-to lunch and sandwich place. They've got decent prices but the service there has always been top notch to me. They'll accommodate nearly anything you can ask for. Sure, some of the items are extra, but otherwise, you can customize your choice of hot subs and they have pretty good cookies too. I typically order from their app so I don't have to wait in the insane lunch line during the week and they offer decent perks from there too!"}
{"text":"A step above both Quizno's and Subway, Potbelly Sandwich Works provided me a very delicious Grilled Chicken and Cheddar Sandwich for lunch recently!  

I ordered it on a regular bread (which was plenty!) and chose to have everything added (e.g., lettuce, tomatoes, etc.). No dressing though! 

Paired it with a glass of water, and it turned out to be an excellent lunch! Next time, I look forward to trying a sandwich on the Skinny bread, which apparently has a  fewer amount of calories compared to the Regular Bread."}
{"text":"I passed this place by chance on my way to a blood test at the Life Labs just down the street and it caught my eye. I had never seen the place before so it had to be new. (I realize there is a south location but I'm rarely down there). 

I decided to stop by for lunch on my way back. The place was a mad house (in a good way). People all over the place, a ukulele player in the corner (Thumbs up on that!). I felt they really had a process of managing what was clearly an overflow than what they had expected. 

I grabbed the Bigs Italian (with a few substitutions), a side of coleslaw and the milkshake (Vanilla). It was completely worth all of it. The only thing was that I didn't know how hot that hot peppers were, I'll try to dial it down next time. 

This place gets a thumbs up from me and is TOTALLY worth the walk from Yonge to get to."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches and this place is delish! The bread is warm and soft. I got a Turkey and provolone sandwich and it was warm and yummy. We got a pickle on the side and it was huge! Topped it off with a oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. Great lunch. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us a lesson on their history. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried their new Gyro flatbread sandwich. It would have been good if there was MORE tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, feta, and red onion!! There was basically none. It was all meat and dry."}
{"text":"Very good, live music too. Wish this place existed when I was in grad school... Welcomed addition."}
{"text":"Well I walked in with my wife. No place to sit and they had some guy singing and playing music in the corner so sound we could not talk so we left and went next door."}
{"text":"There are two reasons I decided I live too far from Potbelly to get take-out again.

1. The ambience is really nice -- low-key, lots of wood, free wi-fi, cheerful customer service -- so it seems a shame not to enjoy it. I sense that eating here would soothe nerves shattered by particularly lively shopping sprees at Nordstrom Rack.

2. My sandwich smelled so good that I had to resist unwrapping it and eating it in the car. Repeatedly.

This is not your heaped-with-meat New York deli-style sandwich: those are usually at the $8-and-up price point rather than $5 price point. That said, the meat is much better quality than what Subway offers: the taste says \"oh, hai Martha Stewart!\" rather than \"cheap lunch.\"

So this place has great potential as an economical yet gracious spot for lunch."}
{"text":"My reaction to Potbelly is always \"so small,\" followed swiftly by \"so good!\" If you're looking for a direct Subway substitute, Potbelly will come across as pricey. If you're looking for an alternative to chi-chi $8-$10 sandwiches, Potbelly uses highly respectable ingredients and has a wheat roll that toasts up delicious.

The Wreck is a truly fine sandwich, nicely filled and tasting like cold cuts I would not be embarrassed to buy at the supermarket.

The environment is also a bit more soothing than many sub shops: it's all earth-tones and wooden chairs, so there's a sense of relaxing.

The clerks are cheerful even under the pressures of customers with truly peculiar orders."}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here on Sunday night at dinnertime, which must not be a popular time of day to go to a sandwich shop because we were the only ones in there. But when I opened the door, I thought, \"oh wow, what a cute little place!\" Kudos for decorations and a fun theme. I had to strain my neck to see the menu, which was way up high on the wall. I appreciated how I could get \"thin\" bread, where they slice some of it off so there is 1/3 less. I got the Mediterranean with no cheese and added chicken. It was stuffed well with peppers, artichokes and the likes. The prices were very fair for what you got. I don't know if its the most awesome sandwich I've ever eaten, but I would definitely go back. I tried my husband's Wreck and thought it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"The people in here are really nice, I went there for cookies but they are ran out and we told them we drove all the way from Los Angeles, then one person i think she is a manager(long hair lady) she gave us free bag of mini chocolate cookies. They impressed us. So far I met a lot of nice people in Phenix, I started loving this town now :)

Thank you so much"}
{"text":"I went with the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich. I think the sandwich wasn't too bad! Probably better than Subway. They could put more ingredients in the sandwich which would increase the star rating. They told me they also sell peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in case you're having a crave! I'll have to explore the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"My friend and I went awhile back to Potbelly's Sandwich shop. When we arrived we were welcomed by the man and woman working there. The lady explained how it worked.. you simply pick your sandwich and then whatever condiments you want on it. Potbelly is like a very fancy and more delicious subway. They also make their own brownie cookies and malt shakes. I really enjoyed my Chicken/cheddar  sandwhich, my friend got the tuna and she said it was very good. We have returned 3 times since then. It is a little spendy but well worth it. My 6 in and shake was about $10."}
{"text":"I ordered an Italian.  There was almost no meat on this sandwich and I had to search for evidence of what little cheese there was.  Pathetic.  I felt like they were selling me a piece of dry bread.  All the tables in the restaurant were covered in crumbs and droppings of  mayonnaise and lettuce.  This, during a slow time in the day.  I left feeling like I gave them my money and received little to no value in return."}
{"text":"This place is OK for a quick sandwich. I heard that Potbelly was a big deal here in the Midwest so I decided to give it a shot. It was OK, good service, decent sandwiches, but nothing to write home about.

They have a nice patio that you can sit and enjoy your food on during the afternoon. A cute place to sit and chit chat with friends.

I got a tuna flatbread sandwich and it was OK. It wasn't really good or bad. I was happy that they had a flatbread option to make it a bit healthier. But the tuna was very meh. I think I prefer other places more. I will however say that I like this place better than Subway.

I also wanted to try the tomato soup and ordered it, and when I got home and opened it I realized it was actually potato and bacon soup. I was not happy but I didn't feel like walking all the way back to the place. It wasn't good at all.

3/5"}
{"text":"Favorite sub shop currently! All the sibs here are amazing as are the salads/soups! The dream bar is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"It's arrived! It's arriiiived!!!!!!

Moved from NY and didn't leave the house for a whole week after I learned there were no Potbellys in Charlotte. Now, with opening of Uptown location I can finally go out again.

Utterly delicious. Priced great. Quick and friendly. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Finding a decent local sandwich shop that doesn't have the same boring choices and disinterested staff is hard to find in this area of town.  I didn't know what to expect when I first went to Potbelly.  I was VERY happy they had online ordering, that is always a plus in my book.  The online menu was complete and allowed customizations to meet your palate.  They have a good selection of sandwiches, on a variety of breads, even a thin whole wheat if you are watching carbs.  They have an excellent selection of salads and soups.  And their deserts - decadent!  I have had a couple different salads, they usually last for two meals for me.  I have had 3-4 different sandwiches and the little bag of cookies - those are my snacks for several days. 

The staff here is friendly, helpful and conversant.  If they get something wrong they are quick to fix it or replace something out of stock.  They didn't have any small cookies one time so they gave me two big cookies for free.  They know how to take care of customers."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches with cool ambience. Downtown Charlotte is a great setting and the sandwiches are first rate. The meatball on flat bread is the best meatball sandwich I've ever had (and my 11 year old son endorses this message!)"}
{"text":"I know it's probably un-healthy, but I think their sandwiches are pretty delicious. The sandwich hits the spot quit well especially when you're starving for a late lunch around 2pm. What I love are the extra stuff they put on your order (of course they're optional, but I put everything on - I can't do without pickles and jalepeno pepper). I really enjoyed the veggie mushroom sandwich, but i got turned off just a bit when I realized how greasy it looked with the melted cheese .... . 

The service is quick. The staff are very friendly. And as everyone mentions, the price is awesome (especially for students)."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this particular Potbelly. Everything is done right. Let's start with the staff and service. Lunch rush is handled with haste, they really try and get everyone through the line quickly. I have been eating here about once a week for a year and they already have my order down and recognize my tastes in toppings. Instead of forced corporate friendliness, you get a genuine positive attitude and conversation.

Back to the toppings. Their \"hot peppers\" (see giardiniera) are a total game changer. No sandwich shop can touch this condiment. Maybe it's because I grew up in Chicago that I have such a craving for this pickled spicy and crunchy concoction, but every sandwich I order gets heaping spoonfuls of this goodness. It comes in around a 7/10 on the heat scale; you will sweat under your eyes from the steady burn.

Meats and cheese are high end and generally lean. At some competitors the meats blend together, everything has a processed salty taste. Here if you order a multiple meat sandwich you can differentiate the flavors for each meat. Sandwiches are available in 2 sizes, regular and big. Get the Bigs unless you are with the 12 and under crowd. Maybe they can introduce a XL footlong option in the future for my monster apatite. Instead of the chips, get the high end pickle spears! They are priced right at $1. Sandwich prices range from 5-$7 I never leave over $10 so the value proposition is strong. No shenanigans like at firehouse with $10 large sandwiches.

This sandwich shop is so good, when my lease expires I will factor in total distance from potbelly in my calculations."}
{"text":"Good consistent quality food.  Great atmosphere especially the staff. The manager is so friendly and gregarious.  He really goes the extra mile."}
{"text":"Potbelly's are popping up more and more around the valley so I was destined to stop into one eventually 
Today was the day!
The girls that work at this location are all so very nice and helpful 
The decor is cute and very historical, a ton of it consists of ASU/Tempe/Phoenix information and landmarks... Fun to read or look and eat... 
The signs make it easy to navigate where to start your order and so forth...
The huge menu on the wall is very clear and thorough...
The sandwich options are pretty extensive 
Today I went for \"The Wreck\" and I dressed it with pretty much every topping except mustard... It consisted of Ham, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey, and Swiss cheese! Also the sandwich was toasted, not sure if that is how each one is prepared but it was good and I didn't mind :)
I had my sanny with jalapeño chips and it was a very good lunch...
Glad I stopped in and I will return
I agree with everyone in saying that it is a better sandwich option compared to subway and Jimmy johns... Decent price too"}
{"text":"I drove by today and to check it out,and I am glad I did. This place is family friendly and the sandwiches speak for themselves, they are a step above Jimmy J.'s. I had the Italian and it was Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  Staff was very friendly and courteous.  Prices are reasonable - not as cheap as subway but quality much better.  I ordered the club sandwich on whole wheat bread.  I was impressed that the turkey was from a real turkey breast, not salty lunch meat.  The bacon was crisp and lettuce and tomatoes were fresh.  Will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Second to last time I went here I ordered the uptown salad online. Picked it up, got back to work and realized they had given me a farmhouse salad- and I do NOT like hard boiled eggs. 

Last time I went here (11/3/15), they gave me the right salad..,and it was horrible. There was hardly any toppings on my wilted lettuce. My boyfriend got a sandwich that he didn't care for, and the chick pea salad he got for later didn't even have chick peas on it!!!!

Won't be back here for a VERY long time....come on guys, get it right...."}
{"text":"Hmm, this one is tough because I really would like to love this place. It's not bad, however it's very Quizno'esq... Not a real word... I know... but if you ever ate at Quiznos you would see the resemblance. The sandwich was good, I had the chicken sandwich add bacon and a cup of broccoli cheddar. Neither was spectacular but it was good enough. This places biggest problem is that there are amazing sandwich shops in the down town area, what this place perceives as... others achieves as. If that makes sense. Long story short, good enough but I'll hit the other local fresh shops."}
{"text":"Ordered the Big Italian sub! It was very good! Bread was toasted very well. The meats with the Italian were very good. The toppings I included were lettuce, onion, tomato, hot peppers (my favorite) and light mayo. Very pleased with my sandwich and only at 7.20 for the big size for the Italian it definitely stuffed me. Would definitely come back whenever I'm feeling for a sub!"}
{"text":"Potbelly sandwich might be my new favorite sandwich chain. I like the store decor, friendly service and excellent sandwiches. I've had a few different types of sandwiches but anything with turkey In it is always good. They also have soups and other side items. Hoping they will make it out to California soon."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. The customer service I received the other was awesome and they have some great alternatives to sandwiches (chicken salad salad)"}
{"text":"Went in around lunch time they werent as busy as smashbuger and I was short on time so it worked. Never being here before I had a couple questions and the girls working ran off all options as quick as she could rushing threw everyone in line. The workers seemed pushy. Food was okay, good sandwich just not great. A little pricey I feel for what you get. My friend did not like their mushroom sandwich at all but salad was good. Don't think Ill be back with Captain Bills just down the street"}
{"text":"This place is really good, they have amazing food but the only downside to them is when they messed up my order and that I had to wait for more than 30 minutes to get my food. Otherwise I highly recommend it. My favorite is the meatballs sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and really enjoyed it. Both times ordered the Tuna Salad sandwich on thin cut bread. Very tasty and plenty of tuna. Very clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Skinny Pair which was the T-K-Y sandwich on wheat & the side Loaded Baked Potato soup. That Baked potato soup was THE BOMB! I wish I had ordered a bowl! Now I know! I like that you can customize your sandwich and it's made fresh. I also like that they have a nutrition calculator on their website so you can log your calories/macros in your fitness app. There was a live musician playing his guitar inside the sandwich shop and I went on my lunch break! I thought that was a little weird but didn't bother me at all. Overall, good experience. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious with yummy ingredients. Its an easy location to reach when getting off I-10. I would've given 4 stars, but the staff working were not very pleasant when taking our order. Despite this, I said thank you at the end of the transaction (which I believe staff should say on their own with all customers), and she just silently turned the other way"}
{"text":"While waiting for my flight at gate c-29 all I can hear is one employee who talks so loud, she can be heard all through the terminal. It's very disturbing and someone really needs to address it!  Sometimes it's more than food that can make or break a place!"}
{"text":"I tried Potbelly's for the first time today. I tried the chicken salad and it was really good. I have never had a toasted sandwich with chicken salad before but it made a real believer out of me. I also liked the sandwich was a good size not too big and priced just right for what I got. Service was good and Kayla was especially helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Potbelly subs.  The first time I ever ate at one was in Chicago many years ago, and I fell in love with them right then and there. Eventually, they opened a few in Michigan, and I would eat there when I could.  

Fast forward a few years, and now I live in Phoenix. Not a potbelly in sight, so I ate at other sub shops. Now don't get me wrong, Phoenix does have a good selection of sub places to eat at, and I am a fan of a few local places out here. But, when I heard that they were opening a Potbellies, I could not have been any more excited! FINALLY!

So this place opened last week, and the foot traffic in and out of this place has been tremendous!  Move over other sub shops, this place is here to stay. Potbelly's makes a hell of a sub, and I, along with many others, are dedicated fans of this place. I went on the second day they opened, and got me a roast beef sub. Today? I got the stack without the ham.

Potbelly's has a great menu selection to choose from, with extremely wonderful prices.  They also list the calorie count for you right on the menu, so you know just how healthy (or unhealthy) the sub will be.  They even have a vegetarian sub for all you non meat eaters! Also they have great deserts here, all fresh baked. Cookies and brownies freshly made, along with smoothies and shakes as well.  These are some serious people here folks!

The menu here is ample, with plenty to choose from, but it's not as big as I remember it from the Chicago and Detroit locations.  The gal told me that they have a limited menu now since they just opened, and will be adding on in the future with the rest of the items that they normally offer.

Service here is surprisingly efficient, with plenty of staff to help you out. The line may be long, but it moves quickly, so don't be intimidated when you arrive.  I'm in and out in 5 minutes!  They have plenty of seating indoors and out, but if you come during lunch hour like I do, you might have a problem finding a seat. Since I work right here, I just take the sub back with me to my desk and eat.

Go eat some Potbellies. Best subs around, and you'll be a fan of this place in no time!"}
{"text":"This is my second time there, and not my last! A good friend turned me on to it and i love it! Im not a big sandwhich eater, dont care for subway or any of that but love this place!"}
{"text":"I love the chickpea salad here. Or the 'chicken salad' salad. The wreck is pretty darn tasty too! Shakes are the extra bonus to your meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch while in Cleveland for work training.  For a place that I saw and decided to stop at - very good.  I had decided on a salad, but when I went up to order, the employee convinced me to order the Chicken Mediterranean Sandwich, which I did not regret.  Fresh chicken, hummus, feta, artichoke, cucumber - really good.  The atmosphere was also nice in this restaurant.  I was surprised to see a performer playing an acoustic guitar in here on a random Thursday at lunch time.  Also, several books to read if you have time to stay for a while.  Good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Potbelly's is a good place for a quick bite. Their sandwiches are very reasonably priced and they are rather tasty. If you're in somewhat of a hurry and want something good, try Potbelly's!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great options. You must look into their \"underground menu\" for some really awesome sandwiches."}
{"text":"Potbelly has always been an old time favorite from back in college, although, it's a great sandwich anytime! There are plenty of options available, made fresh right in front of you, and served up fresh and delicious. 

This location hits all the checkpoints - it's clean, friendly, and the service is quick. If you're interested in a milkshake - this place serves them up fresh."}
{"text":"Potbelly Sandwich is pretty good. I have no complaints but i'd also say it is nothing terribly special. To me, it is a step up from your typical Subway (which I also enjoy) but it is a different type of sandwich. 

I got the chicken and cheddar sandwich, hot with pretty much all the toppings. It was pretty delicious. Nothing to write home about but I've came here before in the past and I wouldn't be against coming back again. There are more well crafted sandwich options to choose from and many toppings to add. 

I did not get a shake this time but have in the past and they are pretty delicious just as they advertise."}
{"text":"As Janet K. mentioned, Potbelly is set at the far end of the West Towne mall at the edge of the food court,  making the environment much less rowdy than the main seating area.  It's convenient because you can enter from the parking lot or the food court, and with the outer door and the occasional breeze,  it doesn't feel quite as claustrophobic.  

My mom and I both ordered a Skinny Pair, which is a \"Skinny\" sandwich + side of soup for $6.60 (quite a deal).  My combination: a mushroom melt + spicy southwest veggie soup.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted with fresh mushrooms - filling, but leaving just enough room for dessert (or a Butter Rum Mocha in my case). Not too much flair. Not too much oomph. The spicy southwest veggie soup reminded me of the corn chowder from the SF Soup Company back at home - creamy and chock-full of corn kernels with just a hint of spicy - so that was a definite plus for me. 

If you are a fan of super stuffed sandwiches drenched in sauces, this is probably not the sandwich place for you. On the other hand,  if you are just looking for a hearty, wholesome meal, give this place a try. All in all, a great place to stop for lunch or a quick dinner. Potbelly me up! :9

PS.  I've heard that the Potbelly oatmeal cookies are to-die-for, so I will be back to give them a try!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is open and clean. Not sure what the theme is but it's nice. They specialize obviously in sandwiches toasted. The bread is really yummy the rest is kinda flat and bland. Each party in our group said the same. Very little meat. Nothing awesome about this place. Not horrible either. They validate parking."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches for unadventurous lunchgoers. 

Anyone in search of something unique or special, beware! 

The bread is boring. Unique in its corn meal finish and density, but still boring. If my Italian sub was any indication, anything you order will taste like mostly bread. 

Prices aren't bad though."}
{"text":"Very ordinary food joint. Nothing really special about their sandwich. Ordered their special. Nothing surprising. But I have to say their ingredients was fresh. Worst part was their ice tea. Arizona people are crazy for the ice tea but I find the ice tea were blend and tasteless. I would rather brew a pot of tea myself."}
{"text":"First timer for lunch today. I told the sandwich maker that so he recommended the Italian.  I obliged and was not disappointed. Impressive , clean store. Great service. Only a couple miles from work,  so will be returning often.."}
{"text":"Potbelly in downtown Phoenix was recommended by a colleague who'd eaten there in other cities. I stopped by here when rushing between meetings to get a new passport snap, and needed also to grab lunch while out. The employees were super helpful and quick to prepare my sandwich; in fact, one employee was working the line with a wireless \"order-taker.\"  

You first choose your sandwich and bread, then move on to the assembly line of workers who pile on your extras like mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, oil 'n' vinegar, Italian seasonings, onions, etc. Chips and sodas are available, and a few sweet treats. It also appeared that they make shakes. 

The menu seemed a bit sparse. The sandwich was delicious, but the menu, as compared to a Firehouse or Subway, seemed quite a bit smaller. I was glad they listed the calories, though -- good for a chick watching her figure!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic shop, with delicious sandwiches and awesome breakfast sandwiches as well ! The tall, bearded gentleman who served me was an absolute riot to be around, and was very cheerful and made the experience worth repeating. Awesome staff and even better food.

Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend go to potbelly to see what all the hype is about when I ask the lady that it was my first time and what will you recommend from the sandwiches she said , \"any of them \" with a blunt way & didn't care . I ended up getting a salad since lack of information really . While I am eating another customer comes in a little more dressed up than me and asks her same question as I did and this girl goes off she explains to the woman what bread goes better with the sandwiches and try this sauce and that one is the most popular .. And I am like for reals !!!! She couldn't have done that for me .. Any who not coming back to this location ."}
{"text":"It's OK.

The good:
- Nice location (glad to have something at Town & Country)
- The parking was fine
- The service was great
- Prices are cheap
- Chocolate milkshake was really good

The bad:
- The Wreck
- Sandwiches had hardly any meat and hardly any toppings
- If you like a sandwich that is mostly bread then this is for you

On the cheap, I'd rather go to Subway.  Ho hum, at least at Subway I get my lettuce and tomatoes."}
{"text":"A nice little corner sandwich shop. Customize a sammie or design your own. Plus, they have good deals like $6 combo lunches, small sandwich and a cup of soup. Not bad!

We ordered a turkey and cheese skinny, roast beef skinny, tomato soup and a cup of broccoli and cheese. The sandwiches were a great size to be considered a skinny. it really helped satisfy our afternoon hunger. It came with these hot peppers that they marinade in olive oil. The oil part was a little over done but they were perfectly spicy and tangy. The hubby added some with peppers to his tomato soup which was AMAZING!!! The best tomato soup i've ever had, with small chunks of veggies in them. I wish my broccoli and cheese could have been better though. It lacked the delicious cheesy flavor that I was expecting, like the one I had at Panera bread.

The restaurant had a nice view of the inner city streets, buses, hotels, busy intersections so it was nice to view the city while we ate. The service was pleasant nothing over the top but just good pleasant workers."}
{"text":"This place is crap. 10 bucks for a shit sandwich. What a rip off.  Half of the toppings weren't even in the sandwich. Looks like he just threw everything on the paper and wrapped it up. Garbage."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have great sandwiches and great salads! The service is awesome and the food is delicious. The food is also large portions and will fill you up and you might even have left overs! The cookies are also delicious! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have to give them two stars for having a clean and good looking shop. I was at the FedEx-Kinko's and my original plan was to choose Chipotle down the strip or DiBella's across the street to pick up lunch when I was done. But then I saw a sign for Potbelly's. I'd heard of them when I was in DC but had never tried one. So, I thought I'd give it a shot. 

I got a reg. meatball on white and a tuna salad on white. The woman who waited on me was multi-tasking and not giving me her full attention so I had to order twice. When I started telling her what I wanted on the tuna she said \"you order that at mumble mumble.\" She indicated over towards the register. So I moved down there and immediately the young guy at the register asked what I'd ordered. I told him and said \"am I supposed to order the tuna here?\" He said yeah, in a minute.  Then I realized the reason the counter got so high between the skinny little order space and the skinny checkout was the oven between the two. To my surprise I saw my tuna sandwich coming down the chain conveyor.  Wait! I hadn't given my order yet! And I didn't realize they toasted all their sandwiches! I like onions on my tuna and if it's toasted I want them under the cheese, but remember, when I started to order she told me to move down the line to order. I thought she meant to order the sandwich, not just stuff after it's toasted. So unexpectedly here comes my sandwich, with Swiss cheese melted on it. I am not a fan of Swiss cheese. I had been prepared to substitute provolone for the cheese. But, again, I had no idea she hade made me a tuna sub with Swiss cheese and sent it through the oven. 

So the next thing I see is the register guy step to his left and ask me what I want on my sandwiches. First, the meatball -do I want Italian seasoning? I figured there already was seasoning in the meatballs and sauce but, what the heck. Yeah, I'll take the seasoning. Then the tuna. Onions, mayo, seasoning and balsamic vinagrette. All items I would have asked them to put on BEFORE the cheese and BEFORE the sandwich was heated, but hadn't had the opportunity. I thought, well, next time i'll know better.

So the guy turns back into register guy and tells me the total. It sounded a little low so I said \"Did you get these?\" and indicated the bottle of soda and the bag of chips I had in my hands, right in front of him.  \"uh, no.\"  

I leave and already \"have a bad taste in my mouth\" figuratively speaking. But I was hungry and trying to decide which sandwich would be lunch and which, dinner. I decided, since they were both toasted, it didn't matter.

Oh, and I had ordered a chocolate malted shake, too. It came in a plastic cup with the straw already in it. The straw, naturally, still had the paper on the drinking end, and there were two little cookies they slide down the straw to the lid. Cute, right? 
When I get to the car I pull the paper off the straw. As I drive away I go for a sip. Nothing but air. The straw has a hole in it. I look and realize they must have bent it jamming it through the lid! Fortunately I had a straw in the car and switched them. That was better. So the \"special, hand-made shake\" was meh. Not very chocolatey and kinda light in color makes me think they used vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup - no chocolate ice cream. And I got barely a hint of malt. Just enough to know that yeah, it was a chocolate malt I ordered, but not the one I expected. But it wasn't bad. I drank it and kind of liked it. I mean, I didn't NOT like it.

So I get home and settle down. Tuna in fridge, meatball on plate. Cold Coke from Mexico in a glass bottle I got with a to-go dinner from El Tolteca last night, along with a glass of ice. (The Pepsi I got at Potbelly's I save for supper.) Unwrap the sandwich. Oh. It's kinda wrinkly looking, but otherwise looks like a meatball sub. Take a bite. Oh, the bread is kinda chewy, and doesn't feel toasted at all. I never did see it come through the toaster so maybe they figure the heat from the sauce melts the cheese, so no reason to toast it. So the bun is a negative. Chewy and bland, no crunch like you usually get in an oven baked sub. The meatballs and sauce were also surprisingly bland.  I really wasn't getting any flavor. So I took a swig of my Mexican Coke and it was packed with flavor! Like Coke used to be! It was more than just the fact they use real sugar. This was just good! But it wasn't from Potbelly's, so they don't get credit for it. I finish off half the bland meatball sub and wrap the rest for later. I know the bread will crisp up when I reheat it, and I'll add some more sauce with seasoning on it. Hopefully it will taste better.

So I'm sticking with two stars for the cleanliness and decor. No more stars for blah service and bland food. I may re-review after I eat the tuna tonight."}
{"text":"Convenient location on the north side of Bloor near Avenue Rd. Lots of seating. There's a good menu of sandwichs and salads, as well as drinks. The restaurant is clean and staff are obliging. Food is ok but the buffalo chicken sandwich had very little spicy sauce on it. In general I enjoyed lunch here but nothing was particularly special."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a few months and always wanted to try this sandwich place. Finally the day has come. 

Walked in and there seems to always be a line but it goes really fast. The service is very friendly and smiling which makes your visit even more enjoyable. The place is clean, very inviting and just the atmosphere encourages you to eat there. 

I had the roast beef sandwiches which had lots of meat and toasted. What a toasted goodness. The only problem is that its a small sandwich but its so good. My kids had the wreck and inhaled it. They also had the broccoli cheddar soup which was also very good. 

I really enjoyed this place and can't wait til they add the big sandwiches to their menu but in the meantime I got to try their other sandwiches. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Delish! Love the turkey club flat. Good bacon and the flat is toasted. The chicken cheddar flat is delicious also. But the ice cream cookie is amazing! You pick the cookies and they hand make it for you. Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I came in today and was very disappointed in the salad I received.   I ordered the chicken salad salad, which I always order with no tomatoes. When they handed over my salad, not only could I see tomatoes in it, but I couldn't see any cheese. So, I asked the guy who handed over the salad if it had cheese in it and he looked me in the eye and told me that he mixed it in.   I didn't say anything about the tomatoes because I didn't want to sound like a grumpy customer and I knew they were easy to pick out. When I got home, I looked all through my salad and there was no cheese mixed in at all. I can't believe that guy looked me in the eye and lied so blatantly.   Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"A step above Jimmy Johns and 2x as good as Subway

The Wreck with everything is my Go-To order but their other options like the Pizza Sub is pretty decent as well.

Only wish is that they were a bit cheaper or offered a bigger portion"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chicago lunch spots has landed in Toronto!
A great alternative to Subway, Potbelly's offers tasty sandwiches for a decent price.  
The staff were great and the interior of the shop is warm and inviting.  Lots of historic pictures and posters of Toronto.  The old seating map of Exhibition Stadium was classic!
And, unlike the locations I've been to in Chicago, the Toronto store sells beer!
A good addition to the lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"We were out of town and I had a sandwich craving so this place came up with good reviews and was very near our hotel. I went in nice clean cool(temp and decor) place they have a pretty small selection of sandwiches which is nice in my opinion. I went with the italian, which has salami, pepperoni and other meats. U can pick what toppings u want on your sandwich. I got everything, lettuce tomatos, italian dressing and the hot peppers. If you dont like spicy food DO NOT GET THE PEPPERS! My wife had a bite and her lips and mouth were on fire! It was so good i came here twice in a row. Second time is when my wife came with me. She got the Mediterranean with chicken. It has hummus in it. I had a bite it was ok. My wife liked it but needed more seasoning. My wife also got a banana shake which was delicious! Overall the food was great and much better than subway with comparable prices!"}
{"text":"Tried A Wreck & Pizza Sandwich. Love the bread and the cheese. The online ordering system is not very good tho. I can't check the ordering history after I submit the order."}
{"text":"Potbelly, even through a chain, consistently delivers a great sandwich. Now they offer a turkey club, which I've gotten twice already and definitely will have again. This location also makes very tasty shakes in many flavors. Staff here is friendly and quick. The place is kept clean and well stocked in condiment and utensils area. It's great for a grab and go lunch and for eat in - I'm glad to have it by my office."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday and really enjoyed out time here. The food was excellent. The service was excellent as well. The atmosphere of this place was awesome as well. I like they have a little bookshelf in the corner you can grab a book and spend some time there. I noticed they have smoothies and malts, we'll have to go back for some of those."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here. Whole grain option available for those who don't eat straight up white bread like myself. The cheddar and chicken and mediterranean sandwiches are great and low on calories for how filling they are. The potatoe salad is to die for. (edit: I think it has been discontinued at this point though? sad face!)"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and shakes. Service is friendly but some of the workers are awkward and way too overbearing."}
{"text":"My first time there and the food was excellent. I got a turkey with everything on it and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, my goodness so delicious. The sandwich was toasty and flavorful and the cookie was soft and chewy.. Soooo good! I recommend this place to everyone who enjoys a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Potbelly always creates delicious sandwiches no matter the location. Service was warm and friendly. I ordered the wreck with meatballs added. \"Wrecking Ball\". Potbelly never disappoints."}
{"text":"love love love this place.  EVERYTHING is great on the menu... can't say enough good things about potbellys.... addicting and always great service.  super fast service and always friendly faces that greet you and make your checkout quick and your on to the next!!"}
{"text":"So this place is somewhat similar to Quiznos in a sense that you order a sub and then it gets toasted. The main difference between Quiznos and here is that you actually get to choose what extra toppings you want on it. The toppings include: mayo, honey mustard, hot peppers, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, oil, and Italian seasoning. 

I wish it said how big these subs are... I'm thinking they're either 7\" or 8.\" There's originals, bigs (30% more meat), and skinnys (thin cut breads) type of subs. I got an original A Wreck (salami, roast beef, turkey, ham, and swiss cheese) on multigrain bread. It cost $5 and it was pretty good! 

I also think it's interesting that they have some random guy playing a guitar and singing as their background music."}
{"text":"Got some lunch here today (was to lazy to drive anywhere else). Been here a few times this year. 

Anyways, they always have great customer service and the foods usually pretty good. As, I didn't have any issues with that today. Prices are about the same as Smash Burgers next door. Ordered the pizza sandwich (the big one) with some extra hot peppers. That there made the difference in making it delicious and mouth watering. 

The only disappointment was the bag of chips I bought with it. They were the Zapp's Voodoo Heat. They had no kick or spice for that matter and I know food from New Orleans has kick to it. They were kinda bland in flavor, but I still ate them anyways with the sandwich. 

Overall, I had a some good food and look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Love Potbelly back from their original days in Chicago!

A Wreck with everything except mustard, Macaroni salad and Chocolate Strawberry Shake - yum!"}
{"text":"Lovely staff, attentive and professional. The place is clean and has great simple sandwiches. Feels pretty healthy, of all the places on the strip here... If recommend this one!!! (:"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are routinely tasty. Not very busy at night so you can have your pick of the tables. Great milkshakes too!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a sandwich in all of Madison.  Possibly all of the world.  Roast beef sandwich is especially good.  The spices are special.  Delicious chocolate malts.  A great place to meet up.  The line, even when long, progresses quickly.  Very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"My girlfriend absolutely loves Potbelly. Unfortunately, nothing beats our Chicago locations. Our sandwiches were definitely smaller than average and our shake was basically solid ice cream. She and I found this place just as underrated as our Jimmy John's in Flagstaff. I'm starting to believe that everybody in Arizona has no idea what they are doing with food, even at chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Sad.  Ordered 4 items got 3.  Called the store, had to drive back to get the order they forgot.

I've had such good meals at other locations. I'm hoping this was just a fluke. I will try again. Very sad about the service today."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a franchise. The sandwich was okay. The live musician in the corner was unexpected. Parking is horrible. There's only a little lot, but they offer valet (which I always don't have cash for). Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Over priced, poor restaurant layout (not enough seating), small portions and decent sandwich."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, the service on the other hand, not so much... My boyfriend and I ordered two turkey clubs which comes with turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar cheese. He wanted the bacon that came with mine because I did not want bacon, and he did not want the lettuce and tomato on his so I said to put double of those on my sandwich. The first woman understood exactly what we were talking about, but once it got to the condiment woman, this is where the service got terrible. She was abrasive, rude, condescending, and overall unpleasant. I explained to her that I wanted the double lettuce and tomato and that my boyfriend was essentially \"giving me his\" and she rudely stated, \"I just want to know what you want on your sandwich\". I was slightly taken back but remained to have a positive attitude. As I sat down and opened my sandwich, I realized that I did not have any lettuce or tomato but my boyfriend had his double bacon. When I went back to the counter to say that I did not have either of these condiments, she stated, \"you didn't ask for any\" and proceeded to give me a dirty look as she threw a cup of lettuce and tomato at me. Stunned at what had just happened, I walked back to my table. Everyone else was very pleasant but I am extremely dissatisfied with this woman's attitude and costumer service. I do not believe that this woman should be working at a place that mostly involves communicating with customers and making them feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Potbelly's is a fun little sub shop. While there are many across the country, I frequent the one in University Circle. The staff is friendly, efficient, and eager to assist. The cute decor and high ceilings makes the shop very inviting. The food is good and I appreciate that subs can be made on a multi-grain flat, a more low carb option. They also have several soup options that are tasty. With all this, it's still a chain restaurant and the food feels mass produced. Consider splurging on an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. They're soft and delicious. The other great thing about Potbelly's is that they deliver to local businesses with only a $25 minimum order."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The decorations are so fun and the sandwiches are delicious. Also the service was incredible. My only complaint is just that there's not a lot of toppings, but other than that I will absolutely come back"}
{"text":"Split the Wrek with everything on it w the hubby. Should of had the BIG for myself soooo good! We'll make sure to get our own next time. Atmosphere is laid back and casual. Service is quick and polite. Live music on wed & thurs. afternoons pretty cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Live music was so loud couldn't hear each other talk.

Live music would be great for another venue but lunch time at a sandwich shop?"}
{"text":"Couple of friends of mine went here, ,said servers were rude & did not get their sandwiches right.
They will not go back. Sandwich not cooked right.  Review is True Correct. Fix the problem"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, good prices, and great customer service. Oreo shake was pretty yummy too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"How have I missed this placed??  Great sandwiches and shakes. On the higher end of pricing but within reason for what you get in quality and taste.  One of my favorite lunch places to go. Ask for the secret menu for a list of hidden gems."}
{"text":"Great experience on a day I needed it!

Got the Mediterranean salad and boy did it hit the spot. Fresh veggies and the balsamic dressing was just right. 

Went a bit early for lunch (11:30) and while they weren't busy, things were a little slow - staff were busy making sandwiches for call in/take out I suspect. 

Wish I would have gotten the name of the staffer who not only took my order but stepped up to finish it when another staff got called away. 

I'm not a sandwich fan at all so I usually pass by any sandwich shop. Glad I stopped in today."}
{"text":"Ordered a smoothie and the guy in the beginning yelled it to the employees ahead. That was all for nothing because they didn't start making it until after I had paid. Basically half my lunch was waiting for this smoothie."}
{"text":"Great selection and quality sandwiches. This is my go to sandwich shop. We just got one in Gilbert at San Tan Village and couldn't be more pleased.  If you haven't been, you need to give this place a try and don't forget the peppers."}
{"text":"The sandwiches may not be huge but they are plenty big enough. Do yourself a favor and and try the chicken salad sandwich with everything on it. My sister says the shakes are the best she has ever had. I still havent tried one but i cant wait."}
{"text":"Busy sandwich shop that always delivers great food!

Been here a few times and have only tried the vegetarian sandwich yet the menu offers a lot more variety than other sub shops. 

Despite the crowds, they get you through quickly and for a decent price. 

Rather limited in toppings (no spinach) yet otherwise a great alternative to Subway."}
{"text":"I went to this shop because it is convenient to my office.  The first time I went the sandwich was very mediocre, but I thought I would give them another chance.  I asked for mayo ON THE BREAD.  Not only did I not get what I asked for, but also one measly slice of turkey.   For $7.00 for a half of sandwich I would think I could get a little mayo and more then one slice of turkey.  My co-workers have asked how this place is, and believe me, I'll be sure to tell them!  How come I can't post a picture?  This IS NO MY PICTURE OF SANDWICH I GOT??????"}
{"text":"I usually don't give fast food restaurants 5 stars, but I can't say enough about this Potbelly's. The food was so so tasty and the options were plentiful. Not to mention that the cookies are amazing!"}
{"text":"I have walked over to Potbelly a couple times for lunch and have been pleased.  I recommend using the online order service as there is usually a line,  Walk through Latta Arcade and grab a nice table. I didn't give 5 stars because they were out of the soup advertised for that day of the week when I got there to p/u yesterday, and I substituted the potato soup - nothing special.  The 'wreck' was delicous; the skinny turkey is as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the 'Mediterranean'. Pretty decent sandwich for the price. The roasted red peppers they use are really good. I wish place had more vegetarian options though... I asked the cashier if they had a veggie sub, which really confused him. I'll probably visit again, but won't be a regular stop."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time ever, and I'd come back! We ordered everything on multi grain: ham and Swiss, grilled chicken, and Italian. Jimmy John's Italian is better! Anything beats Subway!! But my best/favorite one was the grilled chicken. I asked them to put Jardiniere peppers on them... and OMG, I was on fire!! Oohhhh lumbre! If I believed in hell, I was there!!!!
I gave some grilled chicken and bread to my baby, one and a half years old, big mistake...some chili got on there, it was not good... he was cryin!  Poor thing, mama won't do that again!!"}
{"text":"A great little sandwich place! I had the smoked ham(?) sandwich. It was delicious! Much better than Subway. Good prices too! Got the 6 inch sandwich, chips, and a cookie for about $7! Nice! The ice machine seemed to be a bit dirty that day though. There was something weird in my cup. Pretty unappetizing. But luckily I had just about finished eating before I went to take a drink! Need to explore this place more! But, as of right now, it's definitely solid! :)"}
{"text":"Always good food. Sandwiches always hit the spot and salads are great as well. Made to order and staff was very polite and listened to what I wanted on my sandwich."}
{"text":"((I am editing this review because the general manager contacted me to apologize, and she's a nice lady. This manager is still probably there, so I'm leaving that part there as a warning to others. Everyone else was pretty cool though.))

We went in at 2 pm, so it was slow. We were the only people in the whole restaurant. Never been there before, so we were looking at the menu. Someone, who I think was the manager because he was older and bald, kept teasing us for taking so long, thinking he was friendly. \"There's a test if you stare at the menu for more than 5 minutes. You guys aren't blind, you have glasses.\" No one else was there, and we were only looking at the menu for about 2 minutes tops. 

I came in for a bite before work, so I was wearing my uniform (another resturaunt from the area). Started ripping my company a new one. He was rude the whole time. My boyfriend and I were uncomfortable the whole time interacting from him. The rest of the employees seemed embarrassed by him. 

I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with no bleu cheese. It was decent. Not worth talking to that manager though."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I own Potbelly stock. Reason: because they have a good product. I just wish there was another location for non-students because parking sucks."}
{"text":"Classic chain sandwich shop. I think their sandwiches are tastier than subways. I like their side options like soup, mac n cheese. Also the shakes are pretty good"}
{"text":"Sandwich calories listed on the menu, you know what your getting into right from the start.  If your on a diet or not you know the damage right from the get go.  I do have to say I went with 2 other people and for the most part we enjoyed everything.  
I enjoyed the Chicken and Cheddar sandwich, but after tasting the Pizza sandwich I was wishing I went with that.  I also tasted the wreck salad, but I am not a fan.  The sandwiches are what I will come for and so should you.
Unique, fresh sandwiches, and I did enjoy the toasted bread.  If you are in the mood for a fresh, great tasting sandwich go here.  ."}
{"text":"We ate inside once and have done drive-thru twice.  The way to get to the drive-thru is weird.   

Warning:  The hot peppers are very hot.

My family likes their food.  I keep getting the pizza sandwich.   I tried a coffee shake and liked it also.

It's another great option in the area!   Next time I'll try a soup."}
{"text":"So happy to have my favorite sandwich shop in town!!!! Potbelly finally has made its way to AZ from Chicago. These are the things to know about Potbellys.

1. Peppers - This is my number one for them. Get the peppers!! The Potbelly peppers are by far tops to other establishments and will enhance any of their creations (besides the pb&j)
2. Bread - I always opt for my bread skinny (gutted so it more like the crispy crust without the fluff)
3. Chicken Salad - The best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had! That is saying a lot. I have had Stage Deli and even Katz's. (Make sure you get the peppers!!)
4. PB&J - I have actually flown from Chicago with one of these in my briefcase and ate it hours later. Yeah, the old school days of jelly soaked bread!!!
5. Service - Fast and always friendly!!!

Welcome to AZ Potbelly!! The one thing AZ needed, and it's doesn't need a lot, is a great sandwich place with tons of options!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome and helpful. Sandwich had fresh ingredients and was toasted perfectly. Will come back every time I get te chance!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel awkward and not know what you're doing, order here.

The set up is just totally weird and not instinctive.

The chicken pot pie soup is absolutely incredible so I'll probably keep going there anyway."}
{"text":"Tasty, clean, friendly service and accommodating. I ordered the chicken salad salad. They didn't have caesar dressing so I settled for buttermilk ranch. It was tasty. My colleagues were satisfied with their sandwiches and salads. Some were in shock at how big their sandwich was. The pastrami sandwich looks amazing. I plan on getting that next time. FYI that Zappos chips are sold here."}
{"text":"This is a new place in my neighborhood and I've been there a few times now. The food is great and I love the broccoli cheddar soup. The sandwiches are good I just wish they were a bit bigger. I've always had great service from the staff. Very friendly place to go and they offer up some great suggestions when I've been curious to try something. 

Great job!"}
{"text":"Simple menu options to choose from and filling portions. The service was super fast and friendly! I got the chicken and cheddar it was delicious and toasted to perfection. Also, if you can, try their baked goods they are amazing and taste homemade. The oatmeal chocolate chip cookie was so soft and chocolaty and yummy! Potbelly is more than a step above the usual boring sandwich spots."}
{"text":"Everyone has been talking about Potbelly opening in Uptown. From the Charlotte Agenda to my coworkers, people talk about loving it. I guess for that reason I expected to be wowed. I thought it was good but not the best sandwich ever (that award still goes to Jersey Mikes and Harris Teeter for me). 

I got a skinny turkey sandwich. My fiancé got the Italian. We both liked them alright but nothing about them really stood out. The employees were friendly. All in all, it was cool. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but if I were Uptown and wanted a quick lunch (and Pita Pit were closed), I would come here again."}
{"text":"Heck yeah!  Good sandwiches and soups!  I'd much rather go here than Subway or Jimmy John's.  I wish you delivered on weekends.  I've been in only twice, but I work weekends a few blocks away.  I end up with Jimmy John's all the time when I really want a great tasting sandwich with a bowl of soup.

Fix that."}
{"text":"Had a delicious hot Italian sandwich at Potbelly recently.  This is one of the best tasting Italians that I've had.  The ingredients are fresh and of good quality. I loved every bite of it. I always order my Italian with hot peppers, which kick up the spice a bit. But it's so delicious with the peppers!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on going out to lunch today, seeing as I'm coming down with the flu.  But my co-worker walked up to my desk and said, \"Lets go out to lunch!\"  I was like, \"Where are you planning to go\"?  He said, \"I don't care, anywhere.  I just gotta get outta here!\"  I said, \"Okay!  You driving?\"  

I mentioned a couple sub shops in the area and he said, \"Potbelly's is pretty good. It's on par with DiBella's.\"  I said, \"Lets go!\"  So off we went.

When I read the menu it wasn't clear what size sandwiches they made, but looking at the two pieces of bread on the counter was a dead giveaway.  So I ordered a Big Italian on whole grain bread.  As I picked out some chips, I noticed that my sub was being put through an oven.  \"Sweet!\", I thought.  I love hot subs.

I was then asked what I wanted on the sub.  \"Do you want hot peppers?\"  \"Yep!\"  \"Do you want lettuce, tomato?\"  \"Yep!\"  \"Do you want everything on it?\"  \"Yep!\"  Then she laughed and loaded it up with their house made peppers.

First bite into the sandwich was glorious!  Then the heat of the peppers hit me.  They were much more tasty than ordinary jalapenos, but around the same level on the old Scoville Scale.  These peppers had taste and kick and I loved every bite of it.  The hot peppers made the sandwich.  The meat and bread were tasty and fresh, but the peppers stole the show.

Loved it.  Will return.

PS: You can buy a jar of their house peppers for $6.95.  I'm gonna have to buy some next time."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte a year ago from Chicago and really miss some of the food. I love Charlotte just as much as I love Chicago, but when I saw Potbelly's it brought back all the memories. Potbelly's is a great sandwich shop. If you don't want to get a sandwich, you can get a salad. If your feeling a sweet tooth coming on then try the awesome milk shake with a butter cookie to top it off. And if your feeling in a really good mood or down try the mini chocolate chip cookies. I guarantee your spirits will perk up then. I say just try it out. If you don't like, you don't like it. There are plenty of places in Charlotte I don't like. This place is not like wich-wich."}
{"text":"Amazing. All the sandwiches are toasted and the breads really soft. My personal favorite is the wreck! Their oatmeal brownies are amazing too. I'm really not a fan of oatmeal typically but the recipe is great!"}
{"text":"Great basic sandwiches. Their hot peppers add a nice touch and I love that they'll scoop out some of the bread for you if you want to try to make your lunch a little healthier! Be sure to get there by 11:45 to avoid the lunch rush as the line can get pretty crazy after 12."}
{"text":"Love this location and the people here. I wish they had a potbelly where I live right now! So good! 

The staff put up with my crazy neediness (I'm sometimes really indecisive). They were quick to make my sandwich and even heat up my cookie for me! This potbelly wasn't as crowded as others, so maybes that's why I received my food so fast, but it was awesome customer service.

The seating here is smaller than some that I've been too, but the layout is great and easy to navigate.

I forgot to take pictures here, but I can tell you my sandwich and Mac and cheese were awesome. (Highly recommend the Mac and cheese and the double chocolate cookie).

The restaurant was clean and ingredients were fresh. I will definitely be back if I'm ever in town!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain, and they pretty much do sandwiches. But, something about this place makes me want to make the drive. I've got to have a bunch of other sandwich places in my way to ANY Potbelly location from my house, but I will pass all of them for the spicy proper melange they put on their sandwiches!

My favorite is the Italian with everything but mayo and mustard, or a chicken and cheddar plus bacon. Yeah, Nueske's thick-sliced bacon, crisped in their sandwich oven. It's extra but totally worth it!!

Their chili isn't bad, and they've got sweet tea AND Coke + Pepsi... So, you have choices. 

For dessert, the cookies are absolutely worth it. The first time I went to one of these places, I got the double chocolate cookies to go. They're baked daily... in the store... And they are fantastic!! I don't eat a lot of cookies any more, but these make me want to eat them all the time. My kids want to try the ice cream sandwich made with them... Maybe I'll break down next time. My wife prefers the oatmeal chocolate chip, which are great, too.

Don't forget the staff. The people at this location have ALWAYS been friendly and helpful. Even in the day after Thanksgiving... So, thanks to them!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Potbelly, I have been to several of your locations and can't recall whether I have written reviews of all of them. Sadly, none are close to where I live, so I have to plan my visits around other errands. 

It is worth the effort, though. When you want a quick sandwich, not many places can beat a fully loaded Italian or Wreck from this place. They run it through the oven to toast the bread, heat the meat, and melt the cheese. And, if you add bacon, it makes that nice and crispy, too. Then you add the toppings and produce at the next station. I think I've had every sandwich on the menu, including some of the specials that are no longer around. I had the simply dressed turkey with spinach and roasted red peppers this time, which was pretty tasty, despite just having basil mayo as the topping. 

The soups and chili are good, and people say their shakes are not bad, either. (I still haven't tried one of those). Their cookies are better than most places that aren't bakeries, and even some that are. They're made every day, and if you hit it right, you can sometimes get them right out of the oven! My kids like the chocolate/chocolate chip ones, which are like brownies in cookie form. 

They have sweet and unsweet tea, which is all I need. 

The people at this location are friendly and I have never had any complaints about my orders."}
{"text":"The 5-star rating is not to indicate that this is by any means a 5-star restaurant. However, as sandwich chain places go, this place is at the top of my list. Mostly because, of all the sandwich chains, this is the one that everyone in the family can agree on, especially if they can get cookies, which are baked fresh throughout the day. 

I've had most of the sandwiches on the menu, and I like their spicy pepper mix. There are a variety of bread options (white/wheat/flatbread, and a \"less bread\" option, too). The produce is always fresh and the people making the sandwiches take care to let you have it made the way you want it. They may not be \"freaky fast\" like some others, but they're pretty close most of the time. 

The chili and soups are also good, and this time was the first time that I tried one of their salads. On this visit, my first to this location, the Powerhouse salad with the balsamic vinaigrette was a great choice. 

This location is spacious and clean, and they have a drive-through window. I haven't done that, so I don't know exactly how that works -- I'd probably just use it as a quick way to pickup an order that I placed using their app. 

The people who helped us were friendly and our sandwiches were made as requested."}
{"text":"My favorite roast beef sandwich of all time... mmm, I wish there were Potbelly's in California!!!  Toasted just the right way and has soo many great toppings, in particular the hot peppers and their mustard set them apart from other places.  Used to be one of the only places I could find Orangina in Illinois, so a plus for that too!"}
{"text":"Came in to try out something different while visiting Scottsdale. Loved the Pizza Sandwich (added bacon too!!). The girl working told me about this Holiday Peppermint Shake and how she likes to put Oreos in it... Aaahhhmazing! Cute shop, breath food, quick, friendly service! Thank you."}
{"text":"This a great sandwich place.  It has a much warmer atmosphere than the typical sandwich chains.  Their sandwiches are toasted and delicious.  An added bonus are the freshly made smoothies, malts and shakes (no pre-made smoothies like some chains).  Very friendly staff.  For a quick sandwich, this is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Went in last weekend and tried the club. It was pretty cheap and for such a small sandwich, they packed on the meat and toppings. I honestly felt more full than I do when I get a footlong at a place like Subway. Also, the food is way better here and the staff was very nice and helpful since I didn't know what I was doing. I've been wanting to go back but unfortunately, there aren't any locations near my apartment. Will definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Always great service when I come here. Great small talk too. Kyle was really helpful today. I suggest you get the Grilled Chicken & Cheddar and an Oreo Shake."}
{"text":"This is a Northern store that decided to come South and I am glad! 

I got the chicken and cheddar and it was really good. 

The hot peppers were pretty hot so that is a plus for me. :)

This is hands down better than Subway or any \" quick sandwich \" place. I will be going back again and trying new things!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! variety good, prices great. Very helpful staff when I asked about ingredients because of my food allergies. Loved the food - perfect bread. My son (8 yo boy) said it was the best sandwich he's ever had - he ordered the pizza sandwich. And loved the giant pickles which were only $1. We'll be back again"}
{"text":"Very good place to grab a lunch with coworkers. Light and healthy options yet large portions and reasonable prices the place is very nice they have live music at lunch time nothing too crazy just a solo person playing the guitar. It accommodate large groups which is very good."}
{"text":"Mix Quiznos, Subway, & Jimmy John's, now add 15% to the price, you have Potbelly. The food is good but overpriced. You can get a sandwich, chips, and a drink of the same quality at any of the above listed places & the sandwich will either be bigger or cheaper than here. Cafe Rio next door is better, go there."}
{"text":"Ordered online and it was ready immediately when we showed up. Amazing customer service at this location"}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for soup and salad. Like, REALLY in the mood for it. I searched around on Yelp, and my husband and I probably walked a couple miles checking out different places menus and vibes. I'm usually not this picky, I swear! But this particular day I wanted soup and salad and a casual vibe. Potbelly's it was!

I had the Mediterranean Salad with a bowl of tomato soup, and my husband had an Italian sandwich with a cup of chili. He definitely won the food competition of who made the better order. My salad was fresh and the Potbelly vinaigrette was really good. But overall, the salad was just fine. His sandwich was really tasty and nicely toasted. I enjoyed my tomato soup, which was pretty basic. Again, his choice of chili was better! We ended up sharing. :)

I liked the casual vibe and the cute painted tables. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. I'm not sure I would seek out Potbelly's again, but if I were in the area and in the mood for a meal that I could pretend was healthy, I would return."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied. Ordered 2 of the pizza sandwiches online said it would be ready between 2:40-2:55. When we arrived at 2:40 no one was in the store and they had not started our order . I also ordered a cookie and asked for it to be warmed up. The staff was confused and initially could not figure out how to warm the cookie up. When we finally got our sandwiches neither had any marinara sauce. The sandwiches were so dry. I was looking forward to Potbelly's. Now I'm not at all ."}
{"text":"This was the 1st Potbelly I visited back in 2006, and I did not understand the fascination over the sandwiches. I literally cut my lip on the toasted bread, and I was more then upset at the concept of Potbelly.

So, I went back again in 2017 for a second visit, and OMG was I blown away by the awesome sandwich, chips, and cookie. I fell in love with the Roast Beef original on multi grain bread. 

It has been over 10 years since I first tried Potbelly, and each time I visit, it's like visiting for the 1st time all over again. 

I have not eaten at this location since graduating, but I'm sure the Green St. location is touching students hearts across campus. 

Thanks Potbelly for helping me thru my touch times while in undergrad."}
{"text":"I came here as its walking distance from where I work and it was really good! The staff were all really friendly and the restaurant itself was fun. The only downside - which I recognize is totally out of the restaurant's control - is how noisy it could get. I could barely hear the employees as I ordered my sandwich. Otherwise, this place is fantastic. I got the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich on the regular bread (they have multigrain available as well) and it was really tasty! There's not a whole lot of indoor seating, but they have outdoor seating in the shade, which is what I opted for. Pleasantly surprised with this place. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Take out lunch and grabbed a sammich from Potbelly.. Now, this is my first time here, and wasn't sure what to expect.. Sandwich selections were a little different, and definitely not the cookie cutter sammich shop. 

I opted for \"A Wreck\" and added mayo, lettuce, onion, and pickle. 

The bread toasted was VERY Good, nice flavor n texture, and all the \"Wreck\" ingredients were fresh.. The sammich is in my top 5 for east valley for sure now. 

Dine In area was very well organized, and clean. The staff were all attentive from my time there.. 

Why 4 Stars and not 5 ? Well, I wouldn't Drive Out of my way to get a sammich, except from one other place.. Now this could change after I validate the consistency and try a few more sammiches.. 

Yes, I WILL be back in the next week or 2. cheers"}
{"text":"Cannot go wrong with sandwiches here..never be afraid to try something different from the chains..will definitely come back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"Awesome place with awesome food and awesome customer service. I feel bad that one crappy review had to bring the score down for this place as I have had nothing but good experiences at this new location. My SO and I first came here on opening day and were greeted with a barrage of warm welcomes. The establishment is nicely decorated, clean, and has a drive-thru!! Score!! The manager is usually on site and very friendly and helpful along with his great staff. This is my SO's favorite sandwich shop and I like it as well, so I can definitely see us coming here frequently."}
{"text":"First time visiting today ... One of my husbands favorite places to go in Chicago so once he found out they were here.. We had to go! I got the \"Wreck\" on wheat and it was really good! Strawberry shake was one of the best I have had! A+ and I can forget my pickle YUM! Very clean and friendly staff... Had a local artist playing music at the door.. Which I always enjoy ... We will defiantly be back soon ..I would highly recommend anytime of the day"}
{"text":"While walking around downtown Phoenix looking for a place for lunch (serving jury duty) I stopped at a couple other places but nothing caught my eye until I happened upon Potbelly and their sign for protein packed salads. Had the Clubhouse,  pretty good and well worth the money.  Only complaint was that a lot of the spinach was bad, had to pick it out. But overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here around 3-4 times and every time is a great experience. The employees are always nice and make sure that I get the best sandwich ever here. I've never had an order messed up on here which is even better! The prices are definitely good in my opinion for the amount of food you get, I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Love potbelly! My husband and I have always driven right near this place, and never tried it because the name didn't create any appeal for us, but after trying it for the first time, we have to say its one of our favorite stop-in sandwich places. The sandwiches are great. They are definitely much, much better than Jimmy Johns, Subway, etc. and we definitely prefer this place over any of those. We both get the turkey, and I would definitely recommend getting the peppers!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I really wanted to love Potbelly!

They just opened next to my work, so I decided to spend my lunch hour at the hip new sandwich spot down the street.

I arrived at around 1pm. The place wasn't crowded, but there was a good amount of people. The workers were nice enough, but the ordering system sucks! You choose your sandwich and bread, only to have the next person down the line ask you what kind of sandwich you ordered. In addition, there was one person in charge of the first 3 toppings to choose from, and someone else for the rest of them. Why can't I just tell one person what toppings I want?

All in all, I would compare to the taste of the sandwich and feel of the process to Quizno's. Pricing is also similar; I paid nearly $9 for the sandwich, chips and a drink.

Like I said, I wanted to love this place, but it just wasn't meant to be."}
{"text":"As promised, bountiful sandwiches served relatively quickly by a friendly and responsive staff. I had no waiting on a Saturday evening, so perhaps the long lines are during the weekday lunch rush. The seating's café style and might have been cramped had there been anyone else in the restaurant, but there wasn't, so I had a good time spreading out.

I've been to a competing chain of stores that has pot belly stoves as bling (Erik's in California) and it's a good contrast between the California sandwich and soup vibe and the heartier comfort versions of the midwest/northeast. I prefer the former but Potbelly's plenty good for what it purports to be.

My only regret: I should have had another pickle."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good ! This is a great pace for a quick bite to eat ! I ordered the Italian sandwich and the gentlemen that helped me was very helpful the menu is huge as I show in the photos. A nice variety of shakes malts and cookies! The inlet thing I don't like is they charge you like 60 cents for peppers artichokes , garbanzo beans ! I feel the sandwich is 8 dollars already . Very clean inside and staff is very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"My first time here! Delicious italian sub toasted to perfection and very moist! Lots of seating and excellent customer service! Liked the atmosphere as well and prices are very reasonable! I plan to be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is super friendly!!!  I was having a really bad day at work and I decided to grab a sandwich and everyone was so nice that it made my day much better!  Not to mention the food was delicious!  Thanks for the awesome customer service and sandwiches!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"YASSSSS it's no lie-- huge Potbelly fan here!! So imagine my absolute delight upon discovering the new location which is closer and arguably more conveniently located-- with a DRIVE THRU window!! Woot woot! Potbelly NEVER disappoints. My faves are the veggie (mushroom and cheese) and the wreck. Do not forget the yummy soups and... oh those giant chocolate chip oatmeal cookies!!!. Consistently good, consistently fast, consistently friendly. You cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here. I really do. I got
 Mediterranean veggie sandwich. It was delicious :)


But omg, the customer service here was horrible.  Only two people were working. The guy was so slow while there's a line going on. Not only that,  we were waiting to pay for our sandwiches for 10 minutes.. ugh, next time someone has to order me.

Ehhh.. Probably won't be back to this location, I'll go to the one down camelback instead."}
{"text":"The last time I was at potbelly was in Chicago in 2010. I honestly didn't have any impressions on expectations so I rolled with the Cuban sandwich, and a vanilla milk shake. Like any other sandwich shop it's assembly line; wait, pick your poison, tell the staff what you want, shuffle down the line, pay, etc. The sandwich bread was solid - not dense and not light, but just right. There was more pulled pork than ham but both meats seemed okay; I typically don't think sandwich shops in general source quality meats. Pickles and mustard and cheese rounded off the sub and overall I would say it was a good sandwich and I would get it again. The milk shake was made from real ice cream and milk. Super thick and viscous. Comes with two small cookies on the straw. What I like the most about this place is the ambiance. The walls are festooned with local information which helps it feel like less of a chain."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch - super fast (even when the line is out the door), cheap and always delicious. My favorite thing is the chickpea salad with the Potbelly vinaigrette. The chicken salad salad is also super tasty.

Also, Potbelly has perfected the most rare of culinary delights: the fatty vegetarian sandwich. Seriously: get the mushroom melt. There's so much cheese, oil and mayo on it, you might as well get the salami. It's awesome.

My least favorite thing about Potbelly is that an infamous \"fauxbo\" (ie, not homeless, just a scam artist) has chosen this place as his favorite place to aggressively harass and panhandle customers. Ugh..."}
{"text":"Solid spot to grab a hot sandwich and some soup while walking around Uptown. I got the Turkey Club which was really tasty and the hot peppers are a MUST. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop hands down. First let me preface my review by saying if you want quantity, go to subway or somewhere else. The sandwiches here are smaller in size, but IN MY OPINION really make up for it in quality. The flavors and ingredients are so much better than subway, and it tastes a lot more fresh too. If you want to pay slightly more for a better tasting sandwhich, I'd recommend giving potbelly a chance. I'm a subway/quiznos convert and I'll never look back. Potbelly is my favorite and i try to spread the word to others who aren't from the east coast and encourage them to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until I moved to Phoenix.  I was curious about it, and finally decided that today was the day I would try them out.  I placed my order online and then drove down the 17 to Peoria to pick up my stuff.  The whole process went pretty smooth.  They didn't have my order ready right at 2:15, but they threw it together pretty quick once I arrived for pickup.  I ordered a \"Big\" Italian, a Chocolate Brownie Cookie and a \"Dream Bar\".  Total for everything was just over $10.00 with tax.  Here is how everything was..........

Italian-  Whenever I go to a new sandwich shop, I usually will order their version of an Italian hoagie.  If a place can make a good one of those, I will be back to try out their other stuff.  Potbelly's version of the Italian was good for the most part.  It comes with Capicaola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami and Provolone.  I got mine topped with lettuce, tomato, onions and oil/vinegar.  The loaf of bread they throw it on is very good.  Its toasted all the way around (inside and outside) and provides a nice texture.  The heating of the meats allows for the flavors to shine through.  About the meats....A little bit skimpish!  It probably only had one slice of each meat on the sandwich.  I would advise ordering \"double meat\" if you get one of their sandwiches.  I also noticed that the produce started to warm a bit too much after my short car ride.  It would probably taste better there in the store.  Still, it was a solid sandwich and better than a lot of chain type shops.  3.5 stars.  The sandwich was only like $6.49, so even though it was a bit skimp on the meats, the value to goodness ratio was definitely there.

Chocolate Brownie Cookie-  Delicious!  It was in round cookie form, but tasted like a warm, gooey brownie.  The cookie kind of fell apart in my hands, but it was damn delicious!  It had a little crisp around the edges, then super soft, and even a bit warm in the middle.  I would get this again.

Dream Bar-  This is similar to a magic cookie square my mom used to make.  Its basically a chocolate chip cookie base, topped with caramel, cut into bar form.  It was mighty fine!  Soft and smooth and you could tell that A LOT of butter went into these.  I have a super sweet tooth and this was right up my alley.  Definite repeat purchase.

Overall, I was pretty happy with my meal.  Order double meat, and eat it there, and you will have a great experience.  Service was friendly enough, and the price was excellent for a good, filling lunch.  I will be back to try out their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I think Potbelly is delicious. I'm not big on hot food usually, it's just a thing I have, but I LOVE their sandwiches and soups. Their prices are very fair and service is always very good. I've gone here the most because I live here, but I've also stopped by one in Chicago, and had the same opinion at that location. As a chain in general they do well across the board."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza sandwich, sounds much better than the taste. It was a good sandwich I just expected more being a pizza fan boy. I'll need to try out another sandwich to either give this review a 5 or 3 star. But for now 4 star. You're looking to spend about 10-13 bucks on a sandwich/chips/drink. Decent place for a quick bite. Free wifi too"}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying I absolutely love their sweet iced tea! It is excellent!  Probably a little too sweet but I can't help but like it. I've been here twice and ordered the grilled chicken and cheese sandwich and this time I got a vegetarian sandwich and added stuff to it.

The ingredients seem fresh but I'm finding their sandwiches to be rather plain. Maybe I'm not ordering the right stuff. I have tried dining in and the atmosphere was friendly. I have also gone through the drive-through and that was a good experience as well.   I think they forgot to put hummus on my vegetarian sandwich though unless they just put so little that I can't even tell it's there. 

I will come back for the tea, but the sandwiches so far are rather boring to me."}
{"text":"First time, solid sandwich.  Had pizza sub.  Was good but would probably double meat next time. Service average / friendly."}
{"text":"This place gave me an undersized sandwich and food poisoning that kept me consistently on the toilet for the next 48 hours.

I'd definitely avoid and so should you."}
{"text":"great sandwich as always with live music!  If you are in cleveland downtown don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I love Potbellys. Been going here somce I was in High School back in Chicago :)

I come to this location sometimes when I really want a hot sandwich. Me and my s.o ordered the pizza sandwich without the meat.

I had a great experience minus the tanned black-haired guy at the order station who shrugged at us when my s.o asked if she could have chicken on her pizza sandwich instead of the original meats on it. He said \"i dont know I guess\" and shrugged. There was like one person behind us and we felt rushed. Everyone else was super polite so I am just taking off one star. However, I would really like that guy to get some advice on proper customer service. 

I don't want to be picky but it really irritated me."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if you can tell by my passed reviews but I love sandwich shops. 
This is my 3rd or 4th trip to potbelly and I only have one complaint. 

What I like is they have a good selection of sandwiches, salads. The bread really sets the apart from the other places. It's a little flatter with bread like feel on the outside instead of the classic crunchy outside soft inside type of bread. 

My only issue with potbelly is I think there sandwiches are to small. I remember once while on a business trip we had lunch at potbelly and afterward the three of us were still hungry. We ended up going to another place for more food. For me, the worst thing is having a meal and walking out still hungry. 

Still, you can't beat the price. \"Large\" sandwich, chip, and drink was about $11. Not bad."}
{"text":"Yikes! Bad food safety practices. I stopped in and ordered two chickpea veggie salads, which are always super delicious. But today, the guy making the salads was bugged because he had to go to the back room to get more lettuce. He returned with a big tub of lettuce, holding it from the bottom (it looked dirty) and dumped it in the \"lettuce drawer\", then took the empty tub back to the storage room. When he returned, he made my salad by grabbing the various ingredients with his hands (wearing the same gloves he had on going back and forth to the storage room). He looked for some tomatoes, but there weren't any, so he slammed the fridge door, and left in a huff for the back room again. He returned with A FISTFUL OF TOMATOES! Wearing the same gloves, arranged them on my salad. I have no idea how many door handles, etc, he touched, but it just seemed super unsanitary. The guy at the register felt bad about the whole thing, so he didn't charge me...but I ended up throwing them out. I'm not sure, but I think the little huffy guy making the food was the manager."}
{"text":"Potbelly is a chain restaurant and I normally like to give my money to independent places. This shop is in Independence, Ohio. Eating out at lunch can be very expensive. It also does not help if you are sitting down and leaving a tip each time. This place is probably one of the better options for a quick bite to eat without having to tip. They have decent vegetarian options as well. I recommend the chick pea salad."}
{"text":"Been years since I've eaten at Potbelly but I'll definitely be back. Sandwich was the perfect thing for a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Service was exceptional. Clean space, friendly staff. And if you get Nathan serving you tell him Captain America says hi. He's awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch at 12:15 for downtown delivery at 1:15, an hour after the order was placed.  Over a half hour late, called the store, and was told the delivery guy went to some wrong address, and would be delivered \"any minute now.\"
15 mins later called store again, and was put on hold for 5 mins."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian. And, my first experience with Potbelly's was in Washington D.C.. I am a HUGE huge fan but most people not so much.

I've always been a fan of the mushroom melt. Something about fresh mushrooms loaded on a toasted bun with melted cheese that just sceams.. Yummy. Add peppers, and I am there. 

But lately, I haven't been a fan of sandwiches. Nothing against this chain , I just haven't been in the sandwich mood... so TODAY I had the roasted tomato and black bean soup.  I have also  had the roasted corn chowder, vegetable soup, and broccoli cheddar and I must say... 

Their soup, is actually far better than any of the soups I have had at any other Potbelly... they taste a little like Au Bon Pain soups... (delicious) and cheap. I walked away with a bowl of soup, chips and a cookie (lol) for 6 dollars and some change... 

and BTW.. the sugar cookie is too good for me to pass up.Sometimes I just come to this place just for a sugar cookie."}
{"text":"I had a wide range of emotions when I visited. #1 I was super excited to realize that I was close enough on other business to pop in and give this place a try. #2 I was disappointed when I saw the menu it seemed simpler than I expected. Not that that is a bad thing I just thought it seemed like most other sandwich shops. #3 I took my first bite and realized exactly what all the fuss is about. It was delicious. The roast beef was tender and tasted fresh. It was also extremely affordable which is always a plus in my book. The service was very friendly and professional. I visited right after they opened but from what I understand it gets super busy. If you are in the area and want a sandwich that puts the rest to shame stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location but I have been to one in Scottsdale. I ordered one of their signature sandwich's-The Wreck and my husband ordered the Pizza sandwich. The service was super quick and very friendly. The sandwiches were very fresh tasting. We also enjoyed New Orleans Zappa potato chips. While it's not the best sandwich I have had it's pretty darn good and we will stop in again."}
{"text":"Old favorite from Chicago. Try a shake and a Clubby (not on the menu). Great warm sandwiches and the location is good (near ASU and right next to a Starbucks)."}
{"text":"After having this location bookmarked for a while I finally made it today.
I arrived shortly before 12:00 on a weekday and the line wasn't too long.
Service was fine, nothing great.
As for my soup and sandwich it was good, nothing special.
I ordered the Turkey and Bacon, with a cup of Broccoli & Cheese Soup.
The sandwich was pretty skimpy on the Turkey and had so much mayo I couldn't really taste anything else.  I will say the bacon was cooked perfectly!
As for the soup, a little thicker than I liked but good.

Overall, it's a good sandwich shop but lines can be long during lunch, and I would say don't expect anything to different than some of the other places out there."}
{"text":"Good is good - not great. Customer service can use some work. I got the grilled chicken and cheddar sub. Never asked what size I wanted and when I asked to change it to \"bigs\" - I felt like I got an eye roll. The dining room it a bit small and crowded."}
{"text":"I got the smoked ham sandwich for around $6.50, if I remember correctly. It wasn't anything special, but it was a good sandwich. 1 star for the horrendous service. I came in on a Friday at around 4 and I was the only person when I got to the line up. She was already over everything and everyone well before I even opened my mouth to ask where exactly to place my order. She then proceeded to get my order wrong, which I wasn't the least bit peeved about by any means, but she definitely had a problem with it after I reiterated my order and she made a show of swearing and slapping bread and meat together to unceremoniously shove my poor sandwich into the toaster. She was also really rude to the guy behind me, so I guess this might just be the Potbelly experience? There were two others working behind the counter and the general vibe was that everyone hated their jobs. 
I'll just get a $4 hotdog from across the street next time; the pigeons are much more welcoming."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops has arrived in the Queen City. As a former Washington DC native, Potbelly was my go to spot for lunch or a quick dinner. I stopped on 1/20/17 and the service was fast and friendly. Do yourself a favor and try the Wreck on flatbread. Potbelly has arrived and I'm thanking the gods up above."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff. I placed an online order but showed up early and they made it for me right away! Great wifi location and I love the fooda"}
{"text":"First time at Potbelly's and loved it! The Mediterranean sandwich was a titillating treat. The bread was definitely the best I've had at a sandwich shop downtown. My friend said his sandwich was an adventure for his mouth!"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to try Potbelly's....like a long long while given that they are located right near my house. It just never seemed that interesting to me, but the husband loves sandwiches and we've heard good things about this place, so we decided to check it out. We ordered a couple sandwiches to go. I got some kind of Mediterranean chicken sandwich. Honestly, it's a bit like a glorified quiznos..... The sandwiches are toasted, which is nice, but they're not that hot and the ingredients didn't taste particularly special. It's fine for fast food sandwiches but not a place I would probably frequent."}
{"text":"Subway's too cliche (look at me, sounding like a hipster :/) and I'm protesting Jimmy John's because of the owner's rather egregious practices against animals and (allegedly) women (again, hipster)-- and who the heck thinks it's okay to charge 3.25 for a piece of bread and provo cheese, WTF? 

So hooray for Potbelly's! The sandwiches are delicious similar to Quiznos and Subway. The sandwich artists are pretty rad and know how to toss their sandwiches right! The chips are gross, though. Very bland and dry, blechh! Overall, a great change of pace to the other shops that are around town."}
{"text":"Great soup! Chicken enchilada soup is on point. Great custom sandwich. Grilled chicken is the bomb"}
{"text":"Really good food, go with coworkers about once a week. Not too busy if you go early. Parking can be a hassle."}
{"text":"Disappointing sandwich. First time trying it since I got a free sandwich \"perk\" so maybe that's why it's super skimpy. Sandwich is mostly all bread. I can literally count the pieces of lettuce, and the wreck advertises itself with four different kinds of meat - aka one thin slice of each meet. Asked for extra tomatoes, got two slices for the entire sandwich. All I taste is slightly warm bread. 

The two stars is for the pickle - huge pickle nicely cut for $1 was great."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have had since moving to Toronto. Loved it so much that I'm going back for dinner!"}
{"text":"This was our first (and last) visit to this restaurant. The gal who took the phone order wasn't rude but brusque. The chickpea salad was good, but they missed taking the onion off - and there were many. The tuna was ok but very bland - no taste at all really. The pizza sandwich was the biggest disappointment. They totally forgot the marinara sauce and provolone cheese. So there was one small meatball, a couple mushrooms and a small slice of capicola. Bland and miserable. I wish I could post a pic. 

Granted if we had eaten there I'm sure it would have all been fixed but that's kinda the point of take out. 

So our review: meh."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice. I love their hot peppers. Obsessed really, I'll put them on anything. You can buy jars of the peppers to take home too. The soups are always a great choice, Turkey club is dope. The bread gets toasted, you can add on avocado, and finish it off with a cookie. The desserts here are always top notch. They also offer smoothies and shakes. Malted powder is free! The vibe is chill, there's comfy, shaded outdoor seating (shared with Starbucks). Indoor seating is good too, not a big space but it didn't feel crowded anyway. Great place to study."}
{"text":"I love potbellys but for the price the sandwiches are small. Back in Chicago the potbelly sandwiches are bigger? Or at least I don't ever remember them being that small?!?"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken salad sandwich. The chicken salad was bland & on the dry side. I also had the coleslaw. It tasted like raw cabbage with no dressing. My husband had the Italian & was very underwhelmed with it. I could get a better sandwich at Subway."}
{"text":"First let me say, if you have an big appetite this is not the place to go hungry. I was hopeful that it would be a good sub by how busy they are at lunch time. The gentleman making the sandwiches was great, made some recommendations and was helpful. When he pulled out the bread I asked him for a large. One size on all the sandwiches (small)... I will say that the quality was great and far better than a subway or even Quiznos. Price wise, I couldn't justify ordering 2 sandwiches to fill me up more."}
{"text":"The man who made my sandwich was extremely rude. I felt very uncomfortable because of his demeanor. Won't ever go back to this potbelly location."}
{"text":"This was my second time having a sandwich from a Potbelly Sandwich Shop.  I ordered a Classic Turkey Breast & Swiss on a \"Big\".  I wanted everything on there but I don't think they put the pickles on. Other than that the flavor of the sandwich was delicious.  I ordered through uber eats so it wasn't as good as it would have been because it was just a little cooled off but it was still really good."}
{"text":"Not the best experience at all. First, all three women - attitudes. Next-sandwiches=soggy mess. There is an art to sandwich making. Rule one-don't half assed slice the bread. They were more worried about their Starbucks order from next door than making a good sandwich. Purchased a medium Mac n cheese - it wasn't even filled half way. I guess I should have offered a small? I'm giving it a two star because I like their bread rolls. Maybe I'll try again in another location? This one however, not again."}
{"text":"Where should I start?  The prices are normal-to slightly high.  What struck me immediately when I got there was the similarity between Potbelly and Jimmy Johns.  I ordered a salad with added hot peppers and onions, and a large pickle.
My salad was missing the dressing, the onions, AND the peppers.  I never got my pickle at all.
Worst part of all of this?  The tomatoes and meat in my salad were FROZEN SOLID.
Will I go back?  NEVER."}
{"text":"Having frequented this chain in other states I knew what its all about. Glad to see one somewhat close to home. They just opened tuesday so I expected some operational issues. I'm happy to report there were none. The slow line comes from confused customer's in awe of the sandwich making process. My favorite A Wreck was tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"I can't wait to visit.  I frequented Potbelly in DC all the time for lunch, can't get any better when it comes to sandwiches.  From what I have read they are living up to their name here in Charlotte.  I'm so glad the new location is within walking distance of my job."}
{"text":"This place looked to the best sandwich spot in the walking area so I stopped by. 

The menu has a few options for basic sandwiches and I went with A Wreck as it looked most unique from the others. Ordering is as easy as ordering through the assembly line at Quizinos: get in line, choose your sandwich, they drop it on the oven belt, then choose your toppings and you're done. 

About the flavor and taste, it seemed fairly standard. Not a single bite where I was blown away, so I went with a 3-star rating.

The decor is nice with a historic look with photos of old-time Phoenix and I like that enough to give it a half-star. Is there a way to rate .5's?"}
{"text":"I believe that they have the best subs available anywhere.  Quality fresh ingredients. I love the turkey and Swiss and like to add bacon. The best thing about them is the cookies. The chocolate brownie cookie is the best cookie you'll ever eat. Make sure and get one."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, each time hoping it would be better than the last. I love sandwiches and wanted so badly to like this place. However, their meat is not to be desired and despite the fact that you can add hot peppers and seasonings to your sandwich, mine have completely lacked flavor every single time."}
{"text":"The sandwich was ok, nothing special. Young man behind the counter was mire interested in where he would take my order than actually taking. Don't drive out if your way and don't expect anything special and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Was happy this opened near our house after going to the N. Scottsdale location for years.  After 2 visits, we are not returning to the new Chandler location.  The problem on both visits was bad lettuce.  On the 2nd visit, my wife found a lot of rusty cores in her salad.  On our first visit, The lettuce was old & limp on both of our sandwiches."}
{"text":"Got it delivered and everything was so delicious. Its super cute how they put cookies on the straws for your shakes. It did take a little long to deliver, but it was well worth it. 
I got a blt sub with a side of tomato soup and my friend got tuna melt and broccoli and cheddar soup, and everything tasted super fresh and toasty and I'd definitely buy there again."}
{"text":"Sandwich was really good and the price was reasonable.  I just wish you didn't feel so rushed when ordering so I can fully understand what goes into the sandwich.  I had to reorder cAuse my kids sandwich was spicy.  They were kind enough to replace it for free.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My daughter's favorite!  Healthy food served here without a healthy price.  I eat there often and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad. I would call it a high end Quiznos. Nothing to write home about. Employees are high school kids and aren't taking customer service to the next level by any means."}
{"text":"First time...Last time
Wife's sandwich was lacking, and honestly, mine tasted average.  Two shakes where remarkably without taste and about 3/4 full.  My wife said the staff appeared to busy to notice the lack of quality."}
{"text":"I love potbelly. Has a fun atmosphere and staff is always really friendly.  Sandwiches are delicious - try them with their hot peppers and the potbelly vinaigrette.  Also make sure to try their shakes - super delicious. Also very affordable."}
{"text":"this is a basic deli with sandwiches, soup, salad. nothing particularly amazing food-wise, but it is good enough that I'd go again if I was in the mood for a sandwich. I would've given it 4 stars except for the horrible parking situation. don't come during the lunch rush unless you want to circle the small and very thight parking lot several times looking for a spot.

one plus is that they sometimes have live music at lunch, which is fun."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is super nice and generous.   I'm from Los Angeles and a friend recommended this place.  I'm so glad we came to this location because Jaime and Tawny were just the best.   Definitely coming back to this location when I'm in Arizona again!!!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed a sandwich here for the first time. Sammy was yum, but I really wanted to review the employees. Everybody was is in such a great mood! Each employee I interacted with was smiling and incredibly pleasant, but not in a fake way. They were working well together and really seemed to just be enjoying themselves, which made going through their line really enjoyable. Much better than being made to feel like you are forcing them to do some work, like at some other quick food places. I'll definitely be back, thank you for making me feel welcome!"}
{"text":"It was ok, edible at least but not my kind of sub shop. Not a lot of options and very little info given. \"Mustard\" is actually stone ground Dijon only for example. If simple is your thing and you like their limited choices its probably okay but I didn't think it was as good as WhichWich or Port of Subs even."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations because I have heard nothing but great things.. well Potbelly's.. you succeeded them admirably. My perfectly toasted Italian sammy was damn delicious and now I'm afraid I'll never be able to eat at another sandwich place again. Pair it up with a nice cold IBC root beer and a little Zapps chips action.. it won't get any better."}
{"text":"I got the roast beef sandwich with chips and a tea. The service was quick and it was literally packed. Lunch in downtown Phoenix! The staff was extremely polite and even started taking orders by walking down the line of customers to ensure everyone got their food promptly. Def will be back."}
{"text":"The menu and food here was great! The service, was horrible! I think for a sandwich shop downtown, you should be able to work quickly, be friendly, not get flustered however; the staff the day I went in had none of those things going for them. And worse, were very un-apologetic for being so! I repeated my order (a simple turkey sandwich) to 3 different people and 4 times total. As I repeated it a 2nd time to the 3rd person, she said \"Ok, I got it!\" when I repeated it louder than the first time I told her. (My fault apparently) Then we waited for them to figure out who had what sandwich, one came out before the other (my friend's) The whole situation was way too frustrating. But unfortunately, I loved my food so I will most likely go back and hope for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are unreal. 

Loaded potato soup was like mashed potatoes. Which is a good thing."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place since it has an overall rating of 4 stars. I am very disappointed however. I had the Italian and my husband had the grilled chicken with cheddar. Both sandwiches were on white roll. The sandwiches just had zero flavor. The bread was dry and bland, my husbands chicken was dry and flavorless. Even the tomatoes on my sandwich had zero flavor. We will go back to Jersey Mike's instead."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for a sandwich. Prices are extremely reasonable and food is great! Easy to order online and pick up -- we did this a couple times at work, everyone ordered and paid individually online. 

I had food from here twice and both times I got the same thing because it was just that good: skinny beef, add mushrooms, peppers, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The second time I added a cup of the broccoli cheese soup which was also great.

One of my coworkers got a shake -- I just wanted to eat the little cookie that they put on the straw."}
{"text":"$9.50 for a dry tuna sandwich. There are too many places to eat around the area. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I just wanted to give a kudos to the Potbelly location at 534 W. McDowell Rd. PHOENIX, AZ 85003 (7TH AVE & MCDOWELL).

I stop by about twice a week on my lunch break to get a quick bite to eat and the place is always fantastic. So great in fact that I had to stop what I was doing and actually reach out to you because whoever runs this location doesn't get paid enough!

- Its Fast! The line workers are really quick and even if there is a long line at lunch they cut through it like a hot knife through bread.
- Its Clean! The place is always spotless. From the tables to the bathroom they keep this place immaculate. 
- The staff is very nice! Always pleasant, haven't had a single bad experience. Always a smile on their face.
- It's delicious! The bread, meat, and cheese is awesome! I especially love their oregano/salt/pepper seasoning! 
- The price! I can get a regular sandwich, 2 bags of chips, and a soda for just over $10.00. Not too shabby!

The only thing I would change is:

- The place needs more parking but they share the lot with several other business's so this isn't their fault. 
- They could use a little more variety on bread. I would love to see some sourdough, asiago, etc. 

Again, fantastic place, keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru and ordered two sandwiches and sides.
They said they didn't have potato soup so I asked for Mac and cheese. At the window they told me they were out of Mac and cheese so I ignored the sides. Got home and my sandwich was ok but my wife's was made with 2 separate meats. She had a turkey club and they put sliced turkey on half and some large chunks of chicken on the rest."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite between lunch and dinner. Stacy and Eric provided excellent service. Eric also provided good tips for future visits. Excellent service and good food will have me returning."}
{"text":"Skip the Subways and the Blimpies, Potbelly is SO much better! I've never had a sandwich here that wasn't good (but the Turkey Club, Tuna Salad and Meatball are standouts...and the Wreck if you're a starving carnivore). The staff at this location (Scottsdale Rd near the airpark) is the best...professional, but friendly and definitely on the quirky side. You'll always get good service here with a funny comment or conversation to go with it. Oh, and try the cookies (freshly baked) and the ridiculous shakes!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is my 1st Yelp review & this was my 1st time at a Potbelly Sandwich Shop. I got the Mushroom Melt sandwich, a strawberry shake, 1 oatmeal chocolate chip cookie & 1 chocolate brownie cookie. EVERYTHING WAS FABULOUS! no complaints. The service was outstanding. The cookies are addictive. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Being that the company I work for is based out of Chicago, I've had Potbellys once in a blue moon while working out of the mothership.  It's funny when folks from our Chicago office visit due to our location in Charlotte has a lot of the same chain restaurants that surround our Chicago office.

Either way, I was sad to see my Salsaritas spot go, but having the location in the Overstreet Mall didn't really make sense (two Salsaritas in a two block radius!).

I like what they did with the dining area.... they really took some time out to think about the local art and even have a custom skyline bench that borders one of the walls.

I came on an off peak lunch hour, cause their lunch line is ridiculous (well any place Uptown has a mad lunch rush).  So I think the employees were \"recovering\" from the previous lunch rush.  Trash was still on the tables, but I did see someone cleaning up while I was dining in.

Sailed through the line pretty quickly so no complaints and my Mediterranean sandwich was pretty darn good...  should have added the chicken."}
{"text":"When was the last time the napkin holders were cleaned based on these pics?  All were like this.  Under soda machine, same problem.  If they don't clean the napkin holders...a simple and obvious item a customer would see...what does the back kitchen look like and how do they handle the food??"}
{"text":"I ordered the roast beef sandwich, it was good. Nothing that jumps out about it, I did like the bread it came on. Establishment is clean, restrooms were clean, staff friendly. It was good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Got the Tuna Salad, and friend ordered the Italian. We both agree, this place is a much much much better Subway. The Tuna Sandwich was soo soo good especially with the hot peppers. 

Make sure you get the hot peppers. How can you go to Potbelly, and not get the Hot Peppers! Come on! Been here a few times but felt the need to review it again. It's just that darn good."}
{"text":"Its nice to have a new sandwich shop to replace the Mr Sub that moved out of the mall.  So far i have had the chicken sandwich and the Roadt beef.  The chicken is ny far the better sandwich with a great roast chicken flavour and not dried out at all."}
{"text":"I have been to Potbelly Sandwiches twice in the past week.  both times I ordered the Chicken and Cheddar sandwiches.  I got it from the new location at the Sheppard Centre and also at the location at Yonge and King St.  both locations sandwiches were fantastic.   You never know if a chain will have inconsistent food from different locations but both were great.  It's a great addition to the boring sub sandwich shops.  This stuff is fresh tasting and full of flavour."}
{"text":"Always great food at Potbellys. Had the Wreck today, usually get the grilled chicken breast and cheddar, either way get the macaroni salad for a side dish. I think the laid back staff is part of what makes this a great casual sub shop. Doesn't have the corporate feel of a subway. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place has poor reviews already. I lived in Minnesota for a minute and these were everywhere and was a better option than most sandwich places. Maybe I just love this place because I'm always cold and I could get a hot sandwich and delicious soup, plus the quality of ingredients are far better than subway, much more flavorful options in the way of drinks, the sauces they use on the sandwiches, the variety of chips and sweets. I was so tired of the same ol Taco Bell, McDonald's, or subway on every corner..the kind of food you can taste the regret as you eat it. I was super excited they built a Potbellys on the west side, even though I felt bad the first time I got to try it was 10min before they closed. Still the staff was friendly and everything was fresh tasting. I hadn't enjoyed Potbellys in so long that I was overwhelmed with excitement and we ordered a little bit of everything, I was so full. Their shakes are the best! The Oreo Milkshake actually tasted like a fully balanced, blended Oreo milkshake from start to finish and was probably the best milkshake I've ever had. All the menus and ingredients everywhere can be overwhelming so we may just order online next time so it's not rushed. Looking forward to coming back and trying something new soon."}
{"text":"Ugh. Potbelly. I keep going back, and I keep getting burned. 

Today I was SO happy when my food was ready ON TIME. That was a first in a long time. The gentleman who greeted me could have been a little more friendly, but I didn't even care. He brought my food out and I was good to go. In and out in less than 5 minutes. That's a win. 

When I got everything back to the office, though, my excitement quickly disappeared, as I noticed multiple screw ups with our order. 

1st - I ordered one of the salads for a group. The Farmhouse. I asked that onions be left out, as we have an onion allergy in the office. The whole things was littered with onions. And they aren't the big, easily picked out onions, either. They are tiny little chunks. 

2nd - I ordered an individual sized salad off the underground menu for myself. I *hate* bleu cheese, so I asked that it be sub'd with cheddar. This not only came with loads of bleu cheese, but it was also the group size. Cool. A GIANT salad that I can't eat. 

3rd - We got absolutely NO salad dressing. Yay! Dry salad! Luckily we order salad from other places and we have a decent stash of dressings, but come on! 

If it's not one thing, it's another. Just can't seem to get it right here."}
{"text":"Albeit on the pricy side, Potbelly definately makes a mean sammie. I mainly get the Wreck with mayo, mustard, hot peppers and a pickle. Add a side of jalepeno kettle chips and it's a nice meal. It doesn't fill me up, but sure tastes good."}
{"text":"This location had just opened when I moved into the area last year and I was SUPER excited!! I was sure I'd be there at least once a week. I definitely haven't been there THAT often, but I do frequent this potbelly's and the service and food quality are consistently good.

Clearly it's a chain so food quality is usually similar across the board, but unlike another chain down the street, they are always in stock of everything! YAY! I've been here for lunch/dinner many times and breakfast a few times post night shift. I'm not the biggest fan of their breakfast sandwiches- it's just a lot of bread and ends up being kind of dry IMO.

But, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their toasted sandwiches. My go-to is usually the mushroom-melt. Last night, I tried their soup as well. I was feeling under the weather and just wanted soup. Didn't want to travel too far for it, had nothing to make my own at home, and Zoup was closed, so I got the Southwest veggie. DELISH- spicy so it made it hard on my throat that was already hurting, but it was SO tasty I didn't care!!! YUM YUM YUM. 

The service is always wonderful. The girls behind the counter are always so funny and nice! Yesterday, I saw some male faces I'd never seen before and they were just as friendly - not as funny ;D but that's OK, as long as you're nice and efficient, I'm happy :)

My only complaint? Hours... They are open till 7 M-F, only open till 3 on Saturday, and closed on Sundays. I get why - they wouldn't get much business, but with how downtown is expanding nowadays, I sure hope this changes and their hours extend."}

{"text":"When did the corner of 7th and McDowell become such a food Mecca? Wow! Stopped by for a sandwich after an Easleys run. Had to decide where to eat because of all the choices around there. Decided on the new place ( for me at least) so in I went. It is a Cute Ex-Antique shop, the staff were very nice, the sandwich was decent. Small for the price though. For me that works well, maybe for others, not so much. 

   My sandwich tasted exactly like a chicken salad sub from Firehouse Subs. They opt for the entire toasted and heated sub trend. I enjoyed the sandwich but I like Firehouse subs better. Firehouse donates to charity and to be honest their sandwich is larger.
(Maybe even cheaper) Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with this place. I would go back. It just did not, \"Wow\" me. I am on the search for the perfect NY sandwich without the long drive to, \"Cassellas.\" The search continues."}
{"text":"Not a good overall experience.  Service was very slow and not friendly like the sign on the door promotes.  The food is just ok."}
{"text":"We always order the food from there for our team meetings. They had good  smoothies. Sandwiches are also fine. I'm not a big fan of this restaurant but it's okay to have them as a work lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"A Wreck\", \"Meatball\", \"Pizza\" and \"Tuna Salad\" sandwiches. My personal favorite is the Wreck that has Salami, Roast Beef, Turkey and Ham.

Love the bread and being toasted, so you order at the counter, the put together the sandwich put it through their conveyor belt oven that toast the sandwich, as it comes out the other end the then proceed to add the items requested.

Great lunch that is quick and high quality sandwich"}
{"text":"Potbelly is awesome! I didn't go there until junior year since it's a bit far as compared to JJ's or subway. But it's similarly priced, portions are plenty but most importantly it tastes better! The ambience is much better too giving it a much more welcoming feel (sometimes they have live musicians)"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for the best sandwhich of your life you should check out Potbelly! 

Everything from thier meat to thier bread to the fresh veggies they put on your sandwhich will make you want to go back the next day (which I have done) 

The only thing I have tried that I wasn't very impressed with was the Pizza Sandwhich. It wasn't bad, just not amazing like the rest of thier Sandwhiches. 

Just go here! It's amazing :)"}
{"text":"If you work in downtown like I do, you can place your order online first and and pick it up at a specific time during lunch hour. Not only you can create a sandwich exactly to your liking, you also do not need to stay in line for pick up. Why wouldn't you want to do that? 

I love their meatball sandwich. My only complain is that ingredients tend to fall all over the place when i eat it at my desk. I always order my sandwich with their Jalapeno chips. I will come back here again for their sandwich"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people think this place is so amazing?  I don't care for the cattle like way they shew you through the ordering process and their food really isn't that good!  Maybe I'm just missing the boat here.

They make a killer cookie shake though!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, super friendly and helpful. I do like this place but nothing about their sandwiches scream \"this is awesome, this is amazing!\" Just being honest, I do enjoy the Coconut Pineapple Smoothie (limited time menu item).

I was undecided on the rating...the staff and customer service, five stars hands down but just food...more like a two or three stars, nothing really to brag about. 

I also like the name...Potbelly (giggle)"}
