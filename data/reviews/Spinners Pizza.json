{"text":"Love the pizza and breadsticks. We come from another town and do carry out. It's with the 10 minute drive."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay....certainly not the worst in the world,  but it is NOT worth anywhere near the price they charge.  The kids in the kitchen were horsing around rather wait on the person who walked to the register.  On top of it, owners are  right-wingers...I think the decor is supposed to be patriotic (to give them the benifit of the doubt)...but it comes off as vapid and jingonistic.  There are better, nicer places."}
{"text":"was ok, was not overly impressed. just like a reg pizza. not sure if i would buy again ..."}
{"text":"If you want really good pizza with some pizzazz then Spinners is the place to go. I've had about four different pizzas and various chicken wings and have not been disappointed. I also love the fact that they have the credit card readers with the delivery person so you don't have to read your card information over the phone."}
{"text":"I decided to give Spinners a try today.  I ordered carry out because I wanted to see the place for myself first.  The restaurant is very clean, has two really nice TVs, and is decorated in a patriotic theme.  They offer a 15% discount to veterans, you just need to dig out your old ID.  My wife and I both liked the overall flavors of the pizza.  I particularly liked the sauce.  We both felt the pizza should have been cooked a couple of minutes longer.  It was done, but it was just barely done and that's the reason for 4 stars vs 5.  I will definitely be ordering from Spinners again, I will just ask for my pizza to be a little more crispy."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I'm glad there is a another place because I'm tired of the other ones in town.  They support veterans and this is important to me. I love the wings, so good.  I would recommend spinners pizza to anyone. They are professional, consistent and friendly"}
{"text":"We've had delivery twice and I'm a fan! The pizza is really pretty good and it's not greasy like some local pizzerias (ahem, Glass Nickel). The cheese bread is also really good. We also ordered spaghetti which was ho-hum, but I asked them to add meatballs to it and they did so that was a plus. Delivery drivers are really nice and I like that they carry a phone with a credit card swipe on it so I don't have to give out our card # over the phone. We'll definitely order again!"}
{"text":"The pizza was actually very good.  But, the restaurant decor is all about freedom, guns and Donald Trump.  That's a dealbreaker.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the garlic breadsticks! I could just sit and eat these for dinner.  Each time I go in the staff are so nice.  And the delivery drivers are great too! We usually get a deluxe pizza on thin crust. Just delicious. Tastes like it's made with quality ingredients. Great pizza addition to Stoughton. Also love that vets get a discount and tips go to charity.  Being able to give back while eating delicious pizza when I'm too pooped to cook... it's a win win!!!"}
