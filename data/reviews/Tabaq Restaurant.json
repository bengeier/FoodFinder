{"text":"Terrible overall experience here. Waited over an hour for our order, only to then discover they had completely forgotten about us. Then we finally got our food and it was easily the worst Indian/Pakistani food we've ever eaten. Ordered the biryani, nihari and butter chicken from here and it was all just completely tasteless. 
The place was very busy, so I'm not sure if there's at least one dish there worth trying, but surely we make much better food at home out of all the dishes we tasted from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Butter Chicken in the GTA hands down!

If you haven't had it yet - you haven't tasted butter chicken yet. I salivate as I think of it. No joke."}
{"text":"This is place is in the food court of a sketchy mall, there is nothing wrong with the mall, it's just not your usual mall. I would say Tabaq is the best compared to the rest. I have tried a couple of curry dishes and Haleem has been my favorite. The food is spicy, and it is served with freshly baked Naan, pop, and a side salad. Naan is $1.50 and it's worth getting two."}
{"text":"best halwa puri in north america...we especially come from new york for their halwa puri"}
{"text":"~3.5 stars ~

I been going to Tabaq when they also were try to run a restaurant where now Watan kabab resides. I used to grab the breakfast or have the breakfast buffet from there and then they closed off that location and concentrated on the current one.

Grabbed Halwa Puri nastha (breakfast) and I would say it was greasy and good.The meal came with 2 Poori freshly fried, Halwa (Dessert), Aloo curry (Potatos), Channa curry (chickpea), small portion of Achaar (pickle). The entire meal was hot and fresh and packed nicely so it doesn't leak.

Over all it was a good greasy experience.

FYI... this place is halal!"}
{"text":"The worst Chicken biryani that I have ever had !
 The meat was just boiled pcs. Of chicken with absolutely no marination or flavour .
Very unhygienicand no one uses kitchen gloves... my 1st and the last visit.
Avoid at all costs ."}
{"text":"Best biryani I have had in North America! The place is far from fancy, but with the most delicious food, and for an affordable price! $6 feeds two!"}
{"text":"Best halwa puri nashta with excellent chanas. Their prices are very competitive as well. Don't expect high level of customer service. Also their kabab combos are great."}
{"text":"My experience was not good. Since I am vegan that's why. And I was new at that time in Canada so I went to this place. But I think this place is a must for non vegetarians. I heard people were ordering Nihari so it must be there speciality. Staff is also nice and a bit fast too."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Ladies on the cash register are pretty dumb and really have language barrier.  The place is very dirty . No one uses gloves. Naans are burnt , chicken biryani is horrible with no flavour or marination. They serve rotten salad."}
{"text":"Halwa poori is the top .. truly pakistani, and that too from Karachi .. the best that you can have in Ontario .. nihari, paaye, kebabs are good but there are better ones too. The place is a food court of a random mall, but if you can avoid the rush hours, then it is certainly convenient and enjoyable to have the halwa poori piping hot."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Newin Center.  It's a small food court that's predominantly south asian food with a Korean and Vietnamese spot added in for variety that reflects the surrounding neighbourhood.

The breakfast parata and puri with eggs and vegetarian thali are a great deal. The complementary tea is a great complement to a very filling breakfast.  Apparently some of the vendors feed the homeless and beggars who come through which is very generous of them."}
{"text":"The best halwa puri in gta by far!!!  Taste is exactly like Karachi\"s halwa puri. Nihari is also very good. Would recommend getting take out the seating area is not the best.?"}
{"text":"Worst halwa poori ever. This place was so bad it doesn't even deserve more words out of my mouth, but here it goes.

Service:
People at the front could care less whether a customer is present at the counter or not. Even though the kitchen is right behind the front counter and the workers are right there, but they do not care. Ordering something from the menu here is like ordering to a statue. Whether or not the statue heard it or not, does it really matter? Because it's a statue!

Cost:
Of course it's 3.99 per plate, it has to be that low for anyone to just enter this Centre and think about attempting to order. If it was one cent too much, you probably wouldn't bat your eye twice at this place.

Ambiance:
It's a run down food court. Hole in the wall.

Halwa poori:
The poori, halwa, Chaney, aloo were Stone cold. The only thing that seemed at the right temperature was the yoghurt, because it was also cold! The aloo and poori seemed like they were 3 days stale.

If you are looking for a place better than here, at a similar price point, please take your business to some place like Zafran. Trust me, you don't want to spend your money here. At least not on halwa poori."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food prices are super cheap and the quantity is good. The food taste could be improved but for the price you pay,  this deserves a five stars from me. 

Their staff is all super fast,  all female.  They grew so much that they acquired another restaurant right next to it. They mainly serve Chinese food at other location and 2.99& for a full breakfast is amazing. 

I would recommend this place to everyone.  I'd you are hungry and short on cash,  this is the best place for you to go eat tasty indiam/Pakistani food."}
{"text":"I tried it 3 years back and found it amazing 
Prices were really economical. Staff is friendly 
They are famous for halwa and puri"}
{"text":"There used to be a time when Jamil and co the owners were courteous and hospitable and the food was good.Now things have taken a turn for the worse, with an exception of Mrs.Jamil personally present there, the other staff that includes Jamil's own sister who is extremely nasty to the customers, the staff is over worked and underpaid.Always frowning at customers.No hygiene.Stale food.Many times I bought sabzi and by the time I reached home in 20 minutes, it went bad.I told them and they are not willing to take liability.Very discourteous and rude staff which is predominantly their own family members.Just peep into the kitchen area and see for yourself the condition of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Shoutout to **Amna F** for the recommendation.I won't be writing a full on review but this place is definitely a hole in the wall.Had halwa puri togo'ed-it was greasy and delicious just how it should be. This place reminded me of Karachi's halwa puri especially the runny cholay curry.I need to try more of their dishes.I will be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*
Every few months, I get a hankering for \"nashta\" - South Asian breakfast. It's unhealthy and cheap, but so satisfying.

I came to Tabaq to satisfy today's craving. I've been here a couple times before - it's located in the basement of Newin Centre. 

This restaurant is easily the busiest in the food court, and I believe today's wait was longer than usual at ~20 minutes.

We ordered 2 nasthas + 1 kebab combo - 
*Poori (deep-fried South Asian bread): You receive 2 per nashta. Tabaq's are less oily than a couple other restaurants so that's a big plus. These were freshly made.
*Aloo (potato) and channa (chickpea) curries: Decent 
*Achaar (pickled veggies/fruits - in this case, onion and mango): Delicious! Strong tang to it, probably the best I've had in a nashta.
*Halwa: Better than average in terms of taste, not a fan of the gelatinous texture though
*Kebab: Taste was good but it was room temperature
*Fries: Also room temperature 

Value is amazing - all of this was for $12 + tax. 3.5 stars since the kebabs were not hot, but rounding up to 4 anyway."}
{"text":"Every time I go to missasaugua/toronto, I have to go to this fast food restaurant. The mall that it is located in is quite dirty, but the food is amazing. It is run by this family that has been working there for years. I've been going here for over a decade. The portions are huge, the food comes out in less than ten minutes, and the flavor is authentic (I am Indian. I believe this family is Pakistani, but I have had my fair share of biriyani at Indian and/or Pakistani restaurants). 

Service is very nice. I always get take out from here as well when I stop in the area."}
{"text":"I usually come here for the kabab combo ($5.99) which comes with kabab, fries, a small salad, sauce, flatbread, and pop. My experiences are usually decent, until today when I came for lunch. I told the cashier my order, she told one of the women in the kitchen to make a kabab combo and told me to wait 5 minutes. 20+ minutes later, I came back up to her and she seemed to have forgotten my order completely. I had to tell her again that I wanted a kabab combo, which did only take 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Great Pakistani food at very good prices. I tried halwa puri and nihari here. Both were awesome"}
{"text":"This is located in the Newin Centre Mall Food Court, one of the most unclean environments. If it wasn't for the food, I wouldn't even give a half star rating.
The food here is just okay, have it only when you run out of options. The Naans, Parathas and Nihari are good, but other stuff is average or below average. They have combo deals with drink included ranging from $4-$8. Few of the ladies staff is friendly. The service time is always a delay, the ladies there will tell you it's going to be only few minutes but will take a while. I was once told Biryani is ready and after cashing out, I waited for closed to half hour. 
The worst part is its location, the smell can suffocate you, my wife and I kept changing tables just to avoid the smell the other vendors. It's really not recommended to go with children, it feels like it's infected. Rather take out and eat at home !
It's famous for its Breakfast/ Nashta of Halwa Puri. No doubt it's good and inexpensive as well, like for $4, you get good quantity. If you are going on weekends, there's a big line up and not much place to sit, you will have to bear the smell while you wait for a seat. Make sure to clean your tables before you sit !
Again to sum it up, choose only when you run out of options and moreover just do take out !!"}
{"text":"I give a 2 star for the food. For the location, I would give a 1.

This is NOT a restaurant. DO NOT go here with family or think that you would get service and a table. This is in the food court of a small shopping center and it's like a hole in the wall. The food here is oily and ok but nothing special. Meh!"}
{"text":"This is located in a shopping mall food court, food wasn't bad at all, absolutely loved their butter chicken and naans, only complaint we had was the food court table and chair, wish they could be cleaned!"}
{"text":"1) ordered 2 butter chicken combos. We waited about 20 minutes and when I came back to check on my order, lady asks \"what did you order again?\" WTF
2) when our order finally came out, she only
gave us one salad despite the fact that we ordered TWO SEPARATE combos. 
3) the salad was so disgusting and old. It looked reused (See photo)
4) i am a huge fan of butter chicken and have went to numerous restaurants and I have to say this was one of the worst places I've ever been to.
5) naan bread was so oily and burnt. And the lady making the naan bread with her bare hands walked out to get something from another store and didn't even wash her hands when she came back and started making more naan bread"}
{"text":"The service has improved since last year.The wait times are still longer but at least the new staff is friendlier.
Food prices are reasonable.Haleem is one of their best foods.Biryani is ok.Kababs they dont know how to make."}
{"text":"Great Indian Pakistani food.  I have only tried the mutton biryani and beef kebabs here, which are really delicious. 

The prices are very reasonable and the serving sizes are extremely generous. Good value here. 

The wait time was only 10 minutes for me,  which was excellent considering it was pretty busy and they are making the rotis after the order. 

Definitely go back if I am in the area."}
