{"text":"Prior to visiting PainBar Madison, I was a little unsure what to expect. I had been to other Paint Studios before, but they always lacked the personality one would expect from an art studio. When we first walked in, we were immediately aided in picking out a canvas, paint colors, and a place to sit. Our waitress was extremely patient and made sure that we had all the painting supplies and drinks that we needed. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that Friday is Open Mic Night. Rather than sitting listening to normal coffee house music, it was nice to have a variety of local artists serenade us as we painted."}
{"text":"Excellent concept. Great pizza, beer selection and atmosphere. You have to check this place out! Bring out your inner artist"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, super friendly staff, they will help you get set up to paint. Good wine."}
{"text":"We went to PaintBar for one of their formal classes on a Friday night. It was great - something different, fun, reasonably priced, good atmosphere. We didn't eat but did get a good bottle of wine. The instructor (Shoes!) was great: patient, friendly, good at explaining the basics. It's particularly helpful when you have someone taking a look at what you're painting and saying \"straighten out this line\" or \"add some more white here.\" We will definitely be back to do a \"freestyle\" class because now I understand the basics and would love to goof around more (or just pop by for a drink because the bartenders are great)."}
{"text":"PaintBar is an exciting new addition to the already broad range of dining and drinking opportunities on Willy St.  Schedule ahead of time for painting lessons, or just drop-in for one of their homemade pizzas, wine, or a selection of bottled craft beers.  Purchase of a canvas includes all the paint and gear you need to get started, and the friendly staff is there to guide you through your artistic endeavor.  

The pizzas come in around 8-9 dollars and are of a personal size; my wife and I shared the margarita and prosciutto pizzas and were well satisfied.  We opted for the smallest canvases to cut our teeth, the 6x6 which is $9 dollars.  There are a number of larger sizes, and price scales accordingly.  Also available are a variety of bottles that have a base coat of white paint that offer a different type of \"canvas\".  

Go check it out, and support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"Had a good time at the paint bar. 

Great location very easy to find. When we first walked in I expected to be greeted right away, I kinda felt lost? Like deer in headlights didn't really kno what to do our where to go. I saw the bar and started heading to it. As I stood there looking like a fool it took a second for one of the girls to ask if we had a reservation which we did. They seated us quickly explained what paint bar is all about and took our orders, they left my boyfriend and I alone so we could get our creative juices flowing? Meh overall it was a good experience, costumers service just wasn't spectacular. It was kinda flat nothing that pushed it over the top. I liked that the paint bar was clean they played great music and the food was great. I really love the concept"}
{"text":"We love this place! We've come here for Valentine's Day my birthday and now our wedding anniversary. This place has so many great things. It's nice and trendy rustic, modern, great music selections, good food and beverage options, patient and lively instructors. Everything you need, whether you're a confident painter or a beginning painter, this is the place to be. 

We had Mallory(I believe her name is) as our instructor. She was down to earth, honest and supportive. There were supposed to be 7 in the class. Usually, when we've gone, there are like 20+ people per class. The group of 5 didn't show up so it was my wife and I and Mallory. The perfect anniversary gift from God. Mallory spent so much time walking us through the painting for the session. She wasn't pushy, she answered questions, she had just the right energy. She was all that for us!

Customer Service is huge in my book, Mallory exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Although they have the typical paint and wine in the back of the studio (where you pay for an instructor to guide you through a step-by-step creation), the front is set up to have people buy blank canvases and paint whatever their hearts desire. Why doesn't Chicago have this yet?! It was awesome!

They have a range of canvas sizes and a multitude of different color paints that they are not stingy about! Cocktails are reasonably priced at about $8, wine for about $6 and beers for around $5. They also offer food and appetizers that smelled incredible!

This was a super low key way to catch up with friends and enjoy some time together. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not enough good things to say about this place! 

First off- you can either take a class and paint by instruction of a teacher OR they have space dedicated to letting your creative juices flow and paint whatever you want. You can pick the size of canvas (and now wood option) and get handed some paint/brushes/easel and do your thing. 

There is a food and drink menu that you can order off while you paint as well. Definite perk! Beer, wine, and cocktail options as well as a variety of food. (Nutella pizza is delicious). 

If you need help, workers will gladly give you pointers or suggestions. 

This place is perfect for a date night or just coming with your friend crew. Everyone always looks happy here. 

Prices are right-check website/Facebook for some deals on certain days. I know they do 1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays and another day is 1/2 price canvases. 

Give PaintBar a try!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on Friday and really enjoyed myself. You can either come in and paint what you want or you can sign up for a class. I went with the former and had a fun time. The manager was really friendly and offered to help. I appreciated that they had a huge selection of drinks, including both local and non-local beers, all types of wine (red, white, and dessert), cocktails, and non-alcoholic drinks. I loved the 2 sodas I bought (root beer and ginger beer). I thought the four cheese sandwich was OK. I am hoping to come back on a Monday when they have free trivia and half-price freestyle painting. They have other specials throughout the week, including half-price bottles of wine on Wednesdays, $3 beers (but I can't remember which day), and $1 off personal pizzas on Fridays. In sum, a really fun place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Last Friday was my first time at Paint Bar Madison and I had a FANTASTIC time! It was affordable, fun, tasty - an all around grand night out for me and five girlfriends. I would highly recommend it. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the prices. I have been to paint night classes that were $40+. The canvas, paints, and staff expertise ranged in price from $9-22. Food and drink prices were reasonable as well. Pizza and a drink for $12. 

Paint Bar offers freestyle - what we did - just call in to reserve a table. Or, they offer classes as well. Check their website for details. I highly recommend Shoes (yup, that is his name), a very knowledgeable and helpful staff. He was super attentive and offered paining advice that made all our projects better. 

And, at the end of the evening you can take your extra paint and paint on the wall. DO check out Paint Bar!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took her parents, her brother, and his son to PaintBar over the holiday weekend.  She has done this sort of thing at other venues, but I hadn't put paint on anything but a wall in longer than I care to mention.

We all had a great time.  Our youngest was 11 and oldest were in their 70's, so this really is something the whole family can enjoy together.  I know, \"bar\" is in the name of the establishment, but it's as family friendly as any place you'll go on a Saturday late morning/early afternoon.  Speaking of the bar, there's a nice selection of craft bottles along with wines and other libations.  We had lunch plans after, but the pizza menu looked good and the pizza that was cooking for other guests smelled delicious.

Cory, our artist in residence (not sure of his official title but I like that one) was very helpful and made it a lot of fun.  Along with our wide range of ages, our group varied widely in painting experience & location along the focused/laid back spectrum, and he had great tips for everyone.  

I have to admit, I wasn't quite sure this would be my thing, but now I'm looking forward to going back.  You're not going to see my work at Sotheby's any time soon, but this is a really fun activity that's highly engaging and relaxing at the same time.  Channel your inner Bob Ross and come in and paint!"}
{"text":"$15 for the express class is very worth! Our class turned out to be just us 3 so it was like a private session! Our instructor was great and very laid back. She showed us the right brush strokes to make and reminded us to always water our brushes after! 

This, a glass of wine, and some of the alfredo prosciutto pizza was a perfect girls outing!"}
{"text":"Perfect addition to Madison!

Ever wanted to do one of those Paint Nite events but it was too expensive, didn't work with your calendar or you didn't like the painting they were offering? You can walk into PaintBar at any time and paint any picture without paying the class fee.

They have instructions you can use but Shoes, the owner (I think), will help you create any masterpiece! He helped my non-artistic group of friends turn our respective ideas into reality. All you need to do is buy a canvas and they supply the paint, clean up and advice for free. 

They offer wine, beer and pizza as well. I was so pleasantly surprised by how delicious the arugula, pancetta and honey goat cheese pizza is! Perfect for when your paint is drying and you need something to do with your hands.

The space is also really neat and they plan to start hosting all kinds of events. Hoping they do well because I anticipate this being the perfect winter activity. Bring the kids, come here on a date or for a tipsy Saturday night with friends - PaintBar would be fun for anyone!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the first time during \"Walking in a Willy Wonderland\", a holiday walk with luminaria in the Willy Street area last night to promote local business. They had a lovely little special offer -- paint a tiny canvas for one dollar or three dollars, to use for a Christmas tree ornament. I felt that this was very low commitment and time investment, so I got sucked in. I completely ignored the fact that low time investment is *never* a thing with me and art projects. But it was surprisingly very relaxing and fun. I will definitely go back another time. The bartenders were so friendly and complimentary, and I got to watch a painting class in session being done for a private party. I felt oddly like I was back in third grade art class at Sandberg Elementary, which was the best part of life back then, doing projects with Mr. Jacoby. I had always wondered if painting in public with strangers would be stressful for those of us with perfectionistic tendencies, but I didn't feel that way at all. Four stars only because the brushes are in truly horrible condition. If this matters to you, you might want to bring your own."}
{"text":"Decent food, awsome music and fun time painting....I Almost feel like an artist after one evening with the brush and canvas :p...The band that was performing were exceptionally good, kudos to their GOT title track performance....evening well spent."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff and lovely atmosphere. Best of all, affordable! For less than $20, I got a canvas, paint, and a beer. It was a perfect way to relax on a Sunday evening. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for paint, drinks and food and the music. My only complaint the food could have arrived faster. Overall a worthy experience and it's more fun when you go as a group!"}
{"text":"I've been in to the paint bar a few times now. Overall, it is a pretty enjoyable and fun activity, and I would recommend it if you're looking for something to do. 

My first time here was not actually to paint at all. I came in to look at the space to see if they would be able to accommodate a large group for a work event I was coordinating. We like to find fun team building/bonding activities that help to break up the 3 or 4 days of non-stop (as it seems) work. I was given a tour of the space and shown a pretty cool back area that we decided would work well for the group. They serve food and drinks here, so I made sure to ask and verify that they would have staffing available to keep up with the groups demands. It was a large group, so I anticipated there would be a large amount of food and drink consumed. They assured me it would be no problem.

Unfortunately this was not so. Although everyone reported having a great time painting and chatting, many of them stated they left hungry and had to find somewhere to else to eat afterward. Being that many of these folks were from out of town, without transportation of their own, that can be a challenge. They said the food they did get was great, but there was not nearly enough. It wasn't being produced or prepared at a fast enough rate. That was a bummer to hear and I felt bad.

I have returned since, but not in a group - I did a class here with a friend. The class was fun and I enjoyed painting with others. I am a painter myself, though I rarely work with acrylics, or brushes even, so I still found it to be a informative and engaging activity. The drinks were good, the service was good, and our instructor was lively and upbeat. 

At the end of the day, here's what I think: Good food, good service, fun activity. If planning for a group, keep your group somewhat small. I wouldn't recommend relying on the menu offered as your dinner, but more of a snack."}
