{"text":"this strip mall probably has two of the worst restaurants in all of ontario.  paul wongs chinese (see my review) and Kathryn's.  My mom once again suggested this for lunch and i even mentioned wow it;s in the same strip plaza as paul wongs we had gone to for lunch many years ago that quite frankly was the worst chinese food i ever had.  Could it get any worse. YES it can, Kathryn's is a diner (where the bar part in title comes from don't know, there isn't a bar per se to sit at).  It's complete 80\"s pastel decor, which would be ok if the place was clean and the food tolerable.  Why do people buy a restaurant that was great based on food ( used to be greek owners who knew the food business) if they have no clue first of all how to run a restaurant and second no idea what the food they are cooking should taste like or even have a clue what it is.  The order:  fish and chips:  frozen fish (asked waitress said it was fresh)  captain high liner type of concoction with fries i think they cooked yesterday and saved them to re-fry.  The fries tasted like fish, so that would say the oil in deep fryer was dirty.  Chicken Souvalki on pita with fries, this was the absolute worse meal i think I've had ever and ever.  Rubbery chicken pieces on a stale pita with iceberg lettuce and a few slivers of tomato.  The poor waitress, (whom i tipped generously) was not in the dark about the quality of food she KNOWS it' s horrendous.   We spoke to the owner Sophie and she discounted our bill $5 even though we didn't eat merely a bite.  STAY away."}
{"text":"Loved this place until I asked the waitress if I could have tomatoes instead of the customary fries with my breakfast.  She checked and they said \"no\". My God, the difference is a benefit to them. Oh well, I will be going to Ted's in West Hill instead."}
{"text":"A great place to go for breakfast.  Service is fast and friendly.  Eggs are exactly the way you like them.  Top two breakfast restaurants in Pickering."}
{"text":"My family goes here for the breakfast / brunch on weekends. It is a great little joint that isn't a multi-national corporation or big chain. And yet... this place attracts a crowd.   The proof is in the pudding. They have great food at reasonable prices. The home fries are awesome as are the omelettes. When I used to eat meat (and my family still does to confirm this) they made a great back bacon. In fact, this is the main reason my mom and dad keep going back. And then as you go, you develop relationships with the waitresses etc and then this place just feels like home.   My favourite thing is to have a hearty meal here after walking through the rouge park located near by.   Other perks is that your cup is always full and the service is great."}
{"text":"We were just here the other day and I noticed that they have added eggs benedict to their menu for $9.99.  Since my hope had been restored, after trying the eggs benedict at another restaurant in the area, I figured I'd give it a shot.  Oh no. No, no, no.  I was served three eggs on two english muffins with peameal bacon and a side of home fries.  The eggs were cooked hard and were smothered in a hollandaise sauce that tasted as though it was made with oil from the deep fryer and a whole whack of salt. It was separating before my eyes!  If you could get passed the amount of salt on the home fries, the potatoes themselves didn't have much flavour however, there was that all-too-familiar taste of deep fryer oil that I guess tied the whole dish together.  I'm leaving this restaurant as a 3 star because I truly do like going here for their fish 'n chips and burgers but this dish was a colossal fail."}
