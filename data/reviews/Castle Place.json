{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese restaurant around. They have large portions with reasonable prices. The restaurant itself is small but it packs a punch. They have great Chinese food along with some great Thai choices. Highly recommend this place. Friendly and fast services.

Recommended choice: Hunan beef along with the House Special Soup"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food!!! Good delivery service, just love it!"}
{"text":"Castle Place is your standard take-out-only Chinese restaurant. The location is a little bit run down, and I expected the food to be pretty bad, but my wife and I were sick of Sesame Inn and decided to try something new. Overall the food is hit or miss--some nights are better than others, probably depending on which member of the family that owns the place is cooking--but when it's good it's really very good. Good: We particularly like the General Tso's tofu, which has a great texture. Bad: The pot-stickers are often under-fried."}
{"text":"This is strictly a take out and delivery Chinese restaurant. There's no dining in the restaurant. 

I ordered dinner here and decided to try the General Tso chicken since it was favorably mentioned in other reviews. 

The menu is pretty standard Chinese fare with a few Thai dishes. 

I ordered in person instead of calling in the order. The lady at the counter was friendly. The food came out in about 10 minutes as she had stated it would.

They give you a large serving which was really enough for two people. This dish, which I don't think I've had before, consisted of deep fried pieces of breaded chicken that are soaked in a sauce, which was supposed to be spicy but to my tastes was more sweet than spicy. I'm not fond of sweet main courses so probably would try something different. It came with steamed rice, and thankfully they didn't give me an over generous quantity of the rice. 

This is a decent place if you're in the neighborhood and want Chinese take out. The price was about standard--$10.50 for the General Tso chicken."}
{"text":"After moving to a new neighborhood, we started looking for a new Chinese take out place.  We tried Castle Place, and it was good.  The delivery is always pretty quick, and the food is always decent.  The crab rangoons are sweeter, and ok.  My hubby loves the General Tso's, I am still looking for something that is consistently good that I like.

Overall, not bad for a little take-out place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend their General Tso's Ck! Best ever! Friendly service with a smile. Tho no dinning in, take out and delivery only. Great meal for Pittsburgh sports games and Game of Thrones night!!! :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. No it's not the Sesame Inn, which is good as well, but this take out only family run restaurant has never served us a bad meal in the 14 years we've been going to it!"}
{"text":"Note #1: Castle Place Chinese Cuisine sits in the small Castle Place shopping plaza. It's next-door neighbor is Nick's Pizza. Hence, the name.

Note #2: They also offer a small selection of Thai entrees. 

Another trip out to this end of Mount Lebanon resulted in a take-home meal from this tiny, scantily-decorated, almost-nowhere-to-sit Chinese restaurant, and the results were fairly middling. 

A obligatory helping of fried dumplings, that appetizer Kay and I cannot get enough of,  began this insurance seminar of a dinner. They were doughy, somewhat stingy in terms of pork filling, and overall, were unexciting. 

I came close to ordering Thai, but decided against it since I wasn't eating at a Thai restaurant, so I randomly went with an item called Capital Chicken.

A rank-and-file dish centered around battered, fried chicken breast strips, a slew of vegetables and a \"brown\" sauce \"complimented it, leaving my palate bored. 

This is why I'm tiring of Chinese or at least the \"Americanized\" variety:  Everything I seem to order of late contains a protein, a sauce, and some vegetables in some sort of mildly-differing configuration. No matter how exotic it sounds, it turns out to be something I've had before under a different name. 

I want something new in my Chinese excursions. Castle Place doesn't have it. 

Perhaps I should have just stuck with General Tso's. It may not be authentic (who cares?), but I'll be damned if it isn't universally good no matter where I have it. That's what I get for trying to be adventurous: Capital Chicken. 

P.S. The service was really friendly, and like many Asian restaurants around town, there are always adorable children about the place doing homework or showing off their toys."}
