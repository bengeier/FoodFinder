{"text":"Open late night apparently, as we were caught in traffic and decided to venture off the beaten path.  Apparently a \"hot spot\" during the daytime hours... But we appreciated it, fast, tasty and exactly what we wanted!  Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever!  Nasty inside.  Unsure of lady that worked there. Definite skip!"}
{"text":"best chili dogs anywhere. You might sit next to someone with 90 pierceings, a biker,a nun  or a auy in a three piece suit. But everyone gets along with each other they are just here for thebest hot dog in Cleveburg. Try a chili dog with stadium mustard, relish, andonion. The best time to go is after the bars close. They are open till 3 A. M. on weekends. At this time the dogs have been simmering on the grill since noon.  The cheapest and best meal you can get. Also a great greasy and satisfying breakfast can be had at 1960 prices."}
{"text":"I've always known this place as the Hot Dog Inn or HDI. It is a shrine to all that is great about Cleveland - simple, good, a tad grimy and shady, stadium mustard, cheap.  Before you leave downtown after jostling with all the d-bags in the Warehouse District or Ohio City, order a few chili dogs and a Lake Erie Highball before you drive the gauntlet of suburban cops looking to pin a dui on you.  I first ate at the HDI in 1977 and it has hardly changed.  My father started eating there in the late 50's, and he says it hasn't changed since then either.  Gladly, they haven't fixed what has never been broken."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in town. Family owned and operated. The perfect pitstop after you've had a few beers or on your way home from work. A must for the Cleveland experience."}
{"text":"I came back here again. This diner is the best. No fufu wine sippers here, just honest hot dogs. I feel like there is something good about this place they never changed for the last 50 years. Can you say that about many other restaurants? I had one with chili and one with sauerkraut. Chili cheese fries too and a Dr pepper. When I tasted the first dog, I knew there was a good honest meal here. The fries are to die for. I'll be back for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A piece of history and literally a \"Hole in the wall\" but a great deal for the money and worth the price for the chili dogs. Had the fries too and really it's about the chili dogs!"}
{"text":"My dad used to bring hot dogs home from the Hot Dog Inn when we were kids!  They had the BEST hot dogs I have ever eaten.  I live in Florida now and just wish we could get them down here.  If you ship, let me know!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this area of Lorain in west cleveland.....shady, but it has two awesome hot dog joints that are open very late.  GOOD STUFF:  Tons of history here just like Steve's down the road.  Good hot dogs and chili for cheap- dirt cheap.  They are almost always open- one time I showed up there at 2am and they were just getting ready to close.  BAD STUFF:  A bit divey- even more than other hot dog joints.  The area is shady so be smart.  PRICE:  10 bucks for two   OVERALL:  Another great hot dog joint in Cleveland- very good after a night out but a bit one the dive side of things....."}
{"text":"no, i don't want to know what's on the floor or anything.  and yeah, you could call this little place a dive.  but they make a damn good hot dog.  and a mean grilled cheese. good and cheap eats.  open late night, this is the best place to go when you and your friends just don't know what to do, and someone randomly says \"HOT DOGS!!\"  maybe your friends don't do that. maybe you don't have friends. well, if you don't, mine will gladly accompany you to old fashion hot dogs at 2 am.  i just don't want to know what's behind the curtain, great and wonderful oz.  i just don't want to know."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, but for the fourth star to sneak in, I'll have to try something other than a chili dog.   My chili dog was great with a little bit of Frank's hot sauce--we tried to the chili cheese fries after being coaxed by a customer at the other end of the counter. Definitely a good suggestion! Delicious! I love hot dogs and there's really no way to screw them up for me. I can't wait to come back and try one with kraut.  As far as the atmosphere goes, I was surprised to walk into such a tiny little place and immediately thrilled with the unique environment. The staff is sooo friendly and welcoming.  Remember to bring your cash! This joint isn't messing around with plastic!"}
{"text":"Had a very simple yet tasty meal here at the old, iconic Cleveland diner-style spot.  As many others have pointed out, this is a teeny-tiny shop with a grill up front (where the magic happens!), fryers and other supplies in the back and counter service for about 6-8 people.  The owner was super-friendly helping out those of us seated (along with his waitstaff) and also addressing incoming orders from the folks walking in for takeout.  There are more than hot dogs on the menu, but being my first time I thought I'd better try their \"signature\" products.  The hot dogs I ordered had a nice flattop char to them and a good snap.  I chose one chili cheese dog with mustard and onions, and another topped with cole slaw.  Their chili had a strong taste / scent of cinnamon, but it went well with the other flavors on the dog, like the raw onions and hint of yellow mustard.  My second dog came out with sauerkraut on it (instead of cole slaw), but I ate it anyway...will save that slaw dog for another trip!  Dirt cheap meal with friendly service to boot...there will no doubt be a return trip."}
{"text":"I took a road trip from the east coast to the west coast and came across this spot so i went in for some chili, I wasn't disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Go to this one versus Steve's! It's not much cleaner here but the staff working there at least have a little personality first off and the food isn't nearly as gross....regardless of how sanitary you think it is or isn't here. I mean it's a hot dog shop. Hot dogs aren't necessarily fine food but can be delicious when one is drunk or hung over or just in the mood. No one expects miracles...or shouldn't."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem with my wife after just recently moving to Cleveland and i must say this place is my top favorite place to eat the workers are extremely polite and the food is amazing especially there burgers and fries and the prices you cant beat definatly worth checking out"}
{"text":"Mind you.... it's an old fashioned diner.... that makes it interesting. ..not many seats....the food sucks....you could make a better hot dog on your stove....or 7 11"}
{"text":"The best hot dogs in town. Period. Owners and staff are amazing. These are the hot dogs dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Quick service, nice diner atmosphere, and friendly staff. Very average hotdogs - inexpensive."}
{"text":"Old Fashion Hot Dogs is comfort food for me. This place hits the spot after a night out at W. 25th. It's a no frills, whatever diner, but it always come through like a good friend.  Best Advice: Order the chili dogs and drive home safe."}
{"text":"I was looking up some of the old restaurants that I loved as a kid and this was one of them! I can't believe it's still there!! My Stepdad would always stop on Friday after work ( he worked nights) and bring chili dogs home. They were the best!!  That was 60 years sgo!! I moved south 20 years ago and  I really think I'm going to have to make a trip to Cleveland this summer!!  I also loved Royal Castle hamburgers and Birch Beer, served in a frosted glass mug, yum!!They were located on Lorain Ave Close to Fulton Rd.  Cleveland is a great city."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place for the first time today.  The hot dogs are your fairly average grilled dogs.  The buns?  Commercial.  Kind of stale.  The kraut?  Average at best.  This place truly wins with its homemade chili, though.  Get a chili dog and you definitely won't be disappointed.  I'm looking forward to going back for a whole bowl of the stuff during the winter.  Plus, this is the cheapest, fastest meal I've ever had. The dogs were all $1-$2 and just about everything on the menu is in that price range.  We'll definitely stop there again before or after going to the West Side Market."}
{"text":"People who like restaurants talk about the \"atmosphere,\" by which they mean elegant carpets and pretty windows and smartly-dressed waiters.    But there is another type of atmosphere: steel grates on the door, ready to be locked, a counter grimed with a fine patina of cigarettes and spilled coffee, Xeroxed notes taped to the fridge that tell the customers they'll be tossed out if they're too much trouble.  A menu on a chalkboard that hasn't changed in the better part of a decade.  A beefy guy slapping dogs on a grill, debating with his friends in between sizzles, asking you gruffly, \"Whaddayou want?\" - not meanly, but hey, you're here to eat, he wants to serve you, he's got other customers.    That's REAL atmosphere, buddy.  To hell with your fancy-shmancy tablecloths; gimme real grease and real bread and a real grill.    This place is alive, and will fill up your belly for the price of what you can scrape out of your car's change dish at one in the morning after you left your wallet behind at the bar, I think, I dunno man, it's a good night, let's get some damned eggs.    They have a grilled cheese sandwich for three bucks with real crispy bacon, and melted cheese, and God lemme tellya for all of its froo-froo avocado-and-dried-tomato grilled cheese goodness, Melt can go jump out of a window.  This is the real grilled cheese deal.  It's diner food, a small menu, but after a night chugging beers and socializing with friends you can come here and sit on the damn stools and feel like yeah, this is life.  It's good.  Gimme a Pepsi."}
{"text":"Killer staff. Killer chili. Chili Cheese Fries are pretty ripzilla. I choose this place over Steve's ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. Breakfast Sandwiches are on top of the mountain."}
{"text":"Out for a quick lunch and found this place. Man was it a good choice!! Had 4 of their special chili dogs."}
{"text":"A great hotdog. The place has survived many years and it taste the same as 30 years ago. I love the chili Dog!"}
{"text":"This is just a classic hot dog counter place. The buns and dogs are run-of-the-mill... it's the chili that makes this place great. Most places like this just open a can of Hormel (or at least it tastes like it). Here you get a flavorful, Greek-style chili with an interesting flavor profile. Plus, it's cheap and still open after the bars close."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner so it was a no brainer for lunch today...I'm a bit disappointed actually. First of all, the setting is fine, it's small and quiet, maybe 6 bar stools NO tables, it's really tiny inside. It's divey but good divey, it has a classic touch to it, original, untarnished. They don't take credit Cash only. I ordered a chili cheese dog and some cheese fries and much to my dismay the lady in there literally took shredded cheese out of a bin and sprinkled it on both my hotdog and fries, the cheese didn't even melt. I'm a cheese fry fan so this upset me. But alas the food made up for the appearance, the hot dogs snap when you bite into them, that's a sign the skin is perfect for me. The fries were nice and hot and salty, kind of thin but that's what shoestring fry lover are for right? All in all I recommend, and I hope the next time I go I can get my cheese melted."}
{"text":"This was everything I could have asked for on a late Wednesday night....and Thursday night!! I'm not from the area but a native suggested we stumble down to the hotdog spot on the corner. Great decision. I had two chili, slaw, onion, and stadium mustard and one kraut dog with onions and stadium mustard. The slaw is a perfect creamy consistency and the chili has a bit more liquid but you eat everything so fast that the bun is a non issue. Hands down the stadium mustard takes everything to the next level. I'm excited to go back and try a double bacon grilled cheese!!! And maybe a chili, kraut, onion, slaw, and stadium mustard dog. I believe I paid around $3 for the loaded dogs. Service was great, timely and prepared basically in front of you. My suggestion...go nuts, you will come out with a full belly and a pocket full of cash. And I'm not 100% but it may be cash only. Hope someone can advise."}
{"text":"Great fresh/hot/chili hot dogs!  Loved the atmosphere-vintage vibe.  Great service and lovely staff. Got to meet Master Thomas Spiro-what an inspiration!!  The whole family loves Cwd it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after sampling beer at Platform Brewery. This is no frills classic counter service at its best. The chili dog special (3 for $5) was a steal. Chili dogs come with chili (made with a recipe pushing 100 years old), onions, and yellow mustard. Delicious. Next time I'm Cleveland I will be stopping here. Owners were super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"A cleveland staple  great deals  Great chili dogs  tremendous atmosphere  perfect for children  so much flavor"}
{"text":"Tasty little hotdog dive! Cheap and delicious! Got the chilli cheese with slaw and chilli cheese dog. Very filling. Fast service. Cash only."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the old Genies Wienies back in Detroit near Hamtramck, MI. Chili is almost the same. Old school whole in the wall diner with great, hot grub, great coffee, chili, friendly service. Loraine Ave near west 41st street. Been in business nearly 100 years, formerly Hot Dog Inn until about 1976. You'll love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is classic Cleveland.  Poor, rich, whatever...they make you feel welcome and also like you've been transported through time (although nothing looks like it did when installed probably 50 years ago).  It's been some time since I've been back, but when I am in Cleveland this is THE place to get a chili dog, bar none.  I live in Chicago and the places here don't touch the chili dog at Hot Dog Inn.    I was introduced to this place in the 80s as a kid by my dad who used to go there as a kid.  I have fond memories of going to this place.  We even got take out in a limo once which I think probably doesn't happen often in this joint.    We usually get a box of 10-20 or everyone and I've never had anyone I've taken there say they don't like it.  Area is a little on the sketchy side, particularly if you don't know the west side of Cleveland.    Love this place."}
{"text":"Chili Dogs with Mustard, Onions, Cheese, and Coleslaw is my go-to hot dog here!  The employees are friendly, the service is great, and bring your cash since they don't take American Express...or Visa or MasterCard or Discover!"}
{"text":"Service was confused.  Place is the epitome of hole in the wall,  desperately needing some tlc. Staff was friendly.  Quality of hot dogitself was ok... Small,  not great,  not bad. Didn't taste like 100% beef.   Chili had a cinnamon flavor,  was reasonable,  but a bit gritty and lacking richness. The price is the main feature,  but if you can wait until after 4:30, I'd go to happy dogs instead."}
{"text":"My favorite style of old school hot dog joints. Had the chili dog with mustard and onions. The chili sauce was a little bland and the dog was small for the roll but the service and the atmosphere made this place. Hats off to place like this that's open late. Thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"Pete is amazing and makes anyone feel like family. This place is a great find! Looks dodgy but the food is great. They even offer tofu dogs for vegetarians. A must stop for backpackers. Be sure to bring cash as they don't take cards."}
{"text":"I love the guy who works here, possibly the owner?  The food was good and very reasonably priced.  It was late before we stopped moving into a new home and the whole atmosphere was kinda cool."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a late night snack after the bars.I had the chili dogs,they were damn good.The guys were all very friendly and you could tell they loved what they did!"}
{"text":"I will drive 30 minutes to eat their hot dogs (plural) with chili and homemade coleslaw. I don't even like coleslaw, but this stuff is heavenly. A no-frills, tiny diner that is clean and the food is cheap! If you want fancy/outrageous toppings head to Happy Dog. If you want friendly service and simple, delicious dogs, this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for! It was like going back in time... Friendly & delicious."}
{"text":"Wow this joint lives up to the hype and all the good word of mouth. Good old fashioned -deluxe, with homemade slaw!- hotdog, and real, I mean REAL good fries.  $3 for the dog and $1.75 for fries. As others have noted, no frills feed that is incredible value, and I'm glad we went here on our first visit to Cleveland. I wish we could have tried their brekky as well, but next time!"}
{"text":"The diner has been revived in many places, but the counter?  The counter has almost disappeared from the American landscape.  Almost.  But not quite.    Old Fashion Hot Dogs consists of a counter with 12 or 15 stools, enough space for people to to shuffle past those who have claimed those stools, and the grill.    If you're looking for fine dining, you're in the wrong place.  But if you're looking for the best chili fries in town, a grilled cheese sandwich, or the titular dog (with chili, if you're wise), this is your place.  A plate of chili fries consists of a three or four dozen thin, crispy fries and a ladle of thick, spicy chili.  All for 10 bits - $2.50 for those of you not in the know.  It's not a gigantic plate of food: it's just the right amount of food.  And you aren't paying a Yuppie foodstamp ($20, for those of you not in the know) for more food than you need.    Bottom line?  This is the place to go after an evening of drinking.  It's not pretty, but it's tasty and cheap.  You can show up in torn jeans, in a tuxedo, or in drag, and the guys behind the counter won't blink.  Just tell them what you want.  They don't care about your life story.  Here's your food.  I haven't tried the breakfast menu, but it's a long list of fine, greasy food.  Brilliant."}
{"text":"The absolute nicest owners that you could ask for. I ordered a grilled cheese and they apologized profusely that I'd waited 3 minutes before t was served. 3 MINUTES? I'd wait that long for perfection, which is what this sandwich was. And the chili was AMAZING. Good people, good food."}
{"text":"Hot dog was so so at best. Atmosphere was definitely vintage. Neat place & people. But more for a late night drunken food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are in town visiting family and our Airbnb is right around the corner. After driving by a few times he convinced me to check it out. We walked in sat at the counter, and ordered some chili cheese dogs. Service was great (Tom and Vern were fun to talk to) food hit the spot and the price was even better."}
{"text":"Best chili dogs in the city. Whether your getting a midnight snack with friends or getting some food after a few beers, the dogs are amazing. The works with cheese or the Deluxe with krout and slaw amazing dogs and great people.....my old man went there as a kid and still goes, and ive gone since ive been a kid. Definitely a Cleveland Landmark"}
{"text":"We were so excited to finally stop by the neighborhood gem as we always pass it by! We were thrilled to be so impressed. Upon arriving, we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar (the place is pretty small), and the owners greeted us immediately. They are so super sweet and attentive, we had a nice time just talking with them. They have large menu, but really we only snacked on a couple chili cheese hot dogs, which were so good and inexpensive. We will definitely be stopping by many more times! Hole in the wall and totally worth a pit stop!"}
{"text":"Oh baby. If I was an urban planner (the worst folk song title ever BTW), I would mandate that a place like this be on at least every other block. It's a tiny diner that only offers a few items, but it is really, really, really good at those items. As you may have heard, these are absolutely the best chili dogs in town. When you need a quick lunch, or you're in search of decent, non-run-for-the-border late-night munchies, hit this place up."}
{"text":"Ever since Steves Lunch went kaput I had to find another source for my chili dog fix.  Been here more in last 2 months than I have in the last 10 years.  Good people and good dogs.  Cheap and will give you some base after ya start drinking beers at Platform across the street at 10am.  Always good people watching and the owner dude will have ya in-and-out faster than the chili will leave your colon..."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid. Love this place! Always get two chili cheese dogs and chili cheese fries. And the grilled cheese with bacon and egg is also great. Little diner not too fancy but the food is delish so it doesn't matter. Come try them out!"}
{"text":"A squashed, majestic night owl's haven, Old Fashion Hot Dogs is the quintessential soused food stopover on one's leisurely way to whiskey troubled dreams sprawled on a broken box spring. The restaurant itself is comprised of a polished ancient counter (one imagines Bukowski or even Burroughs posted up here, gabbing over oily coffee and smokes) with barely a few feet of space on either side, and a rabbit-eared TV howling static ceaselessly in one corner. Hungry patrons sidle up and smash together like condiments in a narrow bun, as one of two meat (and veggie dog) purveyors work the grill on the other side. The food is stunningly affordable and fulfilling, served on small white sandwich plates. The veggie dogs have no right to taste as good as they do, given their proportions (scant--not anything akin our ol' friend the Field Roast), their simple ingredients, and their rudimentary presentation (Happy Dog this is not--check your fruit loop craving at the door). Somehow, however, against the odds, they are most exceptional. The banter of the two owners is an added treasure, as well. Caution, however, this is a cash only establishment. Scrounge together a few dollars before arriving. You won't need much. Prepare. Consume. You'll soon float off into rich, warm dreams of unforgettable midnight deliciousness."}
{"text":"Really really sweet owner, especially considering we stopped in at 2:30AM when they had essentially closed shop. I thought though, since their closing time is 3AM, that they would still have delicious hot dog making supplies on hand. They did not! Regardless, they supplied us with what they could. Ended up with many orders of fries and a few hot dog orders with a number of topping combinations including chili, cheese, relish, onion, mustard/ketchup/mayo. The actual size of the wiener was pretty skinny. Plus, perhaps most important to note, the chili for the hot dog had flavors reminding me of Skyline Chili. So if you don't like that Cincinnati style chili, don't order that on your dog.   This place is the epitome of hole-in-the-wall, and I loved it. You walked through the door into the only seating available: bar. You can watch them assemble your hot dog right in front of you! I'm shocked that more people don't come closer to their closing time. But really... Maybe they should have all their ingredients in stock still if they are going to be open so late. I semi-enjoyed my hot dog and I will be back, but I can really only give 3 stars since I didn't experience their full flavor potential. Definitely can see this place turning into a 4 or 5 star though."}
{"text":"My dad started taking me here when I was a kid...I thought it was called the HOT DOG INN...that's what he called it.  Anyway, the place is a dive.  The neighborhood is stank, the block it's on is seedy as hell, but DAMN they make the best chili dog EVER!  Even my wife-- a snob when it comes to diner food and seedy areas-- RAVED about the chili dog.  Hell, she had just bought a juicer to make this cucumber/spinach/apple concoction to stay healthy.  Well f---k that, go get you some dogs at this place!!"}
{"text":"I'd take this place over Happy Dog any day. I walked in hella late, about 15 minutes before their closing time and they were incredibly friendly and still down to serve me hot dogs. Did the $5 deal. They weren't what I was expecting - the dogs themselves are small and I easily put down three of 'em and was wanting three more. Coming from Texas, the chili was unlike any I had ever had before and was somewhat watery but still a nice consistency and with incredible flavor. The decor rules. One of those places that looks like they never updated it which is a fantastic thing for a restaurant with such a simple food and menu. It felt home-y. Happy Dog is cool, but this trumps it by far for it's simplicity, vibe, and flavor that hasn't changed in 80 years."}
{"text":"Best chili dogs. No fuss. When I'm not eating pasta and sushi I'll be here getting 4-6 chili dogs at a time. Chili cheese fries are also excellent. Either you \"get it\" or you don't and sometimes after a long day of making fancy expensive food this is the only thing that can hit the spot."}
{"text":"Our grandfather Kenny Will came to this same spot since before WWII. It's a neighborhood staple that we enjoyed visiting when we visited from Seattle. It was some of our best memories with Gramp. Chili dogs and the works.... I could eat at least three of them plus a bowl of chili in one sitting. Wash it down with a Coke, and you're satisfied. It's definitely a dive, and a bit sketchy, but it's awesome for townies and out-of-towners alike."}
{"text":"Sometimes you have a craving for something Old Fashion. Sure, you'll probably come by here for late night eats - it's cheap, open for business when you need it to be, no frills and gets the job done. I once came in for a quick lunch and had a nice conversation with the lady serving that afternoon. We were the only ones in the place and she showed me some newspaper clippings and gave a little history lesson regarding this establishment. Once you hear stories of people who come over from another country and start an endeavour, it can only be commended. It hasn't grown much, if any, since the early days, but Old Fashion never intended to be this glitzy establishment. Get your chili dogs (3 for $5!), take in the surroundings and have fun!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a late night snack.  They offer tofu options so a great place to bring vegetarian friends.  The chili cheese and coleslaw dogs are my staple. The chili cheese fries are also amazing especially when you ask them to make the fries well done.   If you've never been before i highly recommend it if you want to experience a bit of the real Cleveland.   Seats 9-10 people at a lunch bar."}
{"text":"Total dive - aren't those the best? I was delighted to spot the sign driving past and happened to catch a glimpse of the old school (read not rehabbed, same as it ever was) counter and stools. The staff was friendly as were the fellow late night patrons enjoying their dogs. Chili cheese dog and fries anyone? Bring cash. This isn't the sort of place that would be accepting credit cards."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs. This is a must visit restaurant in Cleveland. I first came here after some weird shows at Speak In Tongues. Weird days and nights."}
{"text":"Been going here since childhood, always on a Sunday after my father went to pioneer savings and loan to deposit checks. He would also bring an entire tray home of them from time to time.  Its got that classic grimy hole in the wall effect, like you may not make it out alive during later hours, but its what we all love when going to \"THE HOT DOG INN\".   I personally stopped eating hot-dogs on a regular basis to try to be a bit healthier, but this place has great chilli dogs no doubt, and would always get a chocolate milk when sitting at the counter with the pops.  Never saw what steve's lunch had on these guys, personally always thought this was better.  I feel my vote was generous, and I want to give a 5+ star due to nostalgia, but we are talking hot-dogs here, and I don't think I can vote \"wooho! As good as it gets!\""}
{"text":"Simply put, this is my favorite place to go for a hot dog. They have unbelievable chili that compliments the dog perfectly. The only problem is space, as there are only about 8 stools in the place. Other than that it is delicious and affordable. A true Cleveland landmark."}
{"text":"I took a road trip from the east coast to the west coast and came across this spot so i went in for some chili, I wasn't disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Been visiting this location for 20+ years (mind you I'm only 26 as I write this!), and it has been amazing every single time!  Their chili dogs are hands down the BEST I've ever had (the only chili I've ever had that came close was Blue Ash Chili down in Cincinnati), the staff is great, and you really just can't beat a great hole-in-the-wall location for a midnight chili dog!"}
{"text":"The staff sets this place ahead of anyone else. They're extremely friendly and enjoy getting to know their customers. They take the time to talk to you and and make you feel comfortable. Everyone was sweet and full of that Midwestern charm.   The place itself is small, just the stoves and the bar. But that adds to the charm. It feels like you're part of the neighborhood even if you're a first time visitor.   Food is cheap and simple but that's the whole point. You can go in get a classic grilled cheese and hot dogs for under $10."}
{"text":"Solid dogs. Recommend you go straight from the airport. I did."}
{"text":"Great place with great hot dogs and fries. This is definitely an old fashion place and has that feel. The workers are nice and you get your hot dog right away. Just bar stool seating with one two chair table in the back. The fries are similar McDonalds and are freshly made. The chili may not be for everyone but I would say most people like it."}
