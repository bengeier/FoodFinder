{"text":"Grande déception. Une grande salle fraîchement agrandie bondée de gens semblant satisfaits. Toutefois, la cuisine offerte par ce restaurant est très ordinaire.  Sincèrement, pour la moitié du prix et plus de goût vous pouvez facilement trouver mieux ailleurs."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with friendly service and good prices. Dishes are tasty and satisfying yet light. The eggrolls taste like the ones my mother makes. A must try!"}
{"text":"Great little gem in Brossard in a sea of Asian fare restaurants in the area. This resto specializes in Thai & Cambodian cuisine. I ordered a pad Thai to go with imperial rolls. The pad Thai was a little on the expensive side at 13.95 but it was worth it. Cooked perfectly the noodles were not sticky.  Generous with chicken. I would liked to have seen chop-suey or another vegetable besides a spring of parsley on the top. Overall I am happy with what I ate and I'll be coming back again. Definitely better than Golden Bowl across the street who in my opinion don't know how to cook any Asian dish."}
{"text":"Don't like to sit alone in a restaurant so I like places that offer takeout. This place uses a service to take online orders, ideal when going back to the hotel.  Tonight was really good: the crab soup actually had crab, the kamikaze maki had solid tuna, not tartare, and the pad that had plenty of shredded chicken and six nice size shrimp. Everything beat my expectations, the noodles in the pad thai were compressed into a bloc, which I had to tear apart.  Notwithstanding the noodles, everything tasted amazing.  But, if you go make it a Thursday evening. Twice I have been really happy with my order, but once it was pretty bad, with my food lukewarn, fried apples rubbery, no tea that was supposed to be with the table d'hote. Not to sound sexist, but both Thursdays the staff in the dining room was female; the Tuesday night, I think it was, there were two guys and they didn't even bother with utensils. And the ladies gave me a 10% discount!   No idea about the kitchen staff, but again Thursday night rocks.  Definitely going back for more.  PS: Bring your own wine. Most restaurants in the area allow that, but I don't know of they licensed to sell alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Great discovery near my hotel. Truly excellent spring rolls, and the lemongrass beef curry was delicious. Very subtle flavors and fresh ingredients. It also serves sushi, although I didn't sample that. Maybe on my next trip to Montreal! Wonderful example of a neighborhood restaurant. Very clean. Highly recommended."}
