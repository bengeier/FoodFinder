{"text":"There are several Chinese restaurants but this by far is the best in the area.  New management - they bought the business about a year or so ago. What a difference compared to the previous owners.   A must try!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese north of Beddington Trail between Deerfoot and 14th.  Chef Leung advertises that he won 1st place at the Hong Kong Chinese Cooking Contest back in 1983 and he still has it.  Order the Palace Style Prawns and the Cantonese Chow Mein, you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Good quality Chinese food and excellent value!  I got the dinner for 2 special and it is more like dinner for 3-4...  Fast polite service :)"}
{"text":"Yummy hibachi. Sometimes they don't have a chef on duty for it but when they do. Yay!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Have tried  Numerous Chinese restaurants in the Cleveland area. And I always come back to this one. The flavor of the food Is outstanding. They do a phenomenal take out service on weekends. Numerous orders. Service is great ,prices are good too !! You've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Defiantely the best Habachi I have ever had! When we went there last Wednesday we had the whole restaurant to ourselves and it was buy 1 habachi dinner get one half off. Not so much of a party atmosphere like normal Habachi restaurants but still a lot of fun! They dont shoot saki in your mouth so if your looking to get a little tipsy off some free saki this is not the place. Great service though! Highly reccomend it!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in and had take-out at the Dragon for years.  We have also tried other Chinese restaurants in the area but we always come back to the Dragon.  We would highly recommend the Dragon - It has the best Chinese food we have ever had."}
{"text":"Typical Americanized Chinese food, but a high quality.  Not pretentious like PF Changs, but maybe not as well executed either.  Another \"go-to\" take out joint for my wife and I. The lo-mein has mushrooms which is a party foul for me, but other than that, everything is very good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out in the area.  Nice staff and very fresh not so greasy food. Tasty!"}
{"text":"This is definitely our favorite local Chinese takeout! We're always happy to drive by the three places that are closer to us to go to Dragon Garden."}
{"text":"GROSS. NO. NEVER AGAIN.  Just take one discerning look at your surroundings, and you'll never return. Discovering 100-year-old bits of dried food, bugs, dust, possibly bodily fluids, and duck sauce on every surface from the floor to the ceiling is enough to induce a dry (or wet!) heave. bslkfjasdfbb.  Don't expect to be able to recognize your food, either. Whatever you order, it'll be a tepid medium brown mess in a viscous sauce the consistency of hair gel. And your meat? Whatever it is, it'll be like biting into your maltipoo's chew toy. Just. Rubber.  I have to believe that the high ratings are coming from the 60+ crowd, who is fervently loyal to their known food establishments (and who also believe that sweet & sour chicken is a remotely authentic ethnic dish).   My dear sexagenarian friends, you don't have to treat yourself this way! You deserve better than neon-colored, salty sauces and \"egg rolls\" (?!) fried to oblivion. There IS a world of delicious, fresh, and non-coma-inducing Chinese food out there! Though, of course, it's probably and sadly not in Northfield, or Summit County for that measure. Sigh. The search continues."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times but only in cases where my favorite place in the area is closed. Dragon Garden tends to have longer hours and works on more holidays that others in the area. The food is OK, but never great. I've never been thrilled with the quality of the meat but it is not terrible. I've only ever ordered out so I have not experienced the hibachi."}
{"text":"AMAZING food and hibachi! Sushi is fresh also! I reccomend war-su-gai OR hibachi filet and chicken!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in the area. Great lunch deals, even on Saturday. Always fast hot  and ready when they say it is."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Northfield Ohio you must check this place out. Great Chinese food, and the Hibachi I will put it right up against Fuji and its just as good and the price is way cheaper!  They do Sushi, Hibachi, and a killer variety of Chinese dishes.  Atmosphere is fantastic.  Feel Free to check out their menu here :  http://www.allmenus.com/oh/northfield-center/258366-dragon-garden/menu/"}
{"text":"I've been going there for years! Best Chinese food in the area! My favorite is cashew chicken and basil tofu! You must try it!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant three years ago and it was so bad, I could not eat my meal.  I don't think there's any other time I can recall a meal so off for lack of a better word that I would not eat it.  So three years later I'm reading the decent reviews and think maybe it was just a bad night, they are so close, let's try take out.  Mistake.  We both took bites of common Chinese food take out dishes and stopped.  The food is not just bad, it tastes weird.  Then my husband told me the place smelled bad when he went to get it and was not clean.  We threw the food away."}
{"text":"Ordered Hunan chicken to go.  It was prepared with very little flavor.  Very poor attempt at this dish."}
{"text":"Love Dragon Garden. Cannot beat their prices for hibachi and for sushi - and never the ridiculous waits you will encounter at other big chain hibachi places. Service is always fantastic."}
{"text":"There are nice little surprises you get when you're out and about, and one one such adventure of  \"getting lost\" as my wife likes to put our little accidental bits of tourism , we stumbled into a certain garden...  We are pleased:)  The Dragon Garden is a cozy, warm little place with a fair to middlin' bar (not really a sit down, but you can drinks to order,) and a really  tasty menu with forays into Thai, Szechuan, Cantonese and even a smattering of Vietnamese.   The combo platters are priced right, the food is well done and tasty and you get a really good amount for...a really GOOD amount! Prices are great and the service was really fast. With pick up and dine-in, I heartily suggest stopping in for a bite or two for lunch or dinner. It won't break your bank and it'll make your taste buds happy you stopped by:)"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years. The staff and owners are always very friendly and the food is great. The hibachi is some of the best around and my kids love the show. Overall it is a local treasure and we are lucky to have it."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since 1999. We moved to Phoenix in 2003 and can't wait to eat here when we come back to visit. We're very picky about our Chinese food and love this place. The service is so great that even though a year can pass and the waitress remembers what I order to drink! Always love the food every time!"}
{"text":"Decent but not outstanding Americanized Chinese food. The curry chicken with steamed vegetables was good, but everything else was just okay. Not much more to add."}
{"text":"Food is good price is right.  Needs to be a little cleaner and a fresh coat of paint.  In other words, TLC"}
{"text":"We visit Patrick and Janice at LEAST once a week. The food is consistently great and carefully prepared. It's always good. But what is as important to us is how warm, kind and genuine Patrick and Janice are, as is their small staff. They know their regulars and always greet us with a big welcome when we arrive. Wonderful family. Wonderful food."}
{"text":"The food quality is great.  Friendly service.  Definitely one of my fav spots to visit on a budget.  And did I say real chicken!!!! Awesome spot"}
{"text":"To start off I must say Smiles is much better. Not that dragon garden was bad but smiles is better. When I walked in for my pick up order there was no one there to greet me so if I was there to dine in I would have been waiting a good ten minutes. That being said I had called my order in about 20 minutes prior and the lady on the phone said 15 minutes and it would be ready. So if you can do math that's a good 30 minutes when she claimed it to be 15. Any way back to the food. I ordered szechuan chicken like I always do from smiles and the flavor was just off, and there was some funky lingering after taste to the rice as if it had been made with dirty dish water or something. Any way I don't think I will be going back. Smiles I wish you weren't closed yesterday :("}
{"text":"I cannot speak to the hibachi or sushi but the Chinese food at this establishment was some of the worst I have ever had. It tasted like all of the sauces came out of a can but even worse. I don't understand all the high ratings for this place if you've ever enjoyed good Chinese."}
{"text":"Very good chinese food.  Excellent sized portions.  My wife and I both ordered the War-Su Gai and it was excellent.  (For some reason chinese restaurants in Cuyahoga Falls do not offer it) .   My daughter had the Cicken Lo-Mein and said it was the best she has ever eaten.   Generous fried rice portions as well.   The service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Chinese food around!!! The staff is so friendly too (which is important in any business) also they sell lucky bamboo plants-which are healthier  & just more beautiful than Home Depot or any other place I've seen them. Besides having the best Hibachi & Chinese dishes the lucky bamboo plants all around (for sale) are just gorgeous & cheaper priced than I've seen. They also make great gifts!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Overall: I got take-out.  Food was good, and prices were very reasonable.  Food: 3 stars.  Hunan beef was good with lots of veggies.  Pork fried rice was average.  Wonton soup was good.  Teriyaki beef sticks were good but a little slimy so they needed to be cooked more.  Price: 5 stars.  Lunch combination meals are mostly $5.75 and dinner are $8-$9.  Wonton soup is $2.25 small and $4.00 large.  Teriyaki beef sticks $5.75.  Shrimp chips $1.  Appearance: 3 stars.  It's fairly large inside.  Decor is a tired Chinese restaurant cliche, and needs a refresh.  Service: 3 stars.  Gave me the food and I paid."}
{"text":"Returned for the Japanese prepared at the table side of the restaurant. Not excellent, but a very good performance by the chef and decent food."}
{"text":"This family owned establishment has been a staple in the Nordonia Hills area for years.   The addition of sushi and hibachi have increased the greatness of the place.   Super reasonably priced, consistent good food and service make this a winner."}
{"text":"Ordered hibachi last night and both my husband and I came down with food poisoning. Awful."}
{"text":"People, pick one cuisine and stick to it! The massive multi-national, cluttered menu made it even more disappointing to have chosen such a poorly executed dish. Without exaggeration, the simple dish that was brought out seemed to be lathered in saliva. The chicken was pink. Downright nasty menu item! Can't speak for all five-hundred dishes, but can't imagine a more complicated entree being much better."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a new Chinese spot to go to since our old restaurant changed owners (and the quality right with it). Dragon Garden was nearby and the Yelp reviews were positive. Menu selection was expansive and very tasty. Our family of finicky eaters were quite pleased and well fed.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Ordered this tonight and unfortunately it was not the best, I guess one of the risks of trying a new place. Was fast which was nice. Little to no meat in the dishes."}
{"text":"Surprisingly awesome Hibachi and Sushi at this restaurant!!  If you are looking for Japanese food, this place is it!  The portions are huge and the food is fresh.  The combination platters are well priced with high quality ingredients.  I have to say that the sauces that come with the hibachi meals are the best in the area.  The chefs are a lot of fun as well!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat old school but I mean that as a compliment. Our waitress was friendly & perfectly attentive, the atmosphere was quiet and clean but the food .... I can't really say that it was bad because (in this situation) it comes down to personal preference rather than a bad meal.    I have been sick on & off for a week so this was thankfully the first meal I was able to eat without getting woozy afterwards. However, there were a lot of pieces (particularly the smaller ones) of orange chicken that were really tough! Like you're chewing on  leather  yet the larger pieces were delicious! I really enjoyed their take on orange sauce, not too sweet nor bland. But overall I didn't like my chicken, it tasted burnt to me & was more like crispy chicken skin rather than tender , juicy bites. My husband however, loved it!   So again, maybe it was just me. I would gladly be willing to give this place another chance. I just wish I could've taken my magic pot of tea with me... it was so good and relaxing that I just wanted to fall asleep in the booth and I felt so much better afterwards."}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 out of 5 stars?  There must be a lot of people living in the Northfield area with messed up taste buds.  My wife and I ordered about two months ago and weren't really impressed.  It was quite so so.  We ordered from them a week ago for pick up and it was horrible.  Wife ordered the chicken and broccoli.   Her meal actually looked good but the taste was very bland.  I ordered the pineapple chicken. My meal was simply horrible.  My ENTIRE carry out container was full of sauce and there might have been six small pcs of chicken in there.  Thankfully I got to scrounge my wife's leftovers.  We will not be going back to this place.  Also, pay with credit card so they pay their taxes."}
{"text":"I have gone here for 15 years or more, have not once had a bad meal! They are so kind and caring with their service! Love supporting local places like this!!! Keep it up dragon garden!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place for the first time today, and it really disappointed. The food was of poor quality and inedible; we had a few bites and had to throw the rest away. Spent $50 for the food to go to the garbage. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
