{"text":"Loved it! Ordered the Korean fried chicken, beef tacos and PBJ chicken fingers. All were awesome:)"}
{"text":"This is our usual spot to go when we're too lazy to seek out other places beyond our Bay Street bubble. The decor tries a bit hard, but there are enough TV screens to look at when the conversation turns awkwardly silent.  The beer selection is great. Food is not bad. My only issue is that \"pint\" has now been redefined as a 10oz glass. There's definitely an issue with their beer sizing - 3oz, 10oz and then suddenly a 30oz growler?"}
{"text":"$5 draught and $5 starters/main plates- not too bad. The food tasted great! Great vibe. Only negative -the service was slow."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome beers. Smiling, friendly and knowledgable staff. Always refreshing rotating taps. Personal nachos are  kick ass too!"}
{"text":"Was my first time here and had the poutine. It was not the best one I have had but it was still good. The music here is lively. There are multiple tv's showing all kinds of sports. I would recommend coming here with friends"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time as part of a large group event.  I was very impressed with the food quality and quantity.  The wings were large and very tasty, as were the excellent chicken and shrimp tacos.  Further, the wait staff were attentive, courteous and happy!    Looking forward to future visits :)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem and I'm so glad that it's near my workplace. It's good bar food with a small price tag! I always order the chicken fingers but the portion is big under $10. Very saucy and comes with fries... similar to Jack Astor's but at a much lower price point! It's a fun and laid back place to go with coworkers or if you're in the area looking for a quick bite. I highly recommend this bar and they also have quite a variety of beers so you can't go wrong! The only downside is the service can be iffy depending on how busy it gets."}
{"text":"Aesthetically I love this place. Cool mix of brick, wood, and metal. But man is it not comfortable. The high top tables and chairs just can't be sat in for long. And after tasting the food I can say that I didn't want to stay long at all. We came to watch the World Cup and the setup is great for that. Lots of TVs and great audio. We decided to try the Sweet Potato Thing which is a tower of fries and onions that is covered with WAY too much fried crunchy dry topping. You lose the flavour of the potato and onion under the coating. The slider was fine but the focaccia was cold."}
{"text":"Tonight, I was \"that person\". I went in with no idea what I wanted to eat or drink. The bartender Ryan, as well as the other gentlemen behind the wood, were so accommodating! They helped me find the perfect beer to suit my likes, as well as customizing my burger for the best flavor. I liked the decor and atmosphere, very fun and casual. Bathrooms were exceptionally clean, which is always a plus! If I was local, I could definitely see it as a favorite watering hole."}
{"text":"I like the sampler option, the wings were tossed in the sauce in front of me which is cool. A bit pricey but probably about normal for this type of place and location.    Good service and decent food. The server wasn't most knowledgeable but had good notes and was patient with us.  Don't forget to get your cotton candy on the way out!  Gets a bit stale though haha"}
{"text":"Sircorp, you're a class act!  When you yanked the thick cut pork chop from the Canyon Creek menu, for whatever reason, I was ready to boycott and spend my dining dollars elsewhere.  Then you came up with Duke's Refresher concept .... and my world changes again!  Was dying for hot trending  concepts like BJ Brewhouse , Houlihans or Yardhouse - thriving down in the states, but thought that in Canada - even  if it is Toronto, just couldn't sustain such a joint.  Boy, was I wrong!   Or should I say - were we wrong!!  The staggered 'Happy Hour - $5 Tap and Apps' is brilliant.  The small plates are so well executed most of the time -- I see bona-fide Koreans coming for the Korean Yangeom chicken (with $5 Craft Beer pints - of course).  The warm chips with the Guacomole just hit the spot with a few brew.  Shrimps were tiny - but then Torontonians are used to it ...and for $5 - can be accepted.  The most incredible bold move I've seen is when you doubled the size your draft and not raise the price -  how's that for pivoting on market sentiments!   Kudos.  With Red next to Scaddabush connected to Duke - you're got the dynamic scheduling and kitchen assist to make magic happen and ready for anything that competition may throw at you.   Congratulation, and please keep up the great work!   Hey, expand that $5 App selection, wouldya!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE NACHOS!!   Okay, this would be a decent bar if not for a couple of reasons. The beer selection on the menu is good, but it's outdated as a few of the different beers we tried to order were no longer being served. Beer prices are meh, kind of expensive but that's to be expected for the location.  I cannot stress this enough though, do NOT order the nachos. We did so and it was pathetic. There were 4 of us so we got the \"long\" chicken nachos - over $15 and advertised as 3 feet of nachos! Sounded great, but when it came out it was about 15 chips in total! I'm not exaggerating! Almost no nachos and they were mostly covered in iceberg.  Atmosphere was good though but the service was poor so it kind of balanced out in that regard."}
{"text":"Our Full Belly, Tight Budget group had a fabulous dinner event at Duke's Refresher + Bar at Yonge and Gerrard.  Our organizer for the group is Itanni Betancourt and she chose well to hold our party here.  The atmosphere was fun and lively - we had the whole 2nd level.  The waitresses were friendly.  The food was yummy and abundant - there was a lot to take home.  What makes Duke stand out is how hot and fresh the food was - especially for a party our size.  One of my faves was the huge and delicious chicken tenders served with a well balanced plum sauce.  The chicken tenders were nice and hot through and through - quickly fresh out of the kitchen.  The mini donuts were also served nice and hot.  I loved the toasted sandwich - goat cheese, balsamic reduction, arugula and tomato.  I would love to return for this sandwich and the tenders!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest experience... Had expected better but was disappointed by slow service and very small portions. We weren't in a rush at all. Food quality was average. Many other choices in the area thankfully."}
{"text":"I was there with a few friends Thursday night and I have never been so appalled by the service. I had ordered a dirty martini which tasted like water. I asked server to have it replaced, her reaction and need to have another server make me feel incompetent and feel uncomfortable for being dissatisfied was incredibly rude. We quickly paid and changed watering holes. Perk up, you work in customer service. A smile increases your tip and customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Disappointingly slow service, mediocre food, and sadly every beer I wanted on tap was out. Shame. I wanted to like this place.   Ordered the Classic Cobb salad and was baffled when it came out... What was sitting in front of me was an indolently cut, single open-faced romaine lettuce heart. It looked like chef threw a couple cubes of avocado and grape tomatoes, sprinkled some bacon flakes and called it a day. I couldn't even make out what the dressing was, or if it even existent on my \"salad.\" I've had (much) better.   My dinner companion's appetizer \"The Slippery Shrimp\" was nothing notable either.   The \"Sweet Potato Thing\" however, was great. A generous and delicious muddle of sweet potato fries and fried onions, drizzled with some kind of aioli on top. Sweet potatoes always saves the day.   All in all, my experience wasn't the best- next time I'll just go to Loose Moose."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!! Great vibe and friendly, tentative staff. Tons of beer on tap. Get the chicken parm sandwich! It was so unbelievably good!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular for a year and a half and am a member of the \"stein club.\"  I work and live in the area and just love(d) the place.  Great food, nice staff (though the recent crop seem a bit less friendly and engaged), and an awesome selection of beers.  Great decor.  But...  There seems of have been a recent change to both the menu and ambiance.  Some of my favourite items on the menu are either gone or changed.  Whatever, I'll get over it.  But the other change, which will keep me away indefinitely, is that they have decided to crank up the music to create more of a \"party\" atmosphere.  The net result of this is that, in many areas of the bar, it is pretty much impossible to carry on a conversation.    I complained to one of the staff and they said that the new, louder music is the policy of the owners, and that the staff are not allowed to turn it down.  Given that I go there after work, usually with colleagues, and I can no longer carry on a conversation when I go there,  I won't be back.  Too bad.  Used to be the best bar in the area by a long shot."}
{"text":"Duke's is located at Yonge and Gerrard which is in the heart of the downtown core, but the service and atmosphere is quite personal and inviting. My first visit was with one of my best friends for an early lunch and with 40 beers on tap we couldn't resist!  Our server was very helpful and pleasant but not overbearing even though the place was quite empty. The fish tacos were great and the dessert waffle we split and was amazing!  I will definitely be going back and our server mentioned that on Friday night is a chill bar atmosphere filled with university/college students, so I will be back to check that out when I'm back in the city!"}
{"text":"Duke's is now my go-to bar in Toronto.  THE BEER selection is great, prices ain't too bad as well. They have a $5 deal on beers and apps right now which is awesome, not sure if it'll last. The deal has got me through the door a little more often.  THE FOOD is better than I expected. The wings are really good, if they had a wing night I would be there every week! I've had a few of there other apps, all good, I especially liked the spicy tuna poke.  THE ATMOSPHERE is great, exactly what I look for in a bar. They have sports on the TV and classic rock coming through the speakers. Even though this might make me sound old (early 30s) I like that the music isn't too loud so I'm able to have a conversation without screaming.  THE STAFF was really great. I'm not too picky with the service I get, but it's nice when it goes above and beyond. The manager also stopped by our table to see how things were, he was really friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place; great atmosphere, good customer service, food is great too. I recommend the breakfast poutine. Love the music. It can get pretty busy when the after work crowd moves in so I like going on the weekends to hang out and start off the night."}
{"text":"I dont mean to be harsh but Dukes Refresher is what it is:  A corporate resto a la Jack Astors/Caseys/Shoeless Joes, etc.  Ended up popping in last week, have a buddy who works here. Sadly, he wasnt in. Served by a barman who was insane over  the top friendly - there is a such thing as too attentive - and  described every beer as \"interesting\". Place is 95% industrial suds, though they are seemingly trying promote themselves as a craft beer bar.  Anyhow, we had a couple pints of Guinness, kudos to the over-friendly barman, he could pour a decent pint.  Didn't eat so can't comment on the food.  I'm sure Dukes will do lots of business with the corporate and 40 something crowd, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Craft beers! Great selection that changes often which is hard to find in the Discovery District. Try them all with sampler size glasses.  Caesars are decent but small. Try them with gin or tequila. 4 stars for the drinks.  3 stars for the food. Haven't tried too much of the menu but the fries have only a slight crispy exterior and moderately fluffy interior. Only tried the burgers a couple of times and the patty is under-seasoned. The fried chicken is interesting. A bit to much coating but awesome portion. From what i recalled there was a honey lime sauce that was decent but a bit too much cloves flavour. I enjoyed the fish and chips. Flakey and moist.    Every table has a bottle of hot sauce that I was told is made in house. It's actually quite palatable. I like heat and this is definitely not too spicy (aimed towards the general public). It's more part hot sauce, part barbecue sauce. It tastes like a pepper mash preparation that is only minimally fermented. It's a nice change of pace from the usual condiments.  Ambience: music is too loud. They have TVs and sometimes I go post-call to watch a game and enjoy a pint but the music makes it less comfortable. Reds next door is a better place to watch a game.  Overall decent place that's getting better. I'll continue to patron this establishment."}
{"text":"Casual pub setting with upstairs and patio setting. Generous food portion and price is reasonable. Burgers are at $11 with a thick beef patty on a buttery bun... If you order a salad or fries you have to pay $2.75(?) extra so we just got a plate of poutines instead. Tuna and avo sandwich is very good, has Asian flavour (sesame seed oil) and was very tasty. Great craft beer selection although the server insisted central city brewery is local to Ontario.... A little knowledge mishap there but gotta say she was very friendly otherwise! They had beer special today and a good selection was priced at $5 a pint.. That is cheap compared to Vancouver! Overall I was very happy with the food and service here."}
{"text":"Great location. I inhaled the French Onion Poutine and look forward to the Sweet Potato Thing on my next visit."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to grab a burger in Toronto. First went to it in Muskoka and fell in love, so happy it's in Toronto now."}
{"text":"Dropped in while staying across the street at the Delta Chelsea. Pleasantly surprised -- great beer list, nice wait staff, good appetizers, and sports plus movies on tv, a great place for me myself and i. Maybe not a great date spot, but an excellent place to relax while traveling through Toronto."}
{"text":"Wish I could say this place is great for  post work drinks. But the bar staff is more interested in making cotton candy than waiting on guests. Avoid if you prefer service over location."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! We stumbled upon by chance. We were a party of 4 and we were able to sit in the upstairs area. FOOD We all ordered burgers. each of them had a distinct flavor (according to my friends). I took the Woody. The bacon focaccia was crispy and fatty, so yummy! When you bite it, the sauce (not really spicy) explodes in your mouth and it combines with the meat in the perfect combination. Fries were well cooked, crunchy outside and soft inside. Portions looked small but they are enough to fill you up. They have a special promotion: if you get a stamp and come back the morning after for breakfast you get a discount (you get a larger discount if the stamp is on your face) BEERS They have more than 40 taps beers!! Yay!! ost are the \"usual\" but others are unique and local. You can register to be a member of their \"beer club\". you get your own mug and discounted refills. I REALLY REALLY wanted to join but they were already sold out for this year :( :( :(  AMBIANCE AND SERVICE Our server was nice and she took care of our order without any delay despite all the people in the restaurant. I love the background music (old classic rock)  and the TV screens that show sport and old vintage movies. It is an amazing addition to the neighbourhood, can't wait to go back again!!  PS if you ask, you can get free cotton candy!!!! mind blowing!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my new Local. Great beer selection, not good for wine. Our server was awesome and like a breath of fresh air. He told us to stay away from the wines and go with beers as they are entry level, nothing special wines. So honest!   We had cans of beer. All craft and tried multiple. The IPAs are fab! 6.8 and 7%. Would put hair on your chest! I'm not an ale fan but I'm told they were great!   For food we had sandwiches and burgers. The portobello burger was one of the nicest burgers I've ever tasted. And I hate mushrooms. It was fantastic. Cheesy, tender  and savoury. The fries are good too. I had the club which c came with balsamic. Very tasty, light  and the balsamic gave it a nice twist. The sweet potato fries came with Chipotle mayo and it was very tasty. The fries were a little heavily salted. The woody burger was a tasty, man sized burger with a good smoky bbq flavour.   Throw in classic 80s and 90s tunes and some dancing on the bar and you've got a great night. Oh and we got coupons for free cider for next time. Awesome. Now where did I leave the advice??...."}
{"text":"I'll be back!  Stopped in here after a brief trip to see a friend living in the area. This spot amazed me the first time in came and has done it  yet again!!  It's directly across from the Chelsea Hotel I'm then downtown area which makes most of its patrons international travelers mixed with university students (which makes for great times and conversations)  The bar menu itself is normal but all things are huge and made differently then norm bar grub. .. try the nacho log which is , you guessed it nachos but on a  long board and each chip separated and ingredients add one after another until the board is full.   The bar list is extensive and and tops elf liquors extensive as well. The beer list is through the roof with I'd day maybe 30 plus beers on tap and bottles.  5.00 pints all day!!!  The staff here are amazing and we'll versed in what beers are best for you including where it's made and a small history behind it. Later in the evenings a local dj comes in and spins house music but not to loud (starts about 10pm)  Pros- Staff, menu, drink selection  Cons -  still haven't found any."}
{"text":"Duke's has quickly become one of my favourite downtown bars. It has a great vibe, with great music, funky decor, and an awesome second floor balcony that overlooks the entire bar (my favourite spot!). The best thing about this bar, however, is the craft beer! The selection is quite large and I love that they have samplers for you to try before committing to a pint of the good stuff. I've always had great service too - friendly, quick and knowledgable about the beers they carry.   The only reason I can't give this bar 5 stars, is that the food is ... well... mediocre. I've had the classic cobb salad (romaine lettuce comes uncut which is something I don't like in a salad) and chicken club (a little on the bland side), and was rather underwhelmed.   Despite the food, I love this bar and continue to drop in for a drink from time to time. Oh, and the free cotton candy when you leave is a nice touch :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Duke's for over a year now and just love the casual atmosphere with the uniqueness of the mismatched tables and chairs.  The decor is definitely something special - check out the washroom!  The place sometimes feels like a log cabin/cottage that was mixed with sports bar and no nonsense lounge.  Definitely a neighbourhood gem that delivers on great food with a no fuss attitude and plenty of beers .  No  pretentiousness here!  The food is pretty amazing here and I have tried most of the menu items.  Good size portions (sometimes too much) and reasonable prices.  I definitely recommend the Duke's Big Breakfast, Breakfast Poutine, Portobello and Swiss Burger, The Woody, Dirty Bird and the wings.  The staff always friendly and for the most part efficient, but sometimes forgetful and at times can be slow.   Nonetheless, plenty of beers to go around as they have a large selection including craft beers.  They're called Refresher for a reason.  This afternoon, I dropped by Duke's to purchase a Stein Club tag.  The cost is $20 and the benefits for members are listed below:  * Free brunch for you and a friend once a month * Be entered into a weekly draw to win awesome prizes * Drink out of your own personal Stein at Duke's * Exclusive invites to Stein Club events * 15% discount on food when you show your Stein tag  I'm definitely looking forward to my refresher in a stein.  Go get yours before Duke's sells out as quantities are limited.  What are you waiting for? Go get some beer!"}
{"text":"Great spot when you're in the mood for good food and decently priced beers. My meal came to just $30 including tax and tip, and I had the fish & chips and two pints (they have about five different beers that are always priced at just $5/pint). Our server was great - attentive, but not too intrusive. We came on a Monday night and they had $5 apps, which seemed like a great deal although we each opted for a full meal."}
{"text":"Love this place i would of deff gave this place a 5star but i didn't. The only reason why i didn't give it a 5 star is because when i got there i thought i was going to be seated so i waited for a host to come by, but i didn't get one til like 5 min of just standing there until a lady finally came out and said sit any where. So we take our sits and im thinking ok there must be a menu on the table. Nope the only thing was menu for drinks. So then im like ok maybe she went to get the menus. Waiting... i see the lady again and she taking other peoples order and im just watching her she left again and came back to the same people. At that moment i was about to get up and just leave i think i waited almost 10min. Then finally another waiter came thank god she was very nice and very helpful. After we got our menus and order the food came in like 5-10min pretty fast so it made up for the wait and the food oh my god. It's so GOOD. Must go."}
{"text":"Lovely little gem!   First of all they have 40 beers on tap! That should be enough to go! And they have amazing food too!   I tried the pear cider which was crisp and flavorful. A nicer drink than traditional apple cider.  The bacon burger is phenomenal! Super juicy and flavorful with a nice soft bun.   I also tried a flat bread which was so yummy! It was like a taco on flat bread. Lots of great flavour!    The decor is a mix of upscale lounge and perfectly quaint. There is a wall leading upstairs made of old doors and a row of lovely pastel chairs outside.   The staff are super friendly and attentive. The GM came to talk with us and ensured a fantastic experience.   Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food... friendly staff... it was our family's favorite place during our visit to Canada"}
{"text":"Best pub food that I've had in Toronto! Fairly priced, as in not overpriced like most places. If you go to Duke's, order the sliders!! Absolute heaven with extra bacon on top. No joke! The top of the slider buns have bacon baked into them. Superior craft beer menu and accommodating staff. They are happy to make made-to-oder martinis and other beverages not on menu!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to grab a pint around College Park, check out Duke's Refresher! The entrance is on Gerrard street and it is located in the Aura building.  I like that they have a great beer selection with rotating craft brews on tap. Sample sizes (3oz) available if you want to try a few beers. Also, there are happy hour specials, $5 share plates from 5pm to 7pm.  As for the food, they have a good selection of appetizers and mains. I ordered a salad with seared tuna and it was surprisingly very pretty and tasted great!  It was topped with taro crisps and a light vinaigrette.  My friend ordered fish and chips that were a bit overcooked.  We told the server and the cook came out to ask if my friend wanted another serving. Great service!  This is definitely one  of my favorite casual spots for after work drinks!"}
{"text":"Average food. Slow service. The bar is loud, which I understand some people prefer. Ordered the poutine, took close to half and hour to come, and was barely warm."}
{"text":"Food was great. We started with chicken balls, then had BBQ burger & Big Mac burger. Our service was good at first, but it took a long time to get our second beer. By the time we wanted a third drink we felt totally abandoned and it took us forever to pay (we actually had to get up and ask another server to close our bill)."}
{"text":"I love this place! Come here all the time as it's close to my work, but would still come even if it wasn't. Great food, amazing beer selection. Staff are super friendly and service usually quite good. Only complaints if I had to really find some are it can be loud, and they keep changing the menu and prices of items. But other than that, this is my go-to Bay corridor bar."}
{"text":"What a great place for food and drinks.  From the moment we walked in we knew we would like it. Loved the atmosphere and the service was superb.    First night in Toronto for drinks and an appetizer (fabulous Poutine!!) and then back the next day for lunch and drinks after an exhausting trip to the zoo.  Just what I needed to relax and cool off.   Will and Brit took great care of me while I was having Lunch (PBJ fingers yummy!!!).    Plan on going at least once more before we head out.  Great food, drinks and awesome service. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for a get-together. We ordered Nachos, the quality and portion of the food declined compared to first time."}
{"text":"Make reservations for a group and our table was placed upstairs. We ordered three appetizers everyone ordered one to three alcoholic drinks and an entree except for myself I arrived late. The waitress brown medium-length hair was not the friendliest was trying to persuade me to get an entree, she mentioned that although we had ordered 3 plates of finger foods to share that's really not a lot of food. I told her I was fine I was mainly there to socialize. When we all finished our food she tried to convince our table to purchase mini Donuts like a salesman we declined and said we full and then she mentioned that they're only $6 for 12 we can all split it, they're only bite size. Still, no thanks pushy. I also don't appreciate how she was taking away food without asking if we have finished it. No plans to come back here"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice so far, each time ordering a different burger and drinks. The beef patties for the burgers are extra dry, but they try to balance it out with other ingredients such as extra sauce or cheese etc. The fries that come with burgers are ok. Even though it is not super expensive, the quality of food still does not match the price in my opinion. This place is very loud and attracts the younger population (25-35 y/o). The bar looks good and they show live sports and old movies on their TVs. Overall, considering the food quality, price, ambiance and the whole experience, I would rate it as 3 stars."}
{"text":"first of all when i came here last night i had no expectations as far as menu, experience etc. i was just looking for some place to relax and unwind since i was staying at some hotel nearby.  its,a nice kitschy artsy comfy vibe. seems to have alot of downtown business from families, businesspeople and other assorted people.  i got this double hamburger with a side of guac. while i was waiting i noticed that playing on the big screen was some 80s horror movie and a david hasslehoff music video playing on some of the other screens. i noticed the barttenders singing along and other bar patrons were taking notice of this and were amused as well. i have no idea what song it was. then the \"days go by \"techno song went on.   i then started to look for a place like juke box like maybe you could pay and your musoc vid ends up on tbe big screen. alas no such luck.   still i like the vibe and the hamburger and guac seemed kinda tasty.   loved the setting, cool and calm staff and the patrons who frequent. its,damn good food. when i come back to Toronto i am coming back here for sure"}
{"text":"Watched the game here tonight and I must say I was very disappointed with the food. I've been looking forward to coming here as it's a new bar in my neighbourhood. It's too bad the food wasn't enjoyable. We had the wings, sweet potato thing, and the spicy shrimp tacos. I think I'd rather go to wild wings across the street at this point."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings we've ever had. Beef nacho is great too. The service wasn't great though."}
{"text":"While on vacation we decided to check out Duke's around happy hour. This was a great choice. Our server did an amazing job making suggestions and letting us  know what the local favorites are. We really enjoyed the sweet potato thing! The sauce that accompanied this appetizer was very good !  The next time I am in Toronto I will make a stop here !!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was terrible! Very slow and impolite staff unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - very chill, and a good selection of craft beer. Overall, a Great place to  relax and unwind.   The seared tuna sandwich was impressive considering this is Toronto. As a Vancouverite I've been spoilt in terms of the quality of sushi I've eaten. By comparison - the tuna itself was not bad - while it wasn't melt-in-your-mouth good, there was no hint of fishiness - probably helped by the pepper rub (and maybe a hint of lime?). In the sandwich with bacon and avocado (both of which were fresh and tasty) it was fine, making for a great sandwich.   Beware the Ceasar salad if you're not a huge fan of garlic."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos here (I chose the halibut) while the boyfriend got the fish and chips. What I instantly noticed was that both of our fish orders were reaaallly dark brown. At first I thought they overfried..then I tasted that it was beer battered so I thought maybe the beer caused the colour..then I saw other people's orders which had a lighter colour than our fish. Overall, I was confused. But regardless of the degree of frying I enjoyed both of our dishes, pretty yummy overall. I particularly liked their tartar sauce that came with the fish and chips. Not overwhelming dilly + added zestiness presumably from lemon that made it perfect in my mind. Overall based on food alone It would have been a 3-3.5.  What made me tip them higher on the star scale was the level of service! Our waitress literally scurried over to our table w/ a door stop b/c she saw our table was tilting and wanted to balance it for us. Honestly, I hardly even noticed the tilting table, but the fact that she made it a point to fix it for us was just ubeeer awesome!  All in all, this is a nice bar to hang out in the Ryerson area, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"3.5  stars - Above average craft beer selection, decent food and plenty of sports on the big screens.   Duke's \"claim to fame\" is 40 taps of beer. Before you get to excited, approximately half are from big brewers. That said - you still get an above average craft beer selection which shouldn't be overlooked. They also have 5 seasonal rotating craft taps that constantly change. Duke's generally participates in the cities various beer events. Loved the Beau's tap takeover event.  I find it odd that you can't get a \"pint\" of beer. Options include a 13 ounce glass or a 30 oz growler. They also serve sample size / flights if you want to try different beers.  Duke's never appears to be crowded which I like. They have a long bar with large screens to catch the nights game. I generally enjoy the atmosphere.   I find the service to be mixed. Some staff are amazing and passionate about their job and the beer industry while others just don't want to be there. I have a 50% success rate of getting good server vs. bad one.  Food is not bad - typical pub food. I had the chicken sandwich a few times, fairly good but a little on the small side. They do have excellent sweet potato fries. Prices are rather good for the neighbourhood - about $12 per entrees.  I find myself coming back primarily for the craft beer selection and all the TV's. There are certainly better craft beer pubs in the city but you don't get all the large screen TV's to enjoy the days sporting events.   BK"}
{"text":"Duke's gets a solid three stars.  It's a bit hard to find this new \"Muskoka-style\" bar in the Aura complex at Yonge and Gerrard (just keep walking east on Yonge past Reds and the Italian restaurant). I believe all three of the restaurants on the main floor of this complex are owned by the same company, and based on my previous visit to Red's, it shows. The restaurant itself is a little small, especially compared to Reds, and the layout is a bit narrow, but it's comfortable enough. The rustic, recovered distressed wood look actually comes off pretty well. It's a bit funny to think that this is in the bottom of a skyscraper that's still under construction, but it seems to work, and the concrete shells beneath condo buildings are where Toronto will be adding many of its future new restaurants in the downtown core, so it's nice to see that it can be pulled off.  As you would expect, there is quite a long beer list with many crafts beers. Certainly not the best in town, but it's quite a commendable list for Yonge and Gerrard. They have \"growlers,\" which are essentially just bottles that have just over two pints worth of beer in them. These are a bit cheaper than just ordering pints, but it's a bit of a strange gimmick.  They also have have a \"mug club,\" where you have your own dedicated mug when you visit, which is a bit of an odd choice in this location. As expected, these were all claimed and I'd imagine your odds of getting one would be very low unless you were a regular who lived in the building.  To eat, I had the sliders, which I enjoyed. The beef was juicy and they had a wise selection of small toppings. I'll come back at some point and try a larger meal when I'm hungrier.  One thing that I disliked was that they have unisex individual washrooms, which I think are great for restaurants, but I find this annoying at a bar. I hate it when it's unclear which rooms are vacant. Call me old fashioned, but a proper bar needs urinals!   The service was pretty good, even though we did get the wrong beer at one point (it was still good beer, so whatever)."}
{"text":"Duke's Refresher is a little hard to find, but worth the hunt. This 2-story venue, boasts TVs all over, high top, low top and picnic tables for your seating pleasure. Beer and food selection are pretty fabulous. I was pleasantly surprised by the food selection for a spot like this but, looks can be deceiving.    My group was there for dinner followed by trivia night, so it was packed! This was not Duke's first rodeo on trivia night, so they staffed accordingly. Drinks were kept full. I was enjoying a Fin Du Monde after a long day and was happy to see it on the menu. I ordered a Portobello Veggie Burger with fries. In my experience as a half-ass vegetarian, this could go either way. It was a winner. Fresh bun, lots of avocado, feta and served with fries. I'd get it again.   A friend of mine ordered the Bacon Caramel Mini Donuts for the table. They were fresh and sweet. Not much bacon crumble, but lots of caramel. You really only needed 1...but I may have eaten 3.    Service was pretty good. There was generally always a server around, if you needed one and they hadn't already popped by to check in. Duke's doesn't take reservations, but the staff were able to seat us upstairs when we arrived and then moved us downstairs for eats and just in time for trivia.    Trivia was perfect for the age group of my party. I've been to other places for trivia where it was really obscure or way before out time, but this one was fun and cheeky.   I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the impression I get is just kinda ok. Weird cowboy / punk theme. Pint selection seems decent and the place is always packed to the walls with the after work drinks crowd. Service is always exactly passable.  I've never had the food so I'll rerate when that happens."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday around 8pm, sat at the bar, asked if they had and drink specials, was told they did not, flipped thru the menu to find out that they had \"caesar sundays\" 3$  Ordered two and one was made unbearably spicy.  More frienda joined us and we tried to order more caesars and the server says they are out of caesars, i ask what does that mean and she responds with attitude that they are out of clamato juice, rather then send some one across the street to the 24 hour metro grocery store, they are simpy sold out!  Also asked the server two times for water and never got it.  As for the food; had the breakfast poutine and found it was very dry a cold.  There are many great establisments near by with much better managment and better food"}
{"text":"Finally back after years of avoiding this place based on previous negative experiences.  However, I have since taken a liking to beer, and this place has a solid selection.  First impression upon walking in was kind of negative, they had a table for four downstairs but just with stools so we thought we'd try our hand at the upstairs part, expressing this to the greeter, but she never said (but should have) - it's also all stools upstairs so might as well just snag this seat.  Because of that, we had to sit at two tables pushed together that didn't really go together.  Not a huge deal but when we explained why we were looking upstairs, she could have saved us the trouble.  I asked about one of their ciders and our server exclaimed, \"I f*&king hate that one,\" which is an honest but odd response, simply explaining the flavour profile would have sufficed.  Once I finally decided on a beer, the runner came back with 3/4 of our drinks, and mine wasn't right.  She essentially argued with me that I had ordered something they didn't have, trying very hard to get me to just take the incorrect beer off of her.  When our server came back, he explained it was that they'd run out of the beer he'd sold me on (and not that I'm an idiot).    So, despite the uncomfortable seats and non-perfect service, why the upgrade in stars?  Basically, the food was bomb.  The onion rings were some of the best I've had in ages, which is always a huge plus.  The chicken sandwich fell apart right away, but was still good deconstructed.  The food is expensive AF, but I didn't feel cheated.  Fun, vibrant atmosphere, although very hot on the upper level.  My other friend who was sitting at the bar downstairs the same night got her wallet stolen from her bag, so be careful!"}
{"text":"This is a great local watering hole for students in the area. There's a good crowd that comes here and it's a very casual and fun environment. For downtown, it has great deals and good portions for pub grub for your money's worth. There's a solid selection of beers on tap. It can be a bit busy and loud at times which makes a lively environment, and the music they play is classic radio top forty songs. Always a good time and good service!"}
{"text":"It's a nice sports bar. Went here to watch the Euro game and it was pretty live. The service was pretty good. We got the guac with chips and they were really good! Will have to go back to try the actual food"}
{"text":"Great Beer Selection, really good Food, could be a Little bit more for the Price. Nice Staff, quick, easy, fine."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for burgers and fish and chips and leave satisfied everytime. For downtown bar food, the portions and prices are reasonable.   My go-to meal here is the two-piece fish and chips at $15. I have to say that relative to a few months ago, the portion seems slightly smaller, but it is definitely still enough to fill you up. The fish would benefit from a little less time in the fryer because it walks a fine line bordering on burnt. However, I like my deep fried good super crispy and crunchy, so I enjoy it. If you want fish that's fried with less batter and a little more finesse, try the Duke of Somerset nearby.   The cole slaw is the bum note on the dish. I don't normally eat cole slaw, so maybe this is a thing, but I usually find theirs bitter. It's not great, but the portion on this shrunk most noticeably, probably to my benefit.   The fries are averagely tasty. Yummy in the way fries are yummy, but not particularly crispy or seasoned that would warrant a comment.   There's WiFi here, which might matter to some considering the terrible reception you get inside the restaurant. You have to ask for it and they'll print you a temporary login. It's a complicated process without a guarantee as the guy next to me and I both tried it twice to no avail.   Food might require a bit of a wait when they have bigger parties, but service has always good in my experience: friendly, attentive, and quick."}
{"text":"Love everything about Duke's. Loved the music videos playing and the choice of music. Plenty of beer selection. Great food, great service, great prices. Loved the nachos. I'll be back for sure (next time I'm in town.)"}
{"text":"I came here for a beer after a great dinner at Reds. I thought I would be here for an hour. Might be here for a few more. Wish we had this back in London."}
{"text":"This bar was a great find on our last day in Toronto. We only went to try different bears and were not disappointed. We tried the Tap Cider, the watermelon brew and 2 other house beers. The rotating tap cider was delightfully refreshing, and the watermelon beer was actually a decent combination. The waitress was very friendly and the service was fast. You also have the choice of a 1.50$ cup which is great for tasting."}
{"text":"This Bar was amazing!! The staff members were super friendly and welcoming! The bar's decor was unique and pleasing to the eyes. The food was pretty amazing! As a non- beer drinker, the bar tenders and host were so helpful in finding me a beer I would like. The prices are great, happy hour was pretty good too. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the music could of been a little better. But overall I went to this place 3 times during my 4 day stay in Toronto."}
{"text":"Dukes is right across Chelsea hotel where we stayed during our time in Toronto. As you walk, you can choose to take up any table you like. The staff is very friendly and cooperative. Interior is decorated with memorabilia and pictures. Large screen tvs with sports channel. Atmosphere was party like. This might not be a place for you, if you don't like loud music.   Right of the bat, we ordered appetizer - korean fried chicken. It was sweet, sour chicken served with some tortilla kind chips on the side. Something on the lines of orange chicken. Good start.   Next item on the list was \"chicken sandwich\" with a side of fries. To my surprise, instead of bread, our chicken was inside a crunchy cracker. Never saw anything like it. Can't deny the deliciousness. It was definitely a good choice. We couldn't finish the fries, but they were as usual and you can expect nothing interesting.   I also tried toronto's steamwhistle beer and totally loved it. Must try.   Our waiter did a great job and made sure things were in right order. Dukes also has a \"karaoke\" session where interested party can sign up for karaoke for free. It was good fun and People really had a blast doing this. Dukes refresher bar justifies its name and I totally recommend."}
{"text":"I would call this one a trendy step up from a pub.   I ate lunch here twice last week. First time was the dirty bird; huge piece of chicken breast with a very large thick deep fried crust - note to self: don't eat too much of it. The grease did not sit well in my tummy all afternoon. - the chicken itself was cooked to perfection and so moist. The coleslaw is dry, no dressing or cream sauce. I ordered a side Caesar salad and a soda. $24 + tip. The servers were not overly chatty or super friendly, I'm not sure they wanted to work there kind of vibe. Tim Hudak was there having lunch.   The second visit I ordered the Chicken Astoria sandwich that I was really looking forward to, I was underwhelmed. I got one mouthful that suggested apple was in there and I didn't get any almonds from any of my bites. The focaccia was supposed to be flavoured or so I thought. The side salad that came with it was fresh but I did not like the dressing. I ordered the maple syrup, caramel and bacon donuts; delicious. $29 + $4 tip.   The male server I had that time was engaging. As soon as I said the sandwich was underwhelming; he and I proceeded to have a foodie conversation. He even said to not judge the menu based on the two things I had for lunch and to come back and try their burger."}
{"text":"I knew I'd like this place from the second I heard the Alanis Morissette song playing when I walked in. A modern take on a 90s dive bar, with a bikini top hanging off a pair of deer antlers and a soundtrack that brought me back to my high school days, the bar brings about a refreshing sense of nostalgia.   I was quite happy when the bartender gave me the full rundown of the menu, naming all of the specials instead of the usual \"what can I get you to drink?\" that I hear at most Toronto bars. They have a pretty big selection of beer and prices that will satisfy any budget. My friend had the chicken fingers, which I know are pretty \"low brow\" cuisine, but they were some of the best I've ever had.   The space is pretty large and had a good after work crowd when I went. It would be interesting to see what this place is like on the weekends. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the trio of restaurants along Gerrard just west of Yonge.  I assumed it was the cheapest of the three but it's a toss up between it and its next door neighbour..  Like:  The social atmosphere, ambiance and set-up.  Seems like a cool place to go and have a drink or two and some food.  Cocktail list was creative.  Dislike:  10oz 'pints' of beer - what a rip off at $4-$5, meaning a full 20oz would put you up to $9-$10.  Not cool, despite the extensive selection.  Food was a bit overpriced although I would consider it 'pub fancy'.  Overall, I don't think I'd go back.  The beer price alone kind of annoys me and the place wasn't great enough in any category to justify a repeat visit.  Would rather go next door."}
{"text":"Come for the $5 specials! Awesome place for university students as the crowd is pretty young. I love the decor of the place, and the atmosphere is loud and lively. The servers are extremely friendly and welcoming. My boyfriend had the tacos and the chicken wings. He claimed the chicken wings are the best he's had so far compared to restaurants like St. Louis, Duff's and Big Slice. I recommend passing on the salad though. It was quite pricy and was alright..."}
{"text":"Holy craft beer Batman.  I love beer and this place has a wonderful choice of craft beers to choose from.  The taps of past are on the back wall where you can see the variety that they served from before.  Taps are constantly changing and some are so often they are just called taps 1 through 5!.  The menu is pretty much consistent in price all the way down which was 7.50 a pint.  The time I was there though (noon through 6pm I believe?) the prices for pints are only 5 bucks.  5 bucks!  Aren't I lucky to have a day off?  The menu is also listed by IBU rating from lowest to highest.  I didn't see anything too strong on this menu.  Amsterdam at the bottom was 65 I think?  I've been drinking stronger beers recently but the ones I had were good.    I went with the Duggers number 9 American pale ale and a Liberty Village 504 (as in the streetcar) this time.  Recently Yelp held an amazing pub crawl hosted by Evelyn in which Duke's was the first stop.  I wanted to return on my own and while the place is dead quiet at 3pm I didn't get to spend any time on the ground floor last time because the event was held upstairs.  The ground floor is filled with flat screens on the bar wall and some interesting high top seating/stools.  There are some U shaped tables almost like somebody is intended to be at the center.    So since I was only here for beer last time I have sampled the food here from the previous event and from what we had (silders, nacho board, club sandwich, chicken tacos) the menu is a nice variety of complimentary snack type foods to go great with your drinks.  Dukes has lots of nice taps to partake in.  If you like beer this place should definitely be a consideration."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most friendly and unique American restaurant I have been to at Toronto, the waitress that's been serving us is very friendly and helpful through out our entire visit, she even got us two tasty sour beer(which unfortunately I couldn't finish so my boyfriend have to do the justice and be the hippo by finishing it for me) :) this is definitely a place worth coming back."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a fun time.  Great advice from bar tenders on beers to try.  And we had our first experience with \"poutine\" here (they have several versions to pick from). Friendly local bar feel right in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Somewhere between  dive meets a sports bar? It's definitely one of the prettier \"divey\" places to hit up along Yonge between Bloor and Dundas. I've been here before, but I am so oblivious, I never even realized this place had a second floor! It's cosy and seats about 50 in close quarters. 3 TVs surround the upstairs so everyone has a view of some screen. It was great for the day I went when the Leafs demolished their opponent, promoting a jovial feeling. The beer selection is nice. The food is filling but seriously not good for your arteries. You'll find all the usual bar food staples, like poutine and tacos and burgers.  I think it's a great neighbourhood spot, and much needed considering the density of people in that stretch. If you're coming in a group, big or small, and looking for some drinks, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great venue and music. Poutine was amazing.  Craft beer selection was good but not great. Had a lot of IPAs but not much else. Staff was ok but either understaffed or just not wanting to be at work. Would definitely return during the weekend in hopes of a more lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Looking for a laid back, divey type bar feel in a large city such as Toronto, then this is your place. Location was approx. 1/2 mile from Eaton Centre Marriott and across the street from the Chelsea hotel. We walked right in, sat at the bar. The location is larger than you think from the outside with a 2nd floor, good mix of music with related videos on TVs behind the bar with sports on as well. We were quickly greeted by bar staff - Excellent drinks!!! They had a wonderful pome-strawberry mojito which may have been seasonal. I had one of their signature drinks a Derious Remonade which was a sweet yet perfectly tart drink with sour raspberry, Galliano, Lemon and Soda - tasted a little like cotton candy lemonade and I am trying to replicate it very soon at home.   My husband had a cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked perfect med-rare, seasoned well, nice and juicy. The sweet potato fries were fresh with a tasty chipotle mayo dipping sauce. I had the PBJ chicken tenders which is 3 piece boneless chicken tenders cooked on a wooden skewer with a spicy peanut sauce, chili jelly and cilantro on top which also came with fries. The salty, mildly spiced peanut sauce went perfect with the sweet chili jelly, small amount of chopped crunchy peanuts - I loved it. Their fresh fries were excellent, nice and crispy. Portions were perfect for light dinner, lunch and pricing was very reasonable for the city.   Service was fast, friendly and helpful. Loved our food choices and excellent drinks. Prices super reasonable, We will be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Nice bar and tapas place, good service, food was okay, drinks were good and fair price."}
{"text":"I visited Dukes during the first couple of months it opened with some colleagues for lunch/drinks and recently went there again a few days ago for a Yelp event and I must say that it was even better than the first time. Not just because it was a Yelp event but they usually offer stellar service and quality tasting food. It's the perfect place to go if you are looking for reasonably priced food and quality beer.  FOOD/DRINKS: Affordable, delicious, and perfectly portioned; thet serve some pretty tasty pulled pork tacos or grilled sandwich options if you are looking for something on the lighter side. They have over 40 specialty beers on tap if you're looking to find one that's smooth and crisp.  AMBIENCE: A nice relaxing and cozy atmosphere with many tables and a huge bar with tv's to come and enjoy a  drink while watching your favourite game.  SERVICE: Consistent, very efficient and friendly; always attentive making sure that your dining experience is great every time.  Come here with a group of friends to \"refresh\" yourself with some great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great wings ... good apetizers ... haven't had anything else but beer other than than that ... it's a great place to catch a game"}
{"text":"The ambiance in here is so relaxing. There staff is quick, their hot sauce is almost perfect, and drinks are great! It's the perfect place to kick back and catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"The address of this place is a bit misleading.  I walked up and down yonge st a few times before I found the entrance on Gerrard.   It's spacious with high ceiling with a very casual vibe. There was no one to seat you, we kinda just find a table that looks clean to sit down. The staff were not in any identifying uniforms so we werent sure if we should be waving for someone. The staff did eventually show up with menus. They are very friendly and helpful. At one point we enquired about an unusual drink and were given a little sample to try.   It was a very busy night so service was slow. Like I said it was a very casual place, great for chilling out. We were there primarily for drinks.  They had a large beer and cider selection and limited cocktails, reds and whites.  The tap was a popular option with my group...I personally do not know beer so I ordered a Cesar which was very good.  We had a little app to share...it was crispy Korean fried chicken, very flavourful with a lot of heat.   They serve some interesting craft beer and cider and it changes all the time. Among them tonight was cherry cider from a local brewery and rhubarb cider as well as a cream cider with a vanilla after taste. Whatever was on the board may not be available the next time you are in, depending on how many kegs they have left.  I would definitely come back another time to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Portebello and Swiss burger!!...Mmmm Mmmm Mm... I had that for lunch and it was deeeelisssh...caramelized onions and mushrooms and gooey cheese... This 3 brasseurs burger at 3 brewers cannot compare."}
{"text":"Dukes has changed quite a bit since it opened, definitely for the better.   We thought we were going to go for a quick drink or two but I got hungry and we ordered nachos and chicken tenders. Everything was soooooooo good!!! I asked the bartender if he was able to cut the cilantro out of the dish and he was super accommodating.  Now off to the chicken fingers. Also perfect. Tasted like they were never frozen. The gravy we got on the side was also excellent. Yum.   One regret was ordering the small sized nachos. Definitely could have killed a large one. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.   My friend and I randomly stubbled across this place on ubereats and were pretty blow away. We got Sweet Potato Thing (12.95), Veggie Portobello \"Burger\" (13.95) and The Angry Bird (14.45). I would highly recommend the angry bird and the unique salad they have as a side. The fried ch was oh so juicy and I loved the buffalo sauce. I would go back any day just for this sandwich!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good chicken fingers and a great selection of beers. Waitress and bartender very friendly. Busy location with young people."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! I got the Mac burger but the woody burger is by far better for you BBQ sauce lovers! Definitely get that! They do lots of variety of beers worth trying and excellent place to visit!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a waiter at a restaurant we were dining at nearby. It was a Saturday night so it was very packed but service was decent despite this. I honestly can't remember the name of the drink I got but it was tasty.   It was definitely a younger crowd--not really my scene so if I had nowhere else to go I'd try this place out again."}
{"text":"Great selection of domestic and import drafts, and the food was legit. My first ever poutine experience, and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"What brought me to this place was their beer selection. Any place that has sampling flights has my interest, and I liked that the flights are priced per sampling glass so you aren't limited to ordering them in groups of 4. There was a variety of interesting craft options in addition to the standard big brands, so on the beer front alone, I'd give the place 4 stars.  But the food unfortunately left me hanging, which is why I can't go above a 3 star average. Out of the variety of apps we tried, the Korean Fried Chicken was probably the best thing and the only thing that I was actually impressed by (although doesn't hold a candle to 416 Snack Bars). And perhaps its my fault for having higher expectations of a club sandwich, but the club sandwich was so utterly boring and flavourless. Served on regular toast with bland chicken, I mean maybe at least if it were on that bacon foccaccia the burgers and sliders are served on maybe it would have been slightly memorable, but for this to be the ending point of my meal, left me unenthused.  While I know that this area of town did need something like this place, I'm not sure I'm excited to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Ordered through Foodora. Fish and chips.  Chips were cold, Coleslaw was warm.  All three were just thrown together in the same box.  And the fish batter contained enough grease to lubricate the engines on the QEII."}
{"text":"This place was great and had an upbeat atmosphere playing an awesome nostalgic selection of 80's music along with their hilarious music videos on the TV. My husband enjoyed the craft beers being offered and I liked the appetizers we ordered though I wouldn't go out of my way to say they were anything spectacular or extraordinary compared to other bars/pubs. I would come back if I were in the area again. In fact, my husband did come back with a large group of people and said it was still good!"}
{"text":"Nachos were tasty but very small portions. Only 9 nachos for $16. The amount of portion they had they may as well take it off the menu.  Great server and God selection of craft beer on tap. But I can get those at the beer house with way more selections on tap. I went here for the food. Had to go to subway after. Got more food for $3.99 (sic inch sub of the day) than I did here. Don't be fooled by three foot long board. It's barely 3 inches wide."}
{"text":"Stopped in because reviews had said they played decent music. Was just looking for a simple place to enjoy some drinks. I had some red wine and the significant other a big ol' can of cider. He was hungry so ordered the \"ribs\"...not what he expected. Very small portion. Let's just say we had to grab a pizza on the way home.  All in all good atmosphere. Music videos playing are a plus and they had Dazed and Confused playing on a couple TV's too. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Super loud, generic chain, cater-to-the-mass sports bar. I like the interior and that's about it. Drinks were bad, service was slow."}
{"text":"I've been to Duke's Refresher twice now. Beer selection is excellent and to top it off they have $5 pints until 6pm Mon-Friday! Can't beat that for after work drinks or just drinking in general.  Their food is pretty good too. They even have $5 small plates available until about 7pm. The Crispy Korean Fried Chicken with bib lettuce is super tasty and filling enough to eat as a small snack or meal depending on one's diet. It has a good kick to it. I also tried to slippery shrimp with bib lettuce. The first time I went I tried to tuna poke and was sad to see that it wasn't available the 2nd time I visited.  A colleague ordered their poutine during La Poutine week and it was pretty good though the sour cream was not necessary.  Atmosphere is lively but not super loud that you can't hear what your friends are saying."}
{"text":"I was here for Sunday brunch. It was quite empty at about 11am and was just starting to fill in as I was leaving (12:30pm). The quiet restaurant was a nice change to the typical brunch joints in this city - no line ups!!  We ordered the breakfast poutine and \"the pig and the egg\", a $5 caesar, and a $5 beer. The poutine was much larger than in the pictures and was what my boyfriend was looking for in a breakfast poutine (he is a poutine lover). The pig and the egg sandwich was gigantic and tasty. But the real winner of this meal was the home fries that came with the sandwich which were perfectly sized (small cubes), seasoned, perfectly crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. They have hot sauce on the table that had the most complimentary spices with the seasoning of the home fries. The portions were HUGE. We couldn't finish our dishes (but came close) which is saying something because we are big eaters. And when it comes to food we enjoy, we are even bigger eaters.   I would return just for the home fries!"}
{"text":"On one beautiful Saturday afternoon, a couple of my friends and I were looking to grab some food, down a few drinks, get a nice buzz going, and watch Finding Dory. The usual. We were in the Ryerson area and instead of going to Red's or Scaddabush (both literally right next to Duke's), we thought we'd give this place a try.  I'm happy to say that we're glad we did. The patio was admittedly lacklustre (cramped and uninteresting), but Duke's more than makes up for it with an awesome drink menu. Tons of interesting craft beers and familiar brews co-exist harmoniously in the menu, and there's sure to be something to please everybody. No matter what you drink or how much you drink, Duke's will be able to accommodate.  As for the food, I had the beef tacos and I stole some of my friend's chicken tacos. They were both awesome but I personally leaned more towards my choice. Make sure to ask for guac (which unfortunately costs extra, by the way) and slather it generously onto the tacos before diving face-first.  Not my ideal choice for a first date or an anniversary, but if you're looking for something more on the casual side that won't break the bank, you're in for a treat at Duke's."}
{"text":"This was indexed under \"Sports Bars\" in yelp, and it really isn't.  That doesn't mean it's not a great hangout bar, though, just sayin'.  So, I came in to watch a World Series game here, and they did have it with the sound off at the central of five large TV's at the bar.  The other three had a roll of washed out blurry 80's rock videos, and one had a kitschy horror movie running -- they weren't even showing the local Raptors-Warriors NBA game, and I seemed to be the only one into the WS game.  Enough of that though, sports ain't for everyone I know.  What Duke's *does* have is a long rustic barroom, great selections on tap, and people seemed to be really liking the pub eats.  The bartenders were really polite, and were very cool about letting this US stranger who walked in run a tab (a lot of places in Toronto won't let you do that, I've found). Lively and loud, but not overly so.  I'd recommend it as a pub stop for pretty much anybody.looking for a fun hangout spot to chill and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Perfect for a late night beer and some delicious food! The nachos are a must try. We also had the PBJ chicken fingers, which were very flavorful. Most importantly, the beer selection seemed limitless. Wish our server was a bit more friendly, but it was quick."}
{"text":"Loud, Fun. Lively.  You can always have a good time at Duke's.  We went specifically for Trivia Night (check their site for dates/times).  They have 2 levels - the upstairs is a bit congested with the tables but definitely I prefer to sit here.  The downstairs is quite big with plenty of seating for large groups.  The service is pretty friendly and quick, which is surprsing considering how busy the place gets.  This particular visit I didn't have food (just drinks), but I have eaten here before, sliders, tacos, fried chicken.  Everything is good - nothing that a drink or two can't make better.   This place always reminds me of a cross between the old old school Jack Astor's kinda vibe (without the cheesiness) and a pub.  Definitely a great central spot if you want to just have a chill night with your friends."}
{"text":"I really really like this bar. Happy hour specials on Beer from 6pm for $5. Happy hour snacks from 5-7pm for $5. Great atmostpehere. tons of screens to watch sports. Friendly servers. Good amount of beers on tap, including many local craft beers. And the food is pretty damn good. On this particular visit, I got the Korean Fried Chicken, which isn't the KFC you would get at bon chon in the States, but that would just be asking for too much. it was nevertheless tasty and enjoyable. If this were any closer to where I live, I would probably be here every day."}
{"text":"A wide variety of beers to choose from.  The staff was very friendly and the place is well kept.  Even the bathroom smelled like pine...  I had \"The Dirty Bird\" it was delicious... didn't expect it to be so tasty and the chicken was moist."}
{"text":"Try the chicken fingers! They are bomb. This place serves up good quality versions of your favorite bar foods! Cool feel with a nice beer list. Got to try first Canadian craft beer. My girlfriend really enjoyed her mojito. Server was nice and very patient when we were not sure what we wanted to order. Would try this place again if I was in Toronto again and needed a quick bite."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was terrible!!! We were greeted by the bartender who was very nice. He told us to sit wherever we'd like. We sat down and a waitress dropped menus off without saying anything and didn't come back for about 20 minutes. She took our order and we waited another 10-15 minutes until we got our drinks. She eventually delivered our food and she never came back to check on us. We had to ask her for our check after waiting another 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Mannnn, I love this place. And trust me when I say I don't say that easily about most bars! The decor is spot-on and makes the place feel extremely cozy. Whenever I come here, the service is impeccable and the servers are always happy to talk about the specials or offer their advice on food/beer selections.  There's a huge selection of beer. Huge. And their happy hour prices are awesome. Another thing I love about this place is their beer samples in 3oz glasses - gives you the opportunity to try a bunch of different beers! Their food is pretty awesome too and the prices aren't bad at all. My favourite is the Korean fried chicken - so delicious with just the right amount of spice!"}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome beer and burgers. There was a nice crowd and nice tunes. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"40 taps? Pretty varied.. good selection.. Bartenders are friendly and crowd is pretty alright on a Sat. night too..  I'll write something more when I eat :)"}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty low the first time I visited here. Any bars located in tall condo towers usually aren't too good. Let's be quite honest in saying that they've got you right where they want you: desperate for food and beer and you don't want to go far. But this place is actually pretty good, and I give kudos to them for doing so since they don't have to be.  First off, the atmosphere is pretty good. Bar stools and high top pic-nic tables give it that no-nonsense aesthetic. It also has enough polish that you don't feel like you accidentally walked into some dive bar either. It's a bit loud on the music, hearing those around you isn't always easy, and the bar is often understaffed it seems, but the employees are very polite and friendly every time I've been there.  Food is pretty good also. It doesn't seem like a place that would make things from scratch, but they do all their prep in house and make their burgers with fresh ground chuck and no filler, according to our waitress. I had that burger the first time I went there and it was very tasty. I can't stand going to pubs and eating a frozen patty, so that was a point in this places favor.   Cheap beer can also be found here. PBR pints are $4.50 all the time! I don't know if I'd go here all the time, but it's good to go if you're in the area and are not in the mood for the Elephant and Castle.  Worth the trip"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Duke's and it most certainly will not be my last. Our group met on the 2nd level for a party organized by Itanni Betancourt through Meetup.  The theme was a Pyjamas and everyone came in in their nightly lovelies. The staff were very quick to organize us with drinks while we waited for our nibbles to arrive.  Nice variety of beer as well as a very long list of ciders which were on promotion for the evening. The atmosphere upstairs was casual and very comfortable.  Comfortable bar table seating as well as a roomy picnic table. Itanni had made arrangements for platters of food prior to our arrival.  We enjoyed a variety of platters from veggies/dip to tacos to a delicious dessert. One of my faves had to be the wings which were tender, spicy and delicious.  We munched on two different tacos, chicken and shrimp.  Both of them very tasty.  There was a variety of nachos which were nicely finished with cheesy goodness.  There was also a couple of different toasted sandwiches which really hit the spot.  A goat cheese sandwich with the lovely flavour of watercress and toasted club sandwiches which were generously laden with tons o' bacon.  Both sandwiches were delicious and beautifuly presented on long cutting boards. My second fave dish of the evening were the chicken tenders.  They arrived nice and hot with a crispy coating and oh so tender inside.  The plum sauce complimented them beautifully. Last but not least was our dessert.  Although everyone was quite stuffed at this point of the evening we could not resist the mountain of baby donuts smothered in caramel sauce and chopped bacon.  Several of those babies were enjoyed by one and all! By far one of the most enjoyable evenings our group has had and that is due to our organizer Itanni as well as the exceptional service and food of Duke's."}
{"text":"Been coming here alot of time great food great people great bartender. I love how they show old movies."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous time at Duke's last night at a \"Pajamas Party\" organized by Itanni:-).  The food was plentiful and simply delicious.  They are known for their beer but their wine selection was very good.  The Wait Staff was attentive, friendly and courteous.  This was my first time at Duke's and I will definitely return.  Such a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night - - it was quite busy and we seated ourselves. It's a very casual place with lots of young people so it can get pretty loud.  I had the chicken nachos and the chicken tacos. The nachos were good but not the typical plate of nachos you would expect at a pub. The regular board had like ~6 nacho chips, kind of dressed like flatbread: topped with seasoned chicken and shredded lettuce. Despite saucy chicken, the chips were nice and crunchy - a nice light snack. The chicken tacos (3) had bbq chicken, slightly spicy, with some sweet fruit and topped with purple cabbage slaw. Fresh-tasting and enjoyable; the food was a nice change from the typical oily pub food.  Service was alright, we just walked in and claimed a table. Only saw the waitress for the drink order, food order+serving then the bill.. no one refilled our water or asked if we wanted another drink. Nonetheless I'm not too picky on service and the food was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"The entrance is tucked on Gerrard St, so remember to turn onto Gerrard even though the address says Yonge. Look for a collection of neon lights and you will find the door easily. The space is deceptively large, with a second level and long bar to draw up one of their many mismatched chairs. The atmosphere feels like a laid back local watering hole, with eclectic lights and interesting decor (is that a tennis racket hanging from the ceiling? Yes it is.... okay.).  They have $5 16oz draught all day, you can choose from the four choices. If you want something to eat, they have $5 plates Mon-Fri 5 to 7pm for happy hour. Choose from the crispy korean fried chicken, guacamole and black bean dip, or just get all four (because why not?). If you could only have one, I would recommend the korean chicken. Bite sized, crunchy and saucy - the perfect side dish to a pint of beer. Will definitely be back when needing to get away from all the student options in the area."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars only because at least the bar and service was great. But we ordered a 'short' order nacho  (to go) and we got back to hotel it literally had less then 10chips covered in the toppings, most of which was lettuce. This all cost over $10. So I paid a little over a dollar a chip.  This may be a tourist area, but THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU GET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. Shame on you."}
{"text":"I thought that I had reviewed this place before - but thoughts can be deceiving, as can looks!  This hole-in-the-wall Kitsch bar with mismatched stools and wooden walls covered in old beer taps and random signage hearkens back to ye-olde dive-bar, but it isn't old school when it comes to food! I was here for the Canadian men's Olympic hockey game final - and the food was delicious - even though it took 2 hours to get to me - and they ran out of home fries. (okay - yes, I was upset but the place was crammed to standing-room only, the prices were reasonable, and the staff were nice, accommodating and made switches when they ran out of food.) FYI - i did not care because the FRENCH FRIES are AMAZE -BALLS! Herbs and seasoning = yum. They also had cotton candy that day - and for weekends and special events.  Today, I ended up back here on a whim as I saw a sign for $5 beers - that's all beers! Not just Canadians and Coors! I had some amazing brews: Unibroue Blanche de Chambly, Side Launch Wheat (both amazing and good options for alternatives to Shock Top or Kronenberg 1664) and Goose Island (more hoppy). I took all the beers on our server's suggestion. And all were great choices! She was fast, knowledgable and friendly - but I didn't get her name! These are $7.25 for $5 on a Tuesday until 6 - pretty irresistible!   Plus, I had the chicken nachos! And they are the BEST nachos I've had! They are not your typical pile of old corn chips, smothered in grease and sauce. This is a long flatbread/corn chip, sliced into pieces, topped with big hunks of marinated, shredded chicken, lots of lettuce, tomatoes, red peppers and onions and cilantro. All the flavours of nachos - without feeling like a gross greasy pig for eating them - and without picking at the layer of cheese-neglected bare chips and cold salsa at the bottom. Tip: i got the BBQ sauce on the side and asked for salsa. And the salsa was the perfect marriage. Really happy they gladly accommodated the requested change. Service: 5/5 (4/5 on a busy night Food: 5/5 (for price() Value (for product and size): 4/5  A definite go-to when I'm at yonge/gerrard or yonge/college. Keep up the good work - but get some matching chairs! :)"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour after work with some buds while visiting Toronto for work. Great location and great beer elections. Really cheap happy hour specials. The staff was friendly and the service was prompt. Anywhere I can get a good buzz on with some friends and have good service I am a fan off. Next time k visit our neighbors to the north I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The food and beer is nice but the service is really lacking. The guy who served me is almost mute and I was practically invisible to him. I had to order my second drink through another server."}
{"text":"Try warm goat cheese salad with hazelnuts, fig and arugula! Aaaammmmmaaazing! Service is not perfect though."}
{"text":"Great Woody sliders and Black Bean Dip. The dip was a bit on the spicy side, and it was difficult not to finish every last bit of it. Extensive beer list, a bit on the pricey side, but we would definitely return. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"People may come here for beer but I go for food and it's good. I would recommend their hand-crushed guacamole, burgers (morning glory), and their bitchin' greens. I would stay away from their crispy Korean fried chicken. Save room for dessert because their bacon caramel mini donuts are delicious."}
{"text":"I've never loved a salad more than their salad. Waiters are super friendly and when they messed brought me fries instead of salad, I didn't even say anything and they came back with salad and let me have the fries for free which was the highlight of my week. If you don't mind nostalgic pop then it's great place to chill out. But this where was my SO and I went on our first date so I might be bias..."}
{"text":"How do you make a bar that is part of a much larger enterprise not feel corporate or cookie cutter... you hire the right people.  The food works, the prices are right, but some of the long time staff make the place awesome. The come up with silly hat days, derby races, your own mug for the right price (you have to ask if there are any). My only complaint would be on the \"pint\" sizes but then again you can stick with their ever changing selection of craft canned beer - pineapple IPA (pretty awesome and who knew)."}
{"text":"Came across this place while in search for a place to dine in with friends during our staycation in downtown Toronto. Place is busy. Ambience is nice. The downside is there's quite a few servers but everyone have their own assigned table. So if you need for water fill up or napkins, takes a while to get noticed. Need to actually wave serveral times just to get their attention, some just ignores you.  Food is good but nothing really amazing. The lasagna chicken burger i ordered is something worth a try. Instead of having a burger bun, they use lasagna pasta."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Duke's Refresher + Bar.  Gord likes it there because of their craft beer selection.  They play B movies (with the sound off) on a couple TVs which are fun to watch because they are so bad!  We both ordered wings.  Gord got his lightly dusted with salt.  He said they were good.  I got mine with medium sauce.  They were good.  I took half of them home and will have for supper tonight.  Meghan was our server and she was fun.  She was attentive and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"It's weird how this place popped up on my radar but it did and I checked it out with a few co-workers of mine.  It's a great place downtown. But what I loved about it was the clientele. No dumb university frat guys being loud and obnoxious, it was mostly people who work in the are stopping by for a pint or two. Food was reasonably priced and we all had a great time.  Staff was friendly and got us seated as quick as they could. Awesome night. Definitely checking out again!"}
{"text":"Was here last week with a few coworkers. We ordered nachos for the table and they brought us this long plate with like 10 cracker-ish things on it in a single file line- they tasted great but we were hoping for a big mess of chips and cheese and salsa. The music was so loud I couldn't hear anyone speaking unless they shouted- walked away with the worst headache. Drinks were nice and cool though and the food was a pretty good price. I'd go again if they lowered the volume."}
{"text":"Was there last night before going to a Raptors Game.  It had mean a few months since I was there last.  Sat at the bar and got the same friendly service. The bartender informed me of some changes to the menu. Thankfully their excellent burgers are untouched. Tried the wings and was not disappointed: fair size, crispy and tasty. My only complaint is the lack of reception, a bit frustrating while waiting for my friend to arrive. Maybe I should just put my phone down once in a while..."}
{"text":"Staff a bit inattentive; kitschy and eclectic ambiance that played 90s hip hop. Tons of old taps decorating the place and clientele were artsy college students and young professionals  Ordered a side salad, KFC (Korean fried chicken), and a Canadian pale ale. Tasty fried chicken and very well priced pitcher. Would certainly return."}
{"text":"The location was full of people but the service was very fast and friendly. We have visited this place during our 5 days stay in Toronto and we enjoyed every minute. For Diner we took a Burger with pulled pork on it and some warm chips with a mixture of 4 different kind of cheese and some black beans. Both was served very fast and very tasty. We will come back tomorrow"}
{"text":"We came by for dinner, drinks and to watch the game  The Good: - Beer Selection, with a sizable amount of craft options - Service was prompt and polite - TVs were plentiful with good views from most seats and they were showing they hockey game  The Bad: Food! There was little to no selection or variety. I know it is a trend these days to simplify the menu and do a few things well but neither the burger nor the fish and chips we ordered were done particularly well. The burger was bland at best. Fries did not come standard with it but for an extra 2$ and change they generously provided a side of approximately 6 fries. The fish and chips were no better; the fish was overcooked and the fries while abundant, were soggy.  Conclusion Not a bad place if you are just going for beer and sports. if you want food though, you are best to try one the many other options in the area."}
{"text":"I had visited Duke's Refresher + Bar (Twitter: @DukesRefresher Instagram: @DukesRefresher  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DukesRefresher) for a Yelp event and really enjoyed the food and vibe. So when I was considering venues for a Pajama-themed event, Duke's was at the top of my list. I contacted Duke's and in my e-mail I told them about the theme I was going for, the budget I had in mind per person, and the kind of menu I was looking for. Not even 24 hours later I was contacted by their Event Specialist, Hannah Elizabeth Reynolds. Hannah was absolutely fantastic! She addressed all my questions, worked with me on a menu that worked with my budget and that included the dishes I just had to have for my party (e.g., bacon caramel donuts, chicken tacos, etc.). At the last-minute I considered changing a few menu items and even panicked when I thought there may not be enough food for my guests, but Hannah assured me that my guests would be taken care of and that we would not be short on food. She even contacted the restaurant several times to double-check things for my own peace of mind. I can honestly say that Hannah is probably one of the most hard-working, patient and diligent people I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  PLUS! Duke's donated a $25 gift card for a give away! At the end of the night guests voted for the person they felt wore the best PJs (check out the last picture!)  Details  Number of guests: 30  Cost per person: $30  Menu  Chicken Tacos Shrimp Tacos Nachos Dip and Vegetables Chicken Fingers Chicken Wings Chicken Club Sandwiches Avocado & Brie Sandwiches Bacon and Caramel Donuts Venue: Upstairs private room  Staff: 2 staff for our group of 30  Drink Specials: Ciders were $5  The Outcome...  Massive success! The space was cozy, private and conducive to socializing. But what people really could not stop talking about was the food! It was delicious, plentiful, and fresh. These were the favorites:  Chicken tacos: We loved the juicy chicken with feta!  Chicken wings: We fought for the last wing! They were crispy, juicy and the sauce had just the right amount of heat. Also loved that they were a good size! No mini wings here!  Chicken club: thick pieces of white chicken meat, lots of crispy bacon, and perfectly toasted bread. What's not to love?!  Chicken fingers: these were actually the favorite dish of the night. Thick pieces of perfectly breaded chicken with all white juicy meat.  Bacon Caramel Donuts: OMG! They were served steaming hot, and since most people were full by this point (they were served last), I made my guests try one, and then they couldn't stop eating them. They are THAT addictive!"}
{"text":"i walked in, never being there before. the bar had no chairs at it so i dragged one up as i saw some people at the bar with seats. an employee came up to me and said the bar seating was closed due to the fact there's an event tonight. cool, i understand, i guess. i sat down at a table and a man sitting beside it said \"they're going to make you move from there too.\" i thought he was joking with me! i asked the employee if it was ok for me to sit here he said yes. minutes later another employee comes up to me and says i'll have to move in 15 minutes because of the event. uhhhh, okay? i asked her if there was anywhere that i COULD sit. the whole bar was pretty much full with no seating left. she found a spot on a communal table crammed against the wall. i accepted though it was awful seating. before i could even sit another employee came up and started taking away the chairs. the previous employee questioned him and at that point i was ready to peace the shit show, so i did.    management: events are usually held to get patrons into the establishment, no? what the hell is the point when there is literally NOWHERE TO SIT?! doesn't seem like a good way to make money imo.   not a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"This has become a local favourite bar of the university and hospital network of young professionals.  I've been here on several occasions and left satisfied every time. The burgers and bar food are surprisingly tasty. It's not fine dining but hey it hits the spot and bonus points for actually trying on presentation rather than slapping it all on a plate hoping for the best . Staff is friendly and beautiful as well, but preferences will be given to regulars. Overall a nice place to hang out with the boys. Also check out the upstairs space with entertainment features and games... Good place for a date :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  I suggest the board of Nachos,  really great.  Many tap beers available.  Our waitress really hustled  despite her being the only one working a Sunday night. I recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Popped in here yesterday to take a little break from the crowds at Pride, but mostly to catch the tail end of the soccer match. We sat at the bar for a better view of the tvs. Our server came over immediately and got us drinks and for $6, a totally reasonable price I may add, I had a Pommies which was like the nectar of the gods on such a hot day! We decided to have an early dinner here and I ordered the bacon and shrimp bibimbap. It was absolutely decadent deliciousness! I also sampled a bit of The Dirty Bird which was equally good! As far as \"pub grub\" goes, this seemed pretty solid! I enjoyed myself so much, in fact, that I am heading over there again today just in time for this afternoon's soccer match and maybe so sample some of the small plates on offer. If that doesn't speak volumes, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"This was my first chance to return to Duke's Refresher after our Yelp soiree a few months ago.  I had been talking up the place to a few friends so we decided to stop in for some drinks and food after The Roots concert.  We arrived around 11pm and the place was pretty packed.  We showed ourselves to a table for 4 on the ground floor.  Our first observation, the music was way, way too loud.  Not only was it too loud, I didn't find the pumping dance jams aligned with the clientele (the music did get better after midnight but we already endured an hour of it).  Duke's has one of the best craft beer line ups I've seen in Toronto all summer.  The beer list is fantastically curated so much respect to whoever put it together.  On this specific night, a few Amsterdam beers including Boneshaker were on special for $5/pint - a bargain pretty much unheard of anywhere in the downtown area, especially on a Saturday night!  We decided to get nachos to share but were sadly disappointed when our server told us that they were out of nachos...How is that even possible for a bar/pub?  We panicked and ordered The Sweet Potato Thing ($11.85) and 18 medium wings ($19.15).    Food-wise, the Sweet Potato Thing was a large loaf of deep fried fries, sweet potato fries and onion mashed together and coated in a sweet chipotle dipping sauce.  It was heavenly.  Wings were also decent but only a consolation for the nachos we were craving.  Service was so-so.  Our server didn't check back with us that often...he seemed pretty busy.  No offering of another beer even though we sat for a good while with empty glasses.  And then the worst - no cotton candy at the end.    Duke's - I still like you but you're gonna have to try harder to make it up to me."}
{"text":"Found this bar through Yelp and I was pleasantly surprised. As an avid beer fan, they have a generous selection of beers on tap and although prices were a bit high, I'm not complaining. (The two other restaurants located on the East side on the same street charges just as much or maybe even more for local drafts).  For people who are more price conscious, I definitely think that their \"Growler\" is a pretty decent buy as its around $13 for 30oz of craft beer. Had the nachos and it was definitely different since it comes in a skillet, with sour cream and salsa on the top and bit of corn at the bottom. Remember, portions are pretty big and it was a good snack size for two people.  I will definitely be back as they had a laid back atmosphere, our bartenders were friendly and it did not have a pretentious vibe to it :)  P.S. Specials on Mon-Wed. Growlers are only $9.5 on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Great late night spot with an amazing beer selection. You may not find everything they have on their menu so be sure to ask before you get your hopes up.  Late night eats, good beer and an atmosphere of loud youthful enjoyment. Music blaring with many people singing throughout the bar as if they are a solid sounding well-trained chorus. Perhaps a Monday after work thing for the locals? It was fun and full of energy.  Ok, all I ordered was the chicken nachos and they were GREAT. Fresh, crisp and flavorful...who would have known?  Bartender pays a lot of attention to regulars, which I understand, but this is the only thing that made my experience 4 stars. Nonetheless a really great option when in the area for a late night snack."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews from Blogto and Yelp, my friend and I wanted to try this place. We were seated and there was a guy that came to our table to ask us what we would like to drink but we just sat down, we weren't ready yet and still browsing through the drink menu. He sent a girl a couple minutes after.  The girl was very nice. Engaged in conversation and tried to recommend drinks, it kind a felt like she didn't know what she was talking about... She brought us our drinks and came back to take our food order. She had a notepad and wrote our orders in and left.   It was about 45 minutes when the server comes back and takes our order again....... That was super frustrating that it took her 45 minutes to realize she did not put our orders in. Half an hour later, our food comes out and my friend's order was wrong. She ordered the burrito in a bowl. It was kinda funny because she said it twice to confirm and the server wrote it in the notepad. We were pretty starving since it took more than an hour to get our food. Which was super odd since it was a Wednesday night and not even that busy yet.   My fried chicken was alright. It wasn't greasy and enough flavor with the sauces they provide on the side. We wanted to order dessert but our server was way too slow that we just wanted to leave. She was very very nice but she messed up or order and our bill.  This is a fun place and great atmosphere, maybe worth coming back for dessert but hopefully we get a better server."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their rotating craft beer selections, and even their standard beer selection, which includes even more craft beers and many different sizes to try them in. The burgers are all great, especially the San Fran and Le French. Also really liked the breakfast poutine, which is as it sounds (tried it during Poutine Week and was a fan!).   I prefer to sit on the ground floor as I found the second floor a bit cramped and service wasn't as prompt. The patio is small, covered, and right next to some traffic, but it's there if you want to be outside."}
{"text":"Lots of brand new places cropping up at Yonge & Gerrard until the new condo tower, and this is one of them! Also Duke's is located directly across from the Eaton Chelsea hotel so convenient if you are staying there.  Duke's is meant to have a \"Muskoka\" feel, meaning country cottage type vibe. The place just opened a week ago and it was already packed at 5:30pm on a Tuesday. My brother and I were seated at a long communal table, which was okay until others arrived and crammed us up. There were lots of 2 and 4 seater tables available though.  The menu is fairly typical but has some interesting additions. I had a shrimp & bacon bibimbap dish which was actually really tasty and came served in a hot iron skillet. My brother had the \"Dirty Bird\" aka fried chicken. It was honestly the biggest piece of fried chicken I've ever seen, it was a white boneless cutlet the size of my head! My brother is a big guy and he couldn't finish it. Came with a huge portion of tasty fries underneath.  Great beer list here too and decent wine selections for a pub, glasses starting at $6 which is very reasonable.   Service was excellent considering it's just opened, and the waitress explained they had lots of extra staff on hand until they get up to speed.  The breakfast/brunch menu looked great too. Good place with a casual vibe. I dig it!"}
{"text":"I liked the food and the drinks. They usually have a decent list of local brews. They also accommodate small groups. Nice place."}
{"text":"This was a trip down to the 1980's both in music videos and movies that were being played on the multiple screens. I had no idea half of these music videos even existed. A great place to go on your own as there is no shortage of things to watch. The menu is typical pub far though for a lighter eat the vegetarian nachos were a great choice!  Slightly older crowd which could have something to do with the playlist and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good little bar. Great variety of Canadian beers and good food. They have plenty of TV's to catch any game and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the food. Or maybe it was the large amount of alcohol I had consumed by the end of the night, but I absolutely loved this place. The vibe was awesome: music was great (any place that plays Foo Fighters on repeat is cool with me), actual space looks really nice, and the food we had was awesome.  I ordered basically everything (it was cheat night). We started off with garlic fries and wings. I will say, it's hard to find a place that doesn't overcook wings, but this place managed to do it. My main meal was the burger with goat cheese. Since then, fast food just doesn't cut it for me. I don't think I can ever eat another burger again.   Also, as a rule of thumb, if I like the food, it's an auto 4 stars. The extra star is for service. We had a waitress named Yan who was just the best server I'd ever met. Always asked it we needed anything, was actually funny, and timely with everything. Even better than some fancier restaurants I've been to where I've dished out way more than I should have for tip.  Highly recommend.  EDIT: Went back here again and a waitress named Sam helped us out. Apparently every person who works here is amazing. A little service goes a long way, in my opinion."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Duke's Refresher+Bar is for sure a good addition in the neighbourhood. The beer menu reminds me of Loose Moose and after confirming with the friendly bartender and in fact they are closely related.  40 taps though impressive but almost half of them are from the \"Big\" beer company: Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Bud Light, Labatt but I am glad that they have SawCity, Kensington, Great Lakes(though not available during my recent visit), Lake of Bays and even Silversmith! That's quite impressive! (at least much better than what I have up in Markham..)  I also love the idea of sample sizes for every single draft on tap at a reasonable price of $1.29 or so! (+0.5)  The vibe here is quite laid back and if you are into friendly waitress in short tight skirts, definitely your place.    I would definitely be back when I am in the area for a sample or 2.   Tip: A little hard to spot as it is really facing Gerrard just West of Yonge instead on Yonge street."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of locally brewed beer and cider options. The service was also fantastic.   The best part was the food! Their chicken strips come in 3s and are served with a stick in the center. Almost like a pogo stick. They have a few versions and are dressed with various sauces and garnishes. Duke has basically made these strips gourmet.   I ordered the chicken parm and was pleasantly surprised by the presentation. Rather than a thick Italian bun, the chicken is served between what I assume is deep fried lasagna noodle. The serving sizes are generous and it was really good! Fries are mediocre though.   I would definitely come again to try out their other menu options."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends. We tried a few of their craft beers and I really liked the Mill St. Stout. I ordered the chicken parmesan krunch sandwich which, surprisingly, was really filling considering that I was starving. The idea of deep frying the lasagna is unique but nothing special about the marinara sauce. I think they can still add a bit of a twist to it so it can be tastier, but I guess if people go there for the craft beers, who cares about amazing food? I liked the ambiance and the server is really nice so that's a plus."}
{"text":"This place was situated directly across the street from our hotel.  It had caught my eye before we visited because of the beer selection and food menu.  Over the course of a 3 day stint, we ate here 3 times.  Yeah, that's how good it is.   To start, the ambience is great.  They have music videos constantly playing and it's not relegated to a specific genre or decade.  They played new and old videos alike.  The seating is comfortable and they have a nice long bar.    The food was phenomenal.  We had the poutine, PBJ fingers, burgers, the donuts, and the Krusty snowballs.  We ate a lot here, but it was all worth it.  My favorite thing was the poutine.    The beer selection was top notch.  I can't even begin to list all they had, but rest assured you will find something you like.  My wife enjoyed the \"remonade\" which is raspberry and lemonade.    Now, for the stars of this place-the staff.  There were two bartenders in particular who made our visit so wonderful.  Their names are Brittany and Will.  They kept our drinks full and were pleasant to talk to.  They made sure we were taken care of in every way.  This is definitely a place we will be returning to on our next trip."}
{"text":"Quality after work location... came in with a couple of work buddies for a drink to check it out.  Bright, friendly staff, good selection of drinks.  I literally was only here for about 25 minutes, but now that I know it is within walking distance of my office at Yonge and Dundas, I will plan a  much more involved visit, especially since the warm weather is on it's way.   Update:  came back last night, unfortunately our waitress didnt seem to be having a good day. Not friendly, not attentive. Although my friend ordered the chicken fingers and they were yummy.   Probably venture to new locations before coming back here again."}
