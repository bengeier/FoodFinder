{"text":"Fabulous as always. My favourite Lobster Quesadilla never disappoints. As I have a somewhat small appetite, the appetizer size dish completely satisfies me. I love having this wonderful restaurant in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Visited three times in a week alone! A true testament to how great I found this place!  The burgers are absolutely fantastic! Was cooked properly, tasted great and fresh and was served in a very timely manner.   Staff very friendly, heck. On the third visit one of the waitresses even opened the door for everyone coming and going!  Highly Recommend the Grill Gone Wild days on Mon & Tues as they have some very... different burgers on special those days. Had a great laugh ordering the Chipolte Burger without the Chiplote sauce, eek.   Oh, and a final word of caution.  The White Chocolate Brownie dessert is... huge. I was with a family member sharing that thing... we both couldn't finish it with a combined effort, it is massive!  Definitely will be returning, this place has left a very good impression with me (And thankfully it's not too far of a drive to get to as well!)"}
{"text":"Excellent service excellent quality of food. .regulars and take visitors there.  Staff very polite. . We sit in the restaurant part not the bar part. Best yam fries I've had in yyc. . Ask for the Chipotle smoked dip yimmm and the quinoa salad with fresh bluberries choice of grilled chicken salmon both excellent. .large portion no room for deserts lol friends have had lots on menu burgers chicken dishes curry. .seafood everything excellent!  More than 5 stars. .off times are best as they're busy!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was amazing.  I'm blown away this place wasn't packed.  I will return."}
{"text":"This was a random dinner (as many of mine are).  A place that was close, when hunger hit.  I remember the building in a past life as being something else (a Kelsey's??)  so there is that \"big chain with makeup\" on it element.  But while you could probably slap any number of labels over it based on appearance ... Moxies... Earl's... etc,. when the food arrived, it wasn't what you might expect.  It shone.  The meals were both delicious (salmon and chicken), and in substantial portions, so you you could actually enjoy the MAIN that you had your eye on.      Hold on a just a sec, I need to say something:  When I look at a menu, and I order a main, it's because THAT ONE ITEM IS WHAT I WANT.   I DON'T want to have to eat 17 courses just to be \"full,\" and teased by a \" 2 ounce main\" for $50.    That's what i loved about this place --  they brought it, in the sweet spot that I wanted.  Exactly what I was hoping for, and enough that I didn't leave wishing I had more.   Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 14/30"}
{"text":"Ate off the gluten free menu. Was great being able to get a menu just for gluten free. Removed all the stress of interpretation. Had the half ribs. Everything was amazing.  Food was great. Our waitress was fun. Good place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a decent restaurant in the city that is affordable and has quality food. I use to love going to the Montanas across from Phoenix but after countless disappointments i decided to cross the parking lot. I am so glad i did! I had the 8oz steak at Phoenix and it was amazing. It was juicy, tender and the spices were delicious. They must have an amazing chef because my steak was cooked perfect and wasnt charboiled. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant and i cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, I knew we were going to eat well - it was just something about the overall ambiance. I read the owners story in the menu about being local and supporting local which is rare and added to the overall experience.  The burgers were amazing! It is definitely a spot to enjoy time and time again :) great service too!"}
{"text":"Went for a wonderful lunch today!  Couldn't believe how busy it during lunch time! Immediately thought that the wait time for ordering food and eating would take at least a 30 minutes.  There was 6 of us and hoped to be in and out relatively quick - so we could get back to work.  Although I have been here a few times, I never visted during lunch.  Needless to say, the experience was phenomenal.  Our order was taken, food served, eaten and paid - all done within and hour or so.  Fantastic service.  Amanda was our server and she was awesome!  Funny, courteous, kept on asking how our food was and refilling our drinks!  Defintely a spot to visit for a business lunch, a intimate date or just hanging out.  Location is prime!  A sweet place to visit before the movies or after.    Great Food. Great Service and Great Atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been here three or four times. Don't expect to be in and out in a short period of time. The food is ok but for the prices they charge I would expect to be a lot better."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a small bite to eat after attending a movie screening nearby. It was after 9 so the bartender took our drink and food orders even though there were plenty of servers still around. I was very please with the generous 9 oz. pour of my Sav Blanc, while hubby had a small 14 oz. pint of beer. I guess that is an 'American' pint. We ordered the Brie, Apple, and Walnut Quesadilla, salt n pepper boneless ribs, butternut squash ravioli with burned butter and sage sauce. The food arrived in a decent amount of time and was decent. I loved the flavours in the quesadilla as the walnuts were nice and fresh and added a pleasant crunch.  We finished our food and the plates were efficiently taken away but after that it took a while to get our final bill as the bartender's friends had arrived. We eventually stood up and started putting our jackets on which prompted him to hand it over.   I would probably go again if I was in the area. I've tried the Phoenix Grill closer to my area and I really like that location better."}
{"text":"Really awesome place. I don't know why some of the users gave it a lower rating, because the food is pretty delicious. I tried  the mozza burger on special on Tuesday. Really friendly server. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have eaten here a few times. It's right by my house, so when she visits me, and we are craving a good burger or wrap, we trek over here. I've never had bad service here. The waitresses are all very polite, and the managers often come by to make sure you're enjoying your meal. I usually get the burger, and though it was a bit overcooked the last time I was there, it is pretty consistent. If you want a quick meal that hits the spot, this is definitely your best bet."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner one Wednesday night and our evening began on a high note when one of the waitstaff held the door open for us.  I don't know about everyone else, but that's never happened to me before.  The excellent service continued throughout the evening.  I ordered the butternut squash raviolli from the appetizer list and was able to get an entree size.  It was absolutely delicious!  I'm a raviolli conosuer and this was excellent.  I was unable to try anything else, but everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal.  The excellent service was a highlight.  Great place, I wouuld return."}
{"text":"I went to check out this place an it was great I had the salmon wow great food service was really  good my server NIKKI  was amazing very down to earth very friendly I think I will be back"}
{"text":"The service was 5 star but the food not so much. We had the ginger beef to start which was excellent but the main courses we both got failed to impress. I got the Santa Fe pizza which had way too much of this gross  avocado cream squirted on top with what seemed to be lunch-meat quality chicken strips. My spouse ordered the baja salad which had the same kind of chicken on it too. It's just mushy, gummy and almost feels under cooked and unnatural and cheap. Besides that though, we had an overall decent time. Probably would only go back for the ginger beef!"}
{"text":"The vibe in this place was really dead, however, the service was good  I enjoyed the stake, but my wife did not enjoy her noodles......so got some mixed reviews"}
{"text":"Went recently with my kids and the food was so just ok. Could have made a better burger at home with a frozen burger. Nothing exciting and way too expensive to be worth it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4-5 times and have not been disappointed in the food nor the service. The wait staff are attentive and food comes out quickly.   Food is fusion, mex, thai, mediteranian....so lots to please almost any very palate I think.  Nice sophistocated atompshere.  I will be back:)  Question though why is it  called Phoenix Grill?"}
{"text":"People who love shopping in malls for hours will love this place. Airport quality food at airport prices."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for lunch after her crappy morning at the office and was greeted by our smiling waitress saying four sweet words 'wine is on special. . .' (Tuesdays) Yay!    After reviewing the menu, I decided on their special - Organic Turkey burger w slaw & mango relish accompanied by Truffle Parmesan Shoestring Fries.    The burger rocked!  It was perfect.  Moist and succulent on a whole wheat bun.  The fries however sounded too good to be true and were basically shoestring fries with a slight dusting of parm served with a creamy dipping sauce.  Where was the truffle...? (I should've listened to our waitress) Either way, the burger was so damn good it didn't matter.    Wine & burgers - both on special.  Wicked."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED & UNAPPETIZING  After a tasty  food experience here before, we decided to be back for more. Alas, it wasn't worth it this time . We find the food overpriced and tasted mediocre. Hubby's burger is dry, tomatoes, Lettuce and other toppings didn't  taste as fresh. And the worst , having a half cooked rice on a curry rice bowl. We were Extremely disappointed since we seldom have a date night, but with this experience, we'll never go back.. the only nice part  is the wonderful waitress we had and the hostess who opened the door when we took our exit, thus the 2 stars.."}
{"text":"My perception of Phoenix Grill was altered after my experience here. I was expecting something a little different than it was. Although it still felt like a chain to me (somewhere between earls and moxies) I still enjoyed the service that was provided to us. We ordered a couple drinks and a few sharing plates, I was not blown away from the food when it arrived however. We had the lobster quesadilla, crab and artichoke dip and the calamari.  The calamari was really weird and overly deep fried... it almost looked like popcorn shrimp. The lobster quesadilla was lacking in flavour and something about it was really off. The dip was tasty, but can ever go wrong with this kind of dip? I think not! Our server was nice and I have to say I liked the atmosphere. I would like to come back and try something else and hopefully have a better food experience."}
{"text":"Came here last week for the first time. We were greeted and seated right away.  We ordered some happy hour specials. Drinks and apples were really good! The size they give u was decent not like the teenie tiny happy hour size. My Only complain would be the ginger beef was a bit too fried that it was really hard. Still good tho but it was hard to eat.  Other than that it was an overall great experience and will definitely come back. Our sever was very pleasant."}
{"text":"It was okay. Your basic family friendly place. Service was exceptional.   Fish tacos were amazing. Turkey burger not so great. Was starving and I couldn't finish it. Prices à little higher than expected."}
{"text":"For years being going here ... years! The portion keep getting smaller and the management doesn't care When i called the place and asked for the owner call back ... no, courtesy to call back  disrespectful ; no worries i wouldn't  complaint   We just will never enter your resturant again  !!! We lived in the area all my life ... many other restaurants that deserve our money"}
{"text":"Mom got the brie quesadilla and dumplings. She enjoyed hers. I ordered a burger. It arrived cold. Cheese wasn't melted or anything. Sent it back. They remade it. Our waiter lingered and chatted with the other tables while the second making of my burger lingered in the window. It was a little bit warmer than the first time but completely tasteless. Pretty sure they are frozen patties. I've had better frozen patties from superstore... sent it back a second time. They did remove it from my bill atleast and apologized.  I also had purchased $50 in gift certificates for my mom for Christmas being sneaky about it. He then shows the bill to us on the table obviously. Luckily she didn't notice the extra $50 on the bill I was trying to pay without her knowing.  She loves the place. But I will never go back.  I'm still hungry..."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Every time we have been the food has been great. Service is ok. Some of the servers are awesome and on the ball, others are just not interested in serving you at all. Have come in the odd time and the bar area smells a little like wet old dish rag so that's not the most appetizing but despite that and the hit and miss servers we still go fairly often because the food is so good. They have an open kitchen line as well so you can see how the food is prepared which I enjoy."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  Came here with a group of my friends for a dinner on a Friday night and it was pretty busy as expected. My first impressions of the restaurant was that it was beautiful and warm. The restaurant reminded me of Joey Tomatoes except Joey's has hotter waitresses and the food is better which is a lot to say since Joey's is a chain restaurant and I'm usually not a fan of them.  The room is dimmed and warmly lit with nice brown and tan hues on the walls. There are fireplaces scattered around and I really liked their placement of the bar which was the focal point of the restaurant. Our server checked in on us every now and then, and the food came out reasonably quick for such a large group and busy night.   There is only one word to describe the food. Okay.. well more like a couple. It was very bland and not very good. My bf ordered the Jambalaya Penne ($16.25) which was really bland and not spicy at all. Coming from someone who would eat anything and think it's good, this is a bold statement haha. Anyone could make better tasting pasta from a jar. The only thing I liked about it was the inclusion of black beans and corn for an added texture and the pasta was cooked al dente. Two of my friends ordered the Seafood Linguini ($17.25) and they didn't really enjoy it. One of them had to add tabasco to bump up the flavour. I chose the Yellowfin Tuna ($20.25) with a black pepper sesame seed crust, coconut jasmine rice, roasted vegetables, and a balsamic teriyaki glaze. My first impression of the dish was that the presentation looked nice, but I soon became disappointed upon inspection. Their 'roasted vegetables' was four pieces of asparagus sitting on top of a big mound of rice. The tuna itself was cooked perfectly to medium rare with a melt in your mouth texture, but the crust and heaping drizzle of glaze completely destroyed and hid the true flavour of the fish. I did however enjoy the rice which had a wonderful coconut flavour.  Overall, I suggest you save your money and tastebuds and avoid this place. The price of the food is definitely not worth the quality."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star rating... but this place is well deserving of it.  The food was excellent!  I came with my husband.  We ordered the Bistro Chicken with gnochi in a mushroom cream sauce with asparagus and the Cajun Tilapia with Cous Cous and asparagus. Both dishes were well presented and DELICIOUS!  Coming from the city by the bay (california) I am use to great food.  This place could compete with restaurants in SF and survive... Our server was Jenny and she always checked in with us and we were greeted by very friendly staff.....   We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hit this place up before going to a late-night movie with a  few friends. The food was very mediocre. The service was great even though we had a large group. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Very salty, I expect some but this was ...over the top, service good, prices high, dumplings  and a noodle dish with tip $45  Bills Peking House was closed just down the road otherwise would have gone there instead"}
{"text":"I love Phoenix Grill! It's my go to place for an easy lunch or dinner out. I have never had to wait a long time to be seated, and the food always arrives fast! Everything I've tried on the menu has been good. I'd definitely recommend the Phoenix Grill to others."}
{"text":"Perfect service, food somehow is mediocre, fair enough if you feel hungry and just want to sit back"}
{"text":"Last night, I had the pleasure of having dinner with two dear friends at the Phoenix Grill. This restaurant is very big, and steady, but not swamped.  I will definitely consider it for large groups, since It seems that it would be easier to get in.  The waitress was awesome.  She was friendly, bubbly and competent, and we joked all night with her.  I had the red Zinfandel wine, with a berry quinoa salad.  It didn't look as good as Kendra's chicken quesadilla, but I forced myself to make a healthy choice, since this time of year lends itself to lots of overeating.  The salad had ginger flavored dressing, which I loved, and more spinach than quinoa, which is better for my waistline.  The fresh berries were blueberries, which are my favorite.  This restaurant has standard American cuisine.  As you can see from my menu choice, they do have healthy vegetarian options.  I also topped the salad with shrimp for $4 more, and I received a healthy portion.  The quality and atmosphere is casual, which makes it a great family restaurant.  We also overheard a poor soul being subjected to a loud happy birthday song from all the staff.  So you may want to skip this place if you are looking for a romantic dinner.  However, good food and variety, with fast seating and good service is what you can expect here for your more casual dinners out.  22/30"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff, and delicious food.  I had the steak sandwitch that was suppose to be medium rare and came well done.  They handle it very well and I had a new sandwitch done properly.  One of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great service!  We were a party of six plus a 7 yr old and the owner found a great table for us and we had a great time!  The food was really good!  Fresh ingredients and perfectly cooked. I had the club. Beautiful chicken breast on a fresh bun. Very tasty and interesting with smoked bacon!  Two of the girls had the lobster quesadilla and they raved about it!  The others had pizza, ginger beef and salad were all fantastic!! Very clean Very professional. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great lounge for a drink before catching a movie, and great restaurant that's fancy enough but also okay for the kids."}
{"text":"Ok, read all the great reviews, but I can't see they are that good. My apologies for this one.  Stopped in for dinner, got a 14 oz beer called a pint..... Sorry a pint federally is 20 oz, but provincially should be at least 16... Paid 6.50 plus tax...  Ok, fine... Let's look at the menu... Hmmmmm... Nothing really lept out at me except the prices... There a bit steep.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not cheap! I am here on a company expense account and I can have anything I want, but seriously the menu did nothing for me.  Yes the place was friendly, clean, nice staff... We just were not a fit.  Drank the beer and left. Not something I do.... Normally.  So I went up the parking lot to Hudson's and enjoyed a wonderful 4 dollar PINT! 20 oz.. FYI..... And a fantastic steak sandwich.  Sorry, won't go back here..."}
{"text":"Great place to go and eat. I've gone to eat here many times and never had a bad experience. The staff are friendly and treat you like family. The owners of the establishment make sure to come out and say hi to customers and to make sure they're having a great time. Food is delicious, I highly recommend the Butternut Squash Ravioli for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"I admit that I was a pleasantly surprised by my experience here, since it seemed a lot like your typical \"high-end\" chain - overpriced, small portions, and unremarkable quality. Keyword seemed.   Let's just say I wasn't expecting much.  Coming in through the door though, the hostesses were very friendly, and they even managed to oblige us right away when we requested for patio seats.   They even threw us a male server for us to flirt with all night, as we pleased! (Just kidding!)  Anyway, I ordered the chicken quesadilla because... it was chicken and because, to be honest, I didn't trust the \"fusion\" options on the menu. I was surprisingly amazed by how moist and tender it was.   Overall, my meal was quite tasty; adequate portions too. Definitely better than I expected.  I'll be thinking of stopping by again when we're in the area, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I order the beef barley and Brie. My niece order the Chicken tenders. We asked to have everything at the same time; however, the beef barley was too salty. I had to add a cup of water to eat it. My niece wanted gravy with her potato. So, she never got her gravy. My Brie, I was told was burnt in their oven.  Really, if they didn't want us to return. They did an excellent job.  I know they tried. I just didn't appreciate their forgetfulness."}
{"text":"Nice place to order some meals to share, Phoenix sunrise(?) martini was pretty good too.  We have never really had a meal we haven't enjoyed here. It's a nice restaurant but somewhere where we also don't feel uncomfortable bringing our youngest son. We however can't afford to bring all four kids as we've been told there is no actual kids menu. They are good with ensuring a smaller plate of chicken fingers are available at a discounted rate for our toddler and never make us feel like this is in anyway putting them out. The servers have always been quite helpful and happy, pleasant overall atmosphere.  Normally busy but we've never had to wait for a table with the three of us. A nice, slightly hidden, gem."}
{"text":"After a morning of geo-caching around Fish Creek Park we searched out a place to stop for a late lunch and ended up at the grill.  Firstly they don't have a kids menu and so we had to order full meals for kids who might eat 3-5 bites. And it's not cheap. My son had one choice of pizza and that was margarita....it came and was huge. My daughter was able to order half of a penne alfredo and still left with the plate half full, husband ordered a burger and I had one of the specials, butter chicken tacos in crisp won-ton wrappers...with..wait for it...a pineapple salsa made with canned pineapple.  The dish lacked everything and the obviously canned pineapple very disappointing.  We buy fresh pineapple all the time so it's readily available Everywhere in Calgary.  The staff were friendly and the place decent but there was nothing memorable about the food or experience.  That coupled with kids having to order off an adults menu will not have us returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Great service but the food I had was pretty average.  The best thing I had was their Asian noodle bowl and I will say that got better the more I ate it. If I was rating separately I would say the food was 3-3.5 and the service was 4-4.5. Our waiter was very attentive and we actually had a waiter open the door for us on the way out, which I was very impressed by. He definitely went above and beyond. And an additional tip, the white chocolate brownie doesn't taste as good as it sounds."}
{"text":"I ended up here by sheer accident as my car was breaking down.  I had a long day halfway into my road trip from Alaska to Illinois when my clutch began to give out.  I was greeted warmly and professionally by the hostess, who was genuinely friendly (not fake friendly like some places can be).  My waitress was just as kind, welcoming, and helpful.  I tried to smile and be friendly back, but when I was asked how my day was going - well, honestly not so well but I'm going to try and enjoy my stay here!  They brightened my day with not only their attitudes, but also with a wonderful surprise I will never forget.  Thank you to those employees, you are real gems!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and their staff are always friendly and attentive. We've gone here many times and have always left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Not too bad average place.  Think airports, or something like that. You are busy with your own business, need to eat, don't want that to be a fast food, then notice a restaurant near by, drop in, get seated, eat something, it's okay, you walk away and are gone.  What was the name of that place again?  I won't remember unless I wouldn't take a note on my phone while in.  Please don't take that as \"don't go\" type of review - I think Phoenix Grill is quite ok, but I am struggling to recall what was it about. Something they call \"Canadian food\", which apparently means something like hockey bar fare - a bit expanded on main course plates.  Would I come back, if hungry? Sure. Would I dream about inviting my friends there? Not at all. Co-workers? Why not. That kind of thing."}
{"text":"Ate dinner last night with my husband and mother in law.  Both my mother in law had steaks, my husband had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap with Cesar salad.  He said his wrap was good, and was good for the price (which I think was around 15$) The 8oz steak was not great - it was well seasoned and tasted OK, but both our steaks were overcooked (we asked for one medium rare, one medium - both seemed well done to me - no pink throughout). The side of veggies was not what I expected - steamed broccoli which seemed frozen and very overcooked (mushy).  I think I would revisit this place, but I would definitely order a sandwich or burger, which looked good on other peoples plates. This is not the place to order a steak dinner!!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm impressed.  I had an absolutely delicious dinner here tonight, being the Grilled Summer Salmon (from what I'm assuming is the special seasonal menu).  It was absolutely packed with flavors from items such as the sweet chili tomato-cucumber relish and sauteed vegetables.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing because it was a massive serving of food, but I couldn't stop eating.  Everything seemed so healthy that I didn't care about the painful outcome to follow.  All of my friends really enjoyed their meals too and a few E&J Gallo wines were on special for $6.50/glass.  Not too shabby.  I like the tasteful and casual, moderately lit atmosphere and our server was very friendly.  He handled our table of animated women very well.  I could have used more water refills but I was unusually thirsty.  Apparently it took a bit long for our food to arrive because someone came to apologize to us, but being that it was a group of Chatty Cathys, no one noticed.    The menu is large and varied so based on my first experience, I will not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Th service was outstanding. The meals were deliscious. 4 of us had different entees and all were deliscious. We will go back and try other entree on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  The menu is tired and uninspired!  The room is dated and the service ok at best.  I won't return, there are to many places that really good to give my business to a company that appears to not care"}
{"text":"THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI + LOBSTER QUESADILLA!!!   I just ordered off skip the dishes from this place and this was my first time trying Phoenix grill so I ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli = 10/10 The lobster quesadilla = 9.5/10 The beet and arugula salad = 7/10 The calamari = 8.5/10 (Joeys calamari is better but their two sauces that they give are delicious)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Might be one of my favorites in Calgary. Love that the menu is so extensive and that there is lots to choose from. I really like the rice bowls, and have had a very good steak here also. The drinks are always delicious and obviously made by bartenders who know what they are doing, and the desserts are awesome too! We've always had very friendly and attentive waitresses as well. Prices may be a little on the high side, but as someone from rural Iowa, everything in Canada is expensive by my standards; and with that being said, you get what you pay for! Very impressed with Phoenix."}
{"text":"I knew going in that this place was similar to Moxies and Earls. The atmosphere definitely feels like Moxies, but it's much brighter with natural light and I like that. I wasn't totally impressed with the food. I didn't love it but definitely not terrible. The redeeming quality that would bring me back was the service. Our server was friendly and took care of us well. I'd be willing to try Phoenix Grill again for drinks and apps."}
