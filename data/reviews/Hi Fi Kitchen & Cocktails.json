{"text":"So I really love this place, probably one of my favorite places in Old Town. The bartenders actually know how to make a good drink, the music is really good, the type of people this place attracts are definitely more classy than some of the other bars in the area, and they have nice VIP sections that are actually worth paying for. 

Its nice, but not so high in that its not fun or overly exclusive. 

I will say the one downside to this place that it is usually so crowded that it can be hard to get a drink from the bar, but I will also say that the bartenders are hot."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!!! Not only do they literally take your driver license (my other girlfriends had this happen to them in the past) if you don't pay attention when coming in, but they charge you even more for drinks that you didn't get!!!! Should not be charging people extra money for things they didn't sign off on!!!!! Now I have to file a claim. Such a disappointment. I have so many friends who work here and so many that like to come out. I am telling them all never to come here. Screw a place that steals from customers. What a sad joke so desperate you charge customers extra. I was forced to put one star in order to post this. This place could rot in hell for all I care"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars only because I love the music! Everything else sucks from the security at night to the bartenders.  I've gone to this bar many times and never had problems till last night. I was trying to ask the security guy if he was going to move the table and he says yeah and proceedes to push me of the ledge where the VIP tables are at. When he goes to move the table he pushed the guy standing there and they almost started fighting. Throughout the night I continued to see the same security  guy push people around like he owned the place. Not to mention that a lot of the people who work there think they can just push people around. I get that it's a club and you kind of need to be a little aggressive when walking through but you don't have to push people. 

Also watch your drink prices. I was told my drink was 8 dollars and when I got the ticket they charged me 9 plus the taxes so it was $9.72. I went on the other side of the bar and ordered the same thing and the lady charged me 8 dollars. I know it's only a dollar but when you have a couple drinks and keep paying that extra buck and tipping they can easily get an extra 20 bucks out of you.  I have no problem paying if the drink is 9 but what it comes down to is the bartenders are over charging for drinks."}
{"text":"Came once when they first opened and I have to say while the venue was appealing the service sucked. Friends came in to town and I decided to give it another shot today. The brunch menu was amazing and our server was on top of it. She was bubbly and super cute. The manager came by and chatted with us for a second, polite, which was something we hadnt experienced yet. She recommended the Reuben for the next time we come back. 

Foods good, drinks are great. Keep this up and we'll come back"}
{"text":"Awesome place with some not so smart people working there. Sat at the bar and was helped right away. I ordered a beer and it was this girls only order at the time and she delivered it to the waitress pass. So I sat with out a beverage for about 5 minutes while it sat across the bar from me. All while she picked at her zebra tights that seemed to bother her backside all night. She finally returned to me and asked if I had ordered yet... I was like yes you took my order and put my beer over on the other side of the bar. She apologized and got the beer for me. 
The bar is awesome. Good music, tv's, patio, and good draft beer selection. 
Another girl then proceeded to try and change the channels on the tv's at the bar. She turned one off the suns game to a Spanish karaoke and another game to a knife info-mercial. She couldn't figure it out and kept pointing the remote up to the security cameras at the bar. She eventually gave up and turned the tv off. I just wish I had recorded this for YouTube. 
Overall a cool new place and will be back for a drink and some laughs I'm sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff and the atmosphere are so great and the food is yummy too! I always have the best time experience here."}
{"text":"Dear HiFi, 

You have a phone stealer.  Take care of that.

Thank you,

{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. There was no line or cover and I now know why. I was out with a group of girlfriends for a girls weekend and wanted to find fun nightlife. Landed at this place and AWEFUL doesn't begin to describe it. They bump loud dance music with no dance floor and have incredibly rude staff. Waited 20 minutes at the bar to be passed up for drinks by the same bartenders multiple times with no acknowledgement. When I stepped in to flag down the bartender after waiting for so long, she gave me a rude glance and continued to pass me and others by. Extremely disappointed - spend your time and money elsewhere and save yourself the trouble!!"}
{"text":"Still haven't been here on a weekend , but I know Wednesday and Thursday night are great! Also if you're just looking for a place to kick back after work and have a drunk and some food I suggest the grape fruit beer with a shot and the tweeter!! A healthy option to go with your beer! :)"}
{"text":"Door guy was best member on entire staff!  We walked in, sat on patio, cocktail waitresses ignored every single person on patio, we finally went to bar to order a drink.  When at bar we saw a manager talk to the waitresses and tell them to quit chatting with each other and help the customers, we had already gone to bar so did not need them then (of course they didn't return when we could've used another round).  We then went to bar for another round and the bartenders did same as waitresses.  After a 15 minute wait to be acknowledged, mind you it was dead on Sunday evening, a bartender finally helped us.  We asked to speak with a manager just to let him know how terrible service had been, the manager came out and said you are drinking so I won't talk to you and he just walked away.  This place is the \"jersey shore\" of Scottsdale, don't waist you time here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. If you plan on getting timely service this is not the bar for you. 

However, the environment and food are excellent for groups.  Came here to get on my March Madness and just left with Madness"}
{"text":"Food was good. Our server was good. The quality stops there. We came here on Sunday to watch football with the rest of the crowd, and to all of our surprise, they had a DJ come on at 3pm and start blasting music on a richter scale that would make Daft Punk cringe. Everyone at the bar was verbally pissed and upset, but to everyone's surprise the manager refused to turn the music off, let alone down at all! Even with half the bar begging for it... The manager claimed that he had no authority because they already paid the DJ. Terrible customer service. They lost more money from the people that left (and the horrible reviews to follow) then they ever would have if they had cut the DJ off. It's not like the DJ brought anyone in either, the place was packed with football fans before he ever took the stage. A good manager would have recognized this. Multiple tables ended up leaving, including ourselves after the 1st quarter of the afternoon games because the sound and atmosphere was unbearable. 

All in all, it was a horrible experience, and the manager was completely inept and useless. He refused to do anything and snubbed us off as if we were crazy for even suggesting the idea. Apparently they have a house DJ come on every day at 3pm. I can't stress enough how terrible of an idea this is. It's not a club, especially at 3 in the afternoon. There's no dancing space, and the atmosphere doesn't match at all. I have no idea what vibe they're trying to go for, but they missed the beat completely. Maybe they're trying to fit in with the old town club scene, why on a Sunday afternoon is beyond me. We will never come back here, and I would highly recommend no one else does either. (That is, unless you're looking to make your ears bleed). 

It was all very unfortunate because they had huge projector screens and a good amount of tv's, which was why everyone came in the first place. The management here needs to figure out what the hell they want to be and stick to it, because whatever they're doing sucks something awful."}
{"text":"All roads lead to Hifi!! This establishment produces some of the best entertainment! Sunday Funday with Dj Convince is always a great way to end your weekend! It will get packed so I call ahead and get a table for Night and or day parties.

If you're going to Scottsdale to have a good time, you have to go to HiFi. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"We reserved a table and a bottle of vodka here for a bday party for $400 and at midnight we were told there was a 2 bottle minimum. We disagreed and the manager was sent to our table. The manager, Drew Young, told us it wasn't his problem that the girl who bought the bottle didn't understand English, and that unless we bought a second bottle we would be escorted out of the bar. We asked to see the contract stating a second bottle needed  to be purchased, and he said he didn't need one because he had a popular bar with people who wanted to spend more money than us. He then had security escort us out of the bar. I, in the nicest way possible, explained that we bought a $400 bottle of Kettle 1 with no contract stating we had to buy two bottles, and he still had security kick us out and said we could \"wait in line to get into his bar from now on.\" Never been so disrespected before, and never going back to Hi-Fi"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here until now. I reserved a table a week before an event and they gave me a price and we agreed. A few hours before the event they text me and raised the price. I agreed to it again and they guaranteed nothing else would change. Moments before the event they contacted me telling me we are no longer getting the table because it was a high demand even though I already had it reserved it a week prior with confirmation. I was extremely disappointed. They cared more about making more money than being true to a customer. We ended up with nothing that night so they definitely ruined everything. Everyone involved will not spend any more money there and the word will go around"}
{"text":"While having lunch at Rehab, we asked the locals where to go on a Sunday night. \"Pickle\" said \"Hi Fi\" is the place to be. For a Sunday night, this place was packed! (It didn't seem like there were any other places nearby that were open beside some sports bar). We arrived around 10pm and there were already plenty revelers. No cover, woohhoo. I'm from southern California and it reminded me of Hermosa Beach...Sharkeez Hermosa or American Junkie aka douchebag heaven (made me LOL to read the other reviewers). The DJ played an eclectic music selection for all dancing types. The layout is well designed with indoor booths, outdoor seating and flat screens, an impressive pin-up mural above the bar and decent sized dancefloor. The right wall with subwoofers was pretty sweet. I know where to party if I visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Scanky waitress had to get her manager to check our out of state IDs even though we are over 23. Drinks too forever our friends sat for 30 min and didn't get served at all. Couldn't find our waitress to pay our tab after walking around the place multiple times. Left money under the table 3-4 dollars more than each drink cost. Watched a buser clear the table/money then the manager came to accuse us of not paying. Won't be back..."}
{"text":"I had a great time here with friends, our server was sweet and really attentive. Good music, nice people, great environment and great pretzels and mimosas! I would recommend for anyone to come here on a Sunday during the day for a chill time to have some drinks and enjoy the day."}
{"text":"One star for location ... However this place  treats customers like yesterdays lunch ! What a  Horrible experience i had as I watch them escort a beautiful family from the corner booth ( literally with the securities hand gestures to \"GET UP!\") As they left we asked the customers what happened ?... they told us that security told them loudly \"this booth has been bought you have to get out of the booth\"  with there drinks in hand they just stood around . Low and behold 20 minutes later WE WERE NEXT !  I was soooo embarrassed and blushing with humility. I will never come to arizona again because of this experience! YES NEVER! !    I strongly advise tourist to avoid this rude and untactful lounge !"}
{"text":"Service is bad - you can tell they don't really care about working there. Drinks are good, food is alright. Prices are misleading - got charged extra for items listed as included in the meal. Told my server and she just said yea sorry it's extra even though it doesn't say. Great, so you knew and didn't tell me and it doesn't say on the menu. Pretty messed up don't you think? Fix the service and menu is my advice - it's pretty terrible."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here to watch an Iowa game; both great experiences. The waitress was friendly and efficient, the drinks were reasonably priced and the bar food was very good. I had the endless mimosas with grapefruit instead of orange juice; with food order a huge bargain at $15. The turkey burger was hands down the best I've ever had in a bar, with good fries and a tasty sauce on the side. My son liked his Mac and cheese dish and my husband raved about his chicken BLT. We were there for several hours and a lot of drinks; bill total was very reasonable. We'll be back next year."}
{"text":"While attending with my girlfriend a few months ago,  I witnessed a few people fall victim to this, testosterone fueled drunken overly packed discriminatory public venue. 

The Fire Department has to check this place for max-capacity limitations. Very small, the venue packs drunken testosterone filled spray tanned
patrons into a room, so they cant move. This allows the bouncers to antagonize the customers, they dont like. I guess they can kick you out for pushing and fighting and all your doing is walking and trying not to get trampled over.  While standing on the outskirts I noticed girls and waitress fall off the VIP stage, hurting themselves, breaking ankles and splashing drinks on innocent bystanders.

The manager, is a curly head Bryant Gumbel looking tight woad,  with a bill belamy relaxer perm, he really tries to fit in on this side of town and it shows.  He begs for acknowledgement, and everyone see's it.   He talks to the waitress and the young girls that work for them,   like they are his little children, telling them get to work. Stop talking!  Total buzz kill,  he seemed very unprofessional in public. 

The way VIP is set up is dangerous, little hostess tight rope on a 8 inch beam, while serving drinks to drunken, Pally D wanna bees .  This place is a lawsuit ready to happen. Especially if a fire or fight breaks out wow, problems!  

The hostess fall off the stage and spill drinks on the customers. While the bouncer and the managers walk around as if they are Robo cop, with microphones,that allows them to speak to someone through the ear pieces, all while getting paid a whopping $10.25 an hour! 

Please steer clear of this establishment, at least while the current management and staff are in charge. This is not a welcoming environment at all. You will witness, managers and staff intentionally use harassing rhetoric to escalate violence with customers, that are already under the influence. Very confrontational communication styles.Only because the Police are out front.  

The interaction with staff is less friendly and more in your face, pushy and antagonizing.    I had a friend get arrested here a few months ago from back east,  oops their mistake, he is a practicing 10 year attorney, they will be changing staff sooner then they think at this location. 

Overall this place feels like the wrong side of town. Good luck to you all."}
{"text":"I wish no stars were an option...
I came to the block party and visited this place. It was pretty crowded but thats expected with the block party. We got our drinks at the bar quickly by a brunette bartender who was very nice. We were standing unknowingly by where the bartenders and barbacks enter and exit. My brother was then kicked by a gentleman behind the bar in a leopard costume, and told rudely \"you're still here? still in my fucking way?\" my brother was offended by his actions and the bartender proceeded to shove him in the chest and get security to escort him out. Had the bartender/barback simply told him that he was in the way once we would have moved. I work in the industry and I am more than patient and nice with the rush but this is absolutely unacceptable to talk and/or treat your patrons like this. 
After he was escorted out, my other brother and I followed, security proceeded to shove my other brother on the floor and began to drag him out. (he had nothing to do with the prior incident), I told security to please stop and give him a chance to get up, which they did and I picked him up on my own while they watched. In all of this his phone was dropped. I went back to see if they had picked it up and they had it in their hand. I politely asked for it back saying I could call it to prove it was his and the man replied \"$30\". Questioning if he was really asking me to pay him for our personal property he replied \"He was kicked out, thats our policy\" this is when I decided we  will NEVER step foot in your establishment again. Extorting a persons phone? I told the security guard that I would be calling the cops because that is ILLEGAL. after contacting the authority he gave it back. I don't know how you train your employees or if that is really your \"policy\" but this was my first and LAST time there. The men at this place are on a power trip and need to realize legal action can be taken."}
{"text":"Well I really cant say if I like the place or not because I (for some reason) wasn't allowed in.  So I went to this place on a Saturday after work to attend a friends pre bachelor party festivities.  Now look I understand how most of the bars/clubs in Scottsdale have a \"strict dress code\" so I purposely brought 2 totally different outfits to make sure I wouldn't have a problem getting in (i thought).  So I get in the area of the place, had to pay $10 for valet (plus tip) got in line and made sure to observe the other males dress to determine if I should be able to get in or if i would have to make a trip to the car.  I saw guys ahead of me getting in with flip flops, hats, ripped jeans, tank tops, so I'm thinking \"Damn i might have over dressed\".  I was wearing a short sleeve button up shirt some clean jeans and a pair of clean air force one's.

So I get my turn at the door and was ABSOLUTELY SURE i wouldn't have any issues getting in.  WRONG!!!  I get to the bouncer, he looks me up and down and say he couldn't let me in...HUH?!?!?  I asked why and he stated \"your shoes\" and un hooked the rope thing and said get out the line.  I was shocked because I watched others getting in with similar shoes and even worst and couldn't believe he said that.  So he stopped talking to me and definitely had a problem with me pointing out people inside and out wearing similar things and he had no problem with letting them in.  So i called my friends (who were already inside) let them know i wasn't going to be able to get in and they came out so we could go somewhere else but before we left i asked another bouncer if I could just go and change my shoes so not to ruin the night and i was told \"No! Once your told you cant get in that's it no second chance\".

\"F\" this place!  I'm glad I wasn't let in it only pushed me to a better bar.  Wish i had read the reviews on here earlier that way we would have never went at all!  

By the way \"HI FI\" I work in customer relations for one of the biggest call centers in Scottsdale and I will be sure to tell every not to go there anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent place if you want to wait in line well the door guy lets all of his friends in. And then has the nerve to ask If ill give him a 20 spot to get in. If I owned this place would be pissed. Letting money walk right by."}
{"text":"Refreshing adult milk shakes?!  Sign me up!

My friends and I checked this place out right after it opened.  The lure of ice cream and alcohol on a warm afternoon was too enticing.  In keeping in line with Old Town, this place isn't very big, but there's tons of seating and booths.  The DJ was playing a funky retro mix, and the overall vibe was good.

Service, however, was not good.  It took an hour to get 3 milkshakes and 6 glasses of water, and we had to ask for the water 3 times.  I don't get what's up with people and water in this state...seriously, this is the desert.  People need to hydrate.  I even tip for water....just bring me a glass, don't make me keep asking.  

Needless to say, we decided not to stay.  Although the drinks were good, the service was way too slow.  Next time I think I'll try a weekday...maybe that will be better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Awesome atmosphere and a great place to watch the game. Food is great and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Old Town! I go here every single time I go out and it never fails. It is VERY packed after 10 so be aware that you might want to go here first on your night of bar hopping. The music is always on point and the drinks are always strong. 

I never have a problem getting in, mainly because my boyfriend knows all of the bouncers and the GM. We always walk right in! However, this past weekend that all changed. It was the Saturday of the Phoenix Open (huge golf tournament) and my boyfriends 30th birthday, two HUGE events for us. I can understand that most bar/clubs in Scottsdale try and maintain a guy/girl ratio and with the open in town there were about 15 guys to every 1 girl.... Long story short, we actually got TURNED AWAY because we had 1 too many guys in our group... let me tell you how the door guy was very apologetic explaining this ratio, which I understand but when you let in a group of ugly, over weight, fat chicks (yes, that is shallow but this is Scottsdale) instead of someone who has spent tons of money (and were about to do it again) at your bar is terrible. We went to El Hefe and walked straight in, no issues there.

I will forever look at HiFi differently after that. Used to be a 5 star bar, now a 3..."}
{"text":"Alex our server was the best. The brunch selection and the bottomless bloody Mary's were the bomb."}
{"text":"Stay away. Overpriced, food is mediocre at best, staff is rude. Many better options out there don't waste your time."}
{"text":"My first experience here. My friend had nike shoes on and they didn't let him in. He had nice jeans and a dress shirt on. They let people in with hats and shorts. The bouncers are selective. We were just trying to celebrate my friends bday.  I will never come back. Filing a BBB complaint too."}

{"text":"Douchbag ass bouncer told my buddy he couldn't come in because he had a face tattoo. This dumb idiot was trying to hustle us into giving his broke ass money to get in LMAO hey pal if your not making enough money you should get a different job especially with your xm size shirt."}
{"text":"Well, what can say about this place? I like the place. They play good music. Gets crowded after a while which was good. The more people the better. 
We got there around 10pm no line and free to get in which always a plus. Crowd is pretty good. Drinks are reasonable. Paid $20 for 1 mixed drinks and 2 beers not bad at all. 
We only stayed for an hour coz we wanted to check out other places also. Overall, experience on this was good. I'll def go back to this place."}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff..! I was there this weekend and lets just say I will not be going back.  I witnessed a fight that was not being stopped, security looked like it was more interested in flirting away than helping to break it off. Meanwhile I'm over here wating for my drinks and food and server nowhere to be found. 


Place is pretty ghetto and untasteful, lets just put it that way."}
{"text":"We have come her for Brunch quite often. It's kind of a diamond in the rough. We love coming here for the bottomless mimosas, which are only $15 if you order food and $25 by itself. The food itself, surprisingly, is pretty good. I always enjoy the buffalo chicken sliders with fries or the breakfast burrito.
Our favorite bartender when we come is Marissa. She always takes care of us every time. A few of the other bartenders are nice as well but nothing over the top. 
If you are looking for a fun time and good food without a wait and being over crowded this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal. The nightlife scene is unparalleled. I've had the pleasure to go out with multiple promoters from Hifi; Keaton, Devon, & DJ all great guys and hook it up beyond belief. Give them a call if you're looking for a place to take a big group!"}
{"text":"Had to come to Hi Fi and try one of these \"Adult Milkshakes\" I kept hearing about.  I opted for one with  pineapple and coconut.   I was not blown away, they were pretty good, just not very strong at all.  We ordered some hummus, some wings and a couple other appetizers.  The food was decent, once again nothing that blew me away.  I did really like the look of this place, cool for day drinking and nighttime drinking alike. Best view for people watching.  I would also say that I found it to be more of an early 20's crowd when I was there."}
{"text":"Greeted and served quickly.  Once first drink was served never saw another server. Sat for approximately 45 minutes waiting for another drink before leaving. The DJ positioned a tv so we could watch curling. He was aweswome. The rest of the staff terrible. The place was almost empty. Now we know why. Even when I told them as we were leaving that we had been waiting a long time for a drink both the server and bartender just looked at us and just said \"oh\". No apology or anything.  The worst service we have had during our visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"Want to know what it's like to be involved in human Tetris? Come here right before it switches to the bar life. 

We came at 9 p.m. and were lucky to get in without a line and find a table right away...but within the hour the waitstaff had made us move our table around and rearrange our chairs while we were waiting on our food and they hinted that if we stayed too much longer we'd need to vacate the table as they turn into \"bottle service\" after a certain point. Luckily the waiter was very nice about this, saying that if no one bought the table we could stay there as long as we liked.

We ordered some late night snacks - pretzels and beer cheese and wings. The food was delicious and I had no complaints about the drinks. The music selection was awesome - lots of 90s nostalgia in the early hours before it turns too clubby. This place is more my speed in the early hours, but quickly takes a turn for the douche after 10 p.m."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour- or what we thought was happy hour. The menu said that sliders and pretzels were $3 and $5 respectively. I ordered a beer (312 goose island), they said they were changing tap. Come back later after waiting and said it was out. Fine but when I asked what was comparable, they had no idea. We get food and drinks and then the bill. Not only do we get charged for the beer I never received, but also everything else was full price. The sliders were $3 each, which were the normal menu price and they never asked how many we wanted and it's listed on the happy hour menu as \"sliders.\"  I guess it means slider. We were also charged full price for pretzels and when we complained, they begrudgingly gave us a $3 discount. Happy hour is a joke here. It doesn't exist."}
{"text":"Saturday night my friends and I went to HiFi and as per usually it was super busy and crowded. My boyfriend went to the bar to get a drink and after charging his card and handing him his drink, the bartender informed him that he had lost the card. My boyfriend got frustrated as thats his only card and the all the bartender said was \"I don't know what to tell you\". You are kidding right? Then were just standing outside and as people pass by us, on of the bottle service girls shoves my boyfriend out of the way. He says \"excuse me\" and she starts flipping. Telling him she is going to get him kicked out for \"disrespecting her in her place of work\". The servers are very unprofessional and need a lesson on basic manners before working in a bar where theyre job is to serve people and provide good customer service."}
{"text":"We ordered food 20 minutes after we got here....still no food, on a Tuesday, gwith 20% occupancy!!! Don't get me wrong, they definitely deliver on the \"cocktail\" portion of their name, but not the \"kitchen.\" The servers are attending but are idiots/could give a rats ass! They are as forgetful as they are stupid! Definitely fun if you're hammered and cannot notice but otherwise go home for better service and cheaper drinks!"}
{"text":"Well right off the bat the place looks really cool, low walls at the entrance so it already feels like your in the bar, good music, some awesome artwork, and huge TV's everywhere. The problem I have is when you pay $19 for 2 vodka redbulls, which by the way WTF I could by my own bottle of vodka for that, I wouldn't expect my feet to be stuck to the floor... literally almost lost my shoes 3 times. How is it opening week/weekend and the place seemed just dirty?  That makes no sense. Well regardless of the good stuff, I couldn't justify paying another $20 for 2 more drinks while loosing my shoes so we left after about a half hour. In all honesty the place has great potential but with prices like that your only attracting a certain type of people...  Scottsdale dbags."}
{"text":"Very attractive crowd including the employees!! Amazing customer service compared to the bars in Newport, CA. The asian girl with really long hair was so friendly and attractive and i just wanted to marry her!! It felt like a mini-vegas for us and spring training this year was one in the books.. Thanks HIFI for the experience and memories!"}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday the 18th. I witnessed a group of bachelorette party girls wearing \"bride tribe\" shirts harass and assault a group of two girls and two guys. The bride tribe was clearly over served and attempted to get the innocent patrons kicked out of the bar. The patrons were asked to move to the patio to avoid conflict with the bride tribe. Moments later the tribe was then kicked out of the bar for being over served and rowdy to staff and other innocent patrons. The bride tribe then continue to hop over the fence in the patio and physically assault the two girls. Swinging and running away. There was an off duty police officer with the victims.  He was the only one who attempted to catch the bride tribe. Meanwhile the girls were shaken up and alone. No staff or managers came to their side. The manager drew asked if they would move away from the bar bc they were making a scene. Drew-the manager- was inconsiderate and selfish. Safety is not an option here. Drew needs a different job bc he has no idea how to be a manager let alone respectful to his patrons."}
{"text":"Hi FI opened up close to a year ago, but it has taken a lot less time then that to become one of my favorite palaces to go to. The food is amazing, and the \"adult milkshakes\" cant be beat. At night it transforms into a top notch club that cant be beat. I suggest to anyone to check it out if you're looking for a good meal or a good time."}
{"text":"Food better than average, service was good, music is good and ambiance is pretty cool. Would come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever. It took us ten min and me asking someone to get service. Another 20 min to get beers and the wait staff is rude. This place is also filthy!! I suggest health inspectors come see this place ASAP. The ladies restroom was so gross. Toilet paper all over the place, a sink clogged and over flowing with rancid stagnant water and there was feces on the wall of a stall. I can't imagine what their kitchen looks like. 

The food isn't bad but not amazing. The pretzels were impressive. Wish the service was as half decent as the pretzel. 

Night life here is again interesting.... You wait in an line at the bar for about ten minuets when u finally reach the bar you're getting hit on by sweaty man who's wearing way too much cologne. The drinks are nothing special and the service all around is again less than stellar. 

Not impressive.

Review update!!! I went back against my will but I must say that Molly the server is awesome. By far the best service I have EVER received at HiFi. Note to the owners and managers keep this girl around. She is on top of her game and actually seems to care about the company. She wasn't our server at first and was still super attentive!! (She ended up being our server in the end.) Congrats Molly on being an amazing server and changing my negative attitude towards this establishment. Keep up the great work Molly!!"}
{"text":"****Order the hummus or die****
This place is super cool. I was visiting on business and wanted to have a happy hour (or pleural hours) before I headed home. If you live here you know there are a ton of places to go downtown so a new spot may not be a success. Well HiFi is awesome. First of all the staff is super nice and helpful. Our bartender and waitress were awesome! We ordered 2 sliders, one buffalo chicken and the other veggie meatball and hummus. OMG the hummus is so good and fresh. The pine nuts on top are amazing and the pita chips are perfect!! I thought the meatball was going to  be meatless but it was hamburger. Even though I didn't eat it the hummus was more than enough. I ordered a boring vodka tonic and the bartender made it just how I like it. I come to visit AZ for work frequently and I will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Still the same crappy, zero service! CA  someone say train wreck? Maybe it's time to retool fellas."}
{"text":"Super crowded due to a stellar location. 

The people that owns this place knows what they are doing. Playing the game by investing where investing is due. This way they fill the place, and have a decent ratio between men and women (even if it seems always be a surplus of guys in Scottsdale arena), and can suck when it comes to service. Nobody cares, and nobody comes here for the service. 

People come to this place to hook up, and I applaud them for it. I have no talent nor interest for this kind of behavior, but then again I am old and grumpy - not a young hothead that wants to get my groove on to validate myself. This being said, I shouldn't be here.. and I doubt that I will. But just because I don't fit in here doesn't mean that people shouldn't go here.. even though it is my belief that if you are going out in Scottsdale, this is not your best bet.

The bar is high in old Scottsdale, and Hi Fi - I don't think you got it."}
{"text":"Great Pittsburgh Steeler's bar. The Roethlis-burger was very good, 2 patties, awesome sweet pickles and terrific sauce. The place to go for a large beer selection, game day food ( upscale bar type food). They also serve brunch."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Hi Fi. I met a friend there for midweek Happy Hour which, by the way, runs until 7pm. The service was excellent! Our server was friendly and attentive, the manager stopped by to check on us and the bartender was very generous with their pours. After my great experience, I was surprised to read the poor reviews here on Yelp. Perhaps we just got the best server in the restaurant. I'll definitely be going back soon for another Adult Milk Shake!"}
{"text":"Don't go here to watch football. 

We had a great time watching the Cardinals game here until the Cards started losing and they decided to blast shitty, old music over playing the sound of the game. 

We asked to speak to a manager and they never showed up. 

We were told the DJ was in charge of playing music over playing the volume on the football games. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"Called to ask a simple question if anybody had turned in my wallet and some worker named Gage was super rude about the situation. Told me he has been getting calls all day as if I was suppose to know that ???? Sorry I was calling to make sure mine had not been turned in !!! My bad for the god awful question !!!!! No one call them if you lose something !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure Hi Fi has a cool night scene but I went here to eat, so let me preface this review with that. It's a big open bar with lots of outdoor seating. All the waitresses are in skimpy outfits and, even on a Monday at 4:30pm, everyone there was drunk.

I got the Mac and cheese, which, with every bite, would congeal into a weird gelatinous shape. It was like I was eating white velveeta that wasn't quite as good as velveeta. If I hadn't had a few Stella's before it, I might not have eaten it.

The place was empty, especially compared to the place across the street, which just further showed how this is not a place to get food. Go here late night if you choose but there's so many places in Scottsdale that it's hard to justify Hi Fi."}
{"text":"This bar was probably the single reason why I will never return to North Scottsdale. Security is passively racist and questioned me and a colleague on shoes. 

\"You can't come in here with Air Force Ones or Air Macs\"

You can't be serious. I had on neither type of shoe, and just wanted a few drinks so I can go home.  


Who cares about shoes?? I'm here for. Decent time, shoe are replaceable, memories are not idiot.  You have no posted policy anywhere, thus have no legal precedent to deny entry. You're asking for a lawsuit regardless."}
{"text":"Upon walking into hifi I was utterly confused. For one, not a single person said anything about seating ourselves. The bar was filled with scantly dressed waitresses who were aloof to what was going on; half of them didn't know what time brunch ended and the other half didn't really know anything about what was on the menu. When we found a booth we asked for brunch menus, however it took three different employees until we actually got a brunch menu and not a regular menu. 
Up until that point I thought I was doomed. It wasn't until we sat and ordered and finally got our food that out experience took a 360 turn for the better.  We ended up with a large, comfy leather booth. The food was delicious, I got the French toast and my friend got a breakfast burrito. We also got alcoholic shakes which were very sweet but good. The DJ started plying music during tv commercials and absolutely killed it. 

Overall the experience turned out real good. But due to the poor service, ditsy waitresses and seemingly clueless staff, I give them 3 stars (I would give 3.5 if I could). But pretty delicious food and great DJ for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The service is fantastic...the waitresses are gorgeous, friendly, and fast.  We gave our phone number to the hostess, and within 15 minutes had a round of drinks and a table on the patio that was perfect for people watching.  The burgers were amazing, as were the drinks.  I feel sorry for El Hefe.  Hi Fi is right across the street, and that's not good for El Hefe's business."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I'm getting way to old for places like this. Met some friends in Scottsdale and ended up getting some drinks here. It is a HIGH ENERGY packed place. It seems to be the launching pad for many of the bar crowd that occupy this place between 8-11pm. It is open late but it seems to slow late night as folks migrate to the other surrounding clubs. I will say that this place is a technological marvel. It is simply amazing what bars/clubs pull together to differentiate themselves these days."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times. Good food, but service could definitely be quicker. Also I have had multiple problems when it comes to credit card charges. They overcharged me last night and a few weeks ago gave the wrong card back to my girlfriend."}
{"text":"We usually come here around happy hour! I've been here a couple times at night when it is a club- it's good. I would recommend getting a patio booth- the breeze is key when it's crowded inside! My husband loves the chicken sandwich which is why we go there around happy hour- catch a game, it's great! 
FYI I think they changed their hours to now open at 5?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Honestly were there for 2 hours and never got a waitress. Rude bartenders. The place has nothing going for it other than location. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the many other good establishments a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"I love to come here for a fun night out with my friends. I did not expect much out of AZ, but I was pleasantly surprised. The music is trendy and they have a diverse crowd. The bouncers and bartenders are awesome. This place also has good food and the manager is on top of it. After a night of partying, I decided to come here to try the food. I was a little irritated by the service, but the manager came right over and took care of it. I didn't even know he noticed. Food was also amazing. Okay enough of this. Time to eat my food."}
{"text":"Lots of tv's.  Good open bar you can see across. Try the sliders, they are pretty good."}
{"text":"Lousy service!
Over priced food and drink!
Verging on racism when it come to whom they allow into the establishment.  Other than that it is mediocre.
Avoid!"}
{"text":"Hifi was unlike anything we have in Toronto! First, the bouncer  at the front door was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, he has to be some kind of fitness model bearded captain America. He was extremely welcoming and polite and let me and my girlfriends skip the line! Which was great since it was my girls bachelorette party! Brownie point for you hifi for hiring such a gentleman. Inside was insane! It was a little too packed shoulder to shoulder, and a battle to even get to the bar! Moving around anywhere is a nightmare, and there was a bit to much hip hop. But other than that, it was great! Our drinks were great, the lightning and patio were awesome, and they shot of sparklers which was unique. It was a good choice for the bachelorette party! However we ended up at a bar across the street called blonde and had a even better time there! Such a nicely dressed crowed! Amazing music, and less crowded! Either way if you are in Scottsdale for sure go party at hifi with the sexy security, and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. I was there with friends on a Saturday night and was treated so rudely and was so disrespected that I will never go back there again.  The music was good, as was the people watching.  However, the bartenders and other staff were flat-out rude, which I tolerated until they literally sold our table out from under us and made us get up without even allowing us to finish our drinks.  It wasn't just bad customer service, it was downright mind-blowing rudenesa....they must look for complete jerks during hiring."}
{"text":"More good food. The pretzel bun on the $11 Pastrami Rueben was top notch. Pretty good version of pastrami also, loaded with slaw and swiss cheese. They served \"fancy\" sauce on the side, which I still don't know what it was, but it seemed mostly like Thousand Island dressing. Southwestern style crinkle cut fries were loaded with seasoning and it was a pretty satisfying lunch. Female bartenders are always nice and always attractive, even right at 10AM for kickoff."}
{"text":"This place gets way too packed, has a fight or 2 break out every night I'm there, some of the employees are extremely rude and feel they are entitled to shove their way through the guests, rudely take chairs out from under you when preparing for the midnight madness (could have asked nicely to take my chair from under my ass), and also, when a lady is at the bar, you take her order first, not help 6 males first even though you see her waiting. Not good customer service at this place. Least favorite bar in old town. Music is way too loud to the point where your ears ring after leaving and that is not necessary. That level of the music is not enjoyable. The worst part about this place is how many people they let in. You can't even walk around so pick your spot and make sure you don't have to pee because you can't even get to the bathroom. Glad to not attend anymore nights here, only reason I did was to celebrate my friends bday."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that I have had fun here in the past, but I will never go back.

I have had my cell phone stolen out of my purse here TWICE. When I called the next day when it opened and I said that to the person that picked up he said \"that doesn't surprise me\""}
{"text":"Came to Hi Fi for drinks around 11pm. The whole street was packed but Hi Fi was jamming. The place is pretty big but it gets packed fast. Seems pretty casual if guys are able to get in with T-shirt's and tennis shoes. There was a good mix between guys and girls and different age groups. Hilarious how the cocktail waitress is escorted in a power wheel convertible while bringing your bottle to the table. It's totally a sight to be seen."}
{"text":"Was here on a Thursday night and somehow it was completely packed. Don't know how that works since most other places aren't. Anyways it has a lot of energy - so many conversations, endless interaction, drinking, loud music and apparently you're allowed to dance on top of the sofas, my friend did and was offered a job immediately afterwards. Also, ladies there's tons of men here for whatever reason - and men - there's not enough women here, so go to Maya instead which is literally 10 steps West, tons of gorgeous ladies there. The drinks were good and priced fairly. The tables were really comfortable and they provided indoor as well as outdoor seating - however there isn't a dance floor (now you can see why my friend resorted to dancing on top of the couches). Major flaw. It's basically a gigantic bar/lounge."}
{"text":"i love hi fi! great food and awesome milkshakes! make sure to try the cinnamon roll one, its made with fireball! Place is decorated super cool and has an awesome vibe!"}
{"text":"I come in here all of the time to watch football, for happy hour, and the delicious food. The atmosphere is always a great time, and the food choices are not just limited typical bar food. Don't get me wrong they do have your usual bar food, but they also have a great salad selection & this is the first place I've been to that has alcohol milkshakes. You cannot go wrong with the birthday cake shake. Trust me."}
{"text":"Always have to come back to this place!!! Great music and fun crowds."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The help is rude.  I have been here three times and walked out the last time after the bartender stood around and talked to his buddies instead of serving my date and I.  I know it is new, maybe it will get better."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I will not be going back.  I've been there a few times with friends and it has been fun but very crowded if you don't have a table.  Needless to say the night I end up going back and actually getting bottle service was a mess.  We called in advance and requested a table on the dance floor, and when we got there they tried to put us in an awkward corner area and insisted it was the dance floor (which I know it wasn't).  We were also greeted by their trashy VIP host.  She was very rude and extremely unfriendly.  We told her that the table she was giving us was not what we had requested and she made us wait 20 minutes for a new table.  She had also originally told us on the phone that it was a two bottle minimum which would run about $600, which we were ok with. Once we got there and told her the table was all wrong, she gave us a table on the dance floor like we had originally requested.  This change, which was all her fault for misleading us, ended up costing us $1200.  I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"This place Rocks! The design concept is out of this world.  Between the art above the main bar and the eternal wall of bad ass video images combined with a super hot looking staff that actually cares, I can't wait to go back and kick it! HiFi is it."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Bartenders are awesome and i tip them really great (50% everytime) for always hustling and slangin' drinks quickly when super packed. The bouncers see me as a regular and don't have to wait anymore and the girls are beautiful. Haven't tried any of their food yet so will get back on that one when I do. 

It f does get packed on the weekends and hard to move through the crowd. Best bet is to get there a little early and snag a couch... it's fun as well. 

Ethen"}
{"text":"I'm never spending another dime here. Having been to HiFi a few times before I can't say I was ever impressed with the service. But hey, it's a crowded bar so what can you expect. Decided to give HiFi another shot and get bottle service with a few friends. While most of the staff is okay, all it really takes is one to ruin your experience. The demeanor of our server was horrible and made us feel as if we were imposing anytime we asked for something - terrible attitude. Seems like the staff there has the mentality that they're doing you some huge favor by simply doing their job. Just about any other place in old town is better. I'm not going spend my money or my time at a place that treats its customers as an after thought."}
{"text":"Ok, so they didn't take my CC, like I said in The last review. Also, I am not accusing this place of any wrongdoing.  This place just sucks."}
{"text":"This place has potential if they stop price gouging tourists. I'm a local and experienced surge pricing on big weekends it's B.S."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They don't listen to what you order and take away your food before you're done eating. The management is so rude even when you offer to pay for your correct order. The barback Jason is the only decent employee here."}
{"text":"First time at Hi Fi. Came for early dinner with friends. There were about 30 folks in the place at 4:30, probably due to its awesome location. 

Let's get to the food. I ordered Papago Orange Blossom beer, my favorite beer in the world. Good start. My wife got a glass of wine, which she nursed for a couple of hours. She also ordered the quinoa salad and some fries. I ordered the bacon Brussels sprouts and buffalo wings. 

The salad was very good. It had a good, tangy dressing, plenty of nicely cut veggies and a healthy portion. The fries with spicy aioli were very good too but the order was pretty tiny. My sprouts were very disappointing. They weren't caramelized at all, so they were rather greasy. The wings, which came with very good bleu cheese dip, were lackluster. So my wife ordered good stuff and I did not. Crap. 

The meal without drink was $25 plus tip. Not bad but the flavors were subpar."}
{"text":"I really dig this place. Love the laid-back atmosphere, not the typical shiny, glittery \"notice me notice me\" Scottsdale crowd. Loved the music playing in the background, food was delish, drinks good, the stereo wall is way cool and the manager was funny and personable. Note: when we arrived, we just walked in to grab some food. We had no idea it took on a club-type atmosphere until we were leaving and saw the ropes and bouncer. LOL. My review is not based on a \"club\" experience."}
{"text":"Bar hoped for my bday and this was one of the stops and a rude bar tender killed the good vibe. My friend ordered us two vodka tonics and my card wasn't going through. So my friend told me \"hey she needs your ID\" I handed the bar tender my ID and she threw it back at me and said \"what am I going to do with this?, I need money! Not getting your card back till the drinks are paid for!\" So I tried calling the bank to activate the card again but I needed the numbers on the card, but my card was held hostage by the mean bar tender. So my friend jumps to the rescue and pays the tab to get my card back and she charged him 30 dollars! Like I know darn well two vodka tonics do not cost 30 dollars I guess she decided she was going to help herself to a tip....... Happy bday to me; right? Anyways this place has never failed but last night it did more than that."}
{"text":"Love hifi. The staff is awesome, the music is super loud and is my favorite spot to watch all the games. They have about 15 tv's so you won't miss anything. Food there is also really good."}
{"text":"Straight up burger was really good and flavorful. The fries that are seasoned I think Cajun style are good too.
It is the summer and 110 out but having a av unit pummeling me with air while eating was kind of uncomfortable after a little bit.
The first waitress must have been new, because she was slow with everything. 
The second waitress seemed like she knew her stuff and should be some sort of management position or lead.

Overall, this place has good food, good music, and at night, it's fun"}
{"text":"Never again will I go to hi-fi.. The bartender mixed our Wine with tequila obviously if we wanted tequila we would have ordered that & he refused to make a drink we actually wanted after we realized he put tequila in the wine. We were told he doesn't want to make a crappy drink like Sprite/vodka...smh  Uncomfortable place to go to & obviously not a safe environment if your bartender is out there spiking drinks ..bad bad bad vibes.. If you do go make sure you watch them make ur drink!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place in old town open day and night!
Daytime - great drink specials, music, and service
Night - perfect venue for a birthday, always the DJ never disappoints"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. Horrible Managment and in the end profiles our group and didn't let us in due to one of our friend being dressed to urban. Then turned away another group of NON-whites. While we see everyone walking in with anything they want one. This place is a joke. Don't waste your time with this BS"}
{"text":"Really cool see and be seen place in Old Town Scottsdale.  We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a drink and totally enjoyed the people watching.  The bartenders had tons of personality and made the experience great...loved that they were dressed up too!"}
{"text":"I get that his place is live on Saturday nights and I get why there's always a line.. but in realitiy.. this ain't Vegas.  Most popular clubs in Seattle.. lines tend to move quick.  The richer areas like Bellevue, the same.. lines tend to move quick.  Scottsdale is comparable to Bellevue (Rich folks.. fancy cars.. etc.). 

From what I saw the past few weekends (Saturday Nights), the only issue I have is the line.  Go there Saturday night.  Security personal checking your I.D. is that short white dude who thinks he's bad ass.  \"Hey girls.. I'll let you in.. but give me a hug.\" SMH. 

One of the worst experiences.. There goes half the night. 

This place could be awesome if it was bigger and better Security Personal who can check ID's faster.  Maybe Management told Security to check 1 ID every 5 to 10 minutes but that just means.. Management sucks even more. 

People came to drink and have fun.. not wait in line for an hour just to get to the front of the line and wait another 15 minutes.  Sure I can give the short security guy some money.. but what's the point of free entry.  dafuq? 

Hi Fi also needs to do a better job of managing the damn line.  People cut which may cause a fight to break out or some to jump over the fence onto the patio.  

I give this place a 1 for wasting my time and wasting my time writing this damn review.  

People,
Try going to Whisky Row.. it's right next door.  Faster.. better looking girls and less crowded.  It's not a bumper to bumper grind on guys ass. Oh!! and the girls dancing on the bar holding a 5th of goose.. they pour you drinks.. but make sure to tip those gals.  the bartenders are way hotter at Whisky Row"}
{"text":"I am newly 21 and decided to celebrate my 21st birthday here about a month ago. Last night, I went back to HIFI with a friend from home who was visiting, and they questioned my ID. Asked for me to pull up my social media with my birthday and I rightfully did. He then asked for something else with my birthday, like car insurance. CAR INSURANCE. When does someone go to a club with car insurance? Beats me! Told me they didn't have an ID scanner so I would have to call the police to be able to get my ID back and to be let in. 30 minutes later a cop shows up to look at my ID ask me a few questions. Finally tells the bouncer it's me, it's real and then the bouncer tells us we won't be let in because of our attitudes. There was no attitude just a little miffed because I had to waste 45 minutes of my time. Eventually let us in, but will never be returning. Train your bouncers to know how to ID someone, or hmm I don't know, buy an ID scanner?"}
{"text":"Great vibe, Deconstructed meatballs and market kale salad are great. Beautiful people  serving you with a DJ spinning.  What coukd be better? In the heart of Scottdales bar scene."}
{"text":"Hifi is fun for Sunday funday debauchery but their customer service is awful. I lost my phone one day while I was there and the whole situation was a complete nightmare. I called and asked in-person on at least three separate occasions if anyone turned in my phone. The answer was no so I bought a new phone. About a month later I was informed that my phone was in fact there. They told me to come pick it up or it would be donated. Even then, it was like pulling teeth to get it because when I tried to pick it up, I was told again that they didn't have it. This was after they called me.. Somehow it made its way across the street to bottled blonde. Through this entire process, not one person was apologetic or even seemed to care. Thanks Hifi."}
{"text":"Place had tents setup just in case it started to rain, the staff was friendly,  and they had a tight dj last night. Drinks are reasonable priced and they have a good heating system in the patio. 

Would come out again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Loved the place, terrible service. Sat at our table of six for 30 minutes before our server came, drinks took another 20. She messed a few orders up as well. And only saw her every 45 minutes or so. Food was decent. Great place to watch a game though and the indoor outdoor environment is awesome. We'll be back but hopefully with a different waitress!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 2 stars when I first walked in. The service wasn't good and I didn't see the appeal. Then I grabbed my hummus and it was delicious! And then I tasted heaven. I wasn't even in the mood for a milkshake but the adult birthday cake milkshake was amazing!!! I'm here on a Wednesday so I didn't experience the crowd.  

I highly recommend the milkshakes. Don't walk out without one!!!"}
{"text":"Family friendly atmosphere during the day, with many great Happy Hour specials on food and drink. Ask about their specialty Milkshakes! Best spot in Old Town to throw a birthday party, and if you reserve a table through one of the girls, the first bottle is complimentary! 

The music and DJ at this venue is consistently on point, and service is fast during the weekend, even during busy times."}
{"text":"I liked this place.
Fun vibe, didn't feel overly crowded for a Saturday night, and most importantly for me... it didn't feel pretentious!"}
{"text":"Honestly despite all the reviews saying the service sucks....the service is quite great! Our waitress is on top of it especially on a Saturday afternoon the same weekend Maya opened next door. It's such a shit show here but our waitress has checked up on us every 10 minutes it's great"}
{"text":"When you go to old town this is the first place you should be going whether you are going for their great happy hour or a night out. Their happy hour is unbeatable with half off salads and appetizers and at night they always have the best music playing. If you are planning a night out, I definitely recommend going to hi fi."}
{"text":"We got a table there on a Saturday night 
On the phone we told them we are about 15 ppl so we need a big place. They told us we will need to buy a place for 2 groups ( 4 bottles ) and we agreed. 
When we got there we got a big place, but after 30 mins they took our table and split it with more ppl . Try to sell on top of our back . 
We found ourself 15 guys standing like sardines 
They bottles when we got them also were open ( make me wonder if they mixed with water ) 
We left 45 after we got there and went somewhere else"}
{"text":"Would not recommend!  Spent 2 hours at an outdoor table, and never once had a waitress stop by our table.  Had to go to the bar to get our own drinks.  After 2 hours of sitting at this table, a rude manager came and told us we had to leave the table as it \"was sold\" for bottle service.  We were never even told that the tables were being sold for bottle service, and never given the chance to keep the table if we purchased bottle service.  We were just rudely told to leave our table and were not even allowed to finish our drinks.  There are plenty of other places just steps away from this place that are eager for your business and treat you with respect.!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time about 6-7 months ago. It on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. I loved the \"vibe.\" The seating is great with coaches located throughout. I regret driving there without a \"designated driver\" as I read could had more fun."}
{"text":"First time at this place and they were absolutely slammed but still handled themselves with the best customer service. I was very impressed with they way they handled themselves. Great food and drinks too!"}
{"text":"Best spot in Scottsdale to have a good time. The food is delicious and their adult milkshakes are amazing! The staff is always welcoming. Definitely my favorite bar!!"}
{"text":"The manager Michael attacked me as I was recording an incident outside their night club sat night early Sunday morning. Broke my iPhone. Tells you what kind of worthless employees they must have if the manager loses control. If you want to get in a fight, this is the place to go. Multiple fights throughout the night.  I even emailed the general manager to resolve the issue and of course no response. I will be pressing charges as I have on video the manager attacking me.  Losers!!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. The management is non existent (obviously, or they'd be concerned about what a crappy place it is). I lost my wallet and called 8 times in the span of a week. No one answered but the voicemail promised to call back if I left a message. The drinks are super over priced. And don't get me started on the staff at the door. So rude and condescending. It's like they think they run the nicest club in Vegas or something. Hi-Fi: you're a joke."}
{"text":"These guys don't support UofA teams so I wont support them in Tucson."}
{"text":"They are good for drinks, but other than that they don't care about you, even bottle service and talking to a manager they overcharge, after they over charge you they add to the price of every drink you order and want a tip, if you ask for the management to correct the BS you get a free shot that in no way makes up for the neglect you get when you get bottle service. Don't go here for a party and after I bought bottle service, the BUS BOY spilt beer in my girlfriend and I, overall a horrible night."}
{"text":"HiFi is by far my favorite bar/club in Scottsdale. A great happy hour and bottomless mimosas on the weekend ! Doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"First off; no jerseys on a Sunday? It's Sunday football. Went here after the Steelers game and they didn't let us in..Been going for years and all of a sudden the games are over and no jerseys?? The place is run by a bunch of tight New York assholes. They were probably bullied in highs school and don't let anyone in they don't like. The staff is like a merry go round because they can't stand the management. Place is staying afloat only because of investors and the owner. If you like mediocre food, overpriced drinks and assholes from front to back this place is perfect for you. Fuck Hi-Fi."}
{"text":"If u have money this place is perfect for you!  After four hours and a $300 tab my party of 8 people got booted from our table for someone who was willing to pay $600 and bought a bottle!  We could have easily spent that much on beer but because we didn't buy a bottle we weren't worthy. On top of that I was willing to pay the $100 reservation fee so we wouldn't lose our seats and I was told I didn't have to worry about it, that we were fine!  Then the kicker we hadn't even vacated our table yet and they were already clearing our stuff out and putting the other party in place! All I can say is BS. Wish I hadn't wasted my hard earned money there."}
{"text":"Well...

Seriously...

Okay...

Do you ever wonder why people are always walking around in the club? As in the entire time you're there someone is always walking by you? Is it all at one time the entire time that people are doing their people watch laps?

Let's be real. I'm in Scottsdale. Everyone walking around looks a Kardashian. I just want to stand around and stare. But I can't. Someone is always bumping into me. All this is no longer an issue when you know someone. We ended up meeting with a group of folks who had a VIP section. So instead of being in the walkway where everyone was moving around, we're hanging out, sitting around, observing the action, with bottle service, with someone smoking hot pouring drinks for everyone.

Sadly, I wasn't able to drink but I was able to enjoy the scenery.

Girls were dancing on the bar. They dressed rather scandalous. No complaints. Lots of drunk people in the club. Drinks being spilled. People falling all over the place. Loud music and good tracks from the DJ. Say what you want about Miley Cyrus. The place went lit when her Party in the USA hit came on.

I was never into the club scene but a night like this every once in a while is good for the soul. Even better, is at a place like this."}
{"text":"I loved the food but wanted to walk right out with how rude our server was. Her name was holly and every time we asked her for something she had an attitude as if we were inconveniencing her and it just made the experience horrible. I feel she has no place in the restaurant/customer service industry."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, on 3 separate occasions and while it is a great deal for $15 bottomless mimosas, I think I will be going somewhere else next time. Every single server has been crappy or rude.  I've worked as a server and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but some comments are uncalled for. Maybe I will check it out at night or sit at the bar during the day but never again want a server."}
{"text":"Not sure when they added a dress code, but I don't recall it being around when it first opened. It was news to me this weekend. Saturday night my jeans were called \"too baggy\" even though other guys inside the bar were wearing the same kind of jeans. Great eyes, bouncer.

Then today I came in during the day and was turned around because they didn't consider my \"flip flops\" as \"sandals\" yet there again, guys standing in the outside patio were wearing similar open-toed sandals. 

This place is usually really cool spot for drinks and music but the dress code gives bouncers justification to make up stupid reasons up to turn you around. I understand dress standards but when you get down to criticizing what sandals & jeans look like you've hit a low."}
{"text":"This place is trashy, but the music is good. People literally do drugs in public here."}
{"text":"This place had such a cool vibe and some awesome sounding adult milkshakes ! They also have a drink called the fishbowl with is a giant fishbowl full of alcohol! I only fished about half of it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with some girlfriends over the weekend:
Pro- they have a girls only line, so it was nice to get in quickly
Con- it was soooooo overcrowded you couldn't move, dance or barely get a drink at the bar!!! 

I'm not to complain about Scottsdale douchebaggery, as its  just a part of going to any of the newer, trendy places. But wow, doormen and management need to do something about letting so many people in! It's not an enjoyable experience to be drowning in an abyss of sweaty people during our wonderful summer heat. Let's not forget to mention that the design of the open aired venue makes it more heated. All the while drinks are getting spilled all over you while other patrons are trying to make it through the crowd and getting burned by someone's cigarette :-/

Other than the capacity issue, the music was a good mix of top 40, hip hop and EDM, so something to tickle most people's ear holes. The decor and screens on the wall are pretty cool as well."}
{"text":"Awesome bar with amazing staff. Dan and Drew young always go out of their way with service at this bar. Keep doing what you're doing. If you want to have an awesome time in old town Scottsdale, this is the spot to be. The food is also pretty damn good. It's an awesome location to watch live events and for drinks on any day. Usually a must stop each time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here for my B-day and got a VIP at 10:30 to 1:30.  Spent over 900 on for 4 bottles, tipped 180 for 3 hours of work.  The waitress was disappointed and tried teaching me math that they discounted 300 and the tip should be at least 20 more or 200.  I asked if its a fair tip, she walked away and got the manager.  Manager came over and tried to get 20 more from me.  I asked him I was being fair or cheap?  He offered me a bottle of champagne or something for 20 more, I refused to spend a penny more, total bill over 1100 including tip.  Lauren Holly came over and gave me a copy of the bill and apologized.  Started walking towards the taxi when I realized that they didn't give me back my card and ID.  Walked back, got it.  This place was about to get a one star review, but thanks to Lauren Holly apologizing, she saved grace.  I don't think I'll be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"The burger was great, a generous portion of fries came with it, and the fry dip was delish. The place has a cool setup and the staff seem friendly, though I would recommend going during their happy hour, as the regular prices are a little steep for what you get. Our order was rung up incorrectly and although the price was adjusted, it wasn't done so correctly and we still paid slightly more than we should have. However, I will be returning...during their happy hour, of course."}
{"text":"Don't come here. They literally just told me they increased their cocktail prices because of the Phoenix Open weekend. Why would you do this? Huge asshole move. Not paying $14 for a jack n coke. Hard pass"}
{"text":"Great corner location and patio.  Nice cold beer but average food.  The short rib sliders and pretzel appetizers were just so-so."}
{"text":"Two words: alcoholic milkshake!!! So good. Pair it with their chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and it's a winner. The weekends are really busy and crazy. Great for birthday, bachelor, and bachelorette parties!!"}
{"text":"My crowd spent a fortune there. Then one of the male staff members bumped into me very hard recklessly rushing through the crowd. It knocked off my sunglasses but I was going to let it slide and not even say anything. He then turned around and yelled at me even though I was just standing there when he ran me over and I hadn't said a negative word to him. He took my sunglasses and told a bouncer to kick me out. I didn't mind leaving bc the atmosphere is also terrible but he disappeared with my glasses even after I got back in to get them 

So in summary, the staff without any provocation was very physically rough, stole my glasses, was verbally abusive, and threw me out"}
{"text":"Love the drinks at Hi Fi!  Consistently great and nicely priced for the area.  Not usually a very long line on weekends or long wait for a bartender to get to you.  Music is pretty good too!   Nice mix of EDM and hip hop music. :)"}
{"text":"Oh god. Please don't waste your time or money here. There's no room to walk around let alone anything close to a dance floor, the service is complete crap, and their glasses are always dirty! We went again last night to give it another shot, I ordered a round of shots and the bartender wouldn't even make eye contact with me let alone smile or give good customer service at all, then I watched him pour 5 completely uneven shots - only one was a full count and no joke the other 4 were like splashes of liquor, he wasn't paying attention at all. Maybe it was because there was a dancer's bare ass right in his face dancing on top of the bar - so tacky. Then once I finally wriggled my way through the crowd to find my group again, all our shot glasses had lipstick marks all over them. Gross. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my girlfriends and had a really fun time.  The doorman let us in without having to wait in line, which was awesome seeing as this is the newest bar to open up in Scottsdale and it was packed.  The patio was the best part of the place in my opinion; inside you'll find all the douchey people dancing on tables and pretending they're important:)  The dj didn't suck and the prices weren't outrageous.  I'm not big on Scottsdale, but I'd probably recommend coming here with a group to have a good time."}
{"text":"Omg. When the \"grinch\". Also known as the DJ tells you he doesn't have any Linkin Park because we are In Scottsdale, AZ ... run for your life.  This place is awful...  tans it  is empty, play what I want because I am the only paying customer... I'm not 12 and I am not using my babysitting money to hang out here... gross..  Scottsdale??? Really?  Who cares???"}
{"text":"Cant smoke cigars on patio but can smoke cigarettes.  Makes loads of sense.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"The reason: daughters 21st birthday

The Goal: Bar hop and PARTY!! 

1st Stop: HI FI Kitchen & Cocktails

For 10pm on a Sunday night this place was crowded, went up to the bar and ordered the 1st round. Then we were dancing in our spot and drinking our drinks.  After a quick look around I was put at ease when I noticed that I was not the oldest person in the house!!  HHHHEEEEYYY!!! 

This was a fun little spot, packed and you can even get a grope or 3 from a drunken young stud, but over all this was a great starter bar for the bar hopin night!  But I'm confused on the kitchen part, never saw a menu, let alone anyone sitting at tables to grab some food.

Drinks were strong, place was fun, but it's time to bounce, its call Bar Hoping not Bar sitting haha"}
{"text":"I don't step out to the entertainment district too much but when I do I ALWAYS make it to HIFI. If I am entertaining business associates or out for a special occasion I can always count on the staff at HIFI taking care of us. The doorman give you a firm handshake the bartenders do a great job even though the place is always bumping and they are beyond busy. The food is fantastic and the adult milkshakes should be criminal they are so good. As a business owner I judge other companies pretty hard and I have never been let down here. I scrolled some of the reviews and I am a firm believer that you get the energy back that you put out. This is a nightclub environment and I can tell you from witnessing and from hearing the stories the staff has to put up with a ton of knuckleheads. If I was wagering I bet any bad review you read is from a knucklehead that was acting a fool. Go for yourself and prepare to see some of the prettiest people in town, be treated well and hear some great high energy music."}
{"text":"great spot for food and fun. Enjoyed the grilled cheese and fries and to top it off with beer was a great addition.  Even though it was cool out the inside of the restaurant was warm and cozy. Loved the spot want to hit it again very soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great happy hour or just an awesome environment for a fun night on the town, Hi Fi is the place to be! They have a great food selection and you can't beat half off appetizers for happy hour! The staff is always friendly and make it a great experience! See for yourself!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona last week for Spring Training, and Old Town is no joke.  Every place was wall to wall packed.  My experience in Hi Fi was exactly one for the books.  The bartender recommended I try an adult milkshake since I have never been here, she went on explaining what an adult milkshake is and gave me a list of all the different flavors.  I ended up getting the Birthday Cake milkshake, I loved it so much I went back there a second time to get it once more before my vacation ended."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is excellent I recommend the turkey burger it's the best in town. Also the staff are courteous and the night life is so much fun!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Been here a couple of times and always fun. Service is hit more miss. Had amazing great service and no tip on the tab service. Good for a night of fun, without the \"club\" feel!"}
{"text":"Just had some ahi tuna sliders. Super bomb. Alexa was my bartender and was very friendly. Great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I came to HiFi this past Sunday for brunch with a couple of my friends. Not only were they offering a brunch menu with a variety of items to choose from, they also had Mimosa Towers! Unlike anything I've seen before! No other venue that I have went to in this area was offering mimosa towers. They were reasonably priced and served between 15-20 servings. Amazing amount of champagne in the tower as well! My food came out quick and I ordered the eggs benedict (try tenderloin instead of the traditional). Staff was super friendly and the venue was big. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"this place is tight, hands down the best venue Oldtown Scottsdale's entertainment district has to offer. great music, great food, beautiful people, and an overall stellar atmosphere. the staff is very polite and persistent in their efforts to make sure your Hi Fi experience is absolutely incredible. if you're ever around town for lunch, i would suggest you try the Buffalo Chicken Sliders with one of their world renowned cocktails. and if you're ever hitting the town with some friends during the weekend, there's just no other club that will be packed wall to wall with aesthetically pleasing people like this place."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this establishment again. This pitiful establishment kicked out a group of people (who happened to be gay) because other customers were uncomfortable. The fact that this was even able to happen tells us the kind of GARBAGE management they have. I will continue to spread the word."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to be in Old town....... this club could use a new DJ for sure and it's pretty ghetto there. I would expect more considering the surrounding night clubs are more upscale. It's a nice place but needs work."}
{"text":"Tonight was Grand Opening night.  We were lucky enough to get an invite.  This place rocks.  The footprint of the place is relatively small, but there are large booths (6-10 pp), plenty of space around the bar and patio.  

The decor is super cool with one wall full of old-school retro speakers.

Another wall is where the DJ booth is located and a projector showing graphics against the wall.  The sound system is pretty good and there are 29 TV's spread around the place.

The ceiling above the bar has a cool mural that has glow in the dark features with a black light that shows off those attributes.

The spot is across the street from El Hefe and Majerle's.  The amount of foot traffic they will get on the weekends will be tremendous.  This should be a winner.

We had a few comp drinks and left after a little while....it got crowded and we ran out of room to hang out.  I couldn't judge the service because we didn't stick around long enough and everyone is new.  The bartenders at the bar were fast in filing everyone's order and keeping up with the rush.

We will definitely come back to check it out on a weekend night.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here! 

First of all, I was kind of nervous about going there because it's a Saturday night, and I'm going there alone to have some fun. And I'm an Asian male. I have read about some reviews before and I was worried that I would be denied access. But surprisingly, the bouncer checked my ID and let me in. 

Secondly, the bartenders were friendly and helpful. I went to the bar almost at the same time as another group of people. This one bartender was going to ask me what to drink but realized the other group went first so turned to them (which is perfectly fine). And as she turned away, this other lady immediacy asked me what to order. She got my order quickly and accurately.

Finally, if you are looking for a club scene where drinks and LOUD music gets you high, this is the place. Even though I didn't come with my friends, I still had a great time! I met some nice people, drank, danced until the club started to clear out (which is about 2 am). 

I'm sure there were times that the bouncers or bartenders are rude for whatever the reason. But the experience I had was pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar/club in AZ! If you're in town and you are cool, you should come here. The management and staff are great!"}
{"text":"Great venue - very engaging service with the bartenders and the drinks were strong. Came here on a Monday when the Seahawks had just landed for the Super Bowl. The place was nuts! All of the Seahawks were in the bar, lining the walls. Atmosphere and energy was wonderful, and music was on point for the night. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Great Spot for Sunday Funday! The bottle service is pretty prompt and they typically comp you a few things! All in all a solid spot to eat and a wild time"}
{"text":"Great music but the place is usually packed on the weekends. If you want to dance in close quarters it's a good spot"}
{"text":"The bouncers in this place pick and choose who they'll allow to come in and have been know to discriminate then blame dress code policy. Stay away, there are much better options in Old Town."}
{"text":"This place was cool, we came on a Friday night around 11pm. Idk how people found parking, right I was pulled up someone was pulling out, so we got parking spot in front of INTL Night club. There was no line to get in and there was no cover charge. The place was relatively packed. I looked at the pictures in Yelp, which helped me determine my outfit. But the attire ranged from casual to upscale, I found something in the middle. I might consider not wearing heels if I come here again. The music was mostly EDM and Top 40. This place was not really my kind of scene, but I definitely had fun. One thing I did notice was that many of the security guards were very attractive ahahaha. Overall, I would come here again, I really want to try that fish bowl drink that I saw on here and maybe stop by during the day."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a friend's wedding from Orange County and had a great time here this past Friday.  I went there w/ a buddy of mine after we had dinner earlier.

There were tons of beautiful women here, the bartenders (some friendly, some not), the go-go dancers, and in the crowd.  I was pleasantly surprised because I'm from the LA area and there are tons of gorgeous women here but I haven't seen anything like the ratio they had here at Hi Fi.  Best part of the night was meeting a lovely girl from Minnesota even though for just briefly.

All in all I had a great weekend and going here was probably the highlight of my weekend.  I would definitely recommend you give this place a try and I would definitely return if I ever was in the area."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this new restaurant/bar last night, but was a tad crestfallen w/service as well as apps. Buttt... I really do WANT to LOVE this place and I'm thinking that I'll try again on a weekday night instead of late on Saturday. 

This place was packed last night and we waited for 10 min or so w/no sight of a server anywhere. I was just about ready to set up my smoke signals/flare gun, and my friend graciously went and got menus and asked at the bar if someone could wait on us.  

We ordered the Hummus/Pita and let me tell you - the hummus part was really awesome. However, the pita (they looked like fat steak fries) were overcooked and quite hard. I thought it would be uncouth to just eat hummus w/a spoon so I only had like 3-4 hard pita biscuits. Friend ordered the fries - they were just so-so.

Great job w/the décor! Love all of the screens, ceiling, music, etc. I think Hi-Fi will do well, but need to ramp up their late-night food service, IMO. :)"}
{"text":"So I went here on a Wednesday night because whack a$$ El Hefe doesn't allow Jordan's (black people wearing Jordan's in) service was decent in the beginning but the lame a$$ bouncer said I was lucky because becauae they don't allow Jordan's either... Yet they both allowed flip flops... Yeah whatever... Then we ask for our bill and we have to wait because some shit happened there... I don't give a sh!t if you have drama at your bar don't hold someone's credit card hostage when all they want to do is leave... Then walking out the patio exit I'm confronted by the gayest n'sync/jackass member ever and the retard tells me I can't go out that say because they keep a head count in who's going out?!?!?! Dude stop smoking sh!t it is affecting your ability to think. If you said it was policy I would understand but to lie about something that trivial, you insulted my intelligence.  Nobody at that bar could bounce anywhere I've bounced in California... That whole pussy crew would get mobbed. The highlight of the night was the waitress who didn't serve us... Thus  the 2 stars instead of one. I will never return and f@ck Scottsdale and the thousandaires... Broke fools trying to floss.. I wear my J's at real clubs in Cali and don't get sweated and I definitely don't have a wanna be pretty boy trailer trash f@ck lying to me about the dumbest sh!t. Stop catering to broke fools... Just cuz I don't dress like a douche doesn't mean in broke!"}
{"text":"Hit this place on our pub crawl. Forgive me but I spoke to some people who say this place is crazy after 11 pm. Like wall to wall partiers. It is on a hot corner on Whiskey Row. But we were early and one of three people inside, pretty much ignored by the bartender who was setting up. We didn't stay long and moved on. More to see...."}
{"text":"Place is overly crowded every time I come on the weekends. People are constantly pushing and the bouncers don't seem to care. I have had my credit card stolen from the bar and my phone stolen out of my purse."}
{"text":"Great music... Love the atmosphere! Different from San Diego. Enjoyed the vibe and the crowd. Very classy here -- not no ratchetville. No cover -- line was quick. Everyone was very friendly and respectful."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  I would *never* go here after sunset as that whole area is not my scene.  I'm not 24, so yeah no.  but I met friends here for football and considering they have a ton of tv's, it works.  It is relatively harmless in the day.

There are a few issues though:
the bathrooms were horrifying.  Trash everywhere, no paper , just a hot mess
don't order the wings. The sauce was great, but they weren't cooked enough and they were rubbery.  
Friends ordered the meatball appetizer and were served the meatball sliders.  They told the wait staff this and it took 35 minutes to get the replacement.  At this point most of the games were over and it wasn't that crowded. 

Our waitress was friendly though.  The rest?  Meh."}
{"text":"Great place to go out to drink and dance weekend nights. But they also have good brunch and lunch options during the day. During NFL games, this is the best place to go if you're a Steelers fan. They have a steelers themed menu, and they decorate the whole place in black and yellow. The service isn't always the quickest here, but the staff is very very friendly and they make it worth the wait! Their food is also surprisingly very good for a bar, you would except typical bar food, but it definitely exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"I loved this bar when I first came in and the music was fantastic! The waitresses were lousy, but I figured we could go up to the bar to get our drinks.

I ended up spending $50 on drinks and food, but when I go to look at my checking account today, they had 2 new pending charges on my card - one for $1 and one for $64.75! WTH?! 

.... now I have to go through the troubles of contacting my bank, getting a new debit card issued and going through a dispute with them over the new charges they put on my card when I haven't been in scottsdale since saturday!

I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! 

Word to the wise: check your card balance when you get home and for about a week later.... someone over there is being shady as hell and needs to get FIRED and/or ARRESTED!"}
{"text":"Lots of outdoor seating but the cushions either had cigarette burns or bird poop on them. The waitress was nice and the drinks were good."}
{"text":"If you're from the Scottsdale area or out of town and not sure where to go in Old Town on the weekends, HiFi is definitely the place. It's always consistently busy, the music is good, the food is GREAT (for bar-style), and the drinks are strong and reasonably priced compared to the rest of the Scottsdale scene. If you do plan on going to HiFi on the weekends, definitely try to get there earlier in the night (10pm-11pm) before it gets too busy. The line is always long past 11:30pm. The door staff and staff in general are friendly and strive to provide the best service possible. Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the second establishment I've gone to in the area by the same owners and the second time I've been charged for items I didn't order. The most recent was in a larger group for watching the fights at hifi. Our server disappeared a lot due to having to change outfits and then a new girl took over in the middle. We ended up ordering from the bar a lot and paying cash rather than waiting. When the bill comes at the end, we are charged for the items that were ordered separately and already paid for and other items that we never ordered. The server can't even recall who ordered what at that point. The original server stands her ground for the bill even though well over 50% of the time she wasn't there and we all end up over paying just so we can finally leave the place. Not sure what happened or the issue, maybe not knowing how to handle larger groups and tabs, or not changing to a new themed outfit in the middle of a shift or switching off to a different person in the middle may have helped. But one thing is for certain, if forced to go to one of these places: pay cash and pay as you go."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any steeler game. This place dedicated itself to Pittsburgh. They have a Steeler menu, decorations, a DJ, etc. I had the wings which were great quality, pretty meaty. I had the honey jalapeño (which I wouldn't recommend because it lacked the hot aspect) and the jack Daniels wings which were delicious. The JD wings were very saucy and had tons of flavor. TV's are everywhere and the line their patio with couches which is super cool. I give them 4 stars because you can smoke on the patio and when you're eating or drinking and smoke blows into your face, it's not pleasant. Other than that, it was a fun time!"}
{"text":"This place sucks I was the bar for 30 mins and got no service. Then I order 3 beers and all 3 was over a year old WTF... It's nothing spectacular about this place I came here on fight night.. I should have stayed home."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times, nice hangout spot.  Good food and drinks. Came by today and found out they are closed for renovations"}
{"text":"So, the day I decided to try out Hi Fi, it was pretty low key and a Saturday afternoon around four. Little did I know that about 10 minutes into being there it would turn into a crazy drunk fest that bordered on obscene. 
I sat at the bar with my husband and ordered a drink. The staff was awesome and incredibly nice. A group of five people came in and a couple of minutes later one of the girls in the group, who was wasted beyond belief, was actually climbing on the speakers on the back wall. She was so drunk that she was a liability at best for this place. She proceeded to do a photo shoot with her friends for the next 30 minutes on the wall of speakers. Yes, she climbed up on the booths and was standing on tables doing a photo shoot with her friends. Did I mention she pulled her skirt up to get it out of the way so she could get on the tables? Some of the poses were pretty gross. Nothing you want to see when you are having a relaxing drink on a Saturday afternoon. 

This sort of stuff happens, right? My problem is that she was not stopped. She was screaming and her group was obnoxious. The people next to us got up and left they were so over it. We decided to leave as well. Not my scene. I prefer a place with a little class. This is not it. 

I am sure the girl fell and sued the hell out of the place. She is probably now in the process of owning Hi Fi so no worries, it might close soon. 

You cant buy class and this place proves that point."}
{"text":"Hifi is def one of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale, the staff is amazing, the customer service is always great, and the vibe is awesome. I love the happy hour specials they have to offer and they have a really good selection and variety of food. If you're in the area this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I have a blast each time I go here.  Good music and bartenders make good drinks.  The people I've meet here so far are happy, outgoing and want to have a good time.  Only down side is it takes a while to get a drink sometimes because the bartenders get slammed."}
{"text":"Good time here on a Saturday night. They for sure cater to the bottle service crowd. We got bumped from a patio table around 11:30 , but thats business, I understand that. Our waitress was a nice looking long legged beauty, but she was a hard worker and took care of us really well. Gets crowded later, when we tried to leave, it was really packed, had a hard time moving out. I bumped some young, wanna be beauty a couple of times because is was so packed, this dummy told me to stop touching her. Really? Sorry honey, my hands dont go anywhere their not invited to, I gave her an upclose, \" Go Fuck Yourself\", the twit looked stunned. Everybody was bumping everyone. Also, I saw a bartender buy a Marine a drink, so patriots work their too. Good fun, will be back when in Scottsdale. Hopefully, the self described beauty wont be their."}
{"text":"Awesome environment with good music, friendly service, and tasty food! Everyone works together as a team which makes the atmosphere so much better."}
{"text":"Bar tender was rude. Bar tenders ignore you even when you order with them. I ask them a question and they looked at us and walked away from us. We ordered 4 drinks and they charged us 7 drinks and took 30 minutes to correct them once they got their attention."}
{"text":"The music is okay, and it gets SUPER packed. It's not a very big bar but people will squish in like sardines. Considering how loud and crazy it is in here, the bartenders were still nice and the prices for drinks were reasonable."}
{"text":"Love their adult milkshakes otherwise this bar is subpar. The atmosphere is like any other bar on saddlebag trail with a lot of speakers."}
{"text":"N\" mfch, hnBEm,nNH mn xhH Vz c cv; JCzww.k,bmc

Or, at least, that's what I wrote about this place months ago, probably in a somewhat intoxicated happiness that tends to result from spending time in Scottsdale.

Come here for the music, the lights, and a drunken good time with your friends. And maybe that cute girl at the next table over, by herself, sitting there sipping her drink and checking you out from head to toe.

Man, I knew I forgot something in Arizona."}
{"text":"I came here for the Husker game. Even though they are an Iowa bar, they accommodated us with some reserved seats. I got the 'bomb omelette' it comes with chorizo. It's was, indeed, BOMB. Unfortunately, once we moved to a table, we got a horrible server. I got the bottomless mimosa with the entree and I had to go to the bar every time I wanted a refill. She walked by three different times saying she would refill it and looked at me two other times, but never did. I shouldn't have had to awkwardly go to the bar every time I want I refill. The bartenders were so confused every time and told me my server could refill it...anyway-good food, good atmosphere, one bad server."}
{"text":"My review is not based on the nightlife. I work in the area so I frequent this establishment while the sun is still out, and not crowded. The staff is friendly, efficient, and the food is great. Believe it or not I prefer their salads...the salmon salad is my favorite, one of the best tasting salmon I have had."}
{"text":"DB central. Clientele and servers. 

Cool Space fan right in front of smoking area. 

Weird. Nice design in bathrooms but cheesy soft soap dispensers. And water faucet is literally 2\" above huge sink. No room to wash hands. Lame. 

Lazy servers

Soft soap in bathrooms."}
{"text":"A friend and I went on a Thursday night.  The place was busy.  We finally found a place to sit at a high-top table alongside others we didn't know, and waited for a server.  This blonde young girl wearing a communicating devise (obviously works there) comes up to the end of the table flirting with others at the end of the table.  My friend and I wave for her attention thinking she was the server.  She looks at us with a surprised and disgusted look.  We say that we would like to order some food, she replies, \"and?  I'm a hostess.\"  And walks away.  Amazingly she did get us a server, whom was very nice.  The food is good, even though they screwed up my order and left off some of the items that come with the plate I ordered.  The crowed was young like young 20 something's.   I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"I decided to do a Sunday Fun day with friends ... We had  went to Hi Fi before an had  a fun experience. So we decided to do it again . But this time around could be the worse ever experience .. We got in fairly fast an headed towards a table, a friend had rented .While being helped up by the security guard who was watching the table we began to dance... An a short time later, I was forcefully grabbed an yanked off where I was dancing. When I go to look up it was the same security guard who had helped me up.. I was caught by surprise . Since a ex boyfriend was at the same table as I ,an he was not happy he had the security  guard forcefully remove me without any warning . Then as I go to reach for my purse calmly since I was removed so fast.. I was yelled at that I was not to come near the table an then he shoved me down the stairs an shoved my purse into my chest  . I was in total shock with how I was treated . I then went to the patio , to collect my self an stop crying !!! My friends came to see if I was all right .. They where told they could stay at the table but I could not. We decided  to leave  an I  then asked the  same security guard why he so rudely handled the situation. An his comment to me was he could do what ever the fuck he wanted ... I then went up to a host an asked to see a manager to talk about what had happened .Waited for 20 minutes an no manager came to talk to me ...So i decided to leave .. I now have a bruise on my arm where the security guard yanked me from the table.. I am now waiting for  a call back from Hi Fi . Which has not happened yet !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night for a friend's 21st birthday. I've been here several times and it's a bit hit or miss for me. I think it largely depends on my mood. 

PRO's: Awesome for people watching as there are usually a good combination of \"interesting\" people mixed with beautiful people. Prices aren't outrageous and I've never paid a cover charge here. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat. A good place to amuse young (21-23 year olds) friends/relatives. 

CON's: A little on the douchey side at times. I don't know if it's more unique to Scottsdale than the bar itself but be prepared to be scrutinized openly by other patrons. Also, it's one of those bars where the music is loud but there's seemingly a lack of dance space. Most people congregate by the front to dance which is somewhat awkward. Also, be prepared to wait an eternity for a drink. 

Overall, this bar is okay if you're literally looking for an \"Old Town\" experience such as a 21st birthday but not really one of my favs. I don't hate it but I don't love it either."}
{"text":"ordered my order. then i witnessed the waitress clock out, wave by to her friends, and leave. I held out and hoped that she had somehow conveyed my order via ESP to a cook somewhere back in the kitchen. But thirty minutes later, I just had to order again with another waitress. I was a sad Charlie Brown. 

Thankfully, the beer cheese is, in fact, quite bomb. Beer Cheese is really the easiest way back into my heart. 

Also, their adult milkshakes are super bomb too. which is the second easiest way back into my heart

Thus, i was about to give these guys three stars, but i talked myself out of it and gave them 4. i am a push over"}
{"text":"Not sure if what they are doing is legal: I like the music and the set up a lot, the bar tender decided to charge me $6 for a cup of water, she justified the charge as a \"fill\" and it wasn't that I was only ordering it alone, I ordered two mixed drinks and a beer along with it. Needless to say she did not get a tip."}
{"text":"Love the Reuben with the side salad! The bomb!!! Crave it all the time!! Heard the shakes are great, but have not tried one yet! I will tho...."}
{"text":"We just tried getting in and they turned us away because my buddy was black. I didn't believe it at first. Their excuse was because he was wearing Jordan's. We stood outside for a second and they turned away another group of black guys. I spoke to the guys and they said Hi Fi made up some bullshit excuse.  I watched for a little longer and 95% of potential black clientele was turned away. That some racist a$$ sh!t. My buddy served our country. This establishment should be ashamed to hang up a military flag. My buddy showed them his military ID.  Shut this place down."}
{"text":"This place is nice, except when it's a weekend night. It is way too crowded in there. The line didn't take too long to get in, but it feels like they honestly let way too many people inside. That makes the experience worse. Getting pushed around, having no personal space at all. When trying to navigate over to the bar and back to your friends, that's a long process."}
{"text":"Security handled my situation very poorly in thinking I was resisting to an accident that involved me slipped and spilling a drink as I offered to purchase the gentleman a drink security put me in a chokehold for absolutely no reason and continued to choke tighter even after I repeatedly told him I'm not resisting please let go and after being escorted out I wanted an explanation on why he handled the situation in such ways but of course security slipped away with this one"}
{"text":"This place definitely gets so crowded that you can hardly move, but while waiting for a drink I was shoved by one of the bartenders and told to get the f out of his way so he could get behind the bar. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Bravo management, bravo. They reached out to me for my feed back and say they do take their service seriously. For that I award you two extra stars!

-----

If you're looking for eye candy, this is your place.  If you're looking for service faaaaa-get-about it.  I mean, wow, really?  I'm trying to write this review in simple words because the people who typically go to this place probably can't read on more than a 5th grade level.  

We sat and waited for someone to serve us for 20 minutes, and then asked one of the roided out Scottsdale douchbag bouncers to grab a waitress.  Does he apologize for the wait? Nope.  He walks up and walks away because all he could think about was his next protein shake, his next tattoo (probably a cross or something really cliche like a quote from Corinthians), or how he's going to make another payment on his bmw 3 series that he's leasing while still living at home and trying to impress the very girls that work there.  This is the guy who says \"I know the owner\" everywhere he goes.  This is the guy who has an affliction v-neck.  This is the guy who has friends named Brock and hunter.  

Dear upper management, take a moment to train your staff on a simple concept: service trumps 

I'm surrounded by buffoons."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the bar. There seemed to be an abundance of staff standing around, including one girl examining a tattoo she had on her side. Anyway, we waited for about a minute. No one even glanced in our direction, so needless to say, we did not receive any service. We walked out and went directly next door to Whiskey Row. Not surprised Hi Fi was nearly empty while the other surrounding bars had full patios. Step up your customer service game, Hi Fi. It was sad and awful."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday, unfortunately.  After being harassed to bring over 50 people for a party bus, instead of the 40 in my original party (which they didn't even have a table big enough for that many people seeing as we were squeezed shoulder to shoulder with no seating room), HI FI provided none of their promised services.  Once we finally got in the club and went to the table where we were supposed to have bottle service that an assistant general manger promised we would have, about 8 bouncers came and started yelling at us and grabbed me and pulled me out of the table, yet they couldn't even tell us why.  

After about 45 minutes of trying to figure out what was going on, and having no drinks all night, they tried to have us go to the Mint, one of their sister clubs. After being passed off to 3 different promoters, I literally overheard the manager say to another manager that he had no idea I even had a table. The management obviously has no idea what is going on their own clubs, the bouncers are paid thugs and have no respect for women, and the promoters won't respond if something doesn't go their way.  

I still am in disbelief that a bouncer grabbed me and threw me out of my own birthday party and could only say \"you don't belong here, get out, this table doesn't belong to you.\"  I will never go back and neither will my 50 guests.  I hope if people make the horrible decision to go to this bar they don't get harassed and they get what is promised to them.  After reading some of the other reviews I am not at all surprised about the mismanagement.  We probably would have had to pay for drinks we never got (except we never got any service anyways).  This club can't close soon enough. To be honest, the only reason I didn't give this club 1 star is because I wanted this review to hold some weight rather than people just scroll by it."}
{"text":"Seriously?? -__-     ....... I'm sorry, but HELL NO! This place SUCKS!

I've only gone once, last Saturday night so you don't necessarily have to value my opinion, but whatever lol. My friend and I are semi new to AZ and were bouncing around Scottsdale, we asked the little golf cart driver guy for a fun place to check out and he recommended Hi Fi... weaaaahhhhhhhhh! WRONG!

We got there and this place was like a sardine can!! SUPER wayy too packed! There was NO room for dancing, or even just mingling. Frankly, you couldn't even breathe!! Brushing elbows? More like brushing noses! It was miserable and as soon as I felt my claustrophobia kicking in I needed to escape! We found a small patch of dry unsticky floor next to the VIP booths to stand on, it was elevated and probably 8 inches wide, but we stood there for a minute to catch our bearings and not get shoved around (we're only 5'1\" lol we almost drowned!) Oh and order a drink to relax? Faget about itt! It would have taken hours!

El Hefe was exactly the same! (which I'm about to review next), but who wants to \"party\" like that?? I want to be able to mingle, get a drink fairly quick, DANCE and I don't know have room to breathe and chill out. I know places may be popular and \"thee place to be\", but it would seem way more exclusive and maybe even worth paying entry if the atmosphere was right.

Like really Hi Fi they have \"maximum occupancy\" laws for a reason! I could not imagine what would happen if a fire broke out! This place is not only NOT fun, but also NOT safe! 

I don't see myself ever going back on a Sat night, I don't know if it's different on other nights, but I digress, the ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars and not 1 is because my friend and I didn't have to wait in their long ass line. We walked up to the front and they just let us in lol."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend during the day and to my surprise the food was amazing. Had the Pretzel Bites and Buffalo Chicken dip as an app which was great, then I had the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich to top it off. If you order any of those three items you will definitely not be disappointed. Knowing that this place was primarily a nightclub kind of worried me for food, my worries are no more. 
Excited to try this place out at night."}
{"text":"I assume this will level off after the hype dies down (I'll be back in several months). For now it's the latest \"douche fiesta\" in old town...  I like the style of the place and the food/drinks seem to be above par - but the nighttime crowd is mostly comprised of obnoxious drunken children visiting from Smashboxxx and El Hefe. In fact, if you're over 30 and/or not a professional model steer clear."}
{"text":"Hi Fi pretty cool place to meet up with people. Gets really busy on weekends, need to get here early or make reservations. Staff are great, got us in the VIP line. Dance club at night and Sports venue during the day. Hi Fi is connected with Bottled Blond across the street. And people bounce between clubs. Same type venue over there as well. Several night clubs in a 2 square block radius that look good as well."}
{"text":"Tried to make plans for getting a table for a steelers game since this is a steelers bar. If you dont have reservations you cant get a seat. Unfortunately after trying for about 4 days to reserve a table- we keep getting passed around to different numbers and people to talk to but no one can actually get anything done. We also submitted a basic online inquiry which was responded to once- when we asked about getting a reservation for the steelers game there was no reply. This is unacceptable service for a bar that I used to frequent but will no longer keep in the rotation."}
{"text":"Some of the things that owners Les and Diane Corieri really do not want to be known for is their lack of support an Arizona sports team like the Wildcats of Tucson. Their bouncers & management are on ego trips. Food not bad but their attitude stinks I'm glad there are many more place to go to in the area. Boycott & go U OF A"}
{"text":"Okay first off, this place gets one star...and all I did was stand in the doorway! I have never experienced an such injustice as I have had here at this establishment. Do not go to Hi Fi unless you A) have a deep conditioned and obviously highlighted man bun, B) A black v-neck accentuating your lack of of a body, or C) have a sick sense of entitlement and the mentality that your mother squeezed you into this world and God blessed the very earth with your presence to literally nod people into a second rate bar. My anger is incredible towards this place...but it is warranted. I came here with friends for a birthday and we waited in line patiently because we had men in our group, mind you these are black men, and before you say \"Oh boy, here's another #blacklivesmatter, stand outside with a black t-shirt and fist raised, angry black woman\" let me tell you, you're wrong. I really don't give in easily to the politics of this social media fueled rabble rousing. But I do give a crap about fairness and equality. Our male black companions were denied from entering the establishment because of their race, despite the bouncers feeble attempt at blaming it on their attire...every other man being granted entry was wearing the same shoes and clothes...so we called the bouncer out and this is how the conversation went:
Friend 1: Well those men just went in with the same shoes!
Friend 2: It's not about the clothes or shoes is it?
Bouncer: You read my mind.

That's all I have to say about this place. My friends birthday night was ruined and it hurt me right in my gut that this kind of stuff happens and I was there to witness it."}
{"text":"***Keep your credit card receipt and watch your statement after your visit here.  Unfortunately (like a few other Scottsdale locations) they either over charge (i.e. your credit card receipt says one thing and your card statement says another)  or charge your card multiple times.      

It's Old Town Scottsdale so the 'scene' is typical of many of the bars in the area.  We met up with some friends who had already claimed an outside/patio table for 6, the 2 of us made 8 so we sat at the end of the table.  Service was doing what they could to get through the throngs of people, but we were left thirsty and wondering, more times than not, where was our server .  The saving grace was the company we were with and the DJ was playing some pretty fresh mixes.  [Yeah I am a sucker for a good DJ.]

The food looked good and the menu was unique.  If you are looking for a little fun and a typical days worth of calories, they have these adult shakes mixed with booze, ice cream, favorite kids breakfast cereal favorites and other stuff.  While I can not personally caloric-ally afford the whole shake it may be fun to try if treated as a shared desert between a few people at a table."}
{"text":"The WAll of Speakers is pretty fresh. 
All the Girls who work there, look like they do at least 4 days of workouts on their stomachs. It has an open air atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you get a Groupon for a place you THINK will be awesome and have it's customer service down pat. I made the mistake in thinking Hi-Fi was one of those places. We had brunch for the first time here today and it was a \"experience\" to say the least. It started out great, with a friendly waitress and the manager doing table checks with all of the patrons. But where our Sunday brunch started to go downhill was when my boyfriends burger came out waaaayyy over cooked, and my eggs Benedict was missing it's side of potatoes. We had to wait just to track down our waitress just so we could send it back. That was annoying, then we had to wait an extra 15 minutes for a medium rare burger and my missing order of breakfast potatoes. During the wait my boyfriend orders an non alcoholic milkshake which didn't even make it to our table until we were paying. Then comes the issue with the bill. We intentionally ordered extra stuff beyond our groupon limit just to make sure we weren't just taking advantage of an online deal. So we had a tab of $10 after our groupon was applied. I have her $22 and asked for $5 meaning she could keep the rest as a tip. Well she NEVER came back to the table after dropping off the milkshake, trying to keep a $12 tip!! My boyfriend had to track her down and ask for change back. Then as we were walking out, the security harasses my boyfriend in attempts to say there was alcohol in his milkshake and that he couldn't leave with it. Needless to say, groupon or not, I'm never coming back to this establishment! So what if I'm walking distance? Plenty of other, more attentive and honest restaurants are within walking distance too! It started out ok, but when the order is wrong, takes forever to get fixed and them the waitress KEEPS your change, there's no hope of me returning."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great DJs, cool lights and decor and beautiful people."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for some happy hour drinks and food.  Ordered the Market Kale Salad with chicken and it had a little extra surprise in it.  As I was on my 3rd bite I ran across a huge red hair in my salad.  Needless to say I sent it back.  Avoid the food!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour where it was practically dead, but since we're vacationers, we took up on sitting outside and we loved our few dollars beers and burger bites. They were delicious! Our waitress was nice and it was a good hang out spot. We heard this is great during the weekend days too."}
{"text":"This place blows for watching a UFC fight, what bar doesn't turn off the music? Manager had shitty follow through, at least the mediocre food wasn't highly priced... Though, would have paid more to hear the fight."}
{"text":"I have never understood why hi fi is so crowded.  The set up is squeezed in with almost no room for dancing and the only places to sit are in the VIP booths if you're getting bottle service. Hi Fi brings in all sorts of people from different races, but they are so incredibly douchey and a bit unattractive as a whole, its not even funny."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible place. While here with my boyfriend a staff member was repeatedly bumping into him. The worker was extremely rude and told us that we should have apologized for being in the way. After not apologizing because we hadn't done anything wrong but just stand there he went on a power trip and said I'm the general manager of this place and you are going to have to leave. I asked why and he said because your boyfriend is rude. He called two security guards to walk my boyfriend to the door. It was absolutely ridiculous. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night for a friends birthday around 11pm. It was very crowded, loud and busy. My Girlfriend was feeling claustrophobic and saw a friend sitting on a outside on a patio table that was basically empty. She walked up and sat with her. I followed but remained standing a few feet behind to keep a eye on the rest of the people. The waitress (was told her name was \"Jess\") who must have been assigned that section decided she wanted to scream, drop f-bombs and mentally freak out on my girl friend and her friend because it was a private table ( no signs at all of it being private). Thing was it was so bloody loud they couldn't hear her screaming at them. Instead of walking politely up to them and making eye contact, then asking them to leave because it was a private table, she called security on them. Before the 6 security showed up I simple walked up to them and told my girl it was a private area and they needed to leave. Which they where very sorry and didn't know. Jess decided to make a quick nasty remark as they left the patio. I remained to explain to one of the security guards that the waitress acted absolutely unprofessional and she shouldn't be so quick to call security on a simple mistake that she should have addressed. And mind you my girl and her friend where complete clueless to everything that happened sense I was the only one hearing the waitress and Witnessing her mental breakdown. I've been bartending for a long time and been in the industry longer. I've never in all my years seen someone freak out like this girl did on paying customers who where completely clueless to the situation and where making a honest mistake in the first place. She will not fit or will last in the customer service industry and her actions reflect very very poorly on your business. I hope you as a company take the correct steps to make this right, make sure the correct punishment and conversation happens and to educate your staff on how to be polite when the environment is loud and busy. Because if the nice security guard can do it, your wait staff should be able to as well. Very disappointed and will make sure to share my experience with the industry."}
{"text":"It all depends on what you like.

I went here twice.  Once on a Tuesday night and another time on a Friday night.

Cliff's notes:  If you like the \"club scene\", go on Friday.  If you're like me, you'll love Tuesdays here.

The first time I came here, it was a Friday night.  The line to get in was incredibly long.  The amount of alcohol-infused testosterone in this club causes numerous fights to break out and allow turnover to occur.  I was able to get in very quickly as a result.  It was hard to move around and it's a danger zone because some men can't handle competition and think it's manly to get into fights.  BOO!  I hated this place on Friday night.  Too much drama.  The music sucks too.  I don't know why people like listening to this top-40 crap all of the time, but it's ruining our society as a whole.  So is fighting over very small things.  People here have no ethics.  An acquaintance got pick-pocketed at Hi Fi.

Tuesday--I was reluctant to go to this place on Tuesday after all the immaturity and debauchery from Friday.  I had very low expectations for Hi Fi until I walked into the building.  It was a completely different place.  It had a wonderfully quiet ambience, friendly staff, and great happy hour deals!  I was so impressed with everything, but it was a shame I couldn't stay longer at this amazing place.  I'll never go to the club here again, but you'll likely find me here for Happy Hour.

FOUR STARS--it would've been FIVE if Old Town's disgusting weekend club/bar culture didn't exist.  And if it wasn't a NY Giants bar."}
{"text":"All - come here if you want to waste your money on the very reason people hate Scottsdale girls - fake and a rip off. If you have any girls who are friends that you would bring to your table you're better off elsewhere so they do not get harassed. 

Last night went to a table I was invited to and was pretty sober all night. Logan put on an appalling display throughout every interaction and that is putting it lightly. I've never been so disgusted. 

Logan was the server and our troubles started when she backed that ass up into my legs resulting in physically moving me from my seat almost physically knocking me off of the table onto the ground. It was appalling and gross. 

As I go to grab myself a drink, she pours 1/3 a bottle of Dom all over her own and the other bottle girls chest. Shortly after another bottle comes out. 
Side note: you're not good at sales if you have to damage the existing product to make another sale. 

Moving forward, this new bottle comes out. Logan pours herself a nice large glass to the brim, meanwhile, my friend and I who were invited to the table and not on the clock had a small sip of champagne poured into our glass. 
Due to the lack of drinks I was able to get at a table I was specifically brought to by the girl whose job it is to pour drinks, I asked per personally for a new one and said that I wanted pineapple. She poured a tiny glass of vodka, no ice, and says pineapple is not at the table. I ask her to go get more pineapple. She then claims we're out of the bottle so I ask for the other type of alcohol with pineapple mixed. 

Logan holds up cranberry and tells me she doesn't want to get the pineapple and proceeds to pour me this mix of vodka and tequila that would even be considered rancid at a frat party. 

I'm deathly allergic to cranberries and she almost killed me by putting cranberry in my drink (and she almost broke my bones knocking me off of the table). Luckily, instead she chose to pour the rest of the tables alcohol into a full plastic glass and ran away with it so nobody got to drink from then on out.

Never again HiFi. Try finding girls who can perform basic job functions. You truly should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Hi fi has some really hungry money employees, I couldn't step into the place unless I showed the bouncer a 20$ bill his name is Brandon, how can you be a bouncer an except bribes come on now let's be real. I even told him the only money I had on me at the time besides my debit card was a $5 bill, he wasn't accepting it.Worst part about it was he was letting in both genders for free before us.  After I told him what he was doing was wrong,and I wanted to speak to his manger,he called for security and got 3 security guards on roids to shove me all at the same time, until i was at least 100ft from the place. I wouldn't waste my time or energy to go to place like this. Totally unprofessional how the bouncer handled the whole situation.I usually don't go out of my way to write a bad review on a place, but I couldn't help my self in this particular case.Theres so many better choices you can go to bar wise in old town than this place."}
{"text":"I probably would have loved this place in my early 20s. We went there on a Sunday for a little football bar action. The wait staff appeared extremely busy so it was difficult to order anything. There was a DJ blaring music during the commercial breaks of the Philly Eagles game. My friends and I gave up talking within 10 minutes of sitting down because it was so extremely loud in there (is that the point? God I'm old). The food was decent, better than typical bar fare. Reasonably decent beer selection. Will I ever go back? I hope not. Would rather look for food in a trash can than go through that experience again."}
{"text":"First time in Scottadale via Los Angeles. This place is an absolute must go - the energy, the music, the great attitudes, and most importantly, the service.  Ioana as a server was amazing and everything I would love to see when coming to visit a city. Drew the GM also was more than an inviting manager. Made sure we were more than satisfied customers. Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with co-workers at Hi Fi on a Thursday night. Great cocktails and good dancing. Also, I must RAVE about the staff / customer service - Asst. GM Michael M is fabulous! He went out of his way to take care of us. Thanks Michael!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think it's bullshit you have to pay 300$ to sit down when you are a guy and have nice shoes but people in flip flops get on and have free reign of the place. Scottsdale has stupid rules and hi fi is stupid for enforcing them."}
{"text":"Beer is cold and Fun place to watch Iowa Football but not the friendliest of staff----none of them seem to be living their job and probably the worst fried pickles I've had.  Then we tried the walking taco.....yuck.   Not sure food is their specialty haha."}
{"text":"Our server was awesome. The food was actually good and there were decent sized portions for the price. Based on that alone, I'm inclined to give more stars. 

EDIT: HiFi has apparently complained about the implications of my last review. I simply shared that I believe someone in our group was treated unfairly. He did not act out nor did anyone in our group as a result; we paid and appropriately tipped our awesome wait staff. I only wanted to share with you all my experience of their policies. Unfortunately they see this differently and have not contacted me to ask how to be a better business and serve their patrons. They reported me."}
{"text":"Not the best brunch service. Long waits for food and very little attention.  Great atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Nope. 

Nope. Nope. Nope.

It was Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III's birthday celebration, and I was unable to get in the front door.

Working at the loudest and the newest bar in Scottsdale does not make you a GOD, Gorilla Juice-head Bouncer. I stood in line for 15 minutes at the front of the line, while I watched 30 people grease the bouncer and walk right in. Not having any cash in my pocket meant that I was shit out of luck.

So I walked away. The decor of the place seems awesome, but I'm not going to put up with that pretentious bullshit."}
{"text":"I have had a sour taste in my mouth about this place since they turned down my friend & wouldn't let him because he was wearing Jordan's. We were out for a Sunday funday it was myself, him & 5 other girls in our group. Us girls went first had our IDs checked no problem then it got to him & they told him he could not come in because he was wearing Jordan's. When I heard, I went to the Door Guy/Security & mentioned to him there was a white guy sitting at a table/couch that was wearing Jordan's that they had let in, so why couldn't my friend who is Black. The security guard didn't say anything about it and repeated he couldn't come in because of his shoes. So we all left. I have not been back since..this was so disrespectful, my friend was dressed in nice jeans, nice shirt & he even showed his Military ID but I hear this happens a lot not only at Hi-Fi & other bars/clubs in Scottsdale."}
