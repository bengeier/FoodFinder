{"text":"Thos place told us it would take forty minutes for our pizza to be delivered. Called after an hour and they swore it was on its way and hung up immediately. Called again twenty minutes later and refused to give us a straight answerS Awful customer service and we are still waiting for our pizza. It's been almost two hours."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte hands down and the family that runs it and their crew are always great people to talk with. I usually get a roasted garlic pizza with garlic butter crust and it's amazing! Support a local business and get some great old school pizza. Love you guys!! Bout to dig in now"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!!! I Ordered a pizza from this company for the first time disregarding all the bad reviews, when ordering i specifically asked to parm and crushed pepper packets being this is the only way we eat pizza. The delivery guy came with neither i still tipped a very good tip and he assured me that he was going to go get them and come right bk being it was on the reciept and im only 6 mins from the business, 15 min later i called the and the manager said he was on his way to me, i waited another 20 min and called back after no one showed up. so now 45 mins later in stuck with cold pizza the managers excuse was he had other deliveries to take care of and he would get to me after... What a slap in the face i proceeded to ask what he would like me to do with the cold pizza he said i could return it and get a refund but he would not compensate me for it nor would he discount it for thier mistake and that my only option was to suck it up and eat the cold pizza and wait for the crushed peppers and parm which i add still hasn't came or refund it and give the delivery guy the pizza and get the refund. After the nasty attitude and no respect for a customer who's putting money in thier pocket i decided to get a refund so he said he would call the delivery guy and inform him, when the delivery guy finally showed up he had no idea what was going on so he asked to use my phone to call his manage, he put the phone on speaker and the managers exact words were \" Yea my nigga give her a damn refund and if the pizza was touched dont give her shit\"! I was shocked but not in disbelief the words that came out of his mouth! I will never order anything from this place ever again, that was my first and last time, I wasted time and money! I WOULDN'T ADVISE ANYONE TO EAT HERE AND JUST IN CASE YOU WANT TO PRESS YOUR LUCK JUST KNOW THAT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG AND THEY MAKE A MISTAKE THATS NOT YOUR FAULT THEY DONT CARE AND THE ONLY OPTIONS YOU'LL HAVE IS TO GET A REFUND OR DEAL WITH IT! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I DID UNFORTUNATLEY!!! YOU WILL REGRET EATING HERE!!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst pizzas I've had during my business travels in a long time.  The delivery took over 1 hour and 20 minutes on a Tuesday evening.  After being recommended by the manager at a hotel by Charlotte International, I told them they should toss the remaining menus instead of handing them out to guests."}
{"text":"Where I live, no one wants to step foot in the area.  Not because it's a bad neighborhood, I just don't think they've put it on the map as one of the places to deliver too......maybe it's cause they \"think\" it is a bad neighborhood, who knows.  However, Mr. Jim's Pizza is the only pizza joint that isn't scare to deliver to the Wilmore area, and I'm pretty grateful for that, because they are one of the best local pies I've ever had locally.  Tried them out on a whim and scored big time.  Jet's delivers all the way from Montford, but their quality is shotty at best by not being consistent with their pies.  Mr. Jim's has always been consistent every time I order, and that's what I look for.  Don't fret, I won't steer you wrong here, give it a shot."}
