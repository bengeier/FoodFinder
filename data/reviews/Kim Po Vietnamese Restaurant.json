{"text":"Great late night pho! Open til 4 am. The server is friendly too. Fair pricing, very good overall experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a long time even before the renovated. Taste here is constant and is always delicious. I'm one of the people that always get the house special which is far from bad. Would recommend people to come if your looking for a viet restaurant in the area"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We had the appetizer sampler and 2 noodle dishes.  Very fresh and tasty. The food was served quickly.   Affordable prices.   We thought the service was poor, then we discovered the buttons on the table.  When we pressed \"bill\" he was there in 3 seconds.  There are also buttons for order, water, service.  It's a unique system.  I give 4 stars because they didn't explain this system, and generally the wait staff didn't seem to want to be there.  We will return."}
{"text":"All I can say is stay away from this place.. Horrible experience with the employees and food just horrible.."}
{"text":"Accueil chaleureuse et sincère. Même si a l'heure du souper il n'y a presque personne, le personnel vous met rapidement à l'aise. Leur rush se trouve surtout sur l'heure du dîner. Nourriture très bonne, goûteuse et fraîche.  Bonne appétit!"}
{"text":"They did a nice job with the renos.  It looks much nicer now and their menu has stayed pretty much the same.  Their food and service is always consistent. They bring the food out fairly quickly and their food is pretty good.  It's not the cheapest but it's not the most expensive either.  I will continue to visit as their soups are flavourful and everything I've tried is is pretty good.  I like getting the pho in the tom yum soup.  I know that's not pho but I like!"}
{"text":"Beware! Not really viet food and everything is super salty. :(  Ordered bun bo hue, it tasted like curry??"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 times now!!! I always like pho, because it's quick, and good cold days!   This particular pho restaurant is very clean, compared to many may pho places! They have lots of different variety of vietnamese dishes. Most places usually only serve the soup noodles, rice dish, and vermicelli. This Kim Po also serve the rice paper wrap platter, that allows you to wrap it yourself and it's good value too, about $10-12 per order.  What they also serve is \"Beef in seven style\". Its about $30 per order, I am going to try that next time. Also, their large pho is a true large, you can really good portion of noodles and beef! Their soup base tastes very good too, I normally don't drink the soup at all, but I cannot resist at this place  If you are in Markham / Richmondhil area, and craving for a pho, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Used to be nice pho place. But getting more and more pricey,and food quality didn't catch up. Hard to find parking spot at rush hour"}
{"text":"So I decided I would give this restaurant one last try for lunch today and I am so sorry I did.  About half way through my vermicelli and chicken a big brown cockroach crawled across the table and up the wall beside me. I tried to kill it unsuccessfully and then showed the waitress all she said as she smashed it on the wall was \"oh sorry\". I promptly asked for the bill as I wasn't sitting around in a roach infestation.  The waitress asked me if I wanted my food to go and was really surprised when I said no.  Even now just thinking about the fact I ate half my food is making me feel like vomiting.  For heavens sake, call the Orkin man or something....just disgusting.  NEVER GO HERE!!!!!"}

{"text":"not bad, been a few times now, prices are decent and the broth is good!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. Decent food and good price. Services are not too bad. Just a little slow when waiting for food."}
{"text":"Let me tell you guys, I had a crazy craving late last night for Pho. So I made it happen. I had to return to Kim Po to see what this place was like when I'm not intoxicated.  WHAT a night & day difference eating here when you're drunk or sober haha.   There are many PHO restaurants in Toronto, but few that are open late. You have to take it for what it is.   Soup base has enough flavour, so you don't have to squirt half a bottle of MSG sauce. Noodles are good, not soggy or funky tasting like a few ghetto places I've been too. The sliced beef and brisket taste that same as any other Pho. Beef Tendon tasted kinda funky, but probably because it's been sitting in the pot all day.  If you're looking for the traditional Pho Taste, this will not be your place. BUT if you have a late night craving, hit this place up. It will satisfy your taste buds and hey if it doesn't. There's a McD's across the street.   Till next time!"}
{"text":"Kim Po food and service had dropped a lot since the last time I came here. Being a frequent customer back in high school, I came a lot  when the food was good and the servers were attentive. However, last night when I came with my friend the servers kept ignoring us while the restaurants wasn't busy at all and the servers could clearly see us. This will be my last time coming to Kim Po since there's a lot of other places that serve pho in thornhill"}
{"text":"Ordered a Tom Yum noodle soup, ummm... saltiest thing I've ever eatten in a long time.  It was spicy, and SALTY.  It was like a entire box of salt was thrown in the soup pot.   Once is enough."}
{"text":"Renovation: they forgot to do the washrooms Service: the servers are unhappy and it shows  Food: edible  Ordered the beef done 7 ways.. shouldve stuck with Pho"}
{"text":"Good food at a low cost They have specials from mon to thu, i always get D, its a small house special pho with deep fried spring roll, really good"}
{"text":"Okay, this isn't my go-to place or anything...but if I don't want a cramped pho restaurant and it's on the way a little bit, I'll come in for a bowl.  It's not the best, it's okay.   When we went recently, it didn't seem that dirty (like other reviewers have mentioned). I actually even thought to myself, \"huh, not bad\" when I went to the washroom. Some places the floors have this icky film and it's all sticky and gross, but I didn't experience that here.  It's fine."}
{"text":"I only come here for the pho so I can't say anything about the other items on their menu.  The pho itself is great and I havent found another restaurant that does it better. The service on the other hand, is not that great but for the prices you pay you can't complain too much.   Another user below said they jacked up their prices (only by a dollar) but i think its only fair since the price of beef and pork have risen quite a bit. The price of a meal is still very inexpensive.  All in all, I would recommend this restaurant for a very casual and quick dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews.   Tried out the pho and they only have two sizes...small or large.  1) Large size, if you are really hungry otherwise a small size will do.  2)The beef was not cut up properly, they thought we were in the jungles or something and that we had lion's teeth.  3) The order was really simple, Rare beef + Tripe + Beef Balls.  When we got it, Tripe was missing.  However they corrected themselves after when we asked.  Overall, we only had the pho here was not too bad for a first time."}
{"text":"The food and service was mediocre at best. I paid 10 cents short of 10% tip and the owner chased me down as I left for the extra 10 cents."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since my friend recommended it. I ordered the vermicelli with spring rolls and bbq pork. It was good but I specially asked for no beansprouts or veggies but it still had cucumbers and beansprouts. My friend ordered the lamb roti which he enjoyed. My dish was good but if only they had followed my instructions."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kim Po for over 8 years! Back when the establishment had it's old decor with art on the ceiling.   Food Quality & Price: Pho is always great at this location, plenty of ingredients and noodles. They are thinner noodles and the broth is refreshing. The Hai Nam chicken is also exceptional. If you do take out, though, just get a size small because large and small is very similar. Prices here have always been fair.  Facility: New decor and renovations look great but the washroom still looks exactly the same.  Kim Po could invest their money to make this part of the restaurant reflect the quality of the rest. Noise level ranges from quiet to average unless it is packed on a weekend evening.   Service: Fast and efficient.  The servers are not very attentive but they get the job done. Pretty average quality service with not much to comment on.  Overall: Kim Po is a convenient and delicious place to go for a cheap dinner. I think this review was long overdue and it comes from experience over many years and visits. It is a little different in that I am not rating a one time dine-in but to attest that in the hundreds of times I have been here, I have never been disappointed with bad quality or service."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I have been a patron of this establishment for more than 10 years, firstly because it was just where my parent took me when I was younger but now it is my favourite choice in the Richmond Hill area for good vietnamese food.    Kim Po continues to be a favourite of mine first and foremost because the Pho never disappoints.  The soup broth is substantial in flavour, savoury and well balanced.  The rice noodles in the pho are more so a thin, long square cut which doesn't break or become soggy in the soup.  I usually order the rare beef and tripe pho and I can guarantee you that even with a small, the portions of noodles/meat/broth are generous.   The cold rolls are fairly standard and what you would expect cold rolls to be, crunchy lettuce, pork, and noodles wrapped in rice paper.  Very refreshing way to start a meal.  I would recommend ordering the spring rolls which are fried.  The fried wrapper is crispy and exudes flavour with the first bite. Not greasy tasting at all.    The service is acceptable.  Do not expect a waiter or waitress to be coming back to your table to ask how your food was, it just isn't that kind of a restaurant.  They will however, take your order, bring you your food, and go to your table if cued fairly quickly.  To be honest I enjoy restaurants such as this for this reason, so I would recommend this establishment if you want to enjoy a quick lunch or dinner without being interrupted too much.  Usually costs about $14 (tax and tip included) for a bowl of pho and an appetizer course."}
{"text":"I been to 2 other kim po, the one at time square and on steeles across from Pacific Mall. They are both very good and I go there to satisfy myself when I am craving for Pho. However, this Kim po that recently opened severed the worse pho I have eaten. The soup base was not hot. The noodle were soft and breaks apart. The rare beef was nasty because of the cold soup base. The spring roll was greasy and nasty. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered my staple dish BBQ chicken , spring roll with vermicelli.    Verdict, the food was mediocre.  BBQ chicken was obviously reheated, the chopped peanut as garnishes were huge pieces, and the spring roll was tasteless. The vermicelli noodles were fine,  though, I hadn't run into a place that messes the noodles up.   My eyes hurt with all the cheap florescent lighting in here.  They share the washrooms with the club next door. Weird.   I've had better, but if you're craving Viet food late (place is open until 4am) well here's a spot."}
{"text":"Good quality Pho. One of the best in Richmond Hill.  The broth was nicely flavored and not greasy. I ordered the flank brisket with tendon and they gave a lot of tendon.  A little bit on the pricier side.  Large is 8.95 and Small is 6.95 but I would come back. The pork summer rolls were yummy!"}
{"text":"I got the Chicken and Spring Roll Vermicelli.  Prices are affordable but the cost of this was slightly more than the other two Kim Po locations that I've been to.  Food was delicious.  Better than the Kim Po on Steeles and Middlefield.  Although the seating environment is spacious, I don't really like the dark lighting.  Just wish the lighting was brighter.  Cleaner environment than the Kim Po on Redlea.    Overall, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"The food was average, but service was pretty bad and the tables didn't seem to be wiped down properly."}
{"text":"My go to Vietnamese restaurant in the area. Decent food, decent prices and a spacious place. I usually get their grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli but their pho is also quite good and sizeable.  Their specialty drinks aren't that good though. You may as well go across the parking lot to Richmond Court for that."}
{"text":"After eating and having paid the bill, I got up and saw a cockroach on one of the booth seats. I told a waitress. She said \"oh\", killed it and went on like nothing happened. Never comming back. It was winter when this happened so no way that roach came from the street."}
{"text":"Been here twice.   This is a restaurant located on Hwy 7 with decent food for a good price.   The pho broth was full of flavours.  I ordered beef tripe on the side for extra $2.00, but so small amount came.. it was disappointing.  I like their pho menu option because it is so simple to order. You just pick the size of the bowl and topping whatever you like! I picked everything.  Btw, server was not nice. She looked angry I donno why."}
{"text":"Decent food, rising prices, poor customer service - no reason to come back here for me.  My latest trip to Kim Po was extremely poor with the staff being rude and unhappy, we would make requests and they would basically deny them and walk away.  They screwed up our order and were rude about it.  There's a much better Pho place in the same plaza, \""}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Don't go! The basil is not fresh (looks like garbage), we asked the server to change it. He says they got it in the morning, so it suppose to be like that at dinner time. There are flies flying around. They add a tip to the bill, when they provide no service. We should've left the minute we got there. Only if I could give no star, I would give it."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that you can usually get a pretty cheap lunch in a pretty short amount of the time, although there has been occasion where we have had to wait significantly longer. The thing about this place is that the pho is usually consistent in quality and not too shabby if you're looking for a quick fill up. Lunch comes with a spring roll and hot beverage (e.g. milk tea or lemon tea)."}
{"text":"Horrible staff, they are rude and they throw things on the table. They give you that shit look on the face too. Despite of the rudeness, I gave them a 10% tips. And they said it's not enough and asked for more."}
{"text":"The sate beef noodle soup with peanut in this location is the absolute best. Better than the other location and definitely better than any other pho place that makes this bowl. Ive had it so many times to the point where i dont need to say anything when i walk in the door because they already know what to make when they see me. The Staff are very nice people. The only thing that prevents me from rating it a full 5 stars...is that they close way too early every day at 5pm. So if u arrive any time after 420pm or 430pm, you may not be able to get service. Come early for this delicious food."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by this place. I am a big fan of their downtown location on Dundas near Spadina Kim Bo, so I figured the food would be similar because the owners are related but this place really disappointed me. Rice was over cooked or old, (hard and dry) noodle soup was lacking flavor tasted a lil watered down or missing something. On the plus service is fast, and portions were big but as for taste it's a fail. So one star for speed, one for size, minus one for taste."}
{"text":"The pho here is mediocre.  The broth is lukewarm and will only a few slices of beef.  I really do remember it being a lot better.  I really think it's going down hill.  However I had the Vietnamese coffee here and it was pretty good.  Overall I would only come here out of convenience for others.  There are definitely better pho restaurants that you can find around town."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is pretty good, vermicelli is really bad wih blend taste. pho is mediocre. Does not take credit cards, cash or debit only"}
{"text":"I have been here 7 times.  The pho here is decent but the soup base is not as tasty as other places I have been.  Portion size is good.  I noticed they finally changed the ugly decor they had before. (yes I haven't been here for a long time).  This place is consider clean for a Pho place and seating is more comfortable as well."}
{"text":"3.5 This is me and my boyfriends go to restaurant for pho in Richmond hill.  Service is weak. Servers are uninterested but the food is good which is why we come.  My boyfriend gets a large house pho and I usually get a rice dish with chicken, fried egg, and egg cake.  Their spring rolls are bomb. But the price keeps going up. I think it's now like 6.50 for two rolls? That's a lot. But it is pretty darn good.  Curry with roti is good too.   Cash or debit only. No credit card so don't come here looking to collect air miles."}
{"text":"The food here is good, however sometimes you can taste the chlorine after they wash their plates/cups.   The service is always really fast although not always accurate. The fast service makes this a great spot is you're in a rush during lunch."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is by far my favourite go to place for pho because its cheap and tasty !! $7.99 for a combo that comes with a drink , spring rolls and a large bowl of pho !   I agree that maybe the servers seems to be always a bit unhappy all the time but they haven't done anything against me to make me dislike them enough to not come.. Overall this is best pho and price in Richmond hill/Markham in my eyes and most importantly tastebuds !!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews and I barely give bad ratings.  Food was average, utensils smells like bleach, and service was terrible. I guess they were mad that we were the last table to leave. When I asked for the bill, she did not respond but gave me this rude look.  Perhaps we did not give as much tip as she wanted, because started rummaging through our bills and coins while we were still sitting at the table (I guess to see how much we tipped) and gave a huge sigh. She then proceeded to complain about us in Chinese to her coworker about how we tipped her so little... I can understand Chinese... My friend left another dollar because she felt bad but I wish I took it back. They don't deserve it at all.  I've been reading other comments and it seems like reaching in and counting tips is a common theme at this place."}
{"text":"Very good pho and food, bur sadly, this location is CLOSED!"}
{"text":"Kim po is a franchise, so all are a little different. This one isn't as good as the steels and Kenndy one but not as bad as the woodbine one (if that's even still there) I didn't like how they only had two sizes and the shape of the bowls, but for a quick pho it did the job and wasn't too expensive( not cheap ether)"}
{"text":"Did this place change owners recently?  Been many times before and the pho was decent.  Haven't been in about 6 months and had pho today and it was the worst pho I've ever had.  The noodles were different from before - really thick rice noodles.  I prefer the thinner ones.  The beef was more fat than beef.  And the pieces that weren't fatty tasted kind of sour like it was old.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for forever.. Definitely my go-to restaurant if I'm craving for Pho.  The times when I'm not feeling too hot or the times where I need to cure a hangover.. You know what I'm talking about!  I am very particular with the taste of the broth and the type of noodles that are served in Pho and I must say that this place is my all time favourite so far.  It's close to home and I'm always afraid to try different places cause I've been disappointed a couple times.  The service is definitely not the best but they are definitely quick with serving the food.  The portion size is pretty decent for the price that you pay, although I believe as of recently they did up their prices a little.  Regardless, I'm sticking to what I know and what I like, and that's that!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with pho. It's just some raw meat, noodles and that's it. The most important part, in my opinion , is the soup base. This place really lives up to it. The soup was delicious and the noodles were awesome. Everyone finished everything.  So why the 3 star? The biggest problem was the service. They had a button to call the waiter, but they don't always answer. Then they forgot part of our order and we had to order it again. The speed was ok. It may have been busy so that is why the forgot.  Also ordered the satay noodles. Now this was a little too oily. I had to scoop some of the oil out to drink the soup base.  Pro  Awesome noodles Good price Decent environment  Con  Forgot order Oily satay soup base"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Its good for those days where you just want to eat something fast and cheap. I recommend the summer rolls! I love them and always get the Viet coffee! Yum!!   I've been here for a couple of years now. This is still def. my fav for PHO."}
{"text":"I just realiZed i left a review for this place like 3 years ago, & I started a job at hwy 7 & leslie so Ive been trying all these asian places again..   I think this place has fantastic tasting food. If you go during busy lunch hours, the service is pretty slow but  the food, and the amount you pay for the portion you get is just great.   I normally get the lemongrass pork chops and rice with a fried egg.. SO GOOD.   & yesterday I decided to try one of these bowls of red noodle soups i see everyone eating everytime i come. I think it was called the satay beef noodle soup.. SO GOOD. & i got the small, and it was more than enough for TWO people.  I dont know how some girls eat a large of that all on their own...    Im def going here for my lunch break more often"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 4 star only for the beef 7 dishes, it's the only dishes that are good.  We've tried quite a number of their noodle soups and they are not good.    We still go back here only for the beef 7 dish!  Sit away from the window and entrance door area in the winter as it's so cold there maybe the heat is not well circulated in that area."}
{"text":"Located in a dying plaza (imo); packed when the bar next door was still called Platform2.  Few tables filled on a weekday at 7pm. Ordered a Brisket Tendon Pho noodle in a size \"small\", but it's larger in portion than its rival, and they didn't cheap out on the tendon/meat either.  Also tried their Lemon Grass Chicken on rice, which was decently sized, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Egg on the side was a nice bonus.  Wanted a 3-colour-ice drink, however they ran out of red been to make it, which I thought was odd. This drink is a Vietnamese restaurant classic. So instead I opted for an avocado shake (favourite of mine at Pho88), that was filled into a beer cup! Beer cup = big portion! It was nice and creamy.  Would defiantly repeat. But given the slow business in the plaza, hopefully they'll be around still."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant today, and the pho is definitely not good, me and my bf got large beef pho and saigon fried rice, the pho had no flavour. The pho broth tastes like boiled starch water and the fried rice tastes like ketchup only. We took a few bites and left right away and chinese server demanded a tip before we even took our wallet to pay"}
{"text":"Great portion size, mediocre curry, good skewers, terrible service. Also, really strange tasting water.  Came Sunday with a group of eight around 3 pm. It was pretty empty (and had less than stellar reviews), which should've been a warning sign... Alas, group decisions.  The shrimp and tomato pho has in fact pork. We figured this out after it was ordered and came out. This is obviously no good for pescatarian.  The problem was the server literally required about four prompts to confirm there was actually meat in it, got confused about it, and finally said \"oohh that's just how it is.\"  Awful.  Curry chicken was fairly watered down and unfortunately had bone in. Some parts were tender but others were dry - seems unevenly cooked.  On the bright side, the skewers are actually pretty darn good. Juicy and tender.  Problem is, bad service sometimes overwhelms decent flavour. And the curry was bleh to begin with.  I think the porkchops and satay were good based on others at the table, so if I ever deigned to come back, I suppose that's what I'd try."}
{"text":"After we drove to the other location next to this bar, we found this location by random (thanks to my trusty yelp app). I've been to the Kennedy & Steeles location which is my favourite pho place. This location is on par with the other one, only difference is that this one is better due to the fact that they offer specials! We both ordered a small house special beef pho which includes a spring roll all for 7.95+tax, you also have the choice to add a drink for $1.00. The portion was generous for a small and spring rolls were same as the other location...delicious and crispy. It was quite empty when we went and the service was prompt. I'll be coming back if I end up in the area."}
{"text":"KIM PO IS ACTUAL GARBAGE. The service was honestly the worst I have ever received. Went there as a group and was forced to pay 1 bill, they treated us as criminals or something . After we tipped the server said \"that's all for tip?\" she was such a rude lady. I am so happy this place shut down because it had consistent trash service !"}
{"text":"Mmm..YUMMY MUMMY!  This review is based solely on their noodle soup (pho) and their fried spring rolls.  This is seriously good stuff.  First off, their noodle soup base is extremely flavourful.  There is just this great intense beefiness to it that I can't hardly describe.  Then the spring rolls have a wonderful crunch to it, without being too oily.  Their rolls contain enough taro in it so that you can smell the aromas.  Aside from the house special pho which contains everything (tripe, tendon, etc.), I also really enjoy their spicy seafood noodle soup.  HUGE portions at the right price!!!  I used to work down the street from here and made a visit at least once a week if not twice!!    Service is great!  Fast and friendly.  Lots of specials always posted (look for the crab...never had it but looks awesome!)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Kim Po for years. The food has always been decently priced. The service has always been adequate. Too bad I can't say the same about it anymore.   It's unfortunate that the restaurant has gone downhill. The servers are now rude and incompetent! The server that we had took a while to come to our table and ended up messing up my uncle's order. She barely spoke while serving us (no, it was not a language barrier - we heard her chatting away in Cantonese (my family speaks Cantonese) to another server as we were deciding on what to order). When we told her that the order was messed up, she rolled her eyes and started clearing up my cousin's dish while he was still eating it (my cousin later told me that his vermicelli was not cooked properly)! Needless to say, we were pretty upset about the whole ordeal and we ended up going to the Pho Hoa nearby.   When we came back again to give this place another chance, we were once again, given very poor service. We were not greeted when we walked in and we actually had to walk up to a server to ask to get seated. When we looked at the menu, we saw that the prices were all jacked up from the last time we were there. We decided that this was the last straw and we ended up leaving immediately.   I will not be coming back again, not after the subpar service and poorly cooked food."}
{"text":"A $7.95 lunch special with a bucket of Pho ( glad I didn't order the \"large\") and a couple of the best spring rolls I have ever tasted! I haven't been here in about 8 years, and it looks exactly the same, but it is still a really decent place for lunch."}
{"text":"Out of the few PHO places that closes 4 am Monday to Sunday!  The place is clean, and the ambiance and decor matches the restaurant's theme.  As a surprise the owner of the pub next door also owns this PHO restaurant I was told.   I decided to order the chicken pad thai noodles, and out of 5, it was more like 3/5.  The texture, and flavor was satisfying, but I found it not as zesty, nor sweet as I was expecting.  The chicken however was very flavorful with the lemon grass outer layer.   My brother's PHO noodles were quite salted, and he's not the one to complain.  He had been there the past couple of times, however the chef may have put too much salt in it.  Overall experience was nothing special, would I come here, probably not."}
{"text":"This is my least favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill... I mean in the GTA... I mean in Canada??  I'll start with what some people may feel are the good things about this place.  - They have a button on every table which calls for service. Not sure why they need this, because I can't imagine them being busy enough to need this feature.  - You choose each component that'll be in your pho off a list of ingredients (is this really necessary?) - lots of free parking in the plaza  That being said, the food really wasn't that good. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Usually I am not too picky as well as would never usually give a one star......but this was just too much. I ordered a make it yourself pho with tripe and beef balls.  Usually this is the part where I am supposed to comment on how great the soup tasted and the thickness of the noodle, but in the end what I got rewarded with was 2 beef balls and like what felt to me like half a dollar worth of tripe.  If you don't believe me take a look at my pictures and you will see how bad the portions was.  My gf got pretty good portions, but I felt like maybe they thought I was getting too fat and telling me I should eat less (my jab at sarcasm) on a serious note, service was crap, soup was alright, meat was non existent and just do not come visit.  Money well wasted"}
{"text":"This place honestly does not even deserve that one star. I've been to the Kim Po locations downtown on Spadina as well as the one near Pacific Mall, and they are so much better. I know they're different because they don't have the same owners but we were curious to try. What a mistake.   We came around 9:15 PM, and there were only 2 tables of diners at the time. When we asked if we could sit in the booth seats by the window, because we were a party of 4, both the ladies gave us a annoyed look. When we were seated, they practically threw the menus on the table. We asked if the had the Fuk Kien Noodles, which are our go-to items on the menu at it get Kim Po locations, and on e of the ladies rolled her eyes and grabbed the menu out of our hands and pointed it to us.  Some of us had the Fuk Kien Noodles, and a bowl of Pho. MSG GALORE. The broth was way too sweet and so full of msg, we kept drinking the tea. The noodles were hard and the meats were okay, but the broth was just really unacceptable. During our meal, the two ladies just stood there by the kitchen, arms crossed, staring us down.   At the end, our bill came to a total of $36.49, and we still left $40, even for the terrible service we had encountered through the entire meal. On our way out the door, one the ladies practically yelled at us and stopped us and said that the bill did not include the tips. My dad left another $1 and she gave us a look and said again the bill does not include tips in such an angry tone, we took the $1 back. Absolutely terrible. I can understand the low ratings, and the lack of customers here, they totally do not know how to treat their customers right! People have bad days and I totally understand, but from reading other reviews, it seems to me, we weren't the only ones who received such bad service. Their management needs to step up their game, especially if they are not treating their employees right, if this is the reason why they're so rude."}
{"text":"Decided to have a lunch date with my boyfriend since the office gives you an hour lunch. We were craving some pho (though we didn't end up ordering it) so we stopped by here. Parking is a nightmare, but just be patient and try the camping technique haha!  The staff here are not the best. Didn't answer any of our questions about the menu and were extremely impatient. They weren't even busy, which is what annoyed me about their attitude.   I got the vermicelli and you get to choose two toppings. I had shredded pork and the sugar cane shrimp. Neither were very good, but they didn't taste horrible or anything. I just added the fish sauce and some chili to make it a bit more palatable. They really lack any flavour in that dish. My boyfriend tried the curry beef brisket with a side of rice. The curry was a good portion size and flavour was okay. Again, nothing really special.  Service, while rude, is quick, so we easily had time to spare for our lunch hour. Food arrived really quick in good portions. Decently priced. It's a nice spot if you're looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Usually come here when I'm craving for pad Thai but I guess we have to pick another place next time.   Their food isn't bad but the utensils always smell like bleach.  tonight as usual ordered a large rare beef and and pad Thai Bf found a tiny piece of plastic in his rare beef when he's half way through. Didn't say anything since it's not like a bug or hair. Pad Thai was a bit oily and can tell that they cut on the shrimp and chicken.  when we got the bill this lady just stood next to us the whole time while I'm going through my purse tomaking sure we tip enough  I ended up not giving the full amount but was close because we were not totally satisfied  then she counted the change and repeated the total to me, implying I haven't tipped enough  Meanwhile in the kitchen there was this big fight sounds like a staff wasn't happy with another staff saying she's stupid or something.  Anyway, u shouldn't feel entitled to a tip when u can't offer a quality meal or even manage ur staff"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is mediocre and could be better. However, the staff were extremely discourteous and impolite. As I was paying for the bill, the waitress would monitor me as I was bringing out my money. The total bill came to $30.90 and I left a $3.00 tip as we were not totally satisfied with our meal. After I was done paying, the waitress immediately counted the money in front of me and intended for me to pay the full 10%. This striked me as a surprise as I have never experienced this before. I found this tremendously rude as tips are optional and not obligatory. Would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"They changed the decor...probably a while back since I haven't been there for a while.  They had a special on the Laksa...got the Large, and it was LARGE!  So for $8.50, it was a great deal.  The soup was flavourful, but was a bit thin, but it was good regardless. The pricing is decent, not the cheapest around, but also not expensive at all.  You can't really compare prices with Richmond Court or anything at that level, but it's on par with other Vietnamese places in Times Square like Top Saigon.  I would definitely return.  Service was quick, food was good, and the decor was quite clean."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to pho place. After several visits with poor service and charging me for a take out box, I no longer go there. I prefer Nam at Leslie and 16th, Little Saigon at Yonge and Weldrick, or Mr Pho which recently opened."}
{"text":"This is definitely my \"go-to\" pho restaurant! Love how everything here is very fresh, and there's quite a good variety of food, even though I always just order the rare beef soup noodles and spring rolls. The soup is very tasty and the noodles are chewy just the way I like it.  Will definitely go here if I was craving for a good bowl of pho."}
{"text":"I had been going to Kim Po regularly over the years. Business had declined and as of April 15  2018 they are closed permanently after 20 years in business. The food was fair but quick."}
{"text":"Curry has undissolved chunks of potato starch in it, and service was sub-par.  What ticked us off was the bad mannered waitress demanded for more tips when her service was minimal - eg. not bothered to give the food to the proper person when the dish itself is super heavy."}
{"text":"Came here for some Vietnamese pho the other day.  Saw the open till 4am sign outside and thought it would be worth checking out.  I heard it's owned by the same owner as the bar next door, which is why it's open till 4am to accommodate the late night customers.  Ordered the house special beef noodle soup  (S $6.75, L $7.95).  Soup stock and beef was fairly good ... noodles were the thick noodle kind.  Service was good, restaurant was pretty clean and spacious.  Would recommend to anyone looking for late night pho in the area."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch special vermicelli with 3 chicken skewers and spring roll for $8.50 - comes with egg drop soup. Portions of meat and noodles were filling. Meat was seasoned and grilled well. The spring roll had an amazing crispy shell. Everything tasted excellent.  Also got a chance to try the lemon chicken vermicelli $8.95. Tasted similar to the chicken skewers.  Avocado milk shake $3.45 - Not much avocado flavour. Tasted like a sweet milky vanilla shake. I still liked it though.  Also got a fried rice to go at $11.95  Service was fast, prices are affordable and the place was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Bad experience and service left a bad taste in my mouth.   The food served is on par with many Vietnamese noodle soup restaurants in the area, with adequate portions of meat and noodles. The soup base, while nothing to phone home about, is enough to satisfy most pho cravings and is not overly salty or bland.   However our experience there was fouled with bad service. The waitress felt no need to check on our table for tea refills, and did not once attempt to clear our long-finished dishes from the table. At the end of our stay, she expected a large tip, rudely demanding money until the 10% (that was not deserved in the slightest) was paid. We angrily put down our money and left, not willing to come back to this entitled excuse for a good restaurant.   I suggest that anybody looking for a positive experience take their money elsewhere, unless you are an acquaintance of the waitresses and owners. While the food was decent, the attitude given to my group more than outweighed the quality of the food. 2/10."}
{"text":"Bad service, Bad Service, BAD SERVICE! NEVER HAD SERVICE THIS HORRIBLE at a PHO restaurant IN. My. LIFE!  Lucky us we got a server who was in a funky mood. We were moved twice. The \"green tea\" was more like a lukewarm water pot that they probably had sitting there for a while. The \"server\" kept us waiting while people who got after us got their food before she even came around, was very rude and could not understand a word of English.  Then after a good long wait, she brought us the mint etc. for the PHO and nearly spilled the soup on one member of the party, thankfully most of fell on the table (which she didn't bother to clean up). Then she gave the mint which she had tried to stop from falling by her elbow to the customers sitting behind us.   She brought another soup and gave it to the wrong person, and since she couldn't speak (or was willing to speak) a word of english, she didn't mention whose order it was for.   Food arrived late, and the cold teapot just sat there with the lid turned over. She finally slammed the lid close and took it and never brought any tea back. We had to ask someone else to bring us the tea. The tea that we were supposed to get with our specials never arrived until we were done with the food. Then another server came around and without asking anyone, just took our \"hot\" tea and replaced it with another pot. WHAT . THE. HELL????  The Pho was actually ok, but the way the service was happening and the way we totally got bad service makes me wonder what's going on in the kitchen.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE.   I wish we had gone to the other other Pho place that my Vietnamese friends took me to. It's a hole in the wall but their service is waaaay better and the food is pretty damn good.  Caveat Emptor!!!  NOTE: Please note I mistakenly wrote this review for the one on Don Mills. This is about the Hwy 7 location in Thornhill we went there 3/16/2012 :"}
{"text":"3-stars is about right for the Richmond Hill Kim Po branch.  This branch was actually what got me hooked onto Kim Po. I used to frequent here, as I didn't wanna go all the way downtown for the Kim restaurant there. When the Scarborough branch opened I pretty much exclusively went there, as the food I find is much better there. Nevertheless I would still visit here occasionally if I'm running some errands by Times Square.  Back then I used to pretty much exclusively order the seafood noodle soup. They do it very well, aside from the fact the noodle quantity was always low. Nowadays they increased the bowl size and noodle quantity. The last time I visited I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup, which has a very delicious tomato soup base. They use the regular pho for the non-pho bowls as well...which I guess is dependent on whether you like it or not (I don't; I prefer the regular noodles). Overall it tasted okay, nothing to get crazy or to complain about.  Service varied in the several times I was there. It really depends on whoever is serving that day, as I've had ones who were very attentive and I had others who would forcefully put down the bowls, chopsticks, etc. and never say thank you of any sort."}
{"text":"nice place, quite decent for Pho place.  the noodle was done quite nice, I ordered a small portion, but it still too much noodle vs the actual meat. so I added with the house platter. now that is a nice combo. the mix + noodle, yum... my friend ordered the sate sauce version. he said it was nice too. I saw my next table ordered a big size portion, OMG, its huge.. for the price, can't go wrong with the small portion. but don't just order the noodle, you have to add stuff (side orders of lemongrass beef, or something like that). otherwise the food is just too much noodles."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here for a long time and I'm glad because I don't think I will be returning any time soon. I came here for lunch and was delighted that there was lunch deals on Mon- Fri that comes with either Milk Tea or Lemon Water. Despite the portion being bigger than I had expected and my beef brisket noodles in tomato broth being quite tasty, I was thorough unimpressed in other aspects. The dishes and utensils we were using to eat were dirty. On top of that, the waiter serving us was very rude. When we asked politely to order, he made it seem like we were bothering him. I also witnessed the same waiter cut the leaves served on side of pho outside on a dining table. I am not sure how sanitary that is. Overall, food is okay but the whole experience was distasteful."}
{"text":"This location is a lot better than the Richmond location. The food comes out piping hot and fresh and delicious. It's always busy and the workers here speak both Vietnamese and Chinese, and you can tell they are more authentic than the highway 7'location."}
{"text":"I've tried both locations. This one and the Markham one in front of pmall. I personally think the quality at the pmall one is a lot better. I don't think they are owned by the same people because the one at pmall seems more of a family restaurant whereas the one in Richmond hill makes it really evident that it's just a chain. The pmall one is also always busy & I can't say the same for the Richmond one. The Richmond one is bigger and it's opened for longer hours than the pmall one however the quality of the food was not there. The first time I tried Kim po was at the Markham location and it was really delicious. Food came out piping hot and portions were fair. The portions at the Richmond one are a lot less and seems less authentic and fresh. I will be returning to the Markham location but unfortunately not back to the Richmond location."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night.  When we walked in the atmosphere was kind of dull and not busy.  Some man was eating and told us where to sit.  Our soup was ok, although I don't understand why there was pineapple and tomatoes in mine.  The server was not nice and abrupt.  You would think that was the problem, but nope.  I was so disgusted when I look over at the next table and the waitress is sitting down and flossing her teeth.  I will never ever go back there.  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Pros: You choose what goes in your Pho  Cons: Sides are pretty pricey here  There are tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants with the name Kim Po. I don't know if they're all linked together or they just use the same name.  This one is your standard Pho restaurant.   Not amazing, but not bad either.  The one thing I like about this place is you choose exactly what you want in your Pho.  Most Pho places have predetermined bowls of Pho with what goes in it.  This place let's you pick which meats you want in it. I'm a fan of brisket but not always of what most places put with brisket in Pho places so that was a nice thing for me.     The Pho here is OK.  The broth was decent, it felt like it was missing something though.  Portions are pretty good for the price.  I usually like to order the deep fried spring rolls to go with my meal but they were like $7-8 here, yikes.  Another dollar or 2 and I have myself another bowl of Pho!!  Honestly, I came here because our original choice of Deer Garden was packed and the wait time would of been crazy.  It would take something like that again for me to come back as well.  Its still a decent place, don't get me wrong.  I just think there are better options for Pho."}
{"text":"The pho use to be really good here but now it's just gone downhill. Theres barely any flavor in the soup. The spring rolls are half decent. The service is terrible but I guess people go back here for the decent price they offer."}
{"text":"Very lackluster Pho! Soup not hot enough to unleash all the flavours of the meats and herbs. The Vietnamese coffee came on half the glass (why use a tall glass if you are leaving it at half?) Not recommended although the staff is helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Open till 4. Went at 12:40am and it was actually empty. Thought it would be filled with drunk people or soon to be drunk people.   The pho was actually decent. I am not sure about the other reviews but it seemed pretty good to me. The beef was served on the side as requested and decent quality too. The large was super big as well. I would probably give it a 4-4.5 but for all the negative reviews I'll give it a 5 since I think its worth a try.  It certainly surprised me. Apparently you can also order this at hangover as the places are linked."}
{"text":"Talking about going downhill... Kim Po Vietnamese Restaurant is doing a free fall...  I think I need to have a drink or 2 or 3 at the pub next door.. before I ever come in here to eat again... or maybe I should just starve??!!  All Day Specials seems to be great value with a free drink coffee/tea..  Curry Beef Brisket with Rice ($7.50) /milk tea - Rice still hard and cold...  - Curry lurk warm - Milk Tea is day old just add water and microwave..with no taste at all! - Maybe they just microwave everything a couple of minute more  Special Pho Large ($7.95) - Sizable.. too sizable especially when the broth is bland...  With just 2 tables to serve, our waitress was loud and gossipy... I don't want to listen to your life story..... I just want some peace and quiet while I eat my food!  Maybe I should just spend my money on drinks......."}
{"text":"Kim Po Vietnamese Restaurant has been around for over 10 years in Times Square up at Richmond Hill.  Recently they did a total renovation and they ripped out all those old decoration (faint European mosaic ceiling/french courtyard style decoration) and replaced with modern/chic/simple decoration. I do like the new look a lot better!!  I ordered the lunch special with House Special Pho (small), spring roll and a hot drink for $6.95.  The noodle arrive quickly served in this tall chic round bowel. (the bowel is so tall I felt like I am steaming my face.. and of course I smell like the broth after I finish eating :8 )  The noodle is the dried type but prepared properly without that funny taste in it. The broth is really clear and quite flavoured. Extra marks for the tendon, soft/melt in your mouth type! I usually hate eating tendon..and today I felt like having more!!!  Spring roll is the real vietnamese type! Nice fat spring rolls with the crunchy wrappings! The fish sauce is a little weak..too watered down though.  Lunch Specials all for $6.95 and seems to be really popular with the office people in the area! The service is quick and friendly!   They accepts Visa and MC for over $20 without 5% surcharges."}
{"text":"Kim Po is definitely not the best place for authentic pho in the area. But they just happen to have a dish that I REALLY like so, despite the poor service and not the cleanest interior, I still come back once in a while.  Their satay beef noodle soup ($8.95 for small $10.50? For large) is so good. If you have to eat here, I recommend you get it. It's spicy/peanuty and even after trying the same dish at every other Vietnamese place in Markham/Richmond Hill, it is still my favourite (if you try it and find a better one please let me know). They also have pretty huge spring rolls if you're looking for an appetizer.  Their service truly is bad, and since I only really like one thing there, I will probably stick to ordering my satay pho to go."}
{"text":"Its located in the quiet plaza on Woodbine.  The food here is not bad, but not super authentic authentic Vietnamese either. Lunch specials are good deals $9 for your choice of entrees and HK tea. We had pork chop on rice and vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring rolls. Portions were large; my vermicelli came with two large chicken skewers and one spring roll.  This is not a bad option if you're in the area but nothing to rave about"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waiter got the bills mixed up and start speaking cantonese to us even though nobody understands. Food is average too..."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to drop by Kim Po with my parents or a quick lunch before our day of errands.  Kim Po has undergone reno's for maybe the third time in the past 10 years.  With the latest being a much more sleek and cleaner feel to the restaurant.  I won't talk too much about the past but for loyal customers to this shop, the reno is definitely welcomed.  We took a look at the menu and not much has changed.  We ordered a spring roll appetizer, a large lemon grass chicken pho, a large rare beef pho and a beef with spring roll vermicelli.  Lunch was pretty busy and because of this the service suffered.  The wait was a little longer than expected at about 15 mins and the waitress forgot our bean sprouts 3 times with reminders.  Not impressed.  The service is usually quick and adequate, so this was a little downer for us.  When the food finally came with everything that we ordered, it remained consistent with our past experiences.  One thing to take note of is the lemon grass chicken usually comes in a plate on its own.  I personally prefer this.  I believe having the chicken dunked into the soup not only hurts the taste of the chicken but also the broth.  And the amount of chicken given is quite sufficient and is cooked quite well.  So definitely no complaints there.  The rare beef was a little bit better than average but nothing to write home about.  The vermicelli was considered a winner at the table.  Thought my personal belief, like the rare beef pho it's better than average but nothing spectacular.  Though I do have to say the spring rolls are usually cooked quite well and come out crispy.  And this is true whether you order it as an appetizer or with your entree.  So this might have been a factor in its crowning as the winner at the table.  Overall, I like Kim Po as I've been here a number of times.  And with the recently renos, it's a nice welcome.  The place is much neater and cleaner.  So for many of us clean freaks, it's important for a restaurant to hold these traits.  The food is consistent with what was offered in the past, so loyal customer will appreciate this.  There are some nice lunch specials on the weekdays, so it's not a horrible option.  And it's slightly above average, so you're not trading quality for price.  Kim Po's good enough to warrant another visit and be prepared to leave quite stuffed. =)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to for Vietnamese food in Richmond Hill! Great rice and pho.   The soup base for the pho is consistent, rich and delicious! Food comes quickly.  Great milk and lemon tea as well."}
{"text":"Quick service. Not a fancy place but small family run Pho place. Spring rolls are awesome. Possibly one of the best pho in markham. Will definitely come back for sure."}
{"text":"After I received my change from paying for my meal the waitress just stood beside me, looking over my shoulder and made sure I tipped enough. She even reached and started counting coins while I was still in the middle of giving her tips. Extremely disrespectful staff. I have never been to an establishment where the staff physically counted the tips for you. This restaurant lost all my business. Would not come back again. I'm sure you can see that other people have had the same issue as me if you read some of the other reviews. 1/5 stars."}
