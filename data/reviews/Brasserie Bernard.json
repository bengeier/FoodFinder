{"text":"Where to start. Well joined my friends, where their table was full so we, ( a friend and I )sat right next to their table and some people from the big table came and joined to chat. Waitress being incompetent and bad mannered came to one of the ladies sitting in the large table and spoke rudely to my friend. All this to say she was incompetent and rude. Manager being also stupid putting customer last decided to take the waitress side and lost a table of 12 ppl......."}
{"text":"The most flaky service. Some days they're right on top of things and other days the waiters just walk right by you way after you're seated without even filling your glass of water. There is a serious problem with the way this restaurant is run. It is a shame because my husband and I live right across the street and we love their brunches. But I would be nervous inviting people here or even recommending it..."}
{"text":"Recently went to Brasserie Bernard for dinner with a friend. Food was good, service was on point. I had mussels, warning - the portion is huge and yummy! Great neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais été folle des brasseries françaises puisque trop classiques et semblables, mais je souhaitais quand même lui donner sa chance. J'ai aimé l'ambiance et le décor qui nous rappelle les cafés de Paris. Le service était assez, voir très, lent toutefois, il a fallu demander de l'eau 3x et attendre un bon moment pour finalement commander et ce malgré le départ de plusieurs tables et l'heure. Idem pour le pain. On s'est fait servir par 3 personnes différentes! Pour la bouffe c'était bien, on a pris les pâtes aux crevettes à l'ail et la raie en plus d'une entrée. Les mélanges de saveurs étaient réussis et la portion répond à notre faim. Si vous aimez les brasseries françaises vous retrouverez sur la carte tous les classiques habituels. Détail important, j'ai été très malade pendant la nuit, je ne suis pas certaine si c'était l'aile de raie qui sentait si fort que même la serveuse semblait douter de la fraîcheur, mais il a dû avoir quelque chose qui m'a fait réagir ainsi. Dommage."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and likely my last. I was so disappointed in the food quality and service. I treated a friend to the table d'hote and was horrified that she received a burnt  puck of beef after waiting an unreasonable amount of time. The fact the server did not even acknowledge the poor quality/presentation and never asked if we enjoyed the meal, reflects the nonchalance attitude of this place. I am a firm  believer that a sever is the representative of the food and the establishment. And when they don't take ownership of the experience, there's no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Nice place, a lot of room on the terrace. Shared a few drinks with two friends watching the people walking by Bernard street.  I wouldn't make a detour for this place, but I also have nothing negative to say about it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a Saturday. Great outdoor seating along a lovely street. I got the french toast with caramelized banana and my boyfriend got the the Mediterranean casserole. We were both happy with our choices. The french toast, while very sweet, was delicious and cakey. The carmel sauce was perfect and smooth. The Mediterranean casserole came with spicy sausage, egg, vegetables, a salad and bread and jam. We also were given a complimentary cinnamon raisin bread to start, which seemed to be standard at each table. Very friendly staff, clean restrooms. An overall great experience."}
{"text":"Deux mots pour résumer ma visite à la Brasserie Bernard : soirée parfaite. 

En tant que personne coeliaque, je suis toujours très hésitante à aller manger dans les restaurants. Mais je dois dire que le merveilleux personnel de la Brasserie m'a rapidement faite sentir en sécurité! Notre serveur connaissait bien le menu et savait ce qui était sécuritaire pour moi. Il y avait plusieurs options pour moi sur le menu, tellement que pour une fois, je me sentais tout à fait \"normale\" malgré ma maladie. Le rêve! 

L'entrée de pieuvre, l'onglet de boeuf et la crème brûlée, sans parler de la merveilleuse carte de vins, TOUT était excellent. L'ambiance aussi : hyper chaleureuse. J'aurais voulu y passer des heures et des heures.

On y retourne? Assssurément!"}
{"text":"Cuisine de bistro française classique mais réinventée. Un de mes restos favoris a montréal et je suis exigeant! 

Prendre l'aubergine gratinée ou le boudin noir en entrée. Le foie de veau en plat principal est top.

Belles grandes terrasses ajoutent a la qualité de la bouffe et du service impecable! Prix raisonnable pour la qualité. Clientèle chic d'outremont. La rapidité du service peut souffrir un peu les soirs tres occupés. Y aller un soir de semaine ou essayer le bruch le weekend. J'ai été un peu décu lors de mon dernier brunch.. Auraient-ils changer leur chef??"}
{"text":"First time I've been there for brunch. The location is great. Beautiful inside and in the summer it's great because all the windows open. For brunch I had a braised beef omelette. The service was terrific, the food was terrific. The portions are a bit small, but of great quality."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place for gatherings with friends. It's easy to find parking in nearby streets. The food is great and the atmosphere is fun. I usually get the gravlax, and am always more than satisfied. My friend always gets the eggs Benedict. Definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé,donc je critique sévère.a midi.beau cadre neuf bien patiné,clientèle plus jeune qu'au cinema en face.petite table d'hôte et long menu de plats modernes(pas fusion).carte des vins fournie,mais comme le classement est par prix on a besoin d'un sommelier pour le choix...le service est lent-petite brigade?mais comme le cadre est beau et le personnel aimable c'est pas trop dérangeant.le niveau sonore est à l'image de la modernité:difficilement supportable.ce qu'il y a dans l'assiette :saveurs,cuissons,présentation,accords tout est sans reproche.
Bel ajout sur bernard."}
{"text":"This is place is one my favorites. It's a cozy place with a french touch. You can go there with a date or a good friend to gossip. It's in the Outremont neighborhood, which is chic and classy.
The waiters are very nice and polite, you feel their long training which rare in Montréal!
I love their crispy bread with a touch of butter, that they serve before food. I ask for a pint of draft Grolsch beer. Also, I don't read the menu, since I always choose the same dishes: I start with a dozen of oysters, then a grilled hanger steak with white wine and thyme shallots and fries, accompanied. It's simply delicious....."}
{"text":"The mussels are delicious. Very nice French vibe. Great service and delicious fries. Indoor and outdoor seating. Charming. Great recommendation from a local. Will be here often."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Great service. Nice terrasse. Very hospitable despite their \"snobby clientele.  Great for brunch. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 cause management doesn't have the courage to tell their clientele crying babies are a no no in such a place"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my aunt and I loved it! The food is very good! I would have given it five stars but the service wasn't the best. For example, the waiter filled my aunt's glass with water but didn't fully mine even though mine was empty and I was really thirsty. Also I practically had to chase after the waiter to order a second cocktail. 

So I started wit the gin aperol cocktail. I had smthg similar at mousso but less fancy looking. I'm starting to realize that gin n aperol is a great mix n should try to make it at home. I also had the jalapeno margarita. It wasn't too spicy. We shared the grilled octopus entree. It was very good but I wouldn't say it was the best I've had.  Then I had the duck confit as a main and my aunt had the classic salmon tartare and ordered fries. It was all very good. No complaints here. For dessert we had the fondant au chocolat.  If I can tear myself out of bed I will come back and try their brunch."}
{"text":"Restaurant français avec un menu typique, sans surprise. Nous avons pris deux entrées, soient les calmars frits et la salade de patate avec le hareng fumé. Les deux plats étaient délicieux, surtout la salade de patate! L'hareng fumé est l'ingrédient magique de ce plat, au lieu de retrouver le bacon traditionnel, il est remplacé par ce poisson ayant un goût légèrement salé. Nous avons adoré. Par la suite, les mets principaux ont été l'onglet de boeuf avec des frites et le ravioli au homard. L'onglet de boeuf laisse à désirer, surtout pour la présentation ordinaire. Nous avons été décu de ce plat, malgré que la cuisson était bel et bien saignante. Par contre, le ravioli était très goûteux. 

Le service était extrêmement rapide. L'ambiance est agréable un dimanche soir. On s'entendait parler! Il y encore quelques trucs à rectifier (ex. présentation des plats), mais il est clair que nous serions de retour!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal and my family's cousin we had a little family gathering at Brasserie Bernard.  I was a little worried by the 2 reviews on Yelp but our hosts had been to Brasserie Bernard previously and enjoyed their experience.
Brasserie Bernard is in in the Outremont section of Montreal. It was an easy 10-15 minute Uber ride from our hotel near Old Montreal. 

The restaurant is a beautiful French-inspired bistro. It really reminded me of Paris. It was a pleasant June evening and the windows were open and they had tables outside available.

The food we had on this night was excellent. The dishes our party of 6 chose were the Muscles, the Duck Confit, Beef Tartar and the Fried Calamari. The Duck Confit was excellent and the came with an arugula salad. The muscle dish was very big and the leek and cheddar broth was very tasty. The fries were good too. The calamari was crispy and tender.

We had a few great desserts but the standout was the Pudding chomeur with maple syrup, Wow that was good.

The service all night was great and the staff was very friendly, the meal for 6 people including taxes and tips with a few beers was around $USD195.00. This was reasonable for a restaurant of this quality and charm."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch. Looks very swank when you walk in, but due to the really high ceilings, the place is really loud even when it's not packed. They have a pretty nice terrasse as well, but it was far too cold to even attempt to eat out there.

There are quite a few wines by the glass which is nice, but the beer selection certainly wasn't the best. Lunch was pretty good, but nothing too special and the price tag was pretty high, even by Outremont standards (tiny appy and then fish & chips: 20$)

I'd come again, but next time I would go for the mussels I think as they looked a lot better than my very fried fish et frites."}
{"text":"I arrived at 10:30 and requested a table on Bernard for 5...I had reserved and they gave me a terrible table in back...I am not impress"}
