{"text":"The restaurant itself is  nice but the Hakka food is average. The portions are huge and taste good noting mind blowing. The waiter got our dish wrong and was giving us looks how we ordered this because that what he wrote on his pad. It's never too busy. Two dishes came to $20 not bad. Looking for better Hakka food in Richmond hill area. their gravy for fish, chicken or beef taste the same weird but just So you know."}
{"text":"I have not been to the other finch location so i cant compare to it, so instead i will compare it to the gold standard of hakka food, Yueh Tung on elizabeth street downtown.   Place looks nice, new and clean. High ceilings, nice decor. I went when it was not busy, around 11:00am. There was one dude there, and he told me there was some sort of big group at the back, and that my order will take a while. Wasnt too long though..  I got the chili chicken with steamed rice. Lunch special comes with a surprisingly good (but small) spring roll & bottle of water. Chili chicken itself was good, but just not at the level of Yueh Tung. Flavour was there, and color was good, but the texture wasnt quite right; it was too crispy, like it was over fried by a minute or two; it needs to be softer & more slimy; it was also a bit too spicy... I will try to tell them to tone down the  spice next time. But overall was still good.   I would give the place a 3.5 if i could. Its not a 4 though... I will try some other dishes first before i reconsider."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and pricing is very good unfortunately there isn't much taste in their noodle meals. The shrimp is amazing and the service is very good but on a quality standpoint its nothing special"}
{"text":"Their take-out menu states that white meat chicken is $2.00 extra, with an additional 25cent charge for \"extra spicy\". I placed my take out order and was advised that it was \"too busy\" for the chefs to cook the Chili Chicken with white meat. Sad..i walked out."}
{"text":"This place seems to be changing names and menu every couple of years. Before the last change (to Hakka) it was decent Thai restaurant, the food was good quality and the prices were fairly good for the location. Now, after the last name/menu change, the restaurant serves tasteless food at low prices. We went there twice and the last time I even had upset stomach. No more Hakka for me..."}
{"text":"Had their shrimp pakora, chili chicken, and manchurian noodle (beef). It was good. Can't get much around Vaughan so was glad this place opened. Will go back again.."}
{"text":"I had the general tso chicken. Not impressed at all. Very bland. No spice, taste or any flavor to this dish what so ever. I usually get chili chicken at Hakka restaurants but decided to get this dish for a change. No thanks. Not again. 11/26/14 update - decided to try this place again for lunch. Ordered the general tso chicken. Total rip off. More than half the carton was rice and the chicken was mostly hard batter. On top of it all, I tried to pay with debit and the women wanted to charge me a fee of .50cents. This applies to all orders under $10. I'm now absolutely sure, never again."}
{"text":"Found this place to be awful. Starting off with the staff, they are extremely rude and impatient. When I was there the place didn't look very tidy as well.   The food was not very tasty at all. I ordered crispy noodles and beef with black bean sauce. The beef and black bean sauce was so saucy that at first I thought they accidentally gave me soup.   When I was leaving and did not tip (because of the poor service and food) I was rudely questioned as to why I did not tip them.   Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant and frankly I do not think they're going to last very long if they continue to offer such poor quality customer service and food. There are other restaurants in the area which are much more deserving of business."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called 5 Asian Cuisine, but it has transitioned to Hakka No. 1.  After visiting the location on Finch, we gathered some local friends and headed to this place on Friday night. We should have gone to the Finch location. While part of the Hakka No. 1 chain, with the same menu, it's obvious that each location uses different recipes to make their food.  We ordered the chicken pekoras. They were the hit of the evening and the 6 of us ordered two orders of it (each order contains 10 perkoras). They were nicely seasoned and served with a sauce (didn't care for it). At the Finch location, they give you lemon wedges to squeeze over top of them...it adds a new flavour into the mix.   The rest of the meal was substandard. The rice, the chili chicken, the green beans, were all a wash out. No where near as flavourful as the Finch location.  Our waiter was obviously not familiar with the menu as when we placed our order, he kept looking at the menu and writing down the corresponding menu number. The food came out oddly....we ordered 2 orders of chili chicken and they came out 15 minutes apart.....not sure why.  The only thing this place has over the Finch location is that the decor is much nicer. The Finch location also has hot peppers as well as hot sauce on the table...this location does not. We asked for some hot sauce and what we got had 0 heat to it.  Most likely will give this place another chance in a few months as they just changed over to Hakka No. 1 so they still might be working out some kinks."}
{"text":"We love Hakka so I was excited to see this restaurant opening up in my neighborhood.  The menu selection is huge!  The current special is a $5 an additional menu selection for any order over $20.  Each main course includes steamed rice.      We decided to try this place out and ordered take-out yesterday.  The menu gives you the option of choosing most dishes \"dry\" or in sauce (they call it \"gravy\").  We tried the dry spicy crispy beef, the Manchurian tiger prawns (in \"gravy\") and the chili chicken (also in \"gravy\").  The latter two were delicious with the right amount of spice in each.  The portion sizes were quite generous as well.  The crispy beef, however, was a huge disappointment.  It was neither crispy or spicy.   Despite this, I will go back and perhaps try the crispy ginger beef in light sauce and ask for it to be made extra spicy (although I think it is cheesy for them to charge an extra 25 cents for extra spicy upon request).  Three dishes with rice came to $28.25 so it was definitely a good value."}
