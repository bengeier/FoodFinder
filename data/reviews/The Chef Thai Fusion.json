{"text":"For starters the decor is pretty 'zen' soothing. Although in a modern strip type space, it is artfully decorated and has a nice mellow ambiance. To keep with this feel they use some asymmetrical dishes to present their offerings.  Last night we had a single soup which we shared. It was the Thai Lemon Soup and it was delicious. It featured a nicely clarified broth, mushrooms, chicken slices, bits of pineapple and a nice overall sweet taste with a spicy (not too spicy) finish.  We then shared 2 main course. The first one was the classical Pad  Thai. The noodles were delicious, the spicing right and the overall undertones of tamarind added to the deliciousness. A very good Pad Thai.  We also shared a plate of Eggplant which was the Sweet Chili  Eggplant, and it was delicious. I am a big fan of eggplant, and this was a perfect ending. With that we had a bowl of steamed jasmine rice.  A really great meal and all that for less than $30.00 for 2 (including taxes)!"}
{"text":"Used to come here quite often for lunch and I have to say I've never been disappointed.  Service is usually pretty attentive and portions are great for the price you're paying.  My personal favorite here is the Green Mango salad.  It's a very refreshing dish to have in the summer."}
{"text":"yeah decor was nice.  but the food was off the hook.  started with Tom Kha Gai soup. awesome. one little notch below the place in dallas my sister took me, but very close second to the best soup ever.  had the soft shell crab salad appetizer for dinner, being a huge soft shell fanatic.  it was served on a salad of green papaya, with a spicy chili dressing. i wanted to lick the bowl and devour the chopsticks it was THAT good.  in markham there are literally tons of thai, chinese, japanese, etc...restaurants; if back i will go to the chef thai fusion first."}
