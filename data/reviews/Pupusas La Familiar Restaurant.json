{"text":"Extremely bad service:
WARNING!!! Do NOT eat here!
Even though the service and food here were both below average, the worst has nothing to do with their bad food/service, but business ethics (the thing that keeps businesses from cheating their customers).
This restaurant, my dear reader, has violated the key principle of doing business - they are cheaters:
They put a couple of sales promotions on yelp to lure you in and spend money, but when it is time to pay, the servers stare at the yelp page i hold in my hand and have the guts to say: \"sorry, we can not honor that...\"
Naturally, I asked: \"why not? You put it on your yelp page, so i think you should honor it.\"
This is the restaurant's response: \"sorry, but we haven't done that for a while now.\"
\"Not for anybody?\"
\"Yeah...not for anybody.\"
Well, that was the end of it.
End of conversation.
End of trust.

Do you want to help stop this cheating restaurant's dirty practices?
If yes, then please find your food elsewhere, in a better place, with way better ethics.
Thank you."}
{"text":"Took about 20 minutes to bring out the food for one, and when they brought out my boyfriend and his moms food they told me they had no more tortillas not sure why they didn't let us know earlier so I could have ordered something different but besides that the Foods not bad just the costumer service was terrible."}
{"text":"The wait is not worth it, the food took an hour to come, we had to ask 3 times before we got water.
The food (other than the pupusas) was subpar and after such a long wait I had expected it to be spectacular or at least good enough that it wanted to finish my whole plate. If you just want pupusas and have at 1 and a half hours to eat then it's good, but for a quick bite I don't recommend"}
{"text":"Food is awesome but you need to order half an hour in advance...slow service good prices good service..but extremely slow...and did I mention that they are slow?  Because they are slow."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. We ordered $36 worth of food last night. 
Asked and paid for a chicken quesadilla, the quesadilla had no chicken.
Ordered and paid for 7 pupusas, only got 6. Ordered and paid 3 revueltos and only got 2.
AND THE CABBAGE THAT COMES WITH THE PUPUSAS HAD A PIECE OF SOMEONES GLOVE IN IT!!! THE FINGER PART. 
We were all so disgusted. 
They didn't offer a refund, just offered us to drive back and pick up the food.
Will not return here and do not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"You know that the place is going to be amazing when they serve you complimentary freshly made, hot tortilla chips! I absolutely recommend their (#1) salvadorian plate! All the side dishes compliment each other. I also loved their chicken tamale and bean and cheese pupusas. It was full of flavor in each bite! It was a lot of food so I ended up taking some home to eat it later. Our food came quickly. Highly recommend it and will be back to try more food!"}
{"text":"This is my spot for Salvadorian food. The owner is great. Really makes you feel at home. I've tried a ton of places that sell pupusas and they always seems very oily or there's no cheese ect. But here you truly get your money's worth. This is not a fast food drive Thur they make your food fresh so keep that in mind. Overall, they have me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  We got here, All tables full.  After waiting to order,  the waitress said they were short staffed.  Come to find out,  one cook and the waitress.  We waited over 1 hour.  If you dine here, check the staffing.
I"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this restaurant. The lady behind counter greeted me with a kind smile and told me about the cuisine. I noticed the cook making the pupusas . I saw the love and care she took with every one. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very cleaning , the coffee maker was broken but they still made happen - I got a fresh coffee and I didn't mind to wait ."}
{"text":"The place is uncomfortable with no Ac, detected a foul sewer smell in the restaurant, the portions are super small and pricey ,do not come here also the waitress is really clueless. Save your money and go somewhere else you can get twice the food for the same price somewhere else seriously"}
{"text":"1st time at this restaurant and was unsure weather we should eat there. The place was empty but decided to give it a chance. The food was really good and filling."}
{"text":"I went to place an order 4 pupusas and 1 order of empanadas, I told the lady I'm going too Cardenas while my food is ready. Took about 20 minutes giving it enough time for my food too be ready. Walking in to get my food and a big surprise the ladies were just standing, talking too each other then the cashier came over and said take a seat while your food is ready, they never made my food or place the order even though they charged me and I paid, never had such bad service ever ! Do not recommend this place at all !"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Their Pupusas are good. Lots of meat and cheese. I will be back soon. We ordered through Grubhub and order got here so quick. Everything was hot and accurate."}
{"text":"They took a little while , but it was totally worth the wait,  amazing and authentic food , pupusas were good but what it really impressed me was the \" sopa  de  pata\" very very good, delicious, I tried my boyfriends food and it was great too, so far the best sopa de  pata I've tried in USA.. the waitress was very nice and friendly, she is from Santa Ana, I'm very glad we drove all the way there.. recommended"}
{"text":"A friend was visiting from out of town and we had gone to the lake for the day. I needed to stop by Cardenas to pick up some things, and we thought would grab a bite to eat before heading back to my house. Neither of us had tried Salvadorian food before, and really enjoyed it. The salsa they brought out with the chips was delicious. We got an order of asada tacos and the steak was very tender and everything tasted super fresh. The retried beans and rice were also great.

The tamales were new to me, as I've only had Mexican style tamales, but they were good. The pupusas were great! I need to find a similar spot that's closer to my house, or learn how to make my own since this is on the opposite side of the valley from my house. 

The staff was very friendly and explained what things were that we were unfamiliar with, such as loroco. If I found myself in this neighborhood again, I would definitely stop in for some pupusas.

Edited to add: was able to use the Yelp discount of 15% off without issue, not sure which offer the last reviewer couldn't use."}
{"text":"I walk in and wait for my food to be done and the boy saids he's new and he looked confused on where everything was and very disorganized. His smile was pretty creepy too. And I asked if they had Salvadorian horchata and he said yes so I told him to add it to my order. I had the meat cakes which were similar to empanadas with meat and vegetables in it. They were delicious. And I also ordered their enchiladas. They put ketchup and an egg on top of it. It would've tasted better without the ketchup. But overall it was delicious. He handed me my horchata and I took one sip of it and almost spit it out all over the place. It was the most disgusting thing I've tasted in my life. It literally tasted like peanuts and garlic and just left a horrid taste in my mouth. I told the guy it was nasty and i asked if I can have something else and he said the soda machine was broken. And he said he loves he horchata blah blah and she drinks it everyday. stop lying, it was horrible. So I just left the drink on their counter and left. But the food was good so maybe I'll come back."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! We came in to order 12 Pupusas to go. They was one person eating and a party of 4 waiting for their food. The party of 4 cancelled their order because it was taking forever. Our order was taken at 2:49pm, it is now 3:32pm and we are still waiting for our food. 

UPDATE: 

Despite the long wait, the pupusas were good."}
{"text":"Fantastic and friendly service. Fluent Spanish AND English. Very clean establishment. Best Papusas I've ever tasted. I got the bean & cheese while my partner got the steak. Both were excellent! We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"What a joke! Food looks great but the waitress was RUDE. They did not acknowledge us so when we finally approached she hits us with \"I won't be able to help you for another 40 minutes\". Her reasoning because they had a big party (which actually all had their food already) She wasn't at all remorseful about not being able to give us good customer service she just smiled and said sorry can't help. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: don't waste your money. It took us 25 minutes to even get chips and salsa. Then we are given water with no ice that's warm as well as a warm coke. There were only 5 tables including us there and yet we had the waitress only come to us to bring our food. She never checked in on us or offered a refill even for our water or offer more chips. So a total of 45 minutes since our arrival we finally get our food. We got the molcajete and it was bland and the chorizo was undercooked. Undercooked pork is definitely not ok. The chicken was nasty and steak was flavorless. I basically just ate the nopales and beans. The waitress was also rude when we asked her for ice for our warm coke and water. She slammed the cup of ice on our table and didn't say anything.

THEN... we show the waitress out 15% off for checking in and she said she couldn't process it with our debit card. We told her she can put it through as credit but she said it didn't work. Then we told her if she could just calculate the 15% and just take it off the bill but nope. So we had to pay in full for this nasty food and horrible service. 

Just don't come here. There's way better places in Las Vegas. 

Overall it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Nice place! Awesome service, clean local and the food really good!! I always eat on this restaurant because it's the only one authentic salvadorean food in Vegas!! Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour for our food to come out. Cashier gave our pupusas to her family members who came in and placed order after us. 
Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Pesima comida!  Me sirvieron un café que desde que lo llevaron se le veía el fondo a la taza,  completamente agua caliente con un poco de color.  Solo pésimos 6 pupusas y una orden  de pasteles y tardaron 1 hora para llevarlas y solo habíamos 3 meses...  Lastima porque el lugar esta agradable,  pero ko volvería jamás"}
{"text":"Delicious pupusas! They truly taste authentic. 
I have only received wonderful service every time.

I definitely think it's worth the wait for warm and made to order food."}
{"text":"Wow! So many dishes and daily specials to chose from! I started with a bean and cheese Pupusas which was incredible! I had the chicken tacos with rice and beans- probably some of the best rice I've ever had! 
The place was clean and all the employees were super nice and checked on us multiple times. I will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Was shopping and walked by this place it smelled great so decided to try,  had the tacos  it was really yummy and we didn't wait that long the place was very clean  my new spot for some tasty tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing food, enjoyed atmosphere & great service.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 

Had the papusas, sopes & tacitos.  They have much more on their menu, so we will definitely be back for some more."}
{"text":"Pulled in about 7 pm with five people.  Quickly ordered because we were starving from a long day of travel and then we waited.. and waited and waited.  We waited for an HOUR in a restaurant with 2 other SMALL parties in it.  The food was mediocre at best.  The Pupusas were soggy but tasted fine, but the kicker came several hours later.  Waves of nausea and diarreah.  I will NEVER eat here again, we were all up all night, at one point it was so bad I was thinking I might have to go to the ER.
Stay away!"}
{"text":"I live close to the restaurant and was a a weekly customer. I discovered this place last year when I first moved into our house. At first we would order at least once a month. Our usual was pupusas and I have gotten pan con pollo. And everything in taste was great! But just recently after being a usually customer they told me of a special that was when you buy 15 pupusas  they are $1 each. So of course that became our weekly spot. When our family gets together for game night we always order 20+ pupusas and I never had anything to complain. I would order before picking up and always gave me my food by when they said it would be ready. Now after 1 1/2 months of going every week and ordering for our weekly family get together they start with making us wait 40 min after they tell us they would be ready (when I order 1 hr before) to give us our food and ontop of that the cole slaw(curtido)  they want to give us 2 sandwich size ziplock bags for 33 pupusas and they were very rude in telling me that if I want more to buy more for 1.99. Come one now. When I've ordered 20 they give me 2 1/2 shouldn't I get more for 33. I'm a frequent customer. You would think it being a family owned restaurant that they would treat you better. I am very disappointment and will be taking my  business elsewhere. 



After not having pupusas for a few months. Today we decided to have some for brunch. After talking to Jorge he was very helpful  & corrected what went wrong the last time. This time everything was great! And had enough curtido . Our family loved the pupusas and will be going there as well. And I will be going there more often once Again."}
{"text":"Decided to check this joint out before work. Ordered cheese and chicken pupusa. It was mediocre compared to other spots I tried. The pupusa was a bit smaller than another place I got to and a little bit more expensive. The sauce was ok too, not spicy enough for me. It was ok for a spontaneous attempt. I most likely would not go out of my way to order again nor would I dodge the place if I was back in the area."}
{"text":"Pupusas were raw and beans tasted old and were dry. This is the worst customer service I have ever received. I ordered1 15 pupusas by phone and they said they would be ready in 30 minutes. 35 mins later I show up and my order hasn't even been started. She says come back in 20 minutes. I got my food 50 minutes after. Ridiculous and it happens all the time."}
{"text":"The beans are amazing!! Pupusas are the best! They have plenty of combinations. Cheese and jalapeño is on point . We also had the parillada and it was so much food!! Also good coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Won't be back charge a 30% service fee???
5 of us were dined in that night. I get some places charge auto gratuity for party's of 8 or more but I've only ever seen 18% charged, either way aside the 30% service fee the food took roughly 40 minutes to hit the table. The service was garbage. 
If you wanna get charged 30% service fee to wait 40 minutes for food come here."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place by accident after leaving the market, dissatisfied with the presentation of their food. 
So happy we did because it was the bomb. Very fresh food. The pupusas were delicious and the plantain was perfectly ripe and fried. All of their fresh juices are good too and not to mention the exceptional customer service :) I will definitely be back here sooner than later."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but wait can be a little long - probably because everything is made fresh. Seriously, the best pupusas I've had in a long time. Staff super friendly. You won't regret stopping in."}
{"text":"Forgot to leave a review , I was here a few weeks ago ordered a steak and rice and beans and a papusa. It was around 8 pm and by 12am at night I had one of the worse cases of food poisoning. Was in the bathroom for over 2 hours dieing."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Everything had flavor. It's been hard to find a good Salvadorian restaurant and this place nailed it! Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets! Seriously though, this place is great. We had a bunch of different dishes, a salvadorian plate, salvadorian enchiladas, a pupusa, and a tamale. All of them were great! I would certainly go back, and as soon I am back in town this will be my first stop. If you are in the area, or even all the way in Vegas, you should make the trek down there."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give it a star i called to get soup and the girl that answered didn't even know what was in the soup had to put me on hold and ask what was in it. Went to pick up and went to eat it was SUPER SALTY AND NOT GOOD I DEFINITELY WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!! Don't waste your money on food that is not good and over priced!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken pupusas are AMAZING. They are the best I've had so far. The cashier was quick and friendly. she spoke English and Spanish so there is no language barrier. The location was clean and the food is made to order. Will definitely be returning as a regular. They do deliver."}
