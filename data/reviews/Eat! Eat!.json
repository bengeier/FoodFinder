{"text":"Pleasant surroundings, loads of art, lots of light, good food. The coffee was ok,  just ok. The \"choose four items to add to your 2- or 3-egg omellette\" was a hit - a home run - as was the bread selection for toast. Unfortunately the server was so eager to be quick to get the job done, that she was intrusive."}
{"text":"For the price and quality it's a good place to eat.  I'm a big fan of Yam fries overall, but didn't enjoy the chip version as much."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I go here a lot. They are super cheap, have super service, and their food is great. I love the chicken burgers and their yummy yam chips with jalapeno dip. Great daily specials too. I love Inglewood."}
{"text":"I'm sad that I have to write such a negative update on Eat Eat! They are just around the corner from where I work, making them the most convenient place for me to grab a bite at lunch time. The food is quite good! I have been known to visit a couple of times a week alone or with some coworkers. Mostly for take out but sometimes we dine in. 

Unfortunately I have grown tired of being treated poorly by some of their staff. I'm always smiley and pleasant with everyone there...but for some reason a few of the servers are short with me to the point of being rude. Maybe I am so familiar to them that they don't feel they need to be nice? So I have decided to find lunch elsewhere. There are plenty of places to Eat in this city...I don't care for parting with my hard earned cash in a place where I will be treated poorly."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this little gem failed miserably for lunch on Sunday. We entered the restaurant at 255pm, only to be loudly told that 'we close at 4'. 

We were the only table, and that was probably for the best, as the staff was burping, yelling and arguing loudly by the cash desk. 

The gush and chips I ordered, as well as my friends tuna melt were speedy with tasty hot French fries. My fish was soggy, greasy and very undercooked. The batter was a wet layer that globbed off onto the plate. 

When asked how lunch was I pointed put the fish. The server then went to the cash desk and yelled into the kitchen arguing and bossing someone around loudly about bad fish and chips. 

I was charged for my fries, 5$ and my companion thought that strange. I'm inclined to agree. What else was I supposed to eat?

During the wait for our food another table came in ( about 310pm) and were guilted into leaving by the server who now proclaimed ' we close in 20 minutes'

Rude rude staff, not welcoming, actually quite the opposite. 

Not recommended. Skip right past."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast and lunch. They do half orders so you can often get half of a breakfast type thing and half of a lunch thing. Or half savory and half sweet."}
{"text":"We checked out Eat! Eat! this past weekend for brunch. We weren't sure what to expect when we got there in terms of busy-ness etc but we ended up finding a parking spot right in from of the diner and got a table immediately.  The staff (we had 3 ladies serving us) were incredibly cheerful and helpful, explaining the features and other questions we had about the menu.  

I just had plain old sunnyside-up eggs, hashbrowns, and grilled tomatoes which was delicious.  I know it is hard to screw up a basic breakfast but it is possible.  Mr. got the french toast with breakfast sausage which looked great.  They had a homemade preserve and whipped cinnamon butter which tasted delicious.  

Coffee was good and was constantly topped up which I like -- who likes lukewarm coffee?  

Anyways, to sum up, service was quick and painless and we had an enjoyable time and were back onto the streets of Inglewood in no time.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went to Eat! Eat! today for the first time for breakfast. In my experience, the food was substandard for what you'd get a typical diner and in a small quantity, and on top of this the prices were expensive. 

The poached eggs were done in an egg cooker and came with very few hash browns. It included a substantial amount of ham on the eggs benny, though. Although some may like that, I thought it was gross. The french toast had a thick coating of egg mixture on each side and was more reminiscent of sweet scrambled eggs stuck to the bread on each side. 

I thought that the service was just fine despite the disappointing food.

Overall, in my opinion Eat! Eat! is a quaint little diner in a great location but I would not go back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place and with a lazy Sunday planned in Inglewood,  we decided to stop in for brunch here.  The decor is maybe shabby chic? I dunno. They have some art up on the wall, I assume it rotates and they likely feature different artists, I think that's pretty cool.

The table side service was adequate, we were given our drinks quickly and I have no complaints about that. However, it took forever for our eggs to come out - I have no idea why eggs should take an obscenely long time. That aside, the food was nothing to write home about. In particular, I did not care for the potatoes - but it has come to my attention that I may have higher than average hashbrown standards (hashbrown snobs, unite!!! ha ha ha), I say give them a shot before you sub them out, maybe they're just not for me.

There are a few different places to go for brunch in Inglewood, next time I'm in the hood I will probably suggest exercising our options."}
{"text":"This is one of a few breakfast spots that I use for early morning meetings. Staff are friendly (although I have been there more than 20 times in the past 6 months and they don't seem to recognize me), menu is simple but allows for some individual creativity, coffee flows easily and lingering is encouraged (at least between 7:30 and 9 am).

The last visit, I had1/2  french toast and it wasdelicious with pecan butter and real maple syrup and the 2 slices were plenty for my appetite."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. The food was \"meh\". Normally, that would mean I would give it another try but there are so many good options in this 'hood that I'm not sure I will.  The yam chips were quite good though."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was great.  Best Reuben in a long time.  It was really busy and the wait staff was running.  She shared information and a quip or two and still managed to clear tables.  I am a fan"}
{"text":"Nice casual family operated joint good for lunch.  I liked the Greek salad served with a slab of greasy garlic toast off the griddle.  If you're lucky you can dine on the sofa.  The place was quiet and service friendly."}
{"text":"Woo, I finally get to cross this place off my bookmarks after bookmarking it wayyyyy back in January :D. 

Quiet chatty lunch with Wendytron; our Inglewood passports lured as in with the promise of free yam chips. I had their hemp burger, and from the looks of it, I probably should've smoked an L in the back of a Benz-y before ordering. It was enormous! Wendytron ordered the Moroccan Lentil soup and I found myself briefly suffering food envy. Tucking in to the Brobdingnagian (woo, WOTD) burger quickly cured me of that. The yam chips were tasty and really, my only problem with the burger was that it was dry. Probably due to the lack of mayonnaise (or aioli, tartar sauce, whatever you choose to call your whipped egg sauce). However, this was easily remedied as I am the type who will smother everything in ketchup and hot sauce. 

While paying for my noms, we spotted these adorable hand painted glass trinkets at the register. When I asked who made them, a lady having lunch behind me piped up that her Auntie makes them. Awwww! I love it."}
{"text":"Victim of the 2013 Flood.

I drove to Inglewood this past week and decided to stop for lunch.  Since I was craving Bacon & Eggs I headed towards Eat Eat.

Parked out front a few doors down, paid for parking...  as I headed to their front door I noticed the brown paper covering all window space. Hoping it was just \"closed for renovations\" I walked closer...  the window also has rental signs.

The impact of the 2013 is going to affect many businesses.  Sad to watch.  Want to help out?  Seek out businesses in flooded areas that are open and spend dollars there. For those store fronts that remain closed for repairs - cross your fingers that they will once again open their doors for business.

RIP Eat Eat."}
{"text":"I think this place used to be amazing then the ownership changed. When I went there 3-4 weeks bad I was disappointed. Cute little place but I've had much better eggs Benny, the coffee was really bad, and pretty high prices.
I think I will come back and try it for lunch one day; maybe that is more their specialty."}
{"text":"Had the bacon and grilled cheddar Bennie, nice but not exceptional. Bacon was crisp. cheese melted nicely on a pre-toasted muffin

Side of potatoes and a fair hollandaise sauce

Service was great. small place so go early or expect to wait"}
{"text":"Nothing but comfort food and lots of it.

Eat! Eat! doesn't break any barriers but what they do, they do very well. Just thinking about the tuna melt makes me relax a bit.

The breakfast and lunch combos are all classics. You can very easily bring in three generations of family members here and not have any come any hungry or ask you what something on the menu is.

It tends to fill up on weekends (see above statement about people bringing three generations of family) but even if you have to wait, it's worth it.

Just for the comfort food, brightly coloured furniture, art on the walls, bottomless coffee and friendly staff."}
{"text":"They have little colourful tables and large napkins but it is set up like a restaurant for small children or The Munchkins. The tables are small and low and the chairs as well which for me is a very strange marketing strategy.

They have bright yellow walls that display Bill Dixon's artwork.  

All I can say is that they have affordable food, salads, sandwiches and breakfast till one pm.  The food didn't blow me away nor was I disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot in Inglewood.  The breakfast is consistently good- I recommend the pancakes with maple butter or the eggs Benny.  The service is always friendly, coffee refills are constant, and the ambience is casual, neighbourly, and nicely affected by mostly local art covering the walls (and for sale too). 

The lunch is decent too, but highlighted by regular special soups and mains- usually a good bet.

Eat! Eat! Is one of our neighborhood favs. Even at it's busiest on weekend mornings we rarely have to wait!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"For some reason I've got yam chips stuck in my head and its rotating to the song of Lamb Chops... you remember the little puppet, right? Well, replace that with \"Yam chips.. play along.\" At any rate, I was at lunch with the Queen of SuperFriends(TM) and trademarks at Eat! Eat! yesterday. Donna M and I have been trying to get here for ages, but alas, this time I had to go without her. 

Eat! Eat! is a breakfast and lunch spot in Inglewood. In fact, they serve an all day breakfast if you're so inclined. I'll be in soon to try out breakfast, but this time around, I stuck to the lunch menu and ordered a reuben. In my mind, if there's anything that can make or break a reuben, it's the amount and quality of the sauerkraut. Too much sauerkraut and you overpower the meat in the sandwich, too little, well, it's not really a reuben. And if it doesn't taste good to begin with, it has no business being in my sandwich. Eat! Eat!'s reuben had a pretty equal portion of sauerkraut to smoked meat. And it satisfied my lunchtime hunger pains amazingly well. On the side, I opted for a bowl of Moroccan Lentil soup. Inglewood soups are putting coffee shop soups I've had to shame. Eat! Eat! included. This was a hearty bowl of lentils with a dollop of sour cream on top. I couldn't not have the side of yam chips either. I love that they're actual chips and not fries. I don't think I ate for the rest of the day yesterday, I came out so full!

Eat! Eat!, you're a wonderfully delicious eatery. I took a to-go menu so I can keep track of what I've tried. I can't wait to eat eat more of your nomnoms."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile, but it's a pretty cute little place. A friend and I were in Inglewood lurking about the antique shops and giant record store when hunger struck us. I'm actually kind of scared of most of the eats in Inglewood save for the diners, because they come off as a little pretentious.
However, the good people at Eat! Eat! were hospitable and warm. I explained to them that I was vegan, and the nice lady accommodated wonderfully, although it was pretty easy to find an option there. I ended up with a veggie burger and yam chips and my friend with a giant grilled cheese? That's really all she eats. 
I just saw that someone else had reviewed this little place, and remembered my pleasant experience there. I also love the name. Too cute."}
{"text":"Eat! Eat! (I like to say it like a bird chirping) is exactly what I remember small town diners being like. You can go there all the time and get affordable, home-cooked meals that taste good. 

Eat! Eat! has all of the standard breakfast and lunch fare and they do it up right. Not fancy, just well done. They also have a specials board where they include a rotating menu of fancy/decadent options (stuffed french toast, interesting things with eggs). They do really good soup here and I'd recommend the yam chips. 

The staff is usually the same and pretty friendly, the coffee isn't great, but isn't bad and the decor seems to be inspired by a box of crayons. 

Inglewood is lucky to have such a great variety of restaurants. If you're in the mood for a budget-friendly, home-cooked meal, I say Eat! Eat! at Eat! Eat! (see what I did there?)."}
{"text":"I want to give these guys more than 3 stars...but I really wanted a good bowl of soup and instead I got a really average bowl of soup.  For $9.  Yes, there were other things on the menu that were tempting and well priced - the aforementioned half order of French Toast, my friends had the fish tacos, the 2 year old with us lucked out with his grilled cheese sandwich.

I had the French Onion soup and it was just missing something.  No, it was missing like 5 things....there was just no flavor to it at all.

I was a little too jealous of the 2 year old and his grilled cheese, especially when he loudly proclaimed \"Likey the cheese\".  I likey the cheese too, but the cheese on the soup was just melted goo, lacking in flavor.

I think this place has a lot of potential, I just got unlucky and ordered the wrong thing.  I'll give them another go, but dammit, they'd better have something that I really really likey."}
{"text":"I can't really judge it too much, as I've only tried it once and reading some of the other reviews is telling me I really should give it a second look.  For example, I just read Wendytron and Tiffany's reviews, and now I'm admittedly curious about their lamb chops.

But I did have their Smoked Salmon Benedict, and I found it to be quite competantly done.  My friends had the usual eggs and bacon and other such foods, and they all seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  

Still, it's a quaint little place to be, and I do mean little.  I can't see how they can fit too many people, but the happy faces all filled and stuffed with their brekkies and soups is always a good sign.  Hopefully I can try out the lamb chops so I can give a fairer assessment."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good visit here when my dad and stepmom came to Calgary.  It wasn't very busy, but it took a long time (approaching an hour) to get our food.  This wouldn't be all that bad if the food hadn't been breakfast.  We weren't allowed to order off the lunch menu because it wasn't time yet, but by the time we got our food lunch was being served for a good half hour!

Once we got the food, it was fantastic -- probably the best omelette I've ever had.  The time it took to get our food, combined with their terrible hours (worse than a bank), mean I probably won't be back.

If you don't mind waiting, and want a great breakfast, this is definitely a good place to try!"}
