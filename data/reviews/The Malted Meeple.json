{"text":"Quick planning details for you: -They don't serve meals, just snacks, so plan to eat before/after you go. -Can't bring in outside food either (e.g. pizza).  Rules could be different if you're setting up a formal event with them; didn't do this, so not sure. -Can bring your own games. -Will loan out their games.  Great venue for hanging out to play games with friends, or trying out some new games.  4 of my friends and I brought in Firefly last Friday night after dinner and played from 7-11, and everybody had fun.  We were able to walk right in and grab a table.  The place got busier as the night got later; there was just 1 other group when we first arrived, but it was almost full when we left.  Atmosphere is basically like a geeky gaming/comics shop that conveniently also has a bar.  This is in contrast with other \"bar-first\" gaming places which are bars that also conveniently have games. If you are looking for a hipstery or edgy bar scene that does games, this is probably not your place.  Even though we brought our own, they have an awesome selection of games.  List is on their website.  Noise-level was great for playing games, throughout the night.  At its busiest, it grew to be about on par with a typical sit-down restaurant.  There is not music, TVs, or kitchen noise to talk over either, which helps.  I had never played Firefly before, so needed the rules explained and had questions while playing, and never had to ask my friends to repeat themselves because of noise.  Crowd was mostly 20-30 somethings, but there was also a family that brought kids, and a group with some older adults, so the place seems friendly for all ages.  As another reviewer pointed out, it was not all men either.  Food-wise, I had a delicious \"Dagoba Swamp\" milkshake, which was basically Oreos, vanilla ice cream, and mint blended together, with an awesome piece of half un-blended Oreo at the \"bottom of the swamp\".  Milkshakes also come in an $18 mega size, which is about the size of a small fish bowl.  $18 seemed a little too high for what it was, so I did not order one myself.  We also ordered pretzels and buffalo popcorn, and the portion size was pretty generous for both - good for about 2/3 people.  Chocolate truffles were good but very tiny, probably not worth the $2 a piece.    Having waiters is really nice for a place like this.  Really great not to have to leave the game to go to the bar to get another drink or snacks and then have to wait until your drink is ready to return.  Only negative about the experience is that a few of us felt bugged a bit to buy drinks by one of the waiters, which was disruptive to our game.  It wasn't a huge deal, but given that there is a $5 table fee per person, and that most of us were regularly ordering stuff, it felt a bit unneeded.  I think checking if we need anything, and moving on if we decline, is enough; no need to persist.  I imagine this is just a kink that will get ironed out after they're in business a while.  Definitely don't let it stop you from coming.  All-in-all we had a really great time though, and definitely plan to return again!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place out for the milkshakes, not impressed at all. Stow Cone is better. And paying $ to play a board game? While I like the concept of the entertainment I can't think how it is worth the value. Won't be in business too long."}
{"text":"I feel really torn about giving this place 4 or 3 stars.  But I've decided to go the generous route, at least until I visit some other board game bars to do a comparison.  We came on a Sunday shortly after they opened.  Unfortunately, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (but we knew this going in since it's clearly displayed on their website).  We tried the milkshake flight (3 new flavors they're auditioning to be next month's FOM).  For August it includes red velvet, brownie, and birthday cake.  Honestly, they all tasted pretty much the same to me, and they were rather boring.  We also got some buffalo popcorn, which was fine.  I would have much rather had something more substantial to snack on, or nutritious even.  But their menu options are very limited to things like popcorn, chips, candy, etc.  A cheese plate or some crudit√©s would go a long way here, in my opinion.  Anyway, you don't come here for the food or drinks, you come for the games.  They have a fine selection, which is organized by category.  My husband had already studied their game menu online before coming (which he said is a huge plus for this place compared to other game board bars), so we knew what we wanted to play and didn't really do much browsing.  I would think that the ease-of-browsing/selecting makes a big difference in your overall experience (like it would at a bookstore or library), so my review is lacking in that aspect.  Overall I'd say this place is great just because I love the idea of a board game bar.  But it's also the only one I've been to, so I can't say if it's better or worse than the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Before we went my wife made both of us a dinner of salmon burgers grilled with terriyaki and served with waffle cut fries. They were amazing and our cat begged way too much salmon of us, but I couldn't blame him as it was quite tasty. After dinner was over she agreed to come with me to visit a new gaming cafe in the area, The Malted Meeple. I say in the area loosely, but the greater Cleveland/Akron area is a big area and it was a bit of a drive. Not knowing what kind of games they would have I brought some smaller games for two players along. When we got down there we found the place, though it is a bit set back from the road and I highly suggest looking up its location before you go. Upon entering we were greeted by a nice host, who explained to us there was a five dollar table fee, but other than that you need pay nothing else. He did mention they had a variety of snack foods, shakes, and craft beer. I started out with a water and my wife got a wheat ale. I inspected their game library and noticed that though they had well over a hundred games in their collection, including lots of games I either enjoy or would love to play, they did not have many for two players that were more gamerly. Most of their more interesting games were in the 3-5 player region and felt geared toward groups of that number. Luckily, as I mentioned previously, I had brought some games of my own. We started out with a game of Star Realms, which my wife handily won. While we were playing Star Realms, the host came by with a flight of shakes, similar to a flight of beer, he was showing off. They were the Degeva, the Hoth, and the Tatooine Twist. Once we were finished playing Star Realms we ordered a flight of shakes for ourselves. The Tatooine Twist was sweet and had and orange flavor in it, my wife described it as a orange creamsicle. It was suggested it went with something spicy, like some buffalo popcorn they apparently sold, but having eaten earlier we passed on it. My wife, however, did agree it needed to be paired with something spicy. The Hoth was a malt shake with a subtle spice in it that was really smooth, and Degeva was a cookies and cream with a nice minty flavor. We liked all of them although my favorite was the Hoth and my Lady was most taken by Degeva. The repast being consumed we decided to try another game I had brought, which we both learned on the spot, Biblios. It was a game with some really interesting drafting mechanics and although my wife won, we both agreed that this is one we wanted to play again. I think it has far more depth than it first seems to and it proved quite interesting. When we started setting up our next game, Gravwell, the waiter came by and asked if they could get us anything. We ordered a Mayan Truffle for each of us and received them only a little bit into the game of Gravwell. The truffle was the deep chocolate taste you would expect from a truffle with just a hint of spice at the end, which was a nice touch. That was the finish of a very nice gaming day for me. As far as the Malted Meeple goes I was left with a overall good impression, though I would stress certain points for it. If you go, I would go with a group of three of more. For a smaller group I'm not certain their game library really supports that, unless you bring games of your own. The second point is that this place does not serve lunch or dinner, only snacks. If you are likely to get hungry I would suggest eating before you go. Since this is a game cafe I should probably comment on the tables. They are large with glass surfaces and a raised ridge. While I would have preferred a cloth surface with a bit more texture for traction, the glass surface was not a huge problem. One nice feature was the raised edges of the table, making it harder for dice or cards to slide off of them. These are the only negatives though, and I'm not sure if my comments on the table are not somewhere in between, rather than being a negative. They have tons of good games in their library for 3-5 player groups and from what I could see of the other tables the staff seems to have some familiarity with the games. I did not get to personally ask them to teach a game, but I may make a point of doing so at some point in the future. A big positive for me was the environment and the staff. The feel of the place left one feeling gaming was a refined activity for adults and young adults. It was very welcoming to dates and women and there were, in fact, a number of women there. This paired with an extensive snack and craft brew menu left one feeling they could spend hours here in mixed company or with more casual gamers and everyone could walk away remembering the experience very favorably. Overall I was impressed and for the groups I described, I will likely go here in the future."}
{"text":"Loved our first time here.  The milkshakes were super tasty (I got the emerald ewok) - very foamy and just the right amount of lime and sweetness in mine, and I enjoyed the selection of games offered and the wide, open spacings between tables that helped with sound carry/isolating groups but making you feel like part of a community as well.  It looked like a haunted house from the outside (not well lit and the entrance was out back) but it was nice and bright and open on the inside.  The tables were pretty large, making it easy to play with 4 people, and the environment was pretty chill and easy-going.  It would have been pretty special if the pretzels we ordered were the soft pretzel kind and not the hard, store bought kind - but I do get it, with avoiding messes on board games and all.  It gets a little pricey with the cover fee + snack up charge though (so I'm not sure about Yelp's suggested one $ business) but when you go in expecting it - or if these snacks were signature in some way, it's not so bad then.  Overall, I had a great time here on a Friday night.  A little far from our usual travels, but we would come back again."}
{"text":"2nd time visitor.  Party of 4.  Total cost for 4 hours of play including drinks and snacks was just over $60.  Pretty solid value IMO.  As it was the 2nd visit for 2 of us, we knew what to expect and had selected a game (list of available games on their website) we would try beforehand.  Like most adult level board games, there is a solid learning curve.  The previous visit the host for our table was familiar with the games we chose and gave us a quick run-thru, and he was available if we had mid-game questions.  This visit we had a different host and she was not familiar with the game we chose.  She was pleasant tho, and available for drink orders without being intrusive.  As for the drinks, they have a good selection of brews and alternative drinks.  They have a beer list on their web site, so if you are not too adventurous, check out their list and do a little background work so you don't ask for an IPA when you really are more of a malt fiend.  Their shakes are tasty.  I had one the first time and it was pretty thin, this one was thicker like you would expect.  Snacks (pretzels/popcorn) are served in restaurant style dishes and were a decent enough size serving.  All in all, the table fee is cheap... $5 per person total... and we were there for 4 hours... the drinks and snacks are a little high, but it all evens out... like I said, 4 people, 4 hours, food and drinks... about $15 each... no complaint.  Clean environment, bright atmosphere, place was fairly full for a weekday evening.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I wish something like this existed around me when I was growing up. It would've affirmed that I wasn't weird and that board games and role playing games are cool. I wish I could give it more than five stars. The Malted Meeple is a wonderful place for people to come together, play board games, and drink milkshakes, craft beers, and cocktails. They have some smaller fares, like soft pretzels, soup, and shepherds pie, but they're mostly great for liquid calories.   You are allowed to stay as long as you want and play all of the games you want for $5 a person, which isn't a big deal, since all of the games are upkept and in good condition. Our waiter was really great and recommended stuff on their super large menu! He was super attentive. All the staff was really kind and helpful with all of the games. While it was somewhat overwhelming, they answered all of our questions! I had a Chocolate Chip Wookie milkshake with Bailey's added and it was delicious. After a few games, I had a health potion cocktail. It was fruit flavors mixed with rum - it was super sugary and definitely wasn't as good as the milkshake.   I can't wait to go back to the Malted Meeple and try more of the games and more of the milkshakes, mixed drinks, and coffee drinks. It's a great fun environment and concept. Definitely one of my new favorites in town. Just don't come expecting dinner or lunch - they don't have food food. They also have a ton of parking in front, so don't worry about that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something fun for an afternoon or evening with a few friends. So excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon and had a lot of fun with the family. They had a lot of great games to choose from and the snacks were good. I look forward to going back! The only downfall in my opinion was the bench seats were pretty uncomfortable after a few hours."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to The Malted Meeple, but the first time with the family. It was my wife and two children, ages 10 and 7. We went to play new games and we were not disappointed!  Carrington, one of the servers was very helpful and attentive. We played four games and he help us set up and explained the rules for each game. In the excitement of a game, one of the kids accidentally knocked over their drink. Carrington was immediately over to clean up the spill. Several other group had children as well, and all appeared to having an enjoyable time. Our family had a good time and enjoyed all the games we played. The kids saw there is an early 5 - 7pm New Years Eve party and they have already asked to come to the event. We will be back to learn more new games."}
{"text":"Basically this is my new favorite place! Their milkshakes are SO delicious and they have a great choice of games to play and purchase. It's such a great atmosphere as well, with friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"We were at this cafe at a picture-perfect summer afternoon. The temperature is just right. Not too hot, not too cold.  If it were any other cafe, the outdoor tables would've been full of customers.   Not at this board game cafe, no. All the geeks serious enough to pay a table fee so that they can play game with friends outside of their homes would not dare sitting outdoors. God forbid the wind blows away their \"agility plus three\" card.  There is no real food to order here. Just milkshakes and little snacks. And a huge collection of board games to choose from. Any one can do the exact same thing in their own living room, with the benefit of moms cook better food for you.  However, we had a good time here. That's what's important. No one is nagging you about chores. You play as long, as much, as loud, as hard as you want. The friendly staff support you fully."}
{"text":"My friends and I have gone to the Meeple on and off for about a year now.  Early on we went ahead and purchased the $100 yearly membership.  The concept is great, pay the small fee and enjoy a wealth of board games at your leisure.  The selection of games is great, and most of the staff know the rules to most of them and are willing to explain to new groups.  If you haven't been, definitely give it a try!  Where it unfortunately falls apart is atmosphere and service.  I reeeeeally wanted this to be our local haunt, somewhere we could get together regularly and enjoy drinking and playing games.  But the environment that is created between the atmosphere and the service just makes it uncomfortable once the novelty of the games wears off.  When you realize that you could go out and get a new game between your group for the table fee alone, not to mention save yourself from overpriced drinks and snacks, you realize how important atmosphere is, and for our friend group, it just wasn't worth it.   Once again, I really want this place to succeed, so I'm going to make this review a list of suggestions to management rather than complaints, as I would love to see the place thrive.  -The florescent lights and lack of music can make the room feel very sterile.  Some light tavern music and atmospheric lighting would go a very long way to make it more inviting.   -I'm ok with spending $6 or $7 on a beer every once in a while, but when I do, I would like the glass to be filled to the brim.  I've never been to a bar that deprives me of an ounce or so on my drink every time. -It consistently took 20-30 minutes from the time we wanted to leave to the time we actually left.  The checkout process needs to be streamlined. -The following are subpoints under the point: LOOSEN UP.    +A few of the staff would recognize us and call us by name, but we would still be ID'ed    Every. Single. Time.  This feels awkward.  What are you expecting when you look at it?    +It also feels very weird to have to be seated in a place that is like a bar in every other respect.      +The wait staff just has never felt comfortable or inviting, and they always seem overwhelmed when it is busy.  This could be either training or hiring practices, but something needs to give when we wait 10+ minutes for a water refill most of the time.  There were multiple times when I would have ordered another beer but nobody came for a long stretch. -It was cool to have reasonably priced salty snacks to eat while we drank.  Then the prices went up.  Then you guys started serving soup.  We laughed on the way home at the price vs. portion ratio.  Its just ridiculous.  If you don't serve food, you need to allow outside food in.  Also, for the love of Pete, let my friend bring his water bottle in.  I promise its not vodka.  This list probably seems petty, but this type of place is getting more popular, and these things are going to make or break the business in the midst of competition.  I wish you the best of luck, and I'll probably be back soon to check it out!"}
{"text":"Wanted a fun night playing board games, but our entertainment turned out to be laughing at how awful the customer service was during our whole experience... We came on a Saturday night and knew it would be busy, BUT... When the host took our name, he promised to be right back with an estimated wait time, but he never came back. For a whole hour we were ignored. No one checked in on us, offered us a spot at a bar, or even smiled. Toward the end of our wait, we saw an open spot that the staff missed and were about to ask for it, when a couple who JUST walked in was given it instead. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded waiting for a table if they wouldn't have let a group cut in line. When this happened, we sat down at the bar to order milkshakes to go. There were so many staff members behind the counter, but it took forever for anyone to notice us and give us a menu and take our order. We wanted to leave and pay, but they wouldn't take our money until we held out our cards in front of us. What this establishment does may be unique, but that is not enough to make up for such unfriendly, cold employees. They can't just know board games...They need to learn some basic food service skills too."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out since they opened. I love board games and craft beer so the recent uprising of board game parlors has been a welcome one. Now The Malted Meeple has added milkshakes to the mix!  I finally made it here with a buddy over the weekend and after the experience was glad we came.  The location is interesting as GPS brings you to a gravel driveway with a number of buildings around. There is a vinyl sign out by the drive but I was glad it was still daylight or I might have missed it. As you drive back the driveway splits and another sign points you to towards the right for The Malted Meeple. Another split and this time no sign but it's pretty obvious you go left towards the large building. Mind the large bumps along the driveway. They can swallow your vehicle whole.   It looks like in good weather you can sit out on the brick patio where the entrance is. Inside they have a chalkboard with the monthly milkshake a game special along with a calendar of events. At the end of the hall is a large circular room which is the main gaming area. There are several tables to accommodate various sizes groups, a bar/counter area and the game shelves. We were treated promptly and sat at a two person table and given menus/game lists (I will upload these). The waiter explained the $5 library charge which allows you to play all games as long as you want throughout the day and the various milkshakes, drinks, snacks and alcohol on the menu. He welcomed us to take a look at the library or the game list which sectioned games off by length of time needed to play and how many players each game could accommodate. I cannot tell you how helpful this is when working on a timeline!  A great idea that other board game parlors should incorporate. We got some water to start and selected a game. The game shelves are categorized by style of game (deckbuilding, worker placement, racing, etc) and very well organized. There is a decent selection of games new and old but not as large and diverse as I've seen elsewhere. This is probably due to being a new establishment. The waiter stated that he could help get us started on our game but wasn't completely familiar with the game. This was a bit of a shock as most other board game parlors I've been to the staff is well versed on the majority of games. Perhaps We just picked an oddball one but we had to learn most of the game ourselves which was time consuming.  Not a huge deal though.   I eventually ordered a Tusken Terror milkshake which is dark chocolate and cayenne pepper. It was delicious! Yes most of their drinks/milkshakes have geeking names like The Red Shirt or Dagobah Swamp. I love that attention to detail. There were also a selection of snacks like pretzels and artisan popcorn and chocolates along with a nice selection of craft beers and bourbons.  Prices are bar prices. Most beers are $5 or more, milkshakes are $5 or $6 or you can get a mega milkshake for $18. I assume these are for sharing.  All in all we played 2 games in our 3 hour visit. It was a very calm and relaxing atmosphere with a diverse range of patrons which is common at board game parlors. A small group of 20 somethings played a RPG while a large group of middle aged folks played Scatagories and a family with children played a light card game.  This is a great way to try games before you buy them. Speaking of, they do offer some games and components like dice for retail purchase along with their branded items like pint glasses and t-shirts.  I believe they also sell teas and Star Wars themed chocolates.  Upon leaving I noticed that they have a private room area that you can rent out for parties and larger groups.  This is probably used for their weekly events as well.     There are many good things happening at The Malted Meeple and I think that if you are a board game fan you will enjoy a trip. You may want to research games you want to play ahead of time so you don't spend time reading rules once you are there just in case the workers can't teach you.  This was the only downside to the visit but as I said, it could have been a one time glitch. All in all I found the experience to be a good one and I look forward to future visits with friends."}
{"text":"Overall I loved the venue, service and chocolate milkshake.  My best friend, boyfriend and I visited last Saturday afternoon and had a great time.  This is only the second board game lounge I've ever been to and was pleased with the selection of games and beverages.  However, there's always room for improvement.  It was quite cold...and It would be nice to have a popcorn that is just plain or cheese.  The only two non-sweet options were buffalo ranch and Cajun.  My friend ended up with Chex mix.  And a few 'party' games and nostalgic games would be welcome to break up the strat games.  We did have a great time though."}
{"text":"We go here for the Dungeons and Dragons scheduled events. The hosts are always friendly, informative and attentive. We look forward to it each week!  I've also tried the snacks, milk shakes, beers and other games. We've enjoyed everything about the Malted Meeple."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! It is great to go to after dinner for games, snacks and drinks. I love how there are so many different board games I haven't even heard of. The staff is all great with helping you decide what to play and going over how to play it."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of games and the milkshakes are tasty too,very clean and plenty of space."}
