{"text":"Out of the few Coffee Culture locations I've been to, this one consistently has the best tasting coffee. Their products are always fresh and the coffee doesn't taste watered down compared to other locations (and other chains). Kudos to the staff and management!

Sitting area is very clean and comfortable with plenty of power outlets and free wifi. This is the perfect place to bring your laptop and get some work done when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Coffee Culture in Angus is a delight. The coffee is always hot and fresh. The baked goods are fresh. The menu has great variety. The establishment itself has a great layout and pleasant atmosphere. Always clean and never overcrowded. My coffee shop of choice in Angus."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Great tasting food so far although I haven't had much. Prices are a bit expensive I mean I'm not really interested in paying 7 bucks for a smoothie"}
{"text":"This is a cozy, beautiful little cafe. Their desserts, lunches and drinks are to die for. Everything they sell here is very tasty . Theices are similar to second cup or Starbucks. It's hard to find a seat there at times but it is worth the wait to sit down. You also have the option for take out."}
{"text":"Environment is awesome. The place really pays attention to detail. High quality coffee and baked goods. Have yet to try their breakfast but will soon. 

Order their cold coffee CCino, so so good!"}
{"text":"This location open recently. My wife and I stopped in for lunch. We were expecting a basic coffee and donut style operation. We were surprised at how nice the restaurant was. There was an excellent selection of sandwiches and wraps. It took us a few minutes to decide because we weren't expecting such an interesting and varied menu.    

This location has friendly staff that helped us choose from the menu board. The staff were also very friendly and after ordering the meal was brought to our table. A staff member (he may have been the manager) came over to remove the dishes and chat with us. 

The 2 wraps, soup and coffee came about $18. The ingredients were all fresh, wonderfully prepared and looked appealing. 

We will definitely return and we'll check out other locations as well."}
{"text":"Good place to go and grab dessert and relax. Go there 2-3 times a month and have always seen some new dessert. Prices are what you would expect. Much better environment that Starbucks. Not a five rating because I have had some of the drinks that were not really anything special/ had a tea that was basically water. Go get some cake!"}
{"text":"Great place in Angus for a nice latte or something different from Timmies. A nice spot for a snack, date, homework or coffee break. They have really good baked good and desserts. My favourite is there green  pistachio muffin!!! Staff is great and a welcoming environment. They have senior deals on Tuesday and military deals on Monday. They also have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Now this is what we need!  A terrific coffee shop, serving a very nice coffee, offering a wide assortment of sandwiches, soups, cakes and snacks.  Lots is seating.  Hardly anyone with laptops.  Shhhh!  Don't tell too many people about that.  They need to open more of these stores.  Leaps and bounds better than a Tims.   Fast and friendly service to boot."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, prices are fair and my drink is always made properly. A great place to study or go on a date."}
{"text":"Great Coffee, breakfast and salad! The price is right and service was great. The mango almond salads is definitely worth a try. I've had probably one of the best organic coffee in the area as well."}
{"text":"Great service from the young ladies working the counter. Great environment for a casual dessert and coffee/ tea."}
{"text":"If you don't mind spending $4 on the same coffee you could buy across the street, come here!

AKA Not worth your time or money!"}
{"text":"love the atmosphere...so relaxing and nice

perfect place to study and i love the Godiva cheesecake"}
{"text":"Have been to this location on several occasions, at different times of the day. It always seems busy (that's a good thing), but not too busy. Easy to  find space to sit and work, or chat with a client or a friend.

Management seems attentive and on the ball. 

Great alternative for me to meet with clients for a quick coffee. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
