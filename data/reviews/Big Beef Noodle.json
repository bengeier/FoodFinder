Now that that's out of the way...
Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.

Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!

Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill."}

{"text":"Try the spicy noodle soup. Nice flavors. Soy milk is fresh, warm & delicious. Will definitely come again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Come for the lamb and beef!! Best portions and taste with simple ingredients and a home cooked feel! It does take a little while for some items to come out but it's worth the wait for a home cooked feel. So says my boyfriend from China."}
{"text":"We ordered an order of Potstickers, Beef Pocket and lamb skewer. It took us 15 mins to get the skewer and 34 mins for the rest of the order. Including us, there were only 2 tables. Food was so so, nothing excited. Don't go if you are in hurry."}
