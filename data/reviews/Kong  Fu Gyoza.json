{"text":"I had lived in Mesa for 15 years and never knew this place existed, much less the whole plaza.  Amazing variety and selection of gyoza. We ordered 4 different types just to try them out and had a good number of leftovers. Prices were great!  Strongly recommended to any gyoza fan."}
{"text":"I love dumpling and everything home made. So when I learned about this place, I was excited to know there's a specialty dumpling restaurant/ place closer to me.  I ordered pan fried dumpling, boiled dumpling, pork pie, and soup from the owner's recommendation. But when the dumpling came out, I was disappointed right away.   Even though they informed me their dumpling skin was homemade from scratch, you can tell they are machine made and previously frozen. The dumpling/ pie flavor was also blunt and not very tasty. My friend and I was really unsatisfied with the food.   The two of us end up paying $30+ for the four little items we ordered. For a food court type of place, I think the price was bit expensive.   Not sure if I will go back to again."}
{"text":"Great Gyoza!  Best in the valley...the lady in the front is very sweet..Love this place."}
{"text":"Very tasty and genuine Chinese food, love the spicy & sour noodles! Also, the make skin, beef pan cake, gyoza are also very good."}
{"text":"i tried three times at this restaurant, the short ribs noodle soup is pretty good.  but today, i tried again, the soup base changed, noodle feels not the same as i previous had, and the short ribs..is tough.  hope it could keep up with the quality of the food...it is unique in town.."}
{"text":"I love both the food here and the super friendly owners that run this happy restaurant. Came here by accident when one of my other restaurants was closed for the day and decided to try them out.  They have a small but unique menu with all sorts of different flavors to explore. Really like the homemade noodles along with their tasty hot sauce. Definitely gives the meal a little kick without going overboard.  Some of my favorites are the Szechuan Dandan Noodles, Chuanbei Hot and Sour Bean Noodles, the many types of Gyozas, and the Jalapeno Pork. Can't wait to try out something else.  Can be a small language barrier when ordering. Just take your time and order by number to make it easier. She is very helpful but sometimes makes me giggle a bit. They also have pictures of several dishes on the wall to help you make your selection.  Located inside the food court area in Mekong Plaza with a seating area that is shared with other restaurants. This is a very no frills eating area but worth checking out and an inexpensive way to enjoy some tasty vittles. NICE!"}
{"text":"Another new food stall in Mekong Plaza.  Chinese. Short but interesting menu.  Everything is \"home made\" including the noodles.  Pretty good.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"First: These folks make everything by hand. Second: The lady who works the counter could not be any nicer - she was wonderful, and very tolerant of our extremely energetic and UN-shy two year old \"baby giraffe\" of a daughter. On to the food. Pot Sticker Dumplings - Fresh, grilled perfectly, crispy on one side. As good in texture and feel as they were in flavor. Soy milk - Sugar to taste, served warm - they make this on site too. Perfect for calming down a spice burn. Beef noodles - The beef is tender, and not stringy. This is rare. They're using higher quality beef cuts than I'm used to. Chive pancake - Just like I had in Wuhan, but less oily. Very fresh taste, highly recommended. Sour and spicy noodles - Quickly becoming a favorite. I usually order without cilantro, but that's just my preference. I'm one of those people who can taste cilantro TOO well. Ok, saying something is better than something else doesn't necessarily mean the item being compared to is \"bad.\" The other thing is just better. Keeping that in mind, I feel Kong Fu Gyoza is better than the venerable China Magic Noodle. Sure, it's more of a \"food stall,\" but... the food I get... tastes better to me. I've been to mainland China something like 35 to 37 times, to all of the Five Dragons except Chengdu, and I nearly never eat hotel food - I insist on local places that serve local cuisine, and have on many occasions eaten at home with people in China - plus my wife is Chinese (via Malaysia). So I can say with some expertise that eating here DOES give you the experience of what food in China tastes like. It is not Americanized. You will NOT need to add Sriracha or any other sauce to these dishes. The pot stickers come with little cups of dipping sauce, but I honestly barely touched them. They're delicious as-is. We'll be back. I already want more noodles. How to improve? Simply, better location. But I'd be perfectly happy going there right where they are - often growing a business too fast or in the wrong way destroys it, and I'd hate to see that happen here."}
{"text":"Great Food! If anyone write a negative comment, it would be a offence to this new business. It is a grand new opening restaurant and the boss and their chef really try to make the food as authentic as possible. And the Price is just so low that even make me want to pay more in the tip as compensation. If you do not like the food it means that this type of food are not suited for you but not means that this food is bad. Go there and try, I bet you will like it if you like Chinese food."}
{"text":"I just tried the pan-fried \"combination gyoza\" (\"shrimp and leek pork corn mushroom in flour wraps\" is how it's described on the menu). YUM!! Just the ticket when you're craving dumplings. I'm looking forward to working my way the rest of the menu, which is short and specialized in dumplings, noodles, and fried hand pies (xianbing). It's a no-frills, food stand experience, but the prices are good, as is the food. They also sell 40-pic bags of frozen dumplings for $10-15 (haven't tried those yet, but might soon)."}
{"text":"A nice find in Mekong Plaza's food court.  The xian bang was excellent and perfectly seared.  Nothing came apart and the bread was chewy and flavorful.  The Dan Dan Noodles aren't the greatest, but at least they're Dan Dan Noodles, unlike some other places I've eaten.  It's a great little shop that's worth the small trip to the plaza."}
{"text":"This place is hella underrated. As we all know, there aren;t that many (or great) szchewan style restaurants in the Phoenix valley. one day when I was searching for szchewan style food on Yelp, I cam across this. Oh my goodness this place has great szchwean style and northern Chinese style dishes. I recommend everyone to try the spicy cold noodles and the red bean soup. So bomb! They also have handmade soy milk which tastes great. The only thing I don't like is that the surrounding area is pretty dirty and lots of flies."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times after coming the first time and they are not open? Can someone tell me if they are closed for good???"}
{"text":"Love these types if places. Cheap hole in the wall food that is very tasty. Had the chicken gyoza steamed. Rare to see chicken dumplings so this was a good choice. Can't wait to try out the others. Got the Dan Dan Noodles. The pork sauce was more salty than spicy and the flavor was different than what I remember as a kid. Not my favorite but those handmade noodles...OMG. Sooo good!! I could just eat that with just the smidgen of Dan Dan sauce. Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of chewiness and bite. I'll certainly have to try the jia jiang mien since that's also with the homemade noodles. I wonder if their other noodle dishes use the same noodles. If anyone finds out, let me know! So so good.  Got their hot fresh made soybean milk. The lady puts some soft soybean pudding in the cup first. It melted into the drink once she poured it. Pretty tasty. Not too sweet which is how I like it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious potstickers! Slow service though. I ordered the 12 piece combination fried dumplings to go, and it took a good 20+ minutes for them to make and prepare them. Once I got my meal though, the dumplings were near perfection. Freshly made, piping hot, the outer dough had a crunchy texture from the frying, and the meat inside was tender and very flavorful, with a little bit of broth.  I'll definitely go here again, but not when I'm in a rush to get my food."}
{"text":"They are the best Chinese food in town! The chief had a restaurant at Chandler back on 2009, and we were regular customers even we were to drive 40 mins every time from home. Now they finally opened one near ASU, and man, I was soooooo happy! Eat there whenever I can. Just my favorite place!"}
{"text":"Best northern Chinese food restaurant in Tempe! I've been living in northern China for several years and their food remind me of the place I've been to. The price and the food quality both are unbeatable. Might be a little bit hard to find, but this small restaurant locates in the corner of Mekong plaza. You will be glad after you try their foods! :)"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and so is the staff.  They are so polite and very accommodating.  I tried several of their noodles, dumplings, side dishes, and homemade xianbing.  They are all very good.  Beef is very tender in the beef noodle soup.  Dan Dan noodle is my favorite.  It is probably the most authentic Chinese food you will find around here.  One thing I learned on my last visit is that they make their own hot chili sauce in oil.  Great stuff!  I forgot to mention, food is pretty cheap."}
{"text":"This former owner of Lili gyoza moved into the Mekong Plaza for his Northern Chinese cuisine directly from Beijing.  Great food at reasonable prices..He has great dumplings with three flavors to choose from as well as Cha Jiang Mein (Korean Style dark sauce dry pasta with minced pork), as well as Chives pockets (Jeou Chai Jen Bing) that is only available in Beijing with very fine layer filled with aromatic flavors.  The only draw back that it is in cafeteria style so you will have to eat in a very open atmosphere just like a typical food court in a mall.  It is ok with me because this is home style cooking without having to fly over to the other side of the world."}
