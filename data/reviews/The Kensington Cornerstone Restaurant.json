{"text":"The Kensington Cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.  It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been."}
{"text":"After reading some great things about this place, myself and my boyfriend decided to check it out one Sunday morning. I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. 

Our first impression when we arrived was comfy. It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. The service was friendly and fast, although when we asked if the heater beside our table could be turned on (it was chilly), we were assured that it would be, but unfortunately this did not occur. So we were pretty much glued to our cups of coffee to keep us warm, which was very tasty. The waitress was even kind enough to inform us of where their coffee came from, a nice touch of table side romance.

Little things I noticed (I'm all about the small details) is the table sugar was stored in a container used for salt, which when poured streamed out at a snails pace. I liked the menu though, only one page and very simple, although a bit pricey. But seeing as the location is a prime one, I guess this makes sense. 

We ordered the Breakfast Platter ($13) and were told that it was quite filling for once person, so for two it would hit the spot. And seeing as I always ate less than my boyfriend anyway, we thought this would be the perfect choice. As an add on to the dish, we could also choose a side of beef for $2, but we substituted for bacon and sausage. 

Our meal was delivered approximately 25 minutes after ordering, which was quite a wait considering it wasn't a busy morning (two other occupied tables). The pancakes were nice and fluffy, although our sausage and bacon were quite disappointing, with one and a half strips of bacon and two sausages the size of a pinky finger. The sausage was good with a spiciness to it which was lovely. Our eggs came out fried even though we asked for poached. 

All in all, the Breakfast Platter didn't hit the spot at all, as we were still quite hungry afterwards. 

The bill was $27 in total, although we noticed we were charged $3 for the one and a half strips of bacon and $3 for the two pinky size sausages. When we questioned this discrepancy (as it said $2 side on the menu), and our surprise at the ridiculous price, we were given an embarrassed shrug from the waitress. 

Even though the food was good, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We have been going to this awesome restaurant that is entirely gluten free for quite a while, and I thought it was high time for a review.

It's nice to have a place that celiacs can safely eat gluten free - no gluten in the kitchen means no risk of cross contamination, while still serving up the meat. The staff are very knowledgeable, accommodating and friendly. I also really love the atmosphere-- unique copper-glass artwork adds to the charm.

My fave is the poutine with their homemade gravy. You must try this. I also love their challah bread. Though all of their sandwiches are tasty, my top recommendation goes to the maple-glazed pulled pork sandwiches. I also highly recommend the mango salmon fillet. Their chocolate cake is really tasty, I always wish there was more of it... if you are still somehow hungry at dessert time, you should probably get one of their pies."}
{"text":"****First a disclaimer to those who have called this place overpriced.  

You are mistaken.  Gluten free baking and cooking is expensive.  There are few ways to cut costs.  Our flours cost three times if not more than standard wheat flour.  Also, we need to use a combination of flours to make bread and other items.    Next time you are in a show look at rice flour, potato starch, amaranth flour, potato flour, quiona flour and x. gum.   All of that goes into some flour blends.   Ok, i am off my soap box now.

Review: 

A friend forwarded the BlogTO post on the KCR and we decided to try it out last night!  It was the perfect night to be out on a patio eating delicious food!

As someone who can't eat wheat, gluten, dairy/ casein and soy, this cafe played host to all my culinary dreams.  I could order most items without having to ask the restuarant a million questions that aren't often understood by those without dietary and allergy restrictions. 

If you have a corn allergy, this place is not for you with items that are battered.  All the batter is made out of corn.  Also, the gravy is thickened with cornstarch, be aware.  I didn't ask if they only have one fryer....hm, next time.  

The bread is amazing and from Molly B's.  You can purchase it directly from KCR as well.   They had a greate selection of sandwiches. It was so delicious to bite into Challah bread that tasted like Gluten filled bread.  It was fresh and so lovely.  Note: the bread is wheat and gluten free.  the bread is also dairy, corn and nut free. 

** Celiacs, esp new ones, be aware to ask questions re: are items wheat free and gluten free. 

The poutine is amazing. Seriously amazing.  Eating fries without thinking or asking or fearing they are flour-coated is a magical. 

All four gluten free beers are available here.   Note: the Red Ale is gluten free but not wheat free. (buckwheat and millet in it - i am not here to debate buckwheat and millet's safety, you can decide for yourself and your body). 

This resturant proves that Gluten Free can be delicious.   I would suggest a different batter for the nuggets.  the nuggets were kinda dry, but we could tell they were real chicken.  BONUS! almond crust is a fave of mine, but it also quite expensive.


The restaurant boasts of fresh produce and ingredients.  Staff were friendly and knowledgable.  Also a sign of a great space!   


thanks KCR!!!!  i can't wait to bring more GF friends to your space!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister's family since she's been trying to be as gluten-free as possible for her 3 kids and this place promotes itself as \"family friendly\" which hard to find in the area.
We came here for a late lunch on a Saturday. While we waited for them to set up the table for us (there were 6 of us), we sat in the elevated 'lounge area' which was perfect for the kids to unwind & play with their new toys/books they got at The Good Egg. 

The \"Kids' Stuff\" had the typical kiddy fare: mac n'cheese, chicken fingers, grilled cheese sandwich & fish n' chips. Being typical kids, they loved the fries. My nephew who's the pickiest of them all, just nodded his head, gave us a thumbs up with a mouth full of fries when we asked him if he liked it.  

The adults had sandwiches - tuna, pulled pork & cheese-steak. The bread was surprisingly good and tasted fresh.  It wasn't hard and didn't taste different from regular bread. My brother-in-law had the cheese steak sandwich which he liked but tasted more like roast beef than a steak. Pulled pork was delicious but could have been more \"pulled\" as there were a few large chunks of pork. The tuna salad was good - standard, but good.  

I'll have to come back to try out their brunch."}
{"text":"Been interested in trying this place for a while, given the gluten free options - especially fish and chips! Finally ate lunch there and it was quiet with only a half dozen customers at the peak. Sat on the patio and requested to sit in the shade because of hot summer sun and 30 degree heat. Was seated at a table half in the sun and after overheating, requested to move to one of the 3 other empty tables actually in the shade but was told those tables are reserved for parties of 3+. All were vacant - but reserved for theoretical customers of the future. So had to move the table periodically during the meal and sit on the edge of the chair to prevent from burning. Fish was mediocre, fries were good, coleslaw was limp and flavourless (yesterday's?). The restrooms provided a smell adventure usually restricted to rows of port-a-potties at death metal concerts. The highlight in terms of borderline sub-health code cleanliness, was when the chicken delivery guy rolled up (literally) with a wire shopping cart. As he tried to remove the cardboard box within, about 2lbs of raw chicken wings fell onto the concrete in front of the entrance to the restaurant. They were able to pick up the spill minutes later, but hardly food handling to instil confidence in your meal. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday as part of my bachelorette weekend and it was phenomenal.  As someone who cannot eat gluten, it can be hard to find truly gluten-free restaurants, let alone ones that are tasty and affordable.  The Kensington Cornerstone has it all.  Brunch was delicious, prices were reasonable, the atmosphere was fun, the music was great, and the server was friendly and attentive.  I could not be happier and definitely intend to go back to The Kensington Cornerstone the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place since I'm newly gluten-free due to health issues. But I was pretty disappointed all the way around.

First impression when walking in the door? The place reeked of mothballs! I don't know if they had just had some chemical treatment done recently or what, but smelling moth balls in a resto is really unappetizing. Not to mention toxic.

Next, the portions were all tiny. Well, certainly not dinner sized. And we were there for dinner. I had the club sandwich with soup, and I was hungry after cleaning my plate. The bread was Alice In Wonderland small, so the whole sandwich was little better than snack sized, and the butternut squash soup was fine - but I would have liked to have known it was made with apples before I got it, as I'm also on a sugar-free dietary restriction.

My boyfriend had the pulled pork with soup, and his had more meat on it than mine had, but he also felt it was a light lunch sized meal. And we were paying full size dinner prices.

I won't likely be returning to Kensington Cornerstone. I'd much rather hit up Hibiscus, or some of the other restaurants that have gluten free options, without the mothballs or anorexic portions."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a sunny Sunday afternoon for a meal on the patio. 
The first server was very pleasant and took our drinks orders. Very good mojito and peach iced tea! 
The second server provided a huge helping of attitude. We asked about the spicing of one item, and he criticized how we asked and wondered aloud \"how pedantic should I be?\" I know it's a hip place but try not to be pained by the questions customers have about the food. 
Quinoa burgers were fine. Good fries and salad. Just could have done without hipster snottiness."}
{"text":"The quality and quantity of the food does not warrant the price. I cannot recall a time when I was more disappointed with a dining experience. I resented paying the bill. Avoid this place unless you like overpriced bad food."}
{"text":"Great food. Quiet atmosphere. My wife and I love going here."}
{"text":"PROS: Friendly staff 

CONS: Awful coffee (instant perhaps?), extremely stingy meat portions, long wait for cold overpriced food - I completely appreciate that gluten free baking and cooking is expensive, however the dishes we had for brunch did not consist of using any of these gluten free items.  This place really upset me as I was hoping for so much more as I really love this area and was hoping it would become my new brunch go to spot - but I was completely let down. 

Unfortunately in a city with a tremendous amount of fantastic brunch options, this place just doesnt cut the mustard."}
{"text":"For a number of years now, my wife and friends have had to hear me constantly complain about my stomach problems (I feel bad for them, although I feel that being able to eat whatever you want whenever you want gives them some small comfort). I am still not sure what it is that gives me such trouble, but am pretty sure it is food related.  I know I am not Celiac in the strict sense but I feel that I may have a slight intolerence to gluten/wheat.  I am most definitely lactose intolerant to boot.

That in mind, my wife was very excited to tell me about this place.  Everything on the menu is gluten-free, good start.  However, most of the items on the menu that sounded good have cheese in them.  Now I love cheese but it does some awful things to my inner workings.  So I was hoping (as I knew the owner suffered from allergies himself and indeed opened the restaurant for this reason) that there would be some good lactose-free or vegan alternatives, man that cheesesteak sounded good!

I was disappointed to find that this was not the case, especially as there are a number of well stocked cheese emporiums in the market that offer excellent examples of said product.

We settled on 2 of the items which did not contain cheese, the pulled pork sandwich and the turkey bacon avocado club sandwich.  The pulled pork had an excellent flavour, but the club was dry and bland and needed some more mayo or other sauce to pep it up.  The fries were good and the salad was ok.  The gluten-free bread was pretty good, so a shame about the lack of flavour in the one sandwich.

We had a pitcher of cocktail (tequila surprise I believe??), which did not taste like it had any alcohol in it and made us feel a little nauseous due to the very sugary nature of the juice used in it.  I would avoid the cocktails as I don't feel they are worth even the $12 they cost.

The service, while friendly, was a little green.  I don't know whether it was the guy's first night or week, but he didn't seem to know much about the menu.  We got the impression that the whole operation is a little \"fly by the seat of the pants\", and maybe it is a new place and just ironing out the creases.

On the whole underwhelmed and overcharged (although we understood there would be a premium for GF products), almost $50 for 2 sandwiches and a pitcher of green sugary water!

I hear the breakfast is good, although we most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of being threatened by the waiter today. 
While passing this restaurant and considering a light snack with my nephew (who was next door at that amazing new barbershop getting his haircut) I decided to use the facilities and was greeted by a waiter afterwards who demanded me to give him five dollars for using the facilities if I chose not to eat there. Once I told him that I was not going to eat there he then proceeded to threaten to kick my ass. This place is certainly not one that I would recommend if you want to be treated with decency and kindness.
His aggressive approach to my exiting the washroom and demanding payment for usage certainly didn't encourage me to want to stay and have food.
Very poor customer service and very angry staff."}
{"text":"Went back to the Cornerstone for brunch today and was less impressed than when I visited for lunch and dinner. The service was similar to previous visits, which is to say that it was adequate and pleasant enough but no more than that. 

I had the cornerstone eggs, which is basically eggs Benny served on their gluten free Russian pumpernickel bread (which I love - I've been known to buy loaves for use at home). It was tasty, but the presentation was a bit sloppy and amateur, the peameal was thin, and the bread was soggy - I would expect the bread to be toasted prior to being stacked with eggs and sauce. I like that the home fries are a combo of white and sweet potatoes, but they were swimming in a pool of oil.

My brunch date, Sam R., had poached eggs with home fries and fruit - the fruit looked tasty and it was served with cheesy bread. Yum.

Still good, but I won't rush back for brunch. I will definitely return for dinner."}
{"text":"Great service, good drink specials, awesome patio, nice ambience. We went as a big group and had a great evening! Ptichers of sangria... delicious! Same for the mojitos! They were both on special when we were there. The food was also spectacular. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One star for decent (if not slightly awkward) service. The food was just bad, there are no two ways about it. Everything was seriously under-seasoned. Just because it's gluten free doesn't mean it has to taste bad. Wife had mushroom soup and the burger and I had the stuffed pepper. We ate less than half and even after we expressed our concerns to the waiter, we were never comped or offered anything except a salt shaker.

It seemed to me that these people don't care about the food they make, or they have no idea what flavor is. It isn't that it tastes bad - there was just NO taste; completely flavorless. $30 for a tasteless lunch? No thanks, pass and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This restaurant is so delicious for celiacs and non-celiacs alike. I am from out of town and went twice in one weekend because it was so tasty. The service was fabulous and they had an amazing patio. Best gluten free food I have ever had at a restaurant, especially for brunch."}
{"text":"There's so many options around the Kensington market but we ended up to this place. It was a BAD DECISION. We ordered a peach iced tea with rum pitcher and we waited for a long time to get it. There's 2-3 groups before us and they received their drinks/food while we have to remind our server for our drink. We received our food before our drinks. Go to this place if you don't mind waiting for a long time and don't mind paying overpriced small serving subpar meal."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for brunch and it was absolutely delicious!  The Cornerstone has a lovely patio and wonderful associates. Everyone was warm and friendly. 

I was also really impressed with the menu. Everything was gluten free and really delicious!

I had the egg sandwich and it was scrumptious. My friend had two eggs cooked to her liking and she really enjoyed the food.

I will definitely be back for great service and food."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm gonna have to go 3.5- not quite the 4 just because I'm personally not in need of gluten-free, but if I were it would definitely rate at a 4- 4.5 for me.

I came here with my dear gluten-free friend and it was pretty much like a good pub/resto place for me in terms of food, atmosphere, price, cleanliness (bonus in the sometimes dingy kensington area...or Toronto in general) and location.

We sampled quite a few things at the table which all came on cheese challah/egg bread (which was like, REALLY good bread for me- and probably AMAZING bread for my gluten-free friend).

At the table we had:
-Calamari- really nicely breaded and seasoned with homemade tartar (which was excellent and plentiful
-Poutine (GET THIS- with the MEAT gravey- we liked it so much at the table we asked the server for the recipe and she was the master-chef herself!  She was kind enough to share the secret: about 9 different meat drippings + bacon + seasoning)- definitely nothing you can make at home unless you cook a lot of different meat and aren't shy about saving all that fatty goodness- whcih I certainly don't do)
-Chicken fingers- came with standard fries- lightly salted and peppered (nothing special but definitely satisfying)- came with some sort of zesty sauce
-a range of sandwiches, chicken, pulled pork and portobello mushroom.  all standardly good but, again, if you are gluten free I imagine it was a dream to be able to have tasty bread again.
-the coleslaw that came with the sandwiches was made with dill and onyl second to the type of coleslaw you get with jerk chicken plates (which is my personal fave)

-the desert menu looked GOOD.  but I was stuffed.  My friends ordered the brownie and it came with a mound of nuts (pecans.) on top.  It looked delicious, even for me who doesn't like brownies or pecans.  And the deserts were really affordable too.

Two notes:
*bonus that they sell gluten free bread- comes frozen but after trying it at the resto it certainly is a delicious option
**be careful that you know notice the difference between gluten free and wheat free- the beer options are all gluten-free but they contain wheat- something I'm not too familiar with in terms of allergy, celiac? or other stuff but if you are any one of these i'm sure you'll know what you can or cannot have- ask to read the label before they open/you consume the beer.
***I cannot stress enough that the place was clean and the decor was really nice-Cleanliness can make or break a place for me.  This place was definitely clean."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Definitely will be going back again!  Lots of excellent & varied menu choices and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I went here a few times with a group of friends. Love the fact that the menu is gluten-free and environmentally conscious. We have met the owner, so it was very personable. I must agree that meat portions are on the small side but it seemed like a good amount for one person. Amazing beer. Cool art/decor. Long-ish waiting time. Overall I enjoyed the place, I am going to go there again."}
{"text":"Food was bland and overpriced. Salad had no dressing. Mushroom sandwich was slimy and waiter was obsessed with offering me pork"}
{"text":"During a day trip to Toronto with a Celiac friend of mine (among others) we literally looked around Kensington Market for an HOUR looking for this restaurant. After accosting everyone within a good distance and pestering other restaurant waitstaff, we were about to give up hope! We were starting to believe this gluten-free place was much like the Jackalope or Tooth Fairy, only a myth. On our way Queens street, we look to our right, and there was the mythical creature we had been chasing. With a big, huge sign surrounded by lightbulbs. Doh!! My group went into the restuarant and fell in love. I had the pulled pork sandwich with this cheese, potato, and bacon (the three food groups) soup and a tropical margarita. My gluten intolerant friend had a cheesesteak with fries and a gluten free beer. She was esctatic because this was the first place she'd been to in ages th't have to worry about how her food was bring cooked and she could actually eat off everyone's plate if she so felt. My soup was amazing, with cheddar on the top and crunchy snap peas in it that gave a refreshing crispness to the soup. The pulled pork was to die for and suprisingly filling considering it wasn't a HUGE sandwich, it wasn't small, just very filling. The cocktail, well those could be dangerous. You couldn't taste the alcohol in it, in fact, I had to ask because I was sure there wasn't! Deffo getting a pitcher next time!! All in all the food was amazing and not overly priced, the waitstaff was friendly and talkative, and (unless you're directionally challenged like I am) it's easy to find. It's literally, on a corner. In a group of four with only one person who has Celiac, all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and we will be making semi-routine trips from Buffalo to Toronto in order to go to this place."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!

Popped in for brunch with a couple friends and had a very good experience, so much so that I'm eager to come back.

They've got a few options for seating:  Outside patio (avoided due to smokers and impending rain), basic indoor diner tables, and a nifty, cozy lounge area (where we set up shop).  Ambiance is casual and cool, maybe a bit unfinished but certainly inviting.  

Of note, the washroom is oddly located and we watched easily a dozen people awkwardly try to find it (two of whom asked us if we knew where to go).

Anyway, on to the food!  

I wasn't particularly hungry this time around, so settled on the \"kid's menu\" grilled cheese.  My friends shared a pulled pork poutine (which they devoured, giving thumbs up to).

The grilled cheese (and fries that came with) was awesome, and more than most kids are really gonna eat.  Very generous portion.  Tasty cheese, nice fluffy bread with a good outer crunch, garlic butter (!!!)... damn.  Gluten free?  I call shenanigans!  (Ok, not really, I believe them... but man, was that ever good bread!)

Of note, the poutine used actual, real, very nice chicken gravy.  It's a classic.  You can't really go *wrong* with it; Cornerstone used it to bring a whole world of *right*.

Outside of this, we had a pitcher of Hoptical Illusion (yum!  nicely floral, hoppy, smooth, refreshing!).  All told, with tax and tip, the bill came to... hm.  I want to say $42.  Totally worth every penny.

Oh, and the service was great -- prompt, quick, and a bit quirky.  We liked the guy.  He probably thought we were geeky and obnoxious, but that's ok, it's our opinion of him that matters in a review!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. As a gluten free person I appreciated that I could choose anything on the menu. That being said the food was fairly good. Not great. I ordered the eggs Benny. It came on gf pumpernickel. And peameal bacon. The poached eggs were the cooked in a poached pan kind of poached eggs. I prefer proper poached eggs cooked in water. The hash was not bad. It could have been cooked to a bit crispier. But it was a lovely flavour. I also had the spiked peach iced tea. Now that was good. It was not super sweet. And the alcohol was noticeable but not know you off your feet strong. All in all a good meal. I'll totally come back for dinner one day to see what their dinner menu is like."}
{"text":"lacking atmosphere ....the best word to describe it would be \"stale\". trying hard to be a French bistro and staff are polite but theres no charm to be found. 

cocktails are very underwhelming (very watered down) and food is mediocre and under seasoned (e.g. lentil soup was fresh but bland, mango chili lime skewers had a weird combo of textures and tastes - i don't like hard mushroom and mango on the same stick...strange combo). 

I wouldnt pay the prices they expect for the main courses. Probably wouldnt come back because it was so unmemorable as a foodie experience overall."}
{"text":"We had frequented this place a number of times over the past couple of years, but it has recently had a change of ownership - and it is for the worst. We would actually entirely avoid it - which says a lot having a severely Celiac girlfriend - if it weren't for Snowman's Top Hat Ale on tap. If you haven't tried it, it's amazing, AND Celiac's don't often get to have a pint of draught beer so it's a win win. The atmosphere has improved, the food has gone from impressive to just ok - at best, and the service isn't horrible but can be kind of awkward at times. Check it out for a pitcher of Snowman, but otherwise don't bother."}
{"text":"For those of you in search of place to eat that's gluten free but doesn't mean a non gluten free companion would be stuck eating salad and cardboard bread, might I suggest this place?

I'm neither a celiac or a vegetarian so it was nice to see that there was meat on the menu and a variety of Americana inspired dishes.  In other words,  I ordered the steak sandwich with fries and was satisfied.

What took me by surprise was the bread!  My god! Gluten free or not it was freakin tasty!!!  

The only thing I would have to say about our dishes (the soup and our sandwiches)  is it was a little weak on flavour or at least salt.  Easily alleviated by asking for some.  

The coffee was better than average but not the best restaurant coffee I've had.  It doesn't impede me from ordering it again.  It is the kind of coffee I would have with eggs, hash-browns and bacon,

The atmosphere is comfortable, clean and unpretentious.  Our host one of the owners was a wonderful.  He was genuinely concerned about our thoughts on our meal.  He, too, a celiac wanting to help those in search of a place to just order food off the menu like everyone else.

His job was the toughest, host, server and cook.  This made it a little difficult at times when you wanted to ask a question or just ask for something else.

 I highly recommend this place.  It has so much for going for it not just it's food but it's location, Kensington market.  In addition, if you know someone with celiac disease - so far this remains high up on the list of must go places."}
{"text":"During a lazy Saturday afternoon stroll through Kensington, my partner and I spied a sign that said \"11$ pitcher of mojitos\". We immediately agreed that we DO WANT so we took a seat on the colourful and intimate patio of Kensington Cornerstone. 2 hours, 3 pitchers of mojitos and a delicious gluten-free dinner later, we were both big fans of this place. The mojito pitchers  were light (not syrupy sweet), and contained plenty of fresh mint leaves. While neither of us have a gluten intolerance, you'd never miss wheat in the food at Kensington Cornerstone. I had a rare, melt-in-your-mouth steak, with feel-good cheddar cheese and bacon mashed potatoes (the highest priced entree at $22). For dessert we had homemade chocolate banana frangelico ice cream. 3$ for a healthy portion.

We also noticed that they serve a lot of other tasty mixed drinks in incredibly cheap pitchers-- like hard peach lemonade or spicy caesars for 10 bucks a pitcher. Try getting one non-standard mixed drink for less at most places! 

While I don't have many food allergies, I know so many people that do, and it's nice to know I could suggest Kensington Cornerstone for dinner and know that my gluten-free friends could eat anything on their delicious, well priced menu without a second thought. Our waiter mentioned that the kitchen will also accommodate other allergies, so just speak up and KC will sort you out!

I highly recommend checking this place out, if only for the cheap, delicious drink pitchers. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Perfect for those avoiding gluten, or those that are just looking for a treat! 

While the menu selection is small, the food they have are delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwich which came with soup, and both were wonderfully savory, and the best part is that the bread (gluten free) tastes just like regular bread! However, I'd have to say that the best thing in the restaurant has to be their chicken fingers, I sincerely believe they have one of the best chicken fingers + dipping sauce in the GTA, and considering there's not drop of bread crumbs is pretty amazing!

The decor and service is devoid of complaint, it's a very hipster place and the servers are very lovely. Now the only downside I can see is their price, it does run on the high end and some of the portions are very small such as the $10 chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I wandered in here EXHAUSTED after a long day of vintage shopping and breathlessly ordered a poutine. I managed to ask if there was any \"wheat or thickening agents\" in the fries or gravy, because I had no idea this place offered a completely gluten-free menu, and a stupid number of people still don't know what \"gluten\" is. The server then uttered the most beautiful words: \"Isn't that why you're here?\" Quelle belle surprise!

I switched my order to the fried calamari, which ended up being $13 after taxes. Within five minutes, I got about 15 pieces of fried calamari with tartar sauce and some greens. It wasn't very filling. $13? Really? I know gluten-free flours are more expensive, but don't you guys buy in bulk? C'mon.

The food was good, but I'm on a Kensington budget, friends. You guys need to adapt to your environment."}
{"text":"Perhaps, I would have rated the restaurant higher if we were able to taste the food.  I was at the Kensington Market on Friday with my daughter and her friends, we had already ate lunch but we thought we would grab some food for later.  I follow a vegatarian gluten-free diet and was excited to try this place. I inquired of the server if they had take-out and one would have thought I had asked for some completely foreign concept, the server acted as if I was nuts.  I understand that some restaurants do not offer take-out and that is fine but just say that, don't cop an attitude.  Next, I asked if they took US money (I had spent the Canadian money I had exchanged and only had US dollars on me) and I was told \"no\"...which is their choice but then the sever added \"you are in Canada\".  Really!  So, I handed him back the menu and we left.  My suggestion, lose the attitude.  No amount of excellent quality food can make up for crappy service!  There are plenty of restaurants that offer gluten free options in Toronto and they are welcoming!  I travel to Toronto approximately every three months from Ohio, it will be interesting to see if The Kensington Cornerstone is in business in June."}
{"text":"I walked in because I passed people on the sidewalk just outside the KCR, and saw a brownie in their hand that made my belly want one... I am a chocolate addict and kind of a brownie fanatic too.... So, when I came in the barstaff/waiter/service attendant seemed fairly happy... perhaps because I passed this place and then proceeded to turn around and then go in and he was outside when I passed it and saw me.

There was something unflowy about our communication- choppy is the term... that's fine, it was what it was... The brownie... was really tiny for a $3.10 brownie, but it came with this amaZing raspberry compote, which almost compensated for the size of the brownie and it was so delicious. I was kinda desperate to try my brownie right away, since I was hungry. It was not heated up and didn't taste that great. but by the time I got home to warm it up, there was but a bite left... and heated up with the compote it was really, really good, like a 3/5. Maybe not worth the $3.10 I paid for it, yet tasty nonetheless.

It seems rather blunt to write off this place, based solely on a brownie purchase, yet I always pass it and the KCR has intrigued me enough to check it out.

Maybe next time I'll try an actual meal."}
{"text":"I have Celiac Disease and when I travel I tend to do a lot of research about gluten free friendly places to eat. After finding The Kensington Market's website, I was eager to try them.

My husband and I dined for dinner. I ordered fish and chips, and he ordered a Candiana Burger with a side of poutine. My meal was really good- the fish was light and not greasy. My husband's burger bun was one of the best gluten free buns I've ever tried. He's had his fair share of gluten free goods that left a bad taste in his mouth. I really enjoyed trying the poutine- gravy is traditionally made with wheat flour, so this is likely the only chance I'll ever have to sample local cuisine. 

Our server recommended we come back for the waffle brunch on Sunday and we did. Before this visit, I couldn't remember what a good waffle tasted like. It was really, really good. I don't really have any other words for it. 

This place is a safe haven for those with gluten allergies or celiac disease. The food is a real treat!"}
{"text":"Great job - for the fact that it's gluten free and the low cost.

Service is great, atmosphere is nice. Interior is interesting with all the piped glass. It's cozy. 

I think they could work just a touch more on the execution of their food and cooking it right. Otherwise, it's very tasty."}
{"text":"Move over Aunt Jemima.  I just found the perfect pancake.  It's not just any pancake.  It's gluten-free and doesn't taste like cardboard.  There's more to offer at this celiac-friendly restaurant.  

Who doesn't enjoy a good weekend brunch?  Very few would turn down a hearty breakfast after a long week.   I've walked by this place at least 50 times and somehow its existence escaped me.  It was during my research process for gluten-free restaurants that Kensington Cornerstone was discovered.

At first glance, their menu looks familiar with your average American restaurant fare - sandwiches, entrees, appetizers and brunch.  Read a little further and you'll realize it's not average at all.  Boldly printed at the bottom of the menu are the words that sold me - \"Entire menu is gluten-free\".  

Brunch spots have fallen off my radar since this Elimination Diet started.  I'd be longing for pancakes, french toast, yogurt and granola (everything I can't have) yet settling for eggs.  Just eggs.  Life changed for me this weekend - I realized I can still enjoy a real brunch.    I inquired about the inspiration behind the GF menu and learned that the chef and owner is celiac.  He struggled with restaurant options in the city and solved for it by opening up his own place.

OUR ORDER:

With brunch comes the recurring dilemma...pancakes or eggs?  I'm always torn between the two and am forced to sacrifice, choosing just one.  Kensington Cornerstone solves this problem (and breaks the breakfast rules) in what they call the Breakfast Bowl. 

Signature Breakfast Bowl ($13) 

The combination sounds bizarre so brace yourself.  This bowl is layered with vegetables (spinach and mixed bell peppers), potato hash, mini pancakes AND 2 eggs done any way you like.  The sorghum pancakes were something else.  Perfect size, texture and quantity so you avoid suffering from carb overload.  They are sweetened with a maple butter (not dairy-free) which is to die for.  You can expect the syrup to find its way to the bottom of the bowl and intermingle with your vegetables and potato mash.   This is intentional, albeit may not be acceptable to some.   All in all, you get the best of both worlds with the Breakfast Bowl.   


Garden Vegetable Omelette Souffle ($10)

If you find it offensive when your peas and carrots touch on your plate, then I'd play it safe and go for one of their traditional breakfast dishes.  Or give this a go.   Three eggs baked with cheese, green peppers, onions, ham (we customized the toppings, so I'm assuming you can too!).  It really is an omelette served in a deep dish, but souffle rolls off the tongue much nicer.   The souffle is complemented with a side of fresh fruit, CRISPY bacon (yum) and potato hash."}
{"text":"Finally!

It sounds pretentious, but people without food allergies take dining out for granted. Gluten is in more products than the public realizes, and even a small bite is enough to start a reaction, and contamination is one of the most common problems when dining out. More often than not, dining out becomes a gauntlet of pain and annoyance for celiacs. It's really taken the spontaneousness out of dining for me, and I'm sure many others.

So having a dedicated Gluten Free restaurant brings me peace of mind that is generally absent from all post-diagnosis dining. It's like it was before: I can walk in and I actually have a choice in my meal and drinks - That has never happened before!

I was there with friends on the weekend. The service was great, and I almost wept at the thought of having pancakes ($9) again - I'd given up hope that I'd be able to have a decent pancake again in my life. But these were good! Served with fresh butter and syrup, it was a revelation!  I also ordered an egg, and it was cooked perfectly.

Considering the higher costs of GF ingredients, they seem to focus more on quality produce and mindful portions -  the three of us were all pleased with the cost and portion sizes. I don't mind paying a bit more for peace of mind, let alone a selection of beer!

I can understand why non GF get frustrated or don't understand why the city needs a place like this, but it's a haven for those who just want to have the same things as anyone else: a carefree night out with as much choice as the next guy.

I cannot wait for patio season!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, hard to believe the entire menu is gluten-free. Service was excellent, the patio is great and there's a nice selection of beer."}
{"text":"I have only been here for brunch, but the whole thing was sub-par. I feel this review is going to be a little harsh, so I will definitely come back for dinner with a gluten-free friend and update this bad boy if they deserve it. Let's dive in:

Their \"big breakfast\" is small and $13. Say what?! Their bacon potato hash is pretty strange and over spiced. Not as in hot and spicy (which is actually pretty bad ass on breakfast potatoes) but as in \"look how much oregano, rosemary and dried parsley we can throw on these!\" Sometimes less is more, folks.

I had the Cornerstone Poached Eggs. They were OK, but, nothing to write home about. And $14 for a small breakfast? Where do you get off charging that in Kensington? We can look around. We know what your ingredients cost. Get real. 

Nice big patio, and very fun colours and decor. Not all bad, but... Not. Good. 

PEPPER POINTS: For rockin' the gluten-free menu. Gluten allergies aren't made to be messed with, and this place is a gluten-free zone without making non G-free-ers feel like they are lacking in edible menu options. They even have gluten free beer! This being said, I will only return when I am with a G-free pal."}
