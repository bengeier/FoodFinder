{"text":"This was my first time trying Egyptian food and it was amazing! Came here with my whole family after a long day exploring Montreal and everybody agreed on how delicious the food was. The most memorable for me were the falafel (vegan option for sister- very yummy, especially with the sauce) and the Hawawshi (so dang amazing, my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. The minced beef was spiced to perfection and the flatbread was nice and crunchy. Each bite was happiness.)
The service was very prompt as well. The server was very nice and answered all of our questions with patience and thoughtfulness.

I will definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Now let me start off by saying my family and I are very open to different foods. But I can honestly say we are all in agreement in that this was the WORST food we had ever had!!! I cannot remember having a meal as bad at this from the food to service. 

We came to find ourselves at this restaurant during a trip to Montreal. After a long day of biking and sightseeing we were looking forward to a nice ethnic dinner and after seeing the reviews we assumed this would be the place. We were sorely mistaken. First the service was horrible we waited ten minutes for water. Water that was room temperature, no ice at all. Then we had to wait another ten minutes for our order to be taken an order that was completely wrong. The owner did say his waitress was on vacation but quite honestly it was his waitress, cook and his manners and hospitality. The first thing we ordered Baba Ghanouj came out as the salad mix an error he made from not writing it down. This salad mix was horrible the vegetables were so vinegary they were inedible and spit out immediately. The baba ghanouj and tahini that came with it were equally as bad. The pita that came with it was straight from a bag not even heated. And it tasted like paper. At this point we should have left.

Then the entrees appeared and not at once. First the koshary. The chickpeas were undercooked and hard  and overall flavors were not there at all I barely ate 5 bites. Our other entrees include Molokhya which was dry and tasted like it was cooked in a microwave. And two orders of fetat Shawarma which there is nothing to say about but that it was awful. 

When he came back to clear our plates and saw our food was hardly touched. We told him we did not like it. Yet unlike at any other restraurant with courteous service he did not offer to comp us or ask if we want something else but instead made us pay the way overpriced total for the horrible food. Now I'm not the type to ask for free things but I honestly feel cheated. This was the worse food of my life.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ANYWHERE ELSE. I signed up for Yelp just to post this review. I feel that passionately about this place. If it was possible to give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Very good food, my friend and I went based on the reviews, sat on the patio and enjoyed a nice lunch.  I enjoyed the basterma and eggs and my friend and I enjoyed the babganouj as an appetizer. 
Will go back."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a conference. Found this place while searching for a vegetarian dinner that wasn't lettuce-based. Now, despite living in Brooklyn, I've never had Egyptian food so I wasn't sure what to expect.

It was very quiet when I went in. Everything is from Egypt, there's even a little streetcart thing. The owner is very friendly and welcoming without being intrusive.

 The koshary was delicious; it's not much to look at but the flavors really meld nicely. I'm particularly fond of the fried onions but I only wish it came with a little bit more tomato sauce. Also, the small portion is actually rather large. If you're planning on eating other things I would suggest splitting it with someone. (Or you could just eat everything and go take a nap)

The falafel was also pretty good. 

If I ever find myself back in Montreal, I'll be sure to stop by. I want to check out the foul and babaghanoush."}
{"text":"A big disappointment!! After reading reviews here I was expecting one of a kind dining experience but was quickly let down with the arrival of appetizer and everything else that followed. The food was tasteless, bland and very greasy. The only thing I enjoyed was the water. I will give them 1 star for good service. Very nice and polite but sorry won't make up for the lousy food."}
{"text":"Great Egyptian food, the menu could be less carb heavy. Ordered the fried eggplant and bachemel, was not complaining."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after finding our original destination closed and I am so glad we did. We had the Favas original, the kosher and the mousaka. Everything was delicious and the owner gave us tips on how the dishes were to be eaten. \"It's very important to mix the favas,\" he said. I found his concern charming. There are lots of vegetarian options, if that's a concern and I thought the prices for the dishes were very fair."}
{"text":"I've only been to Egypt once and eaten the food there a few times, so I'm can only review from a westerner perspective.  I thought the price was very good.  The food I had was good, but not overwhelming. I had koshary and karkadei.  The main dish was an interesting mix of rice, grains, macaroni, and spaghetti noodles, topped with sauce and fried onions.  I thought the drink was a little on the sweet side.  Perhaps if I tried some other dishes, I could learn to appreciate this place a little more.  For a 3 day stay in Montreal, this probably wouldn't be one of my can't-miss food options."}
{"text":"If you want a taste from Egypt in Montreal then this is my go to place .. Love the Kushari, the molokeya and macaroni in béchamel sauce .. Along with the pickled eggplants and even their deserts.. And the owner Albert welcomes u always with a smile and his undeniable Egyptian sense of humour .."}
{"text":"I went to this gem for an affordable bite to eat and was extremely satisfied with the service and simplistic yet delightful cuisine. The falafel is done the Egyptian way with fresh vegetables and has a nice, crunchy exterior. Also, the host/waiter/chef handles everything himself which makes it feel as though you are eating in his home.  The decor is thoughtful with a bright sheet above our heads and colorful placemats. Finally, the place is extremely affordable yet does not slip in quality.  My girlfriend and I had an appitizer, two sodas and and entree each and the total price was under 20 dollars! I highly recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Came here based on a Yelp recommendation. Very glad I did. The food is unique and authentic.  The drinks, salads, and entrees all featured items I've never heard of, and loved. Picky eaters and adventurous foodies will find something they love here. Try the Omm Aly for dessert. It's like a mix between custard, rice pudding, and crême brulée."}
{"text":"À few nights ago I went for dinner with a bunch of friends to walk down memory lane with Egyptian food. 
I had koshary which was super filling and enough for one person. I also had kebda eskandarany which was delicious, if you like liver this side dish is great. I also had some falafel and tahina which were great too. 

I hope they expand their menu to have warab 3enab (vine leaves) and mahashi stuffed vegetables. But besides that the prices were great and the service was great definitely a place you should visit to eat good Egyptian food."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp & love to try ethnic food and never had Egyptian food before. Great service, delicious, flavorful, fresh love the spices. Loved the fava beans shared kosher tried the table sauces  (yum) smoky baba garnish, pickles
Nice hibiscus tea. We'll be back."}
{"text":"\"We doing big pimpin', we spending cheese, Check 'em out now, big pimping on B.L.A.D.'s, We doing big pimpin' up in N.Y.C It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B\"...

Street poetry of \" Big Pimpin'\", the headline track of S. Carter's Volume 3, a timeless tune featuring Jay-Z and UGK that is guaranteed to get the floor movin' whenever the DJ drops it hot.  What most people don't know is that the playful, upbeat hook is sampled from an Egyptian song (Khosara - loss), and the artist (Abdel Halim Hafez) is the original OG big pimpin' in Cairo.   You'll no doubt see his original pimp-ness hung up on the walls of La Folie du Koshary along with the portraits of other famous Egyptians.  What is an Egyptian restaurant doing in Montreal, and most importantly, what is Kushary?  

To hear it from Albert (the owner), he's an engineer by training, Canada needs engineers, so he got the nod to immigrate there (he won't get that courtesy in the Trumpian States)  He was willing to learn French to work in Quebec (because you know, SNC Lavalin, Bombardier and all those other engineering firms there) and somehow, when he got to Montreal, they weren't hiring too many engineers.  Oh well, he used to work in restaurants in Egypt, so once he's in Montreal he saw the Amirs, Bashas and Boustans pushing Lebanese, and the Iraqi bakery on Lincoln Street doing Middle Eastern pastries...then he thought...why not Egyptian?  He rolled the dice and the restaurant is born.  

As for Kushary, it's a street food born out of well, being broke.   The name comes from Khichdi, which is an Indian food made out of lentils and rice, but in Egypt, they add pasta (plentiful), canned tomato sauce flavored with cumin (seems more like an Italian touch), chickpeas (pretty much a pan-Arab food originating from the Euphrates), garlic vinegar (very Egyptian) and fried up onions (also very Egyptian, they love their Allium).  To that you mix in their blend of hot sauce, which features piquant and fruity Aleppo peppers, which lends to it a smoky essence.   What you end up with is a massive mix of savory carbs that are fundementally vegetarian and works quite well in Montreal's cold weather to power you through mounds of snow.   

Now, Albert's Kushary features vermicelli (which tastes a bit like instant ramen noodles), elbow macaroni, lentils, chickpeas, rice, tomato sauce, and spices (definitely a cumin hit).  At each table there is a bottle of garlic vinegar and Frank's red hot, which is what the Koreans give to their kids as mouthwash, it's about as mild as sriracha and even more boring.   Just do yourself a favor and ask for the good stuff, and add...sparingly.  Toss and enjoy.  In terms of flavor, the chickpeas and lentils can be a little softer, and the pasta seems a bit limp (when I cook Kushary I usually pre-cook the pasta, drain in cold water to stop the cooking, add olive oil to keep them from sticking, use pre-cooked lentils and canned chickpeas, then toss in a warm metal bowl with piping hot steamed rice and tomato sauce to warm it back up), but the flavor is still very satisfying - I would consider this cuisine to have a good threshold for acceptance as it's so familiar in flavor to both Italian and middle eastern cuisine.  A portion for one here is good for one-and-a-half, and a portion for 2 is 2 meals for 2.  

Now, to wash down the Kushary you will want a tasty beverage, and I would recommend Khakharday.  If you have been to a Jamaican restaurant that serves Sorrel, or a Mexican restaurant that has aqua de Jamaica on their aquas frescas menu, that's the same thing - a chilled and sweetened hibiscus tea.  As for dessert, try the Om Ali, which is an Egyptian bread-pudding made with Phyllo dough, nuts, raisins and condensed milk baked in an oven until hot and crispy - Albert's version features a brulee top to lend a bit more flavor to it - once again, great for Montreal winters.

It's a cozy, inviting place with an interior furnished with items bought from Albert's former homeland, and features a nifty kushary stall similar to what you'll find all over the streets of Cairo.  Getting to the restaurant is easy as it's only down the block from the St. Matthews street exit on Metro Guy-Concordia (between de Maisonneuve and St. Catherines West) and across the street from the fire station No. 10.  I would definitely go back again the next time I visit Montreal - it's time someone give the Amirs, the Boustans and the Bashas a run for the money..."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. The owner was our server and could not be friendlier. The classic bean dish was awesome! We will have to come back here next time we are in town. I had the chicken dish and it was exactly what I wanted.
 Great food Good price. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We really needed a break from poutine, so we turned to yelp and found La Folie du Koshary.  My boy had never tried Egyptian food before and this sounded great, so we hopped on the metro and off we went.  

The place was much smaller than I had imagined, but it was a nice day, so we ate outside on the patio.  We both had the hawawshy which was tasted great spiced perfectly and it was served with \"Egyptian fries\" which were fries with seasoning. The server checked on us and even joked around with us.  Overall our experience and food here was a good one. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited by my Egyptian friend's recommendation. and he was right, now I am big fan of this Egyptian restaurant! Cozy atmosphere, delicious food, variety of menus(they show pictures of all menu in a big monitor, besides there is detailed explanation on menu), super friendly service, and its amazing price. I am very happy to add \"Koshary\" in my favorite snack list."}
{"text":"After hearing about the opening of this Egyptian restaurant, I had made it a mental note to come and pay this place a visit.

A close knit group of my friends and I popped in today, and after I spent some time trying to explain each dish to them, we decided to just go ahead and order a variety of appetizers and different main dishes so that we could try as much variety as possible (because anyone from an ethnic background knows that no matter how hard you try, some dishes are simply impossible to describe!).

We had 6 appetizers including baba ghanoush, pickled eggplant, moussaka, tahini, tomato with cheese, and koshary, and we were all impressed by the food. I can't speak for the eggplant based dishes because I am not an eggplant fan, however everyone else loved them.

The main dishes we had varied from different plates of foul (Egyptian style fava beans) to eggs with egyptian pastrami, and egyptian falafel. Again, we were all very impressed and definitely made it a point to taste every dish on the table.

After having some tea and dessert we asked for the bill to be split evenly amongst us (6 people) and were super surprised to find out that we only owed $18 per person....After all those appetizers, main dishes, dessert, tea, and 9 (yes, NINE) cans of pop, we only had to pay $18 each??? 

Not only was the food great and the prices even greater, but the restaurant itself has a charming vibe with great decor, pictures of iconic actors and singers on the walls, authentic furniture shipped in from Egypt, Egyptian music, and even Egyptian TV. 

All in all, 5 stars. For those of you looking for good, cheap, authentic Egyptian food, make sure to pop in here! And while you're at it, make sure to say hello to the super friendly Albert (the young entrepreneur who owns this restaurant). Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Be still my (foodie) heart! Egyptian food and its all delicious! I loved the koshary and the fava dish. The falafel was different and more delicious than all other falafels Ive had. The tea had an incredible strong and delicious flavor and when I asked, it is a blend that comes from Egypt. The owner even threw in special Egyptian bread (not pita) but was was perfect to soak up all of my scrumptious dishes."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. The bechamel is the Egyptian version of Mac & Cheese with ground meat, but the flavor was light years beyond the domestic version. Fried eggplant was greasy (the owner felt compelled to warn me about that) but that was a good thing: the skin was ultra crisp and the flesh was still light and cooked thoroughly (I hate undercooked eggplant--I mean, if you're going to serve it al dente don't bother, just toss it out and let us practice our corner kicks as it rolls by). The Egyptian falafel uses fava beans instead of chick peas, still great with tahini sauce. Topped off the meal with a dessert that is meant to be shared: a big warm biscuit with milk, cream, coconut, raisins, pistachios, and sugar, after baking in all of that it's a lot like bread pudding and is rich and sweet. The owner is a sweet man who took the time to translate the Arabic epigrams painted on the white walls which are also decorated with photos of famous Egyptian movie stars and musicians, one of whom no doubt was singing the background music during my meal. All in all good vittles for not much dargent. Overlooks the fire house across the street so don't be alarmed if there's a call while you're eating. Speaking of heat, if you like spice ask for the \"real\" hot sauce that he keeps in the back."}
{"text":"The food was great and the desserts even better! Totally recommend this place specially if you like authentic Egyptian food!"}
{"text":"Great find! I decided to check this place out because I had never tried Egyptian food before. Big fan of the Alexandria beans and the koshary, which is a dish with a bunch of grains (pasta, rice, lentils... I think. I might be remembering incorrectly) and really delicious fried onions. The pita bread was soft, chewy, and amazing. I also tried the Egyptian falafel, which is different in both taste and appearance (they're flat!). They were good too. 

The service was great. To echo the other reviewers here, the owner is super nice and welcoming. Our server was very attentive and refilled our waters without having to be asked, something I always appreciate. 

If you like delicious homestyle food in a casual setting, this is definitely a place worth checking out. Probably expect to spend between $5-15 depending on how much you order. The portion sizes are generous and the food is more filling than you think, so maybe come with a few friends."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! C'etait la premiere fois que je mangeais de l'égyptien et j'ai vraiment tripé ! Ce petit restaurant simple et peu dispendieux m'a fait tomber en amour avec le koshary! J'e  ai mangé pour souper et pour diner me lendemain ! 

Vous devez aussi absolument essayer le foie c'est une specialite la bas et il etait divin ! 

De plus, le service etait parfait ! Bref bellw petite place !"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and the hype is true.  The ambiance brings me back to Egypt.  I ordered the falafel sandwich which came out quick and was to die for. The falafel was crispy and full of flavor.  Also ordered the foul sandwich which was delicious and hearty.  If you're in the area you have to stop in.  Great quick service.  You will leave greatly satisfied and full."}
{"text":"My boo is Egyptian, but hasn't been to any Egyptian restaurants in Montreal. So after some research, I discovered this place and decided to surprise her with a little dinner date here. So after we got out of the Guy-Concordia Metro we walked about 1/4 block and SURPRISE!!! Safe to say she was excited. Egyptian restaurants seem hard to come by, the cuisine is mostly seen as comfort food or street food, so an actual sit down fine dining establishment is uncommon. Anyways, we walk inside and are greeted by Egyptian decor, tapestries, and aromas. I have her order since she's the expert. 

Koshary: The house specialty. Tasty carb overload! Delicious and filling. Probably can't eat one by yourself. The small plate still comes with a lot. 

Hawashy: My favorite. Bread stuffed with spiced meat and grilled. Served with fries. Definitely want more of that next time.

Egyptian Falafel (Taamia): Unlike most falafels that are made with chickpeas, Egyptian falafels are made with fava beans, which in my opinion taste better. These falafels were also more flat (instead of round), which allowed for more crispiness throughout. The coriander seed was also a nice touch. 

Tomato with cheese: cheese, tomatoes, mint & olive oil. Nothing special, though my boo enjoyed the nostalgia of it (well actually this applied for all the dishes). 

Aish Baladi Bread: Egyptian style bread that's kind of like a thicker, softer pita. Being that Egyptians invented bread, this was not an experience I took lightly.

Service was great when we first arrived cause there weren't that many people, but a few more folks started arriving and it took a quite a while to get our check and to-go boxes. I was a little taken back by the price (more than we expected), but we did order four plates. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating authentic, tasty and love-filled Middle-eastern cuisine. It's easy for me to know if the food is weak or spectacular because the only thing a restaurant needs to do is CARE. These guys respect you, your taste-buds and the food they prepare. Its real, its healthy and it tastes better than most restaurants in that area. Save this spot, you will rely on it quite often. Thank You guys!"}
{"text":"Trip 3: A small Egyptian restaurant near Guy-Concordia with very nice owners. We ordered Koshary, which is a traditional dish made of a mish-mash of rice, noodles, tomatoes sauce, fried onions, lentils, chickpeas. Good proportion, regular size is good for two people. It isn't the most amazing tasting dish but it is a interesting combination which should be tried. We also got a egg/hash beef dish with pita slices which was bland and unimpressive. Lastly a falafel pita which was oddly bitter, bland and poorly made. 

The food was definitely not what I expected as it was all bland and not well seasoned. As well there was not many meat dishes to choose from. It seems vegetarian friendly.

The redeeming aspect was the dessert which is called Umm Ali, a bread pudding with a sweet, milky, warm, mushy texture filled with raisins and pistachio. You should go just to try the dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing great koshary and hawawshi  I like it so much .
I'll come back to try their entire menu"}
{"text":"Tried the koshary, I was super curious after reading the reviews. It could be purely a matter of taste, but I find it's a bizarre concoction (rice, macaroni, brown lentils topped with deep fried onion, tomato sauce) and it really didn't sit well with me. Also tried the deep fried ground beef stuffed bread which came with french fries (unlike the salad displayed in the menu) and it was amazingly heavy and rather greasy. Service was very friendly, and decor was colourful and lively, but I can't eat the food."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at La Folie du Koshary. The food was really good, I had a classic foul beans sandwich and got to try their falafels too. Moreover, the owner was super friendly and conversant. He explained everything I was unclear about and made the customer service superb. I really loved to cozy atmosphere of the place too. Definitely will revisit, since it's super near Concordia as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here recently. It was our second time having Egyptian food and it was great!

I had the Koshary ($8.50), my husband had the Hawawshy ($11.99) and then we shared the Omm Aly for dessert ($5.99).

The Koshary was great. It was macaroni, spaghetti, rice, lentils and chickpeas in a tomato sauce then topped with deep fried onions. The tomato sauce had really good flavours to it. I think it had cinnamon, nutmeg and/or allspice in it. My only complaint with this dish is that it was a little too greasy/oily for me due to all the fried onions. It was delicious though, it just felt really heavy with so much carbs and fat. My husband also liked the Koshary. He said the taste was interesting.

My husband's Hawawshy was also good, but it was way too greasy/oily for me. It was ground beef inside a flat bread. I'm not sure if it was pan-fried or baked but it was so greasy. The flavour was good. If they can tone down the grease, this dish would be awesome. The fries were really good. They were crispy shoestring fries dusted with a spicy seasoning. We both loved the fries. My husband agreed that the Hawawshy was far too greasy. 

The star of the meal though, was the Omm Aly. It is either phyllo pastry or puff pastry soaked in milk with sugar, pistachio nuts and raisins, then baked. The pastry pretty much disintegrates into this creamy mass. The top gets all crispy and it was heavenly. If I wasn't afraid of becoming 700 pounds with clogged arteries and diabetes, I would eat 3 of these a day. It was so rich and creamy and delicious. We didn't finish it because we were so full and despite having stayed in a hotel without a fridge we still took it to go and I ate the rest later that night. My suggestion to the restaurant would be to sell smaller portions of this in addition to the large portion, so people who just want a bite can order a small portion.

Service was excellent. The lady serving us was very nice. I had some questions about the ingredients of the dishes due to allergies and she called the owner to ask him and even had me talk to him on the phone to make sure.  He was really nice too.

The restaurant is decorated with Egyptian items. There are pictures of famous Egyptian people on the walls. There is some fabric draped on the ceiling so it feels like you are dining in a tent. It's pretty cool.

Overall, it was a very good dining experience!"}
{"text":"4 years later I still enjoy this place , other than the classics like koshary, foul and falafel , their om Ali is to die for and their fatta is one hell of a filling meal"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal! The menu is very extensive and the service is outstanding as well. For food choices, I highly recommend the Koshari and fried eggplant. I feel like I'm back in Egypt!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was visiting Montreal and looking for a quick place to eat close to where I was staying and this appeared on yelp with good ratings. I am Egyptian and rarely find any good Egyptian restaurants, if any, outside Egypt so I was obviously intrigued. I only tried the koshari and it was really good. The regular size was already so filling. What I especially like about the place is the whole atmosphere. It has the typical Egyptian wooden chairs, the tablecloths etc. It feels like an authentic Egyptian koshari place, not even the fancier ones that even opened in Egypt now. Everything feels so homey and Egyptian, even the way they serve the typical tea with mint.The owner is also very friendly."}
{"text":"The only 2 questions that matter are: \"Would I come back?\" and \"Why/why not?\"

I would come back, and here's why.

The setting:
Conveniently located, La Folie du Koshary is just steps away from Concordia. It can be slightly hard to spot though, if you don't know what you're looking for. As for the interior, I'll invite you to check out their gallery on their website, as my words won't do it justice. But for the lazy people out there, I'll try my best. 

The interior of the restaurant took me on a little trip to an exotic universe. Picture this, you step inside and the first thing you notice is the tastefully decorated Arabic decor. It's gorgeous, warm and cozy; basically you feel as if you were in Egypt. The ambiance also had an intimate vibe to it, probably due to the fact that the owner brought all the furniture (chair, table, as well as that food cart on your left) from Egypt.

The food: 
We ordered some koshary, hawashy and falafel. As for dessert, we omm aly. 

With the exception of the omm aly, I would say the food was slightly on the greasy side, although I cannot deny how comforting and how satisfying the meal was. It's absolutely perfect if you've had a few drinks beforehand. I've never had Egyptian food before, and was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful it was. I was particularly impressed with the falafel. They were oh so crispy on the outside and tender on the inside that it was a joy to bite into them. Flavor wise, I felt that they were on par with your usual falafel served at Boustan, but the texture made all the difference. 

The omm aly was pure heaven. It reminded me of crème brulée and custard tart. It's been a few days and I'm still salivating over it. The texture was definitely interesting : it was crispy on top, mushy and custardy on the inside, and chewy thanks to the occassional raisins. Its portion size was reasonable, but I sincerely wished they offered this in a larger portion : I simply couldn't get enough of it. 

The service:
To someone who knew nothing about Egyptian food/culture, the menu was a little bit confusing at first, and I wished there would be more pictures on the menu. But then, the waiter soon came to our table, and took his time to describe the different kinds of food the restaurant was famous for. He told us about the origins of \"koshary\" and about the difference between a normal falafel and an Egyptian falafel (the former are made with chickpeas while the latter are made with fava beans); his stories stimulated our appetites and we couldn't wait to have a taste of Egyptian cuisine. 

While we were waiting for the food (which was quite fast, actually), he told us about the origin of the furniture and showed us the food cart that street vendors would use to sell street food back in Egypt. We had an amazing customer experience thanks to him!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is all authentic and makes you feel like you are in Egypt. I highly recommend this place and will be coming back. The service is wonderful and friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My sister and my boyfriend came by last night after searching for vegetarian friendly restaurants in Montreal (on Yelp of course!), and we found La Folie du Koshary close by. It was packed when we went in (mainly because there was a large family occupying two large tables. We were a bit confused when no one greeted us, but turns out there was only one waiter serving the whole restaurant, and he was tucked in the back with a customer paying a bill. Originally we were told the place was full, but he did offer us a small table in the end. A bit crammed, but bearable. 

Good: The falafels are amazing! So much better and lighter than the Arabic style ones. I've really enjoyed the Mesakaa, mainly because I love eggplants, so I could've eaten three of those. The pita portions were very generous to share among three people. The space is definitely cozy, not the most fancy of decor, but it felt authentic. 

Bad: I was not a fan of the Koshary because it kinda reminds me of leftovers assembled together...it was just carbs galore and a bit short on the sauces. I guess in pictures it looked a lot better, but it really didn't do much for me. I don't hate it, but I didn't quite enjoy it either.

Bottom line: The food is good and inexpensive, kind of what you would expect from restaurants in the Concordia area."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars, that's probably what I would rate it. I don't think I've had Egyptian food before, so really didn't have anything to compare it to. Came here with some family while in town. Of course we ordered some Koshary but I personally found it to be a little bit bland. Everything else was okay as well. Service wasn't overly friendly either. Just a very meh experience for me."}
{"text":"Great food and lot of vegetarian options.

Some of the items are a bit oily though - however that is the case for many other places."}
{"text":"The falafel here is great. The service was friendly  except for rushing us out early to pay. It was nicely decorated. My boyfriend didn't like his dinner as much."}
{"text":"I must say, it's been a long time since I've had such an eye opening and educational experience at a restaurant. Maybe the only time, actually. 
I was and still am pretty surprised that my boyfriend and I were the only ones in this place. 

I'll start by saying that I've never had Egyptian food before, and our more than amazing server (possibly the owner?) was enthusiastic and happy to answer all of our questions. He kindly explained the many dishes and made recommendations to the most popular ones. 

Of course we started with a plate of falafel, and then had two entrees that I unfortunately can't remember the name of.. but the food was fresh, hot and delicious. I tried the Turkish coffee and fell in love with it! It's the only coffee I've ever been able to drink black! Dessert was so good too!!

Our server explained how all of the decor in the restaurant was even brought over from Egypt, everything from the chairs and tables to the silver cups they serve water in. The walls have images of celebrities and people of importance from Egypt, and they even give every table a list of words translated from English to Arabic. It was fun to sit and learn the locals language while waiting for our food. It was almost like being in Egypt.. without the warm weather :( 

I could go on all day about the amazing aspects of this restaurant. Basically the only thing I didn't like was the grungy building they're located in, but they for sure did their best to make it their own cozy Egyptian getaway."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this. Got a chance to sit out on the balcoNY, good day good food. Had the bashamel and the koshary, both were good enjoyed the bashamel more though. Well priced good spot to check out if in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was great, we had eggs with corned beef, hawawshy, foul eskandarany, falafel, macaroni bashamel and a cold karkade drink (hibiscus) , everything was great and as authentic as you're gonna get. The owner was super nice and if it wasn't for us being full I would have kept on ordering to try everything. I will be going there again and again.  I would recommend it for brunch and breakfast , heck any time of the day."}
{"text":"I like to think of this place as a secret and hidden restaurant, I love discovering places like this ! As soon as I walked in, I felt carried away by the Egyptian authenticity and uniqueness ! The decoration and ambiance (greeting and courteous approach and music) gives me the impression that I've travelled to Egypt, the food and service is amazing, the owner is truly a kind person !Evidently I tried the Koshary, Egyptian falafel and lastly Omm Aly for dessert, it was exceptional ! Everything on the menu is homemade, rich in taste and with love, you most definitely taste it  I will be going back to try everything on the menu !"}
{"text":"This is by far the best koshary and hawawshi I tried in here in Montreal. There is not much restaurants the serves Egyptian food in montreal however this one took my appetite. I loved the fact that their koshary is like homemade and they offer the 'da2'aa' an the spicy sauce with it. I also liked their pickles Egyptian way, it is one of my favorite. I also ordered delivery from them and was as good as eating there."}
{"text":"Great service, tried koshary and falafel. Food was insanely good and the sauces were authentic. Definitely will go back. The ambiance is laid back and traditional. The owner is an awesome and very friendly person."}
{"text":"First time to eat here but won't be the Last. We had the Koshary, falafel, and baba ghanoush.  And definitely all were amazing. If you are in the area please don't let this place pass you by.  The people there are very welcoming. Can't wait to come back to Montreal to eat here again."}
{"text":"5 stars for the delicious kochary(coming from an Egyptian), for cleanliness, prices, for varieties of options and offerings and for the awesome staff! 
So happy to discover this great place! 
Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Hats off!!!! La Folie Du Koshary brings Koshary to Montreal. You don't have to travel to Egypt to taste. It tastes exactly as it is serves in Cairo streets. The owner is overlooking the details himself. Very clean, tasty and not expensive. I was not able to finish the \"regular\" plate. It was huge. 
And the best part, they deliver! Looking forward to try other dishes. 
Good job guys keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Montréal you did not disappoint with Egyptian fare. We were hungry for some shawarma and hummus. Popped open the Foodora ap and ordered from this wonderful place to have delivered to our hotel room.

Definitely try their shawarma plate. The fried pita crisps on the bottom were such a nice surprise when mixing all the ingredients together. 

Their hawawshy was dreamy! So tasty and filling. We will definitely come back the next time we see in Montréal!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and decided to go to Folie du koshary, its a typical Egyptian restaurant. Usually for middle eastern food you always find lebanese. So i asked the owner the reccomand us a few items,  we were a group of 5 and were able to try different dishes. We Started with falafel, wow, they were hot and crispy very different than the usual mushy falafel you find in other restaurant, the we had the Koshary (rice with lentil with some macaronies topped with fried onions and a garliky tomato sauce) we all loved it,  the mix of flavors makes you want to eat more. The decor in itself is very basic, its more a cafeteria look,  there is a real Egyptian street food cart that the owner brought From there. A must try ."}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the good yelps. It's a familly run place and all the food is made with love. The koshary is the specialty of the house and it is  combination of pasta
Fried onions chic peas in a piquant sauce. It was very nice. Also had the béchamel which was good too.
My take is this is Egyptian soul food. So come here for 
Lots food   cheap prices,and if your into it something a little out the ordinary."}
{"text":"A great find for vegans. Two of us split a large koshary, tahina appetizer, falafels, Egyptian balady bread,  karkeidh (hibiscus tea) and one (non vegan) had half an om aly for dessert. 

Everything, notably the service, was excellent. We were apprehensive because we knew nothing about Egyptian food but our server instantly put us at ease. 

The ambiance is a bit lacking, hence a reduced star, but the food and service are terrific."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit with the owner of La Folie du Koshary yesterday, and eat my first koshary, Egyptian falafel, and hibiscus juice. Full disclosure, the owner insisted on making my meal complimentary and I typically don't write a review in that case, but I just ate the leftovers and have told everyone I've seen since I discovered this place to go check it out, so I am confident my review is unbiased and really wanted to write it. This is perfect inexpensive, healthy, filling food. Koshary is a mix of amazing sauce, fried onions, lentils, rice and noodles - I had no idea but I could eat this every day. It's perfect student food tucked right near Concordia but a bit out of sight on a second floor on St Mathieu. Go find it, you'll thank me. This is authentic Egyptian street food and it's so so so good. The falafel are made fresh to order and they are nothing like the Lebanese kind that are easier to find here in Montreal. These are made with beans and veggies and herbs, light and crispy and green. 

Everything in the tiny chill resto was bright from Egypt - the chairs, the spices, the beautiful food cart... there are even posters on all the walls featuring great Egytian performers. I love the proud and thoughtful sharing of authentic history. Very cool, very cozy, crazy tasty. Thanks so much to Yelp Elite Noha for enthusiastically sending me to discover this spot!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident and decided to have a try. I was greeted by a very friendly lad who turned out to be the owner. He told me that the focus here is on Egyptian street food.
I have to say that I was very impressed by the decor, and even more so when I found out that everything from the chairs to the metal water cups were brought from Egypt.
I tried the falafel sandwich, the liver and some koshary. The falafel sandwich was my favourite, very flavourful and different than the Lebanese ones which are far more common. The liver dish was also tasty, but it feels to me more like a tapas dish to accompany drinks. The koshary, was a bit too heavy for me. I would enjoy a few spoonfuls of it for sure, but do note that with all the beans, pasta and fried onions, this dish is as heavy as a poutine.
I would come back, for the falafel."}
{"text":"C'était super pour une première fois dans un restaurant égyptien! Le serveur est une perle! Il nous a tellement bien conseillé et était toujours présent pour répondre à nos questions! Nous avons mangé comme des porcs (on a eu genre 2 lunchs) et tout goûtait tellement bon et différent de ce qu'on connaissait. 

Laissez-vous tenter par le foie! Je n'ai JAMAIS mangé un foie aussi bon !! C'était fouuuu! Sinon il vous faut essayé le plat typique, un genre de mélange de pâtes, riz, tomates, lentilles! Bref, c'est énorme, mais ça vaut la peine! Les falafels sont aussi une très belle découverte!

Je ne peux absolument pas vous dire si c'est vraiment les goûts typiques égyptiens, c'était ma première fois, mais je vous garantis que vous vous régalerez à vraiment très petits prix! Nous avons tout simplement adoré!

Merci!"}
{"text":"The food was nice.. But the place was crammed since we were a group.
Nevertheless, we had fun :) It was good and worth the money. The owner was friendly.
However, good options for vegans and vegetarians. Not so much for meat eaters sadly."}
{"text":"Endroit bien sympathique, bouffe à prix très modique, tout était délicieux et on a même osé le foie ! c'est le seul resto égyptien que j'ai essayé de ma vie, mais c'était une très belle expérience, service très courtois bref, j'y reviendrais volontier."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, spiced really well. Service was very friendly. It's hard to find Egyptian restaurants, so it's wonderful that this rare one is very good."}
{"text":"Egypt is a big country with memorable culinary touchstones that, for reasons beyond me, don't turn up very often in restaurants over here. Not that Montreal doesn't have healthy Eastern Mediterranean representation in its many Lebanese spots, but Egyptian food, not so much. When this mystery starts to grate on you, this restaurant is the solution. You will find extremely competent koshary, the Egyptian street food par excellence, consisting of lentils, chewy fried onions, rice, chickpeas, macaroni and angel hair-like pasta, all swaddled in warmly seasoned tomato sauce scented with cinnamon and allspice. There is venerable molokhiya, the national dish of stewed jute leaves and herbs -- the texture is a bit like okra, mucilaginous and pleasingly tart -- alongside rice and meat, in this case a generous roast quarter chicken. One of my companions, choosy about his ful medames, found it right up to Cairo standards. This is a reliable spot for essential Egyptian dishes done right at an attractive price."}
{"text":"Sitting on the restaurant's balcony on a Montreal summer day took me back to my visits to Egypt. The place is nostalgic, with photographs of Egyptian historic icons decorating its walls. My boyfriend and I, both partly Egyptian, came upon this little jem as a result of our own nostalgia for authentic Egyptian food, a taste of home. 
Nothing says Egypt like koshari, and that's what we ordered first: jumbo koshari ($12.99). It was delicious. Absolutely delicious. The topped crispy, fried onion screamed with flavor, waiting to uncover the rest of the dish beneath. It was the perfect blend between soft and crunchy. The service is excellent; food was served warm and in a timely manner, and the waiter refilled water almost as soon as our cups were empty. We also had the yogurt salad with cucumbers ($5.99), which helped balance the spiciness from the hawawshi ($12.99). While the hawawshi was much more oily and crunchy than we had hoped, it was nevertheless scrumptious."}
{"text":"Looking for a new restaurant to discover, we decided to have supper at La Folie du Koshary.
We sat on the terrace which was very good and quiet, and both hosts who provided us excellent service, brought us menu, left us enough time to see it, and explained very well what each dish contained. 
The menu is vast, and our choice stopped at Koshary and Hawawshi. The portions very generous (we took one Koshary for two) and the taste great! 

As for drinking choices, the water needed a bit of ice, since it was a bit too 'natural' to quench the thirst.....  we had Coke and Mango juice (a can and a bottle of the juice), but still a bit of ice in the water is not a bad idea....

In all we were delighted to discover Egyltian food, and also to be able to have a great time eating without being constantly asked if the food was good, or other interventions, as in other places....

We also saw that this place has take out. So if you want to discover new flavors, La Folie du Koshary will really be a great place to consider!!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out after reading an article on middle Eastern food. Then flipped over to Yelp and saw my friend Risa had checked it out with a few of the Yelp elite group...And all the reviews were good, so I stopped in. I went with a group of four to try more things and I have to say it was awesome. The decor is great and when I spoke to the owner he talked about how the street food culture in Egypt was the inspiration. All the dishes where really good and huge portions worth the price in value. It was very heavy meal but man was it delicious. Hot sauce and garlic sauce on every table makes it all come together with you level of preference. I suggest to go by and you will likely come back like me."}
{"text":"After visiting the museum of fine arts, my friend and I decided to stop by this quaint place for dinner after reading all of the positive reviews on yelp (yay!). 

When we entered, the place was pretty quiet, but beautifully decorated - apparently all the furniture and tableware comes from Egypt! I loved how they pasted pictures of famous Egyptians around the walls with a short bio for each - it really was like stepping into a different world. 

Both my friend and I had never had Egyptian food before, but our server was very patient and explained everything on the menu to us. I ordered the koshary and falafel sandwich, and both were extremely delicious and filling (seriously, I didn't feel hungry until the next morning). The karkadieh (hisbiscus drink) was very sweet, with a tinge of spice - a perfect addition to the meal. 

I definitely plan on returning to this place when I visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Had a koshari to take out. Shared it with other girls. They all like it probably because the spice in it was very unique and delicious. I wish it would have a bit more tomato sauce. 
Will come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious koshary and awesome service... And their taamias are on point !!! I also really enjoyed the beautiful decoration and the small Arabic-English lexicon that is provided on each table. It makes the visit enriching on both a cultural and a linguistic level!"}
{"text":"Five of us had lunch here, and it was delicious!  The owner/manger/server was friendly and highly competent.  The falafel was freshly prepared and both crunchy and moist.  Babaganouj was light but flavorful.  Alexandrian foul was interesting (topped with hummos and salad) and rich.  And, of course the koshary was delicious, and came with crispy onions and homemade sour (garlic and lime) and hot sauces.  Pickles were perfect accompaniment to meal.

The restaurant is a casual spot very close to Guy metro stop. Simple decor, furnishings and table settings.

One of the best meals we've had recently.  Would reccomend if you like other middle eastern food."}
{"text":"I regretted a lot to go to this small restaurent so late!! I lived nearby and I passed it hundreds of time but never went inside...I should've been there earlier! 
The service is sooooo good even it's a small restaurant with low price! When I had dinner, the waiter or probably owner too came and check twice if everything is ok. He is so nice! 
I ordered a meat pie and it tasted so gooooooood!
I will definitely go back again and taste other Egyptian dishes!!"}
{"text":"It's a small but a very cosy place, perfect if you want to grab a quick bite with friends or family.
They have a terrace which is perfect in summer. I'm definitely a new fan of Egyptian food."}
{"text":"This is a Mom and Pop Egyptian resto that we had all to ourselves (went early during Ramadan) for our entire visit, so it's odd that the only actual complaint we had was it was hard to get a check at the end. Now that's out of the way, I will gush: fantastic homestyle comfort food at a very reasonable price. The mini-Koshary was sufficient for an ample adult meal. The tomatoes in the pickled tomatoes were a bit out of season (it's early yet) but the spicing more than made up for it. The bechamel was an excellent in a casserole-style and also extremely generous for portions. The house salad had a little too much iceberg but the house dressing was an unusual yogurt-style. One of our party (picky kid) ordered scrambled eggs; they have lots of little things available a la carte so it's possible to piece together your own meal.  Guava and mango juice (and bottled ayran) if you want something more exotic to go with the meal, otherwise standard beverage service choices.

And, the appellation 'hole in the wall' may even be too much - this is nestled up on the second floor and one has to sort of wander through a small warren of stairs to get to the restaurant itself, which is decorated with a bright ceiling hanging and a cool painted wagon and the many photographs of Egyptian Ciné stars from the golden era of Egyptian film. Great fun and very good food for the price."}
{"text":"A cute resto in the middle of concordia area. The owners are very kind and you can see that they value customer services. 

The food is flavourful and fresh... And homemade - a key factor amongst the abundant student population in this area"}
{"text":"Not too shabby! The food is cheap, and the service is clean. It can be a bit slow, especially when busy, but the gentleman working there is very nice. The corned beef and egg wrap was just bleh, but the baba ganouj and falafels were pretty great! Overall, a must try; I'm going back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Very nice cozy place.  We tried the baba ganouj, falafels and molokya, which were excellent.  The staff was kind enough to offer us a sample of koshary, the quintessential Egyptian street food.  He says all the ingredients, utensils and even furniture are from Egypt.  Friendliness and hospitality made us feel like we were there!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for places like this. The cozy, homespun feel, coupled with authentic cuisine and friendly service make it impossible to resist. If I lived in the area, I'd be sure to become a regular.

My girlfriend and I accidentally ordered twice as much food as we could eat in one sitting; the pricing here is exceptionally low for the portion sizes. Having seen other reviews here, I was prepared for good food at a fair price, but I was surprised to see just how worthy Koshary was of its praise in this regard. Of the several items we ordered, the Egyptian style falafel was the must-have highlight. 

We spoke briefly with (who we assume to be) the owner as we prepared to leave, and it gave me the distinct impression that this is a business where the ownership genuinely cares about their business. The friendliness and concern for our satisfaction really won me over in a way that not many restaurants have. Koshary deserves your support, and I can assure you, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices!! I have been here a few times now and I love the food!!! Great place to relax and have a good meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place. As an Egyptian, I can confidently say it's the best Egyptian cuisine in Montreal. So authentic. I've pretty much tried everything there. Their Koushry is great and the Um Ali (an Egyptian dessert plate) is fantastic."}
{"text":"I am an Egyptian and I can confidently say that this is the one of the best Egyptian cuisine restaurants I have ever tried. I tried the Koshary jumbo plate, delicious!! I am a huge Koshary fan in Egypt and it tastes exactly similar to the legit Egyptian Koshary if not better. Hummus is outstanding too. The service is beyond excellent. Would definitely come again on my next visit to Montreal!!!"}
