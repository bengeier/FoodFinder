{"text":"I cannot stand having to go into this shop. I do because it is so close to my children's school and therefore really handy. The staff are so rude and unless you are polish you are treated like dirt. No smiles, no hello, no thank you, no have a nice day, ..nothing! So keep yur expectations REALLY LOW.  Customer service means nothing to them."}
{"text":"fresh! food, great prices, pleasant staff. nice place to stop in for a quick bite! i recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered take out over the phone and was berated for not calling a day earlier. I DID call a day earlier, but nobody answered the phone at Karpaty. \"What time did you call?\" The owner doesn't understand Western practice, ie benefit of doubt. She didn't believe me and was rude about having to cancel the order.  If you have strep throat and don't want to infect anybody how would you talk to your customer?  The owner was abrupt, barked that her chef doesn't work 24 hours (really!?) and then said, \"OK, BYE\" and hung up. Destroying customer relations for after I have been going there for years? Anybody know a good Polish Deli? I'm not returning."}
