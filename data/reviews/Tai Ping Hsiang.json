{"text":"Probably one of the worst take out place I have been to.  Based on the  reviews I wanted to give this place a shot.  I noticed the prices were fair and cheap, but it seems like either they bumped their prices from their menu or they are out to scam your money.   Service here is mediocre the employees seems so bitter and sad. I hope they get properly trained.       Will not be back."}
{"text":"Pop corn chicken was a fail. No basil leaves were added at all. Tastes like regular fried chicken."}
{"text":"Cost: Very reasonable - 90% Decor: Poor, think food court Quality: Very good (sampled multiple items) - 90% Value: 90% Keeper? 100% Yes, will go back, been there twice.  Food wise I gotta give it a 5 stars. Yes not enough tables or chairs, and yes long queue like what Archimedes useless review claimed (So what does a long queue tell you? Think! Easy answer in this context!).  For Taiwanese bento box, show me another place that's better than this and I will gladly take out one star."}
{"text":"I've been to this Taiwanese take-out five times 'cause it's pretty cheap, and it's just a fifteen minute walk from where I live.  I'd say if you haven't had Taiwanese popcorn chicken for the past four years, you'll love this place to death like I did years ago.  However, if you've been discovering and testing other Taiwanese food places on a regular basis, or if you eat out very often, then you'll probably give this place an OK like I do now.   The good stuff... A meal is usually just under $8 and it'll fill you up for lunch.  I'm 5'2 and 44kg, I don't know, sometimes I need to eat two of their bento boxes, so usually a meal is around $14 for me at this place, but then I get to eat six side dishes and two main courses.  XD  Sounds pretty cheap to me.   The cons... The main course and side dishes are MSG loaded, and makes you very thirst after devouring their bento box.  When you're young though, who cares right?  Second, the service can be a hit or miss.  The aunties're probably tired of asking what you want for your side dishes, so if you want to make their lives easier, just let them pick for you.  Oh holy, their kitchen is fillllthy though.   Overall, don't let my opinion deter you from going.  If you hear good things from other people and are curious, just go for it.  :)"}
{"text":"Got the spicy fried chicken this time. Addicted now. Probably bad for my health. :/"}
{"text":"I've been working in this plaza for almost 5 years and yesterday was my first time heading into this place. My coworkers often get the combos for lunch so I finally decided to check this place out myself.   The place is small, with very limited seating but seems like most people do takeout anyway. I ordered a side order of popcorn chicken to go. Surprisingly for 5.55 (6.25 after tax) there was a large amount of popcorn chicken, which almost seemed endless when I was eating and sharing with a few friends.   The popcorn chicken was fresh outta the fryer, not too salty nor greasy, and seasoned just right with 5 spice powder. A delicious non healthy snack that I'll be sure to come back for!"}
{"text":"Tai Ping Hsiang is located among many other quick fast-food style restaurants in Metro Square off Steeles Ave in Markham.  There are dumpling houses, Korean spots, Asian legend, bubble tea spots, Hong Kong style cafes, chinese bakeries, and then... there is Tai Ping Hsiang.  It specializes in bento box meals, and their signature is their Taiwanese style popcorn chicken. The place can get hectic I find, at all times of the day. The workers speak very little english, and the organization of the place can be confusing at first. When you walk in, there is a menu on the wall and a cashier. However, you are supposed to walk all the way to the back where the fridge is, order your food, wait for it to come out of the back kitchen, and then pay last.   The popcorn chicken is delicious (6.50). Seasoned and marinated in chinese spices, crispy, but surprisingly not greasy. The snack size comes in a paper bag with skewers for sharing. Or you can pay an extra 0.75 and get a meal with white rice and 3 side dishes. I recommend the sweet potato, green beans, and tomato and scrambled egg.  Check this place out! Better for take out, as there are only 2 small tables."}
{"text":"This is not a sit-down place. There are no seats so it's only takeout. The food is cheap for the amount and variety you get. The food is decent for the price you pay, but most of the time it can be too salty. If you want quick, fillingTaiwanese food, this is exactly where you want to go."}
{"text":"Lunch or dinner combo under 10$ with a pop or soup. Can't get better the bbq pork and popcorn chicken here is best in town.  Parking here is terrible during lunch time and there's limited seating so be prepared to take out"}
{"text":"Good food, not big on service, but you don't come here for that. You come here for a fast, in-and-out, grab and go Chinese bento boxes. Like I said in my review for Chin Yuan (inside the building in the food court), I basically split my visits between these two places. I like the fact that I can choose my sides, but if I know I'm going here, I make sure to get there early since the later you go, the less choices of sides you have. Sometimes lines can get a bit crazy, but they move fast. The food is authentic and tastes good; case in point, the popcorn chicken and deep fried pork chop. I definitely recommend this place for your quick Taiwanese food fix."}
{"text":"Freshly fried thick cut pork chop rice with the right amount of batter and your choice of 3 toppings, all for food court prices.  If you frequent this mall you know that there's stiff competition for Chinese and Taiwanese food here, but this place manages to survive while others fail.  Why?  They offer juicy thick cuts of meat, freshly made, and sides that are inspired and made with care.  It's that simple.  Other food court chains tend to take shortcuts with either the meat, veggies, rice, or all 3 and they only compete on price, but you can taste the difference in quality here.  I got a seat at one of the two tables there, and in my 15 minute meal noticed a huge line of people come and go with their takeout boxes.  It's no wonder why this place stays in business!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert in Taiwanese cuisine, but I know tasty, and this was both tasty and cheap!   A popcorn chicken bento box comes with rice, and 3 side selections, for about 8 bucks! They have a wide selection of side items, my favourites being the stir-fried lotus root, the stir-fried cabbage, and tomato-egg. The rice is soft and fresh, not day-old stuff that other Chinese restaurants serve. They have a decent menu to choose from but I'm such a fan of this popcorn chicken bento box that I haven't bothered to stray from it. They are so value-conscious that they don't even upcharge you on pop. Most places can charge up to $1.50 for a coke. Here it's under a buck.   Tips: - Line up to order in the back (by the fridge) - Pay for your items at the front register. - Lunch time gets super busy. - They have only a few tables, but they fill up fast. - Most suitable for take-out.  Good food, fast service, good price, deserves my business."}
{"text":"The food is ok but very poor service - sitting area has only 2 tables : take out is the only way...typical Taiwanese fast food with lots of side options : good flavours but again the poor front service makes me not want to come back - there are other options in the same plaza"}
{"text":"Came here today and experienced the worst service ever.. I waited 15 minutes at the front counter for some service when the place was not even busy.  three ladies  that work there chit chatting away with their backs towards me didn't  even budge when I  tried to get their attention. Soon they noticed me and they were incredibly rude. I asked them for the snack-size BBQ pig liver but they  rudely replied what is that?? Then I told them the number on the menu and they replied what is that, no we don't have that. just told me to look at the refrigerator.. .       when I wanted to pay , their attitude was so rude and they are once again taking their time literally I waited at the cashier area for so long I wanted to leave...  Because NO SERVICE!!   [!!!!!!They also charged me $7.05  for a small box of   duck tongue that's not even 100g.........!!!]   I don't get why is it so expensive for not even 100g of duck tongue.. rip off   Overall service is rude, slow , unhelpful and expensive, worst experience ever."}
{"text":"This is a small take out place with very limited seating so it might be wise to take the food to the Metro Square food court to eat while the food is still hot! I came here to try the Taiwanese popcorn chicken combo which includes three side dishes and the choice of a soup or soft drink.   Loved the popcorn chicken which was really tasty but not too greasy. The portion size is decent and would likely return when I get the popcorn chicken cravings again."}
{"text":"For about $7-8, you get a Taiwanese lunch box with a main meat dish, and your selection of side dishes (varies daily). How to order:   1) don't line up in front of the cashier, go to the side where the food is displayed and tell the lady which mest dish you want (I recommend the popcorn chicken or chicken leg)  2) pick your side dishes (i recommend the seaweed and eggplants if available)  3) pay at the cashier  4) eat  This place is really packed during lunch time and closes earlier than the food court."}
{"text":"Have been a regular customer for awhile. Right beside my office and you can get a good meal with your own choices of 3 side veggies. My favorite choice is their popcorn chicken! Prices have definitely increased since. Surprised the snack popcorn chicken costed 7 smthing! Would suggest opting for the meal that comes with rice and veggies to get a better value."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years. When they first opened, it was a fantastic place. I think the owners here have changed over the years, and it has been going downhill from there.   The food is just traditional lunch boxes where you can pick the \"protein\" and get three side dishes. The side dishes are fantastic, but I'm not a fan of the meat. Most of the time, it is just deep fired meat (pork or chicken) that everyone gets. I like the variety of the side dishes, but that's about it.   The service here is crap. I have rarely been to another location with such a shitty service level. You can be there for the first time and just stand there at the cash like an idiot because you don't know that you should proceed to the side to order first. Once you order, and line up at the cashier, the lady acts like you're her worst enemy and does't care if you don't get your food. I had the lady look down on a customer because she didn't have payment ready. When another customer was asking where her food was after paying, she just ignored her...Just a crappy place for service.   There really is nothing really good about this place. would only repeat if everyone else wanted to go for quick and cheap Taiwanese food or snacks.   Finally, one word of advice, they only take cash. As I rarely carry cash, I had to circle around afterwards because I had to withdraw money (or at least that is what the lady told me)"}
{"text":"Good Simple and Cheap   Not really much to say about this place that hasn't already been covered the food is good the portions are good as well, the place is simple 2 tables for dine in so most of the traffic is take out and the pricing is amazing.   Get the popcorn chicken, pick 3 side dishes grab a drink and you're out of the door spending less than $10 on a meal that could've costed you more. I was more than satisfied by the end of the meal and it didn't leave me feeling like I should've ate something healthier. Only suggestion for the place is maybe clean up a little here and there. ;)"}
{"text":"All I can say its this place is amazing!!! Probably the only place that serves traditional Taiwanese popcorn chicken!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Price keeps going up, but that's expected with inflation and the rising cost of groceries. Fried Chicken Nugget (aka popcorn chicken) combo was $6.65 three months ago, now $6.85.  That said the small price increase isn't a deal breaker, but the disappearance and replacement of side dishes with far inferior items might be (cost cutting). Please bring back green beans for dinner! *rant over*  This is a good place to satisfy your Taiwanese Popcorn chicken craving. And no, this is nothing like KFC's popcorn chicken (I've been asked)! You can get this in a combo (rice and sides) or by itself for a dollar less. However I've had better, just not as convenient."}
{"text":"One of the few Taiwanese places that serves yummy Taiwanese bento box. They used to have a few tables that allows for a quick sit down meal. Now, they are only for take out. And honestly, I find this is the better method.   When I walked in, I realized they have renovated a little. That looks better IMO. So I ordered the popcorn chicken with my assortment of side dishes. This was still how I remembered this place's offering. I need to purposely pay for extra side dishes, cause these are amazing! Will I come back? Yes I will."}
{"text":"Small place - good for ordering, eat and then get out quickly. The popcorn chicken was decent.  Side dishes were a bit on the salty and on the oily side.  Place is not the cleanest place in the world, but was decent for a fast food joint.  There were lots of people doing takeout (mostly ordering popcorn chicken).  Heard service wasn't the greatest, but from my one time experience, the staff was pretty nice.  Cash only."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for Taiwanese Popcorn chicken bento boxes!! It's pretty packed during lunch, but they move through the line pretty quickly.   The majority of employees speak Mandarin here, but if you order in Cantonese they still understand.   There is a big chart of protein you can choose. I haven't tried anything besides the popcorn chicken because it's just so yummy! They freshly fry it, with a good amount of seasoning and crispy exterior.  There is a fair amount of chicken per order.   Then you get to 3 sides.  There are so many to choose from.  I'm biased because I love eggplant, so I always get that one.  As another yelper mentioned, the fried sweet taro is really good! I have tried their green beans,  their lotus roots, their on choy, and tofu.  All are very good!   And you also get a bowl of soup, or upgrade to a can of pop for 6.65 plus taxes.    The only downside is that there is only 2 small tables to eat in. During lunch, I would head over to the food court, but even then it's sometimes hard to find a free table to sit at.   Great prices, great food and selection and pretty quick service."}
{"text":"Got smoked duck bento for $8.  Not too much protein.  Definitely smaller portion than the taiwanese competitor in the food court.  But you get to pick your own 3 sides.   Got my food in 2 min.  Very efficient. However, did not realize meal comes with free soup which i did not receive. First time back in 10 years.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I usually order the popcorn chicken rice and it never disappoints. It always come out fresh, hot, crispy, and flavourful. The best part is, it tastes like the ones I had in Taiwan so it is totally authentic. The bento comes with rice and 3 sides that you can choose from. All sides are good and have a unique taste to it. I like mine spicy so they usually add a little bit of spicy miced pork with some sort of vegetable to my rice. So good! Popcorn chicken bento is $6.85 + tax. The restuarant is quite small with only a few tables because this is mostly a take out place. If you want to sit down and eat it fresh, I recommend eating it in the food court beside the restuarant."}
{"text":"$7+ for a bento box. Sides are delicious, the three cup chicken was a little dry with a lot bones. Overall Nice for take out lunch."}
{"text":"BEST POPCORN CHICKEN IN MARKHAM! For 7$ you can get a huge bento box with deliciously seasoned chicken nuggets (name on menu) and three sides. This place can't be beat and what makes them worth returning to is that they're a humble small business. I've been coming here for years and both the quality and taste of the food has not changed. The price has increased over the years but just by a few dimes, which is really honourable in today's inflation. I came here today and what really amazed me is that they are trilingual now with English, Cantonese and Mandarin. I used to come here and have to speak to a specific lady to order in English as my Chinese is horrendous. So I'm very happy for that!   You can order fried chicken, fried chicken nuggets, fried pork chop (like katsu), roast chicken leg alone or a dollar more with rice and sides. I've been told these side dishes are very traditional if you want to experience Taiwanese cuisine. I love the fried green beans and sweet potato & taro cubes. There's an assortment of different tofus, glutens, Bean curds and mushrooms as well. I usually go for what I'm familiar with but I don't think you can go wrong with any of the sides.  The price is unbeatable, the portion is enough for two meals so this joint is definitely worth a try !"}
{"text":"One of my friends introduced me here for Taiwanese food and I really couldn't have imagined a tiny place @ metro plaza ever be noticed..   Huge fan of fried popcorn chicken, made to order and definitely worth every dollar of mine....its crispy, spicy and not slapped on with heavy batter....  Their lunch boxes (bien dong) are well worth the price, with 2-3 sides and rice....only $6.45+tax. The portion will even fill a big guys stomach...  I believe the two most popular items are lu paai gu (porkchops) and popcorn chicken cuz alot of ppl seem to order that..   Yes, its a eat and go place with like 3 tables but thats our culture...thats why there are so many hk restaurants (cha chaan tang ) but back to Taiwanese food... this definitely reminds me of my Taiwan trip...when I go crazy at the night markets there...the quality is similar...yumms!!   oh yea just to be even more authentic.. cha time is closeby...now go grab your roasted milk tea with grass jelly and popcorn chicken from here....   Satisfying your cravings.. this is how you do it!! Lol..."}
{"text":"Best place to get quick food, especially if you work around the area.  Their combo comes with rice and 3 side dishes that you can pick. I like their popcorn chicken combo the most, usually I get a combo without a rice (so you will get additional side dish).  Missing one star since they used to give a chinese soup (and now they increase the price and no more soup *sad*) and average service during rush hour."}
{"text":"Decent food at reasonable price with free soup or drink($6.45/combo). My coworkers drive to buy their lunch box almost every day... I love there veggie dishes. Suggest the pop corn chicken with veggie combo. More than eight veggie dishes for u to choose from, the taste is much better than another Taiwanese takeout restaurant I have been to. They upgraded their decor on July 5th, so it looks cleaner than before."}
{"text":"I spent 13 years Taiwan and this is by far the best location in Toronto that I've found for Taiwanese food so far. How tasty the side dishes vary dependent on what you choose, but the fried chicken / pork as the main are juicy in the inside and crispy on the outside, and not greasy. Efficient service.   Not your ideal place if you're looking for a nice sit down restaurant, but for descent Taiwanese take-out food, this place is your gig. You get high value for the price you pay. Approx $7 for a bien dang ????that includes soup, rice, one main meat, and three side dishes. The meat portions are quit abundant for how much you're paying. The side dishes vary by dish. Food is colourful, flavourful, and nice variety. Taiwan is a food haven for many Asian countries and this restaurant, although the location is not visually appealing, is a must go and the closest resemblance of Taiwanese food I've come across. (Although if I were to grade it in Taiwan it is a 75%), but here in Canada I'll take it!   Bottom line, this is a must go. Get your bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Friday rainy night at around 630 - There was a line up for takeout bento. Maybe 4-5 in front of me but one guy in the front ordered 10 bento boxes to go and he pretty much wiped out all the side dishes, at least the one I wanted. I guess it's night time so they weren't refilling and ur left with whatever's remaining.  Didn't bother me too much since they have a wide selection of side dishes.  We ordered two bento, one popcorn chicken (most people ordered this one), and one chicken cutlet. All Bento are same price $8 after tax.  We took our bento to the nearby metro square food court and ate there.  For the popcorn chicken, I felt that the seasoning and texture was good but it's not hot and crispy enough. Maybe there were many orders so they made a lot in advance. As for the chicken cutlet it was hot and crispy and tasted good. Each bento comes with choice of three side dishes and u can pick the same one as well. They were a bit on the greasy side but not salty which is good to complement the chicken.   Overall reasonable cheap quick eats.   If I'm craving for popcorn chicken tho, I think I'll wanna go zenQ or presotea/chef papa. They make hot and fresh popcorn chicken, every time."}
{"text":"Best Popcorn Chicken in Town!!!  The place is small, very small.  They only have two table of four, and one of their table always have stuff on it, no one can't use it...  However, it's a very good place for take out.   I usually order their popcorn chicken (aka \"Deep Fried Chicken Nuggets\").  They served it in a paper bag.  Just like in Taiwan night market~~  (Remarks: I usually paired with bubble tea from GongCha.  For me, it's the best snack combo in Metro square).   Their bento box is good value too.  And I can have popcorn chicken bento box too (LOL). ~$7 for one main dish, 3 side dishes, and a soup.  They have so many choices for side dishes, love it!!  And their portion is pretty big.  Line up is a bit confusing.  Many people will line up at the cashier to place the order... Actually, we need to line up at the food counter to place our order first.  Then go back to line up at the cashier for payment and picking up our orders.  Hope that they can put some signage in the store.  They accept bulk order for the bento box, however, the minimum order is 50 (if i'm correct)..."}
{"text":"My family has been getting Taiwanese lunch/dinner boxes from here for the past 10 years or so. We don't frequent it often because we have a wonderful cook at home but when she is on her day off, we come here. This is really a take out space. They only have three tables there and it's usually busy around dinner time with a long line in a crammed place so it's not very pleasant to have sit down dinner there anyways.   We always get their fried pork cutlet (pai goo fan). Fried pork cutlet is very tender, flavourful and they cook it made-to-order style. Also tried their three cup chicken which comes out of the freezer and into the microwave,  then into my box. Doesn't taste anywhere close to the real deal.   For the side dishes, you have three choices. They have various stir fried dishes including green beans, eggplant, cabbage, brocoll, some tofu dishes including ma-po dofu, and some chunky pork with fat trimmings. Then they top  your rice with minced pork and jus -  either spicy or non spicy.   Prices are reasonable - usually 6-8 bucks pre tax and includes either turnip soup or can of pop."}
{"text":"Solid place for Taiwanese bento box. Extremely consistent with delicious side options. Good price for what you get too.   Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"This place is my fav. since high school. Popcorn chk bento is what i usually ordered."}
{"text":"I stop by this place whenever I am in the area..the popcorn chicken combo never disappoints! This place also serves many other signature taiwanese dishes such as three cup chicken. It can get quite busy on weekends around lunch time.  For about $7.xx, you get popcorn chicken on rice with a choice of 3 sides and a soup. My favourite side dish is the sweet taro/potato but it isn't always available, the different sides vary so it's really a hit or miss when you get there...other sides are such as vegetables, tofu, bean curd and green beans.  I give this only a four star rating as there are only two tables in there for seating, more of a takeout place..however, you can always takeout and eat in the foodcourt beside!"}
{"text":"delicious and good price. always come here when i'm hungry and not sure what to eat. my favourite is the meatball rice but occasionally they sell out of it. i've tried some other main dishes and they are all pretty good. they also have a huge variety of side dishes and they are all delicious. one of the best taiwanese places!"}
{"text":"Alright - it's been another three years so it's about time i give it another update. Admittedly, I eat here at least once whenever I come back toronto. I've been eating at this place for over 10 years now and their salty crispy/popcorn chicken has never failed me (my parents used to bring them to waterloo for me when they visit). If i'm not eating the chicken, i get their fried pork chop rice. Whenever you get a rice combo, you get to pick three sides and they have a ton of great vegetable and meat dishes to choose from.  The quality of the fried foods has been inconsistent over the years. It's hard to say when i'm going to get great and when i'm going to get meh. Nevertheless, the recipe remains and there really isn't another place in the GTA quite like this place.   It remains a mom and pop shop (the very pretty taiwanese mom used to man the front while the pop is in kitchen) but neither of them are there as often they used to be. The service is also inconsistent. If you are lucky, you get the nice ladies, if you are not, you mainly face indifference."}
{"text":"Very hidden place in Metro Square. I frequently go to Metro Square and have never noticed this place until a friend recommended me to come here for popcorn chicken. The place is quite small inside with only two tables, so it's ideal for take-out.  They have lunch/dinner specials which comes with three sides of your choice and a soup. If you want to change your soup to pop or bottled water it's $0.50 extra. I tried the popcorn chicken and it was pretty good. Didn't \"WOW\" me, but still good. The portion size was quite big as well and the total came to $7.50 after tax, which is cheap as compared to a popcorn chicken rice set at your favourite local bbt place.  The only thing about this place is that the service when they're taking your order and preparing it, I felt like I was being rushed out the store. But what can you really expect. It's not meant for dine in and it's quite busy during lunch hours. Also, CASH ONLY!  I would definitely come back for more take out and try the chicken leg next time as it sounded like a popular item from what I saw/heard others order."}
{"text":"Deep Fried Pig Blood and Fish Cake?  Deep Fried Popcorn Chicken?   For sure you can find Taiwanese's delicacies here at Tai Ping Xiang that reminds you of your trips to Taiwan!   The setting of Tai Ping Xiang is just so primitive... a self serve fast food place with minimum seatings to encourage you have everything to go..and their lunch boxes are designed for this sole purpose, take your food and eat them somewhere!   The server/cashier was just so nice and friendly... I ended up letting her pick my 2 sides that went with my popcorn chicken..   Popcorn chicken is really crispy, really light!! and they were made to order.. not sitting under the heat lamp for anytime at all. Well seasoned with a nice peppery taste.. I have to confess \"I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN!\" and I am proud of that!   Deep Fried Pig Blood and Fish Cakes were both A-OK!! Great snacks and with them served in cute girlie paper bag to go... make it a really Asian night market street food experience!!!   Cash Only!"}
{"text":"3 stars  the food is not bad here especially the popcorn chicken since its made quite fresh...  only couple of peeves... 1. the young girl working.. looks like a teenager.. shes always grumpy/cocky... no matter how polite you are to her shes still pissed off.. 2.  sometimes whats left of the selection is quite old as they only make side dishes in very small batches. 3. the size of the bento... its pretty much like a swanson dinner size.. not the 1lb grand version too..  thats all"}
{"text":"Man I have trouble going into this restaurant.  The smell is just bad, like stinky tofu.  When I went there the last time there were basically no seats so I decided to go somewhere else instead.  I'll try it out again if I ever get the nerve."}
