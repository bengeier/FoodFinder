{"text":"Got the #5 combo cup bap & #15 bibim cup bap and they were amazing. My family who doesn't share my taste for Korean food even thought the food was very good and they would have it again. The price is pretty decent as well. I'd say definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Korean experience here.  I saw spam, roe, and other interesting options on the menu.  Worth a trip.  My bowl felt healthy yet filling.  Tasty but not too rich.  Very good lunch!  Price was a bit high for what I got but not crazy expensive."}
{"text":"Jipbap almost looks like it is part of Ozu Ramen from a distance, until you realize it's a completely different restaurant. I wish their store had a bigger sign with their name, because it kind of blends into its surroundings. 

Jipbap is a fast casual place and prices are pretty cheap for Campustown. Give your order up at the front, they give you a receipt with a number and when they call your number, just go pick up your food from the counter. You can easily get a filling meal for $5-6.

The food is great- I had never had cup bap before but I got the Chicken Bulgogi cup bap (#2) on the menu, and it tasted amazing. I'll definitely be going again. The spicy mayo works well and somehow everything goes together. 

A tip for those watching their carbs: make sure you ask for your cup bap without rice and the noodles they put at the bottom. Its still kind of carby because of the sauces they use, but it tastes amazing. Probably not the best place for someone on Keto to go to.

Vegetarians have a bunch of options here, too. The Tofu Kimchi Cup Bap tastes phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best AND affordable places to go for a quick bite. Bulgogi CupBap and Udon was amazing. The food came out in timely matter and the service was great. I would be back for sure to try all other menus. Very excited that I found this hidden gem in campus."}
{"text":"Continuing with trying out different Korean restaurants in the Champaign area. Walked in with mixed feelings after looking at the menu and after a horrible experience at a certain nearby \"Korean\" place and I was pleasantly surprised by this place!

The food itself is OK. Not really Korean but more like a Korean fusion food that resembles Japanese donburimono. Not the best in town but certainly great for a quick grab to bite. Recommended for lunch if you're in a rush to class.

The ambience is nice. Cosy, chic, a bit cramped but they're definitely doing their best to accomodate as many people. It gives off the vibe of the nearby boba tea place. Oh also, their choice in music is perfect!"}
{"text":"This is my newest favorite restaurant on campus. Located close to the engineering quad, you get quality Korean food at reasonable prices. I probably eat here 3 - 4 times a week, if not more! My favorite is the #2 chicken bulgogi bowl with a fried egg on top. Each bowl has rice on the bottom, followed by noodles, lettuce, your choice of meat, and spicy mayo sauce. Yum! You can also get the spicy mayo sauce on the side, if you'd like."}
{"text":"Into it. Spam bowl was great. I also really liked the noodles in the bowl."}
{"text":"I've ordered #13 (kimchi and masago i think) every single time I've gone, and I've always received my order within 5 minutes. They give a generous amount of food, both rice and noodles packed into the bowl and once mixed, the spicy mayo and other ingredients mix really well together! Will be going back to try other bowls. 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"A solid Korean food option, especially for a quick lunch. The food came out fast, and  although the bowls are convenient... they make it difficult to fully mix the dish. Approximately $8 and good flavor & portion size."}
{"text":"Great small meals for reasonable prices. Everything is in a cup! I had the Eel cup and it was very tasty with good flavors. Their bulgolgi onigiri are also mega delicious. I do wish they had larger portions and faster service since it's sort of a to-go place."}
{"text":"Just ok... sauce tastes weird. But my friend likes it. So it really depends. But it's very fast and convenient."}
{"text":"Been here three times, generally pretty good food. The second time I had bim bap and it was lukewarm and made me feel kinda sick at night. Other two times were great. The eel cup is the best I've had."}
{"text":"The food comes out super fast and the service is great... not Jimmy John's level but right before I got the water the food was ready. The place is clean and nice. The taste of the food is decent but the portion is a bit too small for me. This place is great for a quick bite near campus."}
{"text":"TL;DR (out of 5):
Definitely the best, most effective opening I've experienced in the campus area.  Jipbap serves up quick, delicious, cost-friendly Korean-based rice bowls - with some Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai influences thrown around.  The food is fresh, well proportioned, and just well prepared overall.  There's nothing significant to complain about tbh.

Basics: Cup + Rice + Spring Veg + Japchae Noodles + Meat + Spicy Mayo + Teriyaki Sauce

Food: 4.5
Atmosphere: 4.5
Price: 5
Service: 4.5
Decor: 4

I first saw the beginnings of Jipbap when it started construction many months ago; it had plain, non-formatted posters that read \"Rice in a Cup! Noodles in a Cup! Everything in a Cup!\" So naturally, I assumed it would be a slow-to-start fast Korean food shop with mediocre, gimmicky food.  Well... I was wrong. Oops.

I ordered #13, \"Kimchi and Smelt Roe Cup Bap.\"  Less than 5 minutes after ordering, it cam out smothered in spicy mayo and teriyaki sauce (essentially just like how sushi is in the US), which I originally thought would be excessive; however, with the amount of food packed into the bowl, the sauces perfectly coated everything when mixed!  The smelt roe added just a touch of freshness and brininess to each bite.  Definitely a good go to if you want a little kick to your bowl.  I can't say I have any complaints really.  I noticed a couple customers having issues with their order numbers when I was leaving, but the first 30-40 orders went out without issue.  I guess I found it kind of weird that they have pho, bun thit nuong, and green curry on their menu since those are 2 Vietnamese and a Thai dish, respectively.  But Asian restaurants on campus having two different cuisines on their menu has been a pretty common occurrence, so I can't blame them for trying.

I just feel bad for the cashier (I think the owner?) who, in the ~25-30 minutes I was there, explained what was in a \"cup bap\" at least 15 times since it's a new restaurant and whatnot.  Look at the posters/decorations people!

Kimchi and Smelt Roe Cup Bap: $7.95"}
{"text":"Didn't like the vegetarian option :( i tried the kimchi tofu bowl. The ingredients were fresh, but the texture of grounded tofu tasted like meat :("}
{"text":"VEGETARIANS BEWARE the items listed on their menus that are labeled vegetarian are not because the sauces and kimchi contain fish sauce. Even their tofu is sautéed in fish sauce. There are actually very few, if any, truly vegetarian options. The employee was nice enough to let me know and was patient as I asked through the menu."}
{"text":"Food 4/5: I got the combination cup bap and this thing is huge (and only seven bucks!). Meat was tender and spicy mayo added lots of flavor. There was a lot of meat, but be warned: there was also a nontrivial amount of lettuce and rice in the bottom half of the cup. All in all, delicious and filling at a great price!

Ambiance 4/5: Clean, casual spot. Designed with lots of food pictures and some cute signs.

Service 4/5: Cordial service, pretty fast.

This would definitely be a regular lunch spot for me if I lived in Urbana or Champaign."}
{"text":"Hey this is my first time at Urbana (COLLEGE!!!) and I heard some good stuff bout this place. Place is small and relaxing. 

I asked dude at the cashier what recommendations are dope and he replied \"Go with either #1 or #5 g\" and elaborated what each consisted inside. I went with #1 because not only was it the popular choice according to cashier dude but also because I'm with CODA and we #1. 

I saw my food from afar and the cup looked small. I was like I paid 8 bucks for a small cup? And then as it got closer...BAM! That cup was wide in circumference and area! Food got me full. 

I'd say this place is pretty nice. Fair price, good food; it's Gucci Gang with me."}
{"text":"I'm not too fond of eating out of a cup and DONT DRINK THE CORN TEA ... you'll never forget the moment you did.  Food was ok just didn't look like the pictures"}
{"text":"It's cost efficient and really delicious as far as I know compared to other restaurants nearby. The staffs are friendly and helpful. Also, the dinging environment is quiet and delicate."}
{"text":"The cup baps here are one  of the first and best Korean dishes that I have tasted! Besides the place has a good location and pretty chip dishes. The place had a lot of choices for vegetarians as well and the sea weed rice cakes here and the spicy pork kimchi cup bap is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a good place for lunch (portion wise) and the food comes out tasty and quickly. I've been here several times since they've opened and I know a lot of people have good reviews. 

My only complaint is that I usually get the vegetables swapped with vermicelli but on my last visit, the worker in the back messed up my order by not replacing but instead said \"We don't do that\" when clearly they do swap the items when the owner is around. And for that reason, I bumped one star off."}
{"text":"I was planning to go to The ramen shop next door but they weren't open.  This Korean place was right next door and I'm glad that they were open!  They serve bimbap bowls which are perfect for lunch. I ordered the #1 which was beef bulgogi (they also have chicken bulgogi, kimchi, tuna, spam, sausage, tonkatsu and other different things.  )They asked if I wanted it spicy (mild, medium and hot) and I opted for medium.   The bowl is rice, topped with noodles, lettuce and your choice of meat.  It was really flavorful and just the right amount of meat.    The price was reasonable - $7.95.   I took a star off because I just wish there was more - the bowl that it was seved in was a little more than half full.... I was still hungry afterwards, but it also gave me the perfect excuse to indulge in bubble tea two doors down at Latea.  The owner was super friendly and didn't scoff at me when I asked, \"what do you recommend?\"    The place was bustling with Asian students so a definite sign of value, taste and authenticity.  But As I was walking up to the restaurant, I did notice a bunch of them standing around the ramen shop windering if it was open or not....but that's just my guess....but this is a very good meal!  Way to go!  Hope they stick around!"}
{"text":"After going to two restaurants and finding them closed, my friends and I went to Jipbap. And after eating here, we all came to the conclusion that we want to come here again. 

The lady at the cash register was very nice and recommended a couple of the common dishes, such as bulgogi (which one of my other friends got). After ordering, it wasn't long before I got my #13 Kimchi and smelt roe cup bap. I loved how refreshing the lettuce and kimchi was with each bite, and how savory the rice was. And smelt roe is always a plus for me. My only complaint was that one of my friends and I thought there was a bit too much spicy mayo, however we will fix just ask for it on the side next time, since it was still very good. I always love spicy mayo, but not too much. 

The atmosphere is enjoyable and I can't wait to come again and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! You get a lot of food for your money, it always tastes good and you'll get it quickly. This is definitely my favourite lunch place on campus, I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Decent food. One of my friends ordered veggie dumplings, but got beef dumplings... beside that hiccup, food was alright."}
{"text":"Great go-to to-go joint! Lots of different proteins to choose from, but they all end up tasting about the same. Pretty filling for a 7-10 dollar price. Great as left over and easy to reheat. Yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go on campus. Affordable and delicious Korean food prepared to go. I have gotten several different items of the menu and am satisfied with all of them! The food is prepared fairly quickly and the portions are quite large (which I love) and are served in buckets so you are definitely getting your money's worth! I'm a vegetarian and they have plenty of options available for me with the menu indicating which options are gluten free or vegetarian. I take my friends here all the time who are interested in trying Korean food in a less intimidating setting!"}
{"text":"Yelp guided us to this little place Sunday. We were very pleasantly surprised. My husband's eel cup was loaded with big pieces of eel and nicely seasoned with ginger. I really enjoyed my extra hot
Spicy pork and kimchee cup. Those cups hold a lot of food, so each order is a bargain. The decor is nice and the staff are very sweet. We don't get to Champaign often, but would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch unsure of what to expect since it's relatively new. I ordered the spicy tuna and it tasted great. Plenty of food for a reasonable price! I wish they took AmEx. I also wish they would be a bit more liberal with the gochujang (bibimbap sauce) because I found myself needing to request more to enhance the flavor. Otherwise, nicely sized portion of delicious ingredients. Excited to come back!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Korean cuisine. The food was excellent, and I'll definitely be back. Price was very cheap and the food was out in no time at all."}
{"text":"I visited Jipbap with my relatives earlier this month, and we were not impressed.   Most dishes are served in a cardboard bucket, with the selected combo all included.  Our portions were reasonable, but the taste was not special.  The other patrons appeared to be younger (late teens - 20s) than my group, so probably our older group was not this restaurant's target audience!"}
{"text":"I took my littles to this place to try the hype and now they're hooked. Treating them to a convenient, to-go restaurant was just what we needed with good Asian style choices. Thats probably the best thing about this place. Was worried about the taste being too salty but I think it depends on what you get. Overall, the hype was satisfactory. 

The inside is very comforting and a good place to grab a quick lunch or dinner with some friends. The cashier needs a bit more practice because he took a while to count my change. 

I knock off a star based on the recommendation the cashier gave me. He said the eel was popular and I tried it but it was a bit tiring after a while. Not their fault, just my taste preference. There wasn't much but lettuce to counteract the sliminess and the sauce was more pickled ginger than anything. Worth another try but definitely not up to Chicago fresh food standards. Anything else worth trying?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something quick and affordable, then Jipbap it is.  It's a type of Korean food that is fairly popular in Korea, I heard, and the idea of the food is easy.  Rice on the bottom and your choice of meat, vegetable, and sauce over the rice.  In my opinion, the sauce is too much so I always ask the kitchen to put less sauce.  The portion is fairly okay but if you got a big appetite, then you'll probably need to order two.  The staffs are very friendly and nice and will help you explain what's in your food in case you're unsure what the menu is all about :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the  bowl (#17, I think). All in all, the mix of rice, , and lots and lots of lettuce didn't work.

I did taste a friend's spicy pork bowl, and that seemed okay, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The location is a little small but the food is great. I had the spicy spam and it was so good! It's worth a visit and the service is great."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for some quick but really filling food! Their cupbap on average takes about 5 minutes to prepare since it's all created with the basic ingredients (japchae, rice, lettuce) and then the specific sauces and proteins are added on top depending on the order. My favorite is the spicy pork (and the kimchi spicy pork too). It's extremely flavorful due to all the sauces they put in it, but you can ask for the sauces to be put on the side if you're afraid there might be too much. They also come in very large portions that are served in cup containers that are easy to take on the go (they have lids) if you don't finish it all. Overall, fantastic place for fast and filling food!"}
{"text":"#1 on the menu! Beef Bulgogi Cup Bap consisting of Korean BBQ beef served with rice, lettuce, noodles. Sauced up with teriyaki and Siracha mayo. --- I absolutely loved this! It was enough for leftovers and so I got two meals for the price of $6.95. After I ordered, it took about 2 minutes for my food to be served; hot and delicious. 10/10 would recommend! After this positive experience, I am extremely excited to try out other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Jipbap is pretty great in that it provides quick food that is simple but delicious. Their food is a minimalistic variation of bibimbap and usually comes as a cup of rice, sweet noodles, lettuce, and a protein. I've had the chicken, beef, combo, and eel and loved them all. Great comfort food. I only wish they could customize and modify orders to your liking, which they really cannot do. I do get a little bored with the lack of variety in the cups."}
{"text":"Generous portions, tasty meats, perfectly cooked rice and noodles, crunchy lettuce, and delicious sauces.  We ordered #1 beef, #5 combo (beef, chicken, pork), and #14 eel.  All very good.  We went with mild sauces, might go up to medium next time.  

Please open a franchise in Chicago - this kind of place would do great there!"}
{"text":"Fresh, yummy, authentic, healthy. Unique menu and decent prices. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I've had a couple of things here on different occasions, and they were both so good. Spicy pork & spam was not that spicy, but just so comforting and flavorful. Eel was good too, and comes with generous pieces of unagi. I love that the bowls come with rice, salad and japchae."}
{"text":"I'm writing to warn customers of this restaurant. It's not genuine Korean food. Worst thing I've ever had. I ordered kimchi tofu. It smells bad and taste like trash."}
{"text":"I can't say I was very impressed. I order a traditional cup bap with spicy pork and a fried egg.  It came out very quick and was nothing out of the ordinary.  For 8.67$ I would say what I ordered is a bit expensive considering Cafe Benne makes better spicy pork cup bap for about 6$.  I am going to try this place again and order something on the less traditional side, i feel like their other crazier dishes would be better and worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and reasonably priced. My go to is the Spicy Pork, and always make sure to get the egg on top, it's worth the extra buck!"}
{"text":"Korean casual take-out style food next to Ozu Ramen. I tried the beef bulgogi cup bap and I thought it was too heavy on the BBQ sauce. However it was not too expensive and the restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere. If you're in a rush and want your food on the go, then this place is suited for that. Just give your order to the cashier and wait about five minutes or so for the food to come."}
{"text":"Another pretty tasty Korean new food style place in campus town. I know we have a lot of these but they are all pretty diverse with differing food options. This place specializes in cupbap, and they have many varieties to try at reasonable prices. Try it yourself."}
{"text":"Wish I had a couple mates to cheer me up when I'm down, Oh nevermind that there is Beef Bulgogi at Jipbap to drown out my wails."}
{"text":"Yum! My husband and I came for dinner to try something new. The guy at the register was super patient while we tried to make a decision.  We are just starting to eat Korean cuisine.
 I went with the chicken japchae. It really hit the spot - a good blend of delicious comfort food like noodles and veggies so I felt healthy. The portions were big too so I have lunch tomorrow! I'll definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Yum!!! I loved my tofu Bowl with medium spice- The sauce was delicious- and I'm all about the sauce.  Great lunch spot- clean, modern decor.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Korean cup bap ! I tried their Pork and spam cup, as well as the tonkatsu cup. Both were pretty good, but I personally liked the pork and spam better. I also tried their , which is assortments of fried Korean dumplings and stuff and it was pretty good :) My friend and I each got a cup and ordered one  to share and couldnt finish everything.

With that being said, their serving size is pretty generous! But then again, it is $8 for a Korean street food so I expected it to be that filling. 

All in all, great place to grab a quick bite :) Beef and pork marinate both tasted pretty authentic."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a simple and delicious lunch. Salad is very fresh and sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Overall the concept of this place is vary simple. Traditionally cup bap is a Korean dish that generally includes rice and veggie side dishes. The interior of the place has a very modern and clean design with wooden tabletops and Ikea looking chairs.

The food overall tasted pretty good. I asked the cashier what is the most popular recommendation were (#1 and #15) and I picked the Spicy Pork Kimchi Cup Bap. I picked the medium spice level which gave bop a very pleasant flavor. It had a sunny side egg on top in addition to the spicy pork, Jap chae noodles and the veggies. The combination mixed together well. I'd gladly come back and try another flavor as well. The portions are also very large as well. I Highly recommend this place for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tofu and Kimchi Cup Bap and it was the best vegetarian Korean dish I have ever eaten. It was enough for two meals, which is just another reason why I would go back. Can't wait to try something else on there menu!"}
{"text":"Less than 10 bucks for lunch/dinner. If you want to have quick lunch, I would say Jipbap is one of the good options in Champaign. Their tonkatsu menu is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is the portion size. Entrees are served in a bucket with generous amounts of meat and (for an extra $1) an egg on top.
This is a casual place, but the food quality was very high.
I will be back."}
{"text":"Ugh... drawback to traveling is seeing well-rated restaurants and not knowing what types of areas they are in.  This is in a college area of town... for anyone not aware.  Had we known this we would have been well aware that this would be mediocre at best and not very child friendly.
We walked in, walked back out... walked into a few other places who had no child accommodations and ended up back here for an overpriced, flavorless meal that half my family wouldn't eat.  It was bad.  We should have driven elsewhere.
The girl at the counter was very nice."}
{"text":"Seems like a cute idea but the food isn't the best. I think it's a good presentation and packaging, though. I just wish the food was a little tastier than just rice, mayo, and lettuce. Rice balls were good though and packaging was great!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after just enjoying my awesome food. After a long time I had a flavorful pho and yum fried dumplings. The staff is fun and the decor of the restaurant is cool.
I ordered pho with my tofu and veggie dumpling salad. Food came fast. Pho was wonderful, it had lovely flavors of cilantro, jalapeño, onion and lime. There was perfect quantity of noodles as I hate when there are more noodles than broth.
Dumplings were so good and the sauce went great with them. I wish there was more than just lettuce in salad mix but still fine. I am definitely visiting it again."}
{"text":"My go-to for a cheap, quick, tasty and filling lunch.

In town for a conference and tried this new-to-me place. Having a packed conference schedule I needed something quick and good. This place seriously delivers! 

They have a quick access menu with real pictures if you're visual like me. If you're not sure, grab a longer menu from the counter to find out the ingredients. I have had #13 (masago and kimchi) and #4 (spicy pork and kimchi), both at the spicy level. 

The #13 is PACKED with masago; don't think you'll be getting a small-sushi-like portion. My chopstick skills were not good enough to penetrate this packed bowl. #4 is similarly packed with a nice gooey egg on top.

Also the staff have been super friendly each time I've come. Come and chill or take it with you.

Next time: I'll be trying the combo. Looks too good!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I always wondered what bap is and now I realize that it is cooked rice. This is a quick fix for lunch on a budget. I was happy to get the beef bulgogi cup bap which somes with teriyaki and siracha mayo along with beef and rice. You can't go wrong with this rice bowl for lunch on campus. Food is served hot and fast. Although your options are limited really to soup noodles and Bap cups, I see this as a fast food version for Korean food. I will be back!

Pros: good prices, quick service

Cons: limited menu, difficult to find street parking during school year

Hidden deals:
none

Health code rating: A. Brand new place, clean. No link on CUPHD yet"}
{"text":"A pretty unique idea, love the combination of the japchae, rice and lettuce, although I do feel it could have used a bit more rice. There was a bit of gristle in the bulgogi beef that we got which I don't mind but I know some people don't exactly like. Overall it was decent value, the service was nice and this will definitely fill you up. 

Keen to try it again!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, food is cheap, comes out fast, and tastes great. I've been maybe 4 times in the past week, and every time have had a great experience. The ordering process is easy and fast, the employees are friendly, the space is clean and looks nice. I usually get the Tuna Mayo or the Chicken Bulgogi. Both (and I'd assume the same for the other cups) come with a bed of rice as the bottom layer, a layer of glass noodles in the middle, and the meat and other toppings on the top. The food is filling and very comforting. They also have samgak kimbap/onigiri (rice triangles) with various fillings for sale, which are little heavy on the rice, but still taste great. 

All in all this is a great addition to campus that serves something unique in a very effective way, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday, it was so good! And I was very happy with the price. Will be going back often!!"}
{"text":"Think Chipotle, but Asian. Imagine rice or noodles in a cup that fits your entire palm. Now add a ton of toppings (corn, lettuce, and so on) and finish it off with a heavy layer of dressing. That essentially describes the majority of item on Jipbap's menu. 

It's enough carbs to make you feel full, which is more than I can say for other restaurants on campus. They're not stingy with their portions. The sauce on top adds strong flavor to the entourage, given you like mixing your food like I do. The sushi rolls (handmade) and fried dumplings (frozen) were typical."}
