{"text":"Love the $3 pints and $6 appetizers during happy hour.  Friendly staff and a great bar to sit at.  Try the $6  happy hour nachos."}
{"text":"We just hosted my Dad's surprise 70th Birthday party at Sprecher's and I have to say, from the get go, everyone we worked with was over the top accommodating and such a pleasure. Planning this event from the West Coast could have been very challenging, however, I felt such at ease walking into the place on that afternoon. Angie, our waitress, was on point with every request and such a pleasure to work with. The appetizers were great, and due to a restricted medical diet, they had a great selection of vegetarian options! 
I highly recommend this place for casual drinks, get togethers with family, or to listen to the live music! 

We cannot thank you all enough for such a wonderful day that my Dad will remember forever!"}
{"text":"Food service is awful - wait staff is good. Meals came out in waves like they do in China.  Food was blah. Schnitzel was dry as were the chicken tacos. Reuben bites were filled with corn beef hash which isn't as advertised. Great atmosphere but would not come back."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. My husband and I stopped in to Sprecher's for a sort of post-Memorial Day/back to work after a long weekend treat. The wait staff is friendly but I think we were very rushed. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start - Chef \"Mic\" (as in Microwave) did not get all of them as hot as they should have been. I wondered in what freezer lane of Costco they were found. Also, our server forgot to bring the little plates - not a huge glitch but I wondered what else would go not-so-right.

Well, that was dinner. Decided on the spur of the moment to get comfort food - meatloaf, mashed potatoes and \"creamed corn.\" The corn actually was whole kernel with some semblence of cream sauce, which was ok-tasting but not hoopla. I am not sure what flavor was in the potatoes, that were under the two thinnish slices of meatloaf. I could tell by the \"stiffness\" on top of the slices that the meatloaf - perhaps the entire plate - had been sitting a long time and zapped for heat. yarny breaded onion whatever-they-were didn't do anything to cover that up.

We sat on the patio, which we normally like there, but were seated just under a speaker at the edge of the gazebo that covers the bar. I'm not \"old\" but can only take so much Z104 during dinner. 

Once we were done, took forever to get our bill and a take-home box for the leftovers. Would have been an OK instead of really not-great experience if it hadn't been so expensive. Not such a treat. Has been better other times we've been there."}
{"text":"I chose Sprechers for dinner - after hearing that the presidential debate was being watched there on Wednesday. We called ahead to confirm this was actually happening, but when we got there we were told it was a private party, but maybe a TV in the bar could be switched to it. 
Then we received the menus, and I got a (gluten free) beer that they do - which was the only good point of the evening (other than the waiter, who was very friendly and did his best...) 
Sprechers had been on a list (which I will try to remedy) of 'Gluten Free Friendly' restaurants, which it very much should not be. Not only was there no accommodation in the menu, the response from the chef conveyed through the waiter was 'tell us what you want, and we'll see what we can do'. At a restaurant the size of this place, they have not ONE stock dinner, salad, or even a list of safe sides? There were zero appetizers after discussing how the chips were made - that I could eat, and most of the sides were unsafe too. 

I don't expect a ton with 'non hippy' restaurants, but even Wendys has their crap together more than this place. It's not such a rare thing any more to request this, and the irony was their menu had signs for people with peanut allergies all around. 

I won't be going back - and I would suggest anyone else who needs more than off the shelf no thought food does as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we heard they had good food. Enjoyed our pretzel appetizer with three different dipping sauces but our burgers were greatly lacking. Mine was greasy and had no flavor. Wouldn't come back for dinner but may try appetizers again."}
{"text":"I would say that my experience was more like 3 1/2 stars. On an impromptu trip to Wisconsin with my husband we made it a point to eat at the restaurant since I have heard of the root beer before so we were equally intrigues by the prospect of an eatery as well.

Going here worked out perfectly since it was less than a mile from where we were staying in Middleton. Parking was ample and the place seemed to be hopping when we were there on a Saturday evening. Not overly crowded, but sounded busy.

Wisconsinites sure love their cheese and beer (not to say that I have a problem with that). You can clearly see this incorporated into their menu. We had to have the fried cheese curds app (when in Rome) and we opted to get a beer cheese soup. Our server was even nice enough to suggest split bowls. We loved the apps. Our food on the other hand was just ok, it didn't sit so well with us the next day. I guess we don't have the iron constitutions of Wisconsinites mixing beer and cheese into all their food. I had a chicken marsala with portabella ravioli and my husband had the schnitzel. The marsala didn't really taste like one in the traditional sense, but it was drowning in a cheese sauce. I can't complain too much because I loved the portabella ravioli. My husband had the schnitzel and he liked the gravy it came with and the twist by putting an egg on top. He only wished it was a a little more runny. 

On the whole we had a good experience. My hubby loved the mix and match deal for the beer and the soda. He thought it was worth it so we got both. Our waiter was really nice and friendly and we got seated quickly. I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Easter brunch here this year. There was a little confusion about the table I had requested when I made the reservation. I had specifically requested a table that did NOT require a step up since I was familiar with this restaurant and had been here before. I knew my 70 year old mom was not going to be able to get up and down to enjoy the buffet otherwise. Price was ok for what was offered compared to others I had researched, especially for a holiday buffet. I would've liked to have seen a hash brown casserole added verses just mashed potatoes and gravy. We LOVED the system for custom omelettes!! They give you paper squares that function as order forms for you to leave on your table, or hand to your 
server, but I recommend the latter so it doesn't get lost since they are very small. Then your omelette is brought to you when it's ready!! No waiting in line for the omelette, or clogging up the buffet line, very efficient. I was a little disappointed with the first one I ordered, it came out very oily, like the chef had dumped it on the plate with all the oil from the pan rather than using a slotted spatula to transfer it. The second one I ordered was perfect, like the first one my husband had gotten at the same time my first oily one came out. That particular chef needs a lesson or heads up to correct that problem. The OJ was awful, I returned it, and I hope they get better OJ!! I was glad it had not been an extra cost; it was included in the buffet. Coffee was EXCELLENT and they kept us well supplied with creamer too, but I could've used more frequent refills. It was VERY nice that they had a free egg hunt, two of them nonetheless, and that they split the hunt according to ages putting little kids inside the fenced patio. Very smart!! They are safer there, away from the road, and can get eggs without threat of faster older kids intruding. We have an older child and she appreciated the front lawn with bushes and landscaping to actually \"find\" eggs verses just picking them up. The prizes and candy inside were really nice too! She got mini bags of candy rather than one piece plus some had coupons for a free root beer float!! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Service was okay. Food was okay. Husband had the fish fry and he said it was good. My burger was not freshly made like the menu says. My bun was very stale"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday afternoon for the first time.  All of the tap beers were $1 off and all of the appetizers were $6, so that was a plus.  They had a great selection of stuff on tap from Belgian triples to a fruity porter, so if you like beer, there will be something you'll enjoy.

Waitstaff/bartenders were really friendly and the food arrived in a timely manner.  The cheese plate had very generous portions and came with capers, kalamata olives, and blueberry jam.  The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing (well, there weren't too many people there on a Sunday afternoon).  If you like the Dane but want to try something different, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Do not order the salads! I ordered the BBQ Chicken salad and was disappointed to find it made of mostly iceberg lettuce (with huge chunks of iceberg cores), cold bland chicken (was expecting warm grilled chicken) like that from a fast food restaurant, mealy tomatoes, and they forgot to top both mine and my mother's with the much anticipated onion strings.  It came with cold stale bread and an overly-sweet bbq drizzle.  I had previously been impressed with their appetizers and had hoped for a much better experience."}
{"text":"We ate here on 11/3/12 and were very pleasantly surprised.   Service was excellent, friendly and attentive.  The prime rib was very good and the braised short ribs -- out of this world good.  Sides were ok...not remarkable, but pretty tasty.   The only real complaint would be the $6 for a \"snifter\" of the Double Bock beer, which was really good but not worth the price it was offered at.    If you get a chance to go, the braised short ribs are TERRIFIC!  (Don't bother asking for the recipe, they say no!)"}
{"text":"Sprecher's is a delicious pub/bar. It's casual, it's tasty, you get the idea. During my most recent visit, I went with two of my friends (and some family). As expected, the high point was the flavorful and bubbly soda. You come for the soda, not the food (The food is okay but nothing to write home about). What was not expected was the music. Our party was outdoors, and there was dancing music on. After dinner, me and one of my friends got up, pushed some chairs aside (one thing I love about this place is the casual atmosphere), and started dancing! This pub is one of my favorite things about going to Madison, and it definitely does not deserve its 3 star rating."}
{"text":"I've been to Sprecher's a number of times; sometimes I'm impressed, sometimes underwhelmed. Service tends to be slow and unfriendly, though not bad.

Ambiance is pub-like, as is the food selection. It's fairly dark and can be loud, much like other pubs I've been to.

The food, however, varies greatly in quality. My first visit, I got some delicious fish tacos and thought I'd found a new favorite spot. Subsequent visits have been increasingly worse. Most recently, I got Beer-battered fish and chips that were more batter than fish. Also,the menu did not specify what kind of fish it was, and the fries were limp and tasteless. My companion got the Reuben bites, which, though tasty, resembled deep fried pink  goo. For the price of the food, I would expect higher quality."}
{"text":"The food is ok, on par or slightly better than other restaurants of this style.  The waitstaff on a Friday night was competent and friendly, but the front of the house is a mess.  There were at least four different people behind the hostess stand at various times, and none of them seemed to communicate with the others.  When we put our name in, they asked for our phone number so they could call when a table is ready.  This seems unnecessarily complicated, and we watched two other couples who arrived after us get seated before us.  The waiting area is small and completely in view of the hostess stand...just call my name or come get me when you're ready to seat me!  Or if that simple system, which has worked for ages, is too complicated to grasp, then invest in the pagers that other similar restaurants use.

They do get points for having all of their beers on tap, but they only offer three of their sodas on tap.  The others are in bottles.  If it's a company store meant to highlight their products, why not have all of the sodas on tap too?

For what it's worth, pick up a variety pack of their excellent sodas and pretty good beers elsewhere, and skip the brewpub to get better food and service elsewhere too."}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow, I heard the manager say some nasty things to his employees, and the food was very mediocre. Can't believe we paid so much to have this experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre. The soda is great, but everything else misses the mark.

I was disappointed the last couple of times here, but decided to give it one more shot. Beer cheese soup was more like a watery, premade broth. I could have sworn I found small still powdered cheese lumps in mine (i.e. this wasn't \"homemade\" but probably from a premix bag or something). Hamburger was just OK. Chicken wrap was tasteless. The servers, while earnest, seem to always be new on the job and miss the mark on offering solid, balanced, unobtrusive service (either too much or too little attention given to table).

My soapbox thoughts of why a restaurant gets into this state? It's either the manager or restaurant owner or both. If you have a supportive owner who wants to make quality food using quality ingredients and a manager who really knows the restaurant business and can keep the staff on their toes, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and not prepared correctly.  I ordered the meatloaf which was good except it was barely warm, with cold mashed potatoes, and ice cold mushy canned vegetables.  My girlfriend had the Curd Burger which she said was good but it came with cold soggy fries.  My daughter ordered steak with mushrooms and fries.  The mushrooms didn't come with the order yet somehow arrived late, cold, and slimy. Her fries were also soggy.  My other daughter ordered a salad that had kiwi slices that were dried out and not skinned properly,  all the fruit and vegetables on her salad were bad except the strawberries.  I feel bad for the wait staff if this is the way food is sent out of the kitchen.  

We go out to dinner on Thursday's and this is the first time at any restaurant that everyone said they would never want to return.  There are too many options in the area for a little more or less money that are astronomically better."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times for group outings. Each time, I hoped the food would taste better - or at least be worth the price. The only thing going for it - IMHO - is the private room for groups."}
{"text":"This was a very lively social place with some great atmosphere on the patio.  The night life was so lively, that I actually never made it inside the restaurant and spent several hours outside.  There was live music, a wonderful fireplace, and a large bar with big screen TVs showing the game.

The food was good and there was a wide selection.  The only problem that I had was that the didn't have any schnitzel on the night that I was there.  I guess to me, that is like going to McDonalds and them telling you they don't have any Big Macs today.  As such, I have to give them only 3 stars.  If they had schnitzel and it was poor tasting, I would still have given them only a 4."}
{"text":"Customer check # 159745 July 3rd. CELIACS BEWARE! 
Love Sprecher's food, but obviously the wait staff is not properly trained or do not understand that GLUTEN FREE isn't just a life style choice! For my family it is a medical necessity! My wife and Daughter are CELIAC. Gluten is neither welcome nor medically healthy for the women in my house. My daughter order RATH PASTA Gluten Free. My Wife ordered 10\" BBQ  Chicken on GLUTEN FREE FLAT BREAD. Both orders came from the GLUTEN FREE MENU...I HEARD MY WIFE SPECIFY GLUTEN FREE FLATBREAD...We chose Sprecher's for the food and good gluten free menu. We love the one in the dells. After we left Sprecher's we went to West Town Mall, my wife had terrible stomach pains, my daughter looked like a ghost, both had headaches. My wife deposited her dinner in the ladies room. At West Town Mall. That is when we checked the Receipt listed above, NO GLUTEN FREE on the pizza thing. It tasted good, my wife had my daughter try it. I tasted it. Best gluten free pizza I have had. Unfortunately it wasn't............... Thanks goes out to Sprecher's for ruining a wonder day!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Every time my wife and I try to go there, the seating host always greets other people before us even when we arrive first.

I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"They have an awesome outdoor patio, but the food is so-so, and eac time we go there, they mess up the order somehow. But, location, location location and on a nice day, its nice to sit outside for lunch."}
{"text":"We visited Sprecher's last night and left feeling dissatisfied.  We each had a burger and the clam chowder and split a side of onion rings.  The onion rings were very good.  However the rest was not.  The soup arrived somewhere between lukewarm and hot.  Not cold enough to complain, but not really soup temp.  We were not offered water or given a napkin.  We had to ask for that when our burgers arrived.  We also had to ask for condiments.  When they brought the ketchup (for two burgers and onion rings it was only a small container with a couple tablespoons in it.  When I asked for more, the server acted like that was unreasonable.  The burgers were also less than hot and served on a huge thick bun which made them very hard to eat.  We ordered a second beer and that must have been served in a glass with cleaning residue as there was an off taste to it.  

The restaurant was cold and everytime a smoker stepped out to the patio we were hit with a blast of 5 degree air.  

Overall - we will not go back there."}
{"text":"The Flatbread pizza had less flavor than frozen pizza I can get at the grocery store. The other food we ordered was just passable. The service was sub par. We had to ask for napkins and silverware after the food was served. It took almost 10 minutes to get water we asked for. I would never come back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here. I like the service, the beer, and the atmosphere; especially the patio on warm days. However, I have been disappointed with the consistency of the food, lately. I go every few months and it seems even if I order the same thing they prepare it or present it differently each time I go... the changes aren't always for the best. 

The beer cheese soup was very watered down the last time I went. I remember having it in the past and wondering why I even ordered a main dish because the soup was filling. A few weeks ago the soup was watery and disappointing. I won't order that again. 

I'll definitely return, but if the food continues to go downhill, I will stop going and update my review."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 30 min to be seated after parties your size or larger have been seated before you even though you're first in line and then wait at least an hour for simple food (burgers and brats), then this is your place. Only redeeming factor was the band, Retro Specs."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable lunch prices, an awesome ambience and friendly service.  I've been here twice, once for a private party and again for a business lunch.  Well done on both counts"}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor seating, I would come here just for that alone. There was live music as well which was great. The food is decent, the new thia summer options are really good and I would recommend those."}
{"text":"We just had a great dinner at Sprecher's, it opened Monday (1/25/10) so we figured we'd give it a try before it got too busy.  

It is a local restaurant so the menu has a Wisconsin twist with a gourmet presentation.  They carry the full selection of Sprecher beers & root beer so you'll definitely be able to find one you like, plus you can get a growler of beer or root beer to go if you don't get enough while you are there.  We both started off ordering a tap of Sprecher root beer, both came in a frosty mug and were absolutely delicious!  

We ordered the Wisconsin cheese curds as an appetizer and they were wonderful, the presentation was great and you could actually taste the beer in the batter.  My husband had a burger and it was cooked to perfection on a wood fired grill.  I had a turkey & guac sandwich and the turkey was actually thick cut, not thin cut cold cut style and again, the presentation was top notch.  

After dinner we did order the Creme Brulee on the previous poster's suggestion and it was delicious.  Plus, it was a good size portion for 3 bucks!  

Sprecher's will definitely be our \"go to\" restaurant for when we've relatives or friends in town and need a mid-price range restaurant for all ages."}
{"text":"From the moment we called to reserve some tables for our group of 30-35 people, the manager was great to work with. He was inviting and made sure we felt welcome to come in 30 minutes. We showed up and he had a back room so the entire team and their families would all be together. Brooke and Dawn were amazing in working with our group. The service, drinks and food were all great. I highly recommend this restaurant for any size group looking for great service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Awesome root beer. The best Reuben sandwich I have ever had in Madison.

Good service on a quiet Tuesday night.  All the other dishes on the table looked good, too.   We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the Reuben with the beer cheese fries plus a starter of the pretzels. 

I know I'm not from the Midwest but I was entertained and intrigued by the brown gravy with the pretzels. It was an interesting experiment but the cheese dip was much better. The mustard received high reviews, as well. I make a lot of pretzels and used to do it professionally so let me tell you, I've eaten a lot of soft pretzels. These were some of the best I've ever had. Plus the cheese and the pretzels reheated really well! 

The Reuben made me moan out loud. No joke. Pulled fresh corned beef with a ton of sauerkraut and the bread was excellent, as well. The cheese amount was also generous on the sandwich. My favorite sandwich is a Reuben so I get it most everywhere and this is among the best I've ever had. 

The only disappointment was the beer cheese mashed potatoes. I was warned they were dense, which they were. But there wasn't a lot of cheese and the potatoes were really dry tasting. They could've used more cheese or cream. I'd stick with the fries or pub chips instead."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, the atmosphere is nice, but the food left a bad taste in my mouth. My husband and I ordered the fish fry, which tasted good at first but after a few bites it tasted very bland. We ordered \"cachapas\" which are piles of \"pork\" and lettuce on top of a soggy corn patty. They smelled spoiled and one bite was more than enough to make me feel sick to my stomach. We left without getting the root beer floats we were both looking forward to."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer last week with some friends on our way back from dinner, and to my surprise the bartender was beyond excellent, being my first time here I was interested in all the beers. She knew all the little tings and tangs about the various beers, she even game me a mini tasting to I could try, I had a citrusbomb, it was out of this world. Citrus hops, clean crisp finish, made me say wow out loud. 

Can't wait to return for a full flight!"}
{"text":"The food and service is awful. We had a party of 8, four of whom ordered the special of the night, prime rib. Every order was medium to medium well. One was sent back and still came back underdone. Every order they served was raw. The ribeye which was ordered medium rare arrived well done, no pink. The quesadilla and pasta were fine. After complaining the first manager comped the drinks. Only three people had drinks. 
After more complaining and refusing to pay for one dinner that even after being sent back was still too raw the second manager appeared. She did the right thing and took the raw dinner off the bill, and took 50% off the badly cooked dinners that folks tried to eat. 
Not clear if the server got the orders wrong, of the kitchen made the mistake. The server forgot to take the order to the kitchen of one of our party. 
The meal was s disaster and I will never return."}
{"text":"Not a good experience.   My meal was terrible and my dinner companion's had to be sent back due to the overly fishy smell.  It smelt like the fish had gone bad."}
{"text":"Disappointment. This place is way over priced and the food is meh. The chicken taco salad I ordered had a few pieces of dried out chicken and not much else, no beans even! I would not go back there again, there are to many other good places in the area."}
{"text":"I\"ve eaten at the Sprecher's in Madison about a half dozen times and at the Sprecher's in Wisconsin Dells once. 

I have found the food to be solidly good but not great. I usually order the Schnitzel. I was in for dinner last night, and I ordered the sauerbraten over spaetzle. My associate ordered the Friday fish fry. We arrived about 7 and they were VERY busy and we waited about 30 minutes before we found a place at the bar.

And dinner was solidly good but not great. 

They have an excellent selection of Sprecher beers on tap. Sprecher special amber is one of my particular favorite beers. I had an amber and also a seasonal Winter Brew, which was also good.

So I recommend Sprechers as being solidly good but not great, with a good menu selection and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"I went here with some coworkers while we were in Madison. It was very convenient, as we were staying across at the Comfort Suites. Their menu has a very wide selection; while it's nice to try to have something for everyone, it was a little all over the place. I'm pretty sure that this restaurant was going for a German theme, yet you can order all sorts of pasta dishes and sandwiches. 

In any event, the cheese curds and fettuccine alfredo with shrimp was enjoyable. If I got placed at the same hotel again, I would be likely to return, if only for the convenience."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw Nashville Hot chicken on the menu, but kept my optimism to realistic standards.

If you envisioned a mirage of Hattie B's Chicken, well I can tell you that this is not.

While there was nothing wrong with the food, anyone that's been in Tennessee or anywhere down south knows what a proper Nashville Hot Chicken should look like, dry-brined, fried chicken that's been covered in spiced breading, drenched in hot sauce as red as the color of your cheeks turn after eating one. 

These were more like Tyson chicken tenders with panko breadcrumbs. There was nothing hot about them, not even if it's a first impression.

Though not spicy, or doused in sauce, it left a mysterious trail of red chili oil on the parchment paper and two halves of white toast.

Fries were equally as weak, limp and not even crispy enough to withstand being dipped in ketchup.

The tenders were cooked fine, like I said there was nothing wrong with it, it just doesn't live up to it's name."}
{"text":"Fish was below average. Cachapas were terrible, had one bite and felt sick. Beer cheese soup was good. Probably stick to stick to their sodas and beer."}
{"text":"I ordered the am old fashioned, a Caesar salad, and the mac and cheese. My drink was not properly made. Not bad, but certainly not good. The salad was bland at best and the croutons were flavorless. These could have been forgiven if it weren't for the entree. It was one of the saltiest things that I have ever attempted to eat. A few bites in and I had to stop (despite the fact that I was starving). I had to complain to the manager and my drink and meal was comped (I sure as hell wasn't going to pay for a meal that I didn't eat). Even though I could have gotten another, I was completely uninterested.

From my booth with a window to the kitchen I could see more flies than I could count. I'm really surprised that they haven't been slapped with a penalty. That really should have been my sign to leave.

Service was slow, even for a Friday. It took forever for our drinks to come out and to have our order taken. 

I think this goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway. I will NEVER go back to Sprecher's, since this is the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sprecher's for the first time tonight.  We had put off going for a while (to some extent because of poor reviews on Yelp) but went finally.  It was \"burger and beer night\" so my husband got a burger and rather large beer for $8--amazing deal.  He was very happy with the burger.  I had a big salad with chicken which was also good.  All the ingredients were fresh and the dressing was good.  Service was attentive.  The food took a little bit longer than expected but within normal range."}
{"text":"I've been to Sprecher's quite a few times now since they've opened and I've never really been disappointed.  As a big fan of the brewery I was excited to hear a restaurant serving their beers was opening in my area, if only for the opportunity to get Black Bavarian on tap.  In fact I'd probably just keep coming back for that alone but fortunately there are few other things they offer on top of one of my favorite beers ever.  

The first few times I was meeting my father for lunch on Fridays, usually a bit later in the afternoon as I tend to get off work around 1.  My father especially likes the lunch salad and soup AYCE special and frankly all you'd ever need to do to get his undying devotion is offer him anchovies on the side of his Caesar salad.  Sprecher's does this, hence our repeated returns.  I like their combo specials and usually get the chicken wrap with their house salad.  My only complaint is the wraps are always open-ended and sometimes these can devolve into a hell of a mess.  The place always seems to be packed for lunch but since we usually arrive a bit later we tend to catch the tail end of the rush.  That sometimes means the service is a bit slow as we might catch a shift change or something, but overall I've never had any issues worth getting worked up over.  The lunch prices were probably a dollar or two higher than I'd pay normally but nothing egregious.  I could see it being loud if we were at the tables in the middle of the room but we've always been seated in the booths along the walls.

After getting used to the lunch atmosphere it was a bit different to come here later at night for dinner.  The bar area gets livelier but the dining area can be a bit empty depending on the night.  I definitely like coming here when I can enjoy a Black Bavarian or two - it's one of my favorite beers ever and finding it on tap somewhere is always a treat.  Once I did experience a soapy glass but the bartender was quick in getting me a replacement.  One of these days I might just try one of the other Sprecher beers but as of now my thirst for Black Bavarian has not been slaked.  The burgers are quite good - I last had half of my sister's BBQ burger which completely invalidated my \"healthy\" wrap choice.  I also recommend the chicken sandwich, which pairs bacon and gouda with a tasty mustard, and also the turkey, bacon and guac sandwich.  I've never tried the Friday fish fry but a friend of mine seemed to like it when he ordered it.  I have had the brewpub tacos, deep fried tilapia with an interesting spicy slaw.  They're not too bad at all despite the fact I'm not usually a fan of the fried variant.  The sides are usually good.  My default choice is always the sweet potato fries which are crinkle-cut and dusted with a bit of sugar.  The beer cheese potatoes aren't bad either but depending on the entree can be a bit too much.  One of these days I'll try the sauerbraten or the schnitzel but it hasn't happened yet.  Dinner prices are more in line with expectations and the prices for the beer ($5 for a stein, $4 during happy hour) are a steal.  The quality of service has always been great for dinner and I can't recall a time that was less than satisfactory, so it's become one of my favored dinner destinations in the area."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio is awesome. Atmosphere is nice. Food and management? Awful. We've been to Sprecher's several times, each time hoping that our food choice would be better. We've been disappointed each time. Last night my fiance ordered a 5oz sirloin, medium. It came out more than well done, charred even. Not wanting to cause a stink he ate a couple bites but decided it was beyond edible. We told our server who said she would bring the manager right over. The manager came (and blamed the over-cooked meat on how busy they were) and offered a free drink or dessert. I was a little shocked that she didn't offer to make another sirloin or take it off the bill. Since it was my birthday and I would receive a free dessert anyway, she offered a free martini (I wasn't even drinking a martini). When she walked away, my fiance tried to finish the sirloin but just couldn't. The more I thought about it, the more annoyed I was. I called our server over and asked that she bring the manager back. The manager returned and I explained that, while I appreciated the gesture with the martini, I think they should either make him another steak or refund the money. She said they could not do that because he had eaten half the sirloin...it was only 5oz to begin with! 3 bites in and that was too many. I understand that policy, but I feel like any GOOD manager would have looked at the situation and offered to make a new sirloin the first time. He just wanted what he ordered. We left there hungry and annoyed. Great way to end a birthday at Sprecher's!"}
{"text":"Black bean burger was dry and barely flirted with the idea of having a flavor.  911 burger was served rare (almost mooing) at the request of 'a little pink' and the pretzel bun had dried to a crisp under a warming lamp.  The service was leaning towards mediocre.  The appetizer came after the meal and the drink order materialized seconds before we were ready to leave.  The best part was the beer, however I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I visited Sprechers on an unassuming Wednesday night and was quite impressed. My group reserved a table online first (unnecessary? Perhaps.) But there's always something to be said about being able to be seated the moment you walk in the door. The service throughout the night was fantastic- I don't have one complaint (and this is coming from a former server with a very critical eye). 

Sprecher's brews their own beer (and root beer). Not sure if it's done at the actual restaurant? Either way, my wheat brew was fantastic. It went perfectly with the giant plate of nachos that we chose for our appetizer. Without exaggerating this was THE biggest plate of nachos I've come across thus far- loaded with all kinds of goodies ! Yum! 

I ordered the grilled meatloaf as my entree...and although nothing beats mom's homemade loaf, I really, REALLY enjoyed my meal. The portion was more than enough and even though I'm not normally one to eat leftovers, I couldn't wait to give this another go around the next day. 

Finally, I just couldn't resist trying an orange cream float for desert. My overly full stomach said no, but by tastebuds screamed yes! It was the perfect ratio of ice cream to soda. An excellent cap to my unassuming Wednesday night at Sprecher's."}
{"text":"Third time here in 4 years. Don't plan to come back. Worst brew pub in area.  Asian noodle bowl tasted like water, no flavor at all. Medium rare (some pink) curd burger was served well done despite having the med/rare skewer in it. Burger didn't have much taste either and was pretty pricey for what you got.  Fries were pretty boring. Quesadillas went uneaten, meh. Cheese curds were at best average. The soft pretzels were awesome and the beers are really good! Love the atmosphere! Service was fair at best, mother in law said her dish was awful and they barely said sorry and no discount or replacement.  Mediocre food, overpricing and bad service means this place is just a bar to me now."}
{"text":"I went last night with my mom and fiancee to celebrate mine and my fiancee's birthdays.  We got there right around 6, so there was a 30 minute wait.  However, the bar outside was open and we were served beers fairly quickly.  Plus- the beers were $3 on tap for happy hour!  I was a big fan of the Amber beer.  When we were seated, our waiter was quick, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  My mom and I were torn between dishes and he was able to tell us about them and recommend his favorites.  I thought the food came out fairly quick.  I got the schnitzel (hey, don't get many chances to try that in Madison!) and was pretty pleased.  The beer cheese potatoes were to die for, but there were a lot and they filled me up pretty quick.  The schnitzel itself was good, but I felt the pork chops were flat and not very meaty.  However, the lemon caper sauce that came with was very flavorful.  My mom got the curry shrimp and loved her dish.  I tried her asparagus and thought it was really crisp and fresh.  My fiancee got the meatloaf, and while it was not the best he has ever had (that was in Detroit!), he still enjoyed it.  We never felt we had to wait for our waiter long or try to flag him down for anything and overall I really enjoyed my experience.  I definitely recommend sitting outside!"}
{"text":"Quiet place for a Wednesday night. This location is in business area with office buildings and hotels nearby. So not surprised it was a little quiet. Very nice place, very clean. I sat at the bar. Had a flight of beers since they had quite a few to choose from. Ordered the steak with veggies and had beer batter cheese soup (not sure I got the name right), anyhow the soup was really good. The beers were really good. The steak was cooked well and tasted great. Staff was very nice and attentive. I would come here regularly, if I lived here. Especially to taste all the beer choices that they offer."}
{"text":"After several trips to Madison for business, I finally decided to give Sprecher's a try. I'm happy I did. I ordered the Cream Soda, along with the BBQ Burger with Beer Cheese Potatoes. It was all terrific! The Cream Soda was to die for, and the burger and potatoes were great too. The potatoes especially were different from anything I could get back home and very flavorful. The service was friendly and very quick. The next time you're in town, give it a try."}
{"text":"After being greeted promptly by the hostess and having another positive interaction with another server on our way to the table, we had excellent service from Kai!  He was knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt.  He let us know exactly what to expect from the coupon we were using (what would and would not be included); so, there were no surprises at the end.  The food was good.  Although, a bit pricey, in my opinion.  

As far as beer goes, I asked Kai to surprise me for my flight (I'm very indecisive and it was my first time here) and after asking me what I usually drink, he hit a home run.  The beer was delicious!  

They have a free Pub Club that offers neat discounts, too.  So that's a plus.

If you stop in, I suggest sitting with Kai.  You will not be disappointed in your experience!"}
{"text":"Not great but not bad either.  I like the smell of the wood fire and our service was decent.  We'll be back but it won't be a priority."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find because it's hidden in an office park next to a corn field. Great bar/restaurant  with an out side patio that has bar and restaurant  seating . No cover live band on the sat I went but no seating because it was packed. $ 3 drink specials between 9pm and 11pm with a band and the beer was good. Great tap options with the good beer no miller or bud stuff. I can see why this is a cool local spot. The food looked and smelled great but we just came from dinner for drinks. Tables with fire pits to eat at or the bigger communal fire pit  with deck chairs  to relax around is where we ended up because the Bar was packed. This place was cool so check it out."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the past and had a great time. But this time my experience was so-so. 

We came to enjoy the happy hour specials, but I didn't know you could only get those sitting in the bar area. We were seated at a table, but I unfortunately asked to move as we came here for those specials. I felt bad, but our waiter was very nice and understanding. If only he was our waiter at the bar, too. 

The guy manning the bar must have been trying to leave, because he didn't acknowledge us for at least five minutes. He kept counting his drawer and didn't bother to look up or tell us it would been just a second until he could help us. After he finished counting the drawer, he disappeared for another couple minutes and we were still without a drink. Finally after about ten minutes, we got a beer and  ordered some nachos. 

Great deal on the nachos! Huge serving with all fresh ingredients. I wish it would have been served with salsa, but we didn't expect such a huge portion for only six bucks so I can't complain too much. The draft beers all seemed a little watery. Not bad, but lacking a little flavor. I ordered a mixed drink after that, which was as expected. 

After our initial encounter with the ninja bartender, we had good service. The two guys who came to take over for the night were very friendly and seemed to have a few regulars, so they must be doing something right.. And they were attentive. 

Overall, a decent experience. Food was good, and I like the happy hour specials.  I also work in the service industry. So I know what it's like to want to get out of there when your shift is up, but sometimes you just need to grin and bear it and take on another customer or two. Or at least acknowledge people sitting at the bar or in your area ... They do, after all, pay your bills .."}
{"text":"Horrible everything was cold I ordered a steak rare and was burned and over well done after getting it redone veggies still cold... Only things that were hot out of 15 entrees and apps were pretzels which were super greasy in beginning... I work as a server so I never write negative reviews but this was horrible and service way below par"}
{"text":"These clowns are lucky to be in business at all.  Basic stuff like, oh, seating people presents a challenge.  Approached host stand, stated number in party and was told \"we are just clearing off a table, it will be just a minute\".  They didn't offer the red blinky thing so I stood there waiting for....just a minute.  As new would-be diners approached, I politely stepped back, maybe 6 feet away.  For 25 minutes.  
Food was nothing to rant or rave about, wouldn't go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"I would've given it 5 stars, but when I first walked in and sat on their really nice patio, for about 10 minutes the wait staff completely ignored me. I ended up sitting at the bar, and the bartender took my order right away.
The food (5 stars): I ordered grilled chicken with quinoa and it was delicious!
Overall, definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"Not great. I've been to the location in The Dells and had a wonderful experience, so I am pretty bummed. 
I ordered a wrap with very dry and tasteless chicken. The rootbeer was delicious as always. I will not be hitting up this location again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner after my boyfriend's graduation this past weekend. We stopped at 8 PM and it was still packed, which was kind of to be expected due to the amount of people in Madison for the weekend. However we were seated within 15 minutes of getting there so the wait wasn't too bad!

Keeping my rating the same. However our service was much worse this time around. We barely saw our waitress and had a very difficult time tracking her down to order more drinks. We experienced better service from the guy who brought our food out, which he would've received our tip rather than our waitress.

This time around I decided to try their fish fry and it was very good. The breading may have been a little too thick for my taste, but it wasn't very greasy and the actual batter had some yummy herbs in it to compliment the fish. You also get a fairly large serving (3 big-ish pieces of fish with fries and coleslaw). The fries were yummy, not a fan of the coleslaw but I generally don't like creamy coleslaws so whatever.

Everyone else really liked their food too. This is always a solid place to stop and grab a bite to eat, just wish our service would've been better!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer.  Outdoor bartenders were sort of inattentive and just not very good at tending bar in general.  Beer is just o.k.  It was nice weather though, and nice to be outside."}
{"text":"Where to eat on Monday night? Sprecher's! 

We had been there several times in the past, the food always just was ok. They have an extensive menu, but it seemed that they didn't do anything really well.... until we tried their wings. 

We split my only go to on the menu - Thai lettuce wraps. Which were tasty as always. Then we each got the wing special. 

2 pounds of wings AND beer for $12. What a deal! 

The wings were fresh, lightly battered, and coated with delicious sauces. I had the Asian and Barbeque, my fiancé had the buffalo, and all were delicious! He did not care for the blue cheese dressing, but that ranch was average."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went here for dinner tonight. It was their first time, my second. The weather was great and we got to sit at a fire pit table on the patio. Our waitress was great and very attentive. Couldn't have asked for a better environment for dinner tonight. The food is pretty good too. (I had the ribs, a friend had the \"Sconnie Burger.\") My only complaint is in the quality of taste didn't match the price. 

Make sure to get a bottle of root beer when you're here!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I realize I should have waited to try Sprechers during warmer weather when the patio is open. Instead I was there in winter, in a booth near the door and nearly froze from cold drafts (air, not beer) everytime someone entered or exited the building.

The cheese curds and root beer were excellent. I had the Pub Salad with Buffalo chicken as my main entree. It was very good, though I wished it had more greens. My date had the Saturday special:  Prime Rib with veggies (zucchini, yellow squash and carrots) and mash potatoes. He said it was good. I thought it was the thinnest slice of Prime Rib I've ever seen and overpriced at $22.00.

I would like to go back and try some of the more interesting offerings. I'm not a beer drinker so it's the variety of food options that will draw me back. I will make sure to go again when I can visit the patio everyone else raves about.

... Oh, and the heat must have been broken in the women's bathroom that night, too, as it was damn chilly in there."}
{"text":"I went to this place for a b'day dinner. We had apple and walnut salad and a quinoa chickpea roll. It was okay. Not great, not bad !  My friends said that they liked the beer which is locally brewed. I don't drink :P I would say if you like drinking, give this place a shot :)"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, had a burger with a fried egg on it and their own brewed beer. It was pretty good. Bartender lived in my home town at one point... more than 1900 miles away. Decor is so so, but the food and beer was excellent. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food but the best part is the outdoor patio!  The summertime is the best time to visit Sprecher's in Madison.  But for those colder nights they do have fire pits!"}
{"text":"Food was about par with any chain american resturaunt, but the beer and staff were excellent. Skip the dining room and just have an appetizer and a drink at the bar!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here tonight. Perfect night for alfresco dining. Ordered drinks at the bar as we waited for our table. For appetizers we had the wings and cheese curds of course. Very good. 3 dipping sauces. For entrees I had the corkscrew pasta with chicken and spinach in an Alfredo sauce. Delicious! My husband had the jambalaya which was just spicy enough. My daughter had the buffalo chicken flatbread which was good. If it's nice try to eat outside. Service was very good!"}
{"text":"We go to Sprechers nearly every week for trivia nights which are wicked fun even when we pack our whole team of 6 into one booth... 

The restaurant is always packed but with so many places to sit, the wait is usually minimal. My only complaint is STOCK UP YOUR BEER. When ordering, the waitress must've told us 5 times that she was out of each beer we tried to order. Finally on our 6th try, we settled on one of our last choices. Yo Sprechers.. We want BEER!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sauerbraten with red cabbage and spaetzle and was very disappointed. It's the first time I've eaten sauerbraten in cubes and spaetzle that looked like hash browns. The best thing about the meal was the Bavarian lager that was recommended to pair with it. I would have to use the word \"meh\"as an adjective to describe this meal."}
{"text":"The worst beer cheese soup I've ever had. Had 1 spoon full. Was gross. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Burger was cold charged a $1 for soda refills, service was horrible and non existent. Worst of all they doubled charged my amex tried calling them to get it fixed none seemed to care so I disputed it with amex instead. I wouldn't go back here. It's a shame I do live their beer/root beer

Update: amex informed me that the location was unresponsive to their request and refunded me the double charge."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Sunday, partially because of the $7 appetizer offer, only to be told when the check came that this only applies if you sit in the (empty) bar.  Best part of the wings was the housemade buffalo sauce - the wings themselves were covered in flaccid soggy skin, not crisp at all.  Spinach artichoke dip was watery and not seasoned, a little better after I added salt and pepper.  Got 3 stars because of the friendliness of the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Drink the Cream Soda - don't eat the food.  Seriously.  

I want to like this place - Sprecher Cream Soda is my favorite \"craft\" soda of all TIME.  I lived in IL for 10 years and would seek it out in every grocery store I could.  I was super excited when we moved back to the Madison area and lived near the Sprecher. **Disclaimer - I don't eat meat!** The first time we ate there was in the restaurant, where I ordered their version of Mac and Cheese. I have eaten a lot of Mac and Cheese in my day - this was nothing to write home about. In fact, it was pretty sad, considering Sprecher is a WI company and should specialize in WI things like CHEESE.  The second time we had carryout, and I got a Margherita Flatbread. I kind of feel like it's hard to screw up pizza - but even this was lackluster. It was soggy and the ingredients were definitely not fresh. I wouldn't say it tasted bad, but it definitely didn't taste good.  I can't speak for our guests, because they aren't going to admit that they didn't enjoy the meal we just fed them, but I know both of my husband's meals were \"just okay\" - with the exception of his Fish Dinner, which he did love. In MY opinion, the menu here has SO much promise - I just wish it was executed better."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very knowledgeable with the menu and what she personally liked. All of us enjoyed our meal and appetizers. We really recommend the homemade pretzels and dips."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, and service. Food quality has a lot to be desired. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've had several visits here, and have had great food and not so great food.  Had fish fry at lunch and it's been wonderful, then on a Friday night, not very good.  Clearly the food is best when they aren't busy.  Love their patio, love the atmosphere, but the food varies."}
{"text":"Have been to the west side location several times. Great wait staff and food. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Everyone in our party ordered something different and everyone was pleased with their dish. We will definitely return to try more yummy food."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. The restaurant was half empty when we arrived yet our waitress managed to mix up our drinks and mess up 2 of the orders in our party of four. We notified the waitress and she said she would \"check right on it\" yet she took an order for a table of six and checked on another table before telling the manager our meal was wrong. Those in our party that had our correct meals were half done before the manager came over to say the flat breads we order would be out soon. He saw we were upset and gave a round of beers to those who were still waiting to eat. After the meal the waitress came over and curtly said, \"Sorry, I'm busy.\" and then walked away. I waitressed for ten years, and if she can't handle the slow Sunday night she needs to switch careers. The food overall was ok. Not great, not terrible."}
{"text":"Checked out the new Sprecher's Restaurant the other week for dinner with family. We were pleasantly surprised. Upon pulling up there were a ton of cars - we thought there would be a wait, but once inside it didn't seem that crowded and we were seated right away. We suspected the outside patio contained most of the people to go with all the cars we saw. The had a decent assortment of Sprecher beers and an equally as good selection of sodas. I got the root beer which was a bit small but very good. Our waitress was really nice and friendly and the menu had a good selection. The prices were fair - not real cheap or expensive. I had the Cajun Pasta. It was a very good portion and had good number of shrimp and andouille pieces. (I hate it when it says shrimp and you get like two). The only complaint was that it wasn't very spicy - but then I like it pretty hot. Wifey had the Steak and Wedge and mom had the steak sandwich. Both were very happy with the food with the exception of the \"Sprecher beer cheese potatoes' - these were pretty flat and tasteless. Over all we enjoyed the dinner and plan on coming back again soon."}
{"text":"NO VAPE, EVEN OUTSIDE !

I am no \"power vaper\", I just enjoy a little nicotine with my after work beverage.  Pretty good Belgian tripel, really bad policy decision.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and good drinks. The bar was very clean, so we're the redtrooms. Waitstaff very knowledgeable and friendly.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends a few weeks ago. We all enjoyed what we ordered - I got the margherita flatbread (delicious!!), another person got a seafood salad, and another got the chicken special. I also ordered a side of fries, which I liked - I think they might be beer-battered, I forgot to ask. They have some of their non-alcoholic beverages on tap, but even the cherry cola I ordered came with a nice big frosted mug. Next time, I want to try the root beer on tap, it must be awesome! It had a nice atmosphere, not too loud (or too quiet) to have a real conversation. Friendly, helpful waitress. I live about a half hour away, but I'll be planning another visit here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Sprecher's, helloooo? Wake up!  We used to love this place because the burgers were large, done excellently and had great atmosphere.  Now the burgers are smaller, marginal, the fries are wimpy and the Arnie-Palmer was poor.  Serious reduction from 5 stars down to 3 based on previous years.  We are long term customers and have no reason to go here anymore.  Sorry...good service isn't enough."}
{"text":"I have been to Sprechers many times and have never been disappointed. The managers check in and make sure everything is perfect. One time one of the managers caught that they had brought us the wrong mustard just by glancing at it from across the room. Everyone's always having fun, and I've seen them accommodate large groups (20+) on the fly."}
{"text":"The kitschy German decor not withstanding, the food and beer are both very Wisconsin. From the various flavor cheese curds, to all the locally sourced foods, to the Milwaukee brewed craft beers on draft, this restaurant is a slice of local color. Every night there are different happy hour specials, live entertainment on the weekends, and trivia Monday's and Wednesday's. The servers were helpful, friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"Great food, great patio area and good beer selection. Awesome happy hour on drinks and appetizers on Sundays. Big fan of this place especially during the warm months"}
{"text":"Used to really like this place. But today my family and I went in for lunch to use a $10 off purchase of $25 or more coupon. I mentioned the coupon to the waitress at the beginning while ordering our food. When the waitress came out with the bill she said my manager said the coupon doesn't apply because a daily special was ordered. 1st mistake: waitress should have told us one of the things we ordered didn't count for the coupon when I expressed our desire to use the coupon while ordering (we obviously would have adjusted our order with proper info communicated by server). 2nd mistake: server should have owned up to her mistake to her manager and got the coupon applied to our bill given the server's failure to communicate. I reluctantly paid the unadjusted bill and even gave a 20% tip. Then I spoke with a manager about the situation and the manager offered to take $10 off our bill. I said I already paid the bill and had lost patience to wait longer for $10 that should have been properly taken off the bill in the first place. Mistake #3: rather than offering the $10 discount that should have given in the first place, manager should have given us a $20-25 gift card for failing to give the discount, additional inconvenience, and in order to increase the chances of retaining a recurring customer. I will never go back unless they right the situation with a gift card of some sort."}
{"text":"I've lived in Middleton close to 2.5 years now and can't believe I haven't ate here yet. My wife and I decided to go out for lunch with some family to Sprecher's Restaurant and Pub. We walked in and I was impressed with the ambience. It's very comfortable, low lighting, nice size booths. 

We started out with an appetizer. We ordered the nacho's. The nacho's are offered in two options, choice of chipotle chicken or black bean and beef chili, corn tortilla chips, cheese sauce, shredded lettuce, jalapeños, pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream. We had the black bean and beef chili option. It was very good, the serving was huge considering we had three people! 

My wife ordered the Mushroom and Swiss burger, topped with Swiss cheese, sautéed mushrooms and red wine gravy with lettuce, tomato and onion. She liked it, she also had a side of the French Onion soup instead of fries. The soup had way to much salt in it for our tastes.

My father in law had the Breakfast burger, which comes with a Fried egg on top with bacon and cheddar, he chose hash browns as his side per recommendation on menu. He loved that burger and said the hash browns were a good touch. 

Now for the real food! If you've read my reviews you know I LOVE pulled pork sandwiches. My wife pointed out to me the pulled pork on the menu. I was instantly inclined to order this bad boy. The sandwich contained slow-roasted pulled pork, Sprecher's BBQ sauce, Gouda cheese, jalapeño slaw and crisp onion straws on a toasted onion bun. The bbq sauce was weak in my opinion. The rest of the sandwich was great. The Gouda cheese really finishes it off. I ordered a side of pub style fries that were seasoned. They were very good. 

The service here was really spot on, the refills kept coming and the waitress was very friendly and informative. 

Overall I'm happy to have finally tried Sprecher's. My wife and I will probably walk here in the summer versus the chains at Greenway Station. I recommend this place for any business lunches, nice dinners with family, or just catching up with friends. 



We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the half Ruben, sweet potato fries and French onion soup. It was all very good. The menu surprised me. I was looking forward to a big selection of German food, but it was very limited. They should reconsider their name. The menu was varied and the decor was beautiful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite/lunch. I tried the cheese curds and pretzels. At first I thought the cheese curds were okay, then I had cheese curds at Madison's. Sprecher's definitely need some help. Tasted just like a frozen appetizer. I had never had cheese curds before, so I thought it was just cheese curds in general. Pretzel sticks were pretty standard for pretzel sticks anywhere. Highlight of my meal was my beer! I had the Heffe Weiss, and it was seriously awesome. Loved it. I sat outside on the patio, on a beautiful day. That part was nice!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the outdoor patio was nice but the food and the service left a lot to be desired. We had to ask for water 3 times. My husband ordered the prime rib special - medium. It came out with a heat lamp induced crust on the top and was well done.  No pink at all. He never received the soup that came with the meal even with a reminder. Service was very slow. 4 of the 5 meals at the table required catsup (burgers, fries, etc). It was not provided. Had to ask twice for it. Finally arrived 10 minutes after the food. Fries that came out limp to begin with were just nasty by that point. BBQ chicken flat bread was very unimpressive. Kids Mac and Cheese was from a box and had that lumpy and sticky look that it gets when you re-heat it.  It's really too bad - such a great outdoor area but service and 5 bad meals in one sitting will keep us away."}
{"text":"I wanted mac n cheese while visiting Wisconsin... the tailgater mac n cheese with bacon, brats, onion rings and sriracha hit the spot, and will live on in my dreams for a good while!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio tonight and it was great. Happy hr until 7, cheap drinks and and large portions. very friendly wait staff. All together a perfect night. Hoping to go back before I leave town later this week"}
{"text":"good food, good service, had a nice time with son, daughter-in-law and spouse on 10/12. Easy place to hold a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"I read a lot of the reviews before going there and was a bit nervous.  After going, I'm not sure if I just went on a good day/time or what.  Service was really good, the pretzels were amazing and the quesadilla was really good too.  Being a fan of micro-brew beer i found the beer to be pretty good too.  Overall it was a good experience and I will be back!  One extra bonus is that on Sunday's it's happy hour all day, $3 beers and $6 apps!!!"}
{"text":"I would say the beer is decent, service good..... Food terrible. There is nothing \"fresh\" tasting about anything I have tried, and I have given them many a chance.

The beer garden is really nice, but again the food straight off the Cisco truck and into the fryer. Too bad."}
{"text":"Prices are good. My flatbread was pretty good however my boyfriends burger was overcooked. The waitress was a little inattentive and didn't ask how our food was until I was done eating. Also tried to charge an extra $1 for having a strawberry margarita vs regular which seemed odd considering they didn't use fresh strawberries. They did revise the bill and take it off though. Overall okay place. Might go back but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, good soda, hot waitresses. I'd go again.

Good beer, good soda, hot waitresses, good food. I'd eat there again.

Desserts were good too."}
{"text":"The ambiance was excellent and the ouside seating had a lot to offer. Unfortunately, the service was poor. It took nearly 40min for our server to take our order. In fact, another waiter had to step in and take our order. Once the food came it was cold and flavorless and the bacon was leathery. 

Bottom line, drinks on the patio are a great idea, skip the food."}
{"text":"Sprecher's is great for a large group; very accommodating wait staff, handled the big table well, and everyone found something on the menu that they liked. 
Food is pretty standard pub fare and was good, not impressive. I was not expecting to be blown away, and it did not disappoint.
Their beers were hit or miss - I had the Scotch Ale and hated it, and someone else got the Hefe Weiss and raved about it. The root beer is delicious, and I plan to stick to that in the future."}
{"text":"Normally I'd give this place 5-stars for juicy burgers and an amazing selection. The other night was my first \"meh\" experience, but it was a Wednesday at 4:30pm, so I'll let it slide.

This place really shines in the summer. The patio offers live music and fire pits and an open tiki-style bar that's top-notch.

For food, I love the food truck tacos (get them with shrimp - the veggie option seems like an afterthought and the flavors don't really go together as well).

ALL of the pub food is amazing. This is the place to come for mac n' cheese dogs, brats, etc.

Bathrooms are incredibly clean and somehow feel very private, even though there are many stalls.

Private parking lot is often crowded - but that's just a sign that people like it, right?  ;)"}
{"text":"If you like pub food, this is your place.  The service is slow because the place is packed.  The food is pub food and not the best i've had.  I did try  the low cal homemade root beer, but even that was not the best.  All in all, I will pass next time, but pub food is not my thing."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place,

I come into Wisconsin for work every once and a while and this place is directly across the street from our hotel.  They have a fantastic IPA and a few other decent beers.  The fried cheese curds are delicious and ive heard the other food is ok also.

The staff here is super friendly and always on top of their game.

This is a regular stop for myself as well as others in my company who travel to madison for work."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a good experience here, but places like this don't glean consistency either which explains the wide range of reviews here.

We pulled in and, hubby, who prides himself on being able to score awesome parking spots while everyone around him fails was confused by this parking lot.  The entrance faces the street and all the parking was directly in the back of the building.  Not a big deal, just nothing close to the entrance.  I didn't pay attention so I'm not sure how handicapped parking worked here.  I was also pleased to see ample bike racks though Sprecher's doesn't seem to be in the most bike friendly area of Middleton/Madison.  They have wifi but we were unable to connect to it with the password provided.

We had lunch here on a quiet Saturday afternoon.  Once again our 2016-17 Bucky Book brought us here as we are on a mission to get the most value out of it.  Hubby was going to get the rueben but when he asked if the meat was lean he was advised it generally was not.  That was fine and he appreciated the honesty.  He got the breakfast burger instead.  He gets a similar sandwich at Red Robin and noted that here it came with the top of the bun on the sandwich which kept the meat hotter vs Red Robin serving it with the top bun off to the side.  Still, he liked Red Robin's version better.  I got the chicken enchiladas which I happily dug into.  They came with real avocado and a rice mix which wasn't Spanish rice which I tend not to care  for.  Instead of beans it was a bean, corn and lettuce type side salad which was refreshing.

The coupon required us to each get a beverage.  We generally both get water since we don't drink soda.  Fortunately they had iced tea on the menu.  We were curious as to how the 2-for-1 coupon was going to work, namely would one of the drinks get credited along with the meal.  I'm pleased to report they not only took off the lower priced meal but also one of the beverages.

Finally, others have reported that Sprecher's doesn't offer free refills.  We both had our iced teas topped off at one point without even asking.  When the bill arrived we were only charged for one drink each, with one taken off with the coupon of course.

Without the coupon Sprecher's is a bit more pricey than what we'd choose in a restaurant.  We can get a similar meal elsewhere and save a few bucks.  Still, it was a good experience, our waiter was great and the restaurant on the whole was nice."}
{"text":"We came here since we loved the specher soda and beer. The atmosphere and decor was really cool, it seemed like it would be a great place for big groups. The service was pretty good, but we were also one of the only tables there since it was 4:30 on a Sunday. The food was mediocre at best, if you're looking for a burger or pub food there are definitely better places in Madison."}
{"text":"Food was great. I've always enjoyed their wing appetizer. The burger was tasty as well. Best things though was their nachos, AMAZING!!! Service was not good and would often disappear for a while with the checks. But great outdoor bad and seating area. Definitely coming back to hangout on the patio and eat some nachos"}
{"text":"I'm ok on this place. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. The root beer, of course, is delicious. The look of the restaurant is great. I'd rather buy the root beer from the store and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time last night. Loved my grapefruit kiss drink. We ordered 3 appetizers. Brats fries, veggie quesadilla and spinach artichoke dip. Not crazy about dip but was all pretty good. Waiter, Trevor,  made sure we got happy hour prices even though timing was close :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Sprecher's Nachos; if you are a fan of cheese sauce, crispy chips, jalapenos, and shredded chicken with lots of shredded cheese then these are the nachos for you! AND on Sundays they're only $6! For me, I like cozy booths and quiet restaurants. Babe and I go specifically to Sprecher's because on Saturdays or Sundays for lunch it's always low key. I love their Orange Dream Soda and all of their food is solid. I've had burgers, BBQ pork, salads and all have been great!"}
{"text":"I disagree with the people who say the food is terrible, but it's not fantastic either. The prices are also definitely not three-dollar-sign high. I got a half-size Sprecher's Wrap with a Caesar salad and sweet potato fries for around $10, and it was pretty good.

The melted cheese (mozzarella, I think?) in the wrap was a bit rubbery, and the greens could've been fresher. It also didn't have any Ranch dressing, which I thought I saw on the menu, but I didn't ask about it so I might've read it wrong. The fries were good--I've always been a fan of the sweet-and-salty combination of sweet potato fries--but they didn't taste fresh, mostly in texture. The salad was actually the high point of my meal; the lettuce was fresh, the croutons were nice and crunchy, and the amount of dressing was perfect.

Sprecher's isn't terrible, by any means, but it's not absolutely outstanding either. The atmosphere and service were lovely, and the price was great."}
{"text":"Meh. 
This place is right up my alley and I really want to like it, but the food is subpar..it just is. I have gone to Sprechers 3 times, each time hoping to have a better experience (because I feel like it should be awesome..) but I am always disappointed.

Their beer that I've tried is okay, nothing to write home about. I generally love Ambers and their Amber is decent. The wine is laughably overpriced.. Just don't. The 7 cheese curds that came as an appetizer were good, but this is Wisconsin.. We want more than 7 cheese curds. 

On my last visit, I got the fish and chips. The fish was unbelievably over seasoned, I could barely taste the fish! It seemed like they coated the fish itself in seasoning before they coated it in the batter that was also over seasoned... Bad!!!! Also, the breading was so sad, it fell off the fish every time I cut a piece of fish off. I had to work pretty hard to get a bite with both fish AND breading. I have made delicious fried fish at home, I know it's not that hard.. But apparently it is for Sprechers. I think I'm done giving this place chances. Too bad."}
{"text":"Third time eating here. It's conveniently located near the hotels. The food is just ok. Service is great. The people are wonderful. But the food just doesn't stack up. This past time I had the Reuben pot pie and it was not good. The beef was overcooked. You know the turkey from Christmas Vacation? Well much of the meat was that tough."}
{"text":"\"Ok....\" That was my first impression. Beer and soda are the core. The brat fries were not as expected, way over the top in coating and deep frying, brats not the best flavor, mustards saved it. Large serving for 4 to 6. Skip and order other items. Had a lot of beef the week I was visiting so went with the Chicken Mediterranean on flat bread. First order came cold, with cold fries. Order was replaced and I ordered rice with a really good rice and fruit mix. Flat bread still cold, warm chicken, cold bread on cold plate. This is way to easy for a cook, warm up flat bread, have warm plates for hot food, cold for salads. If is wasn't for V the excellent and personable server it would have been a complete bust. My Guest had a frozen preformed burger that was OK.....If the manager had not given me the chicken for free to offset the trouble I would never go back. I will try again because of the service......but I have low expectations on the food."}
{"text":"We went there to check out a band that we like to see. We like to follow Mad City Funk sometimes because we really like the music. We were blown away by Sprecher's fabulous food and amazing drinks and the decor was phenomenal. Their  outside patio is so nice that my fiance and I were talking about possibly checking out if we could use it for our wedding reception or something. All the lit fires around you excellent music the Great service and the food... I cannot say enough about how good that food is. We were just blown away at the meals we ordered everybody that was at our table thoroughly enjoyed the amazing food on the menu. I would have stayed until it closed if it had been my choice but I didn't drive."}
{"text":"The food was adequate and the people who greeted us at the door were friendly, so two stars. Overall, though, the evening was less than stellar. 

FOOD
I ordered the turkey club with sweet potato fries. \"Thin sliced turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, and tomato served on a multigrain ciabatta bun with herb cream cheese.\" The turkey looked like it was purchased from the grocery store deli, the bun was not like any ciabatta I've ever had (horribly dry and not chewy), and the cream cheese was runny - without reading the description I'd have thought it was sour cream with dried Italian seasoning dumped in it. It wasn't inedible, but the quality reminded me of something you'd pick up per-wrapped in the deli case of a supermarket for about half the price. The sweet potato fries were soggy, but had good flavor. I got a root beer which I usually enjoy in the bottle, but this was room temperature and seemed a bit thick and syrupy. They also charge for refills, which seems silly at $2.50 for about a can's worth of soda. True, I don't \"need\" more than that, but considering I can buy a four-pack of large bottles for $4 the value is lacking. I've had takeout from Sprecher a couple times prior to dining in, and I've been continuously underwhelmed. They did have some bangin' mashed potatoes that were fairly redeeming, but those don't appear to be a side choice any longer. 

SERVICE
While our server, Erin, was friendly, she was a bit of a mess. After being seated she came by about five minutes later to let us know she had no idea we were there. After she brought us our sodas, I asked for a straw and two waters. She came back with the straw pressed between her palm and one of the glasses - it just seemed a little unsanitary. 

A different blonde woman brought our food, standing silently at the end of the table holding our dishes aloft until I raised my hand to signal the dish on my side was in fact mine. They were set down without a word - no wishes to enjoy, inquiries if we needed anything else, any of the standard server banter. So awkward. Erin came back to check on us after a few minutes, and announced to us that she was going to the bathroom. Really, truly didn't need to know that. 

When she finished with her bathroom break, she came back and asked if we'd be needing a couple of boxes. We'd had our food for less than ten minutes - I'd made it about a quarter of the way through my sandwich and had only made a small dent in my fries. My dining companion had almost his entire plate of pasta left. We had come in about two hours before closing - no need for the bum's rush. 

Erin forgot about our boxes until walking by again and went to go get them - by this time we were done eating and wanted to leave. It took her about five minutes to return, standing at the POS computer and occasionally literally yelling across the dining room for another server. When she brought the boxes over I asked her to split our check. Another server came by to ask her a question and they used the end of our table as a desk. I know we were done eating but there were literally dozens of empty tables - no need to sort their papers out with us sitting at the table. 

OVERALL
I can often overlook service issues if the food is good, but my disappointing meal wasn't enough to cover up being treated like we didn't exist (or that the staff wished we didn't)."}
{"text":"Beer is pretty good, but last time service was bad."}
{"text":"They used to have one or two low carb options, but that went the way of the Wisconsin beer flood of '16. Now its just another pub, with cheese spuds taking the starring role. (and beer of course)."}
{"text":"Sprecher's is a good standby for an after work happy hour.  It is close to the office, has good happy hour specials, and decent service.  This place also has a large selection of apps which are on special during the happy hour along with the drinks.  On my most recent visit we ordered the deep fried muchrooms, cheese curds, chicken nachos, pretzel sticks and a bunch of other apps that were on the menu.  None of the items were stand out but they weren't bad either.  Because this place is so close to my office we find ourselves here a lot.  It is especially nice in the summer as they have a great patio with live bands some nights."}
{"text":"Great place to go and have a relaxed time.  The outdoor patio is a favorite of ours and sometimes there is a wait - usually not as long as we are told that it will be though so don't be scared away. They have done a great job of setting it up so that there is a bar and tables for small and large groups and making it look really pretty too.  We really enjoy sitting outside watching the band play, trying the different beers on tap and having some appetizers and dinner.  Everyone always seems to be having a good time.  The pizza's are one of my favorites and so are the soft pretzels.  The food isn't anything out of the ordinary but, it is fresh and flavorful.  My husband and I have gone here on our own and with our kids and we always have a lot of fun.  We like to sit in the bar area when patio weather has passed and we enjoy that too.  On occasion the service has been a bit off but the manager worked to try to fix any problems we have had.  Just a good place to go that isn't too expensive and have a good time with friends or family."}
{"text":"I was in Madison last weekend, got in late, and went to Sprecher's, mainly because it was right across the street from the hotel I was staying at.

The place is typical pub-type atmosphere, which to say, a bit loud. But it was Friday night and there was a game on. Friendly hostess seated me right away. Waiter was cheerful, service was good. 

I ordered the Schnitzel (pork). It came a-la Holstein, which is to say it had a fried egg on top. The sauce on the side was a lemon-caper sauce, very good, though it reminded me a lot of Veal Piccata. I've never had Schnitzel which included capers, but there's always variances in recipes. They had a Hefewiessen beer on tap which was pretty good. I left well-satisfied. 

If you're looking for good food that isn't too expensive, Sprecher's is a good choice."}
{"text":"Stopped in after finding out that I had friends hanging out here for the evening, I have to say that I will definitely go back, I really like the atmosphere, and the fact that they have a really nice outside patio is a major plus...  The drink selection was great and bar staff was really friendly..  Sat out on the patio for dinner to enjoy the music that was playing... The meal was excellent and the wine was ok..."}
{"text":"Mediocrity, Sprecher's is thy name. Aside from their retail line of delicious sodas (their root beer is top notch) and beers, they don't really have much going for them. The food is on par with what you would find at Chili's or TGIF; bland, unimaginative Americana. For Monday's happy hour specials, they have 1/2 priced apps (although the waitress told us they were $6; the check said they were 1/2 off. Very confusing.) The buffalo wings were buffalo wings in name only. I have no idea what was put in front of me. Neon orange wings that tasted like sweet and sour chicken? No thanks. The dipping trio (spinach and artichoke dip, hummus, and spicy crab dip) served with  crostini and tortilla chips (remind me never to eat tortilla chips outside of TX and CA) were fairly unimpressive and oily. If you were to come to Sprecher's, I would recommend drinking your meal. Go elsewhere to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Didn't expect this to be what it is...a traditional Wisconsin supper club.  I even got a wonderful sweet whiskey old fashioned complete with a flight of beers.  The entire family found something they liked on the menu, and the food was excellent!  The service was even better, and the way they use Yelp and text messages to tell you when your table is ready was pretty handy...there was a short wait, but who would expect anything less from such a quality Friday night supper club.  The funny thing is we only ended up here because all the usual supper clubs had no room for our party of seven.  We will definitely be back here again soon.  Thanks for a great night out Lindsey, your service was excellent!"}
{"text":"So want to like this place but every time it has been a disappointment. Beer is typically good and of course they have a decent selection but this and the patio are the only good things about this place. Food is well below average with minimal vegetation options. Service has been poor more times than not and for some reason, this place is always packed."}
{"text":"The beer and food deserve four stars. But the real draw to this place is there outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Sprecher seems to be one huge hit or miss. I've been here 3 times and have sat in the bar for all of them. The first time the bartender serving us was awesome: attentive, quick service, friendly. It was a great experience. The 2nd time we came for trivia and the service was good but not great. The 3rd time (last night) we came again for trivia and they did not have their sh*t together. Granted it was busier than I've ever seen it but that's no excuse. We had 4 different people come to our table for taking orders, none of whom had communicated with each other because they all asked if we had placed a drink order, placed a food order, needed something, etc. we also had two additional people in our party coming later, and were sitting at a table that wouldn't accommodate them. When we initially walked in, the hostess said we could just pull up chairs, which we actually had done before on a previous visit. Then we told one of our waiters that we would need to pull up chairs later on, and he told us it would be a fire hazard and we couldn't, but that he would figure something out. Well, 30 minutes later when they arrived, we had a different waiter and nothing figured out to accommodate the newbies. We stood around for about 5 minutes trying to flag down someone and no one would make eye contact!! Finally we went to grab our own chairs, and as soon as we made a move a guy came over and asked if we needed something. We said chairs and he went and grabbed them for us. 

Service was ok during trivia and after we got our food (I've never had a problem with their food, it's always been good), but our waiter was weird when we were paying. We were literally the last ones in the bar area and sat there for probably 10 minutes before he came over to let us pay. Most of us had cards, but one person had cash and when he got to that person last to pay he just stood there starring at him even though his money was out and on the table. He didn't say anything. It was strange."}
{"text":"As a beer connoisseur, collector, and Midwest representative of all things beer, I wish I had more love for Sprecher. I have been to their Milwaukee brewery, been on their tour, tasted most of their offerings and plenty of the rare stuff and still, NOPE. 

Most beer aficionados know these guys for their sodas over their beers. The food is mediocre and the staff are welcoming, but if you are looking for top notch beers this isn't your place."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because they have tasty root beer and I was excited to sample the brewery in its home state. 

The beer - delicious. I had a Hefe Weiss - light and refreshing. The root beer tastes the same as if straight from the bottle. 

That is where the good part of the experience ends. The Thai lettuce wraps taste like a lean cuisine orange chicken dish was microwaved and served with butter lettuce. Horrible. Also had the Thursday rib special - half a rack of ribs with two sides. The onion rings leave more to be desired a slightly soggy. The jalapeño slaw is just dry cabbage and jalapeño. More appropriately named a cabbage salad. 

Come for the beer, and go to a different place for the food. Spechers I expected more from you. Revamp your food to match your delicious beer."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my brew pub brats. Reminded me of my childhood in Bavaria and I've never been outside the USA. Friendly, prompt service. Clean modern atmosphere. Reasonable prices. I should have posted a picture but it didn't last long enough for that. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The food here was TERRIBLE. Really, Really bad. We had ceviche. It tasted like ketchup with chunks. I had shrimp, which was very over cooked. My husband had a hamburger which he ordered medium, but was very well done. My friend had chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken was dry and over cooked. The place was empty. I can see how the patio would be nice on a pretty night, but it was too hot to sit outside so we were stuck inside, which is like any other chain restaurant in America. The beer was fine. The service was good. Would NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Very friendly and prompt service!!! That being said, food was quite bland and overpriced. Luckily, it was happy hour otherwise I would have been very upset by the high prices. Got the ahi tuna app, and found it cumbersome and lacking in flavor. Would not recommend. 

My biggest issue was that it tasted like they didn't clean their tap lines. I can't drink beer and always order cider, so when a cider has a gritty, yeasty aftertaste I can tell when the taps aren't clean."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for dinner. Service was good and prompt. The breeze on the patio made for a nice night."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food. Not superb, not horrible. They have a great selection of apps, salads, burgers and entrées. I had the Wedge and Steak salad and was very pleased. Roasted asparagus, beets and spiced pecans accompanied my 5 oz steak cooked to order and typical wedge salad. However I had been there previously and had the flat bread. It was drowning in an oil they put on the plate. I haven't been able to test the flat bread waters again. Hopefully they have changed it up.

They get a fourth star for their patio alone. It's spacious, loaded with tables, a fire pit and they are even working on expanding the already huge patio to allow live bands in the summer.

Three cheers for a great place to enjoy the summertime on the West Side!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant. The food is very good, but there is room for improvement. I would say that this is an excellent place to grab a salad for lunch, their salads are outstanding and you get a good portion. The appetizers are also very good and although you'd never think to get it, I recommend the hot pretzel, it's the best you'll find anywhere. Last but not least, they have great beers that they brew themselves (try the Abbey Tripel or Hefeweizen).

The service is also good most of the time. We've had an experience or two with a lackluster waiter or waitress, but they have an Asst Manager named Matt that is incredibly friendly and helpful and he will be quick to right any wrong you encounter.

P.S. If you go there during the summer, they have an INCREDIBLE outdoor patio! A+ for that!"}
{"text":"I cannot recall a more frustrating dining experience. Starting with the 3 staff being unable to run the host station with empty tables throughout. Orders took forever to arrive, and we were not the only ones who waited well over an hour for basic orders to arrive. No acknowledgement or apologies for delay. Bill came, and after waiting further, finally had to go to host station to actually get the hell out. Group who never got seated left at same time and stopped another large party walking from hotel across street to warn them. At least they were saved, as I saw them turning heel to find alternative. Have always been fan of their brew but will never return to restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly service can't save bland, overpriced food. 

+1 star for friendly service. Our waiter was very cheerful and attentive. He disappeared for a bit, but, just when his absence seemed his defining characteristic, he flew back into action with panache and style. The manager was also checking up on everyone and helping out where needed. Nice people!

+0 stars for food. I really wanted to like this place, but the food was bad from top to bottom:
- cheese curds were bad (how does this even happen in Wisconsin?!), 
- the Rueben was bad (strangely sweet, very strangely), 
- the kid's chicken breast was bad (too tough to cut), and 
- the Rathskeller pasta was bad (flavorless). 
The food wasn't offensive enough to flip over any tables or start a prolonged argument with the hostess on the meaning of life and why they had just stolen so much of mine, it was just nowhere near as good as it should have been or as the Sprecher name implies. Apparently the pizza was okay.

TL;DR. Buy Sprecher root beer and a low-sodium  microwaveable feast at the grocery store and you've just recreated the dining experience I just had."}
{"text":"Nice family style restaurant. 
We had scotch eggs and tuna thai wrap lettuce and pretzels....the eggs were great...the wrap not so much, the pretzels were DELICIOUS. I had the bbq chicken flat bread and it was good, very filling. One of my friends had the brew burger and she loved it, my other friend had the dish tacos that she enjoyed. I also tried their signature root beer, it was good, but I didn't feel the need to order another one. 
The service was good, the host was attentive, he provided us with the seating we requested....the waiter was on point, no delays and very engaging. Overall, i would come back."}
{"text":"Sprecher's restaurant just opened off greenway blvd. They serve the well known Sprecher's brand of beer and root beer.  I ordered the 8 oz fillet mignon with house salad, sprecher's beer cheese potatoes and grilled asparagus. 

The house salad was everything I was looking for with mixed greens, bacon and some cheese. The croutons were even delicious. 

When the steak arrived I was expecting the sides to be along the sides of the plate but was surprised and actually impressed tontine they had made a nice layered arrangement out of the items i ordered.  Presentation was great and the food was outstanding. They use a wood fire grill which gives the steak an amazing earthy flavor. There is a sweet brown 'juos' I suppose it would be called that comes with it.  The potatoes are like a cheese scalloped but better. 

 The beer i drank was the heffe and it was quite nice and in large quantity for 3.50 during happy hour. 

Finally for dessert I got what they call a 'mini' creme brûlée for 3$. Thisnis actually a pretty good sized dish much larger that the bite size I was expecting.  It was not overdone and tasted great. Seriously a steal at 3 dollars!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Ordered fish and chips! Fish was soggy. The server got tied up talking to a guy in the booth next to me. Waited a few minutes until I could ask for some malt vinegar!"}
{"text":"Womp womp. Just stopped in here. Was seated in the bar and waited for 15 minutes without so much as a glance from the five waitstaff and bartender who were in the bar bar area at the time. Disappointed..have been wanting to stop in for a long time."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The cream soda my husband was looking forward to tasted watered down.  He said his fish tacos had no flavor.  The same for the sauerbraten. There was no hot sauce or salsa for the fish tacos.  Tabasco sauce was offered but never delivered. My husband thought the name Sprechters would live up to their brand.  There is no sense describing each parcel of food as it all was bland and we are not picky eaters.  The only thing we got out of our $40 lunch was full.  The wait staff was friendly.  This is one of those \"been there, no need to go back\" places.  They have a large menu but we have no interest in trying again.  The dogs are getting my leftovers as I ate less than1/4 of my $16.99 meal."}
{"text":"Second visit to Sprecher in Madison. I've been to the brewery in Milwaukee a few times as well. Quality beer and food as well. First time, my wife and I had burgers during their burger and beer special during the week. Very tasty burgers. I had the one with cheese curds. Delicious. 

Our second visit brought us in for the Old Fashioned Fish Fry special for $12. Excellent deal. You get a choice between three drinks with your either baked or fried cod fish dinner. You can choose an old fashion, beer or soda. The fried fish dinner comes with three pieces of cod and a choice of two sides. I had onion rings and the jalapeño slaw. One of the best fried cod fish dinners I've ever had. The cod was perfectly deep fried with a nice crunchy batter. Loved it. 

My wife had the wedge salad along with a beer cheese soup. I had a taste of the soup and it was very tasty. She also had a brandy slush, which was delicious too. 

Great meal and price too. We'll be back. No wait either for a Friday night around 6pm."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Had cheese beer soup, not so good. Brat fries were great with root beer mustard sauce. Margarita was great"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice, but the food was terrible.  Everyone I was with disliked the food.  It's very obvious that the kitchen staff is trying to be super cheap.  The nachos had a LOT of chips, but almost no toppings.  The meat dishes had almost no meat, but copious amounts of potatoes (which were horrible and bland) and cheap sides.  The schnitzel was like eating breaded shoe leather.  The flat breads were incredibly expensive for a mediocre frozen pizza like dish.
The outdoor patio is awesome though.  It's a great place to grab a drink, but you shouldn't get anything to eat unless you're really hard up."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't been said before.  Food was good (not super great) but service was severely lacking.  They have a variety of food options, and some good pics for lunch, but nothing overly awesome.  

The one plus:  Sprecher's root beer on tap.  Worth the trip for that.  So good!"}
{"text":"Restaurants on Madison's west side are booming.  Sprechers was actually are third stop after 2 other places had waits of 30 and 60 minutes on a Thursday night.
My gf and I both really enjoyed our salads (see pic).  I gave the hard root beer a try since I love the regular stuff, but I wont be drinking that again.  It was way to sweet.
Service was fine.  Our waitress was being trained in...I think her trainer could have backed off a little bit...
All in all an enjoyable experience at this location which once housed Hulahans, rated Madison's dirtiest restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...a little dark and loud...but then what bar/resturant isn't.  Food was great.  My and my son's burger was a little well done, but that might have been due to the large business crowd that was there getting lunch and watching the Big 10 game.   The staff is pleasing, polite, and professional.  Kids like it due to their own brewed sodas.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food and beer is a 4, but it's got one of the best patios in Madison.  That's worth a 5."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for supper because we genrally enjoy the food here. My husband went to use the bathroom and our appetizer came.As my daughter and I got started on the nachos,  my husband returned to our table and told us not to eat any more because he was in the bathroom and the cook was right next to him and left the bathroom without bothering to wash his hands and went directly back to working in the kitchen. 

My husband confronted the manager about it and she seemed not to even care. She said that the employees don't have to wash their hands until they return to the kitchen! That is against every food safety rule i have ever heard.  
Needless to say we left and will never return."}
{"text":"I've dined inside, dined outside, and enjoyed food and beverages around one of the fire pits in the evening. They do a great job overall.

Everything I have eaten on the menu is delicious and properly prepared. One of their best specials occurs on Sundays. They have $6 appetizers all day, which really is a great deal. Those appetizers run anywhere from $7 to $12 other days of the week. I often come here with a friend and his wife and children, and we just order a bunch of apps to share. Last time, I tried the buffalo wings for the first time. Yum! They were slathered with a cross between a traditional creamy buffalo sauce and an almost sweet and sour flavor. There was definitely a hint of sriracha flavor as well. I'll be ordering those again. The quesadilla and nachos are also big hits.

The outdoor area is a great place to enjoy some apps and drinks on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. They do have live music on some evenings, and that can make for a pleasant experience if you like the band.

Service is usually great, but watch out for sitting around the fire pits. My group found the service to be a little uneven the night we were hanging out around them. In addition, you realize that it is hard to socialize around pits that big, and even more awkward to try to eat when leaning back in an Adirondack chair. I suggest eating first then relaxing there later."}

{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Sprecher's yet because they are a hidden gem in some ways that people in the Madison area should frequent more often.

Why do I say that?  Their outdoor patio.  It is fantastic, easily my favorite in Madison.  It can occasionally get busy but of the dozen or so times I've been there it's usually very comfortable and not crowded.  They have firepit tables, trickling ponds, a big lively central bar where people are always having a great time, TVs for the games, and a live band on most weekends.

I think the spacing is crucial, everything just feels very open and welcoming.  On a nice summer day where you want one of their delicious cool beverages and some food, they have you covered.  The bands they have vary, but they always play at an appropriate conversation volume which I see many restaurants get wrong (I'm looking you Claddagh!).  And the music is agreeable to a wide range in my opinion; often folk or bluesy stuff, not hard rock, metal, or rap.  Not that there's anything wrong with those genres, but this planned choice makes them more accessible without a doubt.

If you're a meat eater you'll want to get one of their burgers; nothing terribly exceptional but one of the better menu choices and you get your money's worth.  Their cheese curds, nachos, and other bar style appetizers are reasonable too.  That's about where I stop with the food train, because unfortunately most of the other dishes I've had were a big miss or overly expensive for my budget.  Burgers and Apps will keep you in the $10-12 or less per item range, but most dinners are $15 and up, so the bill gets high fast.  And at that price I'd like to be wow'd a bit more.  Everything on their menu sounds tasty, but the execution in my experience has just been off.  And friends have echoed this as well so it's not just my own interpretations.

Service can be good at times or just ok, I'd like to see more consistency on that end but the last few times I've been have been positive.  Sometimes it seems like they have too many people staffed, looking bored or wandering around aimlessly when my party is sitting waiting for drinks/food or a table.  Orders have been occasionally wrong, but again nothing recently on that front.  These are easily improvable areas, they seem to be on the right track, and nothing has been terrible so I'm happy to keep returning for that beautiful patio.

That's the gist of it, if you haven't been please make a point to get there before the summer is over.  The patio is just fantastic, and while parts of the inside are nice too, the outdoor section is just something you can't miss."}

I just wanted to express my disappointment with the service.  We were here two years ago passing through town and the service was terrible.  

We decided to stop again today since we were in town for a hockey tournament and unfortunately I have to say there was no improvement to the service, slow to be seated, slow to be waited upon and slow to get our food.  Also, my wife 's potato soup was very watered down.  

I thought there would be improvement but not even close."}
{"text":"Okay service.  It was like giving the hostess a 2000 piece puzzle in order to figure out how to seat 7 of us.  With that said, even as we asked to be seated some where that would be much more \"roomy\", that seemed complicated.  Food is amazing though!  The chefs definitely know what they are doing.  Recommend for sure, especially for groups, but just be patient."}
{"text":"Sprecher always sounds like a good idea, and I always go in with high hopes only to leave feeling slightly disappointed with the food.

The menu has a great variety and everything sounds good, but when you get your food it's always just okay...nothing special or memorable.

I go here for the atmosphere more than anything. The outdoor area is super nice.  There are tons of tables  with comfortable seating including some with fire pits in the middle. The outdoor bar has huge TVs and fans.  It's a really cool place to hang out and great for groups!  Did I mention that the happy hour prices are amazing?  $3 for a beer!  

They have lots unique drink options.  The alcoholic ginger beer is very good and refreshing on a hot summer day.  The alcoholic root beer isn't very good; I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch here at Sprecher's. The beer flight was Huge! but the choices were ice cold and flavorful. I had a wonderful burger (medium, touch of pink within) on a soft delicious brioche bun. My daughter had the beer cheese soup and both were dynamite. I would skip on the sweet potato fries next time - soggy and bland. But the burger was so good, I didn't care. There's outdoor seating in good weather and TV's in the bar area. Their homemade root beer and sorbet made the most delicious float I've ever ever had. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Gosh, do I ever want to love this place as they have one of the best outdoor patios on the west side.  But despite many visits service is always hit or miss and food is just mediocre.  Ok spot for happy hour, especially in the summer on the patio."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good prices, craft beers, big portions and some inventive food items add up to a good casual bar experience with Wisconsin flair (beer battered brats and cheese curds on a burger.)   The patio is great in good weather.  All in all a good alternative to chains, just don't expect great food or service.  
Service is a bit erratic based on my two experiences here.
My lunch special schnitzel arrived almost cool, but a burger came out in less time than Mac Donald's.   I never got a real napkin or silverware one time either. - just a handful of bar napkins.  Oh well, the burger was good."}
