{"text":"In a word...  Deliciosos! 

Good food....  Probably will not do an order of chips with salsa next time...  For $3 it was nothing special at all.  But the rest was tasty.  The service was prompt, but none too friendly.  When you consider that we weren't there to make friends, we came to enjoy Mexican food...  We still won.  :-)"}
{"text":"The bean burritos are fantastic, but my current favorite is a bean tostada with the green sauce. Delicious. Have a drink next door at the Closing Soon Saloon. They'll let you bring the food in."}
{"text":"Loved the 7 Seas Soup and the Ceviche Tostada."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican food! I had pork carnitas, my husband had fish tacos, and both were very good and came with an avocado sauce that was wonderful. Great place for quick, no fuss lunch. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"When I moved here back in June 2016, I found this place right down the street for me.   Before I could get my kitchen together and cook in the hot summer weather, I came here to eat.  The food is good and very reasonable, even with the recent price increases, the first in many years, I've been told.  So, despite eating here at least five times a week for the first couple of months here, and being a regular since, I have never tired of this establishment,

In the past fifteen months I have eaten almost everything on the menu.  My favorites are the tacos, the soups, the seafood tostada, and the salsa bar.  The tacos are a bargain at $1.60 each.  I love that they use two tortillas for each taco, ask if you want them with onions and cilantro (yes!), and that there are numerous taco filling options. My favorites are carne asada, al pastor  and lengua.  So, I get my three tacos with chips, hit the salsa bar filled with three salsas, radishes, cauliflower-carrot-pepper mix, and grilled hot peppers, get a horchata and pay less than $8 for a complete, nutritious meal. What a deal, and it all tastes scrumptious.

Another favorite is menudo, available on Saturdays and Sundays until it runs out.  If you want some, get there early,  This stuff disappears fast.  I love when the menudo is made with tendon--fantastic.  The seafood soup is also lovely, with all kinds of seafood, corn, potatoes and cabbage in a well seasoned, slightly spicy broth.  It is one of the priciest items on the menu, but still a good value at around $12.  

This place sells Mexican coke and other Mexican drinks, and has tap water for those who don't want to pay for a drink.  It's frequented by primarily Mexicans and a fair amount of gringos.  It does a brisk business, is clean and modern and has an extensive menu.  Go in, get some tacos, radishes, and peppers, a Mexican coke, sit back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ate here. It's cheap but you get what you pay for. It's exactly what it seems like from the moment you walk in. 
No complaints, but don't expect a hidden gem."}
{"text":"A lot of great delicious food for your money.  Will definitely return if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"los peores tacos que he comido en vida, pedí tacos de tripa, chorizo pastor y asada y nada bueno, la tripa la pedí dorada y estaba cocida, el chorizo crudo, la asada parecía ground beef, y el pastor sabia a todo menos a pastor,  la verdad no vuelvo a ir a ese lugar no lo recomiendo, muy mala experiencia"}
{"text":"Some people might be picky about what \"authentic\" Mexican food should be but this place covers all the bases for me.  Nice kind Mexican staff, amazing meat choices for tacos, imported sodas and amazing sauces and salsas.  I had the 3 taco plate ( lengua, tripas and carne) and I haven't felt that satisfied after only 3 tacos in how long.  Great prices too not to mention, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Found this joint on yelp and it didn't disappoint! The food was great! I recommend this hole in the wall to everyone! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow wa. Yes a hole in the wall but you will leave fulfilled. Best tasting Mexican food in a long long time. Don't forget to fill up on condiments table. You will complete your meal! Gal behind counter English not so good but who cares! Order was excellent. Food excellent and you still had money left in your pocket. If you don't go you will miss a Phoenix/Scottsdale experience."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. They have all the classics and they are executed well. They also carry Mexican coke, and sidral mundet apple soda. I recommend the gordita combo. Only negative thing is I've gotten to go food from here and they gave me the wrong order."}
{"text":"GREAT food! The place is small, but the price is right! I had the steak burrito combo and it was so flavorful. The rice and beans were fantastic.  The guacamole wasn't quite my thing but that's just my personal preference. I will certainly be back. Don't be fooled by the building, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I grew up in Tucson eating some Mexican classics off Main avenue. This little gem located in my backyard had all the classics. I opted for the #1 with Tripas. It brought me right back to my childhood. Delicious food, amazing salsa bar and first class service!"}
{"text":"This might be the best Mexican food ever. It's really good. Finally tried it out, and yeah the location is a little shady. It probably would have helped me a lot if I knew Spanish, but still got some awesome tacos!"}
{"text":"The perfect place to get an authetic bite of mexican food. Taco bell and chipotle can't compare to how amazing this place is. The service is always good, the food is stellar, and the prices are dirt cheap. If I want a burrito, taco, side of beans, platter, ceviche, ANYTHING. I go here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town from NYC and wanted to try a local taco spot. We had lunch at Tacos Jalisco and, while the exterior doesn't look like much, the food is exceptional! Between the two of us we enjoyed the carne asada, churizo, pollo and carnitas tacos as well as the chips & guacamole. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. We especially enjoyed the salsa that came on top of the carne asada tacos (also available at the salsa bar), it had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it. 

If you're in the area, this place is definitely worth trying out. I wish we could convince them to come to NYC!"}
{"text":"I love divey taquerias for their authenticity and delicious tacos. This was not one of them. The beans and rice were not edible. The salsas were so salty you couldn't use them. And the tacos were also salty yet flavorless."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos, but the real reason to visit Tacos Jalisco is the horchata. 


Let me emphasize this: the horchata at Tacos Jalisco is the best horchata I have ever had.  Apparently, they make it from \"scratch\" whereas many other places make it from a pre-made mix. It's addictive."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My boyfriend lived in Guadalajara Mexico for 2.5 years and was dying for a good torta in Arizona.  I must admit that it is tough to find and we drove by the place like 3 times before we found it; it was worth it though!  The place is tiny and only has 20 seats, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. I spoke English but my boyfriend went to town ordering in Spanish, both ways were welcome.  The food is truly authentic and everything we ordered was delicious.  I suggest the green salsa especially if you like it hot. This will become a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Chicken taco was good, but the carne asada burrito tasted horrible. Also, there was a roach climbing up the wall halfway through lunch which pretty much ended it for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The cheap, gritty Mexican food we were looking for. Alpastor tacos were real good.  Less than 9 bucks for 5 tacos!"}
{"text":"Yelp doesn't lie. I almost didn't go in based on the look of the place. Don't let that stop you. I had a quesadilla and chorizo taco. It was so good I thanked the woman at the register on the way out. The large horchata is LARGE. Excellent food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a good first experience here a few weeks ago but after going tonight, we will not be back.

We walked in tonight and the lady ringing us up had a horrible attitude for no reason. We asked a couple questions about the menu and we got one word answers and a glaring stare.

She made us feel really uncomfortable and unwelcomed in the restaurant almost as if she didn't want us there.

Kind words to the business owner, have a sit down with your cashier and tell her to find another job if she does not want to represent the front of your restaurant in an appropriate way.

All it takes is one bad experience for a customer to not bring you their business again, and that's all it took in this case.

I'll opt for Chipotle next time as I know exactly what in getting every time I walk into one of their restaurants"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! They have a salsa bar with picked jalepenos and carrots too. Salsa is great. Four huge tacos and two waters for $8.60"}
{"text":"Great place! Nice service. Nice taco shop. Good rellenos and tostadas, a must stop when around Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Beef tacos were very good (4-star). Guacamole was runny and had some rind/pit in it.  Other sides were just OK."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great neighborhood spot. It's affordable and quick. I usually get the carne asada burrito but the camarones a la diabla are really good too."}
{"text":"I'll make this a quick one -- Lengua, Chorizo with cheese and egg burrito. Nine taco special. You cannot go wrong with these."}
{"text":"Great Tacos. Authentic and small with your choice of a variety of meats with cilantro, onions and spicy salsas. We had the chicken and steak and they were outstanding. The chicken enchiladas were terrific and a great surprise. What holds this place back from a solid 5 stars is the guacamole which is a soupy, watery mess.  Also, and more minor, since the food is the star here, but I'd love if the smell of the bathrooms were less present in the back of the restaurant. We ended up having to move because of it. Worth the trip"}
{"text":"This place was great.  The food was delicious, the service was good.  I had the taco and gordita with beef asado, and loved it."}
{"text":"This is a gem in the Scottsdale area. I had the torta and taco meal, which was a huge portion for about $8. Not only was it good Mexican, it was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had outside of Mexico. 

Don't bother reading more reviews, just go here and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been eating here going on 10 years now. Their food is consistently good. The salsa ranchera is fantastic, roasted jalapeños and pickled jalapeños with carrots and cauliflower are the best. The standouts are the 7 seas soup, goat tacos, and carne asada tacos. I wish they would ad pasole to the menu."}
{"text":"Wow...if you want authentic Mexican food, this is the one.  Don't expect a fancy restaurant but the food is incredible."}
{"text":"This is an authentic taco shop! And one of the best in this area! The staff is amazing. They have a full AMAZING menu. You must see to believe. They have a smoky salsa, and I have never had anything like their regular salsa. Roasted Jalapenos on the salsa bar as well as mini limes. Sopes with chicken and Sopes with Pastor (seasoned pork) are AMAZING. Tacos are wonderful street style. Their beans come topped with a nice white cheese! Flavors are off the charts for a casual taco shop. Must see for yourself. Parking lot was full. Don't be shy. Must try."}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place sooner... Clean, fast, and REAL Mexican food! I had the torta and taco, and left a very satisfied customer. Big thank you to the  woman in the back cooking, your food was great."}
{"text":"I tried this place out based on reviews I read from multiple sources.  Luckily one of the reviews mentioned that it was right next to a circle K, this made it fairly easy to spot.

I ordered the 3 tacos combination plate with carne asada, carnitas, and lengua.  All were delicious, though I have had better asada.  I chose not to partake in anything from the condiment bar, that will be on the next visit.  The beans and rice were good.  I was extremely disappointed that they did not sell beer, and I can't believe that a fast-food Mexican place closes at 12 am.  This would be the perfect stop after getting kicked out of the bars at 2 am if it was open.

All in all, great choice for fast food Mexican, but I would not say it was extraordinary."}
{"text":"This food is terrible!!! It is so salty, it's inedible. The burritos are a major disappointment, don't bother! I can't find one nice thing to say about their food, maybe good lettuce. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"The carne asada super nachos are 100% heavenly bliss!!!  I've been going to this place for years and will always come back.  This place blows all those \"bertos\" places out of the water.  The service is always friendly and the food fresh.  While they do make a good burrito... Try the amp market down the street if you want one cause they are the best in town."}
{"text":"Loved this place. My wife and I requested vegetarian burritos and they happily obliged.  They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Tacos Jalisco? More like Tacos Jalisc-NO. The place is a small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint, and boy does it smell like one. Upon entering the dining area, ones senses are consumed by the overwhelming stench of bathroom, which leaks from the poorly enclosed area at the establishments rear. A sizable portion of the tacos were inedible grizzle, and the bean burrito banished the only chunk of cheese to one small section on the bottom, growing like a small cold tumor from one side. The chips were store bought and the bottled sodas were nearly expired, which is completely mind boggling. The prices were high compared to similar places, and I left with nothing but sadness filling my stomach. Needless to say, not planning a return visit."}
{"text":"Definitely the best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had - previous review likened the cheese to crack - that is no joke (not that I know what crack is like, but still).
Hole in the wall - easy to drive by if you aren't looking for it.
Carne asada taco was great, too.  Was just ok on the rice and refritos that came on the side.
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Old, funky Mexican food place that feels and tastes like Mexico. We went here based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. It's very small - 4-5 tables but we got a place to sit. Everything is in Spanish with minimal English references. It was just good, cheap food. 2 of us ate for less than $20. Where does that happen in Scottsdale. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late taco, and was pleasantly surprised of the quality of food for the price.  Got several dishes to-go and all were excellent: chips and salsa were good; bean&cheese burrito large and great; carne asada burrito was excellent."}
{"text":"The best taco shop in south scottsdale whenever around Il stop in for there famous el pastor burrito"}
{"text":"We were in town and wanted authentic Mexican tacos; family type, no frills. We saw great reviews for this place and headed straight for our taco feast. The place is clean, the salsa bar really good. The food was authentic and my husband was happy to get his tripa fix. Great food! The only downside and first impression was the cashier taking our order. She must hate her job!! No smile, barely answered our questions, very unwelcoming. OWNERS!!! Please train your staff to be welcoming. I may not want to come here again knowing I'll get a frown face.  I went back to see more reviews and we're not the only ones getting the frown face. Food is great, if only the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've had in the valley so far I've been here four years.Authentic and Perfect!"}
{"text":"Not a fan and I really wanted to be. I didn't even finish my taco plate. I have no problem eating from a hole in the wall, but something about the food here just turned me off. The rice had a strange taste to it and the meat seemed as low quality as the look of the restaurant. I had a grilled chicken, carne asada and pork taco plate. The pork was the best of the 3, but the chicken and carne asada tasted a bit like zoo animal smells. It could have been the marinade too, but whatever it was, it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Hidden gem exposed busy coworkers at new company now go every week. Great sauces and salsa."}
{"text":"Plaza looks sketchy, but it's safe. This is where day laborers eat.  They have the *best* carrot, jalapeno, cauliflower mix on their condiment bar, not the same boring stuff you get at just about every other \"real\" Mexican dive. They have 3 basic salsas: green, red, and smokey red.  Try them all to find your favorite.

My favorite dish is the breakfast plate with chorizo. This is chorizo that you can actually taste, not the stuff you find at many places that tastes like hamburger. The lunch items are very good, too. Like any dive, it might take a few tries to find your favorite dishes.

And the menudo (weekends) is about as real as it gets.  I.e. Excellent."}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 stars. Good value for the money. Nothing fancy. Very clean inside. Prompt counter service. Food pretty good.  We had chili reneno, torta & taco. Comes with sides. Guacamole & beans good. Rice had odd taste to me. Didn't like the big glob of mayo on my lettuce & tomato. I'm sure I can tell them to leave it off next time."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this place! Stumbled upon them on Yelp when another taco place I was craving wasn't open. The menu is plastered all over the wall so you will immediately notice the fair price points for all their dishes. I ordered street tacos and a quesadilla.  Both were phenomenal, the rice and beans are also top quality. 

As I was walking away with my to-go order, the chef yelled after me to let me know that he had put sour cream on my tacos, \"Was that okay, or do you want me to re-make them\"? You just don't get service like that everywhere. 

Great Job Taco Jalisco, You are looking like my new GO-TO taco spot.  

***Easter Egg*** 
The Carne Asada street tacos come loaded with meat and not one, but 2 tortillas stacked together. It's like getting 2 for the price of 1"}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD OUTSIDE OF MEXICO!!! Seriously tho you should only come here. The prices are super low and the quality is stellar. Lengua tacos FTW. Don't miss the salsa bar with roasted and salted jalapeño peppers. Not for the faint of heart!"}
{"text":"Sketchy tacos in Scottsdale? No, you say? Oh yes there are! Some of the best tacos in Phoenix are right down the street.  (There's even a scary bar next door if you're into that kind of thing.) The menu here isn't fancy but offers a wide array of favorites.  I tried the #10 combo, that's one street taco and a cheese quesadilla.  All the combos are served up with rice, beans, salad (well, lettuce with tomatoes and a big splooge of mayo--- ew! The only thing on my plate that didn't get totally devoured.  Y'all know I hate mayonnaise!!!), and that yummy green dip (I don't know what its officially called, but if you're Texican you'll recognize it.  Its like blended sour cream and chilies.) The quesadilla was pretty good, and more than enough for most large mammals.  But the star on my dinner plate was the carne asada taco-- omg, it was amazing! Next time I'm getting the three taco combo.  Their tacos are just right.  Not too greasy, not too spicy (although they'll make them that way if you ask).  Just the right amount of meat, onions, cilantro, and sauce for maximum flavor.  They have fresh cut limes on the salsa bar-- absolutely essential for my taco enjoyment.  Be careful of the marinated carrots, they are really marinated and hot, hot, hot.  They're flavorful, but you might be regretting that choice later on.  
If I have a complaint, it is only that they don't have a coke fountain dispenser,  only cans or bottles.  That can become rather pricey if you get a hold of something spicy (especially if its unintentionally!)  
The prices are reasonable compared with similar restaurants in the area, although a bit pricier than what I'm used to.  For whatever reason, Mexican food is more expensive in Arizona than in Texas or Kentucky.  This place is better than most if the Mexican food I've had out here, though, so I'm not going to gripe about it too much.  If the quality is there, I don't mind paying a little more.  
The quality is definitely there, and I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in AZ! I've been on the look out for a great Mexican and this is without a doubt the best. The service is great, the food AMAZING and you cannot beat the price. 

I love that they get your order out right away and have soo many options of salsa. The torta is by far my favorite and the Chiles Rellenos are great as well. Anything you order from here will impress you. I live on the west side so it's a little far for me, but definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Yelp comes through again.  Tacos Jalisco is SOOO good.  I was skeptical of the Styrofoam trays, and not sure if the lady taking my order understood what I was ordering (I had to repeat myself a few times), but what came from the kitchen was exactly what I wanted on my trip to Phoenix.  

Carne Asada came highly recommended, as did the quesadilla, so we followed suit and were so pleased  Carne Asada is so well seasoned and chopped, with a just that little  bit of char that you really look for. I could have used more tortillas, but I made do.  The quesadilla came with a a little carne asada taco on top, and was enormous.  It was not the typical one big flour tortilla folded in half, and grilled, there was much more thought put into this than I really expected.  How much thought can you give to a tortilla and cheese?  Apparently more than I had considered.   Plus, it came with a little carne asada taco on the side, which was an unexpected bonus.  It came with guacamole (don't order a side of guac unless, you really need a quart), beans and rice. the beans were good and the rice was fantastic.  

Ambiance, was pretty basic, table wobbled, chairs were simple, and Spanish language music videos were playing on the TV, but that kind of added to the charm.

I'm from the north (and not Latino), so I don't have a lot of quality Mexican food to compare it to, but it shall now be the mark by which all other Mexican food shall be measured."}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada plate! So much TASTE in the marinaded steak! about $7 and I ordered NO CHEESE due to my lactose intolerance and they were very curtious and took my request seriously. I will be going back to this hole in the wall and the lady behind the counter recommended that I get the Burrito and Taco combo next time!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. Hole in the wall place but not good. The carne was not good , beans were like soup and so was the guacamole.. Rice was also not good either. I don't even know how this place has good reviews. Also it smelled nasty in the part when you sit down and eat your food. Seems good for construction workers who are really hungry because that's all there was in there!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Scottsdale. I usually have their carne asada tacos or tortas, which are both delicious. I could write 10 more reviews dedicated to how good their salsa is. Their flan and horchata are also off the chain. Only complaint is that last time I got take out they put beans on my torta which kinda ruined it lol. Still love this place though."}
{"text":"This place is right down the road from me, and is always on point.   Service is fast and always consistent.  I usually get tacos con todo, which have been on point every time i get them, good size for the price and always nice and warm and ready to go, plenty of flavor. Salsa bar has your standard green, pico, and red hot. Ive gotten to go orders as well and have nothing bad to say, great work keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"i can give up smoking,  drugs, meth, liquor,sex, even MY LIIIIIFFEE... but not tacos jaliscos... especially not the #1 on the menu..."}
{"text":"Ok peeps i'm not gonna lie, this place is pretty good.

Little bit of a shady neighborhood. We went at night, though, and had no problems.

Had carne asada sope and carne asada taco. I agree with my fellow Yelpers, the carne asada is pretty flavorful. Not crazy about the rice and watery guacamole but the beef was 2-thumps up"}
{"text":"Great local hole in the wall. Staff is always friendly. I'm not huge on their sea food but their carne asada is amazing! I usually stop in for a breakfast burrito or breakfast dish (which are all very reasonably priced) or grab the 9 carne asada taco platter and save some for leftovers. Make sure you try out their salsas when you go in. For me at least, the salsa is what makes the food. Been going here regularly for over 6 years. I have yet to take someone there that didn't want to go back."}
{"text":"Just ok place. Not impressed.
My boyfriend lives his carnitas taco. I ordered a taco de Tripa and a taco de lengua. Lengua was dry and not very tasty, but the Tripa was good."}
{"text":"This place is original mexican. I had 3 carne asada tacos and they were super tasty. All of their salsas are good too. Decent place."}
{"text":"Never been to Mexico, but when I think of how the food might be, this is exactly what comes to mind. I had three tacos pastor, rice beans and guac. The pastor was incredibly seasoned, wrapped in two fresh, hand made corn tortillas and had a little cheese. came with a side of lettuce, tomato and crema but I didn't want to ruin a good meaty taco with veggies. Definitely do not judge this place by it's appearance. And in my travels, the best food is usually behind some shady lookin doors!"}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite Mexican take out place when we just want quick and delicious Mexican food! It's fresh and they give good portions!"}
{"text":"We found this cool little hole in the wall taco restaurant, thanks to all of you  yelpers!! They have a great selection of Mexican food. The food was delicious !"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant but the food was very good and at a great price. Service was quick and friendly, salsa bar was clean and well stocked. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"True hole in the wall.  Tacos Jalisco tastes much better than it looks.  I tried the asada, carnitas, tripas, and pastor tacos.  In order from best to worst:
Tripas- flavorful, tender, i like them a bit more crunchy but they were very good
Pastor- the pinneapple flavore really shined and they were pretty tender
Asada- a bit boring and on the dry side.  Would have been good had it been fresher and right off the grill
Carnitas- also would have been better if they were warmed on the grill first.  A bit dry and I bit into grissle more than once.

There were three salsas at the bar as well as pickled carrots and jalapenos, raidshes, limes, and roasted jalapenos.  The three salsas were seriously legit.  Two reds and a green and they each held their own.

All in all it is a dive spot with tasty salsas and okay tacos.  I would go back again if I was in the area to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This was a meal that took place after an extra inning baseball game I was watching at the local watering hole, but that should not affect the review, but it might have affected the ordering process. First off how many drunken people eating here or take-out (like my meal) thought that the giant dollop of white stuff on top of my patch of lettuce was sour cream? I'm guessing 99% and until I actually find the one place in some random corner of Mexico that uses this technique, let's just say this is weird and luckily I had read reviews first. #sourcreamplease
     The quesadilla and asada taco combo was my choice, but I thought I had said I wanted the carne asada taco, but she said \"Ok beef? Yes, they are the same, but not in the Mexican world. The meat did not taste like asada or any other meat I have tasted before, including \"beef\". Either way it had no fat and was double wrapped and decent. The quesadilla was big and standard fare for these things, but better than the chains version. The rice was high quality and fresh radishes are always a nice touch.Whether I slurred my words or we had a translation issue we will never know, but overall the place appears to be better than the chains, but that's about all."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The tacos are my favorite. I like the al pastor, carne asada, and chorizo. Staff is very friendly and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Oh man. The carne asada is so flavorful and juicy--best I've ever had! (It's pretty fatty, though...which is probably why it tastes so good.) I usually get the #4, which is one small taco, two tostadas, plus rice and beans. It's so much food and lasts me two or three meals. I'm generally \"so so\" on tostadas, but these are amazing! Their house fried shells topped with asada and salsa is HEAVEN! It's hard to believe something so seemingly simple can be so good, but trust me on this!!

Their green salsa is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life! I have no clue what they put in it, but I CAN say it's not the typical tomatillo-heavy green salsa (which is good, don't get me wrong); it's the most unique and delicious hot sauce in the world! I could eat it with a spoon!"}
{"text":"I am from the Bay, so I have had some of the greatest mexican, more importantly, street tacos ever..... And tacos Jalisco kills it! Everything on the menu is what's up! 

I usually get the 3 taco plate: uno carnitas, dos al pastor. They have bomb burritos too! The meat is succulent and spiced perfectly! 

I love how the location is a hole in the wall next to a dive called the the last call.

By far the best mexican food in the valley!... Sad to see the location on Osborn and Scottsdale go :( 

Vive la taco Jalisco!"}
{"text":"Al pastor was one of the best I've ever had. Their tortillas are quality too. All together makes for a delicious burrito. I'd skip the carne asada fries though. They should make al pastor fries instead."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go easy authentic mexican food at a very good price. Very good food!!!!"}
{"text":"No doubt, hands down the BEST hole in the wall mexican food. So damn good, you won't see Joe Arpio here! I've come here since the 80's! The smokey salsa will have you addicted and you will make long trips to get here! The carne asada is juicy, tender and flavorful.  The tacos are chucked full of meat and cheese, they never skimp on anything they serve you. The beans are smooth and creamy and add some of the hot sauce, perfect dip combo! I always order extra when I visit as I have moved out of the area years ago, and it's along ways over. And mostly I just don't want the ride to be over so soon, I want to continue the Fiesta my taste buds are having for at least another meal! The prices are awesome for $10.00 you get a plateful here! The service is good too always treated kindly and efficiently."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. I know everyone else seems to think this place is worth 5 stars, but I have to disagree. And after my experience, I read the other reviews that were 3 stars or less and they had the same things to say that I did so I know I'm not completely out of my mind. Maybe since it's next to a dive bar, the people there get really hungry after a few drinks and they don't know any better. 

I've been spending a lot of time in Mexico lately and have been eating some amazing inexpensive Mexican food. So I do know what it is supposed to taste like. So here are the specifics to back up my claim. Torta-Wrong kind of bun. They should be on bolillo bread, something with some bite to it and chewey and crusty, not a soft, mushy, square shaped hamburger bun kind of bread. Beef tacos-well lets just say they did not taste like carne asada. There was no flavor of either a marinade or the charcoal grill it should have been cooked on. Tasted like it was just chopped up and cooked on a plain old plancha. The rice-it just tasted like rice cooked in a lot of Caldo de Pollo instant bouillon. The beans-they were actually ok. Maybe even homemade. Still had lumps of whole beans in them (a good thing.) The fresh salsa bar, nice and clean and fresh with a good variety of fresh veggies, limes, salsas. The only problem is that the marinated veggies had way too much allspice in them which overpowered the tanginess. I can't speak for the chicken tacos because I didn't taste them so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Would I drive all the way there again for their food? (30 minutes one way) No. I'd drive all the way to Mexico before I'd waste the time and money on this place."}
{"text":"I love the hole-in-the-wall feel of this place and they were friendly people, but I was not impressed by the food. I tried carnitas, lengua, and al pastor. All of these were really dry.  Something was a little off with the bitter-tasting guacasalsa. And the horchata was way too sweet.  On the plus side are the roasted jalepenos and spicy salsa bar. Maybe I 'd come back to try the weekend specials like birria or menudo."}
{"text":"Service and friendliness of the staff could use a little improvement....but the tacos are delicious  had carne asada, cabeza and lengua the 9 taco special for two people and we had leftovers. Definitely worth the drive. Highly recommend to authentic Mexican taco lovers!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here 17 years. Not nearly as often as we would like as some of us are in other states now. Amazing salsa, and I would kill for the recipe to their cauliflower pepper mix! I just drove over and hour round trip thru 3 different cities because my sister is visiting from Washington and it's a must have when anyone comes back to Arizona! Same friendly staff working since the first day I was lucky enough to find this hidden gem! Quick service and delicious food! My only complaint is that they're too far away! Sometimes the hole in the wall spots are the best kept secrets! But judging by their expansion and how busy it was on a Sunday afternoon.....it's not a secret anymore!"}
{"text":"Make sure you check your order before you leave, I didn't get correct what I ordered to go!"}
{"text":"Very real very authentic Mexican food.

The tacos are really good, the nachos were tasty and large portion.

The burritos come with beans and rice only and pico,so I would say to skip the carbs and go tacos loco get 3-5 as they are small but delicious."}
{"text":"At least once or twice a week I find myself finishing up at the gym after work around 9 PM with nothing planned for dinner -- this coincidentally is also the time when pretty much EVERYTHING besides fast food closes... but not Tacos Jalisco! For that reason alone I'll definitely be a returning customer, the authentic Mexican food just happens to be the icing on the cake (pretty sure they don't have cake, sorry bout it).

Sure, it looks a little sketchy outside, but in my experience that's how you know the food's gonna be good, especially in the case of Mexican restaurants. Inside, the seating area is much cleaner and well-lit. There are two menus: one in English directly above the counter, and one to your right in Spanish. A bit overwhelmed by all the possible combos, I decided to work my way through the menu numerically, starting, of course, at combo 1: burrito and taco with carne asada. As expected, most combos come with refried beans, rice, and a small salad. I have to say the asada in my burrito was a little soft, rather than the crispy, fried asada I prefer, but overall the experience was pretty good.

Definitely going to need to try a torta next!"}
{"text":"The new cashier is very rude. Absolutely no customer service skills at all. I don't drive out there to be talked to like I'm stupid for asking simple questions."}
{"text":"In the area from out of town looking for some good mexican food to takeaway.  As others have mentioned, it is a hole in the wall kind of place that is easy to miss but the food is decent.  I would say it's not \"drive across town good\" but a solidly good place if you're in the area.  I had the carne asada tacos (#6 on the menu) which were good, but I probably should have stopped by the salsa bar since they were a little dry.  We also ordered chips & guacamole - chips were good however the guacamole seemed thin and runny not chunky as I typically prefer."}
{"text":"I came here on the New Times recommendation while on a recent business trip, and ye gods it was absolutely worth it.

This may just have been the best Mexican food I've ever had.

I was kicking myself for only ordering a burrito/taco combo and not something more adventurous, but the chicken (burrito) and carnitas (taco) were the stuff my dreams are made of.

You are doing yourself a disservice by reading this review and not driving over there right now to order something. Do it."}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THE THREE TACO DISH. Mmmm... marinated pork.

Trust me, you do NOT want to pass this place up."}
{"text":"Got the three tacos plate. I can't believe they only charge $7 for this plate (shhhhh)
Amazing bargain for the quality of food. This is real mexican food, not that suburbanized food chain stuff.  Classic \"foodie\" joint..."}
{"text":"Hands Down the best Mexican food I have ever had in Arizona. You know the food is legit when you have to order in Spanish. The combination plates are a nice selection for indecisive eaters. I had a Torta al pastor with a taco de asada. The meat was deliciously seasoned and juicy, no where near dry. They also have a salsa bar with 3 types of salsa, as well as fried jalapenos and pickled items. Can't wait to return, I may have just found my new regular spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. This place is the real deal. Greeted by friendly staff and the three taco plate was outstanding."}
{"text":"walked in with high expectations. after tasting the salsa i was expecting delicious tacos. i had the carne asada tacos. no bueno. they tasted super bland. also ordered the torta ahogada. very spicy but no taste either. if i lived across the street i wouldn't go there to eat."}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood about a year ago from downtown Phoenix where we were surrounded by great Mexican food options. We didn't even know we have been walking distance from arguably one of the better ones here on this side of town. I had the chiles rellenos, my wife got the enchiladas, and it was all on point. The hot sauces/salsas etc were a surprising standout. Not the run of the mill flavors you would expect, you can tell they pay attention to detail. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Reminds me of King Taco in Los Angeles. Authentic food, authentic ambiance, friendly hard-working staff. Carne asada is top notch and roasted jalapenos from the salsa bar were fantastic"}
{"text":"I am an incredibly picky Mexican food eater, and after having lived in Scottsdale for two years, was disappointed nothing came near authentic...until I came here! I've been here three times in the last week already and have tried their tacos al pastor, chile rellenos, and chicken burittos. All were amazing (not to mention their awesome home-made flan and horchata!). I'm so glad I found somewhere decent and authentic!!

Side note: they only take cash! And its a really small venue so it can get crowded.

Edit: they now accept most major credit cards, and are expanding to the next door space! I love this place."}
{"text":"Ate here based on other Yelper's reviews. I was in town in Phoenix looking for some good, cheap Mexican food. The restaurant smells terrible. Like...rotting seafood on the pier, terrible. However, the food is pretty decent. I ordered a #7, which is 3 tacos (I chose carne asada) and the fixins. It was simply mediocre. Good beans and rice, but I found the flavor in the Carne Asada lacking. It's good bang for the buck, but I drove 20 minutes from my hotel based on Yelp's ratings, so I feel slightly disappointed. However, I really enjoyed the bar next door, the \"Closing Soon Saloon\" (which has been open for 26 years, ironically). 

Bottom line: Don't make a special trip, but if you're staying in the area, and want good bang for the buck, hit 'em up."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent value. I'm also spoiled by their salsa.

I like to cook for myself, but sometimes I'm too busy or tired or whatever. I can go here and get a meal that will absolutely satisfy me for right around $10. That easily beats pizza delivery price, for example. 

My favorites: 

Nachos
Torta Ahogada
Papas Lokas (carne asada fries)
Quesadilla combo

flan dessert

They also offer different meats so if you want carnitas or lengue tacos they have that, you can also get a goat combo/soup on weekends.

They've remodeled a few times and the place is looking nicer than ever."}
{"text":"Great service and good food!

Ordered the 3 taco plate, which is more than enough food for 1 person! It comes with rice and beans, lettuce and tomatoes salad, and an avocado side- not really like guacamole but avocado salsa? Also, chips and salsa. 

There's a salsa bar with 3 different salsas, with the green tomatillo one being the spicy one. The salsa bar also has pickled peppers. 

Plenty of meat selections for the tacos- including the authentic kinds, like tongue, tripe, pork skin, beef cheek. But it also has the regular meats, chicken, steak, marinated pork, etc. You can chose corn or flour tortilla. Tacos are topped with cilantro and onions. 

It was real tasty but kind of on the greasy side. Nevertheless, still good street tacos."}
{"text":"There ain't no great Mexican restaurants here in Scottsdale at all.  Too many chain restaurants here.  But a friend told me about this place so I gave it a try.  Man one the best places I've been to in Scottsdale.  I would recommend any one who live in Scottsdale to try out this place."}
{"text":"Best mex food!! The carne asada is the best"}
{"text":"I rely almost exclusively on Yelp reviews to help me sort through the seemingly endless supply of restaurants in the valley.  I would have never tried Tacos Jalisco without reading the previous reviews.  I'll keep this review short.  This restaurant has FANTASTIC FOOD at a GREAT PRICE.  It earns every one of the five stars.  I ate here once last week, and I am heading back today to try something different.  Based on the store facade, I would have never tried Tacos Jaliscos, but Yelp has taught me time and again to listen to the reviews and not to judge a book by its cover.  If you're looking for atmosphere, this is not your place.  If you're looking for incredibly tasty and authentic Mexican food at a great price, then this should be your next stop.  Oh, the green salsa is definitely the best."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken tacos and hands down the best tacos I've had in Phoenix. Definitely recommend this place if you want true authentic tacos."}
{"text":"People that follow my reviews might notice that I eat a lot of Mexican food. I'm also a Mexican food snob and this place is fantastic!!!!

I live down the street and when I saw this small place I knew I had to try it. It reminds me of Chicago - my home town. 

I love the tacos, especially the tongue tacos. I order #6 very often.

I tried their burrito once and I wasn't a big fan of it but I think that's just an Arizona thing. Burritos in this area are made in a different style than what I'm used to back home. My friends from Arizona love their burritos.

I highly recommend and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Not good at all!!  The meat is inedible... I really don't know how people like this place! Horrible horrible food!  Don't waste your money..  I'm so upset that I did!"}
{"text":"A very delicious whole in the wall taco shop... I found the place to be very clean and organized. I've ordered many different tacos and burritos her and loved them all!"}
{"text":"This place is for real. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food you have found the right place. Very reasonably priced and the salsa bar with radishes and peppers is a plus. I like the Carne Asada tacos the best! Don't be discouraged by the location because it will be worth your visit. The BOMB!"}
{"text":"There is a taco bell across the street.  I have no idea how a person could go there with this place right across the street.  Cheap and real Mexican!"}
{"text":"I've kind of stopped ordering other things from the menu after I discovered that their bean and cheese burritos with the reddish-brown salsa are among the very best things that life has to offer.  If I were to commit suicide, I'd lock myself in a room with hundreds of those burritos and a warped record playing somewhere softly.  Everyone would find me days later, dead as shit, with a big smile on my face."}
{"text":"Tacos Jalisco is not a fancy place and is a very casual - order at the counter, seat yourself, wait for your number kind of place. They serve mostly authentic style Jalisco Mexican Food. prices are unbelievably low and the food is Legit! I know as I've eaten tacos in Jalisco a number of times. They make everything in house - the tortillas, rice, beans and even all the vegetables and sauces on the salsa bar.

We shared a bunch of chicken and carne asada tacos ($1.51@) The tacos are double shelled (just like in Jalisco) and seemed double stuffed with lots of flavorful tender meat. They also garnished the plates with some chips that came in handy with the salsa bar.

We also shared a Chile Relleno Plate. They gave us not one but TWO Poblano peppers stuffed with mild melted white milky cheese. The peppers were lightly battered. This plate also included flavorful rice, creamy beans, avocado sauce, salad and tortillas.

We had a mountain of food, a beverage and it all cost only $22.71 with tax.

Great Value! 

Authentic Style Food that's very good!  


4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was authentic as it gets, served fast and hot!  Loved the \"real\" Coca Cola made with sugar in glass bottles from Tijuana!  Recommend the \"three tacos plate\" for around $7:  your choice of about 7-8 different kinds of meat, including beef tongue (you don't have to choose the tongue!)  Yummy, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Easily the most authentic Mexican food in the Phoenix area. Their carne Asada tacos makes you want to freeze time so the deliciousness can infiltrate your taste buds. They have a pretty stellar salsa bar. I love their dark red chipotle salsa. It's got heat paired with a nice smoked chipotle taste which makes the pain of the heat totally worth it. The only thing I would say is, I am a little skeptical of the cleanliness of the restaurant. The building itself is old and could use a good remodel to liven the place up a little. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place will always be home for me, their tacos and salsa formed the way I see Mexican food. I could literally drink their salsa. I didn't give 5 stars because I think the chips are over priced, the order is almost always wrong (so always check your order before leaving) and the guacamole could be legit guacamole. Other than that it's always clean and the ladies always try to bridge the language gap."}
{"text":"Love this authentic Mexican food restaurant. Tried it because of yelp reviews. All are true--plus, it's so clean. Not fancy, but who cares if the food is good!"}
{"text":"Made by Mexicans for Mexicans.  No Taco Bell, no hipster burritos with foie gras, no Teepee that caters to the gringo palette.  You will recognize most of the items but they haven't been bastardized on their trip north of the border. And yes they have the best tortillas in the area."}
{"text":"Wow just had one of the worst service experiences. Walked in today at 6:45 1/3/14 and immediately knew I should have turned around. There were two women working the front- both glared at us and made me extremely uncomfortable from the beginning. The one lady was standing near the cash wrap and literally glared and looked me up and down several times before ordering. The lady taking my order was worse- had a smirk on her face the entire time and the worst attitude. Got our food to go- doesn't stop there. I ordered 3 enchiladas that hardly had any sauce on them- very dry and smothered in sour cream. Not at all like the experience I had before but I will never return to this location and highly recommend you think twice. There are much better Mexican joints that treat you with respect. Awful experience!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Lots of traditional Mexican combo plates. I recommend the chicken taco & cheese quesadilla! I was never crazy about their beans and rice but they aren't bad. You can buy items a la cart also. I think a taco is only $1.50!
It's a hole in the wall place where you can dine in or get your food to go."}
{"text":"Driving by, I was like \"Hey, that place looks sketch AF\" so obviously their food must be MONEY.  Spoiler alert, it totally is, and their red salsas are probably the best salsas I've ever tasted. Knocking off one star for kind of a weird soap smell every time I walk in there which to me is really unappetizing - I don't think I'd be able to eat inside the restaurant, and one other issue - gristle bites. Every now and again I'll be biting into my delicious carne asada burrito and sink my teeth into a HUNK of gristle. Now I don't eat tripe or chicheronis or anything so this may fall into the category of 'white girl picky', but biting into a chewy, disgusting gristle bite really ruins it for me. I've unfortunately come across 1-2 gristleritos on my burrito escapades there and have promptly thrown the remaining burrito in the garbage gagging. I will say that if you detect a gristle bite early and can spit it out before it hits your molars, you can go on your merry burrito eating way. Gristle or not, Tacos Jalisco is HANDS DOWN the best hangover lifesaver in the entire world. Filibertos is for children. You want to reclaim your dignity like a champion, it's Tacos Jalisco all the way."}
{"text":"This place won best neighborhood Mexican restaurant from the New Times for a reason.  Great food for cheap prices.  Carne asada Tacos are perfect, and double-tortillad as they should be.

Awesome salsa bar, some of the better salsa I have had, and am a self professed expert, heh.  Highly recommend the Mexican shrimp cocktail as well.  My wife's boss, whose family is from Mexico, states that the breakfast burrito is to dir for.

They are in the middle of an expansion which will add much needed seating.  I just wish they would stay open after midnight."}
{"text":"Damn! If these aren't some of the best street tacos around I don't know where you could go... The tacos are great the salsas are awesome and the service is terrific! If you like pickled vegetables and all the jalapeños and carrots and that kind of stuff they are these's plenty of that, and if you like fresh radishes, plenty of limes and the salsa bar is just wonderful.
I've only had the Carnitas and the carne Asada so far but both of them are wonderful. Next time maybe I will have the Al pastor or chorizo.
And price it can't be beat. Tacos are $1.62 apiece, so for tacos loaded with meat and onions and cilantro on doubled corn tortillas plus soda is eight bucks total what a deal"}
{"text":"The homemade tortillas alone deserve four solid stars. This is a dive. I repeat, a dive. It's teeny tiny and it's only because of Yelp that we even knew it existed and then decided to actually walk inside. It was Cinco de Mayo and we felt the need to enjoy some authentic Mexican cuisine. We turned to the trustee Yelp mobile app, Tacos Jalisco popped up so we thought, \"why not!? Yelpers approve, so it must be good.\" We pull up to this divey little hole in the wall Mexican food shop off a residential street. We walk inside and they have pictures of food on the walls with numbers next to each one. I decided to order the #10 which was a quesadilla and a taco and my husband ordered the #7 which was the Carne Asada. I definitely won in the ordering department and that typically never happens. 

My quesadilla was pretty tasty and the accompanying taco was small enough to provide a taste without filling me up too much. However, the thing that stands out the most is their tortillas. They are homemade, authentically Mexican tortillas. Large and in charge tortillas. Buttery and soft tortillas. The #7 Carne Asada comes with a whole lot of meat and then a large tortilla. The meat is tasty but it could have used some cheese so it might be worth it to ask for cheese to be added. The quesadilla was just as a quesadilla should be, cheesy and yummy. 

I would say that this place is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for some cheap, good Mexican food. It would be great if you are recovering from one to many drinks, or you're in the midst of having one too many drinks. It's also good on just a fatty day!"}
{"text":"My husband was looking for Milanesas. So, we came to this place since they were the only place in Scottsdale that I could find that had any on their menu.

My husband ordered Milanesas, with rice and beans.  I ordered a burrito and taco combo with carnitas.  The Milanesas were not cooked to order.  They were dry and brittle looking.  The meat was paper thin.  The beans were like Taco Bell beans; they were of a watery substance.  Their carnitas were boiled and tasteless.  My burrito had nothing BUT carnitas in it.  Who does that?!!They serve their combo meals with a side of lettuce and tomatoes with a dollop of mayonnaise.  Pretty strange if you ask me.  The only thing I enjoyed was the horchata.  Thaaaat's about it.  

After going to a few places in Scottsdale, looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food, I have officially given up.  The only reason I gave two stars is because the horchata was really good.  Other than that, the place is a hole in the wall FULL of flies."}
{"text":"Another visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale, and two return visits to this amazing little hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.
I am a carne asada taco aficionado and this place has the best tacos I have ever had.  (Maybe a few places in San Diego have come close).
Just get anything with their red salsa and you won't be disappointed.  Everything I have ever had here has a special homemade taste, from the pinto beans to the tacos."}
{"text":"Carne aside quesadilla is so good and the horchata is perfect. Not too sweet or cinnamon-y. Lots of parking too."}
{"text":"Great tacos and salsa.  Carnitas, pescado, and goat...and good salsa and roasted jalapeños."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and we love it! Both of us are very picky about our tacos and I love carne asada in a dangerous way, this place is amazing! The meat has wonderful texture and flavor!! The guys here definitrly know how to work the grill. I want to try something different but I just love the carne too much! Maybe someday lol."}
{"text":"I love good authentic Mexican fare. The problem: most Mexican joints adapt their offerings to satisfy local tastes and expectations. 
This place offers up delicious Mexican food which is cooked to please the local Hispanic community. I say that because the majority of the clientele here is Hispanic. As is the kitchen staff. 
I tried their Combination # 3, a platter full of goodness: a torta and 2 tacos chock full of delicious beef tongue. Of course, it came with rice, guacamole, beans and a small salad. All I can say is this was seriously good cooking. 
The eating area is smashing but clean and service is friendly. 
This one is definitely for the books"}
{"text":"Okay, so we came here with high hopes. I mean we ate the whole damn thing... but seriously eating here I was worried we would be worshiping the porcelain throne all night. I can't share the throne... the flavors were just off and tasted old.              
 
 If you're looking for below mediocre tacos, come on down.  Also, got bottled Mexican Coke... it was gross. There's a stamp that says, \"Cola flavored beverage\" on it and they were rebottled. I'm all for recycling, but it's gross. Sorry friends."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and their homemade salsa is the best. The burritos are fantastic too."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the parking lot and appearance! Tacos Jalisco is delicious, authentic Mexican food. It's clean inside and the staff is nice. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla and carne asada taco combo. It came with a side of beans and a tiny salad. It was cooked to order - you can see into the kitchen so you know it's fresh. They have a salsa bar with limes, grilled peppers, and three or four types of homemade salsa.

I was very hungry when I ordered and the combo meal was just large enough to leave me stuffed! Anything extra would have been too much food. :) 

I ordered a horchata and it was delicious! The vanilla and cinnamon flavors blended smoothly. I love horchata so I'm happy it was great! I plan to will get horchata every time I go!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food.  I never would have found this place without Yelp.  My carne asada combo plate was delicious.  It's in a kinda sketchy strip mall but that makes it even more fun to visit."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place. It's bigger inside than it looks from the outside, because it's located in a tiny strip mall with a Circle K and a tiny tavern.

This is the only what one would consider authentic Mexican restaurant that I've found that actually puts rice AND beans in their delicious burritos automatically. Their breakfast burritos are outstanding. Parking is a little tight, as this joint is popular!"}
{"text":"One our favorite spots!! It's always the whole in the wall places that are the best!!! It's authentic and it reasonably priced. My usual is tortas with carne asada and a big cup of horchata. Yummm!! Also the staff is really nice. Always happy to support a local business. 
Bonus it's a hop skip and a jump from our apartment!"}
{"text":"If you're into authentic Mexican food this is the place for you! You're taste buds will have a party when they grab a sample of their unique flavor. All their food tastes AMAZING. Bold marinated carne asada, lemony fresh cevice, spicy yummy menudo, I have NO COMPLAINTS regarding their food it is WONDERFUL. The only downside is this place is tiny and the location is a bit on the bad side. The employees aren't rude but theyre not super friendly either. Regardless, I believe the food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"Food was good except the guacamole. Way too salty. It's like they forgot whether or not they put salt in it so added more then forgot again and came back and added more lol. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Maybe we went on a bad day, but we've tasted better. Plus, the place kind of smelled icky--perhaps because it was a hot day and the bathrooms don't really have good ventilation. Eww.
We're originally from California, and my husband lived in Guadalajara when he was a whippersnapper, so we aren't strangers to Mexican food. We wanted to like this place, we really did. We moved to Scottsdale for my husband's job and we're on the hunt for some good Mexican food. We want to find both a  \"hole-in-the-wall\" place and a good restaurant (where we can take family and out of town guests) that have flavorful food. We had high hopes for this one based on ratings and reviews, but for the life of us we can't understand why there were so many good reviews. Hungry college students, perhaps? I don't know. 
Our search continues."}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive street tacos. The breakfast burritos are killer, and the camarones rancheros never disappoint."}
{"text":"Waiting for my 5 tacos.....got Asada, pastor, cabeza, tripa and chicharron ooooh n a Fresca .....waiting patiently.
Place is nice.....service is great.....except for the young cook yelling at the aawsome cashier.
Anyways food is ready n im about to dig in!!!

First is the Pastor.....great taste just like the ones I member from TJ when I was a kid.

Next is the asada....Wow not dry like other places I have tried....nice n tender....very good

Next is the cabeza.....hmmmmmm.....great taste....nice n juicy....love the cabeza.

Next is the Chicharron....Oh my the chicharron is the kind that has meat on.....lordy lord!!! Yummy!!!!

Last but not least is Tripa....My my my....they r cooked to perfection....not to crisp n not to soft just right!!

Overall this place rocks....u cant find a good place that makes authentic street tacos....just cant find that many good ones in AZ. But here is one.... will be back to try some other meat tacos...

Esta Delicioso!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the better authentic Mexican food I've had since moving to Phoenix.  It doesn't compare to some of the amazing Mexican I've had in Tucson, but for Scottsdale, it was pretty good.  It's a dive, 100% a dive, but the best Mexican places are.  The carne asada was good as well as the tortillas.  They had horchata, which was also very good, if a little on the sweet side.  My friend had the chicken, which received rave reviews.  I will be back when I'm craving some good authentic non-frou frou Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and quick. Service was friendly and prompt. Bathroom was not really cleanest and restaurant doesn't offer alcohol. Good place to grab a quick bite after hiking camelback."}
{"text":"Great authentic food!  No frills... Just good Mexican food!  Tacos and burrito were great. I also love the chicken tostada because the chicken is so well seasoned. I didn't try the ceviche but it looks great and it is made Jalisco style which I like.  The only bummer is they don't serve alcohol.  A cold beer with this food would be great! It is a small place in a little tiny strip mall.  Easy to pass by but look for the Circle K. 
Nice people and service as well."}
{"text":"Great taco shop. The Carne Asada and Chicken Fajitas are their strongest. The green salsa is incredible, as well as the spicy pickled carrots and jalapeños. 

Atmosphere is what you'd expect from a traditional taco shop, not good for date night but my lady and I enjoy coming here in our comfy clothes. 

Parking is easy right out front."}
{"text":"I live next door and I love this place. It's very clean and has the freshest food. Their carne asada tacos are to die for. I may be a Gringa but I am picky with Mexican food. Recommend to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall - YES
Great food - YES
Like many hole in the wall places, people must get past the location and language barrier. If you can't get past that,go to taco bell and shut it. Is it perfect, no. Is the food good with great portions for the lrices, heck yes! If you're unsure of what to order, stay with go-to plates, Carne Adada tacos or Pork Flautas aka Taquitos are pretty tasty! I had the gordita combo. What I enjoyed was that  they arrived it so the corn breading wouldn't get soggy! Huge plus! Give this a shot - it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped here one Sunday night after a little walk around Old Town. I came looking just for tacos. I got tacos. They were legit. Chips and salsa were decent."}
{"text":"The best, authentic, delicious, and so cheap. Their lengua tacos are worth driving for plus there's tapatio hot sauce stocked on each table. Nom."}
{"text":"A great place to find street tacos @ very reasonable price! The pastor tacos were on point!  And the roasted jalapeños on the salsa bar added the perfect touch of heat to the tacos."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic Mexican food. I return here whenever I'm visiting Scottsdale because it's just that good.  This place is top 5 all time on my personal list of taco joints. 

Obligatory hole in the wall comment... 
I haven't had issues with service like some other reviewers, but I agree that it's nothing special. Everyone was friendly enough and I think a certain \"gruff\" comes with the territory. It's a small place that caters to locals (i.e. workers on lunch break and Mexican American families), not tourists or retirees. So I think for me that negates any concerns with location and service as expressed by others. 

In any event,  the food is what stands out here. When you first walk in there is a bar with various pickled veggies and salsas. Try the radishes! The menu is long enough to satisfy varied preferences but not so long as to overwhelm. I've had most things and everything is great! As mentioned,  carne asada is good, but I think you can do better. The tripa is great, lengua is good (crispy exterior, melt in your mouth interior), and the sweet pork is outstanding. Rice and beans are solid and the crema and Mexican mayo taste sooo homemade. I like salsa verde quite a bit and probably use it \"improperly,\" but it's great on everything.

If you are the kind of person who looks beyond the surface and appreciates really good Mexican food, do yourself a favor and check this place out.
NOW!"}
{"text":"Not good in the least bit. Everything generally flavorless. No distinct flavors as everything just muddled together. Escabeche was bland - not sure how that was accomplished."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden GEM!!! 
They have endless options from burritos- tacos- quesadillas(huge)- to yummy ceviche- shrimp tostadas you name it!!! 
The combos come with rice and beans and lettuce- it's a lot of food. I tend to have eyes larger than my stomach. 
Oh have I mentioned their salsa bar  green salsa to pics to spicy red heaven salsa! They also have grilled jalapeños- pickled carrots and onions and cucumber/radishes all at your disposal. 
Such good food and fast service!! If you are looking for bomb Mexican food - go here!!!"}
{"text":"I liked but I didn't love. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't as amazing as expected. I felt the beans were a bit watery and the rice dry. I do understand that we are dealing with take-out Mexican food here but with their prices being a bit over the local average, I was hoping for better quality or serving sizes. I guess at the end of the day, there was nothing wrong but there was also nothing pulling me back to visit again and again."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Love the chicken and carne asada tacos. The ceviche tostada is super tangy and I like it like that. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't have the kind of sour cream I like LOL this is legit Mexican food with nice women running the front area like champs. The salsa bar rocks especially if you like super spicy ones! Be aware it can get really busy during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Authentic, affordable, friendly taco spot.  Highly recommend.  Get several plates and share."}
{"text":"great place with great people. the cashier was extra helpful while helping us decide what to order. the food is great and the atmosphere is very peaceful, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is in a really sketchy-looking building next to an even sketchier-looking laundromat, but the restaurant itself was surprisingly decent inside. The food was good and service was quick. We tried a variety of dishes, but thought the Al pastor tacos were the best. Beans and rice were \"meh\" and the guacamole was neon so I didn't try it. The salsas were amazing and the best part of the meal. Next time we'll just have the Al pastor tacos and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"The wife and I visited our daughter at GCU.  We've eaten at a few Mexican restaurants, but this place was great.  Clean, and my carne asada was fat free and great.  Only the second time in my 52 years of life that I've rated a restaurant.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Absolutely best fast food Mexican. This place ruined any burto's type place for me. They make their burritos abbot different beans in carne asada burro for example but it's better in my opinion!  Their salsa is insane good! Place is no joke and def worth a try. I like the green and chunky red. .... you're welcome in advance"}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 taco combo. Was allowed to mix and match the meat. The beef and chicken were well cooked. The soft taco was ok. The rice and beans were good too. Salsa was spicy the way I like it. Really a good restaurant for the price."}
{"text":"I think I just found my new favorite Mexican joint. Like other Yelpers say, this place isn't much to look at on the outside but they are cooking up some awesome food inside.

I ordered the #10 which is a carne asada taco, a quesadilla, rice and beans. I went for the taco first. Their tacos are small but mighty. The meat was tender and the salsa had a kick but was no overpowering - very flavorful. Next was the quesadilla. Granted, it's hard to mess up melted cheese in a tortilla but definitely hit the mark if ooey gooey cheese is your thing.

I thought the rice and beans were really good too. Dipping the quesadilla in the beans made it that much more awesome. 

The staff was very friendly - they greeted us right away when we came in and thanked us on our way out. 

I'm very much looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other kinds of tacos - chicken, al pastor, carnitas - yum!!"}
{"text":"For  \"Fast\" Mexican food, this place kills it. I LOVE the carne asada burrito. It is excellent!  The salsa cart is always clean and has many options. Can't beat the prices either. If you're looking for a fast, quick, meal give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food in a hole in the wall place!!  Don't let the atmosphere deter you.  We are from SLC, Utah and found this place on Yelp. It had four tables, so is small, but well worth it.  They had a Mexican telenovela (soap opera) on TV while we were there but it was quiet.  We had tacos and huevos rancheros with beans and rice; all of the food including salsas were great.  To drink we had the Mexican apple soda, so tasty!  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch based on yelp reviews, I was craving shrimp cocktail. I'm pregnant and what the baby wants the baby gets. When I first pulled up, I was like... oh... uh.... I contemplated going somewhere else because it definitely looks sketchy from the outside. But I decided to trust the yelpers and I went in, and my whole mindset completely changed. It's small, but it's totally clean, organized, and nice inside! A lot of places to sit and it was all just very clean. I was surprised. The lady who took my order was nice, didn't speak too much English but enough to get my order right which is all I cared about. 

While I waited for my food I got some of their hot carrots/jalapenos and was happy to find there was also hot cauliflower in there, which I love (the baby loves). My food came out in a few minutes and I took it back to work to eat. My shrimp cocktail was really good. Just what you'd expect, nothing super fancy but the shrimp was very big and they were not stingy. I only ordered the medium, at first I wished I got the large but while I was eating I kept finding more and more big shrimp in the cup and it was definitely satisfying enough for lunch. Also they were generous with the avocado too, which always makes me happy. 

I ate my hot carrots and cauliflower by themselves after and it may sound silly but they were soo good. They were really spicy and tangy all the way through, but not mushy or overly hard with no flavor like some places. It was so good I wish I had gotten more!

5 stars, even though it's a little shady on the outside, I can't knock them for that. I will definitely be back again soon for the carne asada everyone is talking about!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I had never stopped in to eat here before.  I live down the street and drive by here daily.  This is the closest to authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten in the US.  The street tacos are only $1.51 and super tasty.  The real star is the ceviche.  It is fresh and the shrimp is cooked in the lime juice and not chewy like most Tex Mex places.  It is also very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Mexican food in Scottsdale! I recently took my Venezuelan girlfriend here and she was completely blown away by how good the food was!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. The refried beans and rice were standouts."}
{"text":"Two words: carne Asada. This place has the most delicious and cheap food ever. You get so much food with every meal, and it is all amazing. The carne Asada is by far my favorite thing that I've tried. I've heard everything else is good too I just can't bring myself to order anything else. Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. All their burritos are filled with grease and their meat is always uncooked! Tortillas are always cold as well. For the price, there's tons of other mexican places way better than This!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a hole in the wall gets recognition on yelp...well, just for being a hole in the wall. I can't stand it when people give anything over 3 stars to a place like that. Their Yelp accounts should be banned and writing privileges revoked. So let's sum this up dish by dish.

Beans and rice have the flavor of a pesticide. Not just any pesticide, but the kind used to kill only the fiercest of roaches. I have never had beans nor rice that taste this bad. The flavor is not comparable to anything, but the emotion is only comparable to that of returning to Taco Bell after not eating there for a decade. If you haven't experienced that feeling, I hope you never do. Consider yourself a very lucky person.

The camarones rancheros were mixed with french fries. Who thought to mix shrimp with french fries? And after disgusting inventions like that, people here comment that this is \"authentic\" Mexican food? Either they've been eating from a garbage can in Tijuana (in which case, they aren't lying about authenticity, but what else have you tried mixing shrimp with? A syringe?) or they simple don't care. The only decent thing here was the lengua tacos. Simple, no frills, decent lengua. For desert, tried the tres leches. It's a relatively simple dessert that I didn't think would be easy to mess up, but it was \"the worst\" (grumpy cat voice). Barely moist, tasted like a synthetic mix cake from Walmart. Just horrible.

To my surprise and to highlight a positive in this ruined dinner, they do take American Express. Most joints like this don't. However, that ended up as a double edge sword since otherwise I may not have come here. Stay clear unless this is the only thing open, then get Lengua tacos."}
{"text":"I only ate one dish. The carne asada . It was delicious! Their fresh jalapeño and pickled vegetables were fantastic. The food was very flavorful and very reasonable . 
Must try if you are bored to tears with the Americanized versions of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Thank you for the delicious burrito. The salsa is really good too  I will be back for sure probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had.  Corn, flour, beef cheek, beef tongue, carne asada, pork, everything.  Don't be afraid to step into this hole in the wall.  I'd drive from Tucson just for these tacos."}
{"text":"i'm neither nexican nor an expert on mexican food ... but this was tasty!  nearly as authentic as i could imagine.

disclaimer:  i didn't enter the restaurant; i only ate food carried out from the restaurant.

+1 for fantastic tacos, both beef and chicken.  our family ordered 15 of them for dinner.

+1 for great beans.  i've found this to be a great measure of a mexican restaurant.

+0 for unsalted chips

+1 for great prices.

recommended."}
{"text":"I can't believe I found a place that Phoenicians I have not reviewed yet. This place really is an amazing little taco restaurant, or should I say Mexican restaurant as it has burritos, tacos, and the like. This is Mexican, very Mexican as they had my favorite tacos la langua. Yes, it's cows tongue, I know it sounds gross but it's pretty good. It's more tasty than regular beef. I'll bet their tacos eL Pastore would be amazing.

The staff is friendly and the place is clean, I don't know how long it's been open but I always seem traffic going in and out of there and decided to give it a try. It seems to be inhabited by the local laborers and workmen and probably locals in the area but I really really enjoyed it.

They have a vegetable Bar on the side that I completely missed where I could a got jalapeños, radishes extra salsa, but really no need is the tacos I had were perfect and the green salsa that was on it was great. The avocados were excellent. And for 10 bucks for three tacos and a large Coke it was a great deal.

Sadly I'm leaving the Scottsdale area but this is definitely a place that I would haunt."}
{"text":"I visited Tacos Jalisco the other day and was reminded of my old spots back in LA. I know good lick your plate clean Mexican food, so I have high standards. This place is definitely a hole in the wall joint and I actually passed it. You pretty much need to look for the Circle K and it shares the same lot. I was impressed that they had some of the \"unusual\" meat options like beef head meat and beef tongue (my faves). I came in hungry and ordered three tacos (two lengua/ one cabeza) and a bean & cheese burrito. I thought the meat kinda lacked salt, but the salsa from the salsa bar improved that. I enjoyed that the salsa bar had pickled carrots, califlower, jalapeno mix. Other then that the salsa was ok. The bean & cheese burrito was substantial. I actually could only eat half of it, which was challenging cus it was gud. I will be back to try more items and hope to improve my rating."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and yes!  Their salsa bar is worth the trip alone however this place is legit!  You get so much amazing tasting food for such little money.  Easily addictive!"}
{"text":"Pretty good inexpensive place. The tacos were good and had enough meat. My only complaint would be the green salsa it had a lot of allspice in it."}
{"text":"I wish we had this place in Colorado. The Carne Asada tacos and burrito are awesome. My favorite part is the salsa bar- green salsa, roasted jalapeños, jalapeño mix with carrots abd cauliflower. And radish to cool your mouth. :) this will be one of my first stops in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really good street tacos....the carne is the best...pork was just ok. Fast and friendly service. The salsa??!!!! Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch. It's a hole in a small plaza shared with a convenience store and some dive bar. But man, it's legit. Nice and clean place with cooks that are clean and the woman behind the register was very nice. The food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing! Just like sitting in Downtown Ensenada Baja California! A Hidden Gem for sure... Authentic and Super Fresh! I will be back again and again, and I live 35 miles away!"}
{"text":"Donny be fooled or turned off by the location of this place. This place seriously has the best tacos in town! Tastes really authentic and its very reasonably priced. Sometimes there's a line out the door."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to live a block away from Scottsdale's Best Mexican food! I eat here quite often (1-3 times/month)... So I consider myself a TJ's pro! 

First of all- The Salsa Bar
Two thumbs up! The SALSA VERDE IS THE BEST ever, and you can take as much home as you want! The Salsa Bar also has fresh cut limes and radishes, as well as a SPICY RED SALSA and various other toppings. 

2nd- Main Course 
I love tacos- who doesn't? 
The carne is seasoned perfectly, and served on double stacked corn tortillas- topped with fresh chopped onion and cilantro. This is my personal favorite way to eat carne asada.

I have also tried the al pastor, spicy shrimp, and chicken tacos- all of them were also delicious. 

Oh! THE ROLLED TACOS 
Try them!! 
(I order them w/o tomatoes...) They come loaded with guac and sour cream, rice and beans.

3rd- RICE & BEANS 
YUM! Try these. Just because you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, cheap tacos. If your looking for a taco fix then this place will definitely satisfy your cravings. I have had better but this place is definitely in top 10. One of the best salsas I've had in a while. Carne could use a little more something but, I can see this place being pack after a night out on the town"}
{"text":"REVIEW BASED ON HORCHATA ONLY.

All I had was the horchata, but boy was it magnificient! We almost ate there...and then I saw the guy in the back cutting up the meat, and I was like, \"nah....\"

I'm sure it's great though!"}
{"text":"Love me some Tacos Jalisco! If you're looking for authentic Mexican food at a great price this is your spot. Highly recommend if you want something different than the \"normal\" burrito joint around Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you read a bad review, especially about the one across the street from a Taco, you are talking & reading about the wrong place.  This Tacos Jalisco (the real one) is on 68th Street, not on Thomas.  The location on Thomas is their original location which they sold, and in the contract had to allow them the right to use the name.  The food is not even close!! So make sure you check out the correct location on 68th.  You will be happy that you did.  The \"free\" pickled veggie bar is awesome, be sure to grab some of it in a baggie on your way it to accompany your meal. Another great one is the pace across the street next door to TD Road house.  Their Carne Asada is unreal, or the chicken that they grill outside over coal.  a Whole chicken, pint of rice, pint of beans, pint of home made salsa, like 10-12 corn tortillas, $10!"}
{"text":"Wow. I love tacos and this brought real Jalisco style tacos to Scottsdale. Unreal! Grilled Jalepenos too."}
{"text":"Philip is right! This place is legit... the other one off of Thomas has really gone downhill"}
{"text":"Honesty my favorite Mexican food in Arizona. It's super super authentic!! The salsa is amazing and everything I've tried has been great. The guacamole is watery and not great, that's the only thing I haven't liked. We loooove this place. Just try out. You will definitely not regret it!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. Get the al pastor tacos. They marinate the meat so well. This is my favorite place. Wouldn't want to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a great quick \"hole in the wall\" you found it. Delicious quick service authentic Mexican food. Super affordable delicious flavors and great portion sizes. It's our go to for take out but they also have a small dinning area. We've been several times and have enjoyed lots of different items. So glad it's just around the corner!"}
{"text":"These are the best and most authentic tacos in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, almost as good as Mi Casita in Chandler. Prices are really good too."}
{"text":"I was disappointed!! MX food is my favorite, but do not plan to go back to this place.  The best thing I can say was the shredded beef was tender..... guacamole or what ever it was supposed to be was very thin (watered down??).  The salsa bar didn't look appetizing."}
{"text":"This place is so good the tacos to the burritos even down to the salsa.... I've been coming here for 15 years ... I'll drive quite a distance to eat a burrito and have some horchata :) ...  i definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Tried a sope for the very first time here and wasn't disappointed. The taco was good but not the best I've ever had. But I'm a self proclaimed taco snob. Jaimaica was definitely tasty too.

Overall, this place is great to stop by if you're partying in Old Town and have the drunchies for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"I came to this place ready to eat some good food. Seeing all the yelp reviews I was excited. Everything went down hill when I started seeing COCKROACHES. The food and asada was moist and good like everyone has stated. 
There was a couple of girls that came in and were screaming from them crawling on their feet. The young ladies that were behind the counter just laughed and continued to take orders. 
I cant comment on the food to much because I didnt get to finish my food, I ended up leaving after seeing cockroaches everywhere. The fact that they werent doing anything about the infestation and just laughed about it made my stomach turn. They thought it was also funny that we had left because of it and just sent one lady to sweep the cockroaches off the walls and floors and throw them outside.. 
Never again.."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Dont bother! This is not authentic this is just not good.dont eat here."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem has the best carne asada taco plate!! The salsa is always fresh and the flour tortillas are amazing. It's always packed here but food comes out quickly! It is definitely the best authentic place in Old Town."}
{"text":"Everything is $8:35  All though the food was good, tacos were pretty small  If only they had a bigger menu"}
{"text":"I just ordered four tacos ate them in like two minutes then ordered two more. Authentic Mexican food at an extremely affordable price."}
{"text":"Came across this place thanks to Yelp and it did not disappoint!  We just got takeout -- carne asada -- to take back to the place where we were staying, but the food was great and I second Katie K's comment that the salsa verde there is incredible!  I literally ate it with a spoon."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall but it was open late so here I went!
After staring at all the options at the wall I finally went with the huevos rancheros. 

Pros
+Portions
+$5 
+Salsa Bar

Wow I finished this five dollar box of goodness but just barely. It came with beans, rice, veggies, egg, pico, and tortillas on the side. If your hungry and in the area a combo from Tacos Jaliscos is way better then shelling out for the 5 buck box at T-Bell's.

IT DOES THE JOB
*It really does look like your run of the mill Filiberto's combo but taste's better somehow"}
{"text":"I was out for some spring training and was tired of hot dogs and burgers after a hangover tried the menudo on one day and and had the shrimp cocktail on another and it was great . Great variety of mexican food so if tired of the ballpark food and wants some good authentic mexican food  come here"}
{"text":"Bomb ass top notch taco joint...I'll never go to filibertos or any of those other spots when I'm home again."}
{"text":"I fought back and forth between a 5 and a 4. To be honest, the only reason I didnt give a 5 is because its my first time and I leave 5s for consistency. Taste though? Yeah, thats a 5. Carne asada burrito is bursting with flavor. I added cheese, only flaw with the burrito is that cheese wasnt fully melted. Other than that, delicious. Throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds, its fine. But the meat is definitely juicy compared to a lot of places in this area. I'll be back again, fairly soon. Only spent 8 bucks and thats cause I wanted a mexican coke(half liter) for 2 bucks. Thats pretty cheap in my book."}
{"text":"I judge a Mexican food restaurant by how they make chiles rellenos. The ones you can get here are awesome!  Their carne asada tacos a great too. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall... but sometimes the hole in the walls out there have the best food.
I searched this place out based on Yelp reviews, and it lived up to the reputation.  Awesome Carne Asada.  I had a taco plate and it was probably some of best Carne Asada I have had. Marinaded awesomely. Salsas were also fresh and fantastic.  Nothing fancy, but great authentic Mexican food from a slightly run down place.  Seems like that's always the way.  Next time in Scottsdale, I will return."}
{"text":"Very good street tacos. I did chicken and steak. The salsa was also good. The place is not fancy but the street tacos are worth coming for."}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada and egg burrito. Too often the carne is dry and too salty not at Tacos Jalisco. Savory adobo salsa, salsa verde, and homemade mild salsa available to kick it up. This place is a must when in the area, has been around awhile and has always been consistently good for breakfast or lunch stop. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best carne asada burrito I've ever had in my life. My wife is mexican, I know Mexican. Place is out of bounds."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem.   So authentic, so good, and prices less than Taco Bell crap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots! Totally authentic, delicious and affordable. Try the flan. When they ask which one, go for both. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Barely any vegan options and very little help in determining what possibilities might work. I did not stay here and if you eat vegan like I do, I would suggest you pass on this place, just like I did."}
{"text":"For a hole-in-the-wall taco shop, the #6 combo of 3 carne asada tacos with rice and beans was decent. Previous reviewers are correct in that the salsas are all absolutely delicious, especially the verde. The carne in the tacos is not very good quality, and tasted about a half step up from ground beef to me. I think why people like it is because it was very fatty meat. The beans were awful-- very little taste at all and soupy consistency. The rice was just as bad. I drowned both these sides in salsa just to make them edible. Great that you can enjoy with a Mexican Coke (no beer though). Parking's a bitch but made up for it with the ability to dine watching telenovelas."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexi dishes that are well priced and not skimpy on the serving sizes. They had my continued patronage when I saw the self-serve salsa, spicy carrots, radish, lime, and grilled jalapeño bar. 
The location is a bit sketchy but the food was absolutely worth the adventure"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! If you want real Mexican food. This is place for you! Beware though, they call out orders in Spanish and even certain parts of the menu are in Spanish. All of the combination meals are
Excellent, and unbelievably well priced! My wife and I come here every week because it's that good! Tacos Jalisco is a must!"}
{"text":"Muchas gracias, Yelpers!  We were looking for Mexican food near Scottsdale Stadium, and the Yelp reviews sent us to Tacos Jalisco.  I had the carne asada plate, which was seriously excellent.  I was really quite pleased with myself for ordering it, until the 2 guys I was with started raving about how good the carnitas were.  (They each had a carnitas / carne asada combo, and while they liked the carne asada, they were over the moon for the carnitas.)

Anyway... seriously good eats here.  But now I'm left with a lingering sense of carnita deprivation.  If I head out to AZ for spring training again, Tacos Jalisco is getting a re-visit."}
{"text":"Of all the taco spots I've been to in Phoenix, Tempe, and Scottsdale, this is by far my favorite one. They have the BEST carne asada tacos. Fuego!!"}
{"text":"Just great. Don't be fooled by the outside. Inside had plenty of tables. Clean. Fresh. 
Salsa and pickled veggies... Free! Lots of locals...Would not have found without Yelp!"}
{"text":"Place was solid. Food was hot, authentic and delicious. I read some complaints about the girl at the front. Look people, it is ok to go in, Order and eat. Sometimes a place has to offer hot, delicious, Authentic cuisine. AND THATS IT. Get off your high horse. Learn to appreciate what a place has to offer and not the amount of fake convo they want to have with you. Point at the menu item you want, and go talk with the people you came with. Not every place is a flying J truck stop with mandatory over the top friendly fake questions and concern."}
{"text":"Found this place on here and it didn't disappoint! The food was great and the condiments were HOT! Yelp was a life saver! Thanks for the tip!"}
{"text":"I ordered the burrito and taco plate w/chicken.  Taco was small but delicious.  Veggies in and with the burrito were fresh and crunchy.  I tried two of the three sauces and both were excellent.  I'll definitely return for more."}
{"text":"First of all, you could almost miss this tiny gem, in a small strip mall that includes a laundromat and a Circle K. But my husband did some \"best taco,\" researching and we ended up here.
The price of $1.51 per taco, certainly makes a trip completely risk free!
I ordered 3 chicken tacos, chips & guac, and horchata.
Hubby ordered chili rieonos & a big bottle of Fanta.
The tacos are spicy! Beware gringos! But for my taste it was perfect! I love a little spice & they were full of flavor with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro inside.

Best described as street tacos, I loved them!!! Will be back to try steak!

The guac is more of a runny green sauce, something I have seen at Mexican grocers as opposed to chunky pure guac.

My husband thoroughly enjoyed the chili rejonos (can't spell that word!)
His nose was running from the spicy (total gringo )

The atmosphere was clean and cafe style. Order at the counter and they call your number. There was a line the whole time we were there for Sunday evening at 6pm, they seem to be a busy spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hole in the wall type place 
Shrimp cocktail was on point
Fast service 
Probably won't be back cause I'm coming from out of town but good spot if you're a local ."}
{"text":"We come here probably 2x a week, usually for my late night cravings...the best Mexican food I've had in az (im from California) I can't believe we just discovered  this place last year ...we've been missing out! Everything we've tried has been great,  they don't have Chile verde pork so i go with Carne asada and this is the best I've had"}
{"text":"Place is GOOD! Was recommended by a co-worker to go here and it was a good suggestion. The tacos are really inexpensive and they load it up with meat! Which is really tasty and melts in your mouth. It gets busy here so don't chance it if you're in a time crunch because this place isn't huge so you have to give them time to prepare your food."}
{"text":"Like other Yelpers, I found out about this hole-in-the-wall via another Yelper.  I have had it bookmarked for a while!  I haven't gone before today because they only accepted cash!  You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.  

I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.  

While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalapeños, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.

One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.  

The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....

My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!"}
