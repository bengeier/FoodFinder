{"text":"I did not feel welcome here. The place has a gentrified feel and the staff was aloof. The ice cream was decent but frankly it gave me a terrible stomach ache a hour later. It was not particularly rich, so I was worried about food poisoning. Between that and the price, you're better off buying a quality brand from whole foods."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I live in the area. Unfortunately, I've been there three times and each time the ice cream has been bland and forgettable. The salted caramel today actually had ice chips all through it and the \"best\" chocolate tastes different every time. Rather than the best, the adjective they should use is inconsistent. I'd rather go to a sporting event and pay 5 dollars for a lackluster soft serve cone."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Waffle cones are a must. Can't wait until the new one opens downtown!"}
{"text":"the ice cream is always fantastic! my only complaint is that the inside of the place sometimes smells a little funky-sweet (just a little bit). the workers are also very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened up. The ice cream is delicious and fresh. The waffle cones are made fresh and the two times I've gone in the cone is still warm! Delicious!! I usually have my ice cream without a cone, not crazy for them, but these are so good."}
{"text":"I got their Vietnamese coffee and chocolate ice cream. Fantastic, would definitely stop by again"}
{"text":"The staff here is so great and the waffle cones were delicious! We tried vanilla, pb, and salted caramel and all were delicious. A great place!!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Pittsburgh. Small batch homemade flavors that are ever changing and always interesting. Expect a line but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Pittsburgh and my aunt took me here for ice cream. Their salted caramel is the single most fantastic ice cream I've ever tasted. It tastes raw and real and not over processed like other ice cream. I highly recommend this place. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Best ice cream I ever had. They serve made from scratch ice creams with options of fresh made waffle, or in a cup.
No artificial stuff, all real ingredients you would use to make ice creams at home.
I really love the coconut and lime one.
It tastes so good I wanna cry :p"}
{"text":"While they have interesting flavours, and are obviously popular going by the line, the ice cream was way too sweet for me! Tasted great except for this one thing. I would share one small cup between four people for the amount of sugar it has."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Love the peanut butter, salted caramel, chocolate, vanilla, and ricotta. Clean store, beautiful decor, very friendly and helpful staff. Was nice trying out all the flavors (cute spoons). Can't wait to have this be the new place I frequent down the street! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Millie's ice cream is very good. But the fresh, housemade waffle cones are possibly even better. Lots of delicious flavors ranging from unique to classic. It is on the pricy side but if you can afford it the quality is absolutely worth the splurge."}
{"text":"The ice cream is excellent quality, the waffle cones are the best, and the service is commendable. It is a very clean and well run establishment with a nice relaxing laid back vibe. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Unique flavors and seasonals, great location for dessert or pre dinner wait, and wonderfully busy atmosphere keeping it lively. Favorite ice cream place in pittsburgh. Great walk-to spot if you live in the nearby neighborhoods!

Update: didn't mean to have this a four star review, most definitely a five star!"}
{"text":"My sweet tooth was clamoring after dinner on a weekday, so I decided to visit Shadyside for Millie's, which I'd had bookmarked. The store was set further back from the street and had a couple of picnic tables out in front. When I walked in around 7:30 pm, the line was already to the door. However, it moved quickly, and I needed that time to consider all the flavors anyway!

I tried \"the best chocolate\" and pistachio rose. Their tasting spoons are metal and reusable. The chocolate had a very strong chocolate flavor, but it wasn't as dark as I was hoping for, so I went with a scoop of pistachio rose and a scoop of strawberry ice cream in a bowl ($4). There are tables and bar seating inside, as well as picnic benches in front and behind the shop. Since it was nice out, I enjoyed my ice cream outside.

The pistachio rose ice cream had a subtler flavor which less sweetness. I tasted honey. The pistachios gave the ice cream a nice crunch. The strawberry ice cream had a very strong, intense strawberry flavor, which was great. By the end of the scoop, though, it got a little too sweet. 

Can't wait to try some other flavors, a waffle cone, and maybe the brioche!"}
{"text":"The flavors they offer are so interesting, and I was so pleased to see that they offer lavender ice cream, which was absolutely delicious. Beware, though -- the ice cream is truly rich and creamy, so it can feel very heavy after having eaten only a single scoop. But it's a lovely spot to treat yourself. The interior and exterior as well are adorable. A must-go for all ice cream lovers"}
{"text":"Went there for a date night a few months back and cannot get enough of this place ! ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! Best place hands down in shadyside also location is perfect!"}
{"text":"Go to Millie's right now! I had desperately been missing a local dog-friendly ice cream shop, and Millie's is the perfect answer. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful to me and my dog, the space is beautiful, and the ice cream is delicious. Trust me, if you're looking for a spot for a first date, friend date, self date, 500th date, dog date - there is no occasion for which Millie's isn't the answer. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is definitely worth the wait. You can taste the freshness of their ingredients. Make sure to taste a flavor that you are not familiar with before ordering as not all flavors are for everybody's taste. But when you find the ones you like, you will enjoy them.
We will definitely be visiting again together and with friends."}
{"text":"This place had some of the most distinct flavours of ice creams that I've tried. It had a lavender falvoured ice cream which I found really nice with a great subtle taste coming in from the lavender. Their waffles are amazing too.. They have some flavours like salted caramel as well which again seemed new and fascinating to me ... Definitely worth trying if you're in and around the Shadysife neighbourhood.."}
{"text":"Not only is the ice cream some of the best in the city, they have Lactaid at the counter so I can still treat myself, and the music selections playing in the shop are top notch."}
{"text":"Rich, flavorful ice cream served by a patient staff; they told me that there are unlimited samples! The white chocolate with toasted almonds and cherries tasted just like its description in ice cream form. And the almonds were perfectly toasted. The salted caramel was very rich and equally true to its namesake. Both delicious. I tried The coconut lime and rhubarb sorbets which were fine - I'm not a huge sorbet fan. They were true to taste but not sweet enough for me. My mom loved the coconut. But to me, it just tasted like lime-flavored coconut cream. 

Overall, Millie's has richly authentic flavors which make it a unique and worthwhile treat for your tastebuds.

5/5 for ice cream
3.5/5 for sorbet"}
{"text":"I knew this place was going to be good before even checking it out on Yelp because of the huge line that snakes right out the front door seemingly all night long.  Before even talking about the ice cream, the smell coming out the door of this place from the freshly prepared waffle cones is seductive and delicious, it's that good.  The waffle cones are as delicious as they smell.

My girlfriend and I have had several ice cream flavors now across our visits including 'best chocolate', vanilla, salted caramel, strawberry, pineapple, and dark chocolate.

We're both chocolate lovers and the 'best chocolate' flavor is indeed our favorite flavor of ice cream here, but they're all good.

The service is prompt and as fast as it can be, but the line takes a while to move through because everyone likes to get several free samples when they get to the counter which slows things down somewhat.

The prices are fair and the staff is friendly.

They sell pints as well, so we'll have to pick up some to devour at home sometime."}
{"text":"Millie's started out as an ice cream CSA, where the owner, Chad, made all of the bases and ice cream in his home. We were original CSA subscribers, and I'm so glad that we jumped onto this train early on.  After securing a local production facility and pasteurizer so they could continue to make their own ice cream base, making them one of the only TRUE \"homemade\" ice creams in Pgh, the scoop shop opened. Millie's is the best ice cream and sorbet that I've ever had, hands down. Millie's has turned me into an ice cream snob, and I just CAN'T have any other ice cream. Their homemade waffle cones are THE BEST (look for a marshmallow at the bottom of the yummy cone) and the warm brioche ice cream sandwiches are TO DIE FOR!! I'm salivating as I write this. Too bad I live so far away from the city. I can only wish and hope that Chad and Lauren will open a location in the burbs of the South Hills!!"}
{"text":"Yummo! Such rich and unique ice cream flavors. Slightly overpriced for the portions, but would I go back? You bet!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after eating next door at noodlehead, I used to come here all the time when it was Oh Yeah. Really eclectic flavors I got Thai iced tea and Vietnamese coffee. Very fun decor!"}
{"text":"Millie's Ice Cream is always delicious.  It is exceptionally creamy.  I like trying their rotating flavors, but chocolate and vanilla are also to-die-for.  If I had to knock anything about Millie's, it would be that the ice cream is too soft and melts fairly quickly.  Other than that, it is my favorite place to go for dessert."}
{"text":"Ice cream is fantastic but had to leave the long line...hankering for affogato and miss the option to have :("}
{"text":"One of, if not THE best ice cream in Pittsburgh.   Amazing flavors with incredible depth, richness and texture.   The Vietnamese coffee is extraordinary, the pistachio rose is really unique.    Chocolate is solid, but not their best offering -- that said, it is head and shoulders above 95% of any other ice cream in the city.   A must-visit."}
{"text":"Millie's isn't your classic ice cream parlor. It might not even be for your average ice cream lover. Grab a sample of any house made flavor and you'll understand. Their ice cream is rich, sweet, and tasteful. Creative flavors like Vietnamese coffee, lavender, and almond butter and honey are refreshing and balanced. Nothing overpowering. They make their waffle cones in house and they're like candy. Tastes even better than they smell. Grab a picnic bench seat out back or stay cool in their bright and welcoming interior. Skip dessert at a nearby restaurant and walk to Millie's instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED the ice cream here! It will probably be our new favorite spot for date night! Staff was very friendly, speedy service, great selection, and tastes amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Waffle cones are perfect, ice cream is perfect. The peanut butter is the best peanut butter ice cream I've had, and the pumpkin is certainly up there too. The line can get a bit long, but you'll know it's worth it when you get inside and smell the glory of freshly made waffle cones. Oh and they list all the ingredients in each of their flavors-- hard to feel bad about treating yourself when you know exactly what you're eating :)"}
{"text":"The staff was nice, but I think seven dollars for a vanilla milkshake is outrageous, especially given the size of the cup. It was a good milkshake, but not worth 7 bucks. Maybe some of the fancier flavors are worth it. I'll have to come back and see. 

(3.5 stars)"}
{"text":"Updated Review: 5 Stars
Ok, 2nd try is a charm. I went with the Lemon and Vietnamese Coffee during this visit, and both were perfect. Subtle flavors this go around, and the waffle cone was great, not overcooked this time.

Original Review: 3 Stars
Finally got around to stopping here after going to dinner down the street, and glad we did. Pretty long line for a Saturday so I felt a little pressured to order quickly, and only tried 2 flavors (Thai Iced Tea and Coconut Lime). Thai Iced Tea had too strong of an anise flavor so I opted for the latter as it was a unique combo.

The texture was different, and presumably they used coconut milk to make the base, but it was refreshing, not too heavy. The smell inside was intoxicating but I didn't find myself loving the waffle cone. It was good, but there are better options in Pittsburgh.

The spot itself is beautifully remodeled and the staff was very pleasant, and the costs were reasonable. I hope to stop back soon and find a flavor I love, but still recommend the visit as it was satisfying overall."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in to check this place out after grabbing a late lunch at Noodlehead next door. First off, we went in the dead of Winter and it was snowing heavily outside. Not really the best time for ice cream, but since I looooooove all things sweet I wanted to peek in. 

The young woman working, Brittany, was so friendly and welcoming. She offered us samples and shared the background story of the shop with us. We felt so welcomed, thank you Brittany! 

We ended up buying a quart of ice cream. They have so many delicious and unique flavors. 

Awesome surprise stop!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Ice cream.  Unique flavors & quality ingredients make their ice cream stand out.  Super cute store-front as well."}
{"text":"We go to Millie's at least once per week. The ice cream is excellent, the cones are worth the trip on their own, and the atmosphere is happy and fun. I usually like ice cream with a bunch of stuff in it but Millie's chocolate ice cream is simply fantastic and doesn't need anything. So good."}
{"text":"Okay. We came here for dinner (no regrets!) one night this week.

They just opened so I'm going to cut them some slack on this, but the service was a bit discombobulated. Mack ordered first and by the time I was ready no one would make eye contact with me for a bit. It was odd. Again, they are surely still working out the kinks, so not mad about it.

The ice cream was delicioso. I had peanut butter and chocolate in a cone and it was divine.

Mack ordered dulce de leche and chocolate in a cone and his cone was not made properly and not 3 minutes after we left it had dripped out of the side of the bottom and all over his clothes. It should have been sealed up, and they even put some marshmallow in the bottom to prevent drips, but his cone wasn't wrapped tight enough when it was made so it leaked all over. He was sad. So, I would recommend checking your cone for structural integrity and maybe asking for a bowl for backup."}
{"text":"Quality and taste of ice cream is amazing!  Thick and creamy and everything I dreamed of!  I had a scoop of the lavender  and one of strawberry, both delicious. This will be my new go-to place for ice cream. Staff is super friendly, too :)"}
{"text":"Loved the homemade ice cream from Millie's as it was a recommendation from my sister who lives in Pittsburgh. The lines were long but that was a testament to the popularity of the ice cream. I had the chocolate in a cone, one scoop was enough for me. My husband had the maple and bourbon milk shake which he drank down quickly. He liked that it was neither too thin or thick. The gave him a thick straw.  We sat outside on one of the three picnic benches.  

Note: this has stairs and I didn't see a wheelchair accessible entrance."}
{"text":"Went with a group of four on a Saturday night to satisfy an ice cream craving we all had (plus none of us were completely ready to call it a night).  The line was almost out the door, but we stuck it out and it was worth it.

The flavor selection is limited.  But that's fine.  You want the five spice honey flavor ice cream.  Don't question it, just accept that it will become your new favorite.  

You'll want to get two scoops and have it in a waffle cone.  It's slightly pricier than some other ice cream places, but it's worth it.  Plus the waffle cone comes with marshmallows at the bottom to keep the ice cream from leaking out which is really clever and a great way to end your ice cream cone.

Finally,  the weather's getting nice so i would recommend sitting outside to enjoy your cone.  It gets a bit crowded and loud at the inside tables, so take advantage of it."}
{"text":"Ice cream was great! The inside of the shop smelled delightful! There was a line to the door which is a always a good sign. I ordered a waffle cone with dulce de leche and Vietnamese coffee. Both were creamy and delicious. The waffle cone was the freshest I've ever tasted. The marshmallows at the bottom of the cone were a nice treat, since I love marshmallows. My husband got a chocolate milkshake and that shit was BOMB! 
 
Service was decent but I'm a little concerned with the lady working behind the counter with long dreads that nearly dipped into the ice cream every time she reached down to scoop some out. Health code violation? 

5 starts for the ice cream and service but minus 1 for the dread lock dipping , which was a little concerning :\

I would still come back, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty. Love the shop and the fancy flavors, tho I'd prefer not to wait in a long line!"}
{"text":"This is apparently the spot to go to for ice cream in Shadyside.  It is legit always packed.  The smells coming from this place from the homemade waffle cones are heavenly.  I've only had the Vietnamese coffee ice cream and it is good enough that I'll prob never try another flavor."}
{"text":"Millie's is a bright clean darling ice cream shop selling homemade ice cream in their regular flavors as well as some seasonal offerings. They also have delicious popular waffle cones made onsite. Some Yelp comments mentioned the flavors being overpowerful, so I was drawn to the Toasted Oat Maple flavor which was delightfully light. I added peppermint as well. I wish I had gone for one of the bolder flavors, though.

One thing that is a major challenge for me at Millie's is the entrance with steps. The first two are manageable, the second two are challenging and the last one is impossible fir me without help. There is an iron railing, but it is merely decorative.

One thing I really like about this place is when you ask for small scoops, they truly give you small scoops. I still didn't finish it due to a large dinner, but at least there wasn't a ton of wasted ice cream.

The flavors are good. I didn't detect sny graininess or particles of ice in the cream. It was straightforward good homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend, and was definitely satisfied with the experience.  My partner and I have been wanting to try Millie's for a while now.  We were actually already stuffed from a big lunch, but on a hot day, who doesn't want ice cream?  Although full, as said, I decided on 3 scoops - honey pistachio, chocolate and a maple bourbon.  My partner ordered a brioche ice cream sandwich.  WHAT you say?  Brioche ice cream sandwich?  Why yes, you heard correctly.  What a unique thing to serve.  Although I forget the ice cream she had it loaded with, I won't forget the look on her face when she tasted it.  Heavenly would be a good description.  My three flavors tasted just as described.  The ice cream was light and delicious.  Beyond the interesting ice flavor combos they served up, they also offered sorbet and the typical vanilla and chocolate.  I think that's nice because it lends itself to bringing customers in who want the regular when their compadres want to try something different.  We sat inside, but there are picnic tables in the front and back which were available.  A very enjoyable experience.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had to see what all the hype was about.  Is the ice cream good, yes. Is it the best ever, no.   The flavors are weird. I am more into your cookie dough or mint chocolate chip. These flavors were all over the place and many fruit flavors which I am not that keen on.  I went with the chocolate and my husband got the salted caramel which were both tasty. We were both so glad that we upgraded and got it in a waffle cone which I typically do not do and usually go with a cup.  Hands down this was the best waffle cone I have ever had. I don't know what they do to make it taste that good but it is so worth it and honestly the flavor of ice cream doesn't even matter. The line was long but we stuck it out. The prices are fine and they have a great indoor and outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream place in the city. They always have unique (white chocolate port, tin roof, lavender, etc.) and classic (peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) flavors. I ended up going twice last week with my husband. The first night he enjoyed the Vietnamese coffee and I got peanut butter topped with their homemade chocolate syrup (more of fudge sauce- highly recommend!). We came back the next night for a chocolate take over. The service is always excellent- staff is upbeat and friendly, allow you endless samples. Definitely a gem in the Pittsburgh dessert community."}
{"text":"I love this icecream shop. This is my favorite place to get icecream with Dave and Andys being my second choice. It's always a great treat to come after dining at Noodlehead right next door too! 

My go-to flavor would be the Vietnamese Coffee. I'm a big fan of anything coffee flavor so I knew I would like this one. You can taste that the icecream here is rich and homemade. Definitely try it with their homemade waffle cones or even add the waffle chips on top! My second go-to flavor would be The Best Chocolate."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have a horrible horrible sweet tooth.  I am always on the look out for a great ice cream/ frozen yogurt place.  Decided to give Millie's a try and I was not disappointed.  First, if you look on their website you can see the ingredients of most of the ice creams you will encounter at the store, this trend likewise carries over to their store where the ingredients are listed under the ice cream title.  Second, love the atmosphere.
As you ascend the stairs to this quaint little place, you almost go back in time.  The interior is rather retro and you get to really take a look around as you wait in the inevitable line.  I ended up getting the salted caramel, which was super creamy and smooth.  Unfortunately, this ice cream is REALLLLLLY salty.  I love salt but i couldn't finish this one.  Even so, the ice cream was excellent and next time ill be trying something on the chocolate spectrum.  You can bet I'll be back...in fact I may as well step up my cardio game in preparation ha ha.

Update!
So since my previous review I have tried a few flavors:
1.  Honey Bourbon: This is my absolute flavor.  It is a light hint of honey with. mild flavor of bourbon, nothing too sweet or overwhelming.  Its just a nice refreshing soft cool flavor for a warm evening.  
2.  Chocolate:  No joke, this is super chocolatey.  Unfortunately when I tried it...it was late evening and they literally had to scrape the bottom of the barrel... As such, my ice cream was kind of grainy and chalky... but I'm sure its better as long as they don't scrape the bottom for you.
I'll keep you guys updated as I continue my stroll this enviable path of indulgence."}
{"text":"Their ice cream is the best I have tried in Pittsburgh. You can try the flavors before you make decision about what flavors you want to choose. I tried the best chocolate, Vietnamese coffee, coconut lime, super delicious! The waffle core also tastes good!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the cute interior and outside seating. Didn't care for the ice cream. So sweet burned my throat. My niece ate the salted caramel and liked it. I had the white chocolate with nuts. Glad I tried it once."}
{"text":"Good tasting ice cream.  Not \"the best in the world\" as some of the other reviewers would have you believe but it is perfectly good tasting.

The line was a pretty long wait, and I think the main reason for this is that one of the workers seemed to be doing all the work, while the other 2 workers were just standing in the back talking to each-other the whole time I was there.  Maybe if they helped out the line would move quicker.

I had to wash my hands twice because the counter where you pay was sticky and my ice cream toppings were overflowing and unavoidably made my hands sticky.  But a problem is there is no hand dryer or paper towels to dry your hands in the bathroom.

Also pretty expensive, it was $7.49 for a Sundae $2.75 for a small bottle of water (the bottle of water was also sticky too).  I would have taken a picture of the receipt but they said they ran out of receipt paper.  They said they ran out of several of the toppings also.

It's kind of a neat quirky place tho, like the ice cream scoop door knobs, and a very simple menu with unique flavors and they say it's all home made and from local farmers and stuff.  It just didn't live up to all the hype for me."}
{"text":"So.... I bought another pint of the Vietnamese coffee and it wasn't the same at all. The intense espresso punch was gone, and it was way too sweet.  Hopefully they get to the point where there is product consistency.  Rooting for them!"}
{"text":"Vanilla had no flavor whatsoever and something was wrong with the texture. Chocolate was just OK. All 3 of us didn't even finish. Millies doesn't hold a candle to Brusters or even Breyers for that matter."}
{"text":"Millie's is BAE. That's really all there is to it. They have such a cool twist on traditional flavors, and I love the fact that they use local ingredients! They rotate their flavors often (besides flavors like vanilla, chocolate, coffee, etc) to stay on season, so you know the ingredients they're using are fresh. The lines can get long, but to me that just shows how good it is. It's truly unfortunate for my diet that their new location in Market Square is a 5 minute walk from my office."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to get ice cream here. I've had the cinnamon, pistachio, 5 spice honey, peanut butter, and salted caramel, and chocolate. Not necessarily in 1 trip, or more than 2 trips. All were amazing."}
{"text":"They have my favorite ice cream in the whole city. They are always so nice and let you try a sample of any flavor you would like! I love their Chocolate, Strawberry Sorbet, and Blueberry. I will say their fruit flavored ones taste so fresh I often get those. It is just the best around. They also just opened a location downtown that is just as good as the one in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"The shady side shop is awesome but I recently tried one of the ice cream sandwiches made with their ice cream and macaron shells at Gaby et Jules and I do not have words to express how thoroughly delightfully delicious that treat was. Go. Get. One. OMG."}
{"text":"Horrible. If you're looking for a real sugar coma this is where you go. I'm already upset with the fact that they changed the best and the most authentic coffee shop in Pittsburgh into this ridiculously pink ice cream lab looking place. But I guess it matches the purpose if you're serving something that looks like ice cream but tastes like nothing but pure sugar. Seriously, you can't even taste any kind of flavors, all you get is lots of sugar! I have a sweet tooth and happen to be a real ice cream lover but I could not finish one scoop of butter pecan ice cream. There is no way I'm going back, if you want ice cream in shadyside either go to Mercurios or Jitters! 
Edit after 1 year: the fact that the owner is secretly tagging the reviews as \"funny\" doesn't make a big difference. It is not ice cream, it is candy that looks like ice cream."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is super cute! We will go in here and grab an ice cream while waiting for our takeout order from Noodlehead right next store. I'm the type of person that once I try something, I continually return to that flavor. However, I was encouraged to try the Vietnamese coffee and it was delightful! There are several flavors including their featured ones, and I'm certain that anyone can find a flavor that they enjoy. I always love their cones; very rarely do I get a cup. Even the though the line is usually long extending out the door to the sidewalk, it moves at a good pace. There's indoor seating as well as a few tables outside on the deck."}
{"text":"Great spot to come for an evening dessert or a cold treat on a hot day. Homemade ice creams with seasonal flavors that really hit home. The fresh-smelling waffle cone scent as you walk in the door paired with the friendly staff really makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"Good ice cream, although it is not to die for, I have tried better ones in town. This place has a nice environment and I like the benches outside!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES. I am the type of person who generally needs stuff mixed in my ice cream - i.e. Ben and Jerry's all the way. I did not realize that this was because I had never TRULY had good ice cream - and it's not like I haven't tried. Millie's is DELICIOUS - their every flavor is fresh and amazing and unique and completely satisfying in and of itself which speaks to its quality. I dream of Millie's. My only complaint is that they only had birthday cake ice cream one day, and I was not in town! 

In short, my only complaint is that I want more Millie's which is obviously not a real complaint. LOVE YOU MILLIE'S."}
{"text":"Ice cream is fine, but many less flavors than the old place that was here. And I miss squirrel meat (if you don't understand don't worry about it)"}
{"text":"I had a double scoop of the dark chocolate and the walnut sorbet and it was really really good. You can definitely taste the difference between this ice cream and other ice cream stores- a fresher flavor. Close to a bus stop and has outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"The staff and ice cream at Millie's are incredibly great! Always a great treat after eating Noodlehead."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and the line was out the door! I absolutely loved my first few licks of the ice cream, but not so much for the last few licks, making this very hard for me to decide on an appropriate rating for Millie's. The ice cream flavors are so creative and they're flavors you usually don't find anywhere else. The hubby and I got Vietnamese Coffee and Thai Iced Tea flavors and they were both to die for until we got halfway into them and we were just so sick of the sugar overload. We also opted for the waffle cone ($1 extra) which added even more sweetness to our already super sweet scoops. I will say, though, the flavors we had were on point; tasted exactly like Vietnamese coffee and Thai tea! However, just a bit too rich after a while. The hubby usually cannot get enough of ice cream but he couldn't finish his cone at Millie's. Unfortunately, him and I both wasted some ice cream which was a shame because they were absolutely delicious. You probably don't hear this much, but perhaps a smaller portion would make the delicious flavors more enjoyable. 

It's definitely spacious in here with both indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is bright and fresh and the workers are friendly, patient and helpful. Overall, I would come here again and again no matter how long the line was, but maybe do without the waffle cone to cut down my sugar intake ever so slightly."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. 

My first visit to Millie's and it was an amazing one! Everyone raves about their VIETNAMESE COFFEE ice cream but I thought I'd try the HONEY PISTACHIO instead. Yummmmmm. Although.. it was  like, not that creamy? Like what you'd expect of ice cream? BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD. My only complaint was that I ordered the small and it was too much ice cream for me.. I have a sweet tooth but it was just too much... I should get the mini next time!

The inside is so brightly lit and cute and there's seating inside and outside. They even sell lactaid for $0.50! (An amazing idea I have to say)

I will most def be returning :)."}
{"text":"Well, like fools to the slaughter, back we went.  I'm tentative to leave an unpleasant review when others I respect are Millie's fans.  BUT, it was just bad.  All three times.  We kept thinking they were working out kinks and then the final time, I took my sisters who were charmed by the adorable exterior and craving ice cream.

My sister enthusiastically bit into her salted caramel in a waffle cone and said it was good though it couldn't compare to Jeni's of Nashville where my sister is a local.  Then a few minutes later, her face soured and she said she had an unpleasant greasy mouth coating like the one I'd experienced.  She noted later, that she could not get rid of the coating and how icky it was.

I don't know if Millie's is thinking a ridiculously high fat content will prove addictive but, it ends up feeling like eating a stick of frozen butter.  Not creamy, but flaky and greasy and the horrible mouth coating dulls the flavor which is the only pleasant part of the experience.

The waffle cone was great the first time, but slightly burnt the next so less pleasant and I found half my sister's cone in my car trash bin later."}
{"text":"Until they are properly staffed, don't come here. Waited in line for 25 minutes for good-not wait in line for 30 minutes- ice cream. Their waffle cones are AMAZING but when we finally got to the front they were out of waffle cones and the staff was pretty rude about it and not apologetic at all...Overall not worth the long wait here."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed when I went. The texture of the ice cream was so-so, with a lot of crystals that made it feel grainy. It wasn't all that creamy. The vanilla was way too sweet for my liking, and the caramel wasn't intense enough. It's good, but not fantastic. Given the prices, I would expect fantastic. I think the interior is lovely (especially compared to Oh Yeah), but I'm concerned that there seems to be more focus on that part of the business than the desserts. Either way, it's a lovely, albeit pricey, post-dinner treat after visiting Noodlehead. It's just not the best on offer in the area."}
{"text":"They sell ice-cream!!! What more to say. Just go and enjoy this charming establishment and yummy goodies. You can sample flavors, and the scoops are very generous. Choose to have your ice-cream or sorbet in a cup, waffle or sugar cone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! When you first walk in it smells amazing.  Lots of delicious and fun flavor to pick from. The line was long and out the door but we waited and it went pretty fast.  If you love icecream Go here!!"}
{"text":"Creamy ice cream. I had the \"best chocolate\" and the Vietnamese coffee ice cream, which worked very well together. They gave me half a scoop of each which was very nice. My wife had the mango coconut which has a nice zing to it and a subtle but sweet coconut finish. I can't seem to find gelato in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream but I would just to sit in there & smell the waffle cones cooking. I am usually a cup gal, but after smelling one of the most delicious scents in my life I had to try the waffle cone. It. Was. Amazing. So sweet & flavorful. It was like cake but crunchy. My whole family of 5 had the junior size & the portion was generous. The staff was friendly & the decor is adorable with inside or outside seating."}
{"text":"I love ice cream, especially unique flavors of ice cream. Millie's has its for standard flavors (including chocolate, vanilla, Vietnamese coffee, and salted caramel) and rotates through a few others. I tried a sample of the pistachio rose and hated it (sorry, but at least I can say it's just me, not the ice cream). I also tried a sample of the caramel and it was amazing. 

With a small you get 2 scoops ($4, they're pretty but scoops, which filled my waffle cone) so you can get 2 flavors, but I didn't want to mix anything with my perfect caramel. The waffle cone is an extra $1--they use a marshmallow as a stopper in the bottom to prevent your ice cream from melting through!  The place is really bright and clean and sometimes they have a back patio open for you to enjoy your ice cream."}
{"text":"Everyone has been talking about how great Millie's was so we had to try it.

I had the best chocolate ice cream & thought it was good, but definitely not the best I've had. My mom and cousin had it too and felt the same.

The girl who got our ice cream was nice & let us try the ice cream before we bought some. The lady who ring us up was really snotty. 

It is not a very warm place and the ice cream was just ok. I would not go back."}
{"text":"The best yummy ice cream i had in this region. Only comparable to pleasure i get from the eating the NYC frappes and Icecreams at Greenwich village. Ola ola....can't wait for my next trip there."}
{"text":"Yea they were awesome. Different unusual flavors and nice staff and nice place. They use actual metal spoons for tasting which is very nice and matches the quality of what they make. I literally tried every flavor before purchasing and the dude was totally cool. I think my favorite was the cantaloupe and tangerine sherbet. Wow that was amazing. The ice cream I went with was almond butter it reminded me of my mothers almond butter cake. Soo good. The hazelnut I mixed with ended up being not as good as I thought in the beginning. The waffle cone was made fresh as well. I even got to taste a flavor they ran out of which was awesome. The Vietnamese coffee. Seriously through the sherbet was fantastic. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, great atmosphere; ideal for a quick ice cream stop. The price was good, there was not a lot of options but that was expected as the ice cream is homemade. My only regret was not taking advantage of the waffle cones which they rolled on site and not trying the waffles. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again definitely going back!"}
{"text":"4.2/5 

Millie's offers some of the creamiest ice cream I've ever had! And you gotta love their made-in-house waffle cone (the whole store smells like it) .

1. Banana pudding ice cream with salted peanuts. - great taste! I wish there are actually banana chunks in there. 
2. Chad's Vanilla ice cream Milkshake. Probably the creamiest milkshake ever  - must get! 
-
A must visit if you ever stop by Pgh. Great spot for date or family after a meal!"}
{"text":"Ended up here 10 minutes before close on a whim. My usual go-to for unique ice cream had a dissapointing menu this evening so I hiked it fast from Crafton to Shadyside.

My perseverance was well worth it! I could tell from the long line that I had made a good choice. Then I saw the menu.... lavender! Pistachio Rose! Floral flavors. You get me Millie! Thank you! 

I sampled each of those and decided on a lavender for there and then and a pint of the Rose Pistachio to go. And since I'm an adult I might totally have that for breakfast tomorrow!

I took it to go as they closed soon but I saw there was ample seating both inside and out. I'll utilize those when I go back.

Soon. Very soon."}
{"text":"Cutest little place and you are hit with the smell of their sweet, fresh waffle cones as soon as you enter. The flavor selection was a little eccentric for my taste. I think they're trying to appeal to those with an interest in organic, beet and lavender flavored ice cream just doesn't sound enticing to me. I got plain vanilla with sprinkles, which ended up being a bit overpriced since I didn't get something quirky, but it was honestly worth it for that waffle cone. So. Fresh. And so sweet! I loved the cone and could see myself just getting a cone and breaking it apart and eating it like crackers in the future. I'm sure it's happened..."}
{"text":"believe the hype, and do it right-get the freshly made waffle cone."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best ice cream I have ever had this side of the Mississippi!!! Millies is my absolute favorite place to go for ice cream.  I have been here at least 20 to 30 times as sad as it sounds, but their ice cream is just to die for!  They have so many unique flavors that keep you coming back for more.  I always stick with my standard of the Vietnamese coffee in about of this world waffle cone and add on another seasonal flavor.  My absolute all-time favorite besides the Vietnamese is a toasted rice and citrus which I have not seen since last summer and I'm sad :(. 

We also picked up pints to go in addition last June I ordered my husband's birthday cake from Here.  We did lemon ice cream on the top and strawberry ice cream on the bottom with a crushed waffle cone crossed and waffle cones along the side of the cake.  It was pricy, but totally worth it! 

Millie's we will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"New and exciting flavors with the high quality that you expect. Didn't disappoint. Filled our expectations of what a good ice cream place should be. Lemon ice cream was amazing. O paired it with fresh blueberries at home to really set it off. Also bought rhubarb crisp which had a great flavor and we added some additional rhubarb at home and topped it with some maple syrup for a different take on it. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Had this for the first time this afternoon awesome place so nicely decorated ... The employees are very happy and greet you when you walk in ... You can try every flavor if you so wish I had the Vietnamese coffee OUT OF THIS WORLD .... Can't wait to go back ........"}
{"text":"So I love ice cream and I can't believe I've never been here. My friends and I went to dinner on a Saturday night and really wanted something sweet afterwards. Millie's is on Highland near a bunch of restaurants, so it's the perfect nightcap to any dinner. 

I walked in and the first thing you notice is how clean it is. It's also very well lit. I mean ice cream really does make me happy, but so does Millie's ambience. 

I ordered 2 scoops of Vanilla and Vietnamese coffee. Both really good. The scoops were huge, so I probably could have gotten away with just one scoop of ice cream. It took me forever to eat it. The service was super quick. 

After getting our sweets, we sat down at one of the tables. Once again, super nice and clean. We stayed and talked for about 2 hours. And no one disturbed us. The staff just let us hang even after we were done with our ice cream. 

This restaurant is on a busy street with lots of other eateries, so anticipate a line. It got pretty busy when we were there."}
{"text":"Yum! I love Ice Cream. I have spent a lot of time in Columbus and Millie's is definitely the closest thing Pittsburgh has to Jeni's, though I have to say that Jeni's still wins by a landslide. 

The store is cutely decorated, friendly and inviting. We came with a group of four on a rainy Saturday around 4pm and we only waited a few minutes and easily found a table inside. I had Chad's Vanilla and the Salted Caramel. The ice cream was really tasty but I will note that it does have more of an icy texture rather than being on the extremely creamy side as others have mentioned. Fine by me, but it's not for everyone. 

I had my ice cream in a bowl but my friend got the waffle cone and it looked delicious. It's nice that they put a little marshmallow in the bottom so the ice cream doesn't drip out. 

Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee flavors that I sampled were also delicious. I like how they reuse the sample spoons...who can argue with being green! 

The ice cream was a bit on the pricey side but that is to be expected with a gourmet shop like this. The prices were right on par with Jeni's. for 4 of us each getting two scoops and one waffle cone it came to a little under $19."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite ice cream stores! I love the welcoming smell of waffle cones the moment I step into the store. 

Millie's + Noodlehead (Thai place next door) is my favorite dinner combo in Pittsburgh. My favorite Millie's flavor is the Vietnamese Coffee, but I like trying a new flavor every time I go. I recommend getting the waffle cones, or if you're already too full (which is impossible because I believe that's there's always a second chamber for dessert), they have an option for junior scoop in a cup.

{"text":"This joint is dangerously close to my current digs. I've (sadly) not had the opportunity to go recently to check out fall offerings, but one of the standouts from this summer is the salted caramel ice cream, which is just out of this world (the caramel to cream ratio is high enough to leave your tongue coated with the caramel after each bite). Even walking by just for the smell of those delicious waffle cones is enough to make my mouth water. Such a lovely addition to the South Highland Ave. scene."}
{"text":"Millie's is my favorite ice cream in Pittsburgh. Millie's is better than Dave & Andy's. That's right Pittsburgh, you heard right, I prefer Millie's to the other hometown homemade ice cream shop. 

The shop is a little bit hipster and so are the people who work there, but it also has a laid back vibe with interesting flavors that are changed pretty regularly. I highly recommend salted caramel and lavender together. 

Do not let the long lines discourage you because they move very quickly."}
{"text":"Our family loves Millie's. Chad is awesome and has really come up with some great flavors that are ever changing. Millie's has everything from vanilla and chocolate to lavendar, thai tea, apricot saffron and so many more. 

We really love the picnic table seating out back because it's a little more private and let's the kiddo move around freely. There is plenty of seating inside and in the front as well.

The inside of Millie's is clean and white with an awesome Pittsburgh mural on one wall. Everything is simple but cute."}
{"text":"Well lets just say it's prefect timing for a new ice cream joint because of all the East Liberty construction and a new ice skating ring is coming to Shadyside at the Hunt Army place on Alder street near scared heart.

I was the very first customer but now I am the last to write an review.

Glad to have you here!!"}
{"text":"Millie's ice cream to start is such a great quality of ice cream that's rare in Pittsburgh. When my partner and I go, we like to both get two different flavors in our waffle cones and try all four. I can't get past making at least one \"the very best chocolate\" but we've had the lavender, goats milk blueberry (oh so good), the Vietnamese coffee, thai tea (alsoo so good) - needless to say: we've tried a lot. Never disappointing and has the added value of never knowing what you're going to get when you walk in- something could pop up on the menu you've never seen before and sounds even better than the rest. 

The place itself is adorable, but they had me at ice cream."}
{"text":"Great addition to Shadyside! They do the light subtle flavors best, overwhelmed by the richer ones and the waffle cone was weirdly soft, lacked a good crunch throughout (some people may like this).

Loved the ice cream texture- did not have any issues with it being too soft like another reviewer noted- it has a nice bite to it.

We took advantage of the very generous amt of sample tries from their ceramic tasting spoons (so fancy).

Banana rum - my favorite, banana really shone through!
Orange poppyseed- hubby got this and we enjoyed the creative flavor combo, tasted like a yummy poppyseed pastry
Vietnamese coffee- strong coffee notes but somehow did not wow me
Pistachio (mixed with something)- delicate light and delicious
Salted caramel- went on a whim and got a whole scoop of this without sampling because it got good reviews- total mistake. The caramel is so overwhelming and rich I almost felt sick and couldn't taste anything past the first bite, it was a tragedy but i ended up \"sacrificing\" the rest of the scoop into a trash can (unreal if you know me) just so I could enjoy the rest of my cone (filled with the banana winning flavor).

I will say the waffle cone $1 is a great way to up your ice cream volume but I was disappointed by the cone texture. Very weirdly soft and bendy on the inside. Not the crunch I was looking for.

I am giving this 4 stars because it is generally excellent artisan ice cream that usually hits the spot and fills an ice cream gap on the burgh!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice addition in the neighborhood. Friendly people and service (which is expected to further improve with time). The ice cream is delicious, home made and fresh. We have tried the chocolate, fig and caramel and they are all amazing! 

The environment is also nice and for all ages. You can sit on a table or at the \"bar\" and watching the making of waffles etc. certainly a place we will be visiting a lot during the summer!"}
{"text":"About a year and a half ago or so I read an article in Pittsburgh Magazine about this amazing ice cream CSA that would deliver pints of artisanal ice cream directly to your door.  It sounded too good to be true.  I immediately went to their website and signed up for the first of many.  Thus my love affair with Millie's Homemade Ice Cream was born.

From the very first delivery of Lemon Verbena, I melted with delight.  I enjoyed getting to try some of Chad's creations over the year (including Paw Paw, Mint Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Chicory, and Spumoni ice cream along with some great sorbets like Rhubarb and Arnold Palmer).  And to make it even better, the owners themselves (Chad and Lauren) were the ones who made the deliveries!  Every time I would greet one of them at the door we would talk about the previous flavors and they would tell me a bit about the new flavors.  It's exciting enough when someone brings you ice cream but this was a whole other level of customer service backing an amazing product.  When I heard they finally had a space to open up a scoop shop, I had mixed emotions.  Happy that they were able to realize their dream but also sad for myself that I now had to get my own ice cream.

Their new shop in Shadyside is a wonderful exhibit of their product.  It's simple yet unique.  A playful mural shows the stops along the way in the making Millie's Homemade Ice Cream.  They use local seasonal ingredients so the flavors will rotate making each trip to Millie's a whole new experience.  And even when the flavors are more complex, the ingredients are not.  I would always laugh while eating my CSA pints when I noticed how few ingredients are listed.  They've hired a small team of enthusiastic local college and high school students to man the scoops.  The kids seem to have learned quickly how to make a fresh waffle cone or panini up some brioche.

Yes, brioche.  The short menu at Millie's includes your scoops, your waffle cones, a few sundaes, floats....and brioche.  It's an idea Lauren told me they got at Epcot's French section where they put ice cream on a brioche bun and place it in a special panini press.  I had the orange marmalade with poppy ice cream on mine, quite possibly the best flavor combination.  I also had a waffle cone with Vietnamese Coffee and Dark Chocolate (made with Hop Farm Brewing's Fresh Pot of Porter) - another magical flavor combination.  Floats are made with Red Ribbon's root or birch beer.  They have a few pints for sale at the register, too, just in case you can't leave empty handed.

There is no limit on samples so be sure to taste as much as you'd like before deciding.  One current flavor is a coconut lime sorbet that is very refreshing.  There were several large water pitchers strategically located around the shop so it's not necessary to bother the staff for a drink.  I also noticed Lactaid for sale - it's like they thought of everything!  Inside there are a few tables and a bar for sitting as well as some counter space along the wall.  There is an outdoor deck that will be nice once the weather warms up.  

I'm so happy for their success and proud to have been a support since the CSA program.  Pictures I've seen from the first few days show long lines out the door.  Please don't let that discourage you.  There's a reason you might have to wait.  I'd give Millie's 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"There are excellent craft beer selections at some bars, but at Millie's there are excellent craft ice cream selections. 

I think they take the ice cream a bit seriously, but they cater to a hip/millenium vibe so I will let it slide.

Excellent waffle cones are made fresh and really adds a nice flavor and texture. 

Priced on high end but it's definitely high quality and you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"The best coffee ice cream and waffle cone i've ever had! The inside of the shop is so cute and they have water for dogs! My new fave ice cream shop"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm passionate about ice cream.  
I'm not sure what the buzz is about for this place. 
I get it - great ambience, friendly staff, ideal location
I've tried Millie's multiple times and it doesn't suit my tastes. 
The flavors just seem weird with some butter-heavy taste (particularly rose, pistachio).  I can't quite put a finger on it but there is something \"off\". 
Overall my policy is if someone wants to go and it's nearby I'll go, but this wouldn't be the first place I think of for ice cream."}
{"text":"Love Millie's! They have really interesting flavors and the texture is so good. Be warned though the regular sized cone has three massive scoops and you definitely will be satisfied after one! I've made the mistake multiple times and for some reason have been shocked every time I've gotten my massive cone."}
{"text":"Ice cream was okay, can make it much better. I felt they have really less flavors to choose from, which I didn't like it much. They have only 1 chocolate flavored ice cream that was little more on dark side. I like more of milky chocolate which they didn't had. My ratings:
Ice cream- 3/5
Service- 1/5
Ambience-2/5
Quality 3/5"}
{"text":"The ice cream was good but not great. I wasn't too impressed. Also a bit overpriced and I'm coming from NY."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream with absolutely creative flavors. You have your choice of a waffle cone or a cup. Small is 2 flavors, regular is 3 flavors. There's also a kid size. I saw sundaes on the menu,too. 

I tried the salted caramel and spiced rum banana, and both were outstanding. I'd like to return soon to try the fig and the chocolate porter. 

The store was packed, even on a weeknight, but the line went fairly quickly. It was after closing time when we left, but there was one woman pleading outside the door and they took pity on her and let her in, even though the staff was dead tired from working non-stop the whole night. 

Friendly place with great ice cream!"}
{"text":"A lovely local ice creamery with a classic walk-up counter and pints available for sale. Certainly holds the \"gourmet, local\" product price tag, but well worthwhile (and I am always partial and happy to support small & local businesses). Normally, I would spring for a unique flavor, especially when paying a premium, but honestly, the classic Vanilla is my favorite!! The seasonal sweet potato pie was also delicious - with creamy marshmallows :)"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of a friend. The waffle cones are a must! Yum! The store has about 9 available flavors, from standard chocolate, vanilla, coffee to some more exotic pear sherbet and ricotta cherry. You can order junior ($3) small ($4) or large ($5) and add a waffle cone for $1. I got a small which had two sizable scopes of vanilla and the BEST chocolate . The vanilla was a bit rich for me but the chocolate had a more subtle sweetness. The waffle cone was perfectly crispy and thick! I highly recommend. They also have floats and sundaes available. 

Think next time I'll get a junior as I was sugar overloaded by the end. I'd also try some of their more subtle less rich flavors like the sherbet. Also would love some outdoor seating in front. Will def be back in a nice day!"}
{"text":"Oh man, Millie's!! It's an awesome little hometown ice cream shop in East Liberty that provides a designer, high-quality experience with tasty ice cream options and delicious homemade waffle cones. 

Who should visit with me? It's like perfect for an after-dinner stop on a date. Or bring all your friends - perfect for that too! 

Favorite thing about this place: I mostly love the care and quality that the put into everything. The ice cream flavors, the decor - all awesome and incredibly inviting and comforting! 

I'd love it more if: I wasn't there on a busy night, but I think I'd love it more if they had a few more chairs inside and tables to sit at in general. But it's an ice cream shop - what could I expect? It just seems like more sating could fit in there. Maybe I'm wrong.

Ambience/Location: The location is great. We got street parking and it was super close. There wasn't a bit line when we went either - probably because it was so cold out, so only devoted ice cream eaters were coming out for dessert tonight! 

Service: Super friendly! My husband is lactose intolerant and they even have Lactaid pills available for purchase right on the counter. Perfect, brilliant idea! So thoughtful and it makes me buy in to the fact that they truly care about their customers!

Tips: 
1) Go on a cold night - you'll still love the ice cream and will get it super fast!
2) The \"regular\" size is two scoops - go for it! It's like the perfect amount if you're really craving some serious scoops
3) You can combine flavors in the same cone. 

Recommended Dish: I recommend pumpkin and chocolate. This is a weird taste fetish that I'm developing, and I love it. Seriously try it. If you love both flavors separately, you may really enjoy this! Dooooooo it!"}
{"text":"Only visited once and feel like I need to visit more times to really get a true feel of this spot. I will say that on a beautiful Spring Saturday, Millie's hit the spot. I went with the \"tin roof\" ice cream which was vanilla with caramel and peanuts. It was pretty good, but the peanuts were super large making it a little odd. My boyfriend got the chocolate and he loved it. The line was pretty long, which influenced me to fight my urge to ask for a bunch of samples. I'm hoping when I visit again the line will be shorter so I can try some more options and find my favorite flavor. The staff was so friendly and the ambiance was so cozy here. I also LOVED that they have vegan ice cream as well! So cool!"}
{"text":"Their ice cream is amazing. The family tried 3 different flavors - Vietnamese coffee, salted caramel, and the best chocolate. All were exceptional. And our 5-year old agreed that the chocolate was the best she's had. 

On top of that, the homemade wafflecones are delicious. Seeing and smelling them made in-house made the experience all the more enticing. 

While it is a small store space, it is family friendly. The bathroom was very clean and had a changing station (which is a big deal for families with small kids). And also kid-friendly menu options as the \"junior\" size cone or bowl is one scoop - which is perfect for the 5year old.

Highly recommended as this was the best ice cream we've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream. Excellent waffle cones. Very cute shop. 
However...the \"brioche bun\" is a swing and a miss. I like that they're trying but it should be removed from the menu. Don't order it and you'll love Millie's. Dear Millie, try doing the same thing but swapping the brioche for waffles or French toast. Not as \"creative\" but I promise it will be less disappointing."}
{"text":"Millie's is great! Their ice cream is flavorful, affordable, and homemade - what's not to love? I have been here a couple of times after visits in the area. The smell of homemade waffle cones wafting through the air is enough to make any ice cream lover weak in the knees. I love the mural on the far wall showing the story of how Millie's as we presently know it came to be. The staff is always friendly and willing to help you choose your flavor for the day. The few flavors I have tried have been yummy and I can't wait to go back and share this sweet spot with friends!"}
{"text":"I prefer this place over Dave & Andy's. I love the flavors! In the summer, Millie's is almost a daily ritual for my family!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I'm lactose intolerant and they had lactaid pills in a jar (which is so clever, but I always have my own pills). I got the vegan dark chocolate ice cream since that's the only way I know there's no dairy. Unfortunately, the cone had dairy but i didn't care at that point. It was so delicious! It tasted like chocolate pudding!"}
{"text":"I honestly do not know what else I can add that hasn't been said already.  This place is amazing, I mean how can you complain about an ice cream shop?  If you are currently thinking about a reason, shame on you.

I truly fell in love with this place.  They have taken their time to make a delicious, rich ice cream that I can actually partake in.  You can read that as this place is allergy friendly (to me at least).  Seriously, the ingredient list is simple, exactly how an ice cream should be made.  

Did I mention how rich this was?  It lit up my palate.  For as simple of a product it is, it has depth.  I purposefully did not eat every last drop so I could save it for later.  

The staff were delightful and very helpful with the product.  Yeah, so I'm going to end it here, like I said, what else can be added?  Don't want to be redundant or anything."}
{"text":"I think I have been here three times now. This is one of those few establishments in Pittsburgh that I genuinely crave, that's because it is so good. Ironically, I am allergic to ice cream. I have gone multiple years at a time without any ice cream because it makes me so sick; however, I keep want to coming back here over and over again. There is only one other kind of ice cream I crave this much and that is homemade ice cream from my friend who is a pastry chef. Most recently, I had white chocolate plum in a waffle cone. The ice cream had massive chunks of plums in it and it is so creamy! The waffle cones are made fresh there and they are delicious; my boyfriend thinks they are too sweet but I disagree. I recommend this place to all of my friends that live in the Pittsburgh area. I can't wait to come back once my tummy settles from my most recent visit."}
{"text":"Millie's is an adorable local ice cream place!  I tried the Vietnamese coffee and the lemon flavors (not together!) and they were both delicious.  You don't often see lemon in an ice cream (as opposed to sorbet). The texture was so smooth!

I appreciate that you can get a single scoop for $3.  I love ice cream but sometimes I just don't feel like eating a giant portion, especially if I'm getting dessert after a meal. It would also be the perfect amount for a kid! And if you want a more normal sized serving, two scoops is only $4.50, which is about typical for premium ice cream.

From reading reviews I now know that they offer regular sugar cones as well, but it seemed like everyone was getting a freshly made waffle cone. The smell certainly is tempting! You can also get ice cream sandwiched in a brioche bun.

They rotate their flavors pretty often based on what is in season, and they seem to usually offer a sorbet or two for the vegans. You can always check their website to see what they are currently scooping, but I'm sure you couldn't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Millie's on one of the first warm Saturday nights of the season and weren't sure what to think when we saw a line going out the door. Should we go somewhere else? How long would we wait if we stayed? We decided to get in line and it moved very quickly. The employees inside were super efficient in keeping things moving. Once we got near the door we were greeted by the sweet smell of Millie's freshly made waffle cones. It smelled so delicious. I opted for the Thai tea flavor in a junior size ($4) which is one scoop and a waffle cone (+$1). The Thai tea tastes just like the real thing from my favorite Thai restaurants. The perfect blend of tea flavor and milky sweetness. They also put a few mini marshmallows at the bottom of the cone that melt and make for a delicious last bite."}
{"text":"Some good flavors. The waffle cones that they make in front of the customers are a hit, and only $1 extra. Generous scoop sizes. Enough space to sit inside and a couple picnic tables outside as well weather permitting."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Millie's yet you haven't tasted the most amazing icecream ever. Yeah yeah a pint of whatever's in the freezer isle is good but where else will you have Thai iced cream! The test of good icecream are flavors like chocolate and vanilla. And this place has vanilla on lock. 

I get it you're not a dairy person their sorbet? is also divine. Oh you like dairy it just doesn't like you? That's what the lactaid is for! They have that too!"}
{"text":"I came back and as before, always good. This place is definitively my favorite in Pittsburgh for ice-cream. The waffle cone is amazing and every flavor is very tasty. A must try."}
{"text":"My Mint ice cream was absolutely repulsive. The \"hot fudge\" froze ontop of my icecream and to top it off the sprinkles were gross as well. So dissapointed."}
{"text":"The waffle cones alone are worth a visit. Add rich, homemade ice cream scooped by a friendly member of their staff and it's a home run. Don't be put off if there's a line - it'll move fairly quickly.  Limited indoor and outdoor seating. The neighborhood is busy so I usually park on Carron or Emerson."}
{"text":"One word - fantastic! How will I ever eat breyers again? You can tell it's homemade with real ingredients and the prices are fabulous! Highly recommend the strawberry. The portions are large and it's on a popular street. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We never go to Millie's for some out of the box creative ice cream, they have the classics covered well enough. Try either their chads vanilla or their Vietnamese coffee and you'll be happy. Their waffle cones are some of the best and freshest I have had. 

Very casual, in a great section of town for a nighttime stroll or chill on their picnic tables outside. Summer hot spot but great to grab in the winter with no line."}
{"text":"A great find on busy highland!
First off, the parking is just one of those things you learn to deal with in shadyside, Oakland, strip.. Anywhere cool has a price.
The good news is you can usually find a spot in the chipotle parking area or down below in whole foods area.
The building is a super cool remodel of an old row house with a very cool back deck.
It's only been open a week so it's still in the set-up phase, but its not an issue.
Now for the serious stuff... The ice cream!!!
Wow! The flavors and the cool pairings are amazing. They are happy to let you try all of their flavors, so take your time or do what I did, try a few! I had the coconut and lime sorbet and a a banana rum! Both were exceptional
My wife hand the ricotta with dried cherries, but she dried the dried fig and said it was very good too!
Can't wait to try them all!!"}
{"text":"Their ice cream is delicious and they have such creative flavors! I highly recommend the Vietnamese Iced Coffee or Dulce De Leche, if you have a big sweet tooth. I also recommend the Kulfi, which honestly tastes close to authentic Indian kulfi. 

I recently discovered that you get the best bang for your buck if you get a small size in a dish, which comes with 2 free toppings. You honestly get more ice cream in the dish than you would when ordering a small in a cone, plus free toppings!

It's also conveniently located next to Noodlehead, so it's a popular option for dessert after a dinner date! I've been here many times and will continue to come as long as I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I live out of town, but every time I visit my boyfriend here in Pittsburgh we HAVE to go to Millie's. Each time I've been there's been a line out the door - but for good reason! It moves quickly and trust me, the ice cream is absolutely worth the wait. I love that there always seem to be new flavors each time I visit (once a month or so), with a couple of regulars always on hand. They also have sorbet if you're not into the rich ice cream. And the waffle cones...man oh man...made fresh behind the counter, and so crispy and buttery. If I lived in town, I'd be there every day. This is ice cream done right."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new locally made ice cream shop opening in this location. When I went for the first time with two friends, we were excited to try every flavor. But you know, common decency forbids trying every flavor. Well, the friendly ice cream scoopers offered - without us asking - to scoop us a sample of every flavor. While we didn't take them up on it, I was instantly in love. The spiced rum & banana, the pear sorbet and the ricotta/pistachio/cherry were amazing surprises. I am SO enthusiastic to come back and try every other flavor I missed on the first go-round. Oh and I didn't mention the smell of fresh caramelized waffles that hits you when you enter. This is going to easily be my new favorite scoop shop in the 'Burgh. Make sure you come by and hang with the wonderful scoopers - they gave us great tips on flavors, and offered us a wonderful place to enjoy our tasty treat!"}
{"text":"This place is a chic, neat and trendy ice cream shop on the East End... Prices are cheap and the place is beautiful inside.. The staff are very friendly as well... Nice outside seating. I got the brioche which was different but was pretty good... Girl got a waffle cone that she enjoyed.. I will def go back!"}
{"text":"I went for the Vietnamese Coffee and was not disappointed. They were out of waffle cones by the time I got there but the sugar cones were fine."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday evening when it was 72° , and boy the line was long. The lavender and Vietnamese Coffee were the best ice cream flavors I'd had in some time. The fact that this is only a few minutes away from my home makes it that much harder to not visit again. And again!"}
{"text":"Outside of snakebit Jeni's Ice Cream of Columbus, Ohio, Millie's offers just about the best ice cream you're likely to find in about an eight-hour radius.

A \"whole other level\" is a pretty dumb phrase to use to describe food, but how do you distinguish A-plus ice cream from solid-A or A-minus ice cream?  There just ain't that many food descriptors for ice cream outside of creaminess and depth and richness of flavor.  But unless your taste buds and \"mouth feel\" receptors are busted, you'll recognize as soon as you spoon Millie's stuff into your mouth that it's on a \"whole other level\" from just about 95 percent of the ice cream you normally consume.  

Millie's sharp, white-tiled little Shadyside shop is charming, bright, and airy.  The staff on duty was as pleasant as they could be, and very willing to offer sample tastes of whichever flavor might catch your eye.  I went with the Vietnamese Coffee, which I gather is a popular one.  As an avid consumer of both the Vietnamese café sua da and of coffee ice cream, I didn't recognize that the flavor was especially that of Vietnamese coffee, but it was for damn sure a \"whole other level\" coffee ice cream.  

Only drawback on this day:  The shop was playing some modern Broadway show-tune dreck that was so ebullient and saccharine as to be ghastly.  Unfortunately, it was so hot on this day outside (this was back in August) that our ice cream would have quickly turned into just cream  if we'd fled the scene.  

While I was eating it, though, Millie's superb ice cream had the magic power to silence that music in my mind.  It's that good."}
{"text":"One of the best ice cream joints in town! As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with the lovely smell of fresh made waffle cones. They have their rotating lineup of fairly unique flavors but because I'm on the boring side, I'd only gone with chocolate, and once vietnamese coffee. They're also not shy with the serving size. I almost always immediately regret getting two large scoops instead of one. However, pricing is still kept reasonable imo."}
{"text":"BEST ICE CREAM I'VE EVER HAD! Hands down! I went with the chocolate flavor which is so rich, as well as the lavender which is my new obsession!! I ordered it for delivery through postmates so i could enjoy it while watching The Bachelor finale. They came in cute little cups, and I love that it's homemade!! Definitely come here if you are looking for the best ice cream in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Hi! This is my new favorite ice cream shop in Pittsburgh! I've been dying to try this place and finally....I was able to make my way over to Shadyside to try this place out. The shop is open from Sun-Thurs 12pm-10pm and Fri-Sat 12pm-10pm. We were there at 8:00pm - the store was busy, but the line moves quick. There's enough inside seating and plenty of picnic tables outside for when it is warm. 

There are so many amazing flavors to choose from - you can also get waffle cones or have the ice cream in a cup. 

For my first experience, I ordered Chad's Vanilla and the Peach flavor - this ice cream is out of this world. It is some of the best ice cream that I've ever had. I'm telling all my friends.

I'm ready to plan my second trip - grab some pints and stay tuned for the new Millie's ice cream truck - hopefully coming soon!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable ice cream place with so many different flavors to try. I had the salted caramel and it was great. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"Love that they use local jersey cow milk and pay so much attention to the quality of ingredients that they use. This is the only place in Pittsburgh where I will go out for ice cream. Normally ice cream gives me stomach aches but this doesn't - speaks to the quality."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and tried a lot of different flavors all of which were pretty good, texture is not as smooth for some. Only giving this a 4 and not a 5 because I'm not a fan of the waffle cones here, the last time I got it the cone was so sweet that the flavor of the ice cream was a little dull. Price and size are like most other ice cream places."}
{"text":"So. Freakin. Good. 

I am writing this while standing in the store. The place is super cute! It has a balcony attached which makes it that much bigger. 

They got rid of the creepy two way bathroom door that Oh Yea had. And it is super clean! 

The ice cream is so good! And the warm waffle cones melt in your mouth. The owner who worked the register was so sweet. 

There was a long line but it was totally worth the wait! I loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing!! I can't have dairy and they had 3 vegan options! I had the golden milk ice cream (contains honey) which was amazing! They also had a delicious chocolate ice cream that I tried and will have to get next time. My boyfriend had Vietnamese coffee (dairy-full) and said it was amazing. Neither of us generally get a cone but this was well worth it. The handmade waffle cones both smelled and tasted amazing! Great for dairy and non-dairy lovers alike. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Plus it's by noodlehead so it's a win/win."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but I am going to join the dissenting minority. This ice cream is not great.

I ordered a junior dark chocolate ice cream dish ($3.21 w tax), which is a single scoop. Floats were $7-$9, and I think waffle cones were $6, which is WAY more than Dave and Andy's. I get that rent on South Highland is probably terrible but wow. And unfortunately, the ice cream quality was more than not great.  My single scoop had so much sugar that you could see it. I was so sick of the scoop halfway through because it just tasted like pure sugar.  The consistency is also very icy and not creamy, which is not my thing.

The store is cute, the menu is simple, and the staff is nice.  There is both outdoor and indoor seating, and the interior is clean.

The waffle cones looked really good, but at this price and quality, I will stick to Dave and Andy's."}
{"text":"Millie's is one of the greatest ice cream places in Pittsburgh. The place has a bright, homey, and welcoming decor, which is only emphasized by the homemade ice cream. The quality of the custard here is top notch, and each flavor's ingredients are explicitly listed so you'll know what you're eating. In my opinion, the waffle cones here do not match up to the ones at Dave & Andy's but the ice cream at Millie's is superior. My squad had \"The Best Hot Chocolate,\" \"Salted Caramel,\" and \"Mint Chocolate.\" All fantastic, the but chocolate was the most notable. My only critique was that the Mint Chocolate was not as frozen as the other flavors, and was too wet. Check my photos.

Seriously, Millie's is located among other great Pittsburgh eateries. Finish up your meal, and don't forget to stop by this Grade-A establishment for a summery dessert. If you're not eating a meal but want an excuse for something sweet, go here. Actually, just go here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Stopped and grabbed the Vietnamese coffee and mint flavors which were some the best my wife and I have had. They had a very natural homemade flavor which is hard to find nowadays, not too sweet and accurate to what they're mimicking. Our only complaint was the ice cream was almost not cold enough and started melting almost immediately even on a cold drizzly day. The texture while rich was not the creamiest nor did it had live that slightly chewy texture you find in certain ice cream parlors like Tofts or Eric's Irresistable Ice Cream in Ohio. Overall though my wife and I really like this place and plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday after a lunch at Noodlehead. The decor is very classic ice cream parlor - perhaps a tad overwhelming.

There are not many flavors, but they are interesting ones! They let me taste as many as I wanted. I settled on spiced rum and banana and dried fig. At $4, two scoops is definitely worth it (a single scoop is $3).

The rum flavor was very much overpowered by the banana, but I still enjoyed it. The dried fig flavor was spot. on. 

I should say that I don't eat ice cream often. Why? I am lactose intolerant, and ice cream makes me unpleasant to be around. However, Millie's saved the day for me: they have single servings of lactaid pills for 50 cents each. Hurray!"}
{"text":"Millie's got that soft and goodness ice cream.  I love their vietnamese coffee flavor and since it's always on the menu, I will be coming back for more.  Other notable mention is the salted caramel (real salty).  Their other flavors looked interested, but when I tasted it - it was mostly sweet and the flavor wasn't bursting (olive oil, chestnut, etc.) but I will be interested to see the next batch of flavors."}
{"text":"..how in the world did I totally skip writing this review? I have been to Millie's twice. The first time was so good, that I made sure to bring back my bf the same week! This happened in the summer but I do remember that I ordered their mint flavor as well as the best chocolate in a waffle cone. I cant remember what I ordered the second time sorry.. both flavors tasted fresh and were delicious!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream in the Pittsburgh metro, in my humble opinion. The place smells heavenly as they're constantly making the waffle cones right there on site. One problem - if it's busy and the cones freshly made, they're still warm, and you know what that means...we experienced this problem on one recent trip and had to rush down our cones before everything melted away. On a more recent visit, on a busier night, they had planned appropriately and had plenty of fresh but cooled down cones ready to go, so I guess it depends on time of day and perhaps who's working. The flavors change regularly and some are quite inventive and unique, which adds to the charm and experience. There's indoor and outdoor seating and the space is clean and well lit. All in all, the place to go when in the 'Burgh for great ice cream."}
{"text":"I taste-tested two of the unusual flavors, including the Vietnamese coffee that many people love, but we ended up ordering typical strawberry amd chocolate. The ice cream tasted good but not special. I would have preferred that the cones not have a cinnamon flavor to them."}
{"text":"I've been getting way behind on reviews lately, but Millie's is a great place to start catching up with writing them.

I visited Millie's about a week ago with a friend.  Having heard it was the cool new ice cream shop in town, I suggested that we check it out, given that my friend and I are both diehard ice cream aficionados.  As usual, my friend was game, so we headed over to Highland Ave. to check out the goods.

After sampling some other flavors, I decided to go with scoops of the peanut butter and dark chocolate on brioche ($7), and my friend decided to get the salted caramel and \"the best\" dark chocolate in a bowl ($4).  The brioche was much larger than expected, and came toasted from the panini press.  Its warmth made for a nice contrast to the cold ice cream, and its lightness and sweetness complemented the ice cream nicely.  While I wouldn't get it every time I get ice cream, it was something interesting and different and made for a nice extra treat.

As for the ice cream itself, it was delectable and clearly high-quality.  Its texture was smooth and its flavors were delicious, with detectable bits of chocolate and caramel.  My only complaint is that \"the best\" chocolate melted rather quickly, suggesting that it wasn't frozen at a cold enough temperature.  The flavors were creative, and ranged from the classic (dark chocolate, peanut butter) to the unusual (orange poppy seed).

Needless to say, my friend and I are fans.  Although she's leaving town and won't be back until mid-July, I can say for sure that I'll be back for more as the weather warms up!"}
{"text":"AMAZING ice cream!  The best I have had in Pittsburgh.   The second you walk inside it smells like absolute heaven.  The ice cream is very creamy like Gelato but not so heavy.  My favorite is the salted caramel ice cream in their home-made waffle cone.  Bonus, the waffle cone has mini marshmallows in the bottom.  Genius!  I am a little worried that this place is going to make me fat because I live so close and I can't stay away!"}
{"text":"Locally sourced and made ice cream always end up tasting better somehow, but it's the availability of all the rotating interesting flavors that keeps us coming back. For example, I know of nowhere else that has Vietnamese coffee ice cream, and it is definitely one of the best flavors they have, with a much stronger roast flavor than traditional coffee but also traced with condensed milk throughout. You can be more adventurous and try flavors like fig or spiced prune, which may not sound appetizing as ice cream but they really make it tasty and unique. They usually have some sorbets as well, whose textures are creamier than sorbets elsewhere and are pretty close to ice cream. A delicious tropical one is the coconut lime, which is light but zesty."}
{"text":"Millie's is one of my favourite ice cream spots! The ambience here is so nice, friendly and extremely well lit! The lines are long in the summer nights but it's worth it. Also it helps that they have water fountains and move everyone through efficiently! I loved their Vietnamese coffee and the dolche con leche. However, some of the new flavors taste really similar, so it might be nicer to add some more variety moving forward"}
{"text":"I LOVE Millie's! The ice cream is fantastic, the aesthetic is so pleasing, and it's so clean and cute. Whenever we eat at noodlehead this is always our dessert stop! Viatnemese Coffee & Dolce De Leche are my favorites!"}
{"text":"So good I have nothing bad to say about this adorable little ice cream shop. They have plenty of unique flavors like lavender and prune. I loved their chocolate ice cream and I'm not usually a chocolate kind of girl but this was great  it was so rich and smooth. The waffle cone was really yummy."}
{"text":"My first time at Millie's. I had a waffle cone with salted caramel and almond butter ice cream. It was pretty good. The flavors are great and rich. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Their handmade ice cream and sorbets are delicious. I especially love their white peach sorbet. The fresh peach flavor is insane. The coconut lime is amazing as well. As for the ice cream flavors go, most of them are incredible, but some are a bit weird like Szechuan peach. The huge handmade waffle cones pack a ton of flavor. I love their ice cream and I will keep on returning for more."}
{"text":"The best time to try an ice cream place you have never been to before is on a freakishly warm April afternoon. There was not a huge line like I was expecting, and I was happy about that. Many people were sitting outside in the front and in the back on the patio. A very bright atmosphere, with the menu in big writing immediately above your head, I was hoping for something more kitschy. 

I tried the Lavender flavor before I made my decision, but I think it would have been too strong for me in the long run, so I decided to just try the chocolate. I figured with all the wonderful things I had heard, that the chocolate would still blow me away just as much as a fig or other strange flavor would. 

It was expensive, I spent over $8 there on two cones with a junior scoop in it each. I took a bite and alas, incredibly ordinary. It was good, and had a nice chocolate flavor, but it did not blow me away like I thought it would. Maybe I hyped it up too much. I like ice cream that is creamy like Coldstone, and I was really hoping for varieties with chunks of something in them. I am interested in the odd flavors, but when push comes to shove I would take a knock-out vanilla or rocky road over lavender any day. And if I wanted a strange flavor, I believe Razzy Fresh wins that award with their Taro flavored frozen yogurt. 

One thing that WAS incredible was their waffle cone. I have actually never had a better waffle cone in my life. Somehow, crunchy and chewy at the same time, I would go back just to experience the cone."}
{"text":"It is really good, I don't think anyone should miss it. Pistachio rose flavor is fantastic, and the flavors are always up to season."}
{"text":"By far the best ice cream in town. I've never had a flavor I didn't like. My fiancé works next door so we visit often. Today I was in and they were busy as normal. We were visiting because they had a few new flavors. We asked to try a few before ordering our cones. Upon the request, the manager, Dana, visibly rolled her eyes at me twice.  I've met the owner before and he was beyond friendly, I can't believe this is how he wants his business represented.  Her job is to deal with customers and she failed. Upon leaving my fiancé informed me that Dana always gets an attitude when you ask to sample a flavor. This is unacceptable from anyone who deals with customers but especially a manager. Again the owner is awesome and so is the ice cream"}
{"text":"I've gone to Mille's a couple times now and have tried some awesome ice cream flavors both times. The first time I came here it was a few days after it had opened. I was worried it would be packed, but it was later at night, so it wasn't bad at all. Since it wasn't super crowded they made our waffle cones for us on the spot, which was awesome. It did take a few minutes, but it was worth the wait. The cones came out a little warm and soft like a waffle, which was unique and awesome! I had the dark chocolate and salted caramel flavors, while my boyfriend had chocolate and vanilla. He said it was the best vanilla he's ever had. I preferred the regular chocolate over the dark chocolate, but it was still good. The salted caramel was good as well. 

The next time we visited it was much more packed and the cones were pre-made so they weren't warm and soft, which was a tiny bit disappointing, but they were still good. I wouldn't expect them to be able to make them as they go when there's a line out the door. I got lavender, which was amazing! I sampled the thai iced tea, which was interesting but not for me. And my boyfriend sampled the Vietnamese coffee, which was awesome!

I saw some customers complaining about the scoop size in their reviews here, but I felt like it was an ok size for handmade ice cream. I usually get a regular cone so I can have 2 flavors and it's more than enough ice cream. 

We will definitely be back many times!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad night because all of the reviews are so good except for mine. We waited in line to get half melted, odd tasting ice cream. I'm surprised they even let us pay for the bowl of milk soup. They seemed busy and stressed so I just paid and left. I don't know if I would try again since it was already an expensive mistake."}
{"text":"THE BEST! 

All natural ingredients. Fantastic and unique flavors. Great atmosphere. My husband and I can't get enough. We probably go here once a week (it's thrown a wrench in our summer dieting plans :) 

Because Millie's is all natural, when they create a flavor, IT ACTUALLY TASTE LIKE THAT FLAVOR. Imagine: Peppermint Brownie, Lavender, Goat's Milk Blueberry, Coco Nut Lime, Strawberry Rhubarb. ALL made from real ingredients. Not some fake artificial non-scene that we have come to accept as normal.  

But don't get scared away by the exotic flavors. Chad's Vanilla is possibly the best vanilla I've ever tasted. There is always a good Caramel, Chocolate, and Peanut Butter option to choose from as well.  

Hands down the best. So happy Millie's is here!!!"}
{"text":"I came in at the perfect time. There was no line and no one behind me so I got to try a few samples without holding anyone up. They have some \"funky\" flavors like olive oil, spiced prune and black molasses. They do change their flavors out and have a suggestion box. I ended up going with Vietnamese coffee. It was light and just the perfect amount of coffee flavor. Not too sweet and the junior size was a perfect portion."}
{"text":"Lavender and almond ice cream = perfection. I love Millie's. Unique flavors and quality ice cream what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Upon walking into Millie's, your decision to go has already been affirmed. The smells alone, which are free, tell you that you've made the best decision of your week by opting for Millie's ice cream. 
I like ice cream. I eat it frequently. But Millie's is a whole new ice cream ballgame. The cones are freshly made with homemade batter. So fresh that the owner was making the batter between servings, and each cone is made to order. They are slightly buttery, warm...heaven on earth, if you will. 
I had the salted caramel ice cream. It was perfection. It was not overly sweet and achieved the deep, burnt, salty caramel taste that I'm looking for in my life. 
If you haven't gone to Millie's yet, you are surely missing out."}
{"text":"This place has the strangest flavors of ice cream. I prefer fruit flavors, which were difficult to find. Eventually I got the chocolate and lavender flavors which were decent enough."}
{"text":"Good lord. This place was perhaps the best ice cream that I've ever had, and my family all felt like the prices were *too low* (they could've raised everything by a buck or two and no one would complain). The rose ice cream was phenomenal. Unreal place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They are very friendly, service is fast and the ice cream is magnificent!"}
{"text":"Line out the door went quick. The server allowed us samples and the flavors were rich and creamy. I chose peppermint brownie and Vietnamese coffee in a cone. Yum! Best cone I've had. Cool wallpaper and hipster vibe inside. A little pricey. Good overall."}
{"text":"Lots of yummy flavors and a fun atmosphere for a scoop - seating inside and outside in nice weather."}
{"text":"Best Ice Cream Ever! Chad, Lauren, Andrea & To do an amazing job using the finest and  freshest ingredients in their homemade ice cream. Make sure you try the gelato and brioche my favorite is with ricotta ice cream."}
{"text":"I've visited Millie's many times and I am never, ever disappointed. A few days ago I ordered the gingerbread ice cream in a waffle cone and it compelled me to happily hand over 5 stars. 

This place is great because they let you try any and all of the flavors -- which you'll need to do because: 1) the pressure to pick \"the one\" (or two..?) is something you don't want to screw up and 2) the flavor combinations are sometimes bizarre until you try them and you're like omghowisthisnotalreadyaflavor. 

I urge you to stand in the line no matter how long it is because it is worth it. On top of that, thanks for showing love to the lactose intolerant (you can purchase lactaid pills) and for making a self-serving water station easily accessible. The staff is always helpful and in \"all hands on deck mode.\"

And a very cute note: I used the restroom and there is a coat hanger for adults and then one low enough for children. (Awwwww.)"}
{"text":"I made the terrible life decision of trying Millie's ice cream shop four weeks ago and have been back another two times since then!

My husband and I love having dinner at nearby Dinette, and I think we've unofficially added Millie's cold and creamy treats to our routine. Parking can be tricky immediately on Highland Ave, so eating dinner at Dinette first and parking in their lot is actually quite convenient. 

I have particularly enjoyed some of Millie's more innovative flavors, including the White Chocolate and Rhubarb Jam and the Pistachio Honey. The Best Chocolate is also a delicious option and is very rich and flavorful.

Unfortunately, though the waffle cones in theory should be amazing, they've been so warm the two times that I've ordered them that my ice cream begins to melt immediately upon contact. Even though they're tasty, I won't be ordering one again due to the melting affect. 

In the summer on the weekend, the line either piles up outside the front door or wraps around the shop. I think Millie's could make some logistical or training changes to make the checkout process more efficient and to not turn away customers."}
{"text":"We are hard to impress, and we are small batch, homemade ice cream snobs. I got rhubarb crisp and my husband tried the Vietnamese coffee but settled on white chocolate rhubarb. Wish fig hadn't been out... wanted that too! So good... was the perfect ending to the spicy noodles we had next door!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Millie's that hasn't already been said? This is one of the latest trendy ice cream shops in Pittsburgh...the constant line out the door was our first indication of how beloved this place already is. Although there was a line, it moved fairly quickly, and the friendly employees were passing out samples of chocolate to people as they waited (smart move...sugar is a surefire way to stave off any restless crowd impatience!)

When we finally made it inside, it was like walking into a cheerful, bright, happy cloud. Bubblegum pink striped walls, white faux-subway tile on the walls behind the counter, colorful murals....the decor of this shop immediately makes you remember the pure, simple, child-like joy that eating an ice cream cone can bring.

Speaking of the ice cream, Millie's niche is homemade, natural ice cream in artisan flavors (a subset of which change regularly). The employees are happy to let you sample whatever you like before you make your selection. My husband and I both got the smallest size (junior, one scoop). We chose seasonal flavors, me the blueberry graham cracker in a cup, and him the peach in a sugar cone.

One bite of Millie's and it's evident that where they excel in the ice cream world is flavor. Both of our scoops were bursting with real fruit...no fake frankenflavors here. So fresh and pure. While the flavor of the ice cream is amazing, I must admit that the texture is not my favorite. The ice cream was more on the icy side than the creamy side. I'm no ice cream scientist (though I don't know why I didn't pursue that career path!), but I'd imagine that stabilizers and all of the other artificial things manufacturers add to ice cream probably help create that \"perfect\" creamy texture and silky mouthfeel that we're all used to. Because Millie's doesn't use any of these unnatural ingredients (which is great), texture likely suffers a bit as a result. No matter though. Their incredible flavors, friendly service, and unique offerings will have me coming back often to slurp up my frozen sugar happiness."}
{"text":"Oh, I *love* Millie's.They have the best home made ice cream in Pittsburgh. Eating \"Chad's Vanilla\" became my weekly reward after finishing a three-mile loop that I take to get to the place. I love the wonderful waffle smell. I take my time with the ice-cream and always get nervous when eating in a waffle cone. Instead, I just get broken waffle bits as a topping on my ice-cream.  I try to find places like Millie's in the other cities I visit, but I can never find creamier and nicer ice creams anywhere else. Their scoops are huge. I always get a junior size (single scoop) and struggle to finish it. They are very nice and welcoming. It can get crowded during summers. I go to Millie's even if during sub-zero Pittsburgh winters.

They have tons of flavors. But I almost always get Chad's vanilla which is unlike every other vanilla I have had. I would give this place 6 stars if I can."}
{"text":"First time around in the winter I got a white chocolate beet flavor and it was great. Second time I went in the summer I got the strawberry rose water and it was even greater.

Once we ate indoors, once we ate outdoors. Pleasant place."}
{"text":"Millie's had the best Chocolate ice cream I have ever tasted! It was like eating a chocolate candy bar. The waffle cone was delicious! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yum! I loved the flavors of ice cream! It was so hard to choose! I ended up with the Vietnamese coffee based on reviews and my tastebuds. It was so creamy and rich so i did just end up with a small size. This is a great representation of where Pittsburgh is going! This is on par with Bi-Rite creamery in SF!"}
{"text":"Adorable little ice cream shop with so many unique and delicious flavors to choose from. Perfect hangout place for a hot day."}
{"text":"I just recently moved away from Pittsburgh and this is about the only thing I REALLY MISS!  This is the best ice cream I've ever had!  I discovered it when I wandered into their soft opening by accident and struck at gold in the form of a fabulous ice cream cone - flavor ricotta and berry?!  So good!  The second time I went was on Easter when it was closed and there were at least 3 other couples that also stood disappointed in front of its closed doors.  Since then I have taken every chance to go there!  The flavors change frequently and there are always a few unique ones. 

My recommendation - get some noodlehead next door for dinner and end the night with Millie's!"}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say. 
Unique & interesting flavors and unique ways of serving up good homemade ice cream.
The perfect way to end an evening."}
{"text":"I'd suggest making a trip here, I live in the city of Pittsburgh and we still go every couple weeks!  
If you'd ask me what I like, I'd have to say lavender.. So give that a try! lol"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Millie's on a weekend night, you know it's crowded, and you know why. 

Millie's isn't just your standard ice cream place. They offer unique flavors that you can't get anywhere else, and even the typical flavors that are common have some sort of twist on it or are just plain amazing. One of my personal favorites here is the Vietnamese Coffee, which has the perfect amount of sweet and coffee blended together. The lavender is also really good, if you're going for something that's a little lighter.

Millie's is located near a bunch of other restaurants, so if you have room for dessert (which you always do), head over to treat yourself."}
{"text":"Was recently in Pittsburgh for a work trip and stopped by this great little shop after a dinner with local friends.  The super friendly owners Chad and Lauren were there there scoops in hand  and the ice cream was fantastic! I am not in Pittsburgh often but I will definitely stop back on here on my next visit."}
{"text":"Icy, but greasy mouthfeel. Generally disappointing. If the vanilla ice cream isn't good it means the ice cream base isn't good. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes. 

Best ice cream in Pittsburgh, hands down. However, it is the most expensive ice cream as well. I have had their packaged ice cream and never dreamed that a store would actually open in Pittsburgh. It is a dream come true. 

They have the most eclectic flavors and the best waffle cones (they have little marshmallows on the bottom). 

Beware: Lines out the door and wrap around to noodlehead."}
{"text":"I cannot pass up a cute ice cream boutique with unique flavors, I just cannot. Even after eating a giant fried chicken salad. Especially when the shop is as adorable as Millie's and features interesting high-end varieties (as well as some tried and true classics)! 

Though they had a lot of tempting options on display when I visited, i didn't think twice once I saw the strawberry rosewater flavor. Those are two of my all-time favorite flavors of anything, so combined I knew I just couldn't resist. I got it in a cup and ordered the waffle cone pieces as a topping - such a genius idea for those who don't want to commit to an entire huge waffle cone (though the freshly made cones smelled amazing and were hard to say no to). 

Ice cream is subjective, and personally I prefer a lighter, flavor-heavy kind vs. a super creamy rich kind, and this ice cream tended more toward Team Creamy. I wished I could taste a little bit more of the berry and rose flavors, but overall it was really well-made and of course tasty on a hot day. Browsing through all of the flavors listed at both of their locations (looks like they have different ones at their different stores) makes me wish I could come back on the daily and keep trying everything, but for now I'll have to just dream about another trip to Millie's until my next visit to PGH!"}
{"text":"Right next door to Noodlehead (5 star lunch spot btw), we stopped by really quick on a nice Friday afternoon. 

+1 Love the pink, rainbow/unicorn decor! It's like a trip to Dragontails or something...

TBH, ice cream flavors didn't astound me. The only one that stood out was salted caramel. Waffle cone was mediocre too...

Great spot for the little ones, but I've had better. Not a bad spot though, if you just craved ice cream!"}
{"text":"Usually love coming here but recently (specifically the downtown location) the ice cream has not been the same. I got 2 chocolate waffle cones last time and the ice cream was icy, not creamy as it usually is. The waffle cones were not crispy but soft and tasted burnt. I took the cones to go before I was able to say anything. Tried to call but with no resolution. I will still return but not as much as before. That experience turned my taste buds :("}
{"text":"Amazing!! First, the space: it is so beautiful, light and airy. Such a pleasant place to be in! Next the Icecream: just sublime. I had the Vietnamese Coffee flavor and the salted caramel. Both were delicious, although the coffee one was my favorite (so delicious!) My son had chocolate and left equally happy. Fresh waffle cones were divine too! So glad this place had opened, and just in time for summer!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today and loved it!  Great ice cream and service. 
The Concord Grape sorbet was AMAZING! The employee suggested a scoop of Peanut Butter and a scoop of Concord Grape sorbet to us - great recommendation.  
We had to leave with a pint of the Concord Grape - it's that good!!!!!
Although it's not close for us,  we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"unique flavors, excellent owners, prime location. nothing but great things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Found my happy place in this cute, clean and cheerful shop. 

Ordered a small pistachio rose and nectarine-ginger ice cream stuffed to the brim of a homemade waffle cone. Probably the most reasonably priced high quality artisanal ice cream I've had. Thank you, Millie's!"}
{"text":"Some of the best ice cream I have ever had. I love their simple layout and rotating flavors, although it is annoying sometimes when I come and they don't have the one I would like. I guess you can always check online to find their current flavors! It's location is great, near the bus stop and right next door to Noodlehead! It makes for a perfect dessert treat after a dinner out."}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream place in pgh! My go-to flavors are Vietnamese Coffee, Hazelnut and whenever they have it, the lavender. 

I'm lactose intolerant (but don't ever take that into consideration unfortunately) so I think it's nice that they sell lactaid for 50 cents at the counter. 

The decor is also really cute inside - lots of pink and there's a little counter that is reminiscent of old time-y ice cream parlours. 

I went here so often during my last year in Pittsburgh, easily every couple of weeks. It's relatively affordable but I probably was too frequent of a visitor."}
{"text":"This ice cream . . . 

5 stars. This is such a high quality product priced very well. I love to eat, and I have a sweet tooth to rival any person, but two scoops of this ice cream is where I wave the white flag! It's the perfect amount and only $4! 

This parlor has a very classic and enchanting vibe. It's boutique-ish. Smartly designed with bright colors to give you just the touch of whimsy you need when enjoy a cup or cone of ice cream! 

The flavors . . . varied and unique! You're not sure if you think Olive Oil would make a good ice cream flavor? Don't panic. Sample it. And while you're at it, sample any of the flavors your heart desires. Millie's is committed to your satisfaction. 

Here's a quality ice cream, priced right, great location, amazing store design . . . 

What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"In town just for the day to visit some museums, and decided on a snack before hitting the road. This area of Shadyside is tricky for parking - we ended up over the bridge and in a parking garage for PetsMart. But despite the hassle - the ice cream was amazing! Butter Pecan where the chunks of nuts are distinguishable and tasty, Lemon that is reminiscent of lemon meringue pie, and creamy vanilla - so much to love! Would definitely be back if in town again!"}
{"text":"Salted caramel gelato was really delicious--has a lot of salt flavor so watch out if you prefer regular caramel. We also tried the ricotta pistachio luxardo cherry, which seemed to have some orange zest in it as well (allergy sufferers, beware--it wasn't listed). I was disappointed that the ricotta flavor was quite mild, but the waffle cones were excellent and we'll definitely be back. Both concoctions could have benefited from a colder freezer--it was barely 50 degrees outside and we had soupy ice cream within a few minutes. 

Millie's also suffers from the same problem as the previous tenant--the shape of the shop is long and deep, and so the logical place for the counter means that people trying to leave have to walk through the line. The space would benefit from some stanchions or something similar to keep the line in check.

Bonus points for having plentiful tap water and selling Lactaid pills ($0.50 each)--genius!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Wish every neighborhood in the country has a Millie's!! I had the strawberry ice cream which was the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I love ice cream and Millie's is one of my favorite places to visit because the ice cream is made with the freshest all natural ingredients and has the rich creamy texture and slightly sweet taste I love! I was disappointed because I wanted to try the gingerbread flavor but it wasn't available so I tried the Salted Hazelnut and Butter Pecan.  The Salted Hazelnut had just a hint of salt and a generous amount of Hazelnut pieces.  I've never been a big fan of Butter Pecan ice cream that I've had elsewhere but Millie's won me over with there version. It was a smooth buttery Pecan delight!  I work downtown and can't wait for that location to open!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly and the space is quaint and cute. The flavors we chose were vanilla, vietnamese coffee, and coconut lime sorbet. The ice cream had great consistency and strong, quality flavor strength. As a nice quirky touch, they have a canister of lactaid capsules for sale atop the ice cream fridge."}
{"text":"We went to Millie's after dinner for a sweet treat. The line was out the door. That's a good sign. The wait wasn't long before we were inside and smelling waffle cones baking. You can taste any of the flavors. They are all made and served fresh. After reading the menu I knew what I wanted-no tasting needed. I wasn't sure I wanted a waffle cone so imagine how thrilled I was to find out one of the toppings is waffle cone pieces. It was perfect. I had a scoop of The Very Best and a scoop of Hazelnut. The chocolate was very good. It tasted like the fudge pops we are as a kid. I wasn't thrilled with the Hazelnut until I realized there were actual hazelnuts in the ice cream. The crunch from the nuts and waffle cone pieces were s great added touch. 
I love the whole pink theme. It's also nice that they have seating out front, inside, and in the back outside. I can't wait to bring friends to try it."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try Millie's, and the hype holds true! I started by trying the Vietnamese coffee, which was DELICIOUS. But unfortunately they didn't have enough for a scoop. In my distress, I opted for a scoop of pistachio and the best chocolate. This turned out to be a great backup plan. All of the flavors were smooth and creamy and a great way to end a long day. The only downsides were the long line and the limited options, but obviously this is a great problem to have!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I decided to stop in here after a dance class. I tried the lavender vanilla, coconut lime and lemon my favorite was the lemon so I got a lemon milkshake and so did my cousin. They were $7 each which is kinda pricey but it is good ice cream. My only complaint was the milkshake was so thin it almost had the same consistency as milk. Since they were so thin I thought they would be bigger but they were pretty small. Other than that I will definitely be back for the ice cream ."}
{"text":"If there's a line, wait, because it's that good! This is a cute little ice cream shop in the little South Highland Avenue business district part of Shadyside and just over a short bridge from East Liberty. Though very new, the owners have managed to give it a sense of tradition as well as fun. There is indoor seating and also some white picnic tables outside in the front. With the exception of some staples -- including the decadent chocolate, which is probably the best chocolate ice cream that I've ever had -- the flavors are constantly changing and there's always some interesting flavors. I've found that the creamy ice creams are better then the sherbets. A small size is two scoops and a regular is three, and you can mix and match the flavors for each scoop. Prices are reasonable given the quality of the ice cream."}
{"text":"Despite living a block away, it took the BF and I weeks to get here. It's a cute little place; not as 'against the establish' kind of stuff that was 'Oh Yeah' (i.e. I don't think they will be opening a BANK as well lol). Inside there is a large farm mural too which I found also very cute. 

The BF had the best chocolate and I had the salted caramel. You can definitely tell this is real deal homemade stuff; very rich and very creamy. The BF, as usual, was \"eh\" about the chocolate, the ice cream elitist that he is. We both agreed the salted caramel was way intense. I thought both were very good. I think he's more of a Dave & Andy's man. Either way, the real star of the show is the cone. They are fantastic! Soft and flavorful, with a delicious smell that beckons, \"Please come inside. Please order me.\"

It doesn't look like they are real big on mix-ins or anything, so this is not the place to go for a knock-off blizzard. But if you want a very good cup of ice cream I'd check it out. There is a bench outside, usually monopolized by hipsters smoking, but hopefully they'll get a few more tables or something; that would be very nice."}
{"text":"I know this is weird, and petty, but they wouldn't make me a sorbet shake. I've had sorbet shakes - I like them. I get it if they warn customers \"We don't usually...\" or something like that, because it's an odd request, but I like them, and it was annoying. I got a peanut butter shake instead, which was fine, but nothing amazing. You know what would've been more refreshing?... Sorbet shake."}
{"text":"Get the Salted Caramel. It is the greatest ice cream on Earth. Thanks for reading this PSA."}
{"text":"Get the 5 spice honey!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Millies several times and the Vietnamese Coffee lives up to the hype!  Be sure to get a freshly-made waffle cone.  Sometimes there's a line out the door but the wait is never too long"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ice cream! The wait can be out the door, but I promise it goes quick and is SO worth it. There is limited seating inside and is usually pretty busy, so we just got our orders and walked around Shadyside while enjoying them. I got a chocolate milkshake and it was perfect. My boyfriend got the white chocolate rhubarb ice cream on a waffle cone and he loved it. Parking can be tough around here, so beware."}
{"text":"Millie's Millie's Millie's.  What can I say about you?  You're perfect.  Let's get married.  
For real though...Chad has quite the business going on here.  My husband and I used to get ice cream from him out of his mobile cart in Highland Park and so happy to see that they've opened up shop.
Can't beat their waffle cones (with the surprise marshmallows in the bottom).  The East End was in need of a good ice cream (not gelato, not fro-yo) place and they filled that void."}
{"text":"I'm not giving Millie's 5 stars, as a Columbus, Ohio native, I am very loyal to Jeni's ice cream, a very similar alternative. I tried the Vietnamese Coffee at Millie's in a waffle cone, obviously (since I'm a sucker for waffles) and it was OK! The price was right for a specialty flavored ice cream shop and the portions were very generous, but the flavor didn't wow me like I was hoping. The staff was friendly and I would definitely go back, maybe try a different flavor next time! 

Sorry Pittsburgh, your Jeni's alternative isn't satisfying this Columbus girl's craving."}
{"text":"The bottom line is that Millie's ice cream is really, really, really good.  So good that, in the summer, at least 3 nights a week my boyfriend and I consider making the trek from Lawrenceville to Shadyside just for Millie's.

Millie's is housed in the former Oh Yeah! ice cream space. Unlike its predecessor, the ice cream is homemade (by Chad Townsend, former executive chef of Salt of the Earth). You can definitely tell the difference.

The decor and space are reminiscent of an old fashioned ice cream parlor, with scoop door handles, a logo the shade of pink that makes you think of the 50s, and some other vintage decor. Nevertheless there's a very clean, new feel to the space.

There is a constantly rotating collection of specialty flavors, along with some staples that seem to always be available (chocolate, vanilla, salted caramel).  Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee seem to be frequent repeats as well, though I'm not sure if that's a seasonal thing.

There is often a line outside the door.  They started offering pre-packed pints, though, and if you're just there to grab one of those, you can skip the line of flavor-tasters and head right to the cashier (pro tip).

Thank you, Millie's, for finally bringing Pittsburgh the delicious, high-quality local ice cream we have waited so long for!"}
{"text":"Well worth the line! There's a very small selection of flavors, but they're all unique, craveable flavor profiles. I had the almond fig froyo and I'm converted. Great taste, great vibes, great spot."}
{"text":"Simple yet exotic ingredients equals great tasting ice cream! Since my first visit, I've returned with family and solo on four separate occasions. The \"best chocolate\" ice cream is simply the best. We've tried the mango, salted caramel, Vietnamese coffee, and have many more to go. It's well worth the wait, the time spent search for parking, and the prices are comparable to the chain ice cream stores, but tastes better!"}
{"text":"Was looking for artisanal ice cream in the area and this hit the spot. The space is bright and clean. There is a small freezer where you can sample a flavor before ordering. Staff was friendly and allowed me to get 2 flavors for a junior size even though the sign indicated 1. 

I ordered lavender and thai tea, which were great together. If you've had actual thai tea, you know it is very strong and sweet, which is what I was expecting, but the flavor was much more subtle and just enough. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I first took a bite of the salted caramel, I thought it was cinnamon because I felt that spicy kick at the back of my throat. I spent the next three minutes tasting the other scoop trying to find the salted caramel taste. Turns out I mixed them up! Once I realized, the flavors shone through. The salted caramel was VERY salty and had a heavily burnt caramel taste, but I liked it nonetheless. The cinnamon was deliciously rich as well. I take it as a good sign when simple flavors are made right - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. 

Please go here. I got the roasted rose and strawberry ice cream. It is not super strong, but you can taste both the rose and strawberry and it is sooo good. I tried a bit of the Vietnamese coffee, next time I come, I'm going to try that one. 

I got mine in a normal sugar cone, but when you walk in, the place literally smells like waffle cones and it is actually amazing. You know you're getting good dessert when the whole place smells absolutely delicious. 

It seems like they change the flavors a lot, so I feel like there is really good variety here. I can't wait to come back and try more flavors!!"}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about this place. We went here after dinner and there was a line out the door. So at first I was like, eh....do we really want to stand in a line for icecream? Well the group I was with did so there we stood. I will say that the line moves very fast. So you do not have to wait around for long, which in my book is always a good thing. The menu is not huge but that makes choosing a flavor even harder because the choices are so few that you want to try all of them. My friend and I decided to share a two scooper bowl of icecream with some added toppings. It was just after dinner so, sharing is caring!

We got a really exciting choice of chocolate and vanilla. I know, I know, really risky choice there. We did try a few of the other flavors but nothing piqued our interest. So why not go with the old staple of chocolate and vanilla. We added toppings of crushed cone, nuts, the whipped cream, and then topped it off with some chocolate AND caramel sauce. I mean, if you are going big you go big. It was awesome. I loved every second of my half of the bowl. It was enough to share so that was a good thing because it was a little pricey even though it was good. I do not know if I would pay that much for myself, but splurging every once in a while is never a bad thing. 

There is also seating outside in the front that is just picnic tables that are really nice to sit at during a warm summer evening. We opted to just sit inside at the counter because it just seemed easier and less of a hassle and less crowded. Everyone wanted to sit outside so we just sat inside and got a seat right away. 

I enjoyed it here. I will probably come again and will probably share my dish. It was a fun little place to go to. The atmosphere is really upbeat and happy and the staff was ready to help out whenever they were asked a question or asked to try a flavor. I liked it! Try it out!"}
{"text":"I'm picky when someone tells me they know of a great homemade ice cream place. My friend whose a Pittsburgh native brought me here. The placed smelled of warm waffles and though I planned to get a waffle cone i was too full from my dinner so I ended up getting a chocolate milkshake. My friend got a waffle cone with lavender and coconut ice cream. That lavender was bomb! It smelled so delish and tasted absolutely milky, silky good! My milkshake was devine! The place is a absolutely must if you want some amazing ice cream! I love that they change flavors all the time also."}
{"text":"Neat little shop on S. Highland.
Creative flavors.
Everything is fresh and locally sourced.
Great texture and taste. 
The waffle cone was perfect...some crispness and a great texture...not to hard like most shops. 
Had the sweet ricotta with pistachio and cherries."}
{"text":"I got a cone with the Peppermint and the Vietnamese Coffee and both flavors were exceptional! Both really large scoop portions. The homemade waffle cone was a little thin and bland but the ice cream was incredible. I also tasted the Olive Oil Ice Cream which I did not suspect to be any good and was actually insanely delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has become an obsession. Whenever I'm in Shadyside, I make sure it's one of my manyyyyy stops. 

9 out of 10 times, there is a line out the door, but it is absolutely worth it! 

Staff is friendly and very patient when you can't decide which flavors you want! 

I've never tried a flavor I didn't like. I've had the vanilla, chocolate, Vietnamese Coffee, dulce de leche, and more recently since it is the season,  pumpkin. 

I am usually boring and just go with a scoop in a cup, but sometimes I feel adventurous and go with a cone. 

Everything is fresh and always tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"They serve some amazing Ice Cream here. When you walk in, you can smell the intense butter smell (some love this) and they make a mean waffle cone here. Like the waffle cones that bend when you bite into them because they are still warm. Top that with some Vietnamese Coffee Ice Cream and you are in heaven.

I'm not a big Ice Cream person, but I can eat that Vietnamese Coffee Ice Cream every day of the week."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into Millie's and smell the homemade scents wafting through the door, you'll know why this place is so sought after. With rotating flavors, Millie's has unique flavor options that you won't be able to find any where else! They even sell pints of ice cream to-go. Some of my favorites include the dulche du leche and lavender ice cream flavors. Their waffle cones are also hand prepared and rolled right in front of you!

If I'm not in the mood for a cone, I like to get a cup of ice cream with waffle crumbles sprinkled on top."}
{"text":"Pro: I really like the turnover of flavors here and the staff is really friendly as well as helpful. 

Con: The smell of sweet buttery waffle cones assaults you as you enter the shop to really get you in the mood for a decadent treat. When there's a long line, however, this powerful smell has made me so nauseated that I had to give up on my ice cream goals. 

I also find the ice cream to generally be way too sweet and would prefer the ice cream to be slightly more churned. 

Sometimes, after hanging out in Shadyside, I end up at Millie's for dessert for a lack of better options."}
{"text":"Funky spot. Great ice cream. Unique flavors. A little bit overpriced but an occasional stop for a family.  High quality ice cream and smells fabulous inside."}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviewers. My daughter and I were not impressed by this ice cream. It's icy like it has freezer burn. Some flavors were powerful but not in a good way. Her caramel ice cream was like a smack of caramel rather than an indulgence. We both prefer the creamy goodness of Dave & Andy's. We'd even choose Cold Stone over Millie's.

On the other hand, they did an awesome job on the remodel. The place is so much bigger now! And adorable! The decor won't be enough for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"The moment I saw this place on social media I knew it was going to be good! I suppose that's putting a lot of pressure on the ice cream to be as good as it looks in a tiny cropped photo on Instagram but it did not disappoint! 

I ordered the Butter Pecan on a waffle cone and LOVED it. The portion for a small was huge! My son got a small cup of vanilla and he went to town on it! I've never seen him eat so much ice cream (actually I took him to a chain ice cream shop recently and he barely touched his cup of vanilla). It all tasted so fresh and real! I'm eager to try some other flavors. 

And I really loved the decor! Every spot was picture perfect, from the cone on the stairs at the entry way to the mural behind the counter. The staff wore cute shirts that made it feel so old fashioned. For an ice cream shop it was pretty idyllic and sometimes you just need that little escape from reality!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while after hearing only positive things! My friend and I came on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy. The smell of fresh waffle cones wafting out the door was just decadent. I got a waffle cone with a scoop of strawberry and vietnamese coffee. The strawberry ice cream was so creamy and not too sweet. It did not have that artificial taste. The vietnamese coffee was also decadent with it not being too bitter. The waffle cone was also delicious. My only complaint was that the waffle cone was leaking through the bottom, which was not ideal. Overall, an excellent homemade ice cream place. I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok gang, this joint is so hip that it would be more accurate to refer to it as acetabulofemoral.  Boom! How's that for a physiology joke? Seriously, in a month or so when you hear that joke all over the place, you'll know where you heard it first.  Anyway, the ice cream is fantastic; probably the best coffee ice cream that I've ever had anywhere (Jeni's I'm looking in your direction.)  I have no idea how much it cost because I couldn't find pricing displayed anywhere (note: I was chasing toddlers so I might not have looked carefully enough) but I know it was great and it didn't cost that much.  Minus one star because it is in Pittsburgh; I promise to upgrade when the Browns win a Super Bowl and I can stop feeling inadequate."}
{"text":"Will start by saying it's a bit overpriced, but if you're looking for amazing ice cream in an even more amazing waffle cone, this is your place. I have never had such a yummy waffle cone! Parking is tough in this area of Shadyside as it's surrounded by some popular spots like Noodlehead and Mad Mex. Definitely worth a visit! I have seen some pretty long lines here when the weather is right or on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've been following this place since before they even had an actual shop (or 2). Every flavor is thoughtfully made and delicious. I get something different every time and am never disappointed. I believe my boyfriend got their first ever birthday cake also and it was custom made and great so 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Yes, it's just as good as everyone says it is. Not much more to add. The Vietnamese Coffee seems to be the most popular. My husband got it and I had a taste. It was even better than I expected. I had a waffle cone w/salted caramel and peach brown butter. Both flavors were more savory than sweet, which was perfect. I also love the interior design. It's a million times more brighter than Oh Yeah was. It has a very clean and inviting look to it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the hazelnut chocolate, which was absolutely delicious. They have a few staples, plus a few seasonal flavors, which are also very good. Extremely high quality using fresh ingredients!! Take a sample and try as many as you'd like."}
{"text":"Walking into Mille's I had the feeling of being in an modern day ice cream parlor. They have wooden benches where you can sit on a rainy or cold day as was the day of my visit or take out. You can also purchase pints to take home with you.

They have 12 different ice cream and sorbet offerings. You get to sample them on miniature plastic spoons unlike the throw away versions you get at other shoppes.  I was really impressed with that. The owner and manager told me that they are one of two ice cream stores that completely make their ice cream from scratch including pasteurization.

There standard favorites are rich chocolate and lemon sorbet. While I sampled both I was leaning more towards the dark chocolate which is my favorite type of chocolate and butter pecan. You can get your ice cream in either a waffle cone or up. Juniors start at $3.00, whereas small is $4.00 plus tax.  Yes you get two scoops with the small and you can select two different flavors for your scoops. So I ordered the dark chocolate and the butter pecan. They were both out of this world good!! 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They do have recycling in addition to your regular trash. The only setback is parking which tends to be a problem in that area but if you can park on a nearby side street during the day then you should not have too much trouble. 

I asked how often they change out the flavors and was told about every two weeks or so. But they will always have their standard favorites if you want them. Coffee is also available for purchase. This will be my new go to place whenever I'm in the East Liberty area again."}
{"text":"This place has a variety of delicious flavors from Vietnamese coffee to lemon to butter pecan or lavender! Some of their flavors are traditional, but some are a unique take on ice cream. The staff are super friendly and let you sample as many as you want! We came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy, but we tried to come the day before on Friday night and the line was out the door. They also offer lactaid packets for like 25 cents so everyone can enjoy :)

Ps: if you want to get 2 flavors but don't want 2 scoops, you can get 2 half scoops!"}
{"text":"The service, the quality of ice cream all just okay.  Nothing to be impressed by.

However, I do appreciate the simple menu and ease of ordering/checkout that many ice cream places lack.  

The ice cream flavors are interesting and sound great but I find the ice cream to be less creamy and more icy than I prefer."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was completely blown away by this ice cream! I told people afterwards how I'm always kind of *shrug* about getting ice cream - it's something people always want to do, but as a savory-lover myself, I never feel fulfilled afterwards. Wellllll I had quite the opposite experience at Millie's! As soon as you walk into the store, you smell the waffle cones's sugary scent and then your eyes notice a girl baking them behind the counter and then your mouth starts to water and you NEED a waffle cone that second. The pistachio honey special on the 4th of July was SO good, and I was relieved to see the girl scoop only one scoop in the cone because I feel like most places usually over do it on the ice cream and under-do the attention on the fact all you want is that waffle cone! Awesome place!! Will be back tonight :)"}
{"text":"Millie's is clean, has friendly employees, and of course awesomely yummy flavors of ice cream. Can't wait for the second location to open! And don't stop selling in stores..."}
{"text":"Easily the best ice cream I've had in Pittsburgh. I'd been dying to try this place since it opened, but was always deterred by the long lines. I snagged my chance to try it last Friday when there was surprisingly no line and I'm so glad I did! 

After sampling a few flavors, I decided on a scoop of strawberry rhubarb pie and a scoop of lemon. The strawberry rhubarb pie was absolutely AMAZING. It was perfectly creamy with fresh pieces of fruit and chunks of pie crust hidden in there. You can tell that they use really high quality ingredients for their ice cream. The lemon, while also very yummy, definitely was outshone by the strawberry rhubarb. 

Can't wait to come and try more delicious flavors!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was fantastic the service was excellent I highly recommend this place also check website for the ever changing flavors"}
{"text":"Overall, great ice cream and friendly staff. Loved the pistachio rose and the Thai iced tea (which was a little different from other places but still delicious)! I wasn't too impressed with the sorbet, but it may have just been the flavors that were on rotation today. Definitely check out this place if you're nearby - it's cute and delicious."}
{"text":"I tried their ice cream at the Bloomfield farmer market, ooh it was so delicious and refreshing. I've heard so many good things prior to trying, and let me tell you. Even though the selection at the farmers market was small, but both flavors I tried I really liked. I ended up getting both flavors - lavender ice cream and tangerine sorbet. I would love to go get the full experience at their shop soon. I will update my review once I do!"}
{"text":"Millie's knows how to do ice cream. Prepare yourself for a sugar rush because this is not for the faint of heart. Their ice cream is very heavy and rich in flavor so a couple spoonfuls will leave an average person more than satisfied. The line is always long and crawling out the door, but it gives me some extra time to decide which flavor I want - a decision not to be taken lightly. 

The waffle cone is deeeelicious! There really is no other acceptable way to eat ice cream than in a waffle cone. It takes the experience to another level. 

Let's talk ice cream!! The \"Best\" Chocolate has a darker taste to it. VERY sweet and rich. You'll feel like you're eating pure sugar - in the best way possible, of course. It's definitely one of my favorites. Being Vietnamese myself, I couldn't pass up the Vietnamese Coffee flavored ice cream. However, I was SO disappointed because it tasted like any generic coffee ice cream you can find in a store. If you're going to put \"Vietnamese\" on your product, I expect results! 

Overall, delicious ice cream! I will definitely be back again - probably more times than I'll be proud to admit."}
{"text":"My favorite flavors are the vanilla and the olive oil. I've had Millie's here at the actual location as well as at Wigle in whiskey-shake form.
Their ice cream is delicious. Truly like some of the best I've ever had. I'm also a big fan of the pistachio rose which is funny because typically I don't like pistachio anything.
It's a nice little walk from home on a spring/summer day for a cone or dish."}
{"text":"Went here for a treat on my husbands birthday. 

We tried a few flavors and I decided to get a waffle cone with salted caramel and Vietnamese coffee. The cone was delicious and smelled heavenly. The salted caramel ice cream was very creamy and had a wonderful and balanced flavor. I really liked it paired with the coffee flavor which would have been too strong for me on its own. 

I can't wait to go back to try more flavors."}
{"text":"After a spicy soup from next door at noodle head, this is must right afterwards!!

Second time here and ice cream is amazing every time!!"}
{"text":"I'm not much an ice cream fan but their chocolate ice cream in a waffle cone was actually quite enjoyable; their stuff tastes very fresh. The seating outside was nice and had fewer rambunctious children."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made my way to the actual store after buying pints around town. I'm addicted to their fig ice cream and grab a pint whenever I can. 

I am so boring, I usually just want my ice cream in a cup so I can enjoy the actual ice cream! I know that brioche ice cream sandwich does sound divine, so maybe someday I'll break from tradition.

I ordered the lemon ice cream and it was fabulous. Lemon can be tart or sweet, and this was on the creamy sweet side. I only got one scoop and immediately regretted not getting two, it was so good! I actually also regretted not taking a pint to go! Let this be a lesson, don't leave with regrets here, fully indulge!"}
{"text":"There's ice cream, and then there's Millie's. There's so much to love about their product and the business as a whole. Not only is their ice cream uniquely flavored (but also comforting -- seriously, try the lemon blackberry or the coffee), dreamily creamy, and a perfect pick-me-up after a long day -- they also support the community. I've had the privilege to meet Melissa and Chad at the community event where they provided ice cream and personally scooped and handed out the ice cream themselves. It felt great to support a local business, and have them support the community in turn. Thanks, Millie's!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for ice cream in Pittsburgh! Every single flavor is incredible!! And the homemade waffle cones!!"}
{"text":"First time tonight and blown away by the fresh homemade waffle cone! Will be back. Nice atmosphere with light and airy decor. Long line but it kept moving and it was worth it."}
{"text":"The first few times I came here I was underwhelmed. I found their ice cream had an excellent creamy texture, but I like ice cream that has a strong flavor, and their flavoring was a little too subtle. I was specifically unimpressed by the dulce de leche, which is normally one of my favorites. Nevertheless, I continued coming here, and some of their other flavors are really spot on!

The last time I came here they had a special flavor: yuzu meringue pie, which was absolutely delicious! Yuzu is an Asian citrus. I am often skeptical of citrus flavors, but this one was bright and summery while still have a smooth creamy texture. I also had the Vietnamese coffee, which I quite enjoyed (you can get multiple flavors in a scoop!). I love how the whole store smells like waffle cones, and you can watch the staff making them

This place is worth visiting, but choose your flavors wisely!"}
{"text":"Well I love lavender ice cream. Rhubarb is a new hot thing that takes the place of lemon but still gives the sweet with the tart. Both of which are fantastic, and the current featured flavored. I'll be interested to see how often the flavors will turn. 

Not to all, lines will increase as the night goes on. The smell of waffle cones is enough to make you smile. 

Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Creamy, flavorful ice cream with crunchy homemade waffle cones.  I tried the 'best chocolate' and dark chocolate ice creams.  Both were exceptional, but I preferred the sweetness of the best chocolate to the bittersweetness of the dark chocolate.  Staff was friendly and served everyone quickly despite a long line."}
{"text":"Chad and his wife, Lauren, make the best ice cream and sorbet. It is consistently creamy, smooth, and the flavors absolutely delicious and often, unique. We tried some of their more common flavors- salted caramel and chocolate, at a CSA event and signed up for the CSA based on our experiences there. We've since tried Concord grape sorbet, Mission Fig ice cream, and Apple cider sorbet and all of them have been absolutely delicious. Plus, what is more fun than top-notch ice cream delivered to your house?! Last but not least, it should be noted that Chad and Lauren are kind, down-to-earth people who take pride in providing a superior product. We've enjoyed tasting and eating their ice cream as a family and I'm already trying to convince my son that the Spring CSA would be an excellent birthday gift for him (and the rest of us!)"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! They keep changing their flavors, that's probably why reviews might vary depending on the flavors. 

For me so far, it's one of the best spots in Pittsburgh and totally worth a stop couple times a week while it's summertime. 

In general, if there is a smell of fresh hot waffles being made, I'm sold! That fragrance brings back lovely memories and starts a French folks symphony in my head. That's what exactly Millie's did to me. The pleasant awesome smell of fresh waffles can be detected from a block. Homemade ice cream especially the cantaloupe sorbet and rose pistachio are flavors I have never had before and they were just sublime!! Tried the rose pistachio twice and it was insanely tasty! I'm not a fan of cantaloupe! But, there was a guy offering flavors tasting at the entrance to make the long line move faster and he recommended the cantaloupe sorbet. Once you taste this cantaloupe sorbet, it's like an enormous burst of freshness in your mouth!! It was just perfect! Not too sweet, not too heavy, but at the same so refreshing and flavorful. 

My friends (from Pittsburgh and one visiting from NC) loved it too although they're not ice creams fans.. One insisted on going back next day. It added more credit to my foodie CV although my foodie board certification is uptodate and with honors. 

If you're visiting Pittsburgh, you totally should try this place. Parking is easy and available at a plaza close by (where Chipotle is). Also there is Adda coffee and Starbucks nearby if you (like me) feel like a cup of black coffee after a dessert like this."}
{"text":"Granted the snow in April was unexpected, I would have expected a larger scoop despite the cold. Perhaps a pint is where it's @."}
{"text":"BEST vegan chocolate ice cream I have ever had. Line can get pretty long but service is pretty fast, and the small wait is worth it. Great, unique, and creative flavors like Lavender, delicious waffle cones, and the Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich... Millie's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I. Love. Millie's. This is by far my favorite ice cream in the city, or anywhere really. I used to seek this ice cream out before they had a physical location and i couldn't have been happier to hear that they opened a place. The inside is so cute. Pink and white, a fireplace, and a cute mural on the wall. Every time I go there is literally a line out the door and I'm never upset about it. It's worth the wait! And the wait is never very long.

The staff is always so pleasant and let's you sample the many unique flavors. My favorites include the Vietnamese coffee and the best chocolate. Mmm. Mmm. I've also have a few ice cream cakes made by them and each one was so unique and delicious. 

Also, the smell of the homemade waffle cones as you walk through the door is incredible. If I could capture that smell and carry it with me I would."}
{"text":"Always interesting flavors. Like olive oil, lavender, 5 spice apricot- they change frequently. Delicious, quality ice cream. Buttery, perfect waffle cones and they have lactaid pills too!"}
{"text":"I walked past this place many times on my way to noodle head for lunch or dinner. Though, I found the decor interesting from outside, I never got a chance to actually taste their ice cream until today. 

After a tiring day, I treated myself with some fig and vanilla ice cream which was absolutely delicious. They have other interesting flavors too like lavender. I am sure I will try that next time I go there. 

If you are taking your car,  it is almost impossible to find parking on that street. Good luck with that!"}
