{"text":"Food is great! Try the flank steak, the fondue, the bruschetta's, really the whole menu is a can't miss! Also, not on the drink menu is a Suite 9...it's basically a muttled strawberry mojito, and is really really good! No other place has this!   By far a best of Madison!"}
{"text":"Went here with my sister to celebrate her new job back in mid-June. We started with the sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni flat bread, which was superb, but we had half of it boxed up (eaten for breakfast the next morning--mmm) because we wanted to try a few more dishes.  Next we tried the portobello ravioli--just fantastic.  Umami-licious, with a delectable sauce.  We also had the lamb, which was served on a jalape√±o polenta cake with mirapoix.  Just delicious.  So, in short, angel choirs were singing. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience!  My husband and I brought friends along in celebration of his birthday.  We had a phenomenal time. The food was exquisite and the service was outstanding.  We are making this a regular date-night spot!    If you are looking for a refreshing and different take on an evening out,  explore Eno Vino Wine Bar of Madison, WI... you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Everything was delish here! Been to this place few times, and I've got nothing to complain about.  The menu choices were extensive, quite creative and innovative. I love how they combined tastes of different cultures, and still maintain the best quality and tastes. My faves are the grilled kurobuta pork medallions, the cheese platter, steamed PEI mussels, and the chicken skewers.  I love the ambience, the wide selection of cocktails (great martinis) and wines, and the fact that I can order many different things in small portions (be careful, though, you may spend too much money that you intended to do). It's best to come to this place with big groups, that way you get to share things. But make sure to make reservations.  Eno Vino may be the best thing about living in Madison!"}
{"text":"I used to rave about Eno Vino to fellow foodies but I have officially taken it off my list of favorite restaurants. The past three times I've been there food has been sub par and way too much money to lack in quality.  It's the little things their kitchen staff is messing up on: burnt crab cakes, soggy flatbread, overcooked steak.  I never minded forking over the money before for this strip mall treasure but 3 consecutive fails! Never again. Sorry guys get your s*** together. In the meantime, just stick with cocktails at the bar and don't pay $21 for soggy flatbread. My $6 frozen pizza I had later that night was crispier. Madison has far too many fantastic restaurants to settle."}
{"text":"Ate here recently with friends. Great atmosphere and service. The food was delicious as were the cocktails and wine list. Will certainly return. This may be our new fav restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"This review is several months late. I was in Madison on business and was recommended to come here by some locals. The atmosphere was nice and food was extremely delicious. I enjoyed everything that we ordered and was definitely stuffed by the time I left. We ordered a little bit of everything and shared it amongst us all. I came with a small group of 3 other individuals. I enjoy tapas and this is ranked up there for me. I definitely recommend this place and would come back if I am in the area again. The atmosphere is really nice and the open kitchen layout adds to the presence."}
{"text":"I always have great service here, especially at the bar. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the servers/bartenders are great at making recommendations. Portions allow you to try multiple things. They also have a nice balance of trendy vs. traditional cocktails. This is my go to place for a nice dinner of even just drinks in town."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have ever had!  The staff was very nice, the decor was very nice, a bit dark, but very elegant. We ordered a mix drink, and an appetizer of Chicken skewers which were awesome!!!  They come with fried pork won tons and dripping sauces that were very good.  We ended with a glass of wine from there very large selection.  I think we will be stopping in here every time we make our way to Madison."}
{"text":"I come I to town every so often on business and this is one restaurant I keep coming back to. Every dish is unbelievable. The only knock I have on it is that they don't have one near my home. Anyway the atmosphere is very pleasant and the service makes some high end manhattan restaurants feel like a Denny's. I would eat here all the time if I could and I will eat here every time I'm in the area. Highly highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! We came here because it was close to our hotel and it had good reviews. They didn't disappoint.   We ordered a cheese plate, string beans, the pork belly, and flat bread (we had a party of four). The cheese, and all the other things that come on the plate (olives, grapes, etc.) were fantastic. The pork belly was very filling and could have gotten heavy, but with the string beans, it was completely fine. The flat bread was large and had lots of toppings, but wasn't very \"flat.\" It felt like a pizza instead, with the bread being quite thick and not very crispy. Still, it was good though.   All in all, they were great. They also have a great wine selection, which doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"Cool place, reminds me a lot of some wine bars I used to go to in California, except without the insane crowds.  Prices very reasonable.  They do pour their liquor judiciously so just be aware of that."}
{"text":"Eno Vino is a hidden treasure.  Great wine list, excellent service (thank you Taylor!) and small plates that each had their own unique, delicious taste.  We went on Sunday evening when select bottles were half-off----a great bargain on some unique wines.  If you're in Madison, it's worth the 15 minute drive to Middleton to experience this gem!"}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's day and had the five course meal. The atmosphere is great and very romantic. The food was good as was the service. We could get two different wine pairing and chose one of each. The elite was $20 more but it was much better. It was about $260 with tip for the night but I consider that to be special. I can't wait to go back and get wine flights in the lounge with some of their small plates.  I wish I could give a 4.5 but it wasn't quite at a 5 for me. The third fish course didn't blow me away and they could have poured a little more wine for the price.  But we will be back and I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Upscale, nicely lit, sensual setting serving a variety of interesting small plates. Very big city like space in the west side of Madison.  I enjoyed the Sweet Chile Calamari fries and a long list of their other small plates (memorable ones include the Pheasant, diver scallops, ahi-poke, hanger steak)  Also, amazing cold water lobster bisque (but probably better of sharing it - it is rich and filling)  They also have a long list of wines and drinks including the amazingly dessert-like Peanut Butter Martini or the flaming S'mores martini!   They have really nice desserts as well  - with a hearty chocolate fondue included (it is large -- good for 3 people) as well as a molten lava cake and a great creme brulee!  Note -- it can get a bit pricey as the tapas add up, so be warned! :-)  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Visiting my niece in Madison who just started working in the city, we Yelped and found Eno Vino. What a find! The first tough choice was to sit in the very comfortable looking Wine Lounge with nice couches and chairs or the lovely dining room. We chose the dining room and were quickly presented with menus and the wine list on an iPad.  Starting off with a delish Viognier, and  four different bruschetta dishes was a great lead to a journey all around the menu with not a single disappointment. You could literally close your eyes, and hit a spot on the menu and be pleased. Along with a great red from the Rhone Valley, we then tried about 6 different tapas all leaving us wanting more as well as a splendid presentation. The kitchen staff was also very accommodating with my wife's new found allergies and making sure she didn't have 2 ingredients in the meals. Of course, all the ingredients were farm fresh with no fillers or  additives. The wine selection was excellent and we ended with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to split and three ports. We may not be back to Madison, but my niece cant wait to start bringing her friends to this delightful little bistro. If your in Madison, please give these guys a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great place to go with a group of friends. There were 6 of us. We did have to wait quite a while for a table. It was longer than they quoted us and I think they might have had some sort of mix up at the host stand. Maybe we were extra aware of it because most of us have or do work in the restaurant industry. Anyways, we had a great time sharing food and several bottles of wine once we got seated. Everything was tasty. Our server was attentive as well."}
{"text":"Just went there for fathers day and I have to say, hands down the best food we've had in Madison so far. We've tried other restaurants such as Graze, 43 North, etc. and they've all be hit or miss. This place blows both places out of the water. Sauces on the dishes are so good, I wanted to lick them clean. Had the steak, pork belly and green beans and I would have each of them again. Pork belly especially was extra delicious. The owner goes around and checks on you and also brings you the check. Who wouldn't want to give a restaurant like this their business. If you eat here, I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I'll admit I came in with a bit of an attitude, since it's in a strip mall near Target. I was pleasantly surprised and have been back since. A great place for a date or to go with a group of friends because the dishes encourage sharing. And they have a great wine & cocktail list. Very fun for a night out, and beautiful ambiance."}
{"text":"All is great at this place: delicious food, great service, nice atmosphere - but for the amount of food you get... this place is outrageously overpriced. If you go there and actually have some food - expect to have an expensive bill..."}
{"text":"Great tapas restaurant with variety for everyone. Went with a party of 16, 4, and 8 during the week a few months ago during travel for work.  This place is busy and it is best to have reservation in advance, even during the week.  The best experience was with the party of 8 where we were able to order 3 to 4 plates each and share with the entire table. The flatbread portion size is huge and filling.  The cheese board was delicious. My favorite was fig and brie combination. Other favorites were ahi tuna tacos, sea bass plate, and the flan dessert. The green beans were very spicy, but it had an interesting presentation on flames. My friend did have the pork dish and it seemed under cooked.  I am not sure if that is how it is typically prepared.  Everything else was very good.  If we do return to WI, there will be a return trip to Eno Vino."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday evening for Happy Hour and regret it. It was a meal that was not worthy of 4 stars on Yelp and only memorable for being the most expensive 100% mediocre meal I have ever indulged in. It makes me cringe. It was a noisy venue, annoyingly pretentious in presentation and worst of all- the food was sadly lacking in flavor. The wine was fine but I would never dine there again.   When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation as if it was expected.  The mini-strip mall restaurant was half full that Thursday night. When we said no, we had the choice of sitting in the bar or at a table. We asked for a table only to find that happy hour prices were reserved for the bar patrons who were sitting just on the other side of a half wall about ten feet away... At tables. We stupidly decided to stay put. As the night went on, they certainly looked happier over there. First mistake?  We ordered the chili calamari fries, spinach salad, chicken satay skewers, and the short rib. Start to finish the food looked decent (they seem to favor linkin log style presentations with lots of sauce splatters) but the flavors lacked development and at best seemed watered down.  The spinach salad was unremarkable but fine, with the typical dried cranberries and cheese crumbles. You know, like the salad you make at home.   Pass on the calamari fries if you actually like calamari. The chili fries might have just been chicken tenders covered in super thick breading and slightly gooey on the inside. Not very chili at all. Little fried bits of shallots and garlic with Parmesan cheese and a little bit of balsamic mostly fell to the bottom of the plate. Crispy garlic spears were amusing dramatic garnishes. A clump of olives and some tomato sauce on the side were decent and helped the calamari feel even more like bread sticks.   The chicken skewers were plain grilled breast on sticks with ONE sprig of cilantro and a drizzle of very light peanut vinaigrette, which was mostly on the plate, and not the chicken. The dipping sauce had almost no flavor but it was brown so something must have been in it. Three potstickers came with some spicy ketchup, which tasted great in comparison.   The short rib looked promising- tiny little plantain taco presentation- but was bland and smothered in a thick, pasty cream sauce. A drizzle of green and red on the plate had some halfhearted flavor but it was pointless since it was, again, minimal and just sitting on the plate. It could do nothing to help the tacos. It was almost cruel. I tried to smear the side of the taco around in it- but it was too weak against the smothering power of the cream and let's be real, it wasn't very civilized. Maybe if plate licking was allowed things would have tasted better??  TLDR: Good for spending money, not for eating."}
{"text":"Okay...we ate here three nights in a row.  It's that good.  The brushette was incredible!  We tried about 6-8 tapas each night and was impressed with each one."}
{"text":"Very pleasant wait staff, great food variety and a swanky nighttime atmosphere. Eno Vino is most definitely one of the west side madison gems. I'd go back everyweekend, but then I'd go broke."}
{"text":"This place is just lovely.  I have a fantastic time when I go the food is very great if you are thinking of coming here don't walk..run to it.  The staff is super friendly.  Sadly, I live in another state, but always make a trip here when I am in town.  I was craving one of the drinks on their menu so bad I decided to give them a call to see if i could stir one up on my own they were so helpful gave me quick mixology lesson and sent me on my way.  Masters at this place I tell you."}
{"text":"The food, the wine, and the servers are great! We had an issue with some appetizers that were ordered for pick up.  The staff were extremely apologetic, definitely took care of us, the results were great, and the food was terrific.  They handled the issue as every good business owner should and better than most. This is a business that understands costomer service. I look forward to going there and enjoying more of the good food and drink."}
{"text":"I dine at Eno Vino regularly. There food is amazing, the atmosphere is perfect, good music, comfortable seating (dining room, cocktail section, bar), the staff is very friendly & knowledgeable. Overall Eno is my favorite restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for a year before moving to NY a few months back. This is by some distance my favorite restaurant in Madison...and Madison food scene is no push over. The baked goat cheese, and the scallops are particularly memorable. My wife, who is vegetarian, found the food excellent, particularly the truffle fries and bruschetta. The wine flights here are famous, of course, but the cocktails were a pleasant surprise too."}
{"text":"2 stars for location 3 stars for decor/atmosphere 5 stars for drink/wine list 5+ stars for food  If you want to go someplace outside of downtown Madison, don't waste your time going anywhere else. Their food and drinks are just INCREDIBLE. All the seafood I had (shrimp, scallops, lobster, crab leg) was very fresh, the bruchetta yummy, good flatbread pizza and delicious (although very frosted) red velvet cake.  The problem is, someone's always got to be the designated driver to get out to Middleton, and with great wines and cocktails, no one wants to volunteer."}
{"text":"Wow! Great wine, great food! My fiance and I went out on a date here last month and enjoyed everything! The food is exactly like the tapas we were hoping for. We both treated ourselves to a rather expensive glass of wine and had a great time! It was one of the best nights out in a while. Regarding food, I highly recommend getting the beef tenderloin bruschetta was marvelous. I wish we had ordered a whole plate of it.  This place is classy and the food quality matches the price paid--so don't be shy ordering extra dishes. We ate outside on a warm night and the atmosphere was great--a parking lot view, but still just right.   A note to men: if you are looking to treat your lady to a classy yet mildly casual dinner--I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Food was good as usual. We especially enjoyed the PEI mussels with a coconut corn sauce.  Two complaints however. The noise level approaches that of a boiler factory. It was difficult to hear my wife on the other side of a small table. Some soft surfaces to absorb sound would help a lot.  Second, i had asked for the dessert to come with a candle to honor my wife when I made the reservation. I called 2 hours before our reservation to remind them and to say that we wanted the warm chocolate cake with a candle on it. Guess what. No candle and no recognition of her birthday."}
{"text":"Just went to Eno Vino for the first time this past Friday, with my boyfriend. We loved it!! The cheese board was awesome! Unlike other places, at Eno, you can choose your cheeses from a large list so you're getting exactly what you want. We also had a few other tapas plates, which were excellent and we ended our dinner with the creme brulee which was to die for! It had a brownie layer and strawberry jam layer under the creme brulee. You MUST get it for dessert!   The manager stopped by our table and asked how everything was and you could tell how much he appreciated us stopping in. Our server was attentive and prompt. The atmosphere is classy and perfect for a date night or a girls night out. I can't wait to go again! This is my new favorite tapas restaurant!"}
{"text":"Previously posted on Open Table - from a dining experience on 5/22/10  We have enjoyed a number of meals with Eno Vino. In this visit, my date and I both had the chef's specials - prosciutto wrapped salmon for me, and kobe steak for her. We started with an appetizer of tempura battered shrimp. Everything was quite good - her steak was amazing. The service however was disappointing. Despite a clear message to our waitress that we were not in a hurry and wished to take our time (and with many open tables - no need to turn ours quickly) - we went from drinks to appetizer to dinner in less than 30 minutes. Somehow we felt a little cheated - the experience not quite as enjoyable as it would have been if we could have lingered over things and had some space in between."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 had 7 tapas- all were excellent! Calamari Fries, Bruschetta, Baked Goat Cheese, Mushroom Rav, Sage Gnocchi, Beef Short Rib & Thai chicken Flatbread were all great...particularly the Mushroom Rav & Gnocchi.  Our server (Sherman) was excellent- extremely knowledgeable. He provided great recommendations and very attentive service. Service was smartly paced with attention paid to variations in flavors and dishes were served accordingly   Will definitely return when we are in the Madison area. The bill for the food (we couldn't finish the last dish & took it home) was $120 which included a bottle of 171 Terrazas Malbec...really not bad considering the high caliber of the food & service.  Visited August 2011"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food and a good wine list. At the bar is where it is at! Attentive, friendly bar staff. Only complaint is the red wine is often a bit warm, not quite cellar temperature."}
{"text":"Eno Vino has slid downhill BIGtime.  It used to be one of the only westside places that could kinda pass as a big city wine-bar....but the shortcuts they are now taking are embarrassing.  Just one example: the \"cheese plate\" tapas had a slice of Target quality brie with enough to cover 2 water crackers, which is astonishingly what they choose to serve it with.  The other cheese is of similar quality and they serve it with a bunch of grapes that maybe were on the shelf at Target for 6 days past their sell-date.  The pear was sliced well though, jeesh.    As for the atmosphere, whatever you do, don't go on Badger's game nights, for the clientele act like they could be at a drunken tailgate, obnoxious and loud, bumping into you like you're in a sports bar.   They are slacking and it shows, maybe the drunks wearing all red won't notice, but if you're going there for a chic opportunity to dress up and act like a grown up, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a fantastic gem in Madison!  My husband and I shared each plate and couldn't wait for the next!  Their crab cakes and the Korean short rib potstickers were awesome!  Fantastic wine selection as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best food in Madison, however extremely spendy.  Good service and great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bit of a culinary adventure, Eno Vino is the place to go!  Tapas lets you try a bunch of different things and they've got a wide variety of different bistro-fare to try. Each time we go, we get two dishes per person and that gets us quite satisfied even with the small portions.  Bruschetta - You get to pick four different varieties, this is where you'll be able to try something new each time. I would particularly recommend the Smoked Salmon and the Brie and Apple.  Chicken Skewers - The chicken was a bit dry but the sauces (cilantro lime, thai ketchup) made up for it.  Mushroom Ravioli - This had to be the most disappointing dish but that's not saying much. It was pretty good, just felt a lot less food for the price of the dish.  Seared Tuna - The tuna was perfectly cooked, cold in the middle, warm on the outside.  Overall very satisfying, I plan on coming here again and again."}
{"text":"Great food, great for sharing multiple dishes without over stuffing yourself. 2 drinks that are a must...the peanut butter martini & the effing delicious drink. Yes that's what it's actually called! You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"When I moved to the Madison area, it took me a few months to find a restaurant that really stood out. While there are many offerings around the Capitol and on Willy St., there is no better option, in my opinion, than the west side's own Eno Vino.  The atmosphere, decor, and ambience are very inviting and wine and food pairings are top notch.  Each time I go, I make it a point to get the truffle fries and pork belly, as the combination of rich flavors and the flawless execution of the dishes are truly a sight to see and taste.  Eno Vino is great for a night out with friends or for a romantic night with the plus one and is a staple in my repertoire of restaurants that should be experienced over and over again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and wine served by the most knowledgeable, friendly and polite people,  I highly recommend the charred hot house tomato soup, lump crab cakes and seared sesame tuna."}
{"text":"Tapas, tapas, tapas and this place makes some great ones. My wife and I have been here before and enjoyed it but it had been quite some time ago, so we remedied that by going here on Sunday. Lucky for us on Sundays they have \"all day happy hour\" so how could we not indulge ourselves.   We both love calamari and have enjoyed it here before so that was a must. Their calamari is more of a \"stick\" style but it has great flavor. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is I wish they would have drizzled some of their cilantro lime jus (I think that's what it was, the sweet sauce from the Thai chicken skewers) over the calamari to give a sweetness to match their subtle spicy flavor. Speaking of the Thai-chicken skewers, I enjoyed them, but probably due more to their included sauces than the actual skewer itself.   We finished with a Thai chicken pizza which was really good. I personally would have liked a little more peanut flavor as it seemed to get lost and resulted in more of a chicken pizza with jalape√±o slaw and lettuce, but again I enjoyed what I had and would order it again. The drinks we ordered were well mixed and nicely sized for an enjoyable evening for two.   If you are looking for a great place to enjoy a tapas style dinner this is a great place. And as a man, I know sometimes men who aren't in the know about tapas and their first thought is \"great, am I going to leave full?\" Yes, fellas your tummy will leave happy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite area restaurants, but a bit pricey, if that scares you. Absolutely the best grilled cheese sandwich in the world (served with an outstanding tomato bisque soup). The Carpaccio and foie gras and seared ahi are all great for a Madison restaurant. The pork belly was way too fatty for my tastes. Beautiful ambience, terrific bar and wine flights. I think they're trying too hard to be hip with the IPad drink menus, but the technology-challenged might be impressed."}
{"text":"My friends and I like to get together after work whenever we can and Eno Vino is one of our favorites!  We're all fans of wine, though none of us claim to be experts, and we love trying different wines each time.     Ok, on to the food!  So MY personal favorites have been the brie and apple bruschetta and the fresh mozzarella bruschetta, as well as the four cheese flat bread pizza.  Being a slightly picky eater, those are primarily my go to items.  Another thing I love is the outdoor seating.  I don't think there are enough places in Madison that offer outdoor seating so that's always a big plus for me!  I'm always looking for an excuse to go there and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"One of my Favorite restaurant in the Madison area great atmosphere with a upscale and modern look, great service and great food! The food is a great take on American cuisine and fusion! The calamari was great the Tenderloin was also really good but the chicken with the Peanut sauce was delicious (chicken satay) the pork was also really good!!   One of my favorite restaurant in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"Good tapas and everything was tasty.  Service was a little slow, but they were busy in their defense."}
{"text":"Took the mr. here for his birthday this weekend.  Was a little disappointed that my OpenTable reservation was not in their system although I had a confirmation.  We were still seated without delay,but I won't get my points for the reservation.  Started with cocktails, which were solid and not exceptionally overpriced. The bread and roasted red pepper spread arrived promptly, and were both delicious.  Actually, service overall here is very good- prompt, friendly but not intrusive.   We ordered crab cakes, chicken skewers and a four-cheese flatbread.  At $16.00, the crabcakes were disappointing, to be honest.  They were delicious, but were also the size of a large strawberry- definitely not enough to share.  The chicken skewers were delicious, with thai ketchup and cilantro lime sauce for dipping, accompanied by three pork wontons-yum!  The four-cheese flatbread was decptively simple- and was the mr.'s far and away favorite.  I have been here before with girlfriends, and actually think that Eno Vino is more fun for ladies' night than date night."}
{"text":"Eno Vino has to be one of the best restaurants in the Madison area. The food is outstanding. I've been here for work happy hours, girls nights, and dinner with my husband - each time we leave happy :)"}
{"text":"Good for happy hour with work! Good pork belly and calamari."}
{"text":"So good!!  My kind of place!!  Good atmosphere, flavorful food, good wine list!!  Low lit, decent noise level, nice decor/bathrooms.  We shared a few tapas dishes: pork belly, lobster ravioli, risotto, smoked salmon bruschetta, brie and pear bruschetta and Decoy cab.  All was delish, nice presentation, service was impeccable!!  Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"While still living in Denver I would visit Madison every so often and at the time Eno Vino was the closest feeling of a place that had unique food options of \"home\" that I could or was willing to seek out. They have an extensive Tapas menu, a really good wine list but their seasonal craft cocktail/mixed drink options are divine. Some of the best options here are the incredible Ahi Tuna Tacos, Lump Crab Cakes, Korean Short Rib Pot Stickers and the chicken skewers. They also have a thai flatbread that is terrific. stay away from the chile Calamari Fries perhaps I am just naive but i thought it would come out resembling normal calamari but instead you literally get thick, french fry cuts of fried squid...groooooss. This is a Tapas restaurant so the plates are small and expensive and if you have a WI appetite chances are you will be ordering more than one plate of an option if you enjoy it.  I am giving this place two instead of four stars for a few serious reasons. Number one, Madison is  REALLY taking off in the food scene and Eno Vino has seemed to be content with offering the exact same options ever since I have been going there they have become standard and rote. Also, I do not know if I just noticed this or if it has always been but they have a Ladies Night. Really? Really? Hello folks, this is 2016 not 1986 OR 1996 OR 2006 for that matter. Do bars even do ladies nights anymore? So dated. Also upon the last two visits the server did not know the options on the menu and we were not greeted promptly by our server at our table and in the last case she wandered off...someheres..perhaps to become a vegas showgirl or something and the very apologetic managers had to come over and actually assist/serve us.  Lastly, Eno has gone the way of Red Robin and TGI Friday's and now have an option to use a tablet at the table to do your selecting and ordering. This is no excuse for not having enough staff or not willing to afford good waitstaff. It is truly a shame because i still want to like this place but cannot see myself going back."}
{"text":"Just about my favorite Madison-area restaurant. Food is always good and they always have delicious martinis. The ambiance is perfect for date night or a night out with the girls, or even a classy night out with a group of friends.  The staff is excellent. They take the time to make sure you have a great experience and give great recommendations. I go there any chance i get."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite restaurant in Madison.  The food and service were amazing.  It's a perfect place to go for a special date night and people watch if you're into that kind of thing.  We started with the Seared Sesame Tuna and the Tempura Shrimp.  Portions are generous for tapas.  My husband loved his tuna and it was cooked perfectly.  We both loved the tempura shrimp and the avacado and tomato dipping sauce were an excellent accompaniment.   We then had the braised pork belly and this dish is everything its touted to be.  I wanted to roll around on the plate, it was so good.  The only downside was the shrimp and andouille sausage flatbread.  It wasn't that it was bad, it was just that everything else was so good that it seemed like as a finisher that pizza was way too casual of food after everything else we had.  I would go with the scallops next time.  Our server was amazing and on point.  He was very attentive without being overbearing.  We would definitely come here again.  Expect to spend about $130 for two with several tapas, drinks, and tip, but I believe good food is worth it."}
{"text":"I love Eno Vino, especially their happy hour! Happy hour is from 4-7 Monday - Friday and they have plenty of drink and FOOD specials! I love coming with friends ordering a couple of their items off of their happy hour menu and drinking one or two of their delicious cocktails/glasses of wine. It's totally tapas style and that is my favorite way to eat! I mean who doesn't want to try a little of everything?! For cocktails my favorite is the mojito. Nice and fresh! As far as food selections go there really isn't a bad thing on the menu (at least that I've tried.)  Although not on the happy hour menu I have had their cheese board and fell in love! So good! If you love cheese, you need to try it!"}
{"text":"We love to sit at the bar and have appetizers and cocktails.   The bartender are attentive without being annoying.   The food is spot on.    Try the Ahi Tuna. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've come to Eno Vino for few years now and it honestly is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The experience ranges anywhere from a two to a four star rating. My most recent experience was a two and it was extra disappointing because we were here to relive our first date on our two year anniversary.  The ambiance of the place is great. Classy looking inside. Depending on where you are seated, you can be placed in a warm, friendly, and open  environment inviting to a large group,  or a more secluded setting that would provide more of a feel for a date.   This is a tapas place, so you will be getting small plates. The flavors arent too bold and there is some great variety. The food can be hit or miss, but, for those that are a hit, I truly believe they surpass the let down of the miss. The menu does partially rotate so if you came here you will be presented with new options, while the classic options will hang out.  The service could be improved. The wait staff never impresses me when coming here, average at best. Last time, our waitress did not seem very knowledgable about the dishes on the menu nor the wine list. She also did not check up on is at the appropriate times.   The last time we were here, we were seated in a spot where cold air was blowing on us continuously from a vent. It was cold outside and this felt very unwelcoming.  We asked to be moved and despite the restaurant being completely empty we were only allowed one option of where to move. Keep in mind we are trying to celebrate an important event here. What's interesting is that three other couples who were seated after us asked to be moved also. Eno Vino needs to fix that immedately and not use the table until fixed."}
{"text":"Great interior with an upscale but still casual vibe.  My first time visiting.  Found the menu to be intriguing, and the service was warm and welcoming.  ahi tuna tacos with jalape√±o slaw were really fresh, well presented, and the tacos held themselves well.  Sturdy little guys.  the green beans with fried shallots and Thai vinaigrette is excellent!  As well, the lobster ravioli was pretty decadent.  Only issue I had was that the plates came so fast.  Maybe not a big deal, but I was dining alone, and basically had all three plates of food on the table at the same time.  Definitely felt like I was being rushed, although probably not the case. Whatever the case, I was impressed and happy to experience Eno Vine Wine Bar.  Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"We come regularly and enjoy this place for well executed tapas and a fun, sophisticated ambiance. The truffle fries and sea bass with scallops are favorite dishes. I personally would pass on the tempura, heavily breaded. Don't bother with scotch, the pours here are paltry. You will be much happier if you order a cocktail or wine flight ( it is a wine bar, after all...)    My favorite seating is either at the high top bench that overlooks the kitchen ( if you want to be entertained by watching the dishes being prepared) or the tables at the extreme right of the bar around the corner past the fireplace ( for a quieter spot ).    Be warned... The entrance is in a strip mall and does not hint at all of the warm, energetic, classy interior.    This is a convivial place to go with friends, or a few couples. A first date is probably not a good choice as the volume may keep you from getting to know each other. Leave the kids with a sitter, not a place for families with young kids.    All in all, a fun, tasty, social, local restaurant which does not disappoint."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ad in 2013, and perhaps all-time. Every dish was fantastic. Started off with a terrific waitress, Emily, who was bright and sunny without being to sacchariney. She offered up some great suggestions. And when we ordered the tuna suggested we add an extra portion since our group was five and likely would not have had an easy time breaking up the crostini.  Anyway, Eno Vino is small plates (couple dozen to share), plus soups, salads, and flatbreads. Deep and high quality wine list too.  The SEARED SESAME TUNA with wasabi and endive was to die for (and I rarely use that metaphor for food). Wonderfully deep red in color, the tuna was perfectly rare with a great outside sear atop the endive and herbed crostini. Loved the wasabi reduction. Great heat to go with the refreshing tuna.  Also enjoyed GOAT CHEESE PASTRIES red and golden beets, basil emulsion, smoked Hawaiian sea salt, aged balsamic, pancetta. Beats and basil emulsion proved a perfect pairing for the soft, warm pastry.  TRUFFLED FRIES aged cheddar cheese sauce, Thai ketchup and roasted garlic aioli. Truffle oil makes everything better. Best fries ever.  SWEET CHILE CALAMARI FRIES shallots, olive vinaigrette and Eno Vino's red sauce. Oh so yummy. Calamari was perfectly cooked. Real winner.  SEARED DAY BOAT SCALLOPS with savory french toast, truffle butter and black figs. Also one of the best dishes of the evening. The french toast soaked up all the truffle butter and the scallops were moist and firm, perfectly cooked.  DUCK CONFIT RISOTTO grilled seasonal mushroom, shaved parmigianno reggiano. Good. Weakest of a very strong lineup.  MAPLE LEAF FARM DUCK BREAST jalape√±o polenta cake, blueberry and sage jam, crispy leeks. Fabulous. The jalapeno and the blackberry jam offered the perfect sweet and spicy combo. The duck was so tender and moist. YUMMMMM!  BRAISED PORK BELLY smoked gouda biscuit, tomato confit, sage mornay, fried egg. Very good. Love pork and sage together.  Also had MUSSELS IN CURRY. Very good, especially the curry sauce. Soaked up nicely with the side of bread.  I am not one to give out five stars with regularity but this was way too good to give it anything else. Throw in our 2009 Brouilly and it was just awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. The prices are a little high but is to be expected for the type of restaurant that it is. The flat bread, I believe it's called the Thai flat bread was one of my favorite things. You forget in places like these how easy it is to run up a $300 bill Great place, I love it!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: fine-dining small plates.  I looked for any reason not to give Eno 5 stars and couldn't find one. Wine list and libation selections were varied and plentiful. Space, though located in an unassuming suburban strip-mall, was surprisingly posh. Service couldn't have been more spot-on. And the food, mmm the food.  I was lucky enough to come with 6 other people because we had the chance to try nearly the whole menu. Some items were better suited for 4 or 6, but everyone got at least a taste of everything.  Standouts in my opinion were the Chorizo Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, P.E.I. Mussels, and Portabella Mushroom Ravioli. If I had to pass on anything it'd be the Green Beans and Tempura Shrimp. But really, even those were still tasty and well-prepared.   Eno Vino is one of those places you should expect to dress well and pay well, but you'll definitely get what you came for."}
{"text":"My friend and I really enjoyed our meal. We got the bruschetta (beef tenderloin, genoa salami, and smoked salmon), the roasted asparagus soup (the soup du jour), the calamari sticks (pretty good, though kinda greasy, and my friend and i were confused as to how the calamari was shaped like mozzarella sticks), and the pork belly (AMAZING).  i had a beautiful glass of cotes du rhone, and my friend got a white russian, which he claimed was a little short on kaluha.  we weren't expecting to be full, but we could barely walk out of there!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Beautiful presentation. Perfect portion sizes. Reasonable prices. Excellent wine selection. Great night out dining. And.... BEST CR√àME BR√õL√âE EVER!!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I decided happy hour was the best time to go. And it was. They have great specials on small plates, pizzas and bruschetta wine and cocktails. I went with the bruschetta special (2 for $8) and got the mozzarella one (more traditional) and the prosciutto with asparagus, cheese and  apricot jam. They were both very good and large, but the prosciutto one was my favorite. Perfect combination.  Then I went off the happy menu to the regular menu and order the crab cakes. These were on the tinier side, but packed a great flavor. They laid in a champagne buerre blanc with baby rocket.  I used the complimentary bread to soak up all the sauce. Again great combination.  I had two glasses of wine and the two dishes which came out to $50."}
{"text":"The first time I tried to come here, the wait was too long so we ended up going to Biaggis. Second time, we made a reservation. I went with 2 others and we ordered the tuna (so good), truffle fries (good), cheese board (okay/cute), pork belly (pretty good), and chicken satay (okay). We couldnt decide which bottle of wine we wanted to go with so the waiter brought us 5 sample glasses for us to try and asked us for the price range we want to try as well. It was a great experience overall. We sat there for ~3 hours just eating, drinking, and talking. After around 2 hours, we ordered the chocolate fondue for dessert, which was really good and nice. Great atmosphere; I like the booths and lighting."}
{"text":"We always had great food and great service here.  It can get pricey with wine.  To save money get one tapa per person and then fill up on a flatbread pizza to share.  Used to be one of my favorite places to eat until my wife developed an allergy to crab, now we can't really eat there anymore since they apparently use the same tongs for their crab cakes, and the other dishes (even the steak) and were unwilling to make changes to accommodate her allergy :-("}
{"text":"Have you been to Eno Vino on Junction Road? Good. Savor the memory. Your favorite drinks (some of them, like Kinda Blue, are really amazing) are not at the new Eno Vino at the AC Marriott. Most of your favorite menu items are not either; at the west location you're hard-pressed to choose from the large, enticing selection, but the selection downtown lacks in comparison (and, as it turns out, in taste). When my friend made a reservation she had requested a table by the window (everyone does) because we were celebrating a special occasion; two in our party of three were celebrating birthdays. Those requests can't be guaranteed, of course, but two tables were seated just before us--by the window--so the request could have been accommodated after all (especially since one person in our party had arrived even before the others were seated). Either way, not only did we not get the window seat, but we got a table that had a fully obstructed view; the two people who looked towards the window actually faced a pillar (the Capitol was behind it). Did anyone say \"happy birthday\" to us? Nah. Then came time to eat. If you find yourself at Eno Vino downtown, do yourself a favor and order the tomato soup. It's absolutely delicious, and comes with four mini grilled cheese sandwich wedges. You'll wish it's the only thing you ordered, both because it's so very, very good, and because everything else is so very, very bad. The crab cakes were patties of shredded crab, far inferior to any frozen crab cakes you've ever tasted, and with not a single lump of crab meat in them. The risotto was uninspiring and bland. The lamb meatballs made me feel sad that a lamb died just to make, well, this. With chunks of fat in them, tasting boiled and undercooked, the red sauce they came with barely made it possible to swallow each bite. The chef's special, and I use both the words \"chef\" and \"special\" magnanimously, was a sockeye salmon served at room temperature and drenched in the kind of hollandaise sauce (yes, you read right; hollandaise) that would cause both sauces and Holland to take offense. If you fed it to your cat it would wait until you fell asleep and scratch you to pieces. We didn't attempt dessert, because this was my second time at Eno Vino downtown, and I remember the tiny brittle cubes of poundcake and paper-thin strawberries that fell off the fork into the chocolate fondue (not worth the attempt to eat this; just go to the Opus Lounge down the street that does it right) and the apple pie with cheddar cheese chunks that tasted as appalling as it sounds.  When this location opened, the Isthmus review wrote \"if you want the best view in Madison go to Eno Vino, but if you want the best food don't.\" It was much too generous. You will get better food at any food cart, and the view is apparently hit and miss too. If you dare walk past Graft or the Heritage Tavern on your way to Eno Vino, I hope you take a wrong turn and get lost. The delay may give you a chance to repent and see the error of your ways."}
{"text":"The BEST place and my favorite restaurant! Tapas to vino! The Thai Chix pizza is out of this world to the ahi tuna to everything in between! Great place to take clients and/or just hang out with friends & family! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was delicious, quite pricy but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend everyone start off with their own bowl of lobster bisque - absolutely delicious. Not only are the foods good, the drinks are amazing. Favorite has got to be the Lychee Martini, a cute touch of a lychee over the drink.   If you go in the late evening, stay away from their pizzas. Absolutely gross... thats the only part where I would give it a poor rating if that was what they actually served. Overall, love it."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in the Madison area. Great menu and fun wine flights. \"Small plates\" each beautifully presented. We ordered 3-cheese plate (which includes olives, grapes, apple and peat slices, sliced bread and crackers) and then picked 4 \"small plates\" (not so small), from calamari fries, to green beans (flaming presentation), risotto and three of the largest scallops I've ever seen. Add a nice flan and strawberry rhubarb crisp and we were stuffed. Emily provided great, attentive service."}
{"text":"I just carried out Eno Vino the best food I I have on the West side of Madison in a while. I had Thai Chicken Flat bread. I loved how you have to assemble it once you get home so it isn't soggy. I have had it many times at the restaurant but this was just as taste car-ring out as in the restaurant. Love that there is just a little heat."}
{"text":"Good happy hour if you're a wine drinker. A little older crowd 35+. Menu is pricey but worth it. Most of the menu items are meant to be shared. Seems to be busy almost every night."}
{"text":"Consistently high quality drinks, eats, and service. Love their salads and small plate options. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Ok...I understand the Tapas trend...really, I do. But honestly it is getting old.   If I wanted to share what I want to eat with somebody else I will but in all reality I just want to sit down and eat good food.  My wife's friends have been raving about Eno Vino for a long time and it was time for us to try this place everyone raves about.  I will be the first to say, the food was VERY GOOD!  Myself, my wife, and a couple of others went to Eno Vino this past weekend and immediately upon arrival I knew this place had fell in the rating points when I could not find a parking stall.  I had dropped my dining party off at the door as a good boy should do and then drove around the tiny parking lot that was amassed with cars with no open spot for me.  Hell, I even found a spot and some jerkoff swung into the spot I was clearly waiting for (blinker on and all).  So, 15 minutes later a spot finally opened up and boom...time to drink.  We were seated immediately and Eno Vino has a nice look.  it is decorated well and was very inviting.  Now, I just want a drink.   Waiter....waiter...hey, where is the waiter?  Unfortunately the waiter did not come for our drink orders at least 10 minutes (if not longer) after we were seated.  This was disappointing especially after the labyrinth of cars I had just maneuvered through (not to harp on parking but, people who park in places that are not stalls should die).   Well, he finally came and although I do love wine I was not in the mood.  Crown Royal for me tonight.  After the waiter finally arrived the service was good for the rest of the night.  My meal was very delicious.  To start the Bruschetta was both amazing and eh.  Depends on what one you had.  For example, the Fresh Mozzarella was very good.  The Brie one however was not.   After the Bruschetta the meals arrived and i ordered MY OWN meal not to be shared as that is how I roll.  I want what I want and it is mine...sorry plate pickers and appetizer hogs.  I had an order of the Day Boat Scallops that were delicious.  I found it odd that it came with French Toast but it worked.  Along with that, because I am a pig, I tried the Skirt Steak (kinda like make your own tacos) and while everything was very very good I feel it could have used something more like sauce or something.  But it was very good.  So, overall Eno Vino was Ok. I did not hate the place and did not love it either.  Would I go back there for dinner, probably not but I would go sit at the bar while munching a few things and sipping some wine as long as I can find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Just because a there is a Wine Bar and Tapas style restaurant in Madison does not make it automatically a 4-5 star place. Warning: this may be a bit long and as such feel free to skip down to the food review...  Service Review:  My experience at Eno Vino was pretty disappointing. My husband and I went there for his Birthday on a Friday night. It never occurred to us to call in a reservation because we were planning on hanging at the bar until a table was ready. When we were greeted by the hostess, we were immediately asked if we made reservations-to which we replied no-and the hostess kindly told us it would be a 20 minutes wait and we could grab a drink at the bar. But then suddenly some other hostess honed in on our conversation and in a very pretentious way, explained how the wait could be 'way longer than 20 minutes' and we 'could wait at the bar but if we decided to leave that would be okay'. This immediate gave out an a vibe that we were unwanted, especially considering we didn't have a reservation.  So then we went to the bar where the only two seats available were across the bar from eachother. We took a seat and I decided to remain standing since it was my husband's birthday and I was really fine standing. Well needless to say that the gentleman sitting next to me greatly disapproved of this choice and casually voiced his opinion on the matter for the 20 something minutes we waited at the bar. Ignoring that guy and focusing on our drinks, I thought they were way too sweet and pretty weak.  After a short wait we were finally taken to our table, which was in a very cold spot in the restaurant. We has to keep our coats on our laps and scarves on because of the chill. However, the seats were comfortable and the ambiance was soothing--until our waitress came along. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day but she clearly did not want to be there. Which I believe is not okay when you are going to a slight 'upscale' restaurant(relative to the other local restaurants) where the bill will be on average $100 and I am by no means obligated to tip 20%. I use to be a waitress and I understand how a servers mood can greatly impact a customers dining experience. We still had our drinks from the bar and so she deduced we were not going to want wine with our dinner, even though we told her we were. So she promptly took out iPad away and left us for quite some time- only to come back and find out that we wanted the iPad to look at their wine flights. We ordered an Italian Red Wine flight along with Bruschetta. When the flight came out, the waitress just plopped it down and left without saying a word. Then came back with the bruschetta and took the time to explain what was what. Onto the food...  Food Review:  The bruschetta was okay. The toppings were very fresh and flavorful but the bread was underdone and chewy.  After that, we decided to order the Ahi Tuna Tacos, the calamari, and the Foie Gras(I'll admit this was not the most thought out selection)  The least offensive of the thread was the Ahi Tuna tacos. They were presented really nicely and looked absolutely delicious. The Tuna was very fresh and tasty however they topped it with a thick and creamy slaw which was heavy-headed in the spice department. The slaw by itself was scrumptious and the tuna taco without the slaw was delicious, however the combination together was not so successful.  The moderately offensive dish was the fried calamari. The calamari itself was cooked very well: tender and flavorful. However the breading was very salty and nothing really set it apart from any other fried calamari dish from other restaurants.  The biggest offense was the Foie Gras. There are two kinds of Foie Gras: fresh Foie Gras and Foie Gras. When we ordered Foie Gras, we were surprised to receive an very tiny amount of fresh Foie Gras smothered in a fig confit and topped with lots of apples and served over pumpkin bread. It was so overly sweet that when it was combined with the fattiness of the Foie Grad it led to an instantaneous feeling of nausea and dissatisfaction. We barely ate any of it and it promptly put us off the rest of our meal.   All-in-all the place is too pretentious and their food is not worth your time. While they use fresh ingredients, I do not believe their chef is competent enough to cause so much of a hype at this restaurant. In addition, the subpar and snooty service created an uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"When to Eno Vino to celebrate New Years Eve. They were having a five course dinner and wine pairing. It was amazing. The service was really great to. I will definitely keep on going back there I gave it five star!"}
{"text":"Best truffle scallops on earth! Pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Madison, and no wonder. The food is some of the best in town, easily in the top five. The bar is classy but comfortable . . . you'll hear \"chill\" music like Thievery Corporation while you sip a well-chosen wine or cocktail. It's often best to eat in the bar and sample from the tapas-style menu. Highly recommend the chilean seabass and scallops . . . I don't know how they do it, but their scallops are some of the best in the midwest."}
{"text":"There were many things on fire, but don't let that or the strip mall entrance dissuade you. The food was very well done all around, and the wine choices were inspired, even at the lower price points."}
{"text":"Be warned and definitely ask your server about plate sizes. While Eno Vino say they're tapas style, some of the plates my boyfriend and i ordered definitely could have been shared by 3 people! As far as the food goes, I give it 4 stars. Everything was really good except for a steak dish we got, which was pretty disappointing because it was $22, and well, steak! It just didn't have great flavor. And the chicken skewers were slightly over cooked - but the second part of that plate was very tasty. We didn't do wine, we both ordered cocktails instead. I thought they were priced very reasonably - $6 or $8 - and were delicious. Especially the balsamic one! And the service was great! So besides 1.5 eh dishes, my boyfriend and i had a great time and would definitely go back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for many years. Service is always attentive and there is always a decent wine by the glass option. Happy hour definitely helps the price point pinch."}
{"text":"Super Awesome!!!  Small group traveling locally enjoyed a wonderful experience with lovely Server who was very knowledgeable in the menu and wine selection. Assisted us in making complimentary selections and we were able to taste 6-7 small plates that we shared. A fantastic bottle of wine.  Everything was fantastic. Our personal favorite was the portabella ravioli the sauce was incredible. The Sea Bass was incredible. Highly recommend for ambience and menu."}
{"text":"Filling the wanting fine dining gap on the far west side, Eno Vino has been a delightful if expensive treat for the two years I've been eating there. With its impeccable presentation and wide variety of food, combined with a large wine by the glass list, my taste buds have rarely been disappointed. The only possible flaw is that the portions vary wildly across the menu items, but asking your server and multiple visits easily solve that problem. Whether I want to extravagantly entertain with a half dozen dishes or be more reasonable with two to three larger items, Eno Vino is a perfect place to relax and think about nothing but food."}
{"text":"The seared sesame tuna. arg. sosososososososo good. And the hanger steak just melts in your mouth. I'm pretty positive everything they make here is stellar. As in, it's not in their capacity to make a bad dish. Their wine list is awesome as well. I would draw hearts all around Eno Vino if I could."}
{"text":"This place is great for drinks and food. The menu changes a couple of times a year, which is great! Happy hour deals are also pretty great. If you have a drink you're particularly attached to, most of the time, they are still able to make it for you even after it's been taken off the menu. The food is very good, they will always take the time to make sure everything is satisfactory. The staff is fantastic. The only downside is, if you sit in the bar area (not up at the bar, but actually at one of the tables), during peak hours, the bar area servers some times take a while to come around because it does get really busy."}
{"text":"Went to Eno Vino twice. First on Father's Day based on Yelp's recommendation and then again to celebrate a birthday. Both times we were very satisfied with the meal. The food is fresh, the taste is well put together. We had the sesame seared tuna, the lamb tenderloin and duck breast. Every dish was unique and flavorful. One disappointment here is that they donor have sweet fruity wine that I like. Highly recommended for special occasions."}
{"text":"Here's how a night at Eno Vino should go down.  Step 1. Grab friends, and lots of them (they specialize in tapas, so their portions are small, but extremely share-able).   Step 2. Dress up. I don't mean suit and tie fancy, but also not t-shirt and jeans casual. Put on a nice shirt and indulge a little.   Step 3. Ask your server for drink/food recommendations, and get those. The service here is fantastic, and all the waiters/waitresses know the menu like the back of their hands. Your group will definitely feel like VIPs given the attentive service here.  Step 4. Branch out, and try something interesting. They have a huge wine list, decent cocktails and an unique food menu. There's something for everyone, but now's a good time to be adventurous and try something new. PS: the 007 and their mojitos are delicious.  Step 5. Get the spicy Chile calamari, Korean short-rib potstickers and braised pork belly.   Step 6. Enjoy your food and thank me later!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for drinks and was greatly impressed.  We are looking forward to being in town again and trying the food. It had wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"We started with 4 different types of Bruschetta. It was wonderful start of our meal. We ordered 4 more items to share amongst the 3 of us. Sweet chili calamari cake with a side of a very delicious red sauce, braised belly, beer braised beef taco and hanger steak. Everything we had was delicious but the braised belly was one of best I have had. It was to die for. The service was great."}
{"text":"Eno Vino has a wonderful atmosphere and generally delicious food, along with possibly the most phenomenal and well-organized wine cellar in Madison. The wait staff are full of charisma and charm, able to comment intelligently and entertainingly on any menu or drink item. The big problem that prevents me from giving them a complete rave is their prices. This is a \"small plates\" restaurant, where you should plan to order four or five items to share rather than individual entrees. That is fine when the plates are $8, $12, or even $15 for something fancy. It's another story when three scallops put you back over $20! My portion of the bill for a recent party of six people was over $90 - and remember this is only my 1/6th of the bill."}
{"text":"Eno Vino is what a wine bar is supposed to be--good atmosphere, a wide selection of interesting wines, and fun food. While a few of the menu items are only average, most of the things I have tried are well above average. I would come back here again just to have the truffle fries, let alone a chance to take another shot at the cheese board!"}
{"text":"If there's such thing as a weak martini- they achieved it. Unimpressed overall. Service felt very rushed as if the server had somewhere to go when her shift was over.  Food was \"ok\" but nothing to write home about. Atmosphere was a bit too dark and was hard to see what was on our plate. Overall an ok place - not great just ok."}
{"text":"I dine here everytime I return to the Madison area. The food is exceptional and the wine list is robust with many excellent choices. My favorite is the portabella mushroom ravioli served with a port wine cream and brandy cured foie gras...so rich and so delicious. The bar and cocktail choices offer a variety of housemade specialty drinks listed under \"Masterpieces\" on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Eno Vino's downtown location a handful of times and the location itself makes it worth the trip, the views are beautiful and the aesthetic is fresh and clean. The food is tasty and the service is prompt and polite. It gets very busy on the weekends so I decided to try out the west side location because I was craving a few of my favorites. Upon walking in I smelled raw sewage which was almost enough for me to walk out. The decor was outdated and reminiscent of a ~slightly~ nicer Olive Garden. I overheard a red head (manager?) working behind the bar poking fun at some of the guests. The vibes weren't so welcoming. I don't think I'll be back even though the location is closer to my house."}
{"text":"Being so close to so many office parks I can understand why this place is so crowded during Happy Hour.    And why wouldn't it be?  Skip the dive bars and go for one of the long list of tasty wines that Eno Vino offers.    There are budget-friendly wines that are still quite tasty.  The service could have been faster.  However, it was fairly busy and it wasn't unlike what I have experienced at other places during a crowded Happy Hour.  All in all Eno Vino is a good place to enjoy a good glass of wine and chill after the end of a long day."}
{"text":"Eno Vino is by far my favorite restaurant in the Madison area. It beats out all the hot spots surrounding the Capital and State Street. As a result, my fiancee and I became regulars at this place.  Eno Vino is a tapas-influenced Italian restaurant/winery. It offers a wide variety of small plates, flat breads, and wines, and the menu changes each season (with the more popular items staying on). This was good for us because, as regulars, we wouldn't get bored of the same small plates each time we dined at Eno Vino.   My favorite small plates are the braised pork belly, the hangar steak, and their different styles of scallops. I'm also a huge fan of their free bread. What makes it good is that each time I've been there, the spread/pastes have been different and delicious.  I highly recommend Eno Vino. You'll have a great experience with food and quality service."}
{"text":"I love Eno Vino.  It's a very relaxing atmosphere with nice decor.  The service here is some of the best service in the city.  They serve amazing cheese boards and desserts.  In addition to that they make the best sangria I've ever had.  The wine selection is quite extensive.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable about wines and are great at assisting with making wine and drink choices.  As an added bonus they actually have wine flights here.  Coming here can be a bit pricey, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Crowded, noisy, expensive --  but if you can get past that the place has a certain charm and a decent wine list. We just went here for a drink. Tab for 6 was $61, and I just didn't sense the value or enough charm. Buy 2 bottles of wine and drink them at the arboretum."}
{"text":"Eno Vino has a very nice atmosphere & is a great place to go for drinks & appetizers.  The service provided was excellent, the food was delivered timely and drinks quickly refreshed. The food I had was very tasty and the beef tip pizza & truffle fries were fantastic.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Great food every time I come. The happy hour is where it's at; $8 calamari fries is a nice bargain and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Fun place.  Good food, wine list & service.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere & will definitely go back when in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Our waiter Mike was the best of the best. The food was terrific... seabass and scallops, tuna app, and filet with portabella. Amazing!!! Manager Elyse   Phenomenal. Car broke down in parking lot with a flat. Elyse sent her people.. I would give 2500 Stars... but 5 is my only option"}
{"text":"I've been a couple times, about five years apart. I was just there last week and it was just as good as I remember. The atmosphere is a dimmer lit dining room so there's definitely a laid back, chill vibe.  Their bruschetta is something every table should get to start. They have eight different types and the four my table ordered were smoked salmon, prosciutto, beef tenderloin and mediterranean. All come on crustini bread and are very good. My favorite was the smoked salmon.  For the shared items, we ordered a lot which is why I love tapas restaurants.  Korean Short Rib Potstickers: The dumplings were average. The sauces though are great. The wasabi sauce was creamy with just enough kick to not make that sinus clearing face (if you have sushi with wasabi, you know what I'm talking about).  Risotto: This was a bacon and parmesean risotto. It was really good. The rice was cooked well and not overdone. The cheese and bacon together with it was smokey, creamy and cheesy. Who doesn't like carbs, cheese and bacon?  Salt Cod Fritters: I like cod for fish fries. I wasn't sure how it would be in a fritter. It was amazing! I highly recommend this even if you do not like fish. The breading on the outside was crispy without being oily. It wasn't overpowering fish and the lemon saffron aioli goes so well with it.  Overall, you'll find something you like here if you like good food. The tables around me had great looking flatbreads as well. Their menu has so many well done items you could come back ten times and not have the same meal twice!  For all of the people staying in Madison for training at a local EMR juggernaut, this is totally worth coming to even if you have to pay for your own cab ride like I did! :)"}
{"text":"Melrose Drive quality at Madison prices.  Highly recommend it for foodies and enologists!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of friends that love it here. If you're one of them, you might not want to read the rest of this review.  It just wasn't good.  I think the host was doubling as out server... I can't be sure though since we only saw her twice. A different person brought out our food every time.  The food was bad: Skunky wine, chewy calamari, soggy pizza, and most tragically, dry pork belly with pretty much zero fat on it.  The best part of the meal was a side of green beans. I guess I really recommend getting an order of the green beans if you come here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night and the place was pretty quiet. They have an extensive wine collection and it was half off some bottles on the night we went which was a great deal. The service here was great. Our waitress was very polite, made good suggestions and came to check on us. However she never refilled our waters even after asking for it so that was kind of a bummer.   The food however, was mediocre at best. We had the cheese plate, foie gras, green beans and pork belly. The best by far was the green beans, crunchy and fresh but they were sort of swimming in a delicious but soupy peanut sauce. The cheese was great as it should be in Wisconsin and they give you good portions. We split 3 for two of us and that was more than enough. The foie gras was good no complaints. The pork belly was very heavy and not in a good way. It is a large portion of pork belly but is mostly just a two inch slab of fat. The skin wasn't crispy and it tasted like it should have been cooked a bit more so some of the fat could have been rendered out. We didn't finish this because it was just way too fatty. All in all this is a good place to get drinks but the food was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a great place to just chill and relax with a group of people. I will have to say that this is a pricier restaurant but the food here is super rich. Every single bite is full of taste! We ordered from the \"to share\" part of the menu and thought it would be enough for everyone, but sad to say the portion size was small. We left with our taste pallet satisfied but our stomach not \"full\". I would come back here to dine when my wallet is a bit bigger!"}
{"text":"We really love this place. Came a few years ago and came back recently for happy hour and dinner. Tapas are a bit larger so really good for sharing. They now have their wine menu on an iPad so you can check out pairings and details.  Loved the food. Amazing seared tuna and sea bass special. Great presentation of the lobster bisque. Amazing tomato soup with little grilled cheeses.   Good attentive service.   Loud and really dark; had a hard time reading the desert menu. Great food!!! Note: You have to actually be sitting in the bar to get hapy hour prices, you can't be in the dining room and the bar definitely gets packed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always enjoy the food. I try new things every time we go. Make reservations because this place is always busy and for good reason. Drinks are delicious. They have good happy hour prices. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Okay guys.  Eno Vino IS as good as everyone says it is.  First things first: Make. A. Reservation.  Even if it's just a random Wednesday night in April, this place will be packed.  My boyfriend took me here for my 25th birthday and we had a delightful experience.  The wine was fantastic--I got the Cloudy Bay(?) Sauv Blanc.  And the tapas were perfectly staggered.  Dishes to note:  Sea bass and Scallops, the Gruyere cheese (for the cheeseboard), crab cakes, and bruschetta.  The ambiance is a bit lounge-y (low-lighting, etc), but if you're looking for something intimate I would request a table in one of the back rooms as the main dining room can get a little noisy.  The service was perfect, our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, but also succinct (crucial!).  I absolutely cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"walking in, my boyfriend and I felt a little strange. we came here for a much needed late night date night. we were greeted by Hannah, and told they have a late night menu because it was after 10p. the late night menu was perfect even for a shareable dinner of apps. Hannah was ABSOULETY Amazing! I'm a graduate of a Hospitality restaurant management bachelors degree and I know service when I receive it, and must admit I have very high standards for a 5 star review of the service. she was extremely friendly, helpful, personable and went far beyond the call of duty of a server."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went on vacation to Madison to get away for a bit. He's been here before and really enjoyed it so we made plans to go. We went on a Friday evening and had a 7:45 reservation. We got there a little early and so had to wait a little bit (something like ten minutes, not too bad).   The decor was quite nice; very modern and lounge like although the noise level was a big turn off. I'm guessing it was so noisy because it was fairly packed and after all, it was a Friday night.  So, we ordered:  Baked Goat Cheese: absolutely fabulous. It was creamy yet wonderfully tomatoe-y which paired perfectly with small pieces of bread. The marinara sauce was good even on its own and I could have quite easily polished off the whole thing by myself!  Sweet Chile Calamari Fries: These were also very nice. I believe that the serving is meant for four people because after a few I was satisfied but there were plenty left.  The breading was great and it made it seem like you were about to dine on mozzarella sticks. There was a little bit of heat (of course) after munching on one but I found it pleasant.  Seasonal Risotto: Ours was a Gouda based risotto. It was probably meant for four people. It was heavy and cheesy and I couldn't finish. It tasted wonderful although the beef slices on top did not seem to make any sense until you taste it with a spoonful. The beef had a slight crust on top that was salty and the meat was tender.  Braised Pork Belly: Probably my favorite dish. At first you don't think all of the components would work but it surprisingly does. It works best if you slice the fried egg on top in half and let the yolk dribble down a bit, The flavors were savory and probably unhealthy for you but it was sinfully good. The tomato confit added a sweetness that was much appreciated.  Korean Short Rib Potstickers: Another favorite. You get about five pot stickers filled with short ribs that are quite tender. You are given a choice of three dipping sauces: a sweet, spicy plum sauce, a soy sauce reduction and a wasabi aoli. The aoili surprised me the most because it was such a gentle, creamy heat that was most definitely tolerable to the leary. Our waitress told us that when this item originally came out they sold out immediately.  Lemon Curd Puff Pastry: This is where it falls apart a bit. Boyfriend makes a good point in saying that the individual components were quite nice but put together was a little weird. I didn't like how little puff pastry was involved. The lemon curd was very lemony which I liked but there was too much vanilla bean cream and it overwhelmed the little square (think quarter sized) of pastry. The berry preserve was good but it got lost. There was another square of pastry at the bottom which was very difficult to cut. this dessert and the noise was why I only gave this restaurant four stars.  The service was average; there was a large crowd so moving around was a bit difficult since the tables were so close together. I'm quite sure I hit several people with my relatively small sized purse on accident while trying to navigate my way to my table. Our waitress seemed knowledgeable and made good suggestions. I wish she had been more prompt with refilling our drinks but it was quite busy and dark so perhaps she couldn't see.  The bathrooms were interesting. I've never been in a bathroom where large cans of hair spray and a basket of tampons were handed out as freebies. The potpourri was nice."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! I love the quaint atmosphere, and the food is delectable. Very classy feel, and the portion sizes are great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite tapas experiences!  Can't go wrong with the Mediterranean salata.  The white sangria is a refreshing Summer drink, pairing well with the hanger steak.  Variety of cheese board selections offer an experience you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"Love the tapa style menu, always a fun thing to do with friends.  Definitely not something I can afford to do often, but it is always a treat to introduce people to.  I usually order one or two items for the table at a time to set the pace, but it is definitely hard to choose which items to try.  Lots of options for vegetarians.  Fun cocktails, lots of choices, and they can pretty much make anything you ask for whether it is on the drink menu or not.  I like the spacey, dark, modern, comfortable atmosphere - you feel totally secluded from the outside world.  What is important to note is that the sea food is particularly good for being served in Madison."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in San Francisco what with the wine selection and items on the menu like ahi tuna tartare and steamed mussels. This is a fabulous restaurant on the west side of the Mad City with dark wood, soft lighting, friendly staff and humongous wine racks climbing the walls. Great place for a date or hanging out with friends. The only disappointing aspect was the large, plasma T.V. hanging over the bar that was always on. Seriously, only in the midwest would a fine dining restaurant have a television in it."}
{"text":"The blackened mahi mahi and beef tenderloin wrapped in bacon was made to perfection!"}
{"text":"Went up to Madison to visit with some friends for Halloween.  They suggested this place for dinner and as it was a bet lost by our friends we were open to dinner anywhere.  Go Buckeyes!  Dinner was great, we sampled our way through the menu and enjoyed their cocktails and food.  The only let down was the risotto which wasn't terrible just was not on par with everything else we ordered.  Started with the flatbread, then did the foie graiu which was fantastic.  Highly recommend the foie which was as good as any restaurant I have dined at.  We also tried the pheasant, tuna, duck, and I believe one other dish.  We were a party of 4 and we basically ordered every dish to share which worked out well.  Ask for a steak knife to cut a few of the dishes in half.  With 4 it's just the right size to share every dish we tried, any more than 4 I would suggest 2 of every plate.  Overall a great experience, good food, good cocktails, good wine selection.  On par with good restaurants in Chicago."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews. So just follow along.   When you walk in the greeters are off to the side, so it was confusing to know where to go. We were seated immediately on a Thursday night at 7. That was really nice. The tables, even for two, seem spacious.   The wine list is given to you on an iPad to share. While waiting for my dinner companion to read, another patron noted that wine was also on the back of the menu. That would have been nice to know rather than wait on a piece of tech that will tell me what kind of grapes went into my wine.  I tried a Voignier. I had never heard of it and was intrigued by a wine from Chile. I said why not?  It was good, but I should have gone with a red to match the meal. This was a sweeter wine similar to a reisling.   We skipped starters and decided to share four items: duck confit egg rolls, sauteed green beans, short rib and goat cheese.  The egg rolls were amazing. Hot, crunchy, flavorful. However, at their price point, I would have appreciate more than two egg rolls.   The sauteed green beans were a last minute add for a vegetable. And wow!  WOW! The sauce on the fresh beans are hands down the scene stealer. The description said Thai Vinaigrette, but the sauce was thicker than I expected. I wish I could begin to describe the amazingness that went into that dish.  The goat cheese was good. Standard. However, I appreciated that plentiful amount of bread that was provided.   Now, the short rib. The meat itself was delicious and cooked amazingly. However, it was doused in corn fondue. Something like that I expected on the side. It was sweet corn and cheddar and the flavor overtook the meat at times. It was too much for the perfectly cooked short rib.  Let me preface this as saying, most of the descriptions are simple so you really are not sure what you are getting.  I ordered the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee for dessert. It said brownie and raspberry preserves. I was NOT expecting that to be in the creme brulee. It was awful. There was no saving grace or that dessert. Too much happening and the components did not work together. I was sad for it."}
{"text":"If you are a huge wine fan, this is one of your best bets in Madison. The food is five star, the service is good, but the prices are high.  It's located in a strip mall, which strips away a little of the elegance.  If you can get past that, and have money to spend, this is a great place to hang with a group of good friends, impress a date, or bring a wife as a last minute surprise.  Know it is trying to be fancy, so dress up a little and enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Great wine list and Happy Hour till 7pm. Try the Cigar Zinfandel or the Ghost Pines blend. Amazing!  The appetizers are great too and come out fast. The service is incredibly good.   Don't let the outside deceive you (strip mall) because the inside is very classy, as you can see by photos.    I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because I have yet to try a majority of the food. But I will work on that :-D"}
{"text":"Wow, who knew you could find a place like this in Madison, Wi!!! This is SF, NYC quality. I mean from the drinks and appetizers to the main dish to the dessert, the service, the atmosphere, the parking, and so on. Outstanding. Sherman the waiter was so knowledgeable and easy on the eyes, great service. The atmosphere was quiet enough for a group of 8 to actually hear each other. The St Michele Cab was super yummy. The scallops, sea bass, steak special, chocolate lava cake type dessert, all yumalicious. Recommend this for bdays, special events, family, friends, business or just to get some good food. If I lived in Madison, I would eat here all the time! ps parking is super duper easy...comes with the territory I guess :)"}
{"text":"This, my friends, is where you take a woman if you're hoping for a second date.  And a third.  etc.  This place is pricey, yes.  Its worth every penny.    I had a wine there and I've never been able to find again.  Its a sparkling white with definite sweet pear overtones.  If anyone can help, please please write me."}
{"text":"With great ambience, an impressive tapas selection and excellent wine list, Eno Vino exceeded my expectations. The plates actually range from tapas size to meal size as you go down the list - we ordered 2 of the larger plates plus crab cakes as an app and it was plenty. Their presentation is impeccable. We were impressed with our wine selections, especially the Madrigal Zinfandel.   We plan to go back to try their pizzas."}
{"text":"We love Eno Vino! We travel from about 3 hours away every September for our anniversary weekend in Madison and ALWAYS go here. We are excited to see the new upgrades! We will actually be visiting in a couple weeks and going to order out since we will have our small children with this time around but we can't wait to have their food again!"}
{"text":"The renovation is everything I expected and more! They transformed an already tasteful and inviting space to a modern, sophisticated, and timeless atmosphere.  They've mastered the craft of a casual happy hour, first date, anniversary, or a \"just because\" kind of dining experience.  Cheers to revamping the old with an incredibly new vision on hospitality!"}
{"text":"This place just has it.  Ambiance, service, food, and drinks were all fantastic.  Their happy hour is great and perfect for trying a few of their dishes.  My husband loved the maple bourbon manhattan.  They have a great wine and cocktail list.  Special occasion or not, you should try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their creative food options and extensive wine list! We went for the first time for my fiance's birthday and went back a week later with friends we loved it so much! If you get a chance, try the coffee/mocha martini.... so delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had had both been here previously and had high expectations, but we left disappointed. The sangria was OK, but had no fruit in it other than the small chunks they put in your glass full of ice. The shrimp \"ceviche\" was either cold, cooked shrimp with a salsa type mix or it was ceviche-esque but completely uncleaned. I might be picky, but I get grossed out when my shrimp is full of poop, and if it's supposed to be raw I would hope they clean it thoroughly. The service was awesome, the calamari fries were great, but everything else left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Hooray!  I love this place!  Fantastic wine menu and nice atmosphere.  Definitely an older crowd than I am used to (I'm 21 and the average age is 45) but the staff still treated me like a star.  My wine was delicious and my date and I ordered the fondu plate....best fondu plate I have EVER had...amazing!  Our bartender was new and not very familiar with the menu, but with 100's of wines to keep straight, I can't fault her.  I will definitely go back!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have been to Eno Vino twice, once for an awkward first date and again to discuss marketing methods with a business contact.  On both occasions I was served, hands down, the best mojitos I've ever had--and I used to bartend.  I only ate there one of the two times, but I had the mushroom ravioli and the seared tuna.  I'm a huge mushroom and sushi fanatic, so these were great choices for me.  The seared tuna was a bit spicy for my taste, but I think table black pepper is too spicy, so don't take my word at face value.  The mushroom ravioli was one of the best mushroom dishes I've ever had.  Outstanding food and drinks, and to top it off, outstanding service -- I spoke with 4-5 servers that night and everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  If you don't like this place, you're out of your mind. 5 stars all day long."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. A little spendy but left very full and the price was worth the quality of food and wine that we received! Service was also amazing! Will definitely be returning. Would recommend the wine flights too, they were a really good deal. Oh and get the lobster bisque , you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Seriously great food and craft cocktails!! Loved the truffle fries,  beef tenderloin bruschetta, Peachy Keen and Blackberry Bourbon Smash! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"One of Madison's safest bets for a nice dining experience.  It's not extraordinary, but the food is fine and the wine list is good, as everyone notes.    It's also one of the few restaurants in town that I could imagine staying in business in another city, such as Boston.  (Yes, I always play that game with my wife.  Namely: what's the largest city this restaurant could survive in? :)  The cuisine isn't innovative, but I have yet to have a bad meal here.  (And this is the only restaurant in Madison I can say that about.)  So, if you're going out for dinner or have guests from a \"big city\" who are used to \"good\" restaurants, Eno Vino is among Madison's most consistently good choices."}
{"text":"Decadent perfect Tapas ( non Spanish) prepared by Chefs who are true Chefs.  I had the honor on my last visit to meet the Chef who created the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with Jalepeno Polenta accompanied by Blackberry reduction and Sweet Potatoe curls. There were or never will be words to describe this masterpiece.  The Pork is cooked to your specifications and the Polenta has the perfect flavor of the afore mentioned Pepper. Its creamy sublimeness melts in your mouth and makes you moan with pleasure.  The young chef who created the dish was humble and honest in his passion.Affter meeting him I knew I can never dine anywhere but here for genuine (sorry for the comparison) but\" Iron Chef\" Style Perfection.  If you are in dire need of experiencing the most amazing food in Madison, if you are a true foodie, do not hesitate to discover Eno Vino. I know for a fact that One of thee most talented True Chefs is located here.   So many of ENO Vino's creations are beyond words.  (note to Taylor) you rocked as our server Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed sharing plates every time I've been here. If the hanger steak (I believe) sounds good from the description, you won't be disappointed. Remember: sharing is caring."}
{"text":"Good wine, good food, good service - it's as simple as that.  We visited on a Saturday evening in June and sat on the patio.  In our group, we had a few different red wines and two martinis.  No disappointment there.  Food-wise, we shared bruschetta and flatbreads, both of which were delicious.  Only downsides are that the location is not very scenic (the patio faces a parking lot) and the interior lighting is super-dim, especially jarring if you were just out in the sunlight."}
{"text":"The food was really on point, although some what pricy, but I was there with some co workers for a work dinner so alls well that ends well (wellllll- paid for by my boss!).  Had some of the following and I really enjoyed it (we shared family style): -All of the Bruschetta had their individual merits/short comings; the tomatillo avocado, prosciutto, and mediterranean were my top three picks. -Truffled Fries -Sea Bass & Scallops -Hanger Steak (phenomenal) -Korean Short Rib Pot Stickers\ -Center Cut Filet (also phenomenal)  The desserts were somewhat disappointing, I would say load up on the plates to share : )"}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for over 5 years and this is still one of my favorites, if not the best. Some dishes are pricey for what you get (tenderloin, crab cakes), but the flatbreads, salads, cheese plate, and other dishes are exceptional and all a great price. If you enjoy blue cheese stuffed olives, they have the best you'll ever try."}
{"text":"Excellent selection on the menu. We haven't had anything like what we ordered before, but it was superb! Most things are meant to be shared. Great way to spark conversations. I plan to return soon."}
{"text":"More like E'Yes' Vino.   My wife and I wined and dined here for the first time this past week. We both felt that the service, wine selection, and food was absolutely incredible. Our experience there was one of the best we have ever had (that involved dinner, anyway).   We plowed through three tapas plates, (ahi tacos, calamari fries, and chicken skewers) and about half a Thai chicken flatbread, which was my favorite item. The food was out quicker than we expected and all the dishes were very flavorful and not too heavy.  As with most things in life, you get what you pay for, but even though the meal and wine plowed through our wallet a bit - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing, great wine selection, and stellar service.  Next time I'm in Madison, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"An almost perfect evening: we finally got a decent spring Saturday evening, so we wanted to dine outside. We had no problem getting a table at Eno Vino (although after I dropped my wife off, the hostesses ignored her (really, girls, is that how you want to be treated when you go out?)). If you enjoy cocktails with your dinner, this place takes cocktails as seriously as they take their wine. We never went into the restaurant itself, but evidently they were busy. That probably explains the length of time it took to get out bruschetta. However, the manager saved the evening from going south. He was attentive, and when he noticed the delay, he told us the item would be comped.  The menu is always very interesting with combinations that are original and delicious. In addition to the bruschetta, we had the truffle fires and the special risotto (pork belly) and tempura shrimp. We shared the cheesecake for dessert. All were great. We will continue to patronize this place!"}
{"text":"We are still trying new spots in Madison and last night decided to stay on the west side instead of going downtown.  As soon as we pulled into this strip mall, my gut told me that we shouldn't have.    Upon entering, it was packed so I thought maybe I had misread it.  I didn't.  We ended up getting a seat at the bar which was great but the service at the bar (how?!?!) was very spotty.  The cocktail menu reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory or another horrible chain.  The wine choices were pretty good and we had a nice Barola- with no guidance from the staff.  As far as food, we had the baked goat cheese which was pretty good except it was about 5% cheese and 95% tomatoes.  The accompanying bread was excellent- too bad that may have been the highlight.  The beet salad was ok but could have benefitted from goat cheese- oh the irony.  The sausage pizza was pretty good but nothing to remember.  I wouldn't come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service...best meal I have had since arriving in the Madison area in april..get the pork belly..oxtail..just try everything..you will not be disappointed. The service was outstanding as well as a massive wine list..will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Good food. Adequate service. Has slipped s bit   Still an experience  the flat iron steak was especially good!"}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews, I expected much more from this place.  While the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good, the rest of our experience was unimpressive.  There are many other restaurants I would visit before considering a return to Eno Vino."}
{"text":"I came to Madison Wisconsin for training and my coworker raved about this place. We decided to check it out the first night after training, really enjoyed it and came back the next night.   Bruschetta: We started off with some bruschetta and they were so good.  We were able to choose any 4 of these and we selected the following:  Brie and Apple, Prosciutto (consists of Prosciutto, apricot jam, asparagus, and fontina), Fresh Mozzarella (tomato, basil, and aged balsamic), and Beef Tenderloin (caramelized onions, gruyere, and rosemary aioli).  My favs of from there were the Prosciutto and Beef Tenderloin.  The flavors of these really worked well.   Starters: We also shared a half order of the truffle fries and they were delicious.  The crab cakes here were to die for.  They were so flavorful and fresh.     Cocktail: I ordered the effen delicious cocktail which consisted cucumber vodka, basil, fresh watermelon, and lemonade.  It was really refreshing.    Our waitress was very attentive and answered all our questions.  Definitely a location I'll have to return to whenever I am in Madison again."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.  I like the atmosphere here and they always seems to be busy.  The bar draws a nice crowd.  My friends and I meet here alot for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been to in the area. Super friendly staff. Cozy restaurant. Sat at the bar and had the Korean BBQ pot stickers. Thought they were delish. Came with 3 pretty good dipping sauces. Also got the apple brie and Caribbean salsa bruschetta. It wasn't 5 star, but it was still really good. For dessert I had the brownie creme brul√©. Also good! And to top it off, they have a great wine and mixed drink selection:)"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents and grandmother and we loved it! We got cocktails and all enjoyed them- I particularly liked my raspberry mule.  I think we also finished everything we ordered because everything was so good. My favorite was the tuna but the green beans were another favorite.  They recommended 2 or 3 per person so we went with 2 which was about portion wise. The server was attentive but not overbearing and overall it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Brought my friend here and we had the best time in Madison. Great fresh food. We had an excellent server. We ordered the seabass and scallops. Overall it was a wonderful evening although felt like the portions could have been larger. Will come back again."}
{"text":"We dined here twice in our week in Madison.  5* food, 5* service and 5* decor.  Thank you, Kenny, for helping me out with my numerous special requests.  Monday night, we enjoyed a half priced bottle of wine: Super Tuscan Luce Della Vite Lucente 2013, a Merlot/Sangiovese.  I highly recommend the smoked salmon bruschetta.  The other bruschettas I tried (brie/apples, tomatillo and Mediterranean) were fine but not as WOW as the salmon.  I loved the spinach salad with strawberries, goat cheese, granola. Best part was the orange &apricot vinaigrette, which I ordered on the side.  Best dressing I've had in a while.  I did hold the fried parsnips that were supposed to come with the salad.  The cheese plate is exceptional.  Comes with grapes, olives and other goodies. The blue cheese was my favorite.  Dessert menu could use an overhaul.  The gluten-free biscuit that comes with the peach cobbler is so vile, I wouldn't want to have it even if I needed GF.  To be fair, the waitress Jennifer was trying to hint that if I'm not GF, I might want to try a different dessert.  But I wasn't expecting the biscuit to be THAT bad.  The peach part of the cobbler is delicious.  Why can't they offer it with a normal crumb topping for the rest of us who don't need GF?  And wouldn't the GF diners prefer small crumbs of the GF topping rather than the huge, dry biscuit?  My criticism of the bread pudding is entirely unfair, since I ordered the ice cream in a separate bowl and it probably would have been fine with the ice cream dumped on top. However, it still would probably be better if the bread pudding had raisins or pineapple chunks (or both!) for both flavor and texture.  Without the ice cream, the bread pudding definitely needed something. Hey, this is Wisconsin and they serve everything with dairy and dairy with everything."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night during the holidays.  Busy place after 7 pm.  Great wine list on an Ipad.  Small plates were shared by the group of 4.  Started  out with a cheese board of 3 cheeses.  Very good.  Next had chicken scewers and pork belly biscuit.  Finished with a flat bread pizza with shrimp and Andouille sausage.  Very filling even after sharing.  Quite pricy but a nice evening out.   +/- $175.00 with tip."}
{"text":"Good time here. Service is good, not the fastest. Waiters outside smoking (5' from the door) swearing about their sections when we left. That was less than impressive."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!  The thought and precision with which they plate is relatively unmatched in Madison.  So why three stars?  Despite the fact that the food looked amazing, nothing tasted as good as it should.don't get me wrong, the fish was freshen up and everything was cooked the way it should be, but for some reason many of the dishes in our tapas style meal just lacked the intensity of flavor I would expect from a top-tier restaurant.  The wine was terrific and I will go back to give it another chance.  I just wasn't amazed...until I got the bill."}
{"text":"Awesome tapas, drinks, mood and most importantly the service. We had small group that expanded to 12 people and they were very accommodating.  I would come back to this restaurant every time I was in town."}
{"text":"Back in Madison and at EnoVino again and I will say I have yet to be disappointed!! This time I had the risotto and even had a peach cobbler dessert! DELISH!!! they do have a happy hour in the bar so if you get there early enough (I think before 7pm) they have some nice deals! GO ENOVINO!!! Pleasee come to the East Coast!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in all of Madison and for sure on the west side!! Service is always excellent. The staff are great at what they do. I love sitting at the bar for happy hour. Best happy hour in town. Best food. I'm a wine lover and they have like 300 different bottles and finest tequila and anything you want. Order the saut√©ed green beans, cheese board, any of the flat breads, pretty much anything is great. More of my favs are ahi tuna tacos, braised brisket, hanger steak, bay scallops, pork belly, bruschetta"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the braised pork belly.  It was so indulgent yet so incredible on top of its smoked gouda biscuit, topped with a fried egg.  It left us wanting more.  Oh, it was so good.  We also had the duck duet but weren't quite as impressed.  Maybe we're just not fans of duck.  I don't know.    The wines were good with a nice variety.  We particularly liked the Saviah \"The Jack\" from Columbia, Washington (2008 vintage), which is  a blend fashioned after Bourdeaux in France but much less stuffy and much less austere a wine than the Frenchies offer.     We were fortunate to be there during happy hour, which gave us a discount on each of our glasses of wine.  We were really happy about that!  The ambiance is dimly lit (the bartenders even needed a small flashlight to see or look for something), but warm nonetheless.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The service was attentive, polite, and pleasant.    I definitely want to make this a must-see stop whenever I visit Madison."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and happy hour!! Although I'm highly disappointed that once a revived my food they never asked how was it. Even when they removed my plate not a word. I will say it was very good and I will be back for sure but I wish they would have just asked. Silly I know but important to me."}
{"text":"Soft romantic warm lighting, delightful full bodied red wine. Great place to warm up after being at Camp Randall for freezing graduation ceremony"}
{"text":"Tapas in Madison, I thought NO WAY! YES WAY!!!  Great vibe, great food, great wine.  Def stop by for some great tapas and wine list, a bit overpriced...but hey there is a cost associated with decent food!"}
{"text":"If tapas style small plates, a huge wine list, great service and an atmosphere you'd be surprised to see in Madison, WI entices you... you need to try this place. Trust me.  Yes, it's tucked in the corner of a strip mall looking building... in Middleton, WI... next to a Panera Bread... but still, just trust me. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I enjoy the taste of food at this restaurant more than I do anywhere else.  Although the prices are high, the food is surprising filling.  The tapas presentation is high class and fun to share.  The atmosphere is nice, and the service is quick."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I ate here tonight after reading such good reviews.  This place does not disappoint.  Before I go into specifics, I'll say this: we've lived in NYC, DC, Philly, and Boston over the last 6 years and this place is as good as some of the best tapas bars in NYC.  The best part: being in a small town means you aren't dining in the next couple's laps like in NYC.  We had the bruschetta to start - all four that we tried were amazing.  I wasn't so sure whether I'd like the apple and fig but it was delicious - not too sweet and it paired well with the other types of bruschetta.  My fianc√© had the Kinda Blue cocktail and he honestly said it was one of the best cocktails he'd ever had.  Every dish we had was delicious.  My favorites include the stuffed piquillo peppers and the hanger steak.  Portions were perfect - usually we leave hungry from tapas bars, but I was happy-full when we left.   Please try it out - well worth the price =)"}
{"text":"Shrimp & andouille flatbread is one of my favorite meals. Wine selection is very good & fairly priced. We've sat at the bar to eat a number of times & have always been disappointed with the service. Bartenders walking by without checking in & twice as it got later in the evening being completely ignored. It was obvious they thought it was time for us to leave."}
{"text":"Great tapas menu, supurb wine list, and greart specialty cocktails which I love on a warm summer night.  I had a mussels appetizer that came with crusty bread and it served as a meal for me.  Absolutely delicious.  This is a great placed to meet professional people as well."}
{"text":"The food at Eno Vino is exceptional, and once inside the strip-mall doors, the decor of this place is warm and elegant and not too crowded the night we reserved.  We came here for a celebration dinner after touring the U of W Grad School offices and it was an excellent choice.    The small plates selection was impressive!  We started with the baby spinach salad with figs, proscuitto, pistachios, and maple vinegar. It was certainly one of the best plates of the evening. Next we had the blackened mahi-mahi with mango butter and butternut jicama slaw. Perfectly done, melt-in your-mouth goodness.  My partner loved the lamb cheek sugo with caramelized fennel and feta, and I liked it too, even though I'm not a big fan of lamb. It came with a delicious herbed spaeztle. It's great to start seeing these noodles on restaurant menus!  Our last dish was a portabella mushroom ravioli with port wine cream and brandy-cured foie gras. It was spectacular. If we'd had any room, I would have ordered a second one, but the portions are ample and we were full.  Joe enjoyed a Picos del Montgo Tempranillo, from Spain, and a Sherwood Pinot Noir, from New Zealand. He loved both of them. I was happy with my Cavas but glad for a taste out of each of his glasses.  Altogether, it was a wonderful dinner - great food and a nice romantic evening. The only thing that marred it slightly was our server, who had an excess of personality and not enough work to do. He was a little obtrusive, but also knew the menu well and made excellent wine suggestions."}
{"text":"Eno Vino is really excellent. I've been twice this week so I guess that's saying something.  They have a great wine list to choose from, both by the glass and from the cellar--which is presented on an iPad. A very nice full bar to boot, which in my book means a good selection of scotches.  The food is great, but remember that it is presented in an appetizer or tapas like form. My favorite dish that I tried was the Ahi Tacos--had to have it again on the second visit.   Highly recommended. Just keep in mind that I think Eno Vino fits more of the \"great place to meet people\" than the \"great place for a sit down dinner\" category."}
{"text":"We always love this place.  Some nights it is packed and energetic and some night's not.  This past Saturday was not, likely because of the nice summer weather.  We enjoy the wine selection, appetizers, and tapas style dining.  It is very fun to order many options and share them around the table.  Be ready for lots of taste bud tantalization!  This most recent visit we took our friends from the Chicago area.  We wondered how we could impress them with all the choices they must have in a big city.  They were impressed.  Open table reservation made it very easy to book in advance on my phone.  This place is a must for your list if you have not yet visited."}
{"text":"Been there 4 times, gotten worse every time.  Definitely don't go on a Sunday, they were out of several menu items but we didn't find out until about 15 minutes after we originally ordered. Service was meh, still up in the air about whether or not we will ever go back"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some cocktails during happy hour. We hung out in the lounge area around the bar. Our drinks were amazing and so was the goat cheese starter.  The place is dark inside but not in a bad way. The wait staff was pleasant and attentive. We also forgot our iPhone there for about 3 hours. Through gps tracking we found it was still at the restaurant. Our waitress must have found it and put it in the hostess desk for if we came back looking for it.  Can't wait to come back for another Lychee Martini"}
{"text":"Food: 5 Service: 3 Uniqueness: 5  ----------------- This is arguably my wife's favorite Madison restaurant.   The food is insanely good with some unique menu items you're not going to get anywhere else. The Korean Short Rib Potstickers is a one-of-a-kind insanely delicious item! There are other really unique reinventions of things as well like the ahi tuna tacos and the pork belly over a biscuit that are just delicious.  The one minus to Eno Vino is the service can be at times poor with some of the wait staff slightly pretentious. I say that based on only 2 or 3 experiences on more than half a dozen trips so take that with a grain of salt.  This is definitely a place you want to try out for a fancy night out or a special occasion."}
{"text":"Finally a fine dining restaurant in Madison worth its salt!! This was my first time here so won't get too superlative with praises but well done!  Decor - Eclectic with a beautiful dim light romantic shade to it. The seating's were thankfully away from the Bar thus helping with noise reduction.  Service - Spot on!! The waitress was very sweet and knew her dishes well. Every dish was explained properly, our order was taken in the right way and she kept checking in on us every once in a while.   Food - Seductively Sumptuous!! Every plate we ordered had its own unique identity and no 2 plates conflicted with each other. Our order included - Ahi Tuna Tacos, Labelle Farm Fois Gras, Braised Belly, Korean Short Rib Pot-stickers. The tuna tacos were sooo playful with their fresh tuna pairing with a spicy-tangy jalapeno slaw. The tomato relish complimented both the subtlety of the tuna and the spiciness of the slaw. Loved it!  The fois gras was delectable!  Cooked just right, it melted away as it's meant to and when accompanied with the green apples and fig jam, creates a melody in your mouth!! The toast were thankfully moist and not crusty or crunchy and that worked very well overall.  The braised belly was a surprise!! Every single element on that dish was a star! The egg perfectly runny, the belly seasoned well, seared to perfection and melt in your mouth texture, the tomato confit really enhanced the tomato flavor and that gouda biscuit was one of the best biscuits I've had in a while! Work them together and it became a dish well worth a round of applause!!  The potstickers can be a tricky subject since I'm not a big fan of thick casings. These however, were  just right and that short rib filling was a pleasant departure from your bog standard mince pork or shrimp fillings. The pairing of Mayo, Soy and hot sauce with it really uplifted the dish.  I saved the best for last. It's their Creme Brulee dessert. But it's not about the food that makes it the best, but their gesture. Don't get me wrong, that was one of the best Creme Brulee's I've ever had (Never imagined pairing creme brulee with brownie and raspberry compote will go so well!!!). It was my birthday and we had asked if they could place a small candle on the dish when they get it out. Not only did they do that, they painstakingly wrote a sweet Happy Birthday message for me! AND gave me the dessert on the house!!!! No one has ever done that in any of the places I've dined. Very very kind of them.  This is at the top of my list of go to restaurants for Round 2 in Madison. Please do give them a try and I'm sure you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The service here is on point!  In addition to our attentive server, the service manager was definitely on the floor and making sure customers are taken care of.  I think the service is the most notable thing about this restaurant.  You can bring a group of people here and feel certain that they will have a pleasant time.  Restrooms are classy.  When the ladies' room has lotion, mints, and brand name tampons, you know you are in a place where staff pays attention to details.  Wine list.  I'm not a wine expert by any means, but they have iPads for learning more about their selections as well as offering a full bar, of course.  I had a sparkling red wine, which is kinda crazy.  The food is good, but not memorable.  Everything is oriented towards leisurely snacking, so you can feel comfortable ordering 1-2 things at a time and sharing.  This is a great option if you want to relax  at a place a little more high end than a coffeeshop with a small group."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a work get together and while the company was great, the food definitely left me wanting more.  The menu is built around small plates with flatbreads and some larger dishes to choose from.  As we were part of a group, we tried two flatbreads-Thai Chicken and the Shrimp and Andouille, truffle fries, chicken skewers, calamari fries, bruschetta, and the seared sesame ahi.  Much to choose from but all were utterly unremarkable.  Nothing stood out.  Flavors didn't pop.  It was not the Eno Vino that I am used to.  Admittedly, I havent been there in over a year but perhaps now having two locations has impacted their attention to detail and execution.  They offer a large number of wines by the glass and their Super Tuscan was tasty.  Service was great for our table of 8 but I would definitely have to have my arm twisted to come back to dine again."}
{"text":"I adore Eno Vino. It can be a little on the pricey side depending on what you get. I love coming in when the wine bottles are half off and sharing a cheese board and one or two other random things with my boyfriend. It usually ends up being fairly priced and definitely filling.  The biggest downside to this place is the portion size. Everything is tiny. If you're looking for filling and aren't interested in the cheese board or spending a lot of money then this place isn't for you. I will say that what the dishes lack in size they almost always make up for in flavor. I've never been disappointed with a single thing I've gotten here.  I love the low lights and decor. I do miss the recent attention to the restrooms. I miss being able to get a quick spritz of Aveda hairspray before leaving. Any place that offers products, especially Aveda quality, in the restrooms wins my heart. I hope you bring it back, Eno Vino!  The wine selection is amazing. I tend not to be too adventurous when ordering at a restaurant, but there is enough of a selection to please any wine enthusiast.   The service is always amazing. Every waitress here is incredibly nice and friendly.  I would recommend anyone stop in here at least once. It may not be the place you go every week, but it will definitely end up being one of your favorite places."}
{"text":"Great place and fun time sharing and tasting all the great freshly prept food! Headed there Sat for the potstickers and mushroom ravioli :)) yum"}
{"text":"I came here to try the entrees for the first time, and I am happily surprised how much I enjoyed them. The first time I came here, I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either; I just didn't have much to say. Coming here for father's day weekend, my family was impressed and I was proud to have taken them to a restaurant they enjoyed so much.  My father loved how relaxed the environment was. We sat on the couches and sipped wine and munched on truffle fries and bruschetta while watching golf on the TV. The service was wonderful, and our server checked on us frequently and refilled our waters. Our favorite bruschetta was the beef tenderloin (we substituted the choice cheese with goat cheese - YUM!). Truffle fries? A-D-D-I-C-T-I-V-E!! We had to ask our server to box them up because we just could not stop eating.   My father ordered the pork belly, my mother: the scallops, and my boyfriend: the duck confit spring rolls. Pork belly: absolutely amazing. Pork fell apart and melted in your mouth, and the bread pairing was perfect. Scallops: I can honestly say I've had better for cheaper. It was tasty, but I don't think I can say it was worth the $27. Spring rolls: I did not enjoy one bit, but my boyfriend loved them. I personally thought they tasted a bit fishy, and my boyfriend claimed he would come back for them. In the end, we all shared the peach cobbler with ice cream on the side. Cobbler without the ice cream was pretty dry, but very delicious overall.  Overall, a very successful dinner. I am willing to come back. A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to both this Eno Vino and the one by the capitol. We were seated in a corner area. Just like at the other Eno Vino, we ordered the calamari fries and truffle fries. We also ordered a seared scallop/sea bass and a squid-ink linguine. Everything was absolutely delicious, as always. I would say that Eno Vino handles seafood perfectly; the calamari fries are always hot and crispy. The scallop was seared to perfection and the sea bass melted in your mouth. The squid ink linguini was also delicious and there was a generous portion of clams and mussels in the dish. SO ordered a blueberry mule. He said it was tasty and refreshing.   There were two things that I wish were different. The first was we were the only table that did not receive any bread (probably just a minor oversight) and by the time we noticed, it was already into the meal. Not a big deal.  The other minor gripe I have is that this is not a place you go to if you are not prepared to spend a pretty penny. I understand that quality is what they go for, but for around $30, one scallop and a small piece of fish really was a little disappointing; I could have easily eaten 4-5 of those and still have been hungry (I wish dishes at that price point came with a little something extra, such as a bed of risotto or some mashed potatoes). Also, as a place that boasted \"plates to share\", dishes such as those really are hard to share.   Definitely come here for quality and delicious food, but be prepared to pay."}
{"text":"Went for birthday dinner for five people, super busy Friday night around 7:30 pm. Service was outstanding and tried a plethora of dishes, all were spot on."}
{"text":"Sample some wines before you commit to one and then stay the night munching and sipping.  Liked it a lot.  Very expensive.  Very trendy/hip.  Great people-watching.  Loud.  Disappointed with the pork belly after reading so many great things here."}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience I had while visiting the Madison area. It is a tapas bar, but I should note that it is not Spanish cuisine but more like a fusion of different cuisines. We came with  group of 10 and at first I thought that would not work out with the sharing. It actually worked out great and everyone ended up with full and happy bellies. Here is my ratings of the dishes we tried.  Absolute Must try: -Sea bass and scallops: my favorite of all, delicious and perfectly cooked. It is also the most expensive dish on the menu ($28) and probably least appropriate for sharing with a large group since it's only 2 scallops and a very small piece of fish. -Calamari fries: best calamari ever!! not the round and chewy calamri you might be used to, this was very tender and yummy. -Hanger steak: great and served with risotto. -Blackened mahi-mahi: this was the favorite of the table, we had to order an extra since we wanted more -Ahi Poke: very refreshing and satisfying if you like seaweed and raw tuna  Also very good: -Thai chicken pizza -Chicken skewers -Fries -Crab cake (very small and you only get 2, though)  Stay away: -Gnocchi and veal meatball: very mushy gnocchi, meatballs were nothing special -Cheese plate: for $11 you get 2 very tiny cheese wedges, not worth it with all the other great otions"}
{"text":"Nice place with good food.  I've only been there once and it was with a very large party.  We shared a ton of different things and I liked them all.  I suppose I'm comparing this place to some pretty famous tapas restaurants in Chicago.  This wasn't as good, but it's a nice atmosphere with good food and I'd happily eat there again."}
{"text":"Best upscale restaurant on the west side of Madison. Love the electronica music. Was a wonderful place for my birthday and we've gone with groups which was fun as well. I always wear earplugs because it gets busy and noisy. We eat in the restaurant and they serve tapas. Kind of pricey but always worth it. The dishes are served architecture style--very decorative and arty. The comment about this being the place to take a woman if you want a second or third date is true!"}
{"text":"I worked at Eno Vino as a waitress for just shy of three years.  It is a tapas bistro, meaning there is a large number of small dishes that you can choose for everyone at the table to share. It's decidedly pricey if you wind up doing any real eating rather than just drinking, so it's better for a luxurious evening out if that's your style. The wine list is extremely serious. Prices for wine, however, are actually very reasonable, both by the bottle and glass; you'll find that most restaurants in town sell the same bottles for more. Moreover, alhough I do not drink martinis myself they always looked darned impressive when I served them. Lots of frou frou and pointy, exciting garnish awaits you at Eno Vino.  The restaurant has changed since I worked there from a half-bar, half-restaurant to much more of a bar. You can still get dinner there, but you might want to pick a quiet evening. The bar is a zoo on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've modified this post several times over the years. It's gone from extremely detailed and enthusiastic to just enthusiastic. Eno Vino is a lovely place, but I haven't worked there since early 2008 so I'm not too clear on the details anymore as the menu and wine list have changed a good bit. I guess one of the best recommendations is that I still go there even after working there for so long. We had our bickering and in house tension like you have at all restaurants: server on server rage, chef on chef rage, owner on owner rage, manager on manager rage, bartender on bartender rage, and all the combos thereof. But in retrospect, I realize that this was probably because Eno was and is a really good restaurant. They hired smart (if occasionally vicious) people, all of whom really cared about their jobs and worked their asses off every night. So what else is new in the restaurant biz, right? Bottom line, the food was unbelievable and we all really cared about how our tables turned out. And that's still the case - the quality of food and service at Eno Vino are unmatched in Madison.   For me, I think it's the tomato soup that keeps me coming back. I ate it pretty much every night before my shift (cheapest thing on the menu) and now for me it's the flavor of my absurdly hardworking, high-living youth. Why did I have to quit? Oh right, because I wanted to become a doctor and so my adviser made me, and rightly so. But now that I actually AM a doctor I do miss being a waitress once in awhile, even if the interpersonal dynamics did leave something to be desired. I guess humans can be nostalgic about just about anything, given a reasonable supply of the right soup. I am going to get a bowl of that soup right now. It comes with truffled microgreens and a tiny grilled cheese sandwich. It is foolishly delicious. You had better try it before you die, although it won't mean the same thing to you that it does to me.  Also: the scallops are occasionally (not always - but sometimes) the size of hockey pucks. That is all."}
{"text":"Coming into this I wasn't expecting much.  My buddy questioned why I'm going for wine when Wisconsin is known for beer and dairy.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the great food, service, and atmosphere. The tapas style here is perfect for sharing for groups of 2-3.  Every item we tried was enjoyable - Truffled fries - mixed bruschetta - sea bass & scallop - hanger steak & cheddar risotto - thai chicken flat bread - creme brulee  The martinis were a little on sweet side but strong.  The server was enthusiastic, friendly and informative without being overbearing.  I'm glad to have found this gem.  (avg $50-60 a pop with drinks, tax & tip)"}
{"text":"We have had dinner at Eno Vino on Junction Road many times in the past. It's our go-to place when folks come in from out of town, birthdays, and sometimes--just because. It's not the cheapest place, but if the food is good and one is treated well, it's worth it. And we've had many evenings there with servers who took great care of us. So imagine our surprise when we went recently for my birthday, and the service was just meh. I am a person who likes birthdays--mine and others. I had noted on the reservation that we were there for a birthday. I also told our server. She didn't remark on it more than \"oh.\" I wasn't expecting a free anything, but a happy birthday or even a candle in our dessert would've been nice. Nothing, nada, zip. Our server was polite, but not warm. She was helpful in suggesting dishes but didn't check on us once they came, and it was not a busy night. In fact, I had to ask for a new fork at one point, while she was standing up next to the bar talking to the Asst. Manager. In addition, we ordered the pear tart for dessert, and she bought spoons to eat it with--the tart had a crust that one could not cut through easily with a spoon. We couldn't get her attention, so we just took forks from the table next to us that was set. So maybe this was an off night--that's what I'm hoping--but we may give them a little break for a while."}
{"text":"I've been both here and their capitol location. They have very different atmospheres based on what you are looking for. This EnoVino is more of a restaurant style sit down kind of place. It is much quieter and more refined in my opinion. Take that as you will.  We ordered a couple drinks and had scallop as well as squid ink linguine. I am always craving seafood so this was a godsend. The scallop was perfectly cooked. Everything about this place is so good (except for the price)!"}
{"text":"It pains me to update my review to 3-stars from 5-stars. I considered dropping my review to 2-stars but based on the many years of great service and a fantastic menu I'll give Eno Vino a bit of leeway.   The service has gotten unreliable ever since the opening of their downtown location. On our last several visits menu items were not available and on or last visit we weren't told this until 1/2 of our order arrived. This created the awkward situation of one of his having food in front of them and the other with nothing. So one of us just did without.   Frankly after years of loyal patronage this is all pretty disappointing. When Eno Vino is on point, it'll be a great experience - but when they aren't - we'll it'll be disappointing."}
{"text":"It was good but a tad slow. Had a bunch of different items however I only remember the flat bread (sausage and mushroom) which was ok but memorable for the over cooked crust that was hard as a rock. Otherwise food was fine but nothing special."}
{"text":"Service, food and libations are off-the-hook good.  This place rivals tapas restaurants in San Francisco and NYC.  Seriously. It's that good."}
{"text":"Found one of my favorite wines here: Paul Mas Malbec is delicious. Tapas also delicious, and makes for a great date spot. Nice ambiance, great wine, good food."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that this place was lucky to get one star, and it only got one star because 1) Yelp doesn't let reviewers give zero stars and 2) the wine was good.  That being said, the food here was terrible.  In fact, I was shocked that Eno Vino had 4.5 stars on Yelp, but then I listened to the other diners around us and I'm pretty sure that their palattes weren't exactly sophisticated.  Case in point, the woman behind me asked the waiter if the pork belly was really intestines.  When he explained what pork belly was, she seemed incredibly impressed.  In fact, she even said, \"Fancy!\" in a completely non-sarcastic way.  So maybe Eno Vino has an overly inflated rating on Yelp because its diners think the food is \"fancy\" and don't know how well-prepared \"fancy\" food like pork belly should actually taste?  Who knows.  Moving on to the food.  We ordered the following items: the lobster bisque, the tempura shrimp, the pork belly, and the duck confit risotto.  Let's start with the least offensive, which was the shrimp.  It was similar to tempura carry out from the corner Chinese place.  Not terrible, but nothing to make it really stand out.  It was essentially just decent fried shrimp.    Now things start getting offensive.  Let's begin with the pork belly.  It came topped with a soft cooked egg.  Our server made it a point to explain that the dish was presented with the egg on top for a reason - so the diner could cut into the egg and break the yolk so the runny yolk would infuse with the rest of the dish.  She emphasized how much the yolk complemented the rest of the dish.  I get it.  I love a runny yolk.  It's one of the reason I orderd the dish.  I was thinking eggs and bacon.  So you can imagine my surprise when I cut into the egg to find a hard cooked yolk.  Huh.  If that was all that was wrong with the dish, I could have at least forgotten about the egg and enjoyed the pork belly.  Unfortunately it was also covered in a congealed and unappetizing mornay sauce, which had clearly spent too much time on the warmer back in the kitchen.  Mornay sauce really isn't that hard to make, and for the prices Eno Vino charges, I'd expect it to be made to order.  Speaking of things that should be made to order, let's talk about the duck confit risotto.  Or, as it turned out to be, a slightly brown tasteless gluey mess with nuggets of duck.  Risotto should be creamy and just a little toothsome.  However, just like the mornay sauce and the egg in the pork belly dish, the risotto had clearly been made WELL ahead of time and warmed up.  It was mushy, gelatinous, and gluey.   No texture.  Plus it was incredibly bland.  Two thumbs down.  Time to discuss the most offensive dish of the night.  The lobster bisque.  I love lobster bisque.  It's rich, it's decadent, it's sweet and savory.  It's wonderful.  However, the lobster bisque at Eno Vino is some kind of Frankenstein bastard hybrid of canned turkey gravy and seafood stock base from a jar.  For one thing, lobster bisque should be creamy pinkish orange in color.  Not brown like turkey gravy, which is what the bisque at Eno Vino was.  I gave the bisque the benefit of the doubt and thought that perhaps the chef was trying to add depth of flavor by incorporating a dark roux.  Nope.  The bisque tasted and had the consistency of fishy canned gravy.  It also came with rubbery overcooked *crab* legs, which was interesting since it was *lobster* bisque.  But I digress.  The bisque was a fail of epic proportions.    To add insult to injury, this meal, along with a couple glasses of wine for my husband and I, still added up to about $100.  I could have complained about the crap food to my server, but what was the point?  My server recommended some of these things, so she obviously wouldn't know good food if it jumped up and bit her in the behind.  I learned my very expensive lesson at Eno Vino.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"My partner took me here six years ago for a first date.  I eventually brought her here to ask her to marry  me.  The atmosphere is intoxicating, yet exuberant. Romantic, yet still exciting. The open kitchen can transform their customers into their audience.  The wine list alone is the draw. But the food will have you coming back for years.  I want to point out that their goat cheese in marinara is my least favorite app. Not worth the $9. The fact that I value their $11 truffled fries should say something.  I've tried seafood throughout Madison. I've enjoyed lobster in Maine, Patagonian toothfish in New York, crab in New Orleans and clams in San Francisco. And yet the Day Boat Scallops here at Eno Vino continue to be one of my favorite dishes. Not better than others, but best among dishes in the area.  The duck confit is en pointe; the hanger steak (rare) is delicious...Just enjoy yourself at this lovely restaurant in Middleton."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and yummy food! My favorite on the menu is the Hearth Oven Flatbread with Spicy Shrimp And Andouille jalape√±o cream, roasted peppers and mozzarella- absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Italian-style restaurant for small plates.  The hostess us greeted with a smile. Nice, cozy decor. Romantic atmosphere. Great, friendly service. Ordered the cheese board with choice of 4 cheeses. Absolutely fantastic.  Also ordered the scallops. In a word, amazing. They were fresh and tender, not rubbery, full of flavor.  The manager came by to check on us which is always appreciated.  The only thing that threw me off is the ipad for the wine list. To me, it's just.....wrong. The ipad doesn't fit the ambiance or the mood of the place.  Very happy with the quality of the food, the service, the speed, and the overall experience. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was and still am very impressed with the food,wine selection, an great service @Eno vino, A very nice greeting and host to start it off, Very classy darkly lit atmophere sets the mood while deliciously wonderful smells fill the room.  Service was second to none. Personal ipad for the wine selection makes for a easy and tech savey way to browse they're magnificiant wine selection. As for the food ,every single dish has its own uniqe flavor , with each dish you are set on \" this is my favorite\" but as the next plate comes you realize \"wait no this is my favorite\". The price is jus right,maybe alittle pricey for some but you definently get what yu pay for that's forsure.The service is very knowledgeable and very helpful.To me its what classy resturaunt should be. One of my favorite places in WI.Id definently recomend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute must try!!!! If you like innovative food, more selections of wine than you can count, great signature drinks, and top notch service, not to mention the ambiance is great for a girls night out or a definite date night, You must try Eno Vino...My boyfriend and I are regulars here and love, love, love it!!!"}
{"text":"Well .....I had a lot of expectations as I remember this place as \"great\" This visit was not \"great\" Not at all Brochuta- good Plus  The special duck - excellent Taco Tuna - not \"very good\" Ahi tuna - very very good Sangeria - well.....1/2 cheap win with 1/2 water and slice of watermelon doesn't do the job. It was poor - very poor.  Service? What just happen here! We arrived - no one is waiting in the entrance .... We had to ask to replace the plates. It's obvious when you eat tapas style - no? Not here! And - I had special request for Birthday cake - but no one bother to take care of it.  I remember this restaurant as 5 stars. But this visit was maybe 3 stars - also the price remain at 5 stars level.  In one word: disappointed"}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner tonight.  The cheese tray was great, and so were the truffle fries.  The crab cakes were small for the price.  Everyone enjoyed the chicken skewers.   Was surprised how cold it was and how empty. There were small things they could have done to make things better for our large party like bringing two little plates the toasts instead of a single plate down at one end.  I will say that everyone enjoyed what they ordered so small improvements could greatly improve my rating."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I wasn't excited about the idea of going to Eno Vino.  I'm not really a Tapas kind of guy as I picture a fufu plate with already small servings that I now have to share.  My wife suggested it many times and I regularly leaned against it.  Wow, what a bone-headed move that was...I've unfortunately been missing out on something great.  I found myself enjoying each plate that we ordered.  I found the flavors were original and complex and really did enjoy it.  We ordered three main items, the bruschetta, chicken on sticks (my term, not theirs), and Pork Belly.  In addition to these items, the bread / garlic butter that is served with the meal was also great.  We also had the Red Velvet cake for dessert, which was also good.  When we were leaving, my wife said we should come here more often and I responded with \"how about next Friday\".  I walked away full and excited about this new found dinner destination."}
{"text":"Very unique Italian Tapas & Vino restaurant.   Liked the wine list on an iPad, quartino servings in a wobbly glass and cocktail list (particularly the Gin Yummy).  The server recommended 2 dishes per person, but I'd say you really need 1 1/2.  Easy to share.  We ordered 9 different dishes and  enjoyed the flank steak, bacon fries and goat cheese appetizer the best!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Eno Vino since it opened.  If you are looking for a top notch wine bar this is the place to go.  They sell more wine than any other bar/restaurant in Madison.  They have a huge selection that can't be matched anywhere else.  The food is exceptional compared to most places in Madison.  I'm suprised to hear people have complaints about the food.  I have dined here hundreds of times and if you want my suggestions on small plates that will never let you down try these: 1)  Seared Sesame Tuna 2)  Sea Bass and Scallops 3)  Thai Chicken Flatbread 4) Littleneck Clams Give this place a try and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"I always forget how much I enjoy Eno Vino. The food is a good take on modern American bistro cuisine, and they always have a decent number of gluten-free selections on their menu. Their waitstaff is friendly and attentive, without being overly so, and knowledgable.  Most of the time, my friends and I each order a couple of the small plates and share everything (their \"small plates\" are not always \"small\" - the value for price is good here.)  One of my favorite items on the menu is the pork shank. It's fall-off-the-bone tender, all on a bed of napa cabbage, a cranberry agrodolce (sweet & sour sauce) and topped off with fried lentils for a nice crunch.  Noise level varies depending on when you're there -- Friday and Saturday nights (when I most often go) tend to be on the louder side, especially after 7pm.  My only request is that they stop eliminating GF options when they change up their menu -- we want more options, not less! A GF bread option, so I could order bruschetta, or their flatbreads, would also be nice. (I'd be happy to pay a small surcharge for the option.)"}
{"text":"The food here is superb. I've tried almost every vegetarian/ pescetarian item on the menu and they're all delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything they serve here.  My only complaint is that the menu isn't really well designed? Like it's a little hard to read and navigate and kind of challenging to find what I'm looking for. Other than that, the decor is very modern and upscale and the service is excellent. Slightly fancier than casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am fortunately to live so close to such a delightful tapas wine bar. Anytime I don't feel like cooking or going out for an elaborate meal (yes, sometimes I'm too lazy to eat), I find myself here, and i order the same three items every time: the lobster bisque, mushroom ravioli, sea bass and scallops.  The quality of the food, from its ingredients, recipe, to its execution, is flawless. They're especially adapt at cooking seafood. The sea bass and scallops are always cooked to perfection - a little crisp on the outside with a buttery mouthfeel. It's orgasmic.   If you have kids, I recommend the mushroom ravioli. It's topped with a port wine reduction and truffle oil. My 4 yo can't get enough of that stuff.   I haven't explored their wine list as every time I go it's lazy mom's night with the kid, but if any fellow yelpers have recommendations for a good, full bodied red, please let me know!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only been for the drinks, and I've never sampled the food.  On the drinks alone, this place gets two stars.  The mixed drinks are weak, albeit pretty good tasting.  I've sampled a number of different drinks, and none blew me away.  The happy hour prices are a nice deal (all day sundays, m-f 4-7).  You get $2 off wines by the glass and $ 2 off \"modest sippers.\"  There are also food deals.    ****One big annoyance....which is a minor thing, but unbelievably stupid policy on their part.... they don't \"do\" happy hour if you want to sit outside.....WHY?!  You have a large outdoor seating area (which looks out on the parking lot....), but you won't give the $2 off drinks outside....I've thought about it, and I just don't get the policy here.  Is it really not worth your time to just have a server walk the extra 10 feet outside?  It just seems stingy.  If i'm paying four bucks for your watered down sugar drinks, just let me enjoy it outside as I admire the all those pretty cars that your upscale wine bar looks out on.  This place is filling the classy, wine bar niche in the otherwise beer-saturated Madison.  If you're looking at exploring some wines, and have some cash, give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Nice service at the bar and happy hour all day Sunday!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and liked it both times. The salads and flatbreads are good. Tapas - the ahi poke and the hangar steak are good. Tried the jean-luc colombo chateauneuf-du-pape which was excellent."}
{"text":"We have visited enoVino before and always loved it. One night we came and it was pretty disappointing. Food was salty, no better than a chain restaurant. We had always loved the bruschetta options, but this night we get like we spent $16 on 4 pieces of toast with barely any toppings. Service was very nice, but I'm afraid that the food was so bad for the cost that I can't imagine we will ever return. Time to find a new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Eno Vino--it's definitely on par with some of my favorite Chicago hotspots. My sister and I went for some good old fashioned liquid dessert, aka Key Lime Pie martinis. We also shared the cheese plate: warm Fontina fondue, along with aged goat, blue, cheddar and gouda cheeses, and the Shitaki Ravioli, which featured a really nice Foie Gras sauce -- yum!  Note that they're currently undergoing construction due to expansion; we ended up perched on stools at the bar next to a very large tarp, but didn't notice any noise or drafty conditions. And yes, as some other reviewers mentioned, the strip mall location is somewhat disconcerting, but two drinks in you'll forget all about the neighboring Jiffy-Lube."}
{"text":"Excellent and nicely plated food. Most of our dishes were exceptionally tasty (though the dumplings were merely good). A few of the small plates (e.g., grilled octopus) were so meager that sharing was impractical - even though the menu header states \"to share\" and the prices suggest a more generous portion.  Considering this is a wine bar, the staff seemed lacking in knowledge on their wines. Recommend."}
{"text":"I get to Madison a couple times a year and we are always looking for a new place to run up the expense account.  Eno Vino can certainly deliver a pretty swanky meal.  We had a couple of good bottles of wine accompanied by some great dishes.  As others have said the beef tenderloin was awesome as was the Sesame Tuna.  What confused me a little was the portion size.  We asked our server if the servings were really a tapas style, small plate type of thing and she said yes, order 2-3 small plates per person.  We ended up with way too much food, the servings were pretty good sized.  I am use to tapas being very small plates and sharing them with the table.  This place seems to have almost entry sized portions.  I would suggest ordering a couple to get started and then placing another order if you are style hungry."}
{"text":"Their Sea Bass and Scallop dish with verjus is the best thing I've ever eaten. Two words: Tomato Jam.   It is not cheap, but worth the money. I look forward to returning and highly recommend it.   I tried foie gras for the first time ever and was impressed. Both times I have been here (had the Sea Bass and Scallop dish both times... it's THAT good) we tried a cheese plate. The first time we asked our server what kind was good and she suggested the Bellavitano. I still feel like I owe her for this. A friend and I joke that Bellavitano brings people together.The second time we had that and the Moody Blue. Also a find.   If you are looking for a quality, delicious dinner and are not concerned with the price, Eno Vino is your answer."}
{"text":"As the author of the Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs, I travel a lot doing consulting and eat out a lot. I've eaten at the bar, at a table at the chef's table and again at the chef's table at this restaurant. WOW. Great meals and awesome service 4 times now. Love any of their scallop dishes, fish is great and I probably will go back on Friday. It's rare that someone in such a busy place remembers your name, but I returned with a business client and there was the manager Jennifer welcoming me back and remembering my name! When I sat at the chef's table, two of the waitresses also said hi and remembered my name as well. It's smart to get a reservation as it is busy, but any effort you make is well worth it. The only thing I haven't tried is dessert, but they also have a strong selection of ports and other after dinner drinks. Make the time to visit--I bet you'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Fun atmosphere, great wine list and incredible food! The one thing I always order to start out with is the bruschetta, it's the best I've had anywhere. The braised pork ribs are also excellent and if the duck confit crepes are on the menu, you MUST order them. I've been here three times and each time was a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"If you've read more than a handful of Yelp reviews, you've probably run across at least one review that starts out with \" I really wanted to like this place more\".  Fear not gentle reader, this is not one of those reviews.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  I like this place more than I feel I should.  Despite being housed in a west side strip mall, despite no information on the sourcing of their ingredients, despite the bizarre fusion of wine bar and sports bar elements, I keep coming back.  Why, you ask?  They offer creative food with exceptional service in an intimate setting  Every time I've visited, my wife and I have left content.  And there are very few places in Madison that I can say that about.  Things I like:  * Want to feel like a rock star? The attentive service at Eno Vino will make you feel like one.  The entire staff really seems focused on creating the best possible experience for the patrons.  More than anything else, this is keeps drawing me back.   * I adore the humble simplicity of the Charred Hot House Tomato Soup.  It may be the lowest priced item on the menu, but this dish never fails to amaze.  Intense tomato flavor that is perfectly complimented by a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Highly recommended!   * A wine list that's twelve freakin' pages long.  It has a great mix of varietals and regions.  If you feel overwhelmed by all the choices, the servers and bartenders have offered some great recommendations.  I also recommend utilizing the wine flights as a way to sample some out of the ordinary.   *  I appreciate the wide variety of menu choices.  Usually I get nervous when I see a wide variety of cuisines represented on the menu.  But kitchen at Eno Vno does a pretty decent job of representing the various cuisines of Asia, Europe and the Americas. When I have a disappointing dish, it's more the result of poor execution than of poor concept.     * Overall, I enjoy the ambiance.  Once I enter, I immediately forget that I'm in a strip mall.  Romantic lighting levels, the fireplace by the bar, the warm color palette of the decor make it a great date night location.  While others have complained about the noise level, I've never experienced that problem when seated at the the chef's table or the bar area.    Things I don't like:  * Black hole, meet wallet.  A couple glasses of wine, several appetizers and a dessert will likely set you back $100.  Eno Vino adheres to a quality over quantity philosophy, which you'll noticed when it comes time to pay the bill.   * For a restaurant that focuses on food quality, I'm surprised they don't indicate where they are sourcing their ingredients.  They may adhere to a farm-to-table philosophy like many of the other finer, local dining establishments, but the menu or the website does not shed any insights.  When I go to Graze, I know exactly where the items on the cheese board came from, not so at Eno Vino.   * For the love of god, ditch the TVs in the bar area.  Do you really think showing SportsCenter adds to the ambiance?  I didn't think so.   * I'm surprised there haven't been more road rage incidents in the parking lot as the strip mall patrons race each other to find an open parking spot.  Be prepared to spend time hunting for a parking spot.  Despite these imperfections, I still am a huge fan of Eno Vino."}
{"text":"A huge thank you to the wonderful Eno staff for hosting Yelp's Social Hour this week.  I had a fabulous time (kicking my friend's butt at the one-person tricky triangle game..harhar) trying out the Happy Hour menu and enjoying the relaxing, buzz-happy atmosphere.  The food was fantastic. For a wine bar, Eno definitely has all the finger food-y goodness of a neighborhood pub - but with three times the class and five times the number of items on the menu. ;) My friends and I split the calamari and the spicy shrimp & andouille pizza. My friends ravedddd about the calamari, but I think I was mostly amused by the shape of the calamari fries. I was actually much more impressed by the combination of seafood and sausage on the pizza.  I also ordered the strawberry&peach fresh enofusion martini. I probably drank it much faster than I should have - seriously, an adult beverage in a...martini glass shaped.... juice box.  The service was extremely attentive and patient (i always take forever to decide on menu items at a new place..). Plus, I can always appreciate a restaurant manager who greets their regulars by name. (:   I will definitely be back to try out the full menu. See you soon, Eno!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine. Wish the wine flights would change more frequently! Friendly staff! Thai chicken pizza and sesame seared tuna are amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Eno Vino dozens of times now and it's always the first place that comes to mind when I want to grab an awesome drink or bite to eat.  I adore their drinks: The All Natural martini is my go to, but I love the PB&J and Blueberry Cobbler too.  My bf and I generally always start with the Ahi Tuna, but recently have moved to their awesome mussels.  They change up their menu every so often and I am never disappointed when they do.  We went a few days ago and had their duck special and it was AMAZING.  I always get the scallops and would happily eat them everyday if I could.  Their hanger steak is a must too, the mashed potatoes underneath are awesome.  The waitstaff is always very knowledgeable and prompt.  We generally finish up with the fondue and I somehow always have enough room to finish it.  It's a little spendy but I feel like you get so much amazing food that it's well worth it.  The decor and seating is great too.  I have no complaints about Eno, I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I found Eno Vino on the last day of my trip to Madison for work and had I known about it before, I would have been here every night.  Their happy our is amazing!  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about the wine list and menu and kind.  The food was delicious.  My friends and I shared too many plates to name but I highly recommend the ahi tuna tacos, truffle fries, thai chicken pizza and the Magdelena Zinfandel."}
{"text":"Way fun, way yummy, way fancy.  In the arena of fine dining in Madison, this place is one of those outliers that is not right next to the capitol.  It is about 8 miles west in Middleton.  My mother swooped into town to ease my broken heart.  An evening at Eno Vino with my mom and a gf fit the bill....well it didn't hurt.  Taste buds dance in delight, food looks like art, and you just melt into your seat.  Get the fondue thing for dessert. Swoon. See pic."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I expect great food in Chicago, but you guys in Wisconsin are keeping secrets over here! Between an appetizer with baked goat cheese and basil and an entree of scallops and black figs atop slices of French toast soaked in truffle butter, you have pretty much covered all my favorite foods. The Sage Advice mixed drink was OUTSTANDING as well. Kudos! I will be back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"This used to me our favorite restaurant in Madison. We were in college and this was the place to celebrate special occasions and have many good memories in this restaurant. We even returned few years after college and still loved it.   Atmosphere (4/5): Many different types or seating  completely open kitchen which feels good. Fancy and classic at that time. I don't know how it would feel now since last time we visited was about 3-4 years ago.   Service (5/5): Always their server was so friendly and nice. We remembered our favorite server's name for a while. Sometimes the manager came by and asked about food which was nice. Always good experience and cannot complain on this.   Food (5/5): wanted to give 4.5 but I kind of have to give five. Current menu doesn't have many items we used to like. Their fried calamari was definitely best ever. It felt almost like cheese stick with enough wine! Their scallops with figs and garlic bread tasted always great. Their duck dish was also divine. They kept developing new menus which was very exciting. One time we ordered churro and it cam out covered with cinnamon sugar and the manager asked how it was. We said it was too much or sugar and was too sweet. Next time we went, it came out plain without any sugar. I don't know if it was because they remembered us or they just changed the menu. It was better with a lot of sugar but cannot comment on it more. I'm sure they found a better replacement on their menu by now.   Price (4/5): We were in college without much money but this is tapas place where you can order many if small plates as you want. Their price is definitely great for the food and the portions were generous for a tapas place.   If we ever visit Madison again, we will probably come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Oh man.  If you have a special occasion evening that requires a fancy place to eat, THIS IS THE PLACE.  Every time I come home to Madison from California I stop in with my fiance. It's just so good.  We love everything about it here.  One of our favorite things is getting the combination of 4 bruschetta.  Every bite is an incredible combination of flavors with sweet and savory items to try.  It might not be on the square or where you would expect such a great place to be located but I guarantee it will be one of the best places you eat in the state of Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome service, and really nice ambiance! I haven't explored the wine list too much yet, so I can't really say anything about it other than it is extensive and the full list is on an iPad.  I've been here twice now, once for dinner and the second time for dessert and coffee. I was most impressed by the service both times. The servers have good suggestions for what to order and how much to order (really nice when a place serves small plates and you don't know what \"small\" really means).   The food is delicious, but be prepared to spend a lot. I noticed they have some pretty good happy hour specials on weekday evenings and all day Sunday, so I think next time I go for food I'll go during happy hour. The plates are significantly cheaper ($8-10 instead of $19-24).   Their desserts are awesome...I especially liked the strawberry rhubarb crisp.  Overall this is a nice place to come to for drinks and appetizers/dessert, or for a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"That this place has the same star average as L'etoile is utterly unbelievable. Literally, I do not believe it. I'm tempted to run through all 171/159 reviews and calculate the averages myself because there is no way that is an accurate reflection of the world. Eno Vino might be the best place on Junction Road in Middleton, but that's about as far as I'm willing to take it.  I just don't get the mad love for this place. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, it's true. They will give you a sample of any wine if you are unsure and that is very nice. The restaurant is dark which may qualify it as romantic for some, okay. And they have happy hour. All good.   But I hated the space. It felt fake. It felt like walking through an open house that has obviously been staged. No character, no soul, just a bunch of dark wood and overstuffed leather, just like everyplace else. Not my scene.   And though I only had 2 bruschettas, neither did their job of whetting my appetite and making me hungry for more. Served on pillowy bread with the texture of Wonder bread, I could not discern any flavor in either one. I'm not sure there was actually any brie on the brie fig bruschetta. None was visible under the mound of julienned apple shreds and certainly I could not taste any. The 1/16th of a teaspoon of fig jam easily got lost on the cottony bread. The caprese bruschetta was better, but only marginally so and only b/c of the balsamic drizzle which at least provided a little bit of flavor.  Perhaps that's my fault for ordering something with tomatoes in the dead of winter; but if you can't deliver it, don't offer it.  Will I be back? Probably. It's like a block away from my house and this really is the best place on Junction Road. But I'll only be back for a glass of wine after I've already eaten."}
{"text":"There is something about this location of Eno Vino that makes me feel so classy when I walk into it. The dim lighting and cozy tables make it the perfect place for an intimate dinner.   To begin with, the parking can be very chaotic and hard to find even though there is a parking lot. But don't let that discourage you.   Secondly, the wine selection they have is extensive, and they have a wonderful selection of cocktails and beers. If you have any questions, your server can help you with that!  In addition, the tapas here are to die for. Everytime I think of the bruschetta they have, the green beans, the flatbreads, and the ahi tuna tacos my mouth just waters. I adore everything they serve here and it's delicious.   Finally, the service here is great! I always feel well taken care of when I am here, and they always have answers for my questions."}
{"text":"I love Eno Vino! This is the perfect spot for getting together with your girlfriends or for date night!   The Fig Mule (not sure if that is on the menu or was a drink special) was AMAZING. Of course, the wine list is wonderful. I love going with someone else and picking plates to share. The brushettas are amazing. Chicken Skewers are very yummy!   My favorite thing about this place is their Wine & Tapas Wednesdays. Every Wednesday they have a 3-course tapas event, each course being paired with wines. Best part - it is a steal at only $35. I highly recommend!   Only negative: parking lot can be full at peak times.  EDIT: since I've posted the first review they opened up their downtown location. May be the best view in Madison. We ate here one afternoon when a storm was passing through. So cool!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly, honest servers. A bit too loud, but you won't notice it once you start indulging."}
{"text":"I was visiting Madison for work.  This place was recommended to me by some locals.  En Vino is kind of tucked away, but it's kind of better that way I feel like.  If it was downtown, you'd probably wait even longer for a table.    Excellent tapas-style selection, excellent choices of alcohol and cocktails.    Alex served us and she was great, attended to all of our stupid requests.   Kind of dark - can't really see the food I'm enjoying.  If that's the goal, they hit it on the nose."}
{"text":"We like to come here on special occasions since it is a bit pricey. The food and drink selections are all so good. We are even having our rehearsal dinner here."}
{"text":"A truly wonderful dinner.  Three wine tastings before we ordered a bottle, which Elise the sommilier selected, was spot on with the seared tuna platter and a beautifully dish of prepared beets with fennel and pomegranate.  Our server Joanna is the gracefull server that everyone enjoys; attentive, smiling, helpful and not pushy.  Plan to take your time enjoying the nuances of Eno Vino and you will go home with a smile and great memories."}
{"text":"The food was so good! I would recommend getting the potstickers. I believe I ordered about 5 plates. I just couldn't resist myself. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Best Tapas in Madison!   My wife and I will try to make it here a couple times a year for date nights. They have a wonderful wine selection, large menu of appetizers and always a few specials. Service is amazing, some of the best in Madison."}
{"text":"After eating roughly half the menu and drinking one of the tastiest dark and stormy's I have ever had (the \"daq and stormy\"), I am pretty well convinced that this is one of the best places to eat in the Madison area.  We had: goat cheese pastries, bruschetta, truffled fries, portabella mushroom ravioli, stuffed piquillo peppers, sea bass and scallops, chicken skewers, braised pork belly, center cut fillet, and a Thai chicken flat bread.   Every single thing we had was delicious, but there were definitely a few standouts. For me, the braised pork belly, the ravioli, and the Thai chicken flat bread were the best of the night. I would seriously eat a pound of that pork belly.   The service was great, the atmosphere was relaxing, and the water food was great. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the food or wine list. The idea of the ipad for wine list is crazy!   You can't look for it he right wine and the options are very limited. It should not be called a wine bar since there is nothing special about the wine they carry.   We ordered the seared tuna, green beans, flatbread and the battered shrimp. The tuna and green beans were pretty decent but the rest of the food was just below average. I do like the comparison from other teloera saying that it is very comparable to an overpriced Applebee's with wine.   I also noticed that the menu has not changed in over three years. The desserts are also terrible!"}
{"text":"The Applebee's of tapas bars.  The Chili's of wine bars.  The food is almost on par with Alchemy or Mickey's Tavern, but the pricing is 2x-2.5x.  Atmosphere: televisions, noise on par with Weary Traveler, and fat, old men pawing 20-something women.  Service: seated immediately, waited 25 minutes to get water and put in first drink order; waitress kept on trying to steer the meal in very odd directions (\"order an extra one to take home\").   Off the specials menu we ordered a lovely chorizo white bean soup that was the high point of the meal; it would have been even better if the tomato base had the taste you'd expect at the peak of tomato season and the black pepper had been reduced to allow other flavors to shine a bit more. Next we had pleasant stuffed peppers, which had very nice presentation and not much to remember in terms of mouth feel or taste.  The Thai flatbread pizza was the blandest item of the evening; coleslaw should not be more engaging than the accompanying jalapenos.  Our Spanish red was quite nice.  A place billing itself as a wine bar should have more than one Spanish red, especially when its manager was hired from the former La Paella.  The wine menu is not available on paper or on your cell phone. They provide one iPad per table for marking wine selection.  This works great for the restaurant, but is cumbersome for patrons (the larger your group, the more unmanageable it becomes).  If you want wine, go to Barriques.  If you want tapas, Madison's pickings are slim.  If you want better food at half the price, Madison's offerings abound."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Eno Vino off and on (been in and out of the state for years) for about 5 years!  I've always loved this place!  First off: they have one of the most amazing selections of wine AND liquor I've seen from any place I've been to in Wisconsin, Hawaii and all over Europe.  They have not only a good variety, but all good-quality liquor.  They don't waste their time with the crap.  Second, they have well-made drinks (mostly martinis) and the service and ambiance is very nice.  I often get the Espresso Martini, and I've never found a restaurant that does an Espresso Martini that well!  They have excellent Portobello Ravioli as well as Spicy Calamari.  These are foods you can find elsewhere, but they do the same or much better here (the Ravioli is unique and absolutely wonderful!)  As of a year or so ago, they've expanded the restaurant to give it about 20-30% more floor area.  That's very nice, especially for nights when it's packed (Wednesdays and Thursdays tend to be busy).

{"text":"Tapas......oh tapas.....  The good the bad and the ugly:  Everything we ordered (minus the chicken satay) were all impeccable.....but the wait in between got my mouth watering so much for the next dish that it was hard to contain myself.   it was also too bad that our dinner-mates that opted to go sans-tapas and more the traditional entree course were left waiting with empty plates while we were delivered several dishes.    The delicateness of the oxtail strudel, the delicious bruchetta, fried spicy calamari, were amazing. The tuna tartare was not impressive and the chocolate fondue was just plain chocolate syrup. $16 for lukewarm chocolate syrup was ridiculous.   Although we extremely disliked a few things.....at least we know now what to avoid and we will definitely be back because the dishes we DID like......were AMAZING!  And well worth another trip!"}
{"text":"Yay for a Madison Tapas Place!!!!!!!!!  This is THE BEST restaurant for excellent wine, really good portion tapas, and just all around ambiance.  I WILL say that I give it two thumbs down in their food selection, given that it's VERY vegetarian unfriendly.  But seriously their extensive wine list pretty much makes up for this!!!!  Wait staff is very courteous and well.. if you're in a good group, this is great to sample a ton of things.  However, this brings on the classic case scenario of the people who \"just want to pay for what they bought (regardless of the fact that they ate from another plate\" or the ones that \"forget\" that tipping is important.... But that's a story for another day..."}
{"text":"The five star is for the braised brisket and everything on the side. Frankly I don't care if the brussel sprouts were fried; they were done so deliciously and I could taste hint of cheese in the sweet potatoes mash but I love it. I want more sprouts please.  The bruschetta aren't as tasty as I remember maybe because the bread was toasted more this time. I could be that I'm exhausted with training and work after.  Would I come back? Absolutely.  Kirsten seems shy but maybe she could see that I'm dining alone and perhaps wanted to be left alone. She checked on me and I don't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Madison area. My husband and I even had our wedding dinner here. Our favorite dishes are the charred hot house tomato soup, truffled fries, seared sesame tuna, lamb empanadas, and Korean short rib potstickers. The wine and cocktail selections are always fun and change pretty regularly. My one complaint, however, is that their dessert menu used to change seasonally (which we really liked), but they stopped doing that over the last year or two. We recently moved to Seattle, and I'm still trying to find our Eno Vino replacement!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Wednesday night with a friend and we ordered probably 6 different dishes on their happy hour menu. I would say that the service was super slow and then when the dishes came through there were problems with a majority of them. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos which were super salty, the calamari fries were more batter than calamari, and the shrimp ceviche was way too sour which we informed the waitress but instead of offering to bring us a new plate or remove it from our tab she just took the plate back. I would never ever come back to this place again and I would not recommend anyone else to try this."}
{"text":"A true five star experience in every way. I can't complain about a thing - the atmosphere is modern, appropriately soft lighted, and that perfect balance of quiet, but not too quiet. The service is fantastic. The waitstaff are knowledgeable, prompt, and attentive. Then there's the food.   Oh god, there's the food.   The food is a cool selection of modern takes on American cuisine. Most of the plates are smaller and easy to share, and everything we've tried was excellent. I have to give a specific shout-out to the Hot House Tomato Soup, though. It is maybe the best soup I've ever had. The taste of real truffle oil and Wisconsin cheddar surround your mouth with savory, tangy, salty, cheesy, perfection. You also get an entire grilled cheese sandwich in your soup, so definitely grab a friend to share if you want to taste the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"-Great ambiance - romantic, beautiful, dark colors, gentle lighting. Too bad it is destroyed by giant sports TV screens! -Terrible service - had to flag down a waiter after being ignored for a long time. Seriously? -Wine bar? - NO, they don't get it. The server didn't have much to say about the wines I guess because she left an iPad on the table with info about the wines on it! NO - I am in a wine bar for god's sake, service and knowledge are expected, not a computer where I have to search and such! LAZY SERVICE.  -Ordered a wine flight and had to ask for bread to clear the palate - the worst isthat I asked specifically for \"plain bread\" and was given some crazy bread full of I don't know what nuts and fruits and a spread full of other flavors! Does this place not \"get\" wine tasting at all?? So I then asked the bus boy to bring me plain unflavored bread! (finally received some) Ridunkulous. -Lastly - two huge TV screens  were showing SPORTS - in a WINE bar!! Seriously? That ruined the otherrwise great decor. HINT TO MANAGEMENT: 1. Servers at a wine bar should have some knowledge about wine. 2. Sports bars and wine bars are not expected to be the same in any way."}
{"text":"I didn't take pictures of my yummy food because it was dark at the bar, but the food and the service are excellent at Eno Vino.  I was directed there by friends who had previously been.  It's slightly hidden in the corner of a mini-mall, but the space is deceptively big for such a small entrance.  I had a green salad with balsamic dressing, ahi tuna tacos and a bruschetta duo of salmon & roast beef.  The ahi tuna tacos are served on a crunchy shell with a dab of a creamy wasabi and a sweet chili sauce.  Those were awesome.  The good is great, but I was kind of limited because everything is small dishes and I easily hit my corporate dining max.  It's probably way more fun to bring a friend & share.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Truffle. Fries. That is basically all I need to say here. I moved here from Boston, so I will say that this definitely more of a \"Midwestern\" tapas place. Not in the sense that the food is midwestern, but the portions are a bit big. This is NOT a negative against the restaurant - (um, more truffle fries please!) just keep this in mind when you're ordering here. The cocktails are FANTASTIC and cheap! Thankfully, this please is around the corner from where we live, so we frequently go here when we're in the mood for something a little on the fancier side.   Whatever you do, order the truffle fries. I consider myself a french fry connoisseur and these are some of the best I've had. I'm giving it 4 and not 5 because EVERY. SINGLE. DESSERT. has cinnamon, and I'm allergic. I love dessert, and frankly this just isn't necessary. Overall. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Outrageously overpriced. I can only imagine that some of my fellow reviewers were tanked on wine when they wrote their glowing reviews, because the food is downright lousy.   My girlfriend and I had the soup of the day (chicken rice and curry, which was fine), and a decent salad. But then the tapas started. First, green beans, which were in a delicious sauce but were severely undercooked. Then, the flatbread, which is an awful way to waste $17. It was a chewy, flavorless affair that left us salivating for a $2 frozen pizza back at home. Then the Hangar Steak, which was also undercooked, lukewarm, and utterly bland.  It came paired with an unappetizing and -- brace yourself -- undercooked risotto!   Everything needed pepper, yet none was forthcoming.  It seemed the wait staff was too busy obliging other tables' requests to uncork another bottle of wine.   With drinks and tip, we taught ourselves a $95 lesson: don't eat here again."}
{"text":"We went here last week with another couple. Most of the food was tasty but some weren't that great for me. It was loud and hard to hear the server, and the service was very slow."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 10 and spent two hours enjoying food and drink! Everything we ordered was amazing and we tried A LOT of things. To name a few - the potstickers, the duck confit spring rolls, the thai flatbread, the veggie flatbread, the calamari, the truffle fries, the cheese plate, the green beans, the bruschetta, the pork tenderloin, the crab cakes, the tomato bisque, and several desserts. Everything comes out beautifully prepared and there was nothing that disappointed. It was a feast! We also tasted many different wines and cocktails and no one had any complaints there either. I am not a wine connoisseur, but the Pinot Grigio that I had was just fine. The place was packed, but we had a reservation and our table was ready when we arrived. Parking is a bit of a problem, but there is valet parking and parking across the street. Surprisingly, the desserts were our least favorite items. We tasted the warm chocolate cake, the bread pudding, fruit tart and peach cobbler. They were all \"OK\" but just didn't measure up to the savory dishes. Our servers were attentive and friendly and kept the food coming and cleared the dishes in a timely manner. I will definitely return to try the few items we didn't try!  Be prepared to part with some cash, but at least you are getting a good return on your money!"}
{"text":"It just isn't very good. The menu felt like we were eating someplace 15 years ago. Essentially a mix of bread, cheese and meat, with limited veg. That's in theory fine, but nothing felt particularly fresh... and with such an odd mix of flavor profiles, it doesn't work. Had some fine wine, but nothing special. The person in our group who suggested giving it a shot ended up apologizing at the end of the night."}
{"text":"This place had earned a reputation for being a \"cougar bar\", but we just re-visited recently and fell in love with it again.  My tip: go on a week night for fabulous happy hour specials!  Sure it gets busy in there and you may have to wait to find a table, but people watching is part of the fun isn't it?  We didn't have much issue and our table ordered a bunch of apps to sample and share...we loved the spicy green beans and the shrimp and andouille pizza was spectacular!  Will be back again soon...maybe sitting outside next time!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.    Decor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.  Get in here!!"}
{"text":"Love it, Love it, Love it.  Haven't taken anyone there who didn't say the same.  Food is great, infused martini's fabulous and the wine list extensive.  Go!"}
{"text":"I usually don't go to restaurants outside of the Madison downtown area, but I came here for a work event and will definitely be going back! The food and ambience are great. The food is meant to share so don't go if you're they type of person who doesn't like sharing. I took away 1 star for two reasons: 1. It's a bit loud in there so it's sort of hard to have a conversation when you're sitting across the table from someone and 2. Usually at a tapas style restaurant, they will change your plates in the middle so sauce and stuff doesn't have to get on the next food you eat. They didn't do that (and the plates were pretty tiny). Other than that, I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Took hubby here for his birthday.  It was FABULOUS! We had: Seared Sesame Tuna Sweet Chili Calamari Fries Labelle Farm Foie Gras Center Cut Filet OMG. Sooo freaking good!!  We will definitely be back!"}
