{"text":"Food is alright for a quick bite to eat. Drinks are ok, ceasers are pretty tasty.  I had the nicest waitress, she had an unusual name, but was very knowledgeable of the food/drinks. Would go back again when in the city."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with my friend after a trip to the ROM. Our server was very sweet and our food did not take too long either so everything on that end of things was good. However, the burgers come with the usual tomatoes, lettuce and onions and since I'm not a fan of onions and lettuce whenever I get burgers I always ask to have them traded for something else like jalapeños or olives. I've never had a problem with this before at any other restaurant most places are more than happy to make the switch since its only fair because the price of the burger does include 3 toppings, after all. When I asked our server here if she could give me jalapeños instead, she said they don't usually do that but she could ask the kitchen. She came back and said they could only remove the lettuce and onions and serve it to me with just the patty and tomatoes but cannot not trade the other 2 toppings with something else. Pretty weird considering the burger's price includes 3 toppings and a patty so I don't see the problem with trading them for others. They wouldn't even let me trade them for a spicy sauce! Which was a massive disappointment since the burger itself doesn't come with any kind of sauce on it. Bottom line, I've had much better veggie burgers but I just may not have enjoyed it as much as others because of the lack of sauces and toppings of my choice. I want to reiterate that our server was very sweet and apologetic throughout our visit she was very nice but I think the kitchen needs to take customers' preferences into account and be a little more flexible. I did end up getting the jalapeños as an additional topping which I had to pay for because I wasn't going to eat a burger with just a a patty and tomatoes on it, but it still was nowhere near the best burger I've had. Usually I trade lettuce and onions for jalapeños and olives and get a spicy sauce on the side like hot sauce or chipotle sauce and add cheese, the latter 2 which i don't mind paying extra for because of course they start to become additional toppings on top of the number of toppings that the burger usually comes with. If I wanted a what you see is what you get burger I would've just gone to McDonald's and avoided paying $10+ for that burger. Not worth it, in my opinion, much better burgers can be found in other places for that price. Wouldn't recommend or come back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. I just went this weekend during a visit to Toronto for the holidays and they have a serious roach infestation. We told our waitress and they deducted half of our check and gave us 3 free meal passes. The manager did not come to see us but acted so quickly - seems to me like they know they have a problem and are not taking care of it. Incredibly unsanitary conditions - if I saw 5-6 roaches in the dining room alone I cannot imagine how many are in the kitchen near food preparation. Absolutely disgusted. This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the services of the waiters ruin everything. They are rude and demand tips instead of working for it. Especially the waiter named Letticia!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time because Over Easy nearby was full. We had our skepticism because the place was less than half filled. But what the heck, gave it a try. We ordered some all day breakfast and sandwiches. Couple brunch menu items were under $10, which was surprising. The food came, it was well made and well plated, and the dishes were preheated. I'd give 8/10 for food. Not a big fan with tons of raw onion in salad, but not a big deal.  Reading other comments, perhaps it is a different experience for dinner/bar? May be we are lucky, but we were served by a very attentive server as well. Really don't have anything negative to say......will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Close to st George, museum and bay stations which is nice. Check out the daily deals. Monday half price wings ontop of their 25th anniversary $3 coronas was a delight for midtown/yorkville area :). It gets 3 stars because I imagine it a pretty regular joint outside of the specials, as seen in their food and service enthusiasm"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out thanks to the excellent staff. I have to say the bartender/waitress Laura is the main reason me and a lot of my friends go there."}
{"text":"Went to Gabby's to grab a quick lunch before heading to the Rom. Had my baby girl with me at the time with her stroller. There was a soccer match on that day, so the resto was a bit busier than usually I guess, but I never expected to receive such poor service at the door. We saw seating in the front of the restaurant, with lots of space, was told I would not be able to bring my stroller in, add it is a fire hazard. So I proceeded to remove the car seat attached to the stroller, as my daughter was asleep, and also to small to sit alone. The waitress then proceeded to tell us the kitchen was backed up and put meals would take between 30-40 minutes and asked if we wanted to stay, at that point, it seemed like she was trying to get us to leave. I was already a but peeved about the stroller situation, but this was starting to anger me a bit more. We proceeded to the table at which point the waitress told us we were not allowed to add an extra seat at the end of the table for my car seat as it is again a fire hazard and her manager would not allow out. At this point we decided to leave. This was ridiculous. I have never been mistreated so horribly at a restaurant for having brought my baby with me. Hindsight, it was a bar, however I just looked at it like a Kelsey restaurant, as they served food as well. Didn't know families weren't allowed to eat at a Gabby's. Really upsetting as I felt discriminated against for having a child. The waitress was rude and ultimately lost our business because of out. We ended up at Mark McEwans restaurant, the One, which I highly recommend, as they were very accommodating and did not make me feel horrible for having a baby. Definitely do not go to this Gabby's, utterly horrible service."}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful patio, good company. Went for dinner and almost everyone had their famous burgers. The waitress was especially friendly and diligent."}
{"text":"Went to Gabby's for a quick lunch after the ROM. It was awful. The server was very pleasant, but it took 55 minutes for the food to make it to the table - and when it did it was awful. It cost $34 for two terrible sandwiches (Mediterranean wrap that was bitter with far too much goat cheese - something I didn't even think possible before this experience - and a mediocre club sandwich) and boring fries that had a strange after-taste that I couldn't place. I ate them only because I was really hungry and the sandwich was so awful. I would never go back. Don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with 3 of my friends. Our waitress was rude and annoyed that she had to even take our order. She would mumble to herself if we were OK (didn't ask us if we need anything, and left majority of the time). Another server asked how we were doing and one of my friend complained about our original waitress' attitude... apparently our waitress is the manager. First and last time I would ever eat here. PLUS, the manager does not know how to properly pour beer (the picture is self explanatory.. my friends and I watched her attempt 7 times for 5 minutes)"}
{"text":"Excellent service from the waitress who is also very pretty might I add, first impression of the place was welcoming and good fun! Went with a group of people and there was enough room for all 8 of us and not squashed at all. The drinks menu had lots of choice and they even had an offer on that day $5 martini which was great and very tasty! The food menu was ear and easy to understand and had lots of chose quite similar to TGI Fridays that we have in the uk :) was well worth the money :) also very impressed that the server could remember the whole order with out writing it down. Also they could do split bills for us which was great :)"}
{"text":"I went during one of those special celebratory events with my family and the experience was quite enjoyable! The server (can't remember his name :( )  was very polite and accommodating for the young children in the party. The food was good and it was great to see the kids finishing their entire meal.  I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Normally I love gabbys. I love the environment and their food (especially on mondays and wednesdays when they have half proce chicken wings). I have visited the one on king west and also the one at sherbourne street dozens of times. But this one, never again. Rude waitresses, bad management."}
{"text":"I like places like this. Just simple food and good drinks.  We were in here at a time between dinner and lunch so it was so quiet and the service was great. They were super friendly and fast. The food was good. Hit the spot after all the walking we'd been doing."}
{"text":"Went here after randomly being the ROM area, and had no expectations. Gabbys exceeded any I could have had. I am officially a fan. +Great, extensive menu. Good healthy options (whole wheat club sandwich!) +Lots of drinks +Good specials (Monday night wings!) + EXCELLENT service +Good price  Much better than other food options in the area (McDonalds) and good seating. Would like to try the outdoor patio in the summer.  Just stopped in cause I was in the neighbourhood, but I will be going here very deliberately again."}
{"text":"i got food poisoning from here a while back thanks to chicken nachos. (the chicken was cold and pink and the nachos look like they had been reheated in a microwave and sat out as they were cold and soggy wet)  never set foot in here again, perhaps over time it has changed its standards and become a place where you feel as though you may live after visiting."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout. The onion rings were good. But the fish and chips were a disappointment. They gave a tiny piece of fish and it was extremely soggy. The fries were unsalted."}
{"text":"Was here for a date this summer and I had a very pleasant experience. The staff are excellent at determining when to come over and ask if we needed anything. They gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted (which we needed - their menu is full of such tasty sounding things). The music was nice and at a tolerable volume. We ate there fairly late but considering the noise level of the other patrons I have a feeling that during the peek dinner hour it gets fairly loud in there.   One thing that raised my eyebrows was that their drinks had a lot of ice, my date only recieved about half a glass of drink and the rest was ice displacing the volume.  Their burgers, however, are to die for. Prime rib and tender, large size and served with a big helping of a side dish. I had goat cheese on my burger and now I don't think I'm going to be able to go back to eating burgers without it."}
{"text":"WORST SERVER I HAVE EVER HAD IN TORONTO.  Yesterday I went out with my mother and my sister just for some wings.  We entered this place at 9:30 pm. Almost empty no rush at all for the servers or us.  Just not to make it long let me put it this way.   The server, (hazelnut hair, short with a nose piercing) brought us our wings with the wrong sauce not one time, TWO times. Yes sir, TWO times.  To make matters worse she blamed it on us. I ordered wings with HOT sauce and she brings to the table BBQ sauce wings. I even said buffalo to make it CLEARER.   She replies these are buffalo. Really wow, since when BBQ is called buffalo, I must be a complete ignorant all my life.  The second time she brings honey garlic wings which I never ordered and she says: you pointed them.  By the way the wings were disgusting, poorly sauced and dry.  WOW, you have issues miss.  Anyways I put the wings away and get the bill and she charges me an iced tea which my sister ordered but that never came to the table and she says: sorry.  I AM VERY GLAD I SAID OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF YOUR MANAGER HOW UNPROFESSIONAL AND PATHETIC YOUR SERVICE WAS AND I HOPE YOU GET FIRED.  Sorry to put the caps on but I can not tolerate a bad service anymore in this city. I am restaurant owner myself and this to me is beyond disrespectful.  Cheers guys never go to this gabbys..."}
{"text":"As a tourist in Toronto I enjoyed an amazing week of sightseeing and experiencing great meals and kind souls. That all ended when I walked into Gabby's... I was met with such harsh rudeness and such an abrasive attitude that I felt I just got splashed in the face with acid.  I can honestly say that i didn't bother to try the food or drink, and I walked right out. Not sure what your business model is, but I'm not buying.   Pro tip - if you like being treated like a human being, don't come here."}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I spent a couple nights in this bar last year. It was close to the hotel and the event we were attending at the ROM, and relatively low key which is perfect for us.  The bartenders were friendly and helped us navigate the unfamiliar Toronto beer landscape and even made a passable old fashioned (something that seems to be rare) when I asked for one of those instead.  We also split and enjoyed some apps. Their hot wings were actually surprisingly hot and the fries were tasty. In a real surprise, they had amazing Bleu cheese, something I always try to note in my reviews of wing places.  Overall I would say this was a great spot for a few drinks and a quick bite and would absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"2.5 stars... I remember Gabbys when it was less of a chain...and now despite being everywhere I look it hasn't really retained any of its charm - only the name. Too bad, it was quaint once upon a time now it's bright, fancy and utterly devoid of character."}
{"text":"We had a reservation but we had to change the time twice due to traffic delays.  When we got there, they had saved us a beautiful half circle diner booth which was very cozy and warm on this cold winter's night.  Our waitress was so calm and listened patiently to each of our orders. I noticed the managers were very involved in helping staff bring out orders and in the general flow of things.  The only thing they could improve on is greeting people at the door.  When I arrived, I the host walked away and didn't come back for a few minutes.  One of the waitresses in that area ignored me for a bit too and finally when she returned, she came up to me and asked if I had been helped.  Also, our waitress served a couple other tables before us and we had to wait again for a while before we were asked if we wanted to start with a drink.  Once our waitress took our order, things got better."}
{"text":"My niece and nephew were happy enough with their meals -- pizza and other kiddie staples -- but only one of them was big on the poutine, the french fries and gravy sauce that appears to be Canada's national dish. It's been only a week, and I can't even recall what I had, so it must not have been very memorable. And I'm one who won't easily forget a good dish. However, the waiter was very nice, even if he did forget to refill my drink even after I'd asked, and there wasn't anything *terrible* about the place. Not worth going out of your way for, but it makes a good spot for when you're visiting the ROM, as we were."}
{"text":"Gabby's is what you'd expect from any local pub.   Drinks - Check. Food - Check. Patio (a very teeny one however) - Check.  I've been here a handful of times and the service has always been good, the food has always been decent and the crowd has always been relatively tame.  There are definitely more entertaining pubs in town, but if you're in the area and need a quick bite/drink, Gabby's will meet your  pub requirements."}
{"text":"Worse bar ever. Declined both of my credit cards the when I came here yesterday. Freaked out I called my bank and no problem. They were close today so I came in for a quick beer and asked for a easy order....wings with hot and medium on the side. After 30 minutes I asked the bartender where are the wings and she ran back to the kitchen and grabbed some wings. They came cold, one sauce on the side and I sent them back. She did take them off the bill. Avoid with so many other options around yorkville."}
{"text":"Its a chain pub on a section of Bloor without a lot of options for booze that aren't super high end. My girlfriend and I came here on my birthday weekend to celebrate me getting OLD.   We had the $4 Caesar specials and I also had the Jameson and Sprite cocktail. Everything was good and service was friendly."}
{"text":"The food is ok! The atmosphere is very old school. The prices are reasonable.  Just ok. Nothing else to say really..."}
{"text":"Came here for a large group social event. There were approximately 20 of us, but only one server. It would have been ideal if we could have had another server as it took us more than 10 minutes after being seated to get a clean glass. Food was average. Service less than average."}
{"text":"We were there Tuesday this week with some friends. It was mid afternoon. It was quite busy due to the crowds at the Museum across the street. We were served coffee and then ordered some lunch. We noticed after a while that our food wasn't coming. We asked the waitress where our food was and when she checked, she realized that she forgot to order it. She was quite embarrassed and then said our meal  would be free. The manager came over and apologized. We said that we were not upset at all and made sure the waitress was not paying for this herself. Anyways, the food came, it was good. Reasonably priced. The place was clean, the washrooms were clean. So Gabby's is good. More of a sports bar type atmosphere. They handle problems well. We would go again!"}
{"text":"went in  last night to have a beer and some wings sat at bar there was 1 girl working in whole place she wasn't even busy just talking to other customers at the bar I had to wait about 5 mins  to get a drink  I said wow your short staffed tonight she said what makes u think that? I told her been sitting here over 5 mins she said I just arrived 30 sec ago rule number 1 you never accuse customer lying seeing other reviews of food taking 50 mins or more no wonder I waiting over 5 mins for a hello lol I ordered my beer and asked for a menu she said kitchen closed how can u be a restaurant and not at least serve snacks or appetisors? I said forget beer I came to eat she walks away with saying goodnite"}
{"text":"It's now January 2011 and Gabby's is still standing."}
{"text":"I frequent and enjoy Gabby's in the entertainment district during TIFF, and I assumed the Bloor location would be comparable. Not so.  I ordered a soft drink with no ice. I was served ice. My hamburger was very dry and the fries were cold.  My friend ordered coffee and the cup had lipstick stains on it.  The service was slow; my money was wasted."}
{"text":"we were visiting the area and found the staff very friendly Food was good; prices seemed reasonable to us (we're used to NY prices so we can not always be relied on :)  Ate here twice on our trip"}
{"text":"Good pub food service was on can improve on that Pretty reasonable pricing and it has a big bar table and plenty of TV screens with some sports on!"}
{"text":"It's an okay bar... just too convenient for UofT students.  I spent too many nights here, none of which involved alcohol.    This location is right by Bloor & Avenue, so it's really close to UofT residences and Yorkville.  As such, prepare to get carded - even if you're in your mid-20s.  Dang, I got carded buying a diet Coke, and since US licenses aren't up to snuff with Gabby's, I had to carry my passport (with valued student visa) any time I wanted to chow here after 9 or 10pm.    The food here is okay - standard pub grub plus some pizzas at higher-than-pub prices.  The service is hit or miss... usually unbothersome and gets stuff done, but at points we had really, really awful service - even when it wasn't packed.  The back patio is really good for groups.  You'll have to get service at the bar if you want refills, but past that it's a nice outdoor space if you're having a large meetup."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 3 stars at least.  Got the bogo wings, which were obviously yesterdays leftovers. The wings were small and dry. Obviously yesterdays stock re-fried to be heated up.   The location is great across from the ROM  Service was average at best  I won't go back given the other options around the corners in this area  Can't say we'd recommend either ...to bad"}
{"text":"The location is great. The fries are okay. The veggie burger is pretty good. The washrooms need to be cleaned more often. Overall a great environment to hang out."}
{"text":"Looked okay, until I looked harder and noted a cockroach. Read the reviews and hightailed it. Hopefully I out-ran the roach!"}
{"text":"I've been here once for lunch and once for late night snacks. Both times, the service was not particularly fast but some prompting got the attention of the staff. Their mixed appetizer plates are quite large in serving size and make for a great sharing dish, especially if it's not a full meal and just an extended snack. The lunch portions are quite reasonable and are usually just enough for one person. It does get pretty crowded at lunch, so make sure to call ahead of time to get a table. By contrast, it's not that difficult to get a table in the evening, even when most other places around there are closed and it's one of the few places still serving food.  There's nothing particularly remarkable about Gabby's, but it gives off a pub/bar atmosphere, just as one would expect. It's comfortable, there are no surprises, and it seems like the sort of place that you could rely on over time."}
{"text":"A group of local friends brought a few of us here for after-dinner drinks and snacks. Our first challenge was getting seated. There were two tables in the front which could accommodate us if we put them together, but we were told they wanted to save those tables for smaller parties. We said we were there just for drinks, so they let us sit there, but without moving the tables together, i.e., we were seated as 2 separate parties. One of the women at my table, who has come here several times, made some \"unexciting\" comments about the place, to which my reply was \"So it sounds like entry level pub and grub,\" to which she agreed.   It felt that way to me. There was nothing wrong with anything, but there was nothing really enticing either. The beer and drink menus were skimpy, though what they served they did make and deliver nicely... once our server actually finished double and triple-checking everything we ordered (she had to come back twice). The other thing I immediately noticed is that cocktails here, while reasonably priced, were also unreasonably small. I'd say beer is probably your best option here.  Likewise for food, nothing was bad, but nothing was really interesting either.  My favorite things here were the overall atmosphere of the place and the taste of the cocktails."}
{"text":"When the wings are half price it's worth it otherwise meh...the service while friendly is slow, and it takes a bit to get your first drink ordered or anything (as the menu's are on the table it's not like they bring one so if you know what beverage you want your waiting) however the wings are good, decent size pint however most of their beer specials aren't my thing as coors etc isn't my kind of  beer (My problem not theirs or maybe yours who knows) lots of tvs for the games, music etc. All depends on what you want from a spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a few drinks as we had some time to kill. The bartender was great and drinks were reasonably priced. We ordered an app and it came out immediately. Had a great experience here."}
{"text":"I went to Gabby's with 4 friends on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. It was around 3pm, not quiet but not terribly busy. It took them 10 minutes to acknowledge us at the door. When we finally could sit down, our server didn't come for probably another 10 minutes. She eventually did but she was AWFUL. She had a terrible attitude, and the few times she did ask us questions (\"how's it going?\" chit chat things like that) she would turn around and walk away without waiting for our responses or acknowledging us beyond her first question. We waited for nearly 45 minutes for our food, and when it came it was sloppily put together and cold. She rarely came to check on us, and when we asked for refills it took her forever to come back to our table. She acted like we were putting her out of her way whenever we asked for anything. Not a warm or attentive person, and the food was meh. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great service and good food for a fair price. I went with my wife after a really nice and tiring morning at the Royal Ontario Museum and was greeted by a really helpful and nice waitress. We ordered one plate of nachos and one poutine. The poutine was ok but the nachos are amazing!  We are definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and friendly staff. The food was good, the drinks were reasonably priced. We ordered fried calamari, chicken quesadilla, fries, bruschetta to have with our drinks all were good. Good place to go watch a game and talk with friends. We were a group of 9 and there was no problem accommodating us."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to go to several of the Gabby's that dot the city, and yes, I've been to this one, but it's by far my least favourite of the bunch.  Let me say right now that it has done absolutely nothing wrong.  It holds up to the standards of the Gabby's franchise with aplomb, the staff are as good as any other Gabby's location, the food is the same fare that you would get at any of the other franchises.  But it's the environment that just doesn't suit as well as the others.  It appears to have used the space it was given to the best of its abilities, but as a result it doesn't have the intimate and homey feel of its sister pubs.  High ceilings, more modern décor, and a slightly more urban and cultured vibe (if possible for a Gabby's) leave this place echo-y and cavernous.  There's no sense of warmth or friendliness.  At least not as much as say the one in the Beach (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gabbys-restaurant-group-toronto-3) or on King St. E (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gabbys-on-king-toronto)."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a few times about a year ago and I promised myself I wouldnt come back.  I reluctantly had lunch here last week with some friends from out of town as we were around the neighbourhood craving for some quick pub food and drinks. I had the california chicken and a bottle of stella. The california chicken was actually delicious. The meat was tender and juicy, and their garlic mayo sauce really wrapped things up. My friends enjoyed their meals as well (they had fish and chips, wings, crispy chicken burger), and service was quick. I will definitely be back again for lunch if I'm ever around Bloor."}
{"text":"I recently went to Gabby's after not eating here for several years.  The reason that I stopped going to this restaurant was that the wait times were always ridiculously long.  I decided to give them another try.  The renovation is quite nice, and the wait staff are very pleasant.  Unfortunately, the wait times are still unacceptable, both for someone to take our order, and to wait for our food.  This restaurant isn't suitable for people on their lunch break who have limited time.  The food was typical pub fare, although very tasty.  Of course, we were so hungry at that point, we would have been happy with pretty much anything."}
{"text":"My family ended up at Gabbys before a trip to the ROM.   I've got to say, that without question this was the worst meal we have bought for years.   For starters, before we ordered our food, my wife took our 3 kids to the washroom and they were disgusting. It looked like they hadn't been cleaned for days.  She had to pop her head into the kitchen afterwards to just make sure it was a little more hygienic. Thankfully it was.   Sadly all the burgers were off the menu because their burger supplier apparently recalled all the burgers. That left the menu a little more limited, but still plenty to choose from.   We ordered our food, and it took about 45 minutes to get to us. A very poor showing. Yes, they were busy, but isn't that why they are in business?  My kids ordered wings, and got these little boneless chicken balls!  Maybe this was clear on the menu, but when you order wings, you hope to get wings, instead of chicken balls.   I had the club sandwich. It was pretty tasteless and generally very dry. So much so, that in the end I started to dip it into some ketchup just so it had some kind of taste!  Fries were OK, but no better than that.   My wife had the sliders, and 2 sisters in law had a salad and bison burger between them.  They all fed back that their meals were cold.  Not even luke warm.   I can only assume that the meals were all cooked and ready in the kitchen for 10-15 mins before they finally brought them out to us. Really shocking.   Anyway, safe to assume that I'll never step foot into there again. Food terrible, but washroom cleanliness even worse, which is a very big no no.   Sadly, there's not a lot of alternative choices in the area.  But, frankly, I'd rather starve!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. The internet connection is never on or works. It's dirty. The card machine they give you to pay with never works. Their beer is overpriced..  i never seen anyone ordering their food."}
{"text":"This was the worst decision I have made in Toronto thusfar. Horrible service at the bar coupled with no organization and no logical flow of food.  Every table in the restaurant was waiting for 50 plus minutes for food. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS EQUATION. Hire a new manager and learn how to develop a proper business model because currently this establishment is failing... HORRIBLY.  Consensus from every patron suffering along with us consistent and infuriating. Close your doors until you can accommodate a crowd. People are leaving angry and all we can do is laugh because it's better than crying. Thanks for shitting on my Toronto experience."}
{"text":"I don't really know how to rate this place, so I'll just describe it.   Food is average, prices are average, staff are great, decor is good for sports bar, and the TVs are great.    I go here frequently to watch games, and was there last night to check out a Habs game.  Sat at the bar and ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with fries.  Pretty good (though the fries were mediocre).    All was well, until halfway through eating, a small cockroach scurried across the bar towards my plate.  Killed it (technically my buddy did as he grab a menu for squishing) and notified the bartender.  She apologized and said she'd let the manager know.  Still gross, but I guess most restaurants probably have to deal with pests from time to time...  So there it is.  Great for watching a game and having a pint, but not sure if I'll order food anymore after that experience.   I know a lot of people would give an automatic 1 star for a roach, but I'm going with a 2.5 based on all my previous good times there."}
{"text":"Me and my dining companion of the day winded up here by chance simply because it was a cold day and we did not want to travel far. I was drawn in by the colourful signage and I had never noticed this place back when I had classes right down the street. The seating area here is incredibly narrow and it was actually quite busy for a weekday afternoon. We were ushered into the back of the restaurant and plopped down to read over a very extensive menu. When my eyes glanced over the words \"poutine burger\" my eyes glazed over and I was absolutely set on ordering that and nothing else. My friend ordered the regular burger and when we received our plates, I was super disappointed to see that save for a few pieces of fries and cheese curds, both burgers were identical in toppings and appearance. Now that I look back on it, I'm pretty sure the poutine burger was created as a touristy gimmick to lure hungry travelers from the ROM into thinking they were getting the quintessential Canadian experience because poutine eh?  Service was pretty slow and the tables and cups were definitely dirty. Not good at all."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went here with a friend just this past Tuesday because she was staying at the Intercontinental. The ambience was great, the food was so good, the prices were definitely affordable and the music was good too! Not too loud, we were able to talk to each other and it had a good mix. I had the triple decker with sweet potato fries and chipotle dip I stole from my friends' combo platter. Both were delicious. The waitress was super friendly and the service was good. Didn't take long to get our food. I definitely want to come to this location again and would love to go to some of the others! There are many things I want to try from their menu. Oh, and awesome specials going on every day of the week!"}
{"text":"The food is awful and it's overpriced.  Extremely rude staff.  Never going back."}
{"text":"It was what it was. The food was what I expected, and the service was fast. It's a standard chain restaurant menu, with a small but somewhat diverse beer selection. The weekly specials would be good to keep in mind, and maybe I will go one night to take advantage of one."}
{"text":"Gabby is usually pretty good but I have to say their Nachos were really disappointing. First off I think they put cheese wiz and secondly I swear we had a taste of something that had gone off."}
{"text":"MLB Package. Good wings. Limited draft beer selection. Honest bartender. Really a 3.5 star sports bar. For Canada. Eh?"}
{"text":"I bet this place goes crazy when school and hockey are in session. On a weeknight in July? Three drugged-up deejays from Chicago were the only other drinkers in the whole big bar and restaurant. It was pretty late on a Monday night, but that's one paltry crowd for a cavernous place alight with television's bright glow. However, the bartender was really nice and introduced me to each member of the Rickard's family of passable beers (Red was the best). Anyhow, I wouldn't expect a party in the summertime, but I'd have some beers here again."}
{"text":"first time here for lunch, great service, i love the half price wings on Monday and Wednesday.  will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"To give a short version, Food is decent, Interior is decent, Hygiene is questionable (where it doesn't show), Service is TERRIBLE.  Food was okay. We ordered the standard burger, and the 3 Sliders. Taste-wise, they weren't amazing, but were of decent bar food quality. The burger patty, while a little dry and tough, tasted okay. The bun was a little chewy too, but not enough to complain about. Out of all the burgers and sliders, the pulled pork slider was the best out of all.   The interior was nice - everything that are exposed are clean and tidy. The bathrooms, and the stairs/halls leading up to it were smelly, slippery, and greasy, making the Hygiene part questionable.  Service was terrible on two dimensions. Firstly, the overall service was terribly slow. It took them nearly 15 minutes to even check-up and take our order, and another 30 to bring the food and beverages - it took us around 45 minutes to get our food from the point of sit-down. However, this was the less offensive part of our experience.   The server lady who helped our table (blonde lady with glasses and tattooed sleeves) seemed to be in a constant agitated state, which was not a pleasant experience for us. Aside from her less than pleasant attitude and slow service, however, what really shocked me was her comments to an Asian couple sitting next to our table. The man, judging from the commotion the server lady was making, must have waved his hand a little to get her attention. The server lady came up to their table, and with a loud voice which everyone in the restaurant could hear, yelled out \"HI!!! YES, I SEE YOU!!! HI, NICE TO SEE YOU TOO! Is that a cultural thing? Do you wave at your servers in your culture?\", all while waving her hand in their faces. The couple, who seemed to be very fluent in English, looked dumbfounded at the treatment they received, as were all others around their table. While I do realize that waving at servers is rude, that kind of racist, public humiliation was not called for.   All in all, not a pleasant experience, will go back only for the lack of a better choice."}
{"text":"Uh-oh, big slide in food quality and service this visit.  Been coming for years and always enjoyed the wings, but this tradition stopped today."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent service and most importantly delicious food. We went to a concert across the street at the Royal conservatory and had diner at Gabby's. It was a great experience. Our burgers were cooked to perfection with option for a gluten free bun. Prices very reasonable for the location compared to other restaurants around the area. Definitely will go back for our next concert!"}
{"text":"Ordered burger. Average. Had better down the street but it was filling.   Waiters were okay too.   Wouldn't rate this restaurant anything special. A good place if you want to bring your friends for a bite in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Near the ROM. Tried the veggie burger which was decent. Had better but was a lunch filler. The fries were really good. If they were crispier it would be perfecto. They served the food fairly quick, which is always a positive during lunch.   Nice atmosphere. Table we sat at was a bit dirty on top (sticky) but they were quick to clean that up."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Fries are great. Lots of options on menu. Great place to hang out and have lunch. Convenient location.   Update: food continues to be good and so does service. Bathrooms are very dirty, won't take a star away but be warned and go before you come here!"}
