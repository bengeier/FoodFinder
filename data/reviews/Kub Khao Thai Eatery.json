{"text":"3.5

The 5 of us decided to try our luck on a Sunday for lunch, 3 weeks ago. I had seen a lot of reviews saying there was a long wait since the restaurant was small, but we decided to give it a shot anyways. We got there around 1pm, and there was a full house. There was no one else waiting for a table, so we decided to wait, and were seated after 25 mins.

We ordered a Pad Thai Chicken ($7.95) from the quick lunch section, served from 11am - 4pm. The lunch deals comes with a spring roll and choice of soup or salad. We chose the salad, which was a mango salad. We also ordered a Khao Soi with Chicken ($12.95), a Roasted Duck Curry ($12.95) which came with a bowl of rice, and a Grilled Chicken with Sticky Rice ($10.95) which had to be changed to Fried Chicken because they had run out of Grilled Chicken. We wanted one more dish and asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the Holy Basil with Egg ($12.95) and we chose the Pork to go with it since we had a lot of poultry dishes already, 

The 5 of us agreed, that by far our fav item was the Roasted Duck Curry. It had a bit of sweet from the lychee, tangy from the tomato, creamy from the coconut milk, and had just a hint of spicy. It went really well with the roasted duck in the curry. This was a dish I would definitely order over and over again. The Pad Thai was pretty good, but didn't really amaze me. Portion size of it was pretty good for lunch portion. It was not overly wet or tomato-y, which is what I don't like in a Pad Thai, so that was good. I really liked the mango salad that came with the lunch. I loved the sweet and sourness of it, and I wished there was more. The spring roll was pretty good as well. The Fried Chicken with Sticky Rice came with 4 pieces of chicken. We ordered it off the regular menu because the waitress told us it was a bigger portion. I don't know how much you get if you order the same thing from the lunch menu. I probably would have preferred to order from the lunch menu and get an extra spring roll and salad instead. Not to say it wasn't good. The chicken was fried pretty well, it came with a sweet chili sauce that was a tad spicy for my liking. Without the sauce the chicken was slightly plain. The sticky rice it came with was ok, but you had to eat it fast cause once it got cold, it got hard. I also wasn't really sure how I was to incorporate the fried chicken with the sticky rice, so I just ate them separately.    

I was really interested in trying the Khao Soi as I've never had one before and my sis says its one of her fav Thai dishes. I thought the flavour was quite good. Although I didn't really eat it right away, and most of the crispy strips on top had already gotten mixed in since we were all sharing, so I didn't get the mix in texture I was hoping for. My sis says its not as good as the ones she's had downtown. We didn't ask to change any of the spice level of any of the dishes, so they came in their original intended spiciness level. Although for some weird reason my parents who can usually handle very spicy food found the Khao Soi way too spicy. While I, who usually can't handle spicy food, didn't find the Khao Soi too spicy. Finally, none of us liked the Holy Basil the waitress recommended. It was just diced up stir fried pork with some red peppers and onion. There was nothing really special about it and we found it too salty. We also didn't think a dish like that was worth $13.            

One thing I didn't like too much was that they didn't have a lot of the proteins we wanted when we were ordering, which was disappointing. We originally wanted the Khao Soi with Beef, but they had run out of beef. We also originally wanted the Grilled Pork Sticky Rice from the Lunch section, but they were also out. So we went with the Grilled Chicken Sticky Rice off the regular menu for a bigger portion, but it had to be changed to Fried Chicken because they were out of Grilled Chicken as well. However, we noticed other tables were able to order the Grilled Pork Sticky Rice we wanted later on, when we had already started eating. They probably don't prep enough of some of the proteins. We wanted more variety, but most of what we ordered ended up being chicken.   

The price and portion size for lunch was really worth it. The price and portion size for the regular menu is still ok, but some items might not be as worth it. Service was slightly slow as there was only one waitress. Seating were relatively comfortable. There wasn't a lot of room to stand when waiting for a table, where we didn't feel like we were invading the other diners' space. Overall, there were some items I liked and some I didn't, but I think I would still come back to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant had two seating sections, the front is pretty simple and the back is decorated with a Thailand theme. We had the crispy chicken wings with sticky rice. This we would order again, it had a nice dipping sauce. We also ordered the pad thai with chicken. I've had better pad thai and will not order again. The service was good and overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"Despite the diversity of Asian cuisines available in the GTA, \"authentic\" Thai food is quite difficult to find, so I was very pleased when I heard about this restaurant! I know lineups were crazy when they first opened so we waited for the hype to die down before trying it out. 

We came here for lunch and ordered: 
- Thai Iced Coffee: Very milky and sweet. I prefer my coffee to be stronger but this is good for those who don't like a bold coffee flavour
- Curry Puffs: Loved the flakiness of the pastry! The curry filling was on the sweeter side
- Masaman Curry with chicken: This curry is very mild so it's good for those who can't handle overly spicy foods. 
- Khao Soi with beef: Yum! Our favourite dish. Love the pile of deep fried egg noodle and the soup was so creamy. Another mild dish! 

It seems like, by coincidence, the food we ordered were all on the milder side. Will definitely have to come back and try the spicier dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Thai food in a charming restaurant tucked away in a Scarborough strip mall. The ChooCheePla, a fish dish with curry and coconut milk was delicious and the mango salad, fresh and subtle, was one of the best we'd had. Solid Pad Thai, good soup and cashew chicken rounded out an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Came here to try one of their quick lunch combos.  For less than $10 you get a soup or salad with spring roll and the main dish! Only problem is this place is a bit slow as there is only one server. If you can overlook that, and probably because it is new, then this is a great place to go for some authentic Thai food. For my main dish I had a pad Thai and i really like how they separate the sprouts and peanuts away from the pad Thai. The pad Thai tasted great and did not disappoint. However the main surprise is the salad, which taster better than I anticipated. I would recommend people to opt for the salad if they are ordering the quick lunch combos. All in all I would come back here again, most likely when not during the peak hours to avoid slower service."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Scarborough! I had the mango salad and a green curry and it was delicious!!! Cute ambiance and the food is super authentic."}
{"text":"Food, most of the Yelper has already told you it's really good and authentic Thai Food.  

Need to praise a bit about the green curry is that the taste of spice (I think it is bay leaves) really bring the green curry's taste out.  

BTW, they have pretty good home made dipping sauce for different dishes.  The best one is the one that goes with the entree fresh Chips.  Good taste of peanut in it (possible mango sauce in it).  Also, the sweet and sour level of the sauce in the dish or in dipping sauce are just right, not too sweet that makes you thirsty and not too sour that makes you mouth, throat and stomach feel bad.

Tried their tea, which has a special steep tea taste that is not quite the same as those bubble tea which is good but has a different.  I got to ask them what tea it is next time.  Too bad they have run out the dessert and leave with the fried ice-cream.

Although I have a long wait for lunch, because they don't have enough waiter and even chef yet (that's what the waiter told me), well, it seems that people either don't mind, or buy take out (even take out might take sometime if they are super busy, so you better prepare).  But you know good thing worth to wait.  BTW, they don't have a lot of tables (it is not a big restaurant), around 7 tables only.  They told me they will have delivery later, and because I am nearby, I can ask them to delivery to my office !!  Sure if you want good services on speed and many other big restaurant thing, you better don't come, but if you want good Thai Food, yes, I totally recommend this one.

BTW, go again on May 17, 2016 and eat their mango sticky rice dessert !!  Tasty along with sweet coconut sauce and mango, but be careful, it is very stuffy :P and you better share with 2 or 3 people at least.  BTW, not quite busy afternoon"}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and delicious. 

When we arrived, we thought the restaurant was empty but there's actually more seating in the back. 

They only had two servers working the last time I was here so there was a bit of a wait when it came to ordering or receiving our food. They were however, very apologetic and you can tell they were genuinely sorry about the wait. 

I got the green curry and my friend had the pad thai. It was very similar to what I had back in Thailand. The pad thai was made with just the right amount of tanginess so it is not overpowering. 

I definitely recommend coming here but just know that it will probably be extremely busy during dinner service."}
{"text":"You don't see many Thai places in Scarborough but glad we found this one. The Panang curry got finished first, would recommend this one. Spring rolls were good as was the eggplant. Tried the curry puffs which were decent but just not my cup of tea as it reminds me of samosas with a pastry type shell instead of flour. They were also cognisant enough to inform us that one of the dishes we ordered had fish sauce as we ordered everything veg. Nice to see as I think most other places wouldn't bother. I would go back if I'm in the area looking for Thai food!"}
{"text":"I found this place because of the good reviews on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised.

The Pad Prik Chicken is delicious and savoury. The shrimp doughnuts are amazing. Curry is fantastic. I'm working my way through the whole menu and have put this place in my regular rotation of restaurants. 

Plus they deliver which is an added bonus

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"this place has amazing food..almost as good as what you would find on the streets of Bangkok and Chiang Mai (Thailand)!"}
{"text":"Very generous portions that we had leftovers! Fair prices and great services. The first time we went they were all full and couldn't accommodate us. This time we went right when they opened and got a seat right away. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Finally! Such a great spot with authentic thai food! Had the panang shrimp curry and the pad kee Mao and chicken satay! Everything was delicious!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend :P  Had the red thai curry with chicken on coconut rice and it tasted awesome!!!  I ordered a thai ice tea and it has coconut milk in it :P  sweet :P  Overall, not too many selections as the menu is only 3 pages or so but it has wide variety of type of Thai food available to choose :P  Will come back for other food item next time :P  

One thing about it is that it is a very small restaurant and I am not sure if they take reservation..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give you a review of the food, but unfortunately I didn't get past the door.

I made a reservation for 4 over the phone for a Sunday evening, 2 days prior for my Mom's birthday.

However, when we arrived 5 minutes early to the reservation, the worried expression on the waittresses's face gave us pause. She said if we could a few minutes, which was fine since we were a bit early anyways. I also noticed that all the tables were all full.

5 mintues went bye, then 10, then 15. Still nobody had left and no word from our waittress.

Turns out that at kub khao, a reservation means absolutely nothing. I saw no \"Reserved\" sign on any of the tables.

Finally, hungry and frustrated we left to find another restaurant that could actually seat us. 

30 minutes AFTER the time we were supposed to be seated, they called me to tell me our table was ready! We were already happily seated at another restaurant so I told them to forget it. There's no way we would go back anyways.

Dear kub khao: if you are not able to take reservation, then don't take them! Don't take reservation and tell your customers \"see you then\" and then not actually reserve anything!

Obviously I have no comment on the food. Customer service dreadful."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, great atmosphere, and never a line up like you'd experience at Pai downtown. Especially recommend during lunch for their specials!"}
{"text":"My kids and I went here for dinner on a weekday.  We've  heard about this place a few weeks before it opened and was looking forward to trying out their dishes. It is located in an interesting spot - in a plaza by a gas station. It's a small restaurant -not recommended for large groups.  

We ordered a few apps to share - papaya salad, mango salad, chicken toast and the satay chicken.  Also ordered the one plate meal - fried garlic and egg with beef. 

Our fave dish was the chicken toast - it's a great starter dish - crunchy, not too heavy or oily.  The papaya salad had great flavours - sweet and sour with a spicy kick to it.  The mango salad is nice with some heat. The skewers were grilled perfectly with a nice peanut sauce to accompany it.  We enjoyed the one plate meal, the beef was delicately spiced and cooked just right.  The whole meal was delicious, affordable and enjoyable.  The service was quick and the server was attentive.  There was a steady stream of patrons ordering take-out and dining in.

I'm sure glad to discover and have a great Thai place close to home in the east end for us to enjoy. Kub Khao is a \"keeper\" restaurant in our list and will definitely recommend it to our friends and family.  We'll be back to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"Pad Thai and shrimp cakes were decent compared to the other dishes we tried, but not outstanding.

The holy basil beef with egg was so salty it was impossible to eat. The chicken toast which I ordered because quite a few reviews recommended it, was so oily. Literally deep fried bread drenched in oil. Gross.

Service wasn't great either. There were only 2 other tables there when we went for dinner and the server still forgot to put in our order...

Overall I don't think I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Im a returning customer and based on my past two dine-in experience at Kub Khao I would rate this place - 7/10 for food and 0/10 for service. Im not a picky person about service but this place is extremely short staff. I usually dont mind waiting to be seated or even waiting a bit for my food if I notice the restaurant is busy, but at Kub Khao, they have a small kitchen trying to serve a full restaurant PLUS Uber eats and takeout orders, u could be waiting for 45mins just for ur food, in my opinion I think thats a total waste of time (given the food isnt that great to make me wait that long). 

Reason why I rated 1 star
(i actually wanted to rate ZERO)

I came on a weekend evening (no reservation) with sudden crave for Thai food, arrived at around 7:50pm and was told I would have to wait for about 30+mins for a table, I said ok sure I'll wait, then after waiting for about 40mins, I asked one of the guys at the front counter whether theres a table available for us (because I see all other parties who have been waiting are already seated), the guy said \"well they made reservations\" \" its a busy day\", Im like ok..Im gonna wait a bit longer, finally at 9:05pm (this is 1hr 15mins after I've been waiting) one of the waitress comes out smiling and said \"Oh sorry we wont have any table available\" ....I TOTALLY went on fire!! WHY the heck didnt you tell me earlier?!?! and made me waited like a fool for 90mins(!!!) and then being told your restaurant wont be serving me cuz theres no table. I have to emphasize the waiter/waitresses there NEVER mentioned they dont have a table available throughout the 90mins I've been waiting. 

If you ask me about service? Rating is ZERO.

Even from previous experiences at Kub Khao, I would not rate this place anything higher than 3 stars out of 5 (food / service) But after my last experiece, definitely ZERO, will NEVER return again."}
{"text":"Had their chicken pad thai special for today. Lunch special comes with spring roll and mango salad. 
Verdict: Good but way to sweet for a pad thai. I hope they tone down on sweetness just a little bit. Authentic flavour and they don't add ketchup to flavour it. You can tell they put tamarind on it. Spring roll has mushroom/noodles inside. I love the mango salad. It is refreshing! Be aware though that lunch time is very busy. Come for early lunch or late lunch. Will come back for some other specials. Paid $9.89 tax and tip included. Worth it compared to eating at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I've only done take out but the food is delicious!!  Comparable pricing when it comes to Thai food, but definitely one of the more authentic places in the area.  We always get a pad thai and either the Khao Soi or a Red or Yellow Curry.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place! 
The interior design is quite weird though. The area where there are windows and faces the outside looks darker and not as inviting, and usually no one sits there, however if you walk inside to the other room, that's where the magic is. Everyone situates in there and it is nicely lit with really nice Thai designs. I found this very weird as I thought it woulda been the other way around to attract customers walking by.

Anyways, on to the food. I've tried the Panang Curry, Green Curry, and Pad Thai and man those were all delicious. The curries comes with a decent sized bowl of rice, but you can always order extra rice. The Thai Iced Tea is also extremely refreshing. Highly recommend.
Cannot wait to come back and try their other stuff, specifically the Mango Sticky Rice!"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery yesterday. We were told that our food will arrive in 40 minutes. 40, 50 minutes, an hour passed, our food NEVER ARRIVED. I decided to call & ask where our food was, no response. They called back after 5 minutes, only to tell us that we were out of the delivery area. So I asked if we can pick up the food, or is the food ready at least. The girl said, \"umm, we didn't make the food\" THEY NEVER MADE OUR FOOD, BUT NEVER CALLED TO TELL US THAT THEY COULDN'T DELIVER BECAUSE WE WERE OUT OF THE AREA!!!Are you kidding me??? We have been WAITING AN HOUR FOR OUR FOOD, BUT NO COURTESY TO EVEN CALL TO LET US KNOW THERE WAS NO FOOD COMING??? TERRIBLE BUSINESS. They simply said sorry we were too busy!  So upsetting!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai lunch special which came with a spring roll and mango salad. The flavouring of the pad Thai and the mango salad were great. Definitely would recommend it. 

We also ordered the chicken satay. I found that it wasn't that flavourful, maybe I don't know how Thai style satays are like. 

And lastly, we ordered the holy basil with egg as per the waitress's recommendation. It came last when we were pretty full already. They could have timed the dishes more closely. I wasn't too impressed with this. It's mostly just ground beef that's slightly spicy and quite salty."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious Thai food. Odd location. Great lunch deals. Seating on the stools in the back are not very comfortable.  I guess it was too cold to be seated in the front."}
{"text":"Great service and portion!  Such a hidden gem in Scarborough. Grilled pork skewer was very juicy and tender while the spicy veggie eggplant had the perfect amount of sweetness and heat. The flavor on the Pad thai was good,  just a little soggy. Would defintely go again!"}
{"text":"Came here to try dinner on Sunday night at around 6pm.  It was very full then but luckily we were seated after a short while.  The restaurant is located in a small plaza with very limited parking.  But it is worth it to come try this restaurant.  

Tried 2 appetizers, the chicken toasts and skewers.  Both were delicious especially the chicken toasts.  For entree, we tried the pad thai, curry, sukiyaki noodles and beef fried egg rice dish.  I have to say my favourite was the pad thai and curry.  Very flavourful and made me want more.  The sukiyaki noodles was a bit misleading for me.  It tasted good but it didn't taste like it was sukiyaki sauce.  The beef fried egg rice dish was the same, good but nothign special.  I had wanted to try their dessert but was so full that I have to come back to try it again next time."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Thai Restaurant in Scarborough in a plaza where a gas station is located. Had lunch with a couple of friends and we decided to try a few dishes to share. There was no one when we first arrived but it got pretty busy within 30 mins. 

Ordered shrimp chips to start. They were really good! Fresh and crispy and not excessively oily. It came with a peanut sauce to dip. 

The highlight dish we had was the Vegetarian Green Curry. (Tofu and Eggplant) Generous portions, excellent flavour, and omg so good. Sometimes I find the coconut taste in the curry too overpowering but this was perfectly balanced. I ended up even dipping my shrimp chips in the sauce because it was just that good. 

We also had the Pad Thai - which was good but it was like any typical Pad Thai that I've had, Fried Chicken Sticky Rice - which was 4 chicken wings with a side of Sticky Rice. Again I ended up adding the curry sauce for these 2 dishes because I couldn't get enough of the curry. 

I ordered a Thai Ice Tea as well. A little overly sweet and strong milky taste but all in all still very good. 

Looking forward to trying a different curry the next time I go back."}
{"text":"Great food and environment. The service was really slow though. Recommend their Penang curry and mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"This place looks deceving from the outside, once you go inside the decor is very Thai like, ask for a seat in the back as it's brighter and has more of a Thai feel.

Ordered the Green Curry and Pad Thai, the curry was a bit sweet for my liking but the pad that was done well.

Overall it was okay but, would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"It looks like a pretty small place from outside but has quiet a bit of room in the back, they are pretty busy during peak dinner hours. The food is delicious. We ordered the roasted duck curry and pad prik chicken, both spicy but worth tanking the heat. The roasted duck was super tender in the curry. Def recommend"}
{"text":"** Previous review had some billing concerns that have since been clarified. Errors were made by both parties (myself and the waiter). The rest of the review remains as-is. ** 

Shrimp Doughnut - Was a generous portion for this shareable app.  Heck, if you love shrimp but are a light eater, this may even do as your main. The sweet chilli sauce it came with however, lacked flavor.  Needs a bit more kick, in my opinion.  4/5.

Khao Soi - This one I was excited for as the only other place I go for this dish is Downtown.  Had the chicken version and it was actually quite delicious.  Not as good as the one I've had Downtown but good enough that I'd order it again. 4/5.

Green Curry - My friend ordered this with chicken and it was delicious.  Was a very hearty and generous serving. Also had just the right amount of heat.  Something I'd definitely order again. 5/5. 

Deep Fried Ice Cream - Presentation-wise, it was beautiful and even looked high-end. It was however, quite heavy.  Definitely a shareable serving, but it could use more flavoring. Perhaps more chocolate sauce or something. If you're looking at the price, it was worth it for the size.  But not so much the taste. 3/5.

Grilled Bread with Custard - The grilled bread, especially the charred parts were good.  The drizzled custard was delicious.  Definitely the star of the plate.  My friend asked for extra as the amount of drizzle wasn't enough, ratio-wise. 3/5."}
{"text":"WOW I'm impressed! I had a craving for Thai food but most of the Thai places are a bit far from my area. Then I found this place that I had no idea was around the corner from me and had great reviews. 
I decided to stop in and it was really busy with all tables occupied and a line up for take out and Uber Eats drivers. 
I ordered Chicken Satay and Chicken Pad Thai Spicy and the gentleman working the front was very friendly and polite. I took a seat on the ledge near the window to wait for my food and surprisingly it only took about 15 minutes and it was ready. 
When I got home the food was still nice and hot and they even wrapped the satay in foil to keep it warm. 
The meat was tender and delicious with nice peanut sauce for dipping. 
The Chicken Pad Thai was fantastic with just the right amount of chicken and spicy with a generous portion of crushed peanuts and bean sprouts. 
Overall I'm very impressed with this restaurant and the service I received. 
I will most certainly be going back here for lunch, dinner, and take out. 
I was so hungry I almost forgot to take a picture of my Pad Thai so it's a 3/4 eaten photo...lol."}
{"text":"Kub Khao Thai Eatery serves up delicious thai curries. The place is a bit small and sometimes wait times for sit-in dining are long on weekends. I docked a star due to one semi-unpleasant experience here. On a busy Friday night, I had ordered two dishes. One had come and the other took forever. A while later, the waitress picks up the curry dish from another table, asks if they touched it, and when they responded no, she came over and put it on my table and explained she made a mistake. I was shocked that she would take a dish after it was on another table for at least 10 minutes and try to serve it to me. I refused to take it. A lady from kitchen came out and apologized, and made me a fresh dish. She also removed it from my bill. The waitress definitely needs more training and common sense, but I am happy that other staff handled the situation well."}
{"text":"Service - very friendly despite being super busy. You'll have to flag them down every now and than to get some attention for whatever u need, they try to stay on top of things though but it is crazy busy. 

Food - Amazing! Very flavorful. You gotta get the larb. It was so good I forgot to take a picture. They ran out of the grilled banana when we got there and steam bread custard by time we were ready for dessert. Get your dessert and eat it first the moment u get there!

Reservations are a must. It's just crazy busy and we saw people willing to wait in their cars for an hour or getting delivery to go."}
{"text":"Decent, standard priced food with nice presentation in a fun and thoughtful space sums up my experience of Kub Khao. 

Stopped in for lunch and picked something from their combo, available from 11AM - 3PM, which includes soup or salad options. I selected the mango salad and it came with surprise deep fried chicken dumplings. 

As a vegetarian my partner polished these off, but he urged me to try the fried dumpling wrapper and it was delicious, very thin and crispy, making it taste quite light for deep fried. 

My main course, was a tofu and vegetable Pad Thai. As another reviewer mentioned, it's not the red ketchupy kind that you can get stuck with, which is much appreciated. I especially liked the minute tofu cubes and how they were cooked, which added a nice texture to the noodles. 

My partner opted for the chicken sticky rice combo, which unfortunately didn't come with an appetizer, but he enjoyed it nonetheless. We also ordered Thai iced tea and though it's a tad pricey in comparison to the food (approx $4 when your entrée is around $9), it was very yummy. 

Though I was at first leery about the place after reading reviews regarding service, I didn't have any issues personally during my visit. I was happy with my meal, service was courteous and efficient,  and I will definitely revisit and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening for a group of 6 girls, I had seen pics of the place from a friend and drove by several times but finally got a chance to try it.
It's a hidden gem inside a ghetto little strip plaza situated literally in a gas station..
When I walked in to meet my girlfriends I was a little alarmed as it was 30 degrees this particular day and there was no AC! I freaked out a little since I was the one who suggested this place. There were large fans but the sun was beating down on us...once we got our Thai iced teas and started chatting we almost forgot that it was so hot.
The food is good...4 of the girls opted for pad Thais (tamarind based sauce..saucy and savoury), I got the tumthad platter with grilled chicken, papaya salad, pork rinds, sticky rice and shrimp chips...presentation is good...see pics. And it.tasted good..we have been to Thailand and reminisce of the food all the time! The other girls got a fried curry chicken...also good...everyone pretty much was satisfied with their meals. And it was inexpensive...ranging from 10 to 15 dollars.
I will def return with the hubs as I was raving to him that we finally have a good Thai place close to home. Hopefully they get AC working..not sure if it was just a bad day...as I assume restaurants must have some climate control for health and safety...but hey...it added to the whole Thai feel:)"}
{"text":"Sister to Jatujak, Kub Khao is the Jan to Jatujak's Marcia. In terms of the food, anyway. Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! 

Kub Khao's decor and interior is prettier. I was thankful for the portable air conditioner unit, which made it considerably more comfortable to dine in. The service was really nice, personable, and attentive. 

The menu is more extensive, with new dishes in addition to the Jatujak regulars. Somehow, even the usual beef penang tastes different though - less flavour, more runny curry. We noticed the lack of curry leaves that Jatujak usually uses. Was that the difference in flavour? Ditto the roast duck curry, with the duck slices being a bit on the dry side. 

Since it's still quite new, am hoping the kitchen will eventually add whatever's in the usual stuff. I have hope in you yet, Kub Khao!"}
{"text":"Unusual location behind a random gas station and small plaza but nonetheless I enjoyed my time. Food was extremely tasty! I really recommend ordering the Thai iced tea and chicken toast with sweet chilli sauce."}
{"text":"Where else can you find a resto by a gas station but in Scarborough??? There's more room in the back of the house so seat yourself back in the cozier area if it's not busy. We went on a Wednesday night. Place is nicely decorated. Like you forget you're in Scarborough for a minute  I say this but I have so much love for my hood!

Anywho, we opened up with the shrimp donut. My husband and I wanted something different we don't normally see in a Thai resto and it didn't disappoint. I really like the vinegar based dipping sauce they served with it.

We shared the chicken pad Thai and panang curry. I enjoyed the curry more than the pad Thai. I mean- I'm intrigued with the rest of the menu. Descent price and the portions are fine with me though for those who like larger family sharing style portions may be disappointed. I will come back and try other items because this spot caught my attention.

If you want an introduction to Thai food without being intimated or scared of the food being too \"spiced \" then try my dishes. I'll let you know how the other dishes go ;) even still, glad to have more Thai options in the Scarbs!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to dine in and needless to say , my thoughts remains the same . 

Food is always great and the curry leaves you wanting more . When you dine in , the portions are more generous and they give you extras such as fried wontons for the soup . 

Although the staff aren't exactly fluent in English , communication shouldn't be an issue . The staff are really courteous and come by quite a few times to check up which I appreciate . Definitely a must try if you want great Thai food without having  venture downtown"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. The food was tasty and amazing value.
I had Pad Khing Chicken and it came with rice, spring roll and Mango salad, all for 7.95$.
The chicken was very flavorful, and the presentation was nice too.
The mango salad was very well done.
Spring roll was okay.
For the price you can't get any better.
I packed a Panang Veg curry takeout for the wife and I ordered it spicy(my mistake), so it was way too spicy for us. We know better for next time.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pad See Ew was good, but the Tom Yum Soup was watered down and lacked spices. The Thai iced tea was way too sweet,...but again just as it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai via Grub Hub a few weeks ago.  I love Pad Thai and order it often.  I assumed that since this restaurant was in an Asian dominated area that it would be excellent.  I was wrong.  The noodles were mushy and slimy.  The only good part about this dish was the tofu, which there were very few of.  I wasn't able to finish the dish as I began feeling ill.  I would not recommend the Pad Thai, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and loved the food.  I've been here about 3 times now and the food is very good and has great value.   My friend and I both ordered the Red Pineapple Curry lunch which includes either mango salad or soup with chicken won tons for $10  and it was delicious. Shrimp chips are excellent and not the pastel coloured chips we are use to which are served with yummy peanut sauce.  I also ordered Thai ice which is a must when you visit. 

Service is a bit slow since there was only one server during the lunch rush, but she was kind and attentive.  There is a back extension which is great but can get cramped.  You do hear other people's conversations.  They do play music but it sometimes stopped.

Regardless the food is great.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is the smallest little restaurant tucked away (weirdly) into a gas station.  It's a cozy place with clean decor and you will certainly see people getting gas directly outside the door. 

The menu is a simple 2 page menu with 10 or so options for each of appetizers, rice/noodle, curry, etc.  The staff here is quite friendly and will recommend items on the menu.  On their recommendation I ordered chicken toast - this sounds odd at first but it's literally a piece of chicken on french toast.  This, along with our other food, came out very hot and I was very eager to try them.

I found the curry to be a bit on the sour side, but I like that you can add veggies, pork, beef, chicken, or shrimp to it."}
{"text":"Best Thai Place in Town!

Food: 5/5 Wonderful curry. Pad Thai is good also.
Service: 5/5 Friendly.
Environment: 3.5/5 Seats not the most comfortable.
Washrooms: 4/5 Okay.
Worth it?: 5/5 Great snack while at the market.

This is easily my favorite Thai place around. I highly recommend any of their curry's. I personally like the Red curry with chicken. I used to prefer the duck but the chicken seems to taste fresher more consistently. I've had a few other things like there pad Thai which is good as well. There mango sticky rice dessert is amazing!

The environment is a bit old but cute it into own way. The back area is a nice hang out spot though the chairs could use work. 

Service is very nice here. I always feel welcome and love coming back!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing!! I always go for their pad Thai, papaya salad, mango sticky rice and Thai ice tea. Absolutely delicious and never disappoint me!!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place, if he didn't, I would have never noticed it. It's behind a gas station with little parking, kind of tucked away.

My friend and I both got Khao Soi (I know, you're not supposed to order the same thing but I was really craving it). I got the chicken, he got the beef and both asked for extra spicy. My gosh was it spicy, nice kick but after felt like you were getting kicked in the face. It was good and portions were decent but for ~$13 would have been nice if they can offer it as a combo with a side or a drink.

The server was nice but was barely around. The place is small so can get busy. I usually go downtown for Thai food but I guess I can come back when downtown isn't within reach."}
{"text":"Lovely place run by Thai people. At first it was weird when we pulled into the plaza because we thought it was just a gas station but this is really a gem.

Satay chicken skewers were delicious! Even before you dip it in the satay sauce. Then the sauce...the peanuty goodness...to die for.

The soup is simple but the flavours made me nostalgic of my cousins' cooking in Bangkok.

The mango salad was not sour. Many placed have used under ripe mangoes but this was perfect.

Pad Thai is perfectly made. You actually taste the tamarind.

Pineapple curry, not too sweet nor spicy. Perfect creaminess. 

Mango sticky rice was so good..! Especially paired with the cashews! 

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We were feeling for some Thai cuisine for our last lunch of 2016, so we decided to check this place out! We went on NYE for lunch at around 1pm. We were able to sit down right away. It looks like a small restaurant, but can sit about 60 people. There are more tables in the back! (I couldn't see before!) But it wasn't that busy when we arrived. The server was a sweet woman, she was very nice to help recommend what to try! The service here is fast and amazing! We got our foods within 10 minutes, starting with our drinks & appetizers.
~
{Thai Ice Tea}
We both loveeeeee Thai ice tea!! but a lot of places we've tried at tend to make it overly sweet, and they can't make it less sweet for some reason. My girlfriend told me this restaurant actually serve less sweetened ice tea!!  This was pretty much the only reason why we decided to check out this restaurant!!  We requested one regular sweet, and one less sweet. The regular sweet level one actually wasn't too bad!! I love that they don't put too much sugar in, I find that it masks the other flavours when there's too much sugar! 
The tea flavour is a wonderful Jasmine aroma, and the coconut milk is very creamy, but not too overpowering. It completely compliments the delicate jasmine tea flavour. This is probably the best ice tea we've ever tried. Next I wanna go try their ice coffee, I heard it's pretty good as well! 


{Southern Fried Chicken Wings}  
The fiancé was so interesting in trying the southern fried chicken wings. He's a wing man.  (Get itttttt? LOL) The appetizer dish came with the fried shallots on top of the wings, a tamarind dipping sauce. The wings were perfectly fried, and still very VERY juicy!!  He LOVED the batter they used, it's very similar to his favourite Vietnamese fried chicken wings at Pho Cuu Long Mien Tay!!  He was so impressed, he didn't see this flavour taste bud slap coming!!  I didn't try the sauce, although I wish I had. Fiancé said it was sweet, with some tart flavour and a little chilli taste! He loved it so much!! He will definitely be back for the wings! 

{Tom Kha Soup}  
I ALWAYS order tom yum soup, but I had a sore throat, so I wanted to try something that didn't have too much spices in it. I ordered the Tom Kha soup with tofu and vegetables. It looks like a creamy soup, but when tasted it's like a shock to your taste buds!! The sour flavour was strong, but I frigging loved it!! I'm a sour food loving foodie. It tasted almost like the regular tom yum soup, but without the spicy flavour! I also loved the coconut aroma from the soup as well. This soup so tart and so goooood!! 

{Pad See Ew with Beef}  
I've only tried pad see ew once, but I remembered it was pretty good. So I decided to try it at this restaurant. The first thing I noticed was the type of noodles they used, I thought they would use ho fan. But they actually used a different kind of flat rice noodles. This kind is the rice noodle that I LOVE! It's almost like a sheet of rice noodle but cut in a triangular form. The noodle itself was cooked al dente, giving this dish some texture. The flavour though oh my gawwwwwwj, it's delicious!!! The way they stir fried it, I don't even know what else they put in there. It says they use soy sauce to make it but I'm sure they have another secret ingredient. It's umami AF!!! Completely blew my mind when I took my first bite. It's not too salty, but it's multidimensional AF. Became my favourite dish at first bite!  Not to mention they are very generous with their beef. I couldn't actually finish  all the meat because there was so much. 

{Khao Soi} 
The nice server lady recommend my fiancé to try the Khao Soi; fried egg noodles on top, with flat rice noodles and beef (chicken is also an option) in a spicy coconut milk curry broth with bean sprouts and pickled cabbage. He said the curry had a sweet and creamy flavour, but had a kick to it.  He loved the flavour of the curry broth! The only thing was he wished the noodles had more texture to it, it was slightly over cooked for his preference. Other than that he said it's a very complexed savoury dish! A definite must try for others!!  This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem, it became our favourite spot for Thai food!! :D"}
{"text":"Came to this place while we are in Scarborough and thought to give it a try, the r place located in a gas station plaza almost inside the gas station, be easy to miss if we weren't looking for this place specifically .

Inside the restaurant there are 2 sections: front and the back, the back section is semi hidden and decor is  nicer then in the front, it's also cooler in the back section in summer time than the front.  The back section also gets filled up really fast 

We ordered the green curry chicken and the beef pad Thai.  The dishes came out relatively quickly (5 min)

Green chicken Curry : the sauce has relatively good texture, however flavor is on the sweeter side. Chicken strips not as tender as we would like, a little on the tough side. For green curry i personally prefer the stronger coconut milky taste, and this dish is relatively blend in flavor for my preference. 

Beef Pad Thai :  also too sweet for flavor,  the noodle is cooked perfectly though..with just the right amount of chewiness. Only after lime and some hot sauce to the noodles did it taste more balanced. 

Both dishes are not spicy at all, good news for those that prefer no spicy on their dishes."}
{"text":"Interesting shrimp donuts. Curries, pad thai ok. I am unsure if they use kaffir lime leaves as it is not as prominent in their dishes. Still a great Thai place within Scarborough."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite restaurants to visit on a regular basis! The restaurant is located in a sketchy looking plaza with an old gas station and looks a bit run down. Initially when I had visited the restaurant with my family, we were put off by the location - BUT don't let that stop you from some delicious food. The restaurant offers several dishes - menu could be explained and laid out better. The dishes are full of flavour and are decent portions. I've had the pad Thai a few times and enjoy it quite a bit. Their fried rice has amazing smokey flavour. 

Definitely worth checking out. It was one of our favourite go to spot on the weekends but the service is hit or miss. Sometimes, depending on who the workers are, service is great. The gentleman who runs the floor is very attentive - but the girls are too preoccupied on their phones and sitting around instead of making sure customers are looked after."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and was excited to see this place in my area on the \"Hot New Businesses\" list on Yelp. 

Food: I went today with my Mom for lunch. We both had the chicken pad thai lunch special. I order pad thai 90% of the time when I order Thai food, so I feel that I know good pad thai. This was good pad thai. 

Service: As other Yelpers have mentioned, the service is really slow. We got there at 1:45pm, and the place was empty except for one group of four people. There was no one at the front desk and we stood there for 5 minutes before knocking on the kitchen door to get someone's attention. After we were seated, it then took a little while longer for our orders to be taken. When it came time to pay the bill, we had to ask one of the cooks to ask our server to bring the bill. I can't imagine how long the wait would be when this place is busy. 

I would go back for the pad thai, but I would get takeout."}
{"text":"Spent a week in Toronto and this is the best restaurant we have eaten!!  Everything was fantastic - even the dessert!!"}
{"text":"A decent place to go if you're not looking to head downtown for Thai food. The restaurant is located in a strip mall that is connected to a gas station. My view out of the window was cars getting gas, which I found quite different. 

The staff are friendly and the waitress was very attentive to when we needed more water (which comes in a cute looking glass jar). The restaurant is split up into two sections: the front being regular seating and the back is a more traditional feel like the chairs and decorations. 

I do have to note that the menu and cups were sticky... this was a big downfall. 

We ordered the crispy chicken wontons as a starter. The wonton was crispy and the chicken was flavourful and soft inside. 

The Tum Thad is a one plate meal that comes with a papaya salad, grilled chicken, sticky rice, and shrimp chips. The papaya salad was tangy where you can taste the fish sauce. The grilled chicken was flavourful and tender. Overall, it is something I recommend ordering to get different kind of experience than say, curry. This is because it comes in a straw plate which is cool.

The Pad Thai Chicken Quick Lunch special (11 AM - 3 PM) comes in a smaller portion than the regular, but it is definitely still sufficient as a large portion. It also comes with a salad or soup as well as spring rolls. The salad is a mango salad. It had a strong fish sauce taste and one bite was actually really spicy, I'm not sure if there was a hot pepper inside. Overall, it was a refreshing mango salad that was just alright. The Pad Thai came with tofu, chicken, rice noodles, bean sprouts, chives, tamarind sauce, and ground peanut. It wasn't very tasty at all. It had more of a soy sauce flavour and was actually quite oily. I expected better for a Thai restaurant.

The mango sticky rice is a seasonal item (as stated on the menu). It comes with 4 cashews and some ground peanuts. The sticky rice wasn't too soft or hard which was good. However, it was a bit too sweet. 

Overall, a decent place to go to for Thai food if you live uptown."}
{"text":"Good service , good food and nice environment. Place is more spacious then it appears as there is a back room with more seating . As does take out. Definitely best around the area"}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty and the service was great, however I couldn't help but notice what seemed to be the coldest draft ever in this place, which lead me to believe that the vicinity isn't energy efficient lol in that there was an electric heater rotating on a chair directed at my table for added warmth! 

That put me off a bit knowing that maybe my food would get cold quicker and my nose ended up getting a bit congested after sadly. Other than that, the server was completely forthcoming and friendly, but she kept running to and fro so it appeared that they were understaffed at this point. The place wasn't packed, but the ambiance was still fairly average to loud. 

For starters, we ordered the skewers, accompanied by a sweet sauce. Truthfully I didn't like the sauce cause it didn't coat the skewers as much as I would've liked - could be more thicker; and we also had the shrimp donuts which I thought would be hard! But they were very soft with a little crunch, again accompanied by a sweet sauce. I ordered a tofu and egg with veggie pad thai but it didn't garner much tofu.. And my guest, a regular pad thai with beef and peanuts.

I will also note that the food came out very quickly, which surprised me but also wowed me since my guest and I were hungry and overall I would come back again and would like to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Kub Khao is a good Thai spot in the GTA!  From
The pad thai, massaman curry, shrimp cakes and vegetarian dishes, they were all pretty good. As with most place, they cater to your spice level. The portion sizes were great! The staff was pleasant. The spices- good. The thai iced tea- good.  I'm just happy I don't have to go all the way downtown (or drive more than 15 minutes) to get decent Thai food.

You walk in and it's nothing big, until you walk to the back where there's nice artwork.

It's in the older strip plaza next to this chicken shop."}
{"text":"This is probably the most authentic Thai restaurant in Toronto AND the prices are actually reasonable. Although I was born and raised in Toronto, I am of Laotian descent, so I have had my share of Lao/Thai dishes (if that sort of thing matters to you). 

I was skeptical when my coworker introduced me to this place. I said, \"What?!? There's a good Thai restaurant in scarborough?!\" I couldn't believe it. 

Anyway, as I pulled up to the sketchy plaza it was in, a smile came across my face. As most of you know, good Pho restaurants are normally located in ghetto plazas too. So I had a glimmer of hope. 

We walked through the front doors, and yup, it seemed a bit ghetto, but they told us to have a seat in the back. Another pleasant surprise; it was actually nice back there. They had some Thai style paintings, art and decor in the back which was a nice touch. I'm not sure why the front does not look cohesive though. 

Anyway, I've been here a couple of times now and we were able to order on and off the lunch menus. Everything was good! Curries, rice, noodles, appetizers. No one had a complaint. Can't beat home cooked, but it's pretty darn close. 

The one thing that did disappoint me was Thai iced coffee (-1 Star). It tasted like garbage, instant coffee. Bleh, I won't order another beverage from here. Which is unfortunate. 

However, I will be back for the food. I'll be back here with my lunch crew. Will also try the dessert next time. I could only find photos from our second visit, I'll try to make an update when I eventually return"}
{"text":"A little gem hidden behind the gas station. 
The food was great and lunch prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food up in the Scarborough burbs. It does its job when you are craving some authentic Thai food. 

I've been here a couple times and tried a few things on their menu - chicken toast, papaya salad, pad Thai, pineapple curry chicken and tum thad.

Chicken toast - one of their appetizers. Although it has an interesting name, the taste is great. Don't really know what it is but it is delicious!

Papaya salad - a favourite of mine. It has the tangy fish sauce taste and is super refreshing with the a great crunch. The peanuts also add a lot to the flavour of the dish. Huge portion as well - it is best shared though I feel like I could eat it all by myself as a main.

Pad Thai - solid dish. You can't go wrong with  ordering this. It has a tangy flavour and comes in a huge portion. The down side is it comes with raw bean sprouts which I am not a fan of. Also, if you want meat, you have to add $2. I usually go with the tofu and veggie option since I can never finish the order anyways.

Pineapple chicken curry - one of their curries that is not marked spicy. Flavourful, creamy and the perfect amount of kick for someone who can't take spice well. The portion is decent as well - comes with lots of chicken.

Tum Thad - a \"platter\" that has grilled chicken, sticky rice, hard boiled egg, shrimp chips and papaya salad. Definitely looks good in pictures and tastes are on par as well. It's a great variety of food as you get a taste of everything. The sticky rice has no flavour but works well when eaten with the grilled chicken and the tamarind sauce it comes with. The shrimp chips are standard... They taste better than store bought ones for sure. My favourite is the papaya salad, they give a decent portion in the platter so that's definitely a plus for me.

I've also heard great things about their other dishes so I'm sure I will be back again to try others. One of my friends though did find their curries and Khao soi a bit watery like soup. 

The place is not too big so it can get busy, making reservations are your best bet. I also find that they seat tables weirdly - they have what I called benches and what time they seated my party with one person sitting at the corner of the end of the bench and the rest on chairs."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

This is the sister restaurant to Jatujak and co-owned by ex-Khao San Road. Currently seeing quite a line up with an average wait time of 30 minutes.

Ordered their beef red curry so that I could make a comparison with some of the other favourable Thai restaurants. I would say that this falls short in terms of the taste that Jatujak and Khao San Road brings. I requested the spicy version but it was not really that spicy at all. It was in fact more on the coconut-milky sweet side. As well, flavour profile was less in depth than Jatujak and the beef was not as tender. It was still a decent curry but definitely not to the level that I was expecting.

Also it was evident that they had quite a service slow down that day. Many of the folks who ordered take out had to wait for upwards of 30-45 mins for their food to come out."}
{"text":"This is relatively new little place got about 26 seats! Good food and service! Fast and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I think I came here with super high expectations, or I was craving some thai food badly. Maybe we were late for our food pick up, so some of the items probably didn't hold up well to waiting for us in a plastic bag (poor chicken wings). But their curry certainly made up for it. I was in love with their green curry (we got it with beef). The spice level and the flavours made my mouth water. I also ordered the red curry as a tofu dish, which was nice as it had a large variety of vegetables in it. The curry itself was quite sweet though, and very creamy. 

The pad thai was sticky and soggy, which was a disappointment. It came with a good amount of veggies and peanuts and chicken, but the noodles all clumped together which made it hard to share.

A lot of the food overall was on the sweet side. The sauces with the appetizers were all very sweet, the pad thai was more sweet than sour, and the red curry was far too sweet for our liking. The green curry was the star of the show, and the satay chicken skewers rounded it out with it's smooth tender meat. Overall, the place is okay, but it's not top of my list for thai food in the city."}
{"text":"Curry chicken noodle soup.   We thought we'd have leftovers but we couldn't resist finishing it all.    Delish!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Tuesday, the restaurant is hidden behind a gas station so if you're driving from the west on Sheppard, turn right at Amethyst street so you don't miss it. We ordered from the lunch menu. Pad Thai Chicken ($8.95) comes with soup/salad and an appetizer. My husband got the grilled pork with sticky rice ($8.95) and I ordered a Thai iced tea ($3.95). The food is really good, by far one of the most authentic I've had in Toronto without going downtown and paying for ridiculous prices. Other items on their menu looked good as well, will be back again with more people next time during dinner so I can order more variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. Will definitely be going regularly. The food is priced right. Will 100% recommend the place for authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and I haven't been disappointed yet. The first time I came I had the pas Thai and roasted duck curry! The curry was definitely my favourite of the two. There was lychee in the curry to balance out the roasted flavor and it was overall a delicious dish. Needless to say, the second time I came to Kub Khao, we had the roasted duck red curry and the masaman curry! Both were really good. The masaman curry definitely had more chicken than the roasted duck red curry. Both were very good and we had ordered an extra bowl of rice. The Thai iced tea and the Thai coffee were also very refreshing. If you don't like sweet iced tea, the Thai Iced Tea is definitely very sweet! 

Overall, the quiet and quaint atmosphere plus food is enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"If you like San khao road, you will like this place. Super tasty food at reasonable prices. We went to this place for lunch on a week day. Got seated right away. 

We ordered two items from the quick lunch menu: the pan wood san beef (glass noodle) and the pad thai chicken. Both came with spring rolls and a choice of salad or soup. Everything was delicious and very fresh. The mango salad could benefit from riper mango, but it was still pretty good. 

The only reason I am not giving it a five star is because of the service. The upside is that the servers were fast and attentive. However, there were some language issues which led to some confusion over what we had ordered and who ordered what. So, they need to work on the service, but the food is really wonderful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was good, reasonably priced however, the service was a little slow. Definitely understaffed."}
{"text":"A really odd place for a restaurant. It's in a small plaza with a Money Mart and no name gas station. The view from our table was of the gas pumps--look at the picture. However, this place is great. 

The restaurant is small.  It has the front part where we sat, and brighter and cozier back. There were 2 staff (one at the cash register and another servicing). The service was great and fast given that one person served all the tables so I don't agree with the other reviews about slow service.  Maybe it's because we sat at the front near the entrance and kitchen with the great view so the the server was always there.

We had chicken skewers (quite tender), sticky rice with peanut sauce (very good), mango salad, green curry chicken, pad thai, egg plant, suki yaki noodles. All the dishes were tasty (everything had a slightly sweet tinge). We also ordered everything spicy which wasn't that very spicy--just enough.

The price if very fair. Our bill before tax was about  $70.

Parking. It is paid parking but the restaurant validates or just park in the plaza next door and grab a Starbucks coffee on the way back to the car.

I will definitely  go back.

I later learned that the chef used to cook at Khao San Road. That makes sense."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food here!  Friendly staff, great portions.  Would suggest sitting in the back of the restaurant as it delivers a better ambiance.  Dishes are generally on the sweeter side, but adding some fresh chillis to it will provide a much more balanced flavour. If you like spicy, ask the staff for some fresh crushed chillis!  This is truly a hidden gem in the city.  Keep up the good work Kub Khao Thai!"}
{"text":"When in doubt, I'm going out.... for thai. I can't get enough of this lovely place! Like everyone is saying in the reviews this is a gem! I eat here around 2-3 times a week. Always looking for something new so I had to try the chicken toast... I now order this every time I dine in. YOU NEED TO TRY THIS FANTASTIC PLACE!! I'M IN LOVE :D :D The owners asked if my friend and I wanted to take a picture for the photo wall..... 100% I said yes, I am now apart of the wall.... I feel like family."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim looking for good thai food. I was impressed with the flavours and ambiance of the place. The layout of the restaurant is surprising, as it is quite large and has seats in the back (which one may not expect from a quick look at the exterior). 

We ordered the chicken panang curry (red curry), vegetable spring roll (fried), and and basil chicken. The food was amazing and I will be coming again in the near future."}
{"text":"Definitely want to be back to this joint..it is a really no-frills place serving street Thai eats but in a very clean and cozy atmosphere. We only had time to try their pork skewers as a quick snack but they were still very tasty and good. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Little unsuspecting hole in the wall behind a gas station may not sound like a recipe for a good restaurant but don't let it fool you. The back of the restaurant looks like an authentic little place. I went for dinner ordering the roasted chicken platter with sticky rice, Kao soi and chilli shrimp paste fried rice. All decent portion in size and quiet little spot perfect for a dinner night out."}
{"text":"Super worth it to get the lunch deal! Chicken par thai with mango salad and a spring roll was $8.95. I preferred the Thai iced tea from other restaurants, but the meal itself was pretty solid, and still good even the next day when I wanted to save it for snack. They expanded the back area of the restaurant where all the lunch patrons were seated... it's a bit hidden but it's definitely where I would like to dine when I go there next. Gives a homey feel which I like. Hope to go there again soon for a simple flavourful meal...  delish!"}
{"text":"Terrible Valentine's Day.  Took us one and a half hour to get two dishes of food ( starter ) .   We end up went to the other place for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here this past Sunday and must say it is a hidden gem.   Don't let the location with the old gas station fool you, when it comes to great taste this place is on point. 

There isn't many tables and luckily we reserved.  The place gets quite busy and for good reason.  The Thai iced tea is delicious, great tea flavour and really refreshing.   

As for the food, we ordered a whole bunch of dishes.   We had chicken toast which is nice with the vinegar sauce it came with. Mango salad which is always refreshing with its shredded vegetables.  Khao soi which was not the best i had but it was good.  tum Thad (which I am not sure I was eating right, but I made mini tacos with all the toppings.   The egg was kinda pointless in the dish, wish it was more like a soy egg.  The roasted duck curry was really good so much flavour and would order again.  

There were a few other dishes as well that were ordered.  

For dessert we tried the deep fried I've cream, and the mango sticky rice.    Honestly you can't go wrong with either.  Both were very good.  

The staff at this place are very friendly and work as a team.

Will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The fried rice was good. But the pad thai is a little under my expectation.
Overall it's a good experience for having dinner there for the first time."}
{"text":"Lunch special are maaaaaad worth it....

$9 for a starter ( soup or mango salad) plus a spring roll..followed by a very generous portion for the mains. 

This was definitely not generic like the fast food chains (thai one on). There was a little more effort put into it. The dishes were prepared with time and effort. the presentation was nice as well. 

Its a very small place so seating is limited. So hopefully you get a seat!"}
{"text":"Great service located in a not so busy area very accessible I usually go for take out because I live right around there and the food since they've opened has always been spot on and never lacking! My fav the pad see ew medium spicy with chicken or the pineapple fried rice for the perfect fix."}
{"text":"Glad to see a decent Thai restaurant up in Scarborough. I would rank it somewhere between 3.5 and 4 star.

Khao Soi: not as good as the Khao San Road downtown. The broth lacks the depth, and is basically a coconut curry sauce. Beef has quantity, but lacks quality.

Pad Thai is good, so is their fried basa fillet with tamarind sauce. 

If you have room, try the mango sweet rice, pretty good for this time of the year."}
{"text":"Very happy to learn that they expanded the restaurant towards the back, and the seating there is really cozy! 
The additional washrooms in the back are an added bonus, because the original one in the front was really small and messy.

Good place for Thai food. Best deal is their lunch combo (11am to 3pm), where  $9-$10 will get you a main dish + appetizer (soup or salad).

Try it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza,  it doesn't look high end or fancy but man,  is this a great hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Recommended to go here by a friend from church and her recommendation lived out to my expectations. The food here is really good in presentation and taste.  Flavors of the food I ate was incredible,  loved the beef green curry and chicken Khao Soi and Pad Thai with shrimp. Service is quite decent, they brought the food out in a timely fashion. Would come again."}
{"text":"Valentine's day from hell. Not only for all of the guests but every staff member as well.

I would like to first mention what I over heard one of the staff members say to a guest of the restaurant. \" We are all messed up because the head chef didn't come in\". From my understanding the head chef is the owner of the restaurant. It's really sad to hear that the owner messed up about 50 people Valentine's day and did not even give his staff a chance to have a successful night by being well stocked with staff. There was one waitress working the entire floor, every table was full. It's a shame.

I guess we should start from the beginning. I ordered tea and it the waitress forgot to put a tea bag in, I was only served hot water. Took about 10 minutes to correct this mistake and receive a glass to drink the tea with. We ordered food about 15 minutes after being seated.
 Weirdly the main courses started coming out before all the appetizers. Would also like to mention that the plates were all cold as ice. We only recieved 3 out of 5 main dishes we ordered. Unfortunately it would take 1 HOUR AND 45 MIN until our 4th person would get their meal and finally eat. At this point there was people walking out of the restaurant because they have been waiting 45 minutes without even having their order taken. People were walking up to the kitchen and asking when their food is coming. People were begging to just pay their bill so they could leave. Kitchen staff and the single waitress were yelling back and forth. Delivery guys were coming in and complaining that they have been waiting for over 30 mins just to get the food to take out.

It was complete mayhem. It took over 3 hours to get our food and check out.

That being said the food was very good. It is just a pity that the owner let his staff down so miserably and that because of that every guest that night had a miserable experience.

Do not leave your special night in the hands of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried the chicken khao soi and Dom yum soup with tofu. The noodles in the khao soi came out too soft but still tastes good. Dom yum soup was good but really don't like the carrots."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining here a couple of times, each time was decent as the last. They offer a large variety of different unique dishes that I haven't seen elsewhere. They do noodle dishes and cook the protein quite well - I tend to have problems with other Thai places over cooking the chicken too many times. 

The pad sew is slightly different here as they use a really wide thick noodle that give the dish an interesting and foreign texture-the noodle is quite chewy and flavorful. I also love the chicken platter, the dark boneless chicken and papaya salad got a nice contrast of hot and cold, fresh and cooked going. 

The shrimp donuts were well worth the price. Filled with ground fresh shrimp paste covered with panko and deep fried. The crunchy exterior sealed in the juicy inside. It's worth noting that there seems to be no filter ingredients. Lovely partying with a fruity citrus dipping sauce.

The chicken curry noodle was bomb! So many flavor and contrasting texture at work. The crisp of the veggies bring a nice welcomed cooling effect to the spicy coconuty curry. The rice noodle was cooked to the right chewy consistency. The kafir lime leaves were a nice touch. 

Lastly, the fried chicken sticky rice was good. As expected, the chicken was well marinated, crispy batter. My only grievance was the wings they used may have came from a more mature chicken so the meat was moist but not as tender. We ordered a side of coconut sticky rice for kicks and enjoyed it quite a bit (slightly sweetened).

Overall, we haven't been disappointed. Love the food, service is decent. Definitely worth your while."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here twice and both times, they took the orders with extreme care and got everything ready in a matter of minutes. 
One of the orders was for a staff lunch event (17 individual orders) and they managed it with great attention to detail. 
I'm vegetarian and have had the red and green curries which were both very delicious and properly spicy too! 
Sadly, many of their other popular items contain fish sauce, so I couldn't try those. I would love to see them make adjustments to use a vegetarian base for some of the peanut based sauces."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Thai food I've tried so far in Toronto. Their lunch menus have some great deals. I always go for Pad Thai or Pad woon sen and mango salad. The Thai Iced Coffee is a must! The back of the store has some pretty cool designs with modern art mixed with traditional woven lamp shades. A cute place for a small party or dinner. It's a hidden gem in Scarborough. The main entrance may throw you off a little bit but the back of the store has some very comfortable seatings. Definitely recommend this restaurant! Food and service is always consistent! :D"}
{"text":"Finally came here to have a sit down dinner with a friend at Kub Khao. We got here relatively early and found a seat quickly. My friend's initial observation is, if I didn't bring her here she wouldn't have known about this place. So my first time here for a sit down dinner. I didn't realize how big the place is. Cause they got more seating in the back. 

Onto the food, we ordered a Beef Pad Thai, Chicken Green Curry and a Spring Roll. After trying their Pad Thai the 2nd time, I can still say I like the flavour as it is not over sweet with the sauce. By adding lime juice, peanuts and the bean sprout certainly brought out the flavour of the pad thai even more. But my new favourite is the Green Curry. It is rich in flavour, but not heavy. I can say both to the Pad Thai and Green Curry, neither of them felt heavy nor neither have strong after taste. Which is a plus in my books.

Overall, I will come back again for my fix in Thai food."}
{"text":"Most authentic place I've found since my Thailand visit. Even the fact that it's right outside a gas station! My most memorable meal in Thailand was a van next to a gas station lol. Had mango salad and if was the best I've ever had. Every dish was amazing."}
{"text":"Would've never noticed this restaurant if I hadn't seen it on Yelp! It's situated in a little strip plaza behind a gas station. 

The satay chicken appetizer came with 4 skewers and 2 different types of delicious sauces (peanut and sweet & sour). Despite the long wait for the food to come out, the skewers were room temperature when served, which was disappointing. In terms of taste, the chicken was tender, but definitely could've been marinated in satay sauce for longer to get a stronger flavour.

The pad thai was average. The noodles were slightly undercooked, making them really hard. The chicken was also extremely extremely dry! It was way too overcooked. The tamarind sauce would've been better if it had more of a tart flavour. I wouldn't recommend adding shrimp for $2 because my friend only got 3 pieces of medium-sized shrimp. 

Not sure if the chef was just having an off day, but I likely won't be back here."}
{"text":"My second time here. I'm not Thai, but this is definitely the most authentic Thai restaurant around the area. The place is on the smaller end, in a little plaza, so I think that's why it's not getting the attention it could deserve. The portions are pretty big, and the food is very flavorful. Go with a few friends, so you can order a number of dishes and try everything! There's only one person who is serving though, so if she's gone, you could wait for a while."}
{"text":"There's this awesome little Thai gem hidden at the corner of birchmount and Sheppatd, and it's really hidden even with GPS! Kind of hiding behind a gas station. 

When you walk in it seems very small, but there's lots of seating behind the restaurant. The interior is very cute and cozy with a rustic vibe. 

The food portions are a bit small, but full of flavour, pretty authentic and delicious. The mango sticky rice is a must have to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Is it just me or do others determine delicious Thai food based on excellent Larb ($9.95 beef, pork, or chicken)?  The medium spicy request seemed spot on as it had my adrenaline running just enough to see some things in slow motion such was the case of the waiter or let's call him a guy pretending to be one while we wait in each step of the service blueprint.

The two sections of the restaurant front & back is a bit unusual and questionable as to how they determine for me to sit in the crappy generic quick serve front end while the back had the settings of authentic Thai welcoming.  Maybe it was the hoodie and runners but it's scarborough comfort wear, but I doubt it's for any reason aside from just 'whatever'.

My companion had the Khao Soi ($12.95) which was fun to watch as the crispy noodles on top overwhelmed the bowl making consumption a challenging logistical mission, however the feedback was deliciousness, so there you go.  Larb is still one of my favourite memories of Thai cuisine and the flavours in this one had a nice balance that makes me go back for more.

Just make sure you have the waiter tracked on your GPS so the meal can start-to-finish according to plans.  Next, let's kick it up a notch to \"spicy\"."}
{"text":"Above average Thai joint in mid town (3.5). I came over the weekend, it was a bit difficult to find at first as it was beside a gas station. The staff were very pleasant despite    they served a broken glass cup. We ordered the following: for apps- chicken toast (couldn't really taste the chicken- nothing special), pork skewers which I thought were tasty and the tom yum soup (more sweet than sour- I would have liked it more if it was sour). For mains we tried the khao soi (beef was very dry), masaman curry with chicken (enjoyed the curry), and lastly pad Thai which I thought was the best. We also tried their Thai iced tea which was lacking in flavour and very watered down. For dessert we tried the mango sticky rice- it was okay the coconut was very runny. Overall I enjoyed the experience but it cannot beat pai or sabai sabai downtown taste wise."}
{"text":"I've been here two times now and I have to say both times my experience has been good. The food here is good. My particular favorites are the curries. The Pad Thai is also very good too. They have a meat salad called Larb. This is very good too. The last time I was here, I tried their Ginger tea. If you are a ginger lover, I would suggest you give it a try. 

The seating here is very homey in the back of the restaurant. However, although comfortable, if you are seating on the stools, there is no place for your coats and your bag. In the winter time, if you are near the doors, it can get a bit cold. 

The last time I was here, they were really busy. So we had to wait for quiet a bit of time for our food to come out. But, as we were too busy chit chatting, we didn't really notice. What caught us by surprise was that the server bought us a deep fried ice cream desert as a way to apologize for the wait. I have to say the service here is very good. In addition, when we asked for separate bills the ladies there were more than happy to split the bills for us. This to me is a huge plus because I find a lot of restaurants (or servers) that don't want to, don't like to, etc. to split the bill for the customers (note: my most recent experience at Rosewater and Dimmi - read my other reviews).

Definitely recommend coming here for some yummy Thai food."}
{"text":"Finally, a fantastic Thai restaurant in the north end. You must try this place if you're a fan of bright Asian flavours, fresh ingredients and warm, friendly service. 

My husband and I came to Kub Khao for a weekday lunch after hearing about it from the Chow-Toronto Facebook group. Despite it's location in a strip mall, the interior of the restaurant has nice decor and beautiful Asian design elements throughout. 

We ordered from the Quick Lunch menu which is offered between 11:00am and 4:00pm. I ordered the Chicken Noodle Curry ($9.95) and my husband ordered the Pad Thai Chicken ($7.95) which comes with a spring roll and choice of soup or salad. For the quality of the food we received, and the portion size, this is incredible value. We also received two free spring rolls each from the very friendly owner!

The spring rolls were crunchy and piping hot, filled with various vegetables and glass noodles. A green mango salad followed, with fresh, balanced flavours-- we really loved the mint in this. It kept getting better: my Chicken Noodle Curry had a fragrant, green coconut curry base, rice noodles and was piled high with fresh vegetables, boiled egg, and a plentiful amount of chicken. Just amazing! It had me at first bite. I was sure that the Pad Thai couldn't be better than my noodles but then... 

The Pad Thai arrived next: a generous amount of chicken, tofu, crunchy bean sprouts and ground peanuts. Well balanced flavour and chewy noodles. Just as good as the curry noodles. Final conclusion: Either we ordered the best two dishes on the menu, or this place has a good thing going. We were stuffed, satisfied and already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"I DON'T recommend the Pad Thai, or parking in the back. The Pad Thai comes across as a bit bland here.

I DO recommend the curry - seriously, it's so darn good - and ordering online for pick up, which is so darn easy (prices, reviews, options all posted online and easy to select).

Dine in is fine too - good service, quick response times, and smiling staff. The environment is a bit small but clean, and classy looking for such a space.

Get the curry (whether it's pineapple or another variant). I know some folks say curry is hard to mess up, but they make it pretty darn well here. Good portion size, and a rich thickness to it. Also, soft potatoes are a bonus. The pineapple curry has the sweet kick to it as well.

It's in the running for most consistent and affordable Thai restaurant north of the 401, south of the 407."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants, definitely a secret gem in Scarbaria. I come here often for lunch with my boyfriend on the weekends, and we always order their lunch specials. My favorites so far is the curry chicken noodle and the shrimp curry rice (comes with soup). 

Very nice interior, but I find it unusual that seating is at the back of the restaurant. Overall, I would definitely recommended this place to others!"}
{"text":"Great little place to get some delicious thai. The food was well plated and exploding with flavor.  The price is reasonable and the service was very friendly :). The food came quite fast and the whole setting was pleasurable for the whole family, although the place is a little small."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. Driving by the window before parking, I thought we would have to wait for a table to clear up. It turns out that we didn't have to. There's what looks like a restaurant extension in the back. It's an odd little extension. Some of the booth seating has what looks exactly like pews as seating. While I don't mind sitting in pews, I find it a tad odd in a restaurant setting. 

Had the pork with sticky rice street lunch. It was a little less than $9 before tax. Mind you, this does not include the spring roll and the soup or salad that is included in the quick lunches. I made the mistake of assuming it did. It looked like it belonged to the same category. It was a decent portion for lunch, and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the number of pork skewers that came with it. The description just says pork, not skewers, so prior to receiving my lunch, I was actually guessing it was going to be a chop. I like the skewers though. I received four of them, a container (not bowl) of sticky rice, a bit of undressed slaw, and a small dish of sauce for the skewers. It was a cute presentation. The sticky rice was not as sticky as I had assumed it was going to be. It was a tad dry for me, but I'm not sure whether that is the norm for this type of sticky rice or not. The pork was not dry and the sauce that came with it was slightly tangy, slightly sweet, and slightly salty. It was quite nice with the pork. 

I wouldn't say it's a good deal for lunch, but I also wouldn't say it's a bad deal. It's alright. I wouldn't mind coming again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either."}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly so tasty! While my boyfriend and I were in the area, we were craving Thai food and decided to Yelp good places around the area. This place had a good review so we decided to check it out for ourselves. 
Upon arrival I was kinda sketched out cause the restaurant is located in a very run down strip mall beside a gas station. But I decided to ignore that and continue into the restaurant , and I'm so glad I did! My most enjoyable part of the meal was the beef curry, it was different than a lot of other curries I had. Also the Papaya salad is a must try! I would definitely come back to try out its other menu options !!"}
{"text":"I returned to try Kub Khao again after a little more than a year. It is nice to see the option of making a reservation through the Yelp app/website or by phone (although I was unable to reach anyone when I called to make a last minute reservation for dinner). My party of 3 decided to go directly to the restaurant and chance that it wasn't too busy on a Sunday of a long weekend. Thankfully it was not very busy and we were able to be seated right away. I am pleased to note that Kub Khao has expanded their dining area in the back section of the restaurant, easily doubling the previous seating capacity. 

They still serve the same great Thai food at reasonable prices. Their lunch specials are still a great value but still only offered from 11am to 3pm. My only minor disappointment was to note that although slightly improved and a bit less sweet from the previous time I tasted it, the pad Thai is still very sugary for my palate (quite different from what is served at other Thai establishments where it is somewhat tangy). Aside from that one dish, the mango salad, green curry, and vegetable tofu cashew chicken dishes we ordered were all delicious and well balanced in flavours. Thai iced tea was also on point. Now that I know they have increased seating (and hopefully less waiting for a table), I hope to come back more often!"}
{"text":"I was very tired at the end of the day so we found this thai place and ordered delivery twice within 3 days. First time we ordered around 8:30pm, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to arrive, would have picked up since it's just 10 minutes' drive away...chicken toasts had become too soft and oily since they are in the box for too long.

Food are nice and in decent portion, and I like the online ordering system, simple and efficient.
Hope they will expand menu and offer lunch delivery (with certain amount of order of course) , and most importantly, I hope the food can be delivered within 1 hour.

Pad Thai is nice, it's my must-order dish in Thai restaurant. 

Too my surprise, I found the beef pad see ew(stirring fried flat noodle)taste even better with more green leaves and less sweet dressing, it's a bit oily as all other stirring fried rice and noodle dishes, but with a drizzle of Chinese vinegar the flavor is elevated to another level, love it!

Curry dishes are nice except for masaman curry, maybe it's supposed to taste so sour?

Moo ping is nice, chicken satay is a bit dry.

The free mango salad is okay, too sour for me, and pad Thai is in decent portion.

Will try their one plate meals for sure."}
{"text":"Restaurant is small but clean.. Came here on a Thursday night so there wasn't a line up at all. I ordered a yellow curry beef with rice and a Thai milk tea. It tastes decent but everything is super sweet. Personally I don't have a sweet tooth hence I just found the food ok. Portions are small as well."}
{"text":"I haven't had much Thai food overall but I know good food when I eat it and can say kub khao serves up some great food from my little tasting. 

Okay first off, it's behind a gas station. I didn't expect that, I almost missed it. It's also a pretty small place. Was able to just walk in 8pm on a weekday and it was fine. Food came out timely too, no issues whatsoever as others have noted. 

Started off with papaya salad and chicken satay skewers. The papaya salad was interesting. There's plenty of shredded papaya there, it just didn't taste like papaya. It was crunchy and light. Not bad overall. Really impressed with the skewers, grilled great, not too skimpy, and the two sauces were phenomenal. One is a nutty peanut based one and the other was a clear sweet/sour one. Main was the khao soi and I loved it. Nice and creamy, aromatic curry, egg noodles were great, and topped with crispy noodles. There was also a nice little kick of heat. There was preserved cabbage here, I think that just shows you how legit this place is. Everything just worked so well together. I should note nothing was overly spicy and was just the perfect heat level (you can control all this, just tell them).

Overall, just super impressed with this place and it's great to have a fantastic Thai restaurant here in the Markham/Scarborough area! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered pad woon sen beef. I love vegetables but they didn't have enough. One slice of red paprika,five slice of onions and some green onion;(
I want more veggies. 
tom yam soup was good but it was little bit different tom yam soup which I had a tom yam soup in Thailand."}
{"text":"I order take out here. The service was amazing. The girls were very very friendly when I entered the restaurant. The reason for my mediocre rating was the fact that it didn't taste very Thai. I order the pad Thai and it has a vey weird after taste. Over all it was okay for a quick Thai fix but defiantly not the best out there"}
{"text":"Try the shrimp doughnut and chicken toast! Their mains were on the salty side and were just ok...

Their parking is always full cos the lot is so small. After you walk in they seat you in the back section where it's nicely decorated. It's like two different restaurants front and back."}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai from their lunch menu yesterday before going to work. When I got there to pick it up the place was pretty busy. It's also kinda tight. Anyways, the lunch special came with a spring roll and choice of soup or salad. I opted for the salad, which is mango, red onion, in fish sauce with peanut garnish. I ordered my pad Thai medium spicy, which actually wasn't spicy, but that might just be me.

Spring roll was filled with cabbage and was delicious! Came with dipping sauce. All in all, this place was pretty good. Don't think I'd eat there cause its so cramped but would definitely do take out."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food I have had in Toronto. Authentic Thai food, the chefs are Thais. Brought me back in memory of Thailand. The restaurant is located by a run-down gas station. Not a fancy type but more a casual hang with friends place. Just like the street market in Bangkok. Highly recommended!

First picture is papaya salad, fresh!
Second picture is Chicken grass noodle, alloy mak!"}
{"text":"rate : 3.5 

Came here for lunch with a friend. I ordered the pad thai chicken on the lunch menu, came with fried wontons (they called them spring rolls) and mango salad. It was around $9. The pad thai was pretty good, I liked it but it wasn't a lot out of the ordinary. But i don't go to Thai or like Thai that much, so I can't be a very good judge of this. However, my friend said that this was the \"best thai food\" that she has had, so theres that. 

I think my friend ordered soemthing along the lines of \"pad pik chicken\" ??? it was a little spicy, but it was pretty good. She liked it. It came with rice and it was around $14. 

There was only 1 person running around, serving, cleaning the table, etc. So service was reallyyyy slow. Came at around 1:30 and actually left at 3. We ate for like 45 minutes so wait time was pretty long. Didn't mind that much because we were both catching up. But if you or the people your going with have low patience then..... However the server was really nice :) 

Overall this place was pretty good, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, and I mean very hidden.  It's in a small strip plaza with a gas station in front of it on Sheppard (don't turn into the plaza where you see starbucks and little caesars, it's not that plaza, but the one next to it which was a bit unnoticed). I'm glad we found this place for lunch because I have very picky coworkers who only want authentic food and this place did not disappoint any of them. First impression you walk in, it looked like a normal coffee shop with a takeout counter, but if you walk past the kitchen further to the back, it's a completely different feel and looked more like the pictures on their website!! Completely different feel to it right away, I guess they wanted that area for private dining or larger tables? There's additonal parking spots in the back of the plaza, so don't worry if the front has limited parking spaces. The lunch menu was amazing, comes with soup, salad OR one spring roll. My picky coworker ordered a chicken pad thai and he enjoyed it a lot!! (phew~)  I ended up ordering a la carte from the menu instead, had the papaya salad which had a spicy kick to it (PEANUT ALERT!), it is very common that many thai food have peanuts or cashews in them so be sure you tell the server if you have allergies. I also ordered the green curry chicken with rice, the spiciest of all curries and it was AMAZEBALLS! The papaya salad went well with it as well, and was very appetizing and the size was good for sharing between at least 4 people . would I come back again? Yes. Would I recommend this place? Yes."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service is terrible waiting a very long time for our food to arrive because they only care about UBEReats order first! That's bs!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai ever!! (No fake stuff like ketchup!) Omg, it was so foodgasmic!!  The nbr one thai place ever in TO!!! This pad thai was so full of flavours bursting in my mouth. I don't think I ever had such good Thai food until Kub Khao  

Cons: place is small and no reservations on fri sat Sunday...don't even think of doing a big group lunch dinner! 
Wait time: May be a long wait.. Even once u sit down, the food does take some time to come out [Good food takes time] So be forewarned and be patient. Or do takeout..
Parking: may be a little bit difficult due to limited space. If no space,  park on the streets or next door. Btw, don't recommend parking in the two spots in front of the medical walk in clinic or u might be asked by the gas truck to move your red porshe out of the way as some gentleman had to do....

appetizers:

-chicken toasts
-shrimp cakes/doughnuts

My top three dishes are:

-pad thai
-panang curry
-pad kee mao"}
{"text":"I haven't physically eaten here yet but I have had their food delivered twice.

The food is a breath of fresh air, a good Thai joint outside of downtown is very rare!

We have had Pad Kee Mao and Pad Thai both times and they were very flavorful and properly SPICY!

I haven't had Pad Kee mao in other Thai Joints before but after having theirs, I am going to try it everywhere else and compare.

If you get \"Extreme Spicy\", it is actually very spicy and even had me drinking a sip of milk, I have never had to do it for any other food.

Their food portion was also huge, we have huge appetite and I was done with one serving, didn't even have appetizers.

I am actually looking forward to eating there personally.
Definitely recommended if you don't wanna go to Downtown and have good Thai food!"}
{"text":"When my friends from Markham said that there was an authentic Thai restaurant in Scarborough, I was very skeptical. So many places here in the GTA are either fusion, too frou frou and expensive, or have been Canadianized: not my cup of tea.

It didn't look promising from the outside: it's entrance is hidden behind the Top Valu gas pumps and the front dining area is very plain in decor. The waiter asked us if we would like to sit in the back dining area where it's warmer, I said sure.

Wow! What a difference! The back is cozy with a modern twist to the regular Thai decor (please see pics); my impression was improving. 

We ORDERED:
- Chicken Pad See Ew - if you like Char Kay Teow, you'll love this dish.
- Beef Panang which comes with rice. Was med/hot in spice level, tender beef, tender crisp veggies and a thick sauce that was beautifully seasoned.
-Thai tea had a nice strong tea taste that wasn't watered down nor overly sweet. 

I was doing my happy food dance celebrating the fact that I have finally found a Thai place that balances authentic Thai spices creating a wonderful harmony of all the exotic flavors that I love."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to this restaurant under recommendation. Arrived on a Sunday at 5:30PM as a party of 4 (not sure if relevant but someone of within our party was born and raised in Thailand). She was tasked to order the meal for the party, but I assisted by browsing through Instagram and Yelp pictures to find dishes I would like. As we ordered, I pointed to a dish on Instagram and told the server we would like this. The server immediately said this is a very good dish and pointed to it on the menu under 'Appetizers', was called \"Larb\". In total, we ordered a thai iced tea, a tom yum soup, yellow curry with shrimp, chicken pad thai, and Instagram dish in which the server insisted it was \"beef larb\". 

1st dish to arrive was the beef larb. To our amazement, it did not look one bit like the Instagram dish I showed the server. We proceeded to ask her, \"sorry, what is this dish? It does not look like what we wanted\". She stated that the dishes looked very similar and is easily mistaken. Great, so I asked now what? As I told her we only ordered this dish under your recommendation but we truly wanted the one shown on the Instagram picture. She then proclaimed, and I quote, \"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS DISH IS?\" Scratching my head, I told her because you are the server and a worker here. She went on to say she will try to get it switched but has no confidence and will speak with the kitchen manager. 

She avoided us as the rest of our dishes arrived and obviously replaced it with the actual dish on Instagram. At no point did we ever receive an apology. 

Straying away from the horrible customer service experience, the food was OVERLY salted. We had to run a lot of the food under hot water to eat it. I am damn sure this is not how Thai food is supposed to taste as I've frequented the popular choices quite often (i.e. Sukhothai and Pai). There is a high correlation between taste and experience, maybe we felt the food was salty because of our horrible experience? Or maybe we were being sabotaged for causing an issue, but rest assure I will never return to this place.

TL;DR: Our server blamed us for ordering the wrong food while it was under her recommendation. She went as far as saying \"HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS DISH IS?\". Food was so salty we had to run it under hot water to eat. Never will I ever come back. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was too good, and I was way too excited to eat it and forgot too take a picture. I had the pad see ew and mango salad too go and loved it. I find it hard to find good thai places.. glad this is 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 times now and I've had both lunch and dinner. Let me tell you something real quick: dinner is going to take a hella long. Regardless of how many people you have in your table, because they are always two servers and maybe 3 cooks, it takes a long time. So beware!


I have had the luxury of having many different tastes of Thailand in Toronto and I find this one quite different. The taste isn't the same but it's still very tasty! 

I've had the pad Thai - unlike usual red tomato color, this one was on the brown side. Tastes delicious! Can't really say much more about it. 
The mussamun curry is great and on the sweet side. And the mango salad is quite big in portion so I really appreciated that.. 

Service is quite slow because there's only two people and sometimes only one when it's lunch time. So be nice to them - but if you're in a hurry, this isn't the place to be. Other than that, I would recommend you to try it out :)"}
{"text":"Food tasted great. Restaurant decoration is the best in Toronto. It is worth the price..
Mhoo Ping and the grilled chicken were the best... Will go back if we have plans in that area for sure... :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai place on Scarborough. Great curries, very unique. Try the papaya salad, it will blow your mind, but don't expect sweet. Expect spicy. The reason this place got bummed down was the service. Very slow."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss since it's right beside a gas station, but the food is great! I love thai food and this place did not disappoint. I got their regular pad thai with tofu/veggies and my friend got it with beef and we both really enjoyed it. Prices are pretty fair as well, I think it was $9.95 each for our order. We got it to go, but I will definitely be coming back to eat there since they do have available seating in the back."}
{"text":"4/5 for the food
2.5/5 for the service

Apparently the restaurant had a sign indicating that they were going to open at 6:30pm; my friend and I got there at 6:00pm, so we just hung out in the Rexall in the neighbouring plaza to kill some time.  We got there at around 6:25pm and lined up with some other people until they opened.

This restaurant is small.  There is very, very limited seating, so my suggestion is to try to get there a bit before it opens (at least for dinner time, no idea about the lunch rush).  My friend and I were seated immediately upon opening and the restaurant was full by the time it was 6:40pm... Everyone who came after had the option to wait it out and come back, or just order take out.  It was pretty crazy because once a group of people left, another group came in and were told the same thing... repeated many times throughout our stay...

We got the menus pretty quickly, but cups and water came a bit later.  It was apparently the restaurant's very first weekend (I guess they opened the beginning of the week), so it was evident they still didn't have their kitchen operations/logistics worked out... I think a majority of the people who came had stumbled across the blog articles from Toronto Life and BlogTO (this is how my friend and I found out about this place), so there was hype and anticipation that the restaurant failed to meet...  Anyway, there was really only one waitress working (the other lady is the manager?) so she literally just took orders in a clockwise fashion across the restaurant.  This definitely caused some problems because of the number of takeout orders that the kitchen had to process... it delayed some of the dishes for the dine-in customers.

My friend and I had ordered the Tum Thad, Suki Yaki Glass Noodle (Chicken + Shrimp), and Chicken Toast.  It took maybe half an hour for the kitchen to send out the papaya salad, and another fifteen minutes for the suki yaki glass noodle.  We never got the order of chicken toast because the waitress had not entered into our order (they use iPads for ordering), but it was fine considering my friend and I were full from eating those two dishes we got.

The Tum Thad is spicy.  The spiciness adds up over time because there are pepper seeds... we were a little perplexed by the sticky rice steamer that came with it: the rice was cold.  Perhaps it was cold to serve as a palate cleanser?  Spiciness aside, the salad and accompanying chicken with pork rinds were very good.  Just needed a lot of water and patience with eating it...  Also noted: the dish didn't come with shrimp chips or boiled eggs... .... ???

The Suki Yaki Glass Noodle was very good. We were both surprised by how it tasted and it did have a little heat (which also built up over time).  There were only two pieces of shrimp and a lot more pieces of chicken, so that was a bit disappointing.

Despite not getting our third dish, the food was great.  It is just a bit unfortunate how the kitchen was not prepared to handle the amount of orders.  For some people that came in after us, I overheard the manager telling them that they were sold out of the starters and desserts because they did not have enough time to prepare ingredients after the lunch rush.  (Apparently there was also a long wait for lunch too.)

My suggestion would be to wait a couple weeks to see if the kitchen sorts things out because they're just being slammed with the hype.  (I'm more forgiving about the service mishaps since it's only their first week.)  Or, if you're willing to try your luck, get there right before they open."}
{"text":"Very economical, highly casual and pretty design from cups to small flowers on table, friendly and conversive staff, tasty food with awesome presentation, best Thai Iced Tea I've ever had! Thank you for the experience!"}
{"text":"We ordered a few dishes from Kub Khao (ignoring the rating on skip the dishes which we are glad we did)...all of the dishes were delicious, but have to especially mention the Penang curry and the shrimp doughnuts...they were both outstanding!! So delicious...some of the best Thai food we have had."}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out for me except that two of the dishes were quite different than what I'm used to. This place is in front of a gas station if you have trouble locating it. 

Came for dinner with 2 friends. We had:

Pineapple Fried Rice - I like the chewy texture of the rice and the big chunks of pineapple. Added shrimp which was pretty good, large. (Need to add $1 or $2 for protein for all the mains). Portion is a bit small though (and doesn't come in a pineapple lol) This was the favorite of the night.

Green Curry w. Chicken - I overlooked this on the menu, but none of the curries have coconut milk, so I was quite surprised when it came looking like a watery spinach soup. It tasted better than it looked though, even though I love my coconut milk. This was still fragrant and quite spicy with sweet undertones. 

Pad Thai - another standard safe dish, firm noodles. We got veggie this time. Nothing really special.

Tom Kha Gai Soup - but we got the veggie option so came with broccoli and fried tofu - would be better with chicken. And instead of coconut tasting, it was sour - like lime sour, so I didn't like this one. 

We actually wanted to try the Moo Ping and Mango Sticky Rice but sold out and mangoes sour/not in season - nice of her to tell us that."}
{"text":"I love authentic Thai food and now I've discovered one that I love within my 15 minute drive radius thanks to my fellow yelpers!  I came for dinner on a week night and ordered the khao soa with beef (which is kind of like a curry soup with flat noodles, beef, onions, and beansprouts topped with fried noodles); satay chicken; and mango sticky rice.  This was enough for 2 people, as advised by the staff. The food here is so full of flavor it felt like flavors exploding in my mouth, I just couldn't stop eating it!!  I was so full but couldn't stop myself from continuing I almost drank all the curry soup and debated for another bowl of rice even though I was already overstuffed, yes it was THAT good.  My friend said I was crazy but it was just so mouthwatering!  The sticky rice to my surprise had more flavor than I expected, so yum yum yumz!!! I usually don't crave sweets, but this mango sticky rice will change u!  Noooo my poor diet!  The peanut sauce for the satay chicken was pretty out of this world as well.  Friendly staff, competitive pricing, flavorful food has left me wanting more. The lunch deals seem very good too, will definitely return to try"}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't come here sooner! The food here was good! We ordered a lot - the pad Thai, Khao soi, Fried rice and the curry. It was all very good. There isn't a lot of seating so a reso is recommended but they also do take out. It's not as good as some of the Thai places downtown, but it's def one of the best uptown. You gotta check it out. And def get the Khao soi !"}
{"text":"Heard about this place in an article on BlogTO. Seeing as I don't work too far from here, it was a no brainer. 

The location is a bit...weird. Little strip mall that is part of a gas station. The restaurant is interestingly laid out split between the front and the back. 

Service was very friendly and prompt. I opted for the chicken paid Thai lunch special ($8.95), which includes soup/salad and 3 interesting 'spring rolls' (chicken). 

I selected the soup, which was. Veggie Tom Yum. It had some broccoli, tofu, cabbage, and some mushrooms. 

The 'spring rolls' remind me of the cheese wontons served at a lot of the AYCE sushi places. They were tasty but noting to write home about. 

The pad Thai arrived in a reasonable time. It was very good. Probably top 4 I've had in the city (Jitujak, Pai, Sukko). The portion size was good despite it being a lunch special and the price was definitely right. My only pet peeve was that the plate that the pad Thai was served on was too small. As a result a bunch of food kept falling off my plate.

All in all great food for great value."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken satay, papaya salad and red curry. Really like the chicken satay and red curry was amazing. The papaya salad was okay maybe it was not in season would not recommend. Very friendly staff, a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. It can be easy to miss if you don't know what to look for. It looks more like it's a part of the gas station. It's a small store front but has additional tables at the back.

Ordered the Satay Chicken skewers, a manga salad, Green Curry with Beef and Pad Thai with Chicken. The chicken skewers were ok. Nice large pieces of chicken with peanut sauce and a sweet/sour sauce, but the satay marinade doesn't go deep enough through the chicken. The mango salad was fresh, colourful and tasted great. I really enjoyed the curry. It was coconut-y and flavourful. I just wish it was a little thicker so I could eat it better with the rice. The beef in it was ok. The pad thai like others have mentioned is a bit different from what you'd get at Thai Express. It's more brown and salty. Less sweet. My girlfriend didn't like it as much but I thought it was pretty good. (I later spooned over the excess curry onto the noodles too.)

Also ordered a Thai Iced Tea =D Overall the place was pretty cool, would come again to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"A gem of a place tucked behind a gas station. I'm so excited that there will be some great Thai food in the area. It's a small placem, so not really suited for a huge group of people but it's nice and cozy. The service seems quite harassed and continually running around, but they were very gracious and nice the whole time.

The food is great.  I had the Khao soi which was awesome and it had the crispy noodles I like so much. The soft egg noodles were coated nicely with creamy spicy curry and every bite was good. The perfect level of spicey kick while keeping a balance of flavors and textures. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time to find out what all the rave was about. I ordered their vegetable fried rice and it was quite nice overall.  It was contrary to what I've ordered at other restaurants and it had a more natural approach to it. I felt it wasn't as spicy as i would have liked. Service also could be better as I felt I wasn't being looked after."}
{"text":"Kub Khao is right behind that value gas station. Parking is to the right of it and the side street if need by.

Its a quaint small resto with a nice updated atmosphere. The staff are eager to please and on point. Food is very good and will depend on your personal preference what you like and dont like. The pad thai is great and full of tamarind flavor. If you like the fake ketchup pad thai, this isnt for you.

I would say its on par with the other big thai resto names and is a great option if you are in the area. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here twice. Good flavour. Pleasantly surprised by their shrimp donut, which is basically deep fried shrimp cake in the shape of a donut. The duck red curry was pretty good too. Their pad thai and pineapple fried rice were average, nothing special and lacked flavour in my opinion. I would come again if I ever want takeout."}
{"text":"We went to KKTE yesterday for dinner.  Everything tasted flavourful and bold.  The entree food was worthy of 4 stars no doubt.  I won't rewrite what other reviewers raved about.  I want to highlight the followings though:

1) We didn't see a parking charge station.  Looked for it.  Didn't find it.  Didn't pay for parking.
2) We weren't told the spice level could be adjusted (I asked after meal and server confirmed it).  Everything spicy ordered without spice level requests was mildly spicy.  I wish the menu or the server could have mentioned it.
3) The deep fried ice cream wasn't well prepared.  The outer layer wasn't crunchy.  The ice cream was too melty.  Even if this might be an one off miss, for $6, it wasn't a good value."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group on Saturday night and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. 15% gratuity automatically included. Summary of food:

-Curries generally too sweet (masaman and green)
-Noodles (pad thai, pad kee mao) pretty good, a little bit on the moist side, but overall flavour was delicious 
-Meat dishes were generally quite good and well presented

Possibly due to the size of our group, it did take awhile for all of the dishes to come out (like 10 minutes between the first person receiving their food and the last person). They seem to have a fairly small kitchen that might not be able to keep up with the place when it is at full capacity, plus takeout orders. 

Overall the food was decent and probably pretty good compared to any Thai place that isn't in downtown Toronto. The staff here are actually Thai so there's a bit more confidence that the food is authentic, which is good. Restaurant isn't overly large but the expansion in the back of it has practically doubled their capacity."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday.  Very limited seating but we went early so it was ok.  There was no AC but it doesn't matter to me if the food is good.

Here's what we order:
Spring roll-it's good but nothing special
Satay Chicken-chicken was moist and the sauce was good
Moo Ping-pork was tasty and the sauce was ok.  I prefer the satay sauce better
Shrimp doughnut-awesome...must order....hot and crispy and big shrimp meat with sweet sauce
mango salad-good but nothing special i can say about it

Khao Soi-crispy  and soft noodle combine with curry sauce...it was yellow curry...it was good but too rich in favor for me
pad prik chicken-the chicken was rather dry...it was with red curry....not my favourite
Green curry-omg the curry was so good that i can just drink this....very good with rice

The food was good but i think i prefer the starter than the main.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Scarborough or Markham. No lie. I wish this place was a secret, because it's tiny and already busy, but I guess people love their Thai.

Location - In a small plaza off Sheppard Ave, with the signage not clearly visible as it is behind a gas station. Free parking.

Ambiance - No frills. Simple. About 6 tables, holding max 20 diners I would say. Diners are of all ages/stages. Def saw a couple hipsters in there. Hey hipsters! *waves*

Service - Friendly but stretched. I get the feeling they were not expecting everyone to realize they are awesome! But the waitress was friendly and I got my water ASAP so I was happy. People were also walking in/calling in for takeout.

Food - Dynamite. I only ordered the Khao Soi but it was delicious - well rounded curry flavour, tons of noodles, tender beef, plus lime, bean sprouts and pickled cabbage, coriander, red onion. I felt lucky this was my lunch.

I am so happy there is finally an excellent Thai place in this area. Scarborough/Markham has excellent Asian food overall but this area was sorely lacking."}
{"text":"Hyped-up reviews!
These YELP reviewers never cooked Any Food in their lives, perhaps!!!?

Ordered:
Grilled pork with sticky rice, $9.
Beef vermicelli dish, $9.

If you like vermicelli, go to;
Kuya Willie's Kainan on Ellesmere Ave.
$6.99 short order (pansit guisado).

For grilled pork, Happy Tummy on Birchmount & Finch, is the best at $2.25 each.  

Mango salad & spring roll were very ordinary."}
{"text":"When you first walk in during a weekend dinner rush...this place might look congested with customers at the front counter...but don't worry because there is a whole NEW dimension at the back of the store. ^^

We came in a party of 2 and the waiter offered us a spot either the FRONT or the BACK of the store. We chose the BACK! It was definitely a GOOD choice :)

The front vs. back of the store was like night and day. The décor of the backroom was unique and fun. I loved the cone shaped lights- it really brightened up the room! The murals and drawings were a nice additive to enhance the overall feel. In contrast, the front gave a more modern/stern vibe with black wooden furniture and chairs.  

Vegetarian Pad Thai (no spice)- Way TOO SWEET. I don't remember ordering  my Pad Thai as a dessert? O.o

It was partially my fault because I forgot to inform the server I wanted mild spice level (she never asked for my spice level preference). Nevertheless, the noodles were cooked perfectly and there were plenty of vegetables. The dish was OKAY, I think a little spice would've helped this dish tremendously.  

Satay chicken- Love the choice of sauces which were fish and peanut sauce. I prefer the peanut sauce- love the combination of sweet and hint of spice. The chicken was very tender. The only thing was... I wished I ordered more!! 

Service was decent until we wanted our bill. We asked for the bill not ONCE but..... TWICE!! Do they NOT want us to pay for the meal? Free meal ? Fine with me :) I guess third time is the charm! They finally gave us the bill after the 3rd attempt and no apologizes were made whatsoever. Overall, the service was a little disappointing :( . 

Would I come back? Not sure. If I do visit this place again... I'm ordering my dishes at least MILD spice level."}
{"text":"The place is small so it can become quite busy. Even though it was busy the service never fell short.

Papaya salad $7.95 - tasted fresh and a great combination of sweet and sour.

Panang Curry $10.95 + $1 (chicken) - great flavours in the curry sauce. I was definitely a drinkable level type of sauce. Good portions of chicken.

Pork skewers $5.95 + $2 for plain sticky rice - the pork did not have much flavour to it and the meat was not really tender either. The sticky rice was good though and went well when dipped in curry sauce. 

Deep fried ice cream $5.95 - nice presentation. It looked like a deep fried softball. The ice cream was nice and smooth and the crispy outside batter went well together with the ice cream. 

Overall, the food was great and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"When i dont want to travel to toronto for some thai i come here. the khao soi is good but a little watery but the flavor is on point. the pad thai is not as good as other places inhave tried but still much better than any scarborough markham region. Service is good"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best Thai food I've had the pleasure of having in Scarborough.  We ordered the pad thai as well as the masaman curry.  So flavourful.  Definitely hit the spot because we are picky eaters.  My friends ordered a mango salad to share with us.  A little heavy handed on the fish sauce for my liking but my husband loved it.  Going back to this place soon I hope!  This place doesnt look fancy on the outside and is located behind a gas station at Birchmount and Sheppard but hands down a hidden gem in town."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Scarborough culinary landscape. I would say that it's quite comparable to the other popular Thai places downtown. However, they kept the prices quite similar without the decor nor service of the downtown locations. In addition, the plaza was not the best (you are literally eating in front of a gas station) and parking was limited. The dishes themselves are either hit or miss - pad thai was A+, koi soi was B-. Would definitely go again for lunch though - the prices were way better than dinner."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! This Thai restaurant serves Thai street food and it has a very casual atmosphere. The food is very tasty and pretty much on par with downtown popular Thai restaurants. It's rare to find a good Thai restaurant in Scarborough or North York that's not a chain restaurant. They serve Khao Soi which is not available at every Thai restaurant either. It may be a bit tricky to find the place because it's located behind a gas station on Sheppard just west of Birchmount. Service is excellent, and the paintings on the walls were hand-painted.  The only thing I thought was weird was the choice of music they played in the background, which was also a bit loud too.  They also have lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant.   Food was quite good and affordable.  Very busy.  I'd definitely go back to this cute local spot"}
{"text":"The food was terrible I will never eat here ever again pai is 100 times better the portion size is to small and compared to all the Thai restaurants I had especially in downtown khao Sao rao pai you can't even compare that food to disgusting khab kao one thing for sure I will never come back here again starting from the chicken skewers so small and the peanut sauce is way too sweet it felt sweeter than coke or nestea. They have to improve on the quality but for now I am never coming back here ever again"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Thai food. Spicy and full of flavour. Tom Yum soup is fantastic. They also make in house a hot pepper powder that is old school. Very friendly staff and nice atmosphere. Gets busy around lunch time but go towards the back of the restaurant and you will find many more tables."}
{"text":"Everything tastes sweet.
Spicy tung yum soup is sweet.
Chicken satay is sweet.
Papaya salad is sweet.
Pad thai is sweet.
Grill chicken is sweet.

Everything i ordered are full of flavor but tend to be sweet."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food! I really liked the Thai iced tea and curry! The wait was a bit long because they only had one girl doing everything. There's only like five tables there so either go early or make a reservation. We waited for an hour :("}
{"text":"After hearing several friends' recommendations and reading other Yelpies review about this place, we finally decided to try out this place. OMG! I love this place. Authentic Thai food that is close to home.

Situated on the second plaza south west side of Birchmount/Sheppard. It is at the back of an old gas station. Parking is limited on the front but more spaces on the left side and back of the plaza. From the outside, the place looks dark and old. After walking in the front door and saw the ambiance with old furniture, menu written on the board sort of like a canteen type setup and only 4 wooden tables, I have to looked back out if I went to the right place. By the time we were lead to our table which is at the back, you walked into a cozy, small space that can seat bigger group of people.  This section has Thai decorations and wall arts. It is furnished with cute wooden dangling lights that brighten the place. Glad they accepted our last minute reservation as we still have to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated. Place is packed. 

There were a lot of choices on the menu and it was too difficult to choose just a couple of dishes. We started with Tom yum soup with shrimp. This is good for 2 people to share. As the server brought it to the table, you can smell the fragrances of spices and herb. The spicy and sour taste just right. Next came the shrimp donut, I highly recommend this dish. Packed with shrimp deep fried with crispy batter, it is made into a donut shape served with sweet sauce on the side. Kids really love this that we have to order again. 

The next few dishes that came are all very good too. Khao Soi with beef, tasty and just the right spiciness and consistency of the curry sauce. Pad Kee Mao, I love the basil and herb taste on flat rice noodles. Red curry chicken is spicy and need a lot of rice to fully enjoy it. Pla Taud,  fried the right way, fish is crispy with hint of tamarind taste, sweet sauce on the side.

Other dishes that we had that are also delicious but ordinary is the pineapple fried rice and crispy chicken wontons.

Service is on the slow side since there were only 2 servers. But not that bad. Staff are friendly and nice. Food prices is average. Will i come back again? 100%"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I don't often crave Thai food but when I do, this is my go to place. My favourite curry there is panang curry (bell pepper with peanut sauce). It's incredibly flavourful and not spicy at all. I personally think it goes great with chicken (you have to add extra money for that).

I've also been here for lunch once and they have some interesting lunch dishes. Another must try is their grilled pork sticky rich ($8.95). The sticky rice comes in a cute little container and the presentation alone is worth trying.

One thing you should avoid is the steam bread with custard ($6.95). First of all, the bread is just Wonder Bread without the crust and secondly, the custard is hard to dip. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this dessert but it's just not for me.

The only gripe I have with this restaurant is that the service is a bit slow because they don't have enough people working. However, the kitchen is efficient and the food comes out quite quickly (as long as you don't have a big table)."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Kub Khao before but I want to specifically talk about the takeout experience.

Their website is very user friendly. It's designed really well. It's easy to jump between the different sections of the menu as well as add and remove items from your order. We ordered about an hour before we wanted to pick up the food, as you can select the time you'll be in, we had to wait I'd say 10 minutes, if even, for our food after we arrived but it was fresh and still quite hot when we got home. I should add that they do deliver as well, although I've never opted for this.

We ordered the Pad Thai, the Pad Kee Mao, and spring rolls, all were very tasty. They do not make their Pad Thai with ketchup which is why it's more of a brown colour than a bright red but it still tastes great. All in all I enjoyed their food, the service can be slow if you do decide to dine in, I think there's only 4 people who work at the restaurant and not always at the same time but they're always very friendly, I'd recommend you try this place, and check out their website, it's great!"}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday afternoon. Apparently they just opened a few days ago so they haven't worked out the kinks. The wait time is longer than normal since the kitchen was slammed with take out orders and a full dining room. Our server was really polite and nice, but she ended going helping out inside the kitchen for the most part. When she served us our food she kept apologizing and tried to make small talk. 

I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and it was so flavorful and authentic. It came with a choice of soup or salad and spring roll. I opted for the salad and it was a pretty generous serving, lots of places would charge an extra $2 for this salad. Boyfriend ordered the curry with chicken. It was good and had a good amount of coconut taste to it. 

I would definitely come back to try out their other options."}
{"text":"I have never sat down here, and only ordered take-out, since it's around the corner from my mom's house. Unfortunately, taking out decreases the quality of the food when it is traveling around in a plastic box. 

As a vegetarian, my choices are bit more limited here. I've only tried the eggplant with basil (meh), stir-fried rice noodles (alright) and the pad thai (meh). 

I have to say that the Thai iced tea is bomb and the mango stick rice was on the ball, and that the super friendly staff who are on the ball though!

Hope to come back and eat here sitting down."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend love pad Thai. We have checked out almost every spot in the GTA and Kub Khao does a great job. Great prices, food and service!"}
{"text":"I first time ordered a take out- green curry, did not like it much, the taste was pretty blend. But I thought to give it another try. I went for lunch, ordered the lunch combo, deal wise its pretty nice, choose b/w salad or soup, and a srpingroll.
I chose mango salad over clear soup. Both spring roll and salad were fine. I ordered yellow curry, which mo different then green curry, falling short of flavours. My husband ordered pad thai, he liked it. So might be they need to add more thai flavours to their curry. 

But i would like to mention their explicitly nice service. They really care about your experience and want you to come back, and try to accommodate all your needs."}
{"text":"Kub Khao is tucked in the corner of a tiny plaza beside the gas station. Hard to miss if you don't look hard enough!

Thought the place was tiny when I first walked into the store, until we were told to go to the back. The layout of the restaurant is weird, with unmatching tables and chairs. Our server was a nice and young lady. She brought us some water and took our order. 

Food didn't take too long of a wait to arrive. We got the mango salad to start and I ordered the duck curry with medium spice. The mango salad was good, although a bit too salty. Generous duck pieces filled with loads of veggies in the curry. It was delicious but also a bit too salty. I find medium spiciness to be the perfect amount of spiciness for me, but my brother did find it extremely spicy.

We were done with our food but it took us a while to spot our server and ask for the bill. The bill also took quite a bit of of time to arrive. She then came back with the machine. As I was punching in my tips and pin, our server left our dining area. I wanted to stay seated and wait until our server comes around to hand her the machine, but it turned into an almost 10 minute wait. I had to leave the machine with my untorn receipt on the table."}
{"text":"One girl who works there is very nice... everyone else has attitude problem. Decent food though. Soups and curries are yummy and amazing sticky rice. The pad Thai is not good in my opinion"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant recently. Their foods are so delish and the price is reasonable. My personal favorites are the mango sticky rice and Thai ice tea. Also, the staffs are friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a nice Thai restaurant in Scarborough, I would definitely recommend Kub Khao Thai Eatery. It's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place gets busy at lunchtime  from all the nearby offices so it's good to get there a bit early. 

The back room is where you want to sit if there is room. Anything curry is great here and the mango salad is well done.  Our fave however has to be the larb salad with beef.

Seems like a lot of people go for the lunch specials but if you feel like splurging a bit, get a variety of items and take the leftovers for dinner like I always do. 

Service can be a bit on the slow side when its busy but I go for the food, so I grin and bear it!"}
{"text":"The place is small and after a 10 min wait we were seated ... we were 4. 

For starters we got the:
Chicken Wings
Chicken Wonton
Fresh Veggies rolls

I wouldnt get the chicken wings or the wontons again... wings were oily and just didn't feel the wontons!
The veggies rolls were awesome! 
For Main we got the 
Spicy chicken Fried Rice 
Pork One plate meal with Fried Garlic + Egg
Chicken Green Curry
Choo Che Pla 

The quality was very good. Just one thing ... seems like they tried to get all our mains at the same time ... so the Fried Rice + the Pork were cold vs. the curries which were piping hot by the time it came with the other food. 
Note to Owners: Please check to see if everything needs to wait and come out together before you let hot food sit.
Would have given a 4 if not for the service being slow and some of the food being cold!
Also - they forgot to bring the Thai Iced coffee but charged us... also another error with us changing an main for the curry but were still charged for what we had first ordered ( it was more expensive)...

The food was on the sweeter side...we should have adjusted the spice level to our liking but the service was slow and the restaurant was busy ... so by the time we order we were all super hungry and our heads were not in the right place. 

Seems like the lunch menu ( price + quantity) seems more justified than the dinner menu. But given that its a Thai place it is understandable.

Might head back for lunch but unlikely for dinner!"}
{"text":"First time to eat here and the food is SOO DELICIOUS!!!! I wiil come back here again"}
{"text":"My new favourite Thai spot. We've gotten takeout from here twice now and both times it has been excellent. The red curries are really good here. I just wish they gave you a little bit more white rice for the curries. I still have some curry left over in the fridge from my order this past weekend because ran out of rice. Smoked chili fried rice is a must try here. Fast and friendly service with great tasting food. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"So I was really excited to try this place as I had it bookmarked for awhile, but I'd say the food quality is mediocre (3*). 

Not going to lie, I truly enjoyed the shrimp donuts! It was tasty - juicy and had lots of shrimp. The green curry, pad Thai and eggplant dish however didn't live up to my expectation. It was salty and super oily.

One thing that bothered me was the fact that the waitress didn't pull her hair back! I would not want hair in my food."}
{"text":"Amazing Penang curry and glass noodles. One of the very few places that offer wonderful Thai food."}
{"text":"SawatdeeKaaah(p) ! Finally a worthy Thai place nearby!!! WHopeee! I'd be doing a dance of sorts if I am to show just how excited I am at this moment but be thankful that you're only reading about it ;p Quite thankful that a friend had told us about this place because we all know how scarce Good & Authentic Thai cuisine is outside of downtown Toronto (If I am wrong, message me please). Ever since I first heard I had been wanting to try this place. Tucked in a small plaza in Birchmount and Sheppard, right behind the gas station, you will see the humble facade of this Thai eatery. The interior is small with very colourful wall decors that exhibits just the right exotic ambience you're to expect.  It can get really crowded so best call ahead. We were a group of 8 and we were lucky to land a table with minimal wait time (Sunday at 6:30PM) .  We had called ahead but still had a little wait time. Service is a bit slow so try to ignore your growling tummy and remember a little patience . It would take quite a  lot of hand waiving,  neck straining to get the servers' attention and if with luck he / she sees you before they disappear to the front.  In my opinion its because they're undermanned.  With the growing clientele I think adding another pair of hands would be wise,  perhaps adding some form of buzzing system too or both. 

Now on to the food...WE LOVE IT! Enough said. Having visited Thailand I somehow had a inkling as to the taste and I must say the flavours were spot on, aroy! well done Kub Khao! Our trusted Yelpers recommendation of the Shrimp Doughnut did not disappoint in fact I would say is the crowd favourite. Definitely a hit with the kids as they kept asking for more. 4pcs in a serving with each doughnut the size of  a hockey puck stuffed with well seasoned good quality shrimp. We also ordered the Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp (I loved this and would want to try the other soup too) Khao Soi, Pad Kee Mao (fried flat noodles sautéed in fragrant bell peppers and Thai basil - must try) , Red Curry Chicken (comes with steamed rice), Pla Taud ( Fried Fish with Tamarind Sauce also comes with steamed rice, thumbs up, definitely recommended for Spicy INtolerrants). First time I had tried the Pineapple Fried rice with curry which I had found although good just bit strange as I haven't had it done with curry before. The chicken wonton was the one dish that I felt we could have done without nevertheless we are now the wiser. The prices are not expensive nor is it cheap either. Each meat or protein added is an extra $2 which adds up to the bill eventually. You've the option no not add any but I'm pretty sure it would greatly affect the taste. We would definitely be back for more and to try the other dishes. So until next time! Kop kun khap!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and we ordered the mango salad, pad thai and grilled chicken sticky rice. The mango salad was good and portions were really big, the pad thai was okay but wasn't anything special, but the grilled chicken sticky rice was very tender and flavorful! Overall food is a 3.5/5 yet isn't comparable to Pai (located downtown). But if you are craving decent Thai food in Scarborough this is the place."}
{"text":"Service is very nice. The pad Thai and green curry are amazing. Best Thai restaurant I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Found this new Thai restaurant through my favourite Yelper, Jennifer K. 

Arrived at the restaurant at 1:30 PM on Sunday. The dining hall is full and there were a few groups waiting already. Despite a few of them gave up and left, we decided to wait. 

I checked out the menu while waiting and ordered right away after being seated. We got a snack (shrimp chips and sauce) on the house for having the long wait. Once we tried the snack, we know the long wait is totally worthwhile. The chips are so crispy and fresh; the dipping sauce is very flavourful. 

We have ordered a few items from the Quick Lunch and Street Lunch menu. 

Chicken Pad Thai $7.95 - we requested to exclude egg and grounded peanuts due to allergy. It was cooked as requested. The dish is very authentic and used tamarind sauce. Meat is pretty fresh and It is nicely cooked.  It is also comes with a fresh, hot, crispy spring roll and a choice of soup or salad. We picked the mango salad which is flavourful. 

Chicken Noodle Curry $9.95 - the curry is spicy, very flavourful and tasty. It is full of chicken, green pepper, tomato, bean sprouts and cabbage. The thick noodle absorb all the curry and very filling.

Grilled chicken with sticky rice $7.95 - grilled chicken is nicely cooked but a little dry without the dipping sauce. The sticky rice comes as room temperature. Wish it is warmer. Next time I would try the grilled pork instead. 

Drink - Thai iced tea $3.95 is very strong flavour, but I prefer less ice. 

Service - owners are friendly. Although service is slow, I kinda forgive them as this is their first week of operation. They promise more help is coming to improve the service. I don't mind the wait as long as the food is great

I will definitely go back for such good Thai food in this reasonable price."}
{"text":"Nice little gem in an unnoticed plaza in Scarborough (I missed turning in the first time). Parking is also very strange.. the parking lot is pretty empty and it might be because you need to pay?? so everyone basically just parked in the plaza literally right beside it then walked over.  Owners and staff are super friendly, but considering the day I went (weekend for lunch) they might be a bit short handed with just 2 people on the floor. Food came at a decent pace but it was kinda hard to flag anyone down.

The restaurant has a lot of natural lighting thanks to the giant ceiling to floor windows. The restaurant also stretches to the back so theres more seating than it looks. The 2 people tables are jusstttt right for 2 people if you have 2 dishes in front of you, any more and you'll have stuff hanging off the sides.

Their salads are pretty good and refreshing; mangoes are fresh with just enough dressing so that its not too sour where a lot of places can get too excited on. You also get your choice of soup which is imo wonton soup. And of course, at any Thai restaurant the must try dish is the pad thai. I have to say the one here did not disappoint HOWEVER there was a tad too much garlic used and at times overpowered the flavours. A fave of mine to have at Thai restaurants is the thai iced tea - a bit too much ice here and kind of watered it down a bit; I would ask for less ice next time. Another dish I had was their curry; now the curry itself was great, but the rice was rather on the hard/dry side, even though it would be eaten with sauce.

All in all, a place with great and courteous service, and awesome deal food (in a somewhat weird plaza) ."}
{"text":"I give 4 stars because the curry was on point! Since mango season is in, the salad was good too. Unfortunately, it was the worst pad thai I've ever had. It was so sweet, like eating Twizzlers for dinner. But at least the texture was good. The floors were a tad slippery, so be careful, especially walking towards the restroom. Going back for more curry."}
{"text":"It's definitely not comparable to Pai, Khao San Road or Sabai Sabai. They make amazing Thai food. It is a little better than Jatujak at least. I didn't mind the chicken pad Thai, the beef was a little tough in the khao soi, Thai iced tea was good and the coconut milk from the mango sticky rice was too runny for my liking. Portions were standard. 

We came in on a Monday afternoon, there were no issues waiting on food or service since we were the only ones there. The location is a little hard to find because it's in the same plaza as the (South-West) gas station. However, that extra star is for its location being in Scarborough (convenient for me!)."}
{"text":"Ok not EVERYTHING on the menu is amazing, but a few things are truly special. The green mango salad, for instance. The mangos are not too ripe like so many other places. Onions, razor thin. Fish sauce is definately more complex than the ubiquitous stuff you get at an asian grocery store. Its a must try! What else - the panang curry is a hit, as well as the green curry. If you like papaya salad, which not everyone does, these guys have a  good one for sure. The tom yum soup is also a winner. Khao soi is only for those of you who know for a fact that you like khao soi as a dish. Steer clear of the pad thai! Waste of space in your tummy, which can be filled with green mango salad instead!"}
{"text":"One of my fave dinner spots uptown! Authentic Thai food at reasonable prices. Same if not better quality as the popular Thai spots downtown - except you don't need to line up for hours!

Must get items are Pad Thai, Chicken Toast, Tom Yum Soup. 

Also a good place for takeout and delivery. 

Overall would recommend Kub Khao!"}
{"text":"Went there with my foodie parents for a Thai experience. Since I was just back from Thailand  I would really love to get that authenic experience.  
We was there during late lunch and it wasn't too busy.  We ordered a pad Thai, grill pork with sticky rice and a chicken noodle curry.  The Pad Thai is the best I've had in toronto so far. They used the real ingredients instead of ketchup and chinese soy sauce.  The grill pork is juicy and the sticky rice is not heated by microwave. ( big plus) .  I also ordered the ice tea and it's perfect.  Thanks for bringing my Thai memories back."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday evening and was guided straight to the back. The back of the restaurant was themed and decorated, like a bar, pretty cute! At the front, was more an eatery. It is oddly located behind a gas station and can be a little hard to find at first, including the parking, which I saw more at the back. 

We ordered the Thai iced tea, chicken skewers, mango salad, pad Thai and green curry with beef. The nice part of this was the curry came with rice. I liked all most of the dishes except for a couple of things. The beef wasn't the best and the pad thai was a little salty and flavoured heavily with tamarind. 

All in all, I would definitely come back for some good Thai food in Scarborough! It was decently priced too. The best was Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"Service needs improvement...The pad thai chicken came out super salty and soggy and the waiter didn't care lol. 

The tom yum soup was cold when it came out. 
The food here isn't good or special... 

The thai ice tea was good 

Don't recommend"}
{"text":"Past by this place so many times and always thought it was random to have a Thai restaurant behind the gas station. Not going to lie was pretty skeptical about trying this place until I finally looked it up on yelp and saw all the great reviews.

Khao Soi with beef ($12.95)
There was a decent amount of beef brisket so that was nice, and the texture of the beef briskets were soft and tender. Surprisingly I thought there weren't enough noodles in this bowl. The soup was really flavorful - creamy and really strong in coconut taste.

Pad Thai with chicken ($10.95 + $2 for chicken)
Not your typical red looking pad thai! It was really flavorful, decent amount of chicken too so it wasn't just loaded with noodles. The texture of the noodles were authentic. Portion wise it isn't anything like other places and smaller than usual but it's the flavor and taste that matters the most. There was a bit of a wait for this dish, but the waitress came by letting me know it was because they mixed the peanuts in with the dish (I had asked for peanuts on the side), so they had to remake it. It was nice that remade the dish instead just serving me the dish apologizing and asking to take it as is like what most restaurants do.

Will be back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Due to some communication mishap, i ended up spending my birthday here with my whole family rather than a romantic dinner for two in a nice restaurant, but i have a feeling this turned out much much better!

It was a last minute decision and i really wanted good thai food that wasn't far since we have a baby in tow. Driving down there in the snow, i was confused how there could be possibly a restaurant in this forsaken area. As GPS asked us to turn into a gas station, I was even more confused. It turned out the restaurant is hidden in the plaza behind the gas station. At this point, i'm really starting to wonder about all these fantastic reviews on Yelp. We look into the window panes and the restaurants was dark and empty!  However, the server began to lead us to the back where it became bright and packed with people that we had to wait for seats. The front was just for take out...whew!

The food is soooo good. The white american guy in the group wanted crispy wontons and the taiwanese canadian girl wanted southern fried chicken wings. Not thai food, but both were liked by the rest of our asian family.

The mains - pad kee mao was the most memorable dish. My mother wanted a soup dish so we got her khao soi - not what she expected. It also came super late and did not taste very good. The rest, a mixture of curries and stir fries were all extremely flavourful like the noodles. The spices taken with some thai iced tea really hit the spot!

Oh, I will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place through Yelp and were not disappointed.  Our top dishes were Curry Duck, Pad Kee Mow, Pad Thai, pineapple fried rice.

This restaurant is small but the setup is nice and quaint.  Service was prompt and friendly.

As mentioned by other Yelpers, this place is in a crappy looking plaza by an old gas station but otherwise so can be hard to find.  I suggest you try it out, it's worth the search."}
{"text":"This place is located in a small (kinda sketchy) plaza in Scarborough behind a gas station on the south side of Sheppard Ave near Birchmount Rd. It's easy to miss if you don't pass by the area often. 

I came for dinner and it was a good quick Thai food fix. There aren't many Thai places around the area and I would usually have to go far for good Thai food. The food here was pretty average. I enjoyed everything my friends and I had ordered. My favorite dish ordered was the massaman curry. There was lots of chicken in it! The Khao Soi was a little spicier than I had expected, but still yummy. The padthai just didn't really stand out to me at all- it was 'meh' . The food comes fairly priced in a fair portion, good for one person (or order one dish each for sharing) - I think the padthai is slightly smaller than other Thai restaurants I've been to though. 

The service was very nice, friendly and welcoming. The server answered all of our questions, always refilled our water and also brought sharing plates. 

Overall, I think it's a good place to go if you're in the area craving Thai food, or even if you live near by and want to order some take-out. The place is fairly small inside and seats maybe around 25 people? I would definitely come back if I don't feel like commuting far, and I'd definitely like to try more of their curry dishes and their Tom yum soup. :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, beautiful ambiance and amazing food!
First time visiting this gem in Toronto/Scarborough, a little hidden spot at an old looking plaza! Walked into their front door and there is this little outdated deserted seating area!
When the host asked us if we're dining in or taking out, we hesitated to sit down, but then we decided to, so the host takes us to the back, where there is a whole separate dining area and IT LOOKS STUNNING! Packed with customers, alive and the delicious thai food aromas are everywhere!!!! It was the biggest surprise, like you have just walked into a whole different restaurant!

The food are just great and 100% authentic with some real thai spices and ingredients, which elevates the taste to a different level.
I have the Satay chicken, and the Penang curry with chicken, and both dishes scored a fair 10/10

Great place and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food: 
5/5
Massaman curry was very tasty. It was slightly sweet with a hint of spice. It came with potatoes, cashews, and onions 

Mango sticky rice dessert was on point! A must try!

Ambience:
4/5
The restaurant is in a weird location right in front of a gas station. At first as you enter the atmosphere is very casual. However, the back of the restaurant is nicely decorated and gives you a more welcoming vibe. Definitely sit in the back if you want an overall restaurant experience.

Customer Service:
4/5
Overall not bad however we did have moments where the waitress was missing in action. I had to get up at one point to find them. 

Overall great food!"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to downgrade Kub Khao Thai Eatery to a barely 3 star after today's lunch experience.

Since my last lunch visit, maybe a month or so ago, the portion now is half what it used to be?! The taste and ingredients was not as good as before. Kub Khao Thai really went downhill....

And the plaza is now charging for parking?! A Scarborough strip mall charging $1 for 30 minute, 24/7, this must be the first. So I suggest you park on the side streets which have plenty of free parking instead."}
{"text":"One of Scarboroughs Hidden Gems! Hidden behind a no-name gas station at the Birchmount and Sheppard Area, lies a great authentic thai place. 

This place is a legit gem. Its a quiet place with flavour screaming dishes. Been here for a lunch special and ordered the chicken pad thai. Not your ordinary food court pad thai or from thai ex*****. Had the fried fish dish (sorry cant remember the name) for dinner at another occassion. All flavours bring me back to the authentic thai experience i had in bangkok and chiang mai. That includes the curry dishes! 

Definitely a must try for everyone in scarborough. Even worth the drive to scarborough from toronto or anywhere else."}
{"text":"Over the last few months, I've been here a few more times than I should. My food baby concurs! What I love about this place is the quality and fabulousness for Scarborough standards. On the outside, it seems pretty shabby as it's located next to a gas station and found within a rundown plaza. Wait until you get inside. My recommendation is to go to the back where there's more seating and better decor. Mind you they didn't have AC, so it was humid in the summer.

Aside from how it looks, the food is also top notch. The serving sizes are decent for the price. I've tried and enjoyed the shrimp chips, tom yum soup, pad kee mao, and red curry. My favourite dish is the khao soi with chicken. People may be on the fence about this one because there were pickles in it, but I personally liked it. Pineapple curry chicken is also a winner. 

They have lunch specials of select menu items that come with tom yum soup or mango salad and chicken wontons. Definitely can't beat the price on that. Lunch specials run from 11 am - 3 pm.

In terms of beverages, the thai iced tea is a good choice if you want a cool, refreshing drink. However, I do not recommend the Thai iced coffee as it tasted a lot like sweetened instant coffee.

The one stickler is that service can be really slow and there is usually only one waitress. I've had to motion to her for when I want to order or pay for the bill at every visit, which can be slightly annoying.

If you want a nice place for Scarborough standards with stylish food and decor, then I suggest visiting here!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is clean, very modern, and hip with their design. Some of the dishes here are very good but some are a miss. The price is affordable but for how much we're paying, some dishes can be bigger. 

I highly recommend their penang curry and chicken toast. Out of all the dishes I ordered, the curry and chicken toast were the best. Other dishes I ordered were average tasting such as:
-pad Thai: flavorful but the noodle was too watery 
-pineapple fried rice: tasted very plain, not flavorful at all
-mango salad: the mango was too riped 
-papaya salad: papaya was not very fresh, not flavorful 
-pork satay: good 

Overall, this place is good but not amazing. Some of the dishes can be improved."}
{"text":"So glad that we've found this place; now we don't have to go downtown for decent authentic Thai food anymore! The iced tea is great - it's not as sweet as most that I've had in the past. The Tom Yum is another must-try. My friends have ordered pad Thai, green curry, and khao soi - all very flavourful and delicious."}
{"text":"Real Thai food is hard to come by, unless your in the downtown area.  When I read the blogto article about Kub Khao I had to give it a shot,  because it's so close to home.  I love khao soi so I had to come check it out.  I walked in and they all greeted me with big smiles and we're pleasant, it was 430 pm so I was just missing the lunch and dinner rushes.  The smell reminded me of a thai eatery downtown  I won't mention which one!  I placed my order along with fresh rolls,  I couldn't resist the peanut sauce.  Ambiance is nice and small,  clean cut and simple.  The fresh rolls came first with 2 types of sauce to dip with peanut and mint, and its intense with the flavour.  The fresh rolls good, but I've had better. Now the khao soi was amazing.  The added touch of the Brussel sprouts and the tartness of the picked cabbage was a complete balance that brought out the different spices of course I asked for spicy.  I'm so glad to have found this place and it's so close to home.  One of the chefs sat down with me to give me some background about the restaurant.  I see that as dedication and passion for what they do. My only gripe is the location, its situated behind the gas station.  But I hope it fares in popularity to stick around."}
{"text":"Such a great authentic thai restaurant.
The price is right, price range is below $10.
Servers are also from Thailand.
I loke kost of their dish.
Pad thai, pad See eew, curry, tom yum, mango salad, khao san noodle, and their thai ice tea.
Location is not that great because its right beside the gas station but overall the food is good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends.  Had the Tom yum soup and pad Thai.

I'm glad that their spicy isn't like Thailand spicy which crazy spicy that I end up crying like a cray cray.  Enjoyed the flavour of the soup. The pad Thai is was ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is small. Waited 15 minutes for a table for 6 not bad. Once we sat down it was really hot and stuffy in the restaurant. They should turn up the AC. Service was quick we didn't have to wait long. I ordered the padthai for $9.95 extra $1 for chicken. Also ordered the panang curry with rice for $9.95. The padthai portion was kind of small in my opinion but I couldn't finish it anyway cause it was way too tangy for me. So saucy and tangy that my mouth felt numb. I forgot to tell them my spice option so I guess they assumed I wanted mild. Would have tasted better medium spice. The panang curry was good but I've had better. Nice spice and flavour to it but a bit watery instead of the thicker sauce I'm use to. Food here is alright but I think sukho Thai taste much better."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I had the chicken wings which were soggy. The chick panang was good but super oily. The service was also just ok. Nothing special, a bit awkward.  If I could rate 2.5 I would. Chicken toast was sold out at 12:30pm, very upseting."}
{"text":"It's sort of in an odd location with a ghetto gas station in front but it's a great place to come for lunch. Their specials are pretty reasonable, everything under $10 and comes with a spring roll with a choice of tom yum soup or mango salad (which was really fresh even in December)! I ordered from the street food section which doesn't come with the fore-mentioned appetizer but it's worth trying! I got the grilled chicken sticky rice ($8.95)which was so well-seasoned and grilled to perfection. The rice needs to be consumed warm or else it gets really tough to eat."}
{"text":"Very good food, the chicken toast is a little greasy but what do u expect for deep fried. I'll order pad Thai the next time but everything looks so good. The shrimp donuts where flying though the place!!! Every person ordered them as they came in, so they must be good!"}
{"text":"Thai restaruant in a questionable plaza...the front looks like a take out restaurant but the back looks like an actual sit down restaurant. The staff (only 1) was friendly but also a little clumsy and made some mess. It took a while for us to even get water. 

The food: Chicken pad thai lunch special which on the menu looks promising but when it arrived, visually it looks disappointing. But it did not taste bad, it was decent. The dish also came with a spring roll and mango salad. The salad was pretty good, the spring roll I couldn't  figure out what was in it. The Khao soi beef was interesting, it seems like a coconut milk yellow curry base soap noodle with some crispy on top. Taste wise it was pretty good, the beef was tender. Couldn't  say too much about it because I have never had this before."}
{"text":"Had the quick lunch chicken pad thai for 8.95, came with a salad and spring roll pieces, tasted like you were sitting in Chiang Mai 'rant!! Legit bold flavours from the south east here, no red sauce gross outs. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. A bit of an unusual location, with a gas bar right in front of it and pay parking for a lot in Scarborough.

We started with curry puffs, these were good. Served with a sweet chilli sauce. 

We then moved on to the mains, Green Curry and Pad Thai. The green curry was just the right amount of spicy and the curry was very well balanced. One of the better green curries I've had. The Pad Thai was really good with the tamarind sauce taking centre stage. Again it was not too sweet and had just the right balance of flavour to suit my taste. 

To drink I tried the Thai coffee. It was a bit sweeter than I'm used to but definitely had a Thai twist of iced coffee. To be honest when drinking it with the dishes it goes nicely.  If I was getting the coffee as a stake away I would probably ask for more of a coffee to syrup/milk ratio.

Overall a decent meal and a decent price. Coming in at around 30 dollars."}
{"text":"Amazing green curry chicken ($13.95) and lots of authentic Thai food! This is likely my new favorite Thai restaurant in Scarborough because of its tasty food, decent prices, friendly service, and very unique ambiance and artwork. 

Came here on a Friday night for dinner and was quite surprised by the ample seating at the back of the restaurant with walls of creative artwork of the Kub Khao name, the Thai king, The Grand Palace and other Thai art. Even the ceiling lights were hooked with a coconut mesh cover. 

For appetizers, I highly recommend ordering the shrimp chips which are crispy and satisfying to munch on especially with the peanut dip. Meanwhile, their menu does include all the standard dishes like pad thai, Khao soi, curry, and other rice and noodle dishes. I found their green curry chicken to be very flavorful and creamier than other places I've tried. Overall, servings are quite generous. 

Next, take note when ordering, there are three spiciness levels: mild, medium, and spicy. Having a low tolerance, I ordered the mild and found it spicy but tolerably satisfying. So choose carefully because either way, I'm sure you'll be sweating or wiping your nose sooner or later. 

Lastly, parking is limited at the front, but there should be several more at the back of the restaurant. If commuting by TTC, it's conveniently located at Sheppard and Birchmount."}
{"text":"Came to Kub Khao Thai for lunch today with my boyfriend. We arrived around 1pm and the place had other customers but was not completely full. We were able to get a seat right away and service was quick and attentive.

I ordered the grill pork with sticky rice and my boyfriend ordered the chicken pad thai. The pad thai came with a tom yum soup and a spring roll. My grilled pork with sticky rice came first and it was delicious. 4 pork skewers and some rice. Portion was not as big as I expected but it was fine with me since I don't eat much for lunch. I tried my boyfriend's soup and pad thai and everything was good. The total bill came up to around $20. Good lunch option if you are around the area. Would definitely like to try other menu items next time!"}
{"text":"My favourites are the pad thai, green curry with tofu and veggies and the chicken skewers.  Friendly staff. I've always ordered take out haven't dined in yet."}
{"text":"This is a little gem in Scarborough. If you want Thai food when you're in Scarborough this is the place to go. I went for lunch time and had their pineapple curry lunch special and it was delicious! It was the right amount of spicy from the curry and sweetness from the pineapple. We also got the chicken toast which was a little oilier than what I would prefer but the taste was really good, especially with the sweet chilli sauce. The Pad Thai we got was good as well. The star was definitely the pineapple curry! Would definitely come back again. Definitely would also recommend getting the Thai iced milk tea! We went in between lunch and dinner time so there wasn't that many people. However, the restaurant itself is pretty small and there are limited parking spots, which may be something to watch out for during busier times. The service was amazing there and the decor was nice, which definitely added to the experience.

Would definitely come back again!"}
