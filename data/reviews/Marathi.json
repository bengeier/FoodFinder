{"text":"Worst quality of food you could get. Ordered a small wrap (Paneer roll) costed us $18. That's a lot and it tasted so bitter and not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Some staff members demonstrate their impatience with customers by raising their voices to them. Airline vouchers policy is not explicitly explained, which creates confusion and frustration after ordering a hot meal. Vouchers can not be used towards hot meals. Unfortunate, given the prime location of this business."}
{"text":"Just ordered the chicken vidaloo $15 and the chicken Tikka Masada $14.50. Food was surprisingly decent for airport food. Unlike most reviews of this place the service was excellent. After sitting at the iPads at the bar we were checked in with to make sure we knew how to order via the iPads. Didn't order any drinks but asked for regular water and it was provided with a smile. We were asked once we ate how the food was. One tip: order an entree instead of a sandwich same price and more food."}
{"text":"Ordered their butter chicken sandwich and the Chicken Hariyali Kebab.  Both were over cooked and very dry.  I asked for a side of curry for dipping sauce and they brought be some mayonnaise crap.  Also I order a \"double\" bloody mary, there was nothing double about.  I would skip this place for another one of the airport restaurants.  I offered them my feedback and they seemed dismissive saying \"if I said something at the beginning of my meal they would have done something,\" not realizing that their service staff doesn't wait on tables so I had to approach their register to make mention leaving my belongings unattended.  Also the wait for the food was long and I would be cutting it close to make my connecting flight if I had to wait again.  Flavor was good though.  Also keep in mind dishes are a la cart so $12 for a few small pieces of dry chicken left me feeling duped."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese and caramelized onion on nan bread sandwich with mango chutney to go.  I was given a porcelain plate with a cheese and nan bread sandwich (no onion) with a runny sauce that bore no resemblance to chutney.  This cost me $16.50.  I took the sandwich back and said \"no onions, not to go\", so they made me a new one and put it in a box (I asked for it wrapped).  Second time around it didn't come with \"chutney\" but I didn't complain: I wasn't going to add that runny orange sauce to my sandwich anyway.

And then my $11 Screwdriver (OJ and vodka) contained the right ingredients but the description promised \"freshly squeezed\" -- maybe it was freshly squeezed at a factory in Florida and put in a carton, but it sure didn't have any resemblance to \"freshly squeezed\" any time in the last 24 hours from an actual orange.  Perhaps \"freshly squeezed out of the carton\"?"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave negative stars for this place. Absolutely terrible service. I understand shitty prices, as we are in an airport and that's usually expected. But there is no reason to have been treated so poorly. We're paying customers. Never again. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Don't let the iPads-on-tables suck you in!"}
{"text":"Very poor experience. Use the menu at the table like we were told. We paid for some reason on the card machine located in front of the  guy sitting across the table from us. Ordered a beer, wine, tika masala and butter chicken. Took 45 minutes and my boyfriend to get up and ask where our food was. Turns out the order never went through on the system and a very helpful lady came out and said it happens all the time. Ok no problem we waited again for our food and finally got it only an hour after ordering. Then the lady told us should would have to re-ring the order since it didn't go through but looking at our credit card we got charged twice for the awful service we received. Over $100 spent on food we waited an hour for. Do not waste your time eating there"}
{"text":"This was the only restaurant open when I booked a flight for around 1 am.  I had zero expectations since airport food generally does not generate any accolades.  It was extremely pricy. $25 for one butter chicken with a side of naan. But it was late, and curry was in order. 

The food arrived pretty quickly, around 15 minutes. The butter chicken arrived kind of lukewarm but otherwise was actually pretty satisfying, although a bit too mild for me, but still very flavourful. The portion was a regular one person sized entree. I got a side of the garlic naan for an extra $2 and tbh it blew my world. It was warm and soft but toasted around the edges. It really took the meal to a whole another  level. 

Definitely will be ordering more naan in the future lol"}
{"text":"Pros
-no line (unlike the 45 minute wait at timmies)
-At the airport so you can think of the delicious food you will get once you go somewhere else


Cons
-out of basic staples like coffee and bacon
-super rude service
-astronomical prices for Indian fusion sandwiches (hot tip , I don't want a Curry sandwich instead of actual breakfast food)"}
{"text":"Small portions. Inattentive staff (on FB on their phone while our order sat in the queue ready to be delivered). Unprofessional (snarky when asked a question). Not as described food. There are other options."}
{"text":"Marathi has it's good and bad. I was stuck at Pearson for 24-hours so I got to know the food scene well.

The food at Marathi is a Canadian/North American version of Indian food. It's not overly flavorful, not spicy, and it's very expensive for what you get. The chicken tikka masala is not worth $15. Staff are kind of non existent. Dirty dishes can sit at a table for hours - truly hours before they are taken away or cleaned up. 

On the plus side the seating is great. The chairs and all wired with ipads for entertainment, news, and ordering. There are plenty of charging docks, but good luck getting 4 seats together for groups."}
{"text":"Wish there was less than star, preferably a negative star or stars. Have just ordered what would, by any standards, be considered a higher than averagely priced basic Indian meal in Toronto. The tables are sticky and littered with the debris from previous meals. The sever's response to our request to clear and clean? \"I'm busy now. Later\".

Update: The server whisked a napkin over the tables and brought the food. My advice to anyone who is inclined to try this dive? DON'T!"}
{"text":"This is a very good Indian restaurant for being inside an airport. First off, Toronto Pearson Airport is very tech savvy as you order from an iPad and you get to see pictures of the food you are interested in. The whole family ordered Chicken Biryani because we are familiar with it and it did not disappoint as it was very flavorful and had only a mild kick. Other dishes looked good as well but we were strapped on time and wanted to go for the sure thing. The portion is decent sized and will leave you satisfied. Definitely recommend trying if you are in the international terminal."}
{"text":"Airport departure lounges are usually pretty dull places but this eatery is great. Every table has an I-pa"}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, my service was good.  Beer arrived in 3 minutes and food in 10.  The chicken vindaloo was quite flavorful, not what you'd call subtle or nuanced but I enjoyed it.  

Prices are comparable to any other airport option, meaning 40% higher than you'd find outside the airport, but blame Pearson for that.

Also because you pay up front, you won't need to wait for the bill."}
{"text":"Very nice airport restaurant with efficient ordering via iPad. Food is nice but not exceptional. Nevertheless, it seems the best place to wait for a flight."}
{"text":"Fancy ordering system with iPads.
Investment would have been better in food. Coffee not good, cold and v expensive at C$3.50. Service was pretty quick but airport not v busy at the time"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food but fairly expensive. They do have a solid drink menu and you can order at the table. The server was very attentive. I suggest the butter chicken with raita."}
{"text":"Amazing, I did not think it would be that good since it's at an airport. But highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absurdly expensive. Decent food but hardly any. You can't fill up on this. Not worth the price. Go elsewhere. go get a burger at the burger joint. Not many options in international terminal."}
{"text":"A few new places opened up recently in the Pearson Terminal 1 International departures and most of the flashy places are attached to a celebrity chef.  This one is supposedly helmed by Chef Bhagwani who owns the Amaya chain in Toronto.  The open bar/restaurant is visually appealing... tons of gold, oranges, and glass accents are everywhere in a very modern soaring area.  White bar chairs complete the elegant look and provides a comfortable seat.  The scents of Indian spices are familiar but unfortunately, this is where the pleasant part of the review ends.  Similar to Fetta, the staff isn't focused on service and the food here is not much better than President Choice frozen Indian dinners.  To put salt into the wound... the prices are high compared to the $2 at Superstore for the same.

I can understand why everything is pre-made as there really is no kitchen in this bar. It has a tiny section where they can warm up your food in a pan but that is it.  No real cooking is visibly done here.  My colleague ordered a chicken tikka masala and figured who can screw up this easy and common dish... well, it appears that Marathi can.  It arrived in a fairly stale bread who's crust has seen better days.  The meat itself wasn't hot but instead lukewarm and that was a bit disconcerting.  The butter sauce was really oily and heavy which probably isn't a good thing before a flight out and according to his taste buds, it was bland!  He did mention the only flavour he got was really the onion as it had a lot of it and very little other vegetables (even though it mentioned it supposedly had peppers). 

For $14, it should have been edible but my colleague just ate a quarter of it before going to Fetta to grab a ham sandwich.  The sad part of this tale was that the server took the plate away and asked if he wanted anything else.  My colleague did mention all the issues and all he got in response was a shrug.  Service with a smile....?   Not at all... more like taking your money and laughing all the way to the bank."}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant. Poor service, rude staff, and inedible food.

It is possible that the cook has never tried curry

I went to talk to an employee and he just turned me around"}
{"text":"Honestly the only thing I didn't like was the price. SUPER expensive but I am just so happy that there were vegan options!!! The spinach and black bean burrito was literally one of the best burritos I've ever had. Can't complain besides the price."}
