{"text":"I was promised by the towns locals that I could get their legendary bacon wrapped chicken wings.....but the waitress said the cook wouldn't make them for such a large order (45 wings) so I asked if they would just do 10, to which they said no. So......i guess I don't get any wings! but in all fairness it was 4am.....but still if you make a certain dish and that draws people to your place......you should probably make that dish!"}
{"text":"I just ate there this morning.  Just like almost every restaurant in Ambridge, this place is awful.  Hash Browns?  A pile of warmed up potatoes with no seasoning.  Not heated, just warmed.  Not browned and crispy like hash browns are supposed to be, just lazy cooking.  Why would a restaurant hire a cook that has NO IDEA what they are doing? WHY?  Why would railroad workers put up with this crap?"}
{"text":"Food is okay - nothing to praise. The service is terribly slow; I had to wait 50 minutes just to get my meal, and it wasn't even busy. I have heard from other friends/family that they have had poor experiences, too."}
{"text":"Terrible ..... Very very unprofessional staff and extremely unsanitary food preparation .... No gloves no hairnets witnessed food dropped on floor and served would never suggest this place to anybody I would not let my dog eat there!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch several times I have been here.  The place is great looking and clean.  As it is new, some of the wait times were as expected, but it is easy to tell they are working out the kinks.  One of the most modern restaurant facilities in the area.  I have yet to try breakfast there but lunch was great.  A simple menu, but for the area, and demographic, this works out perfect."}
{"text":"Went here twice while I was home and the second time I cleaned my plate. This is an off the beaten path diner with a true diner feel. When I say true diner feel, I mean they will make you wait forever for service. Well at least the food was good. Both times I got breakfast. Loaded locomotive with no mushrooms. The only issues I had with the food was that everything was touching. Eggs on top of potatoes, cheese on top of everything. I'm just not a fan of my food touching. The waitress was kind enough to give me coffee to go that she fixed for me and everything. Much appreciated! This random little restaurant is a hole in the wall but the food was good. I would definitely go back.   Also....good to know...they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a hole in the wall but we get take out here for my office and it is always delicious.  I especially love the turkey club and the honey mustard that they use.  Give it a shot. And its very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I tried the Loaded Locomotive; which is home fries or hash browns, onions, bacon, peppers & mushrooms topped with 2 eggs (done your way) and cheese.  This would have been good except the bacon pieces were way overdone and hard, plus the sunny side up eggs I ordered came out more like over hard.  If it was done correctly, I could have had the yolk oozing over everything making the dish so much better.  Husband had the country fried steak which was a good size portion.  For his sides he got mashed potatoes & cottage cheese.  The funny thing is the server (who I think may have been a cook filling in) put the cottage cheese in more of a soup bowl.  There was probably 2 lbs of cheese (we took most of it home!).  Said his was ok."}
{"text":"What happened to this place Used to have late meal at least twice a week there. Now very little wait staff. Kitchen very slow. I have to admit food still pretty good but takes your whole  lunch hour to get in and out. Its like no one cares anymore."}
{"text":"Tyler the cook/server was fanominal! Couldn't ask for better service and food!"}
